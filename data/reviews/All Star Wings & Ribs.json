{"text":"Used to love this place. For some reason, it's gone downhill-- though they've recently renovated and the FOTH looks great. Doesn't make up for the fact that their wings are small and dry and expensive.."}
{"text":"Wings!!
All star wings & ribs.
I would have to agree with the name, these are definitely *all star wings* lol.
I've been here a few times and always left satisfied. The wings are awesome. Never tried the ribs though... Doesn't appeal to me. 
There are like a hundred flavours of wings to choose from. I'm very limited though because I don't eat spicy.

My Personal Favourites:
Poutine
Honey Garlic

Great place, great food, decent service.
Definitely recommend any wing lovers to check it out."}
{"text":"Food is very good but I can not believe that they do not accept American Express card! This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The servers are always friendly, especially the beautiful Sara. And they keep the drinks flowing and the food coming.  It can be pretty slow on a random Tuesday night at 10pm and sometimes, although I can never understand it, servers are upset to see large groups come in - but not here!  In fact, the last two times, the manager has come over and sincerely thanked us for coming in."}
{"text":"I moved away a few years back, just as this place was really getting going.  And every time I come back to visit, I always made it a point to stop by here for some delicious wingage.

However, my last experience here was just terrible, as far as service goes.  Actually the wings were pretty terrible too.

I went in on a weekday, around 1pm.  I put an order in for 50 wings, the place was pretty packed because it was the winter holidays and there was a party going on or something.  There were two waitresses running around like they didn't know their ass from their heads.

I placed the order and the waiting began.... and I watied... and waited... and waited... 45 minutes later, not a word of status from the waitresses.  Another patron walks in and places an order.  And we wait.

and wait... and wait...

5 minutes later another patron walks in and order.

and we wait... and wait... still no communication from the waitress, not even a \"oh, the kitchens backed up it'll just be a few more minutes\".  Not even an offer of a pop or even water!  Or even friggin peanuts!

and we wait... 20 minutes later... our order comes out, well HALF of our order.  And the second patron's order too.  She leaves... I wait...

and wait... 15 minutes later I get the rest of my order... 

So let's see.. that's a total of 85 minutes to get an order of wings... without any notice... without even a \"I'm sorry it took so long\" when we finally got the food.... without a \"oh it's going to be a while, why don't you have a seat instead of standing there like a fool\"... not even a \"Well, can I at least get you a drink while you wait?\"....

I finally get home, tell my family to call off the search party for me... and we open our wings to find that on one of the orders, the wings were not fully seasoned and it looked like someone just squeezed a bottle of sauce arond like you would ketchup over a bucket of fries.

Terrible.. place has really gone down hill..."}
{"text":"Duh, where else would you go if you attended a high school in Richmond Hill.
Gross salads but you're weird if you order salad at a wings joint anyway. 
Most flavours are pretty good, but you'll definitely hate yourself and contemplate your BMI after.
I recommend all the spicy, garlic, and parmesan ones."}
{"text":"Love the new renovation!  Waitress was nice but they seem under staffed. Visit on Mondays for the special and order the specialty fries. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites.  There are over a hundred flavours now that they expanded the menu and before that I had tried every flavour (about 80).  The service is always fast, which means that the wings are usually hotter (in temperature) than the average place.  There aren't many tables or much space and it's really popular so you may have to wait during prime times.  

As for recommended flavours, Pandora's Box, Texan Ranch, Snake Bite, ..., and if you're looking for a coronary try \"cheesy where's the beef\" which is poutine on wings."}
{"text":"Wings and beer. Need I say more? Tons of flavours to choose from but one can never go wrong with hot-n-honey."}
{"text":"The menu says there's 200 flavor but it's really just a combination of the same basic flavored. There's nothing special about that.  

The waitress didn't know what beer her sports bar served ... What!? She told me that Coors light was Canadian beer. The beer selection was weak. 

The menu lacks description, so what if I had allergies or I didn't like a certain flavor. I had no idea what some of these flavors meant. The waitress probably wouldn't know that either. 

I ordered the .. 

Honey Garlic Wings: very bland and where was the garlic taste/flavor? 

H Bomb: second most spiciest wings on their menu, yeah it was off the roof spicy ... But there were no other flavors BUT spicy. 

Texas  does Caesar: it was very heavy and saucy in a way that's not good. I feel like they just slapped on the sauce and call it done. 
 
Greek Fries: they were okay but very heavy and soggy. I love soggy fries but most people wouldn't ... 

There was this one lady who was very attentive, maybe she was the manager or something. She was great above and beyond but that still couldn't makeup for how bad the food was."}
{"text":"Well everyone ordered wings so I should have followed suit. They said the wings were good. The pulled pork was Just ok, bread was hard so I didn't eat it. Fries were warm not hot. Ginger ale was less than bubbly. Service was slow. Outdoor patio is a nice option but beware of wasps. The wings are a hit for them."}
{"text":"My favorite wings place of all time! Have been here many times and always a good experience. Service is always good and fast. The size of the wings here are pretty big. My favorite flavors are Wings Gone Wild and Mardi Gras. Great flavor and crispy wings. Never disappointed me. I have been to another location but for some reason it didn't taste as good. Probably didn't the sauce right on. Will always come back here for wings! Even got my mom to love it!"}
{"text":"Wings are actually pretty good here.  We ordered two single orders of wings.  Roasted garlic with peppers and Ceasar meets Texas.  The roasted garlic was very salty, I am a pretty salty guy but it was really really salty.  I actually had to drink pop to relieve my thirst from the salt.  The other flavour was basically a little bbq sauce covered with ceasar dressing on it.  There are a million different sauces you can choose here, wish they had a small description to explain what each one actually was.  i guess that is what the waitress is for lol

didn't get a chance to try anything else here.  but taking a peak at other tables, things looked pretty decent.  

i am a wing kind of guy, and the wings here are a pretty good size and cooked very well.  but need help with the sauce selection!  

prices are pretty average here.  $11 for a pound, which is about 10 wings.  no fries... and i have noticed that there must be a shortage in carrots in the world.  went to several places where carrots seems to be absent.  does anyone else noticed that???   not a big fan of celery and there seems to be a lot of those given.  

will i come back... sure!  but will do a little research about sauces there."}
{"text":"Date & Time: Friday at 3:30pm
Party size: 5
Weather: Overcast 

Sides:
Greek fries
Jalape√±o poppers
Greek fries (again)

Wings:
Lemon pepper (dry)
My ranch is on fire (4 flames)
Pandora's bomb (5 flames)

Server: young lady, possibly an older teen. She was attentive to our needs and social with the patrons.

Atmosphere: not enough tvs, also the audio didn't sync to the program. While they were playing game 5 of the 1991 NBA semi finals between goldenstate and the lakers, the dreaded music selection of Virgin Radio was like nails on a chalkboard in my skull.

Cost: depends on how long you stay. 

Cleanliness: I was watching the reflection of a tv for 20 minutes before realizing that it wasn't a real tv (the image was crisp so this concludes the glass was spotless)

Pros: the food was cooked, which is a good start to every outing, it was also served quickly and piping hot.
The Greek fries upsized to  beer battered fries made us all go Mmm.

Cons: the lemon pepper wings were a little light on the seasoning and we couldn't tell if they were breaded or not. The second round of Greek fries came out with normal fries, so we determined that our server wasn't a successful mindreader.

Recommend? Yes. It's a great little place to find wings."}
{"text":"The wings here are AMAZING!  They have 200 flavors; the three we tried were each delicious.  (A customer we met when walking in recommended to avoid the breaded style.)  Modest but adequate beer selection and full menu; seems to be a popular place - even on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Can get busy, reservations may help
Nice sports bar environment
Stone bar
Cute waitresses
Good service
Tasty salmon
Plethora of wing flavors I stay within 3 stars and I'm comfi
Fries sometimes filled with oil/ grease big nono ie. Caesar fries

Nice spot for a casual drink"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here. today i came back to take advantage of the wings special (monday night they add half an order for same price)

I found out that now you need to order a drink to get the special. huh?

and the wings are..... from chickens that are in need of some steroids or something. they're tiny now. 

and there were 2 waitresses for the whole restaurant (including the bar) as a result it took a long time to order, get food, get drinks etc. We witnessed MANY people complain of this. 

Seems like it might be new management since none of the wait staff looked the same - will go to a different location to see if this has spread to other locations.

soo.... in summary: higher prices, smaller wings, reeeaaalllly slow service.

oh yeah and free wifi seems to have been shut off now."}
{"text":"This is our fav wing place!!!  We always get the honey garlic, and our new found favour (something Italian)."}
{"text":"Place is nothing too fancy .. Wings is very small I would suggest going to the yonge street in richmond hill ...however the caramel cheesecake is very delicious"}
{"text":"Come here with friends everytime were in the area. Had a great time. The management is great"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Food is dry and tasteless, waiter is rude, pop is flat and to top it all of the place is full of flies."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and place was pretty full. We were seated at the front table which was a little drafty due to the cold March night. We ordered the desperado and Caesar does Texas and we were impressed by how flavourful the wings were. Waitress was also really great, she even checked in on us before going on her break. Would've been great if there was a wing special that night!"}
{"text":"This place was good. But it looks like they have gone cheap, with small wings for a big price. The service is it and miss. Mosty miss"}
{"text":"1. Employee turned off a Canada vs USA hockey game and turned on Boston vs Utah basketball game. WTF?!?

2. Place is depressing enough to be a popular post-funeral eatery."}
{"text":"- about $1/wing - that shit is pricey!
- they have every imaginable flavour including t-rex and unicorn
- waitresses are better than Hooters and the asses make up for the lack of Leafs games on TV right now"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!!!  They do not value their customers!!  They totally take your business for granted as they think they are the only place to go to for wings.... Honestly, there're are a lot more better places to go, you just need to do a little research!!!  But if you really love All-Star Wings, avoid this Richmond Hill location!!"}
{"text":"One of the best locations in my opinion. Wings are mostly always on point here compared to all the other ones, the Greek fries are amazing and the service is top notch. At one point was almost coming here once a week."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times for lunch.  The place is generally empty and we sit in the bar area.  I would not recommend this place of you have only an hour or less.   The service is super slow.  One time we watched the staff talking in the back for a half hour and when she came to take our order she said she didn't know anyone was there.  I guess they don't expect any customers for lunch.  Weird.  Another time the waitress was too busy sweeping and than filling up ice. Always with an apology for the delay.  The food is okay but overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for wings on a weeknight. And it wasn't busy maybe 4-5 tables. Came in and 2 waitresses were at the bar. One on cellphone the other getting drinks. Both saw us waiting to be seated yet person with cellphone walks in to the kitchen and the other waitresse serves drinks and then also walks into the kitchen. Waited a few more minutes and nobody came back to seat us so we decided to leave. I used to come and service was great but guess this place is going downhill. Not to mentioned people were smoking in front of the entrance so had to walk through a cloud of smoke. Place to be for no service and a side of secondhand smoke."}
{"text":"This place went down the drain. If you want some good wings, stat away from All Star Wings. Service is terrible and food is far what is was before."}
{"text":"Ehh...it's okay here.

The wings are kinda skinny and sometimes dry :/

Basically everything comes in a basket (can't remember if the nachos do or not). 

Their flavors all have clever names so its kinda hard to tell exactly what you're getting when you order. You have you double check with your server to be sure. You get about 8 or 9 wings in a single order.

It's close to me so I go occasionally but it's not a favorite you have to go kind of place.

Try if you'd like."}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday service was great

I have been a few times and I get the grilled wings every time,, it's the only place I know that have them (that I know of )
Have always enjoyed them

But yesterday they where very over cooked and dry, not a good experience one of the worst but it didn't occur to me to send them back and I find that risky as I don't trust the cook to not foul my food

But this alone would not prompt me to give a 1 stare

Its that I was got sick and was sick for 24 hour after , it was bad and im sure they where spoiled or the grill was not clean
So I will never ever go back,,  I feel the management may have changed since last time I was there but what ever the reason stay away 

Ps ordered fries, they where freezer burned and or not cooked properly either"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great place to chill with friends or family! We ordered 3 different kinds of wings from the giant selection and all 3 were great. we also ordered nachos which were also amazing as well as greek salad. The greek salad wasnt the best but the rest of our meal made up for it. I recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Great service!  and great food!   Can't ask for much more, nor do I expect much more from a wing restaurant.  I'd suggest their Richmond Hill or Woodbridge location though as the restaurant is much larger.

They claim to be serving Cheese Cake Factory desserts as well....Great Addition!"}
{"text":"Man, this place isn't hopping like it used to be back in the day. Though their renovations have done wonders to open up the space, they just aren't cranking out as many covers as they did once upon a time.

Saturday night, 6:30 pm, and we were the only ones dining in. The Wings are consistently good, though I do notice small differences since the change of ownership a few years ago. Most notably, the Blue Cheese dipping sauce that is barely filled even a 1/3 up the little cup it's served in. Come on now, would it kill you to fill the cup with a tablespoon more? Even if you pay for an extra dipping sauce on the side, you only get a measly tablespoon and a half of sauce.

We usually get Prime Time, Nero's Epilogue, Desperado, Wings Gone Wilder, and/or Hawaiian Eruption. This is definitely food you only want to eat twice a year. You feel great on your first wing, you feel horrible by your last, lol. So much grease!

Since the change in ownership, the service has been inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, other times we're completely ignored."}
{"text":"All Star Wings & Ribs, why are you so delicious? Best Wings Place I've been to by far. You can tell someone is a n00b when they order flavors like Chocolate, Bahama Mama, Jerk, Mesquite, or Honey Garlic. You don't come all the way here to get Honey Garlic wings... they have over 100 other unique flavors to choose from!

Here's a list of favorites in no particular order:

My personal favorites:
1) Cleopatra
2) Cesar Does Texas
3) My Ranch is on Fire

Crowd favorites: 
1) Cheesy Where's the Beef
2) Wings gone Wild
3) Pandora's Box

Oh and the Jalapeno Popcorn shrimp is also really good. I like that the outside is super crunchy! Though it could use some more jalapeno...

Whenever I come here, which is about once a month (it's that good), I come with a large group and it comes out to about $15-20/person (tax and tip included) but we leave very full and very happy every time! Oh wait, except this one time. When the new location first opened at 10520 Yonge Street, for some reason the wings had shrunk to less than half its size. As regulars, my friend and I were quite disappointed to say the least, even the waitress couldn't deny how ridiculously small the wings were, but they were pretty quick to fix that because the next time we went (a few weeks later) the wings were back to its full size, yum!"}
{"text":"If you're into wings, this is definitely a place to check out. It's a typical sports bar in a lot of ways. Where it stands out is in the choices of wing sauce. I think the one complaint I have is that there are so many choices (something like 100) that even the wait staff didn't know all of them. It would be really helpful if the sauce names came with at least a couple word description. Service was mediocre but the wings were well-cooked and seasoned (even if a few combos were beyond weird)."}
{"text":"It's so fricken busy here you have to expect  you have to wait. But it goes to show you how popular this place is.

This is \"the place\" for wings. Selection galore, and done perfectly and consistently. 

You know one thing I find weird is that I see children here. The layout is a bar with scantily dressed waitress'. Who brings their kids here? Parents thinking with their stomach's instead of their brains."}
{"text":"Today for our Christmas Gift Exchange my best friends and I came for some wings to this location. 

They had their 1.5 lb Monday Night special. Our server was very polite and kind. The place was fairly quiet. 

When the food arrived we were surprised to see only 11 small dry pieces were in their \"1.5 Wing Basket\". The price is the same as their 1 lb when you order a drink. Perhaps because the price is the same they don't give as many pieces. 

Most places give on average 9-10 decent size pieces for their 1 lb which would have made their 1.5 lb to have about 14-15 pieces. But not here. My drink never arrived and I asked to cancel the special and just get however many pieces need be to be removed and simply get the 1 lb (they were the same price anyway) and not have to pay for a drink that never came anyways 

My friends and I have been to this location many times before but the quality of their food and their portions are getting worse consistently. The only positive is the politeness of their servers, aside that they often forget the celery sticks and dips that come with the wings, and they never come to refill the\"bottomless drinks\" 

Aside the poor quality and small portions. The manager stopped by our table (we never asked to speak to him) he was disrespectful, aggressive, and was yelling. 

He said \"you are wrong\" 11 pieces are 1.5 lb even though they pieces are small 1lb has 7 pieces. After arguing and yelling at us, he wasted 15 minutes of our time making our food cold, just to say we were wrong. How shameful. Such poor service. Ruined our evening. 

Sem (the manager), ruined our night, and had the worst customer service skills. They'll lose more of their customers if this poor service is to go on. 

We will not be going there again, much rather go to St. Louis or Duff's. Better quality, great service, and better prices. 

Never have I seen a customer service and management this bad."}
{"text":"Prime time wings are the best here BUT I wanted the chocolate peanut butter cupcake and they said they didn't have it cuz of people's allergies which doesn't make sense (it was on the menu). I opted for the white velvet coconut cupcake ($2.95), it came out frozen. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad place, music a bit too loud. Also the decor is very...sloppy? I know they took over the old east side Mario's but feels like they didn't spend any money on renovating. The wings are good but very greasy, after having like 10 wings I felt bloated and puking from the grease. Fries are fresh cut and the gravy isn't too bad. Overall a good place for wings"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot rod wings and fries and gravy. The menu was odd, there was no description of what would actually be on the wings. My order took 10 minutes to prepare, I took mines to go. Service was fast, considering no one was there (12pm on a tuesday). 

The price is a bit pricey for my liking. The wings weren't as good as I was expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high. I really enjoyed the fries and gravy, yummy.

I don't think I'll go out of my way to eat here. It was giving me a bit of a hooters vibe, not that I mind!"}
{"text":"If your craving for wings all stars is your place to go.i have been there many times and the experience I had was fantastic the waitresses were super nice the menu is large it has  many selections even if you're not up for wings.the size of the wings are big and you get your money's worth. My favourite flavour is honey BBQ if you want sweet and spicy but not too spicy or Pandora's box which is a little spicy I will always come here and I have got my family and many of my friends to like it so I hope this helps you"}
{"text":"No doubt, they have delicious wings. 
Large menu. 

Take out service is okay.
Prices seem to be a bit above average/against other competitors."}
{"text":"Great place to break your diet. Great wings and plenty of different flavors. We liked the service and appreciated our friendly and patient waitress."}
{"text":"I don't know why people say this place has gone down hill. I LOVE ALL STARS. I haven't had it for years and we recently got it this weekend. It was as delicious as always and it was take out ! 
We got the famous 
Cesar does Texas ...which I HIGHLY recommend . 
Scorpion kiss ....which is my favourite . Hot and honey mustard. 
Col. mustard Honey.... Too much honey for me . Bbq honey flavour . 
Hot blonde ....I don't like that Louisiana hot sauce flavour but other then that it was good because it has blue cheese sauce as well"}
{"text":"Came for wings with friends and was very happy. Wings are probably twice the size you'd get at other wing restaurants. Good service, good food, can't complain. 

I don't eat wings often, so this is the place I'd go to if I did. Other places are definitely sub par to this place even though the prices are bit higher. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ten of us came to All Star Wings for a birthday dinner, and to be honest, I wasn't so keen on coming here because I experienced severely dry/tiny wings at their Woodbine location, but this location left me pretty da*n impressed! 

The restaurant was PACKED as it was a Saturday night, and the UFC game was on. So there were many people standing around, loud and a lil' drunk. This brings us to WHY I was so impressed with our waitress. She was somehow able to zig zag through the hoards of people blocking her path and kept our drinks refilled, at the same time constantly checking up on how we were doing. She had no problem giving us separate bills, and had such an upbeat attitude we might as well call this place All-Smiles Wings. 

We ordered 100 wings to share, and they were so GOOD. Nothing like the Woodbine location, the wings were longer than my thumb and very meaty & tender. There are so many flavors to choose from - some with complicated names, that our server was happy to explain what they actually were. 

What's there not to love when good food is complemented with good service? I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Recently stopped by this all stars for some take out for the family. We ordered four pounds of wings with each pound having a different flavour. The flavours we ordered were:

Pandora's Box - this is pretty much sweet and spicy combined with honey garlic, it's not bad, although you couldn't really taste the difference between this flavour and actual honey garlic

Honey Garlic - self explanatory, it's hard to mess up this flavour and all stars does not mess it up

Caesar Does Texas - creamy garlic and parm with some chipotle, one of my favourites, highly recommend this flavour

Nero's Epilogue - basically a much spicier version of Caesar Does Texas, if you like a kick with your garlic parm this is the flavour to get. 

I checked in on yelp and they still honored the 10% discount even though it was take out, good on you All Stars at Elgin Mills!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just old school...
But I feel wings should come in 5 basic flavours.

BBQ. Hot. Medium. Mild. And some variation of honey garlic.

Hit or miss with their flavors.   
Some are tastier than others.
No descriptions on their menu because they have SO many flavors.
What a fun guessing game...

If you secretly wanted Greek food, they have 5 flavors that resemble something Greek.

If you secretly wanted Thai food, they have 5 that resemble something Thai.

Have you ever written an essay that you felt needed a bit of padding.
You add all kinds of words and start repeating the same point over and over again - but rephrase it slightly differently.
But really, you could have gotten to the point in like, 5 sentences...
Maybe more than 5 sentences, perhaps 20...."}
{"text":"Check your bill!!  They're ripping off everyone by automatically adding 15% tip but it's actually more than 15%.  $1 extra doesn't make a difference but it's not right if they're doing this to everyone.

Our bill was only for 2 people -2 LBS and 1 pint."}
{"text":"I've been here 20+ times. It's really close to where my husband and I live and this is where all our friends hangout and grab beers. They have a realllllyyyy big wing flavour selection. It always takes me a while to decide what I want because there's so much to choose from. The food is great here and the atmosphere is great. The waitresses are nice and attentive. Overall this place is really good."}
{"text":"Supposedly this is the original All Star Wings & Ribs?  

Sports jerseys, photographs of athletes, and other miscellaneous items associated with recognition decked the walls like a teenager's basement.  Ah..All Stars, I get it.  

I came here with Chris at precisely 11pm on a Monday evening, and after being seated by the waitress we were told that we had until 12 to basically get out.  Politely, of course.  We were so damn hungry that we nodded our heads like two sodding dogs.  With so little time, we kept our pretentious menu critiquing to a minimum and just got the wings basket with fries, and a side order of calamari.  Our food arrived in under eight minutes, and we dived into it like a pair of sports fans.  
I couldn't believe the portion of my order.  I think I got the dozen wings with fries.  I was glad to see that the wings to which the chickens it derived from were not anorexic, but showed signs of being well fed, and the meat was not at all dehydrated as I have originally expected.  They gave me so much fries I actually had to use my 'eating at home' techniques to pace myself for our 40 minute time limit.  No worries, there were only three other tables here and none of them was facing me.  The side calamari was also quite generous. 

There's a full bar at the front of the house which seemed much more than necessary, it could have sat at least six XXL hockey jerseys comfortably.  There were televisions mounted at all angles of the restaurant, and because it was so late, I was actually comfortable eating here without the screaming fans.  

We managed to finish our food with 15 minutes to spare, which allowed just enough time to get the bill and relax for a moment.  This isn't food I would ever get a craving for, but I must admit I had a hardy meal, and I damn well enjoyed it. 

All Star....well, at least some stars."}
{"text":"Simply the best restaurant I've ever gone to. What an amazing assortment of flavours for their wings. Also they have their own hot sauce so that's really impressive for a restaurant in the north greater Toronto area.

Their flavour spitting options have gotten worse over years of my patronage but good wings. Roasted Garlic dry is pretty delicious. 

Haven't seen any celebrities here yet but hope to."}
{"text":"as good as it gets (in the GTA)probably the best wings Ive had, ever! granted, i don't necessarily search out for the best wings but Ive tried around 10 other wings places in the  GTA and all-star is hands down the best. Note that this is a review based on flavor and not on service. I always go off peak so its pretty empty when I get there. I'm sure service becomes horrendous past 6pm when the place is getting packed.

my choices:
pandoras box
garlic & pepper - dry rub
nero, ceasar etc seem the same to me"}
{"text":"Love the wings here! A gazillion flavours you can choose from, great customer service as well! I'll make a trip here again"}
{"text":"Meh. All their sauces taste kinda similar, they only have a few base sauces and then toss in a few extras to call it something different. The price is not that great either. The service was really slow. This place is only good for watching sports (TVs everywhere!) and have beers and wings with friends. Don't come here expecting outstanding food."}
{"text":"I love All Star Wings.. I have yet tried all the different flavor after going there since Highschool days.  I keep going back to the same 3-4 flavors that tingle my taste-buds.  Cesar does Texas, Bloody Cesar, God of Thunder, Pandora's box, etc.  just can't get enough of it.  This location used to be in the corner of Eglin Mills and Yonge but has moved to the bigger location down the street. I have been to the new location 3-4 times now.  I still prefer the original location on Woodbine.  This place get packed whenever basketball and hockey game comes on.  Love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Fries here are great too; tried the greek fries, loaded fries and poutine.  They sell Cheesecake factory cheesecake here as well and the portion is fair."}
{"text":"Walked in today looking for a few things:

a) Place to do some work with free wifi

b) a cold beer

c) A decent lunch

Given that I had had good luck here many times in past I figured on a nice Sunday afternoon this would be a good place to get some work done. After being seated the wait time for a drink was abhorrent. I was one of 5 tables seated and I waited a solid 20 minutes for one of the two staff to come back. One server seemed to be doing all the checking around while the other was preoccupied in a corner booth with a grabby fellow I could only assume was her boyfriend.

Finally got my drink order in when the wait for the food order began. Fast forward to 20minutes later and my order was taken. 1lb of wings and a cheese dog (given that it was so good the last time). 

Normal wait time on the food but when it arrived I was sorely disappointed. Here is what I found:

- Wings, were not properly sauced, and extremely patchy. To make matters worse the wings were overcooked to the point of being hard. I left half my wings....
- Cheese dog, much like the wings the hot dog was cooked to a hard brown shell, the bun had been over toasted and was rock hard. 

I'm sure this was an \"off-day\" but rest assured I'll be stopping in for only a beer next time, not food."}
{"text":"I love coming here whether its for their wings or simply to watch a game on TV! Been here many times so I'll just comment based on my different experiences.

This All Star Wings is pretty easy to find as its in the corner inside a plaza. The location however can sometimes be packed and sometimes be quiet. Just go with your luck - I always come here on impulse haha:)

Their wings are really good, come here for 'em! They have over 200 flavours for you to choose from and if you dare, you can try their super hot wings!! (Remember to tell me about it afterwards~).

Personally, I haven't tried too many flavours but I tend to be very loyal towards the \"Blue Honey\" flavour. It's basically honey garlic wings with blue cheese. I actually order this flavour almost at every wings place.

Most of the time, our table of two would order both the Blue Honey and Honey Garlic wings split evenly. Don't judge, just my style lol.

The Honey Garlic wings were quite sticky but super tasty mmmm. As for my Blue Honey, they were more towards the sour side - this actually is my fav! I love sour food hehe, suits my taste buds. Those wings were also very saucy and stuck to my mouth a lot. Seriously, writing about it now makes me want these wings! It was very creamy and plus, the blue cheese ain't too strong for the general audience either. Too delicious to describe anymore! Crispy on the outside, tender and soft on the inside.

The wing sizes at All Star Wings are relatively big too (despite finding an abnormally flat yet huge wing). Nevertheless, both Blue Honey and Honey Garlic are good options for those who don't or can't take spiciness.

Most of the time, their service is good but I still can recall twice that weren't at par.

One time, the server kept us waiting for a whole 30+ minutes for wings when the restaurant was pretty much empty. Turns out one of their stoves or something broke down.

Another time, our server forgot to place in our order of sweet potato fries until we questioned it after 30 minutes. Finally after it was served, I realized they didn't come with the typical mayonnaise mustard dip you usually get. They only had ketchup = fail. It was funny but I was impressed - they attempted to make a chipotle-mayo dip for us as an alternative. Good effort and service even though it still didn't go too well with the sweet potato fries (tasted more like bbq sauce, kind of a weird spicy sour taste) :P

Those are my wing stories! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"- came uptown with a couple of friends in the summer, and decided to hit all stars for some grub
- a straight up sports bar with great wings (definitely try the caesar does texas!!). i wish i could remember all the other flavours we had, but i do recall it all being delicious and satisfying.
- the place isn't huge, and we got lucky in grabbing one of the last tables
- will certainly be back to all stars when i'm in the neighborhood and starving.
- one odd thing about the place is that because of its location... it was rammed with asian folks. i mean, that makes sense because it's in richmond hill and all, but it's eerie to me.... to walk into a wing joint/sports bar, and it's all full of guys who look like me. jokes."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here (3 months apart from the fist time) and both times I woke up with a massive stomach ache and I felt like a needed to vomit. 

Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for their wing special (1.5lbs wings for the price of 1lb wings with the purchase of a drink).

Pros:
- Lots of seating
- Open late
- Lots of TV's
- Parking

Cons:
- Slow service
- The dressing on our wings was just put on top (wasn't even mixed in.
- We were given 1lb of wings instead of 1.5lbs even though we ordered drinks and reminded the waitress.
- They didn't even bring us the drinks we ordered."}
{"text":"More interested in filling tables over servicing customers. Will never step foot in here again. Better to go a little east to Wild Wings where the service is great."}
{"text":"Walk in.....basically all the lights are off or dim. No atmosphere. Greeted by a sever who at first was all smiles, but was far more focused on her booth, paper work and phone. 

Ordered a stale beer, ordered the burger with the crispy chicken on top and took the up sell on the fries. 

Server didn't bother to follow up, until I flagged her down. Advised her that the beer was stale and the fries were over cooked. Did nothing to appease the situation. Mumbled a couple things, and when I asked for the bill promptly cashed me out.

Beauty won't save the world, but a simple showing of understanding can save a bad to mediocre meal. 

Will not go back, and kinda feel stupid for tipping her. The empty seats in a large establishment say so much. 

So glad I didn't order the $25 dollar wings and add fries and a beer."}
{"text":"Hands down the best selection of Wing's in Canada - BOLD 

This joint boasts at any given time nearly 100 different homemade flavours of wings. Unfortunately the wacky names have no descriptions, but that's why you have me. 

Try the following wings which never disappoint, staples in my bi-monthly visit. 

God of Thunder (my fav - heat 5/8) 
Cheesy Where's the Beef? (gravy and cheddar) 
Hot Asian Rancher (speaks for itself) 
Casear does Texas (Caesar sauce and parmesan) 
Montezuma Revenge (fire - heat 6/8) 
Desperado (no idea...only God of Thunder knows) 
Lemon Pepper (dry zesty) 

They rarely if ever have the Armageddons wings anymore. If they do, you must sign a waiver to eat these wings, and you have 30min to eat 11 of these lava rockets sitting at the bar. If you complete this task you get your picture on the Wall of Fame along with a T-shirt and an ulcer. The Armo wings boast scoville units of over 1,000,000. They could call it Pepperspray Lite. I recommend getting past Montezuma Revenge first.

Onion scoops & Greek fries are a sure shot.

{"text":"I am kind of surprised that All Stars has received such positive reviews. Perhaps it is the novelty of the restaurant that makes people enjoy it so much. Personally, All Stars was a very \"meh\" sort of experience, and I prefer Wild Wings in comparison.

Situated in a fairly \"Asian\" plaza, I found that All Stars kind of stuck out like a sore thumb, since the concept of the restaurant is more Westernized than the other places in the plaza. So, the inside of the restaurant is kind of awkward since the design is meant for a more young hip, \"typical bar crowd\" but the customers are actually families, or teenagers who want to say they ate at a wings place. Now that's neither good or bad,  I just wanted to explain my perspective of the restaurant's atmosphere.

A thing that I found very disappointing was the lack of description for the long list of wing flavours. For first time customers they are literally taking a stab in the dark about what type of wings they are REALLY ordering. Course, you can ask the waitress, but honestly if every new customer in the restaurant has to ask about 3-5 different wing flavours they're considering, can you imagine how slow the service would be on a busy day??

When the wings arrived, I noticed that orders were smaller than Wild Wings, while the price is similar too. The wings are also on the small side, but some people enjoy small wings (I prefer just a smidge bigger than that) so those people might enjoy it more. In addition they skimp on the amount of dipping sauce (container isn't even half full) and there is a lack of carrots. I ordered the Caesar in New Mexico Wing, and to be honest the first 2 wings tasted great. Then as I kept eating, the creaminess of the sauces just felt overwhelming after a while, and I started to lean more towards my boyfriend's Texan honey wings. 

Overall the wings were good. You have options that you wouldn't normally get at a typical wing place. But unfortunately I left the place still kind of hungry. I recommend ordering an app or 2, or even dessert, b/c a single will NOT fill you up! ( The equivalent of a single at wild wings DID fill me up). I came into this restaurant with high expectations but was left disappointed by the menu format, and the \"meh\" quality food. I would give it 2.5, but I leaned towards the lower end b/c I had to leave hungry.

NOTE: This might be more enjoyable in a large group, since you can try other people's wings, so more variety. (I think the menu says that's not allowed, but really I doubt they'll say \"stop sharing right now!\")"}
{"text":"Found a piece of hair on my food and told the waitress but she just laughed and kind of apologized and no compensation on the bill. 

Wings were okay but very mildly dressed. Service was so slow and they weren't even busy. Two girls at the front of the store did nothing except chat with one another. 

Ps there is a check in deal on Yelp with this particular location and the woodbine location doesn't have anything."}
{"text":"Great waitresses, enough said......

Go for the Monday specials, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Ever since they moved to the new location 2.5 years ago this place has steadily gone downhill and the price keeps going up. Ordered take out - 50 wings were $55. Pretty expensive. But then got home and realized all of them were little flats. Not ONE drumstick type wing. What a rip off. Took them back and they admitted that they had only flats left. Why didn't they tell me that. Then they said they added more because there's no drumsticks. Lied! Exactly 50. They refunded my money. Left and went to St Louis. Better and cheaper. Too bad because it's a good place to watch a game but the management just doesn't give a s$!t. Fire everyone, start again. 
Stay away."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot in my stomach for All Stars. I have yet to find a comparable wings joint in the YVR, so when I come home for a visit, it's on my list of places to eat at. Having not been back here in two years, I was super excited eyeing the selection on the menu. Like giddy bouncing in my seat excited. My company was embarrassed. 

The place was semi-busy, but our server was nice. There's a ton of TVs in there playing at least two different things so you're never bored. Food came at a good pace, and there was no long waits.

We ordered a pound of the Mardi Gras wings (a 2 on their hot scale), and a pound of the Cajun since I was looking for a dry wing to complement. The Mardi Gras were as good as I remember, with the same signature mustard flavour, but were not anywhere near hot. Like, not even mild. Weird, I know. The cajun completely fell off the wagon. It's a metaphorical wagon, filled with wings that were headed to the cajun spicing party. And this pound just decided \"no, I don't want to go to the party\". They tasted like wings. Plain wings. It was a bit sad, scraping the little things along the containers so that they could be mildly seasoned.

Overall, it lives up to the tough pedestal I put in my head on the place. I came here for the Mardis Gras, and they didn't disappoint. I know that their other flavours are just as good, since I've tried a few others but it was a while back. But with so many to choose from, it'll require several visits back. Slow and steady!"}
{"text":"When it comes to wings I recommend all stars!
They have hundred of wing flavours to choose from, they literally have something for everyone.

They also have a lot of other great menu items,
One of my favs is the thunder burger, chicken, beef pattie and bacon!! 

I usually get the wings I try to mix it up every time I go. 
My current favourite is pucker up baby 
Lemon pepper seasoning, garlic powered and hot sauce. I love the lemon taste in it its so good.
Pandora's box is also another really good one and of course is their famous ceaser does Texas which is pretty popular especially if you really can't decide.

The place has a lots of tv and one at every booth which makes it perfect to watch whatever game is on. 
 Also For birthdays they give you a cupcake and a candle."}
{"text":"Had a couple of wings and a burger at this place and I was violently ill all night. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Location
This plaza was moderately busy before TnT (supermarket) came around but now it's a circus lol. Luckily, most of us eat wings at night and that is when the families are out of the grocery stores and in their homes/restaurants eating dinner. There are plenty of parking spots at night time so you don't have to worry but the intersection at Woodbine and 16th Ave is always full of traffic. If I were you, I would go westward on 16th so I can turn right into the plaza or North on Woodbine so I can turn right again after the Tim Hortons entrance. Obviously there are other ways to get into the plaza as well.

Service
I was actually quite impressed with the service here or should I say eye candy lol. Everyone looks great here and that includes both waiters and waitresses. This is an added bonus by the way, everyone is really nice! Service was a little slow and I'm not sure if it's because they were understaffed or that they walked at snail speed lols. Anyhow, I didn't think it mattered too much because they were very accommodating (our party did not arrive on time).

Food
For appetizers we ordered the Fresh Fries with Gravy which is JUST AWESOME. I felt so fat after that and its portion is great for sharing among 4-5 individuals. In terms of chicken wings, the best or most popular flavour is the Cleopatra. Like the name dictates, it is unique lols. Covered with a white (ranch?) sauce, you immediately taste the garlic during the first bite but later on it tastes a little sour, sweet, and then it calms down into a meaty flavour. I have no idea how to describe the Cleopatra except it looks extremely greasy but GOOD. We ordered Hawaiian Honey which was more sauce than taste; I'd go back to honey garlic. The last flavour was Lemon Pepper (dry) and I did not like it. The combination of lemon and pepper just didn't sit well in my stomach so it was not my wing favourite. One of my friends really like celery so we ordered extra. For those who don't know one bowl of freshly cut celery sticks is only $1, totally worth it.

Impression: Average wings place."}
{"text":"3.5 + 0.5 for great wings

Came to catch up with a friend, and its always nice to share some wings over conversation!

Pretty quiet when we got there, but the place seemed to pick up a bit afterwards. We got seated pretty quickly, just that they had to clean a table for us.

Atmosphere is definitely more bar-like than restaurant, as it was a little darker than I would have liked. 

We decided to share 30 wings between 2 people and didn't finish them all, so we ended up taking about 6-7 home. Got 'Pandora's Box' as it was one that I liked before, but had some difficulty choosing from their extremely large selection. Very good wings, excellent sauce and flavour. Would have been nice to get some more celery to balance the palate, but you 'are' there for the wings! 

Overall good service, but did have to wait and wave down the waitress to either get another glass of water or the bill."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of all star wings but this location always has terrible service. I'm a huge fan of the pizza flavored wings or cheesy wheres the beef. The quality of the wings are decent and the beef ribs are pretty good. The service is so poor here you can just drive to the one in Markham."}
{"text":"Been craving chicken wings all week and the advantage of house-sitting up north is the easy access to All Star Wings. With the ample variety in selection, I finally settled for Chinatown after initially selecting Shanghai surprise. 

All Stars did not disappoint. 

This sports bar's wings will have any choice your palette is calling for. The only flaw is, the waitress will probably need to explain the flavour as there are no descriptions on the menu beside their catchy names. 

Ambiance is as standard as a sports bar can be, but is a little on the narrow side with not enough televisions for me to watch the basketball highlights. 

Well deserving of their restaurant name - equipped with an all star wing line up indeed.

Mission accomplished... my wing crave now satisfied, but also I'm left craving for more!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday with my little cousin. This is one of my favorite places to get wings.  Lots of TV's so it usually gets packed during big sports events as this is one of their smaller locations compared to the Richmond Hill and Vaughan locations.

We were there at about 4:45 pm so it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by our waitress Michelle. We ordered two flavors, All Thai'd Up and Neuro's Epilogue both non-breaded. She informed us that we could get the Monday special which was 1.5 pounds of wings for the price of 1 pound with a purchase of a beverage if we waited till 5pm for her to input the order. Thumbs up to Michelle for informing us.  We also ordered 2 iced teas ($2.95 each, bottomless).

All Thai'd Up ($10.95): sweet thai chili with creamy dill - This is my all-time favorite flavor since it's sweet and creamy.  I absolutely recommend this flavor.

Nero's Epilogue ($10.95) Frank's hot sauce, caesar dressing and parmesan cheese.

Both order of wings came with some celery sticks on the side with your choice of dipping sauce which includes, ranch, blue cheese and creamy dill.  The sizes of the wings were of good size as they were quite meaty.  Wings were saucy and fried very nicely as the wings were juicy.

Bill came up to about $35, tax and tips included.  Pretty good since we got about 3 pounds of wings and 2 drinks.  The Monday Special is definitely worth it since if you were to get 3 pounds of wings it would be $29.95 + tax & tip, and you would only be able to pick 1 flavor."}
{"text":"Called in advance to see if it was busy since the soccer game was on, and we didn't want to wait. Server said it wasn't busy, so we went. The server we got was 'Sally' and I think she just decided to take her break throughout the whole time we were there. To even get seated, we had to wait about 5 mins with a bunch of empty tables available. We got to see a glimpse through the swinging back door and she was on her phone. Not a good start.

Once we finally got seated, it probably took another 20mins for her to get back to us and take our order. Side note: the one star I'm rating this was how quickly the food came. Once we finished our meal, it took another 20 mins to get her to come back to cash us out. I mean come on now, game was over and there were maybe 5 customers in there in total. By the way, if you're into wing deals like we are, she didn't honour it on our bill!

Perhaps it was just her and her bad service, but I think it's enough for me to decide that I would probably never come back to this location. Stick to the Vaughan location if you're planning on visiting All Stars!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of All Stars. Usually get gar par wings and grilled cheese sandwiches. The food at this location is very underwhelming. The All Stars at McCowan is a lot better in terms of the dine in/ bar experience and take out. The wings were made very poorly/lazily and the fries we got were cold and soggy. Not getting food from this location again."}
{"text":"Whatever people say about the other wings places, I don't care, because All Star (all locations) has the best wings. Their insanely long list of flavours gives you so many endless options you won't know what to choose. I am a lover of spice and I love that there are so many spicy flavours I can keep trying. 

It's a sports bar so it does get very very rowdy. There's also a TV at every booth and you can request to change it to whatever you want to watch. 

One of my favourite wings places!"}
{"text":"!!!! Very bad experience!!!!
This is my first time I write a review but the bad experience I had pushed me to do so. 
This all star location is the worst experience I ever had. 
The restaurant is not clean at all, full of flys, the washroom is uncleaned and no soap. 
We went in Monday and we suppose to get pound and half for the price of one pound and we didn't. 
The soft drink was flat and when we asked why, they answered, that's what we have. 
Over all, service, food and the cleanness of the place was really bad!! 
Sorry about this review but I had to do it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came by for a quick bite, the waitress was on her own so it took her a bit of time to greet us which is no problem. Unfortunately it was last call but I've been to several locations so I was already set on what I was going to order. I did the classic Caesar does Texas and my friend had the Killer Bee. Points to the server for letting us know about the Monday promo for 1.5lb for the price of 1lb. Here's where it got a little bad, when we got our order, the serving size was pathetic and mind you this was with the promo size and like literally two twigs of celery. Flavor was right but this locations wings are the smallest I've seen compared to the one on Yonge or near Wonderland. Waitress topped off our drink here and there but when it came to us almost finishing and having one wing left, she cleared everything including on the table including the plate I was eating with, except I didn't finish eating and still had a wing left in my hand with nowhere left to put the bone. Bill was dropped with nothing else offered. Quick to kick us out, quick for us not to return. Quite unfortunate that you guys are almost as disappointing as the dirty location near Scarborough Town Centre."}
{"text":"Great service! Came here on a monday night and it was pretty quiet. Grabbed a drink with a friend and it was nice and cozy."}
{"text":"This place was THE place to go for wings 2 years ago. Fantastic combination of flavours, melt in your mouth sauces and decent sized wings.  

Sadly, nowadays you'd be better off going to St. Louie's for the same quality of wings (yeah.. ouch).  

As with all wings places with a redonk amount of flavours, they're really hit or miss - and when they miss it tastes like dirt.  

Flavours worth getting:
Nero's Epilogue - when they parm the hell out of it
Ephestius - make sure it's crispy and spicy
Ceaser does Jamaica  - creamier the better
My Ranch is on Fire - same as above"}
{"text":"My go to wings place in the area! Only had their wings and fries. Tons of flavours to try; from classic flavours such as honey garlic and bbq to their own flavours. Usually order different flavours to try but Cleopatra and the All Stars Ranch is a favourite of mine. Waitresses are knowledgeable about the wings flavour since there are no descriptions on the menu. We always order fries on the side, the Greek fries and hail Caesar are a good twist if you don't want to order just plain fries. 
It's usually packed on game nights so reserve if you're planning to watch the games"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the AllStar Nachos and it hit the spot in terms of my craving.  These were freshly prepared nacho chips topped with 1/2 lb. of cheese, diced tomato, jalape√±os, and shallots.  It was served with salsa and sour cream.  (For four dollars, we also added a serving of 100% ground beef chili to it.)  The cheese was so good -- chewy and stringy while the jalape√±os were just spicy to give a kick.  We devoured this and despite its gigantic size, finished it with just three pieces left.  It was truly comfort food at its best.

The Pineapple Curry wings smelled of pineapple and curry for sure.  The Maple Thai wings tasted very similar to honey garlic wings.  The wings came with a few stalks of celery and ranch dip.  The wings were all right; I thought they were a tiny tad on the dry side.

The service here was good.  Even though it was just that one server manning the entire dining room floor, she came by often enough to check on us and was attentive to any requests we had."}
{"text":"Disappointing.....  wings taste good but I've never had SMALLER wings anywhere EVER
Been here many times. But tonight was ridiculous.  Wings should be bigger than your pinky finger. No????  I told the waitress. She didn't seemed too fussed even though it's not her fault. 
Not sure if I'd go back. 
Still can't get over how small these wings are. Where's the beef???!  Or chicken in this case."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wed evening around 930pm to a half full restaurant. Was greeted and seated promptly. Our server was great all around. The wings were alright...rather small portions, nothing special really. We seriously questioned if the 2 Ceasar's & Rye/Coke had any alcohol in them. The Ceasar's Salad was really good however, lol. 

Go figure...the best thing at this wing joint was the Salad lmao."}
{"text":"3 stars is a bit of a stretch, but I'll round up. I was there on a Saturday night with some friends. It wasn't very busy at all, yet the service was pretty slow.

Food:
We went for the wings - and they were good. They have a large variety to choose from which is great, but can get overwhelming. The way the pounds are priced is a bit annoying. Why complicate things?
Also ordered the jalapeno poppers and $10 fries, which was OK. Borderline gross with the salty gravy and overcooked burger patty. But hey! we expected that.

Service: 
The servers are really nice. So lovely!
But I don't know if it's the lack of training, they seemed to be very confused. She told us the special (bucket of beer + $4 off 2 pounds of one flavor wings). We didn't care for the discount because we wanted to share... told her not to worry, and ordered some wings and a bucket of beers (Sol). She comes back with a bucket of Coors Light (all open) because \"Oh Coors Light is on special, not Sol!\". We usually wouldn't care,  but 1) None of us like Coors Light!  2) Why would you open 5 beers without asking if we were okay with it? We clearly asked for something completely different. 
I know she was trying to go above and beyond, but seemed a little too insistent on giving us the \"special\" which really wasn't anything amazing. 

I'll go back. They have decent wings (different from most) and it's fairly inexpensive. Service... confusing."}
{"text":"The service was really bad and slow. We went at 10, there were 3 tables and 3 waitresses and the staff was still slow , apparently the 10%- is only for one person at the table because we didn't tell her before ( ya ok ) and the bathrooms were sooooo disgusting I can't even imagine the kitchen. Flies everywhere. Each toilet was flooding and so much water on the floor. The pipes would just spuew out water , smelt like mold. Lipstick writing on the walls. 

The wings were good ... that's about it. The one in Vaughan was much better. I wouldn't come back to this location. And pop $3.50

Ya they have crazy flavours but who really knows what \" lover say yes \" or \" mama Mia  \" and all these random flavours are ??"}
{"text":"All Star Wings has recently moved to a bigger location at 10520 Yonge Street.  The decor is now less tacky, and the wings... delicious as usual!

I was always one of the \"boys\" in my crowd of high school friends, so whenever we get together, Wings and playing Halo until the wee hours of the morning are always in tow.  

Of all the places for wings, I would say that All Star offers the most decently-sized wings.  OPA is by far my favourite flavour... can't get enough of that feta cheese.. and the herb mixture they use in there, whatever it is... I'm sure even Zeus would agree that it is marvelous!  

Other great flavours are: 
Caesar does Texas
Black Widow
Wings Gone Wild
Wet & Wild

I've also gotten their Greek Salad (which, is enough to feed 2 people, it is massive!)  

A great hang out place if you don't mind getting down and dirty... with your hands that is!"}

hmmm wings yyam :-)

for those w/out a car u can take viva bus up there its pretty quick"}
{"text":"I've been here many times with family and friends on a hunt to try all their wing flavors. Other than wings I've only had their Cajun shrimp and Greek garlic bread, which are both pretty good!

Flavors I've had:
1. Honey jerk: 6/10. Didn't like this much 
2. Pandora's box: 7/10. This was basically honey garlic to me. It was ok, not my favorite. I am not a big fan of honey garlic. 
3. Bloody caesar: 8/10. This is one of my favorite flavors. 
4. Caesar does Texas: 9/10. This is my go to flavor. It's very creamy and delicious. I always get this along with another random one to share because I know I will enjoy this. 
5. Piza piza: 7.5/10. This is one of the better ok flavors. 
6. Greek Texan: 8/10. This is another one of my favorites. 
7. Cleopatra: 7/10. Just ok
8. Mexican ranchero: 8.5/10. This was delicious. Along with the other two Caesar flavors, this is one of my favorites."}

They have your usual basic flavors and others with cryptic names. Your order of wings comes with celery and carrots (you know, because veggies are good for your health!!)."}
{"text":"This review is based off a quality check in the kitchen and how things were handled afterwards. 

Came in on a Friday night,  was greeted and seated quickly. Our server wasn't very personable. Just there to take the order and leave. I ordered the burger that came with the fried chicken breast on a pretzel bun. 

The burger came out and there was mold on the bun. 
As the server wasn't very attentive. I finally waved her down and showed her. She took it back and another lady brought me the same burger on a different type of bun. Who knows about any cross contamination that went down with the cooks in the back. 

Our server brought our bill and didn't even try to acknowledge the mess that was created. I had to flag her down again and she then said \"oh I'll ask my manager\". I think it's weird that I had to ask about this. 
As someone who was  a server in the past I would have been incredibly apologetic and definitely would have found a way to make things right. In the end I got 25% off my bill. Which is fine. 

The food itself was good. The burger was a little salty and the fries were a little soggy for my liking. Overall for food 2.5/5 stars. Beer selection was quite good."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight, it wasn't busy at all. Got seated and waited 20 minutes and the server hadn't even come to the table. There were two hostess's  having a conversation amongst themselves, who's attention we could not get. No servers in sight, so we got up and left. Never again! Such a waste of my time! I would hate to see what happens on a busy night. Wait.. Maybe they don't have busy nights.."}
{"text":"There are 4 things you must have to run a successful sports bar/wing joint, you need good food, hot waitresses, cold beer and lots of TV's and this place hits on all points. When I need a chicken wing fix this is the place I head to, with over 100 flavours they will have something for everybody. Their wings are quite plump, lightly breaded and fried to crisp perfection, while remaining nice and juicy on the inside. Some of my favourite flavours include \"Wings Gone Wicked\" (Creole mustard and hot sauce), \"Pandora's Bomb\" (Sweet chilli Thai and hot sauce) and \"Caesar Does Texas\" (Chipotle and Caesar/parmesan). For those who like their wings more simple this place also has your basic honey garlic, mild, medium and hot but it would be a sin to go here and not experiment a little. The fries here are very thick and quite good also. They have other things like burgers on the menu but I have never tried them. 

This place is huge (located in an old East Side Mario's), there are big screen TV's everywhere and even TV's in every booth. The servers are not just there for their looks, they are actually quite friendly (but guys seriously if you take your girlfriend here you better be good at sneaking quick peeks otherwise be ready for a fight). The menu doesn't have descriptions of the flavours so don't be afraid to ask your server about them or for suggestions, in my experience they are always happy to help. The beer selection leaves a lot to be desires as they only have your basic Molson beers and nothing from a small local brewery. This place draws in an eclectic crowd, everything from families enjoying dinner together to guys coming out to watch the game, this place is always buzzing! Overall it is one of my favourite places in the area and hands down my favourite place to get wings in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"It does get pretty busy during the evenings but so far, I haven't had any problems with service. Their breaded wings are really flavourful and crispy. My personal favourites are ranch and bloody caesar (caesar + hot sauce). It's true that they don't list any of the ingredients beside the names, but I have always been able to ask the servers for explanations and recommendations. Surprisingly, they also have a good salad selection and I always order the California salad (spinach, brie, cherry tomatoes, pecans, etc.) I don't go for wings often, but this is the place I go to when I do get that craving. It's a nice casual atmosphere with good food at a decent price.

(6/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"This place used to be incredible. But it has really gone down hill. In the past 2 years the wings have gotten smaller, they give you less (about 7 for a single order, and sometimes 1 or 2 aren't even wings, compared to 10 before),abd they raised the prices. Also the service is pretty terrible sometimes like you'd order a beer, they won't bring it, you ask again, they still don't bring it, than they charge you for it. You're better off taking a 15 min drive to the one at Vaughan Mills the service is much better. You actually get a a full 10 and sometime more single order. Also the food quality is a lot better."}
{"text":"Since they changed management this place are much better. Specially the service. Waitress are not and very nice. The food are the same. For a bar is more enjoyable to drink with friends"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're visiting Richmond hill area you must stop by here. They have hundreds of flavors of wings with a variety of different styles for whatever you're in to. The menu features a scale for \"hotness\" to help you decide which flavors are right for you. They come sweet, mild, spicy, and extremely hot! Perfect for big groups who like variety when it comes to flavors.

Service was great, the place has TV's everywhere you look, and the prices are decent. Great place to catch a ball game with friends"}
{"text":"I still think that ALL STAR has the best flavoured wings, I love the unbreaded wings, but the breaded is very good also, the wings are pretty big and meaty. so many flavours to choose from, you can't really go wrong, there must be something you like? also the Loaded fries is a must (which cut fries loaded with cheese, gravy and bacon) the waitress here are really nice and knows the flavours very well.

Some flavours I like...
honey garlic
mardi gras
ceaser does Texas
wings gone wild
wings gone wilder
nero's epilogue
prime time
hot Hawaiian honey"}
{"text":"Best Wings I've had! I've tried many wings places and nothing else compares. They don't skimp on the sauces! it's loaded with sauces! Yum. There's 100's of flavours to choose from, you wont get sick of it, Even tho after many hit/misses I've already have a set of favourites.

Come with in larger groups or with a few friends, you can get more flavours and there is always someone to finish the left overs. You may think you can stuff 20 wings, with loadded fries, but it's not that easy cause these wings are huge!

and the LOADED fries is a MUST get! the fries are nice and chunchy on the outside with a soft hot center and lots of gravy, mealty stringy cheese and bacon! yum! I might like it even more than the wings itself!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's been that long since I've been back to Markham branch.
No longer the divey landscape it once was and I do miss it.
Back when the scene make for a super casual Wings Night.
This current decor is in-line with their other branches now.

If you didn't know, I do personally like their Wings.
Especially when the moment it hits the table.
Their consistency of the Breaded is nicely crunchy outside.
Depending on Sauce, it'll breakdown the crunchiness at different pace.

Not as juicey as I like at this Wings place or any other.
I haven't found juicey juicey Wings yet outside of HK Cafes.
Even if freshly made, KFC Hot Wings can be amazingly juicey.

Sauces are another story and on more occasions they give more than less.
Like Salad, you can always add more Dressing but you can't take away.
But this ain't Salad now is it?  I just FLING the extra sauce until it's to my liking.

Have you FLING your WING yet?

{"text":"If you've read my review of All Star Vaughan location, then you will know I designate this place as a Sports Bar.  In comparison to the Markham spot, this place actually has private Television at the BOOTHS but not as new as the ones at Vaughan.  

This is definitely an ADVANTAGE as you do not have to TILT your head constantly to properly angle your vision towards both your friend and the Television.  If you don't make an effort to tilt your head at Markham location, your friends will know 100% you didn't hear a thing they said while you watch the RED WINGS win!

The Wings are just as good as ever, but once again STICK with Wings and you'll be a happy customer moving up the ranks to your way to becoming an All Star.

More waitress than the Markham place but on PAR with the Vaughan spot.  Cuteness level I still give to the Vaughan location as I believe the other two places always keep their waitress too busy to be HAPPY or at least have time to ENJOY their work experience.  Poor Girls :-(

Parking can sometimes be difficult as the lot is actually small and the parking setup/dividers are actually at a SLIGHT angle so if you're not a great driver in tight spaces, please drive SAFELY!"}
{"text":"When it comes to wings, All Star Wings is unfortunately not one of my top choices. Coming here on a weekday night, it was packed. Even though it was packed, it took the waitresses 20 minutes before we were served and asked us how many people were in our party. It was a little disappointing that we weren't even acknowledged until later.

The wings itself was decent (I got the Honey Garlic as usual) and each pound of wings is about $11 plus tax. The wings came with about 5 sticks of celery+carrots, which was also a little disappointing. I felt like I'd rather not have such a small amount of celery + carrots, or if they served it, a quantity of around 10 would be better.

Other than that, we were served great when we got to sit down, and the waitress was really accommodating with splitting the bill from such a large party of guests."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Our server Mary is the best!! Amazing wings! If you are in the mood for chicken wings, All Star Wings is the place to be"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get wings! This location and the Vaughan location is always busy, but I can definitely see why. Avoid coming in large groups if there's a game going on because you will definitely have to wait to be seated. I've never had a problem with service and the food is amazing. It's definitely a bit more pricey than other sports bars, but the portions are generous.

On Mondays you get 1.5 pounds for the price of 1 pound of wings with the purchase of a drink. Hint: if you don't want a drink/pop at that moment, order a sealed bottle of iced tea or something and just drink the iced tea later at home. The variety of flavours is insane! There has to be almost 200 or more different flavours. My personal favourite is the Cleopatra (honey garlic and parmesan). Unfortunately, they don't include a description with each flavour so you'll have to rely on your server's opinion.

Since fries aren't included in each pound of wings, I highly recommend ordering their greek fries and pay extra to get them battered. I would purchase take-out of just those fries!"}
{"text":"Our group had 10 lbs of wings.  We were there early Sunday evening and the place was relatively quiet.  Wings were ok, sauces  were plain in taste, overall just ok."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. A million flavours. Speedy service. 

This place is always crazy busy, so expect to wait, especially when there's a game on. I live 15-20 minutes south of here, and still sometimes venture to Richmond Hill for some take out.

Top 5 flavours:

1) Bloody Caeser
2) Hot Blonde 
3) Me Love You Long Time
4) Cheesy Where's the Beef
5) Raptor

YUM!"}
{"text":"Would give a higher rating if the quality and sizes of their wings were more consistent. We love ordering from here since is close by and the huge variety of sauces they have(sweet tooth rancher, and marti gras are our kid friendly favs) but there have been occasions when the wings were over cooked or were very very tiny.  Will probably still order when we need a fix, but hopefully they will recognize that people are noticing and will aim to improve."}
{"text":"So I find myself on a random adventure to Markham. While this may not seem very exciting in itself, my friend suggests we go get wings, and mentions \"All Stars\" as our destination. My excitement increases. Being a food lover I'd heard the name before in wings discussions but didn't really know much else going in. 

Upon arrival, my heart kind of sank. We're in a strip mall parking lot. A strip mall, void of any soul or heritage and filled for the most part with other businesses that I wouldn't ever give a second look. Being as infamous as the name \"All Stars Wings\" is in food circles, I was concerned. How can a place that is in a freaking strip mall be this good? I continued into the place, and once looking at menus I realized that this was one of a few locations which made things make a bit more sense and I was able to lower my guard.

So then we begin to look at the menu. 150 flavours with a good number of them really having no connection between names and potential flavours without someone explaining it to you. We asked for a bit of help from the server who while not being able to make \"recommendations\" but would \"tell us what customer favourites are\", helped us settle on 3 different flavours of varying heat.

We opted for:
-Honey BBQ (no spice, with honey and bbq sauces mixed for flavour)
-Medium (medium spice, your staple chicken wing)
-Casear Goes To Texas (hot spice - with Casear dressing and parmesan cheese sprinkled on it)

All were fantastic, but it was actually the Medium flavoured that were the most bland and boring so it goes to show you should step outside the box when the options are there. The wings were big an meaty, nicely breaded and really saucey, just the way I like 'em.

50 wings and 1 pitcher of Creemore Springs came to $68 after tax before tip.

Would it be helpful to have better descriptions on their menu? For sure. But are the wings top notch and redeeming even to the thought of going to Markham? Definitely. Perhaps if I ever venture to Richmond Hill or Vaughn I'll go check out the other locations. In the mean time, I need to find some wings of this quality in the downtown core.

I saw someones review on here comparing these to Wild Wing, and I can say I left a whole lot more satisfied from here than I did Wild Wing. All Stars wings seemed bigger and more saucey. I loves me some sauce and All Stars applied liberally which gets it bonus points in my books. Not to mention Wild Wing feels more \"corporate\", so take that as you will."}
{"text":"Service is pathetic.  I've only had to get up four times to ask for something.  Asked for well done wings and wings were barely warm when I received them."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. It is my husband's favourite (he is huge into wings). If I had reviewed this years ago, believe me, I would not have given it this high of a rating.  It was initially a corporate store, then went to franchise, and is now back to a corporate location.  The food used to be just OK and inconsistent (sometimes it was good, other times, awful).  I think corporate is key  --- the menu and food is consistent and you know what you're getting.

As a result, I have developed a love for wings.  The menu here is actually quite large, but everything I've tried has been really good.  This is not diet food, people.  This is PMS food on steroids.  

First, the wings.  The wings come in a thousand flavours but the staff is so patient and helpful.  They have no problem walking you through the flavours and making suggestions.  The wings are never undercooked (a big pet peeve of mine, and a reason why I rarely order wings at other restaurants).  I always go with unbreaded and sauced.  They are lighter and more \"done\".  

Favourite flavours are: Homicide (which is essentially Buffalo Hot, but at a spice level I prefer), Neros Epilogue (hot sauce and caesar - sounds disgusting, but so good).  My husband loves Prime Time (Chipotle, hot sauce and ranch -- also sounds disgusting, but tasty and SO hot).  

The fries are really good.  Fresh cut and perfectly cooked, light on the salt (which I prefer).  YOU MUST GET THE TZATZIKI to dip. It is apparently exclusive to All Stars, and it is to.die.for. 

I also really like the onion chips with dill sauce and the Alexander salad (to cut the grease, haha).  

Service is great.  Lots of TVs.  The pleather on the booths could use repair, but otherwise the place is clean and comfortable.  Good kid options too (my son loves the Nathan's hot dogs).   They also have a huge grilled cheese menu, if you're into that."}
{"text":"No reservations allowed for a Friday night. Here to watch game 4 of the 2017 NBA finals. 

Ordered the following as recommended by our food server :

Pandora's box - sweet/mild spicy honey flavour - 10/10

Dry roasted garlic and pepper - no sauce but with a great tasting garlic flavour all around - 10/10

Smoking Texas - sweet/more spicy with the Homicide (hot sauce) - so this is much spicier and may not appeal to you if you prefer mild spiciness. I'm ok with it but it had less of the aroma of the other two.  7/10

NY striploin 8 oz - my youngest son is into steaks now after trying out different striploins. Although he liked it, it was not as good as Baton Rouge's. This one from All Star tasted a bit bland for me and the striploin that came out appeared to be lukewarm. The mash potatoes that came with it were very good. 6/10. 

I'd say the wings are great but skip the striploin."}
{"text":"A fan of All Star Wings, however this location is my least favorite and one I will never go to again. Especially at the last time I went which was around 10:45pm and they said last calls were already passed and they don't serve any more food when clearly the hours of operation were late. Wings here are small also."}
{"text":"We ordered bear and our glasses had lipstick mark on them. My son ordered coke and it tasted like bleach, their coke machine was not working ok. The service was very mediocre. We ordered 4 different wings and all were cold. Very disappointed. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"When it comes to wings places in Markham area, I think most people will mention All Star Wings & Ribs at some point in time.  This is a Wings & Ribs place but I actually never had their ribs before.

This wing place offers a wide variety of flavours for their wings, and if you ask me to choose a top 3, I will go for the breaded wings with Hail Caesar,  Cajun and Honey Garlic.  Yes, as you can already guessed, I can't eat things that are too spicy.

As for sides, I highly recommend the Fully Loaded Fries, aka the bacon with everything poutine!  And if you are like me where you always have a few health conscious friends where they like to order foods other than beer, wings and fries in a WINGS place, the salads they offer here are actually quite decent in size and they taste great as well!

Lastly, the beer! They do have a decent selections to choose from, so I'm sure you will find a drink you want!

Want a place to watch some games or hang out with friends, this place will be a great option!"}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get our bill, food took way too long and boneless wings came hard ?

The place is run by waitresses that I can honestly say don't care for the people"}
{"text":"The wings were at most \"okay\", had much much tastier wings at All Star location near Vaughan Mills mall. The service was rushed.

The place itself is dated and dirty (considering it's only around 5 years old), there were many flies flying around inside. The bathroom smelled horrible and was also very dirty (can tell nobody cares about standards there) 

Will not return to this location, other locations keep a much higher food, service and cleanliness level."}
{"text":"Two issues:
First- the place is not clean at all. Starting with fingerprints and dirty windows when I walked in. Sticky tables. Uncomfortable seats.  Chicken wings served in dirty baskets. 

Second - the chicken wings are so small they are barely worth eating. Guessing that in my pound of wings 2/3 was bone

Won't go back!"}
{"text":"Good typical American food. The prices aren't that bad either. My only major complaint is how outdated the place is.. the chairs are all ripping apart and it just seems dark and dingy. Oh and one last thing, the service is terrible. They server will stay as far away as possible I feel like lol."}
{"text":"Great crowd? Good wings? Hot waitresses? Ding ding* 

What draws customers to come back again is not only because the wings are good, but because of the plethora of flavours to keep trying out. Though, it would have been nice to have descriptions under the flavours to better navigate your choices. Sometimes, I feel swarmed and confused of what to choose from, based on names alone.

So some flavours have been a hit or miss for me.

Personal favourite:
Honey Garlic
Wings Gone Wild
Pandora's Box

Wings are cooked well and tossed in the right amount of sauce. 

Note: Restaurant has gone under renovations a year back, and it is MUCH more spacious. Be warned that it gets quite crowded on Friday and weekends."}
{"text":"They have so many different kinds of wings, you might as well make it a game to pick a random one. 

Coming in with completely random names like Babe Ruth to Armageddon, they are categorized in level of spiciness (I believe there are at least 10 different levels).

They have the most interesting varieties of wings that you will most likely never ever see anywhere else and I've yet to have one that hasn't been amazingly good.

Ribs are very good as well but go for the wings. Also don't forget to try the special fries (forget the name but are loaded with toppings and sauces) as they are mouthwateringly and heart-stoppingly amazing."}
{"text":"I used to work right above the old Richmond Hill location at Yonge and Elgin Mills. So the girls and I regularly ordered lunch from here, just cuz it was e-z and we got a discount :) 

The new location in the No Frills plaza is WAY better, bigger and with a patio (something the old location seriously lacked). 

I have a problem with the wing selection...there are too many choices. I have food ADD as it is, with this many wing choices I'm basically on the verge of a seizure. Another (real) issue is that you don't really know what the wings are unless you ask, the funky names don't give much away. I liked Caesar Does Texas (chipotle and Caesar), Mardi Gras (creole honey mustard I think?) and Green Texan (it has the same Greek dressing the Greek Fries do, yummy and creamy. DO NOT hesitate to ask about flavours - they know everything. You can just say the flavour you are looking for and they will point out the wings for you.

I think the wings here are much smaller than they are at other place - for example Puck n Wings has a less flavours but the wings are meatier, same with Wild Wing.

Another thing I love are the fries - again the Greek Fries are DELICIOSO and so is the \"poutine\" (they call it fries with cheese and gravy on the menu).

I heard the burgers were delicious from a lot of people so next time I go, instead of freaking out over which wings I want I'll try the burger!

The girls that work here are hella cute, love the outfits!!! 

Lots of TVs but this place get super packed during big games so I try to avoid it unless I can come in to reserve a spot like 2 hours before the game. 

I tried to lick an H-Bomb wing once before and almost died. I don't recommend it...it's not good for your stomach, seriously, it's cool to show off to your friends that you can eat the spiciest wings but a) chances are you won't finish them and will end up wasting food and b) it's asking for upset stomach. If you're Abbas then disregard this warning."}
{"text":"An amazing wing place. Used to come here all the time with friends, and would split 100 wings between 5 of us or so.
Ive never had a problem here, and their wings are so saucy and tasty.
Honestly the best wings I've had in all of Ontario.

If you had to choose this or wild wings, definitely go with All Stars. wild wings doesn't compare at all."}
{"text":"Absolute best place to get wings. The wings are fairly huge and come in a variety of different flavours. The only downfall is that there is no description of what your ordering but thats not a problem all you have to do is ask any of the sweet waitresses. Lets just say this is a definete guy place in that the waitresses are amazing. The value for the wings are fairly decent, when me and my 5 friends go we always order 100 wings and it costs us $50 not including drinks. If you ever have a craving for wings I would definetly recommend this place for I always go once a month.

Items to definetely order:

Appetizer
-parma fries 

WINGS (in order of favourites)
-nero epilogue (hot sauce, ceasar dressing, cheese)
-cleopatra (honey, mild sauce, cheese, ceasar dressing)
-caesar does texas (ceasar dressing, medium sauce)
-god of thunder 
-all thai up"}
{"text":"The location is rubbish to be honest. It's in a corner that I couldn't see for a good 15 minutes. Don't go there if you're with a big group of friends. The place is tiny. The waitress was a bit too slow even though the restaurant was empty. She also messed up my receipt. I gave it four stars however because of the food. I ordered the single portion of Bloody Caesar wings and it was absolutely delicious! Would go back there but definitely another branch."}
{"text":"Nice place I came here to grab some wings.. The wings are good for sure.. They have so many flavors you will get lost when u look at the menu.. The server herself did not know much about the flavors she had to pull a small book to look at what each flab stand for.. Over all the place is not bad.. I have been coming here once in a while and it is a definite place to check out.. The servers are usually hit and the bar is full of tv screens for each table so you can enjoy the game playing. The tv does not have much channeled. So you kind of stuck with one channel or two to watch."}
{"text":"This All Star Wings & Ribs is located near Yonge and Elgin Mills. From the outside, I'd say it hasn't been renovated in a while, the menus are quite old as well. There's plenty of parking and the staff are very nice.

The d√©cor isn't bad and there's a monitor at every table in the dining area. The Greek fries are AMAZING and the cheesy with garlic bread for apps! Wow, that sauce on the fries are to die for.

The girl waiting on our table kept making sure we were fine and I appreciated it because she wasn't coming TOO OFTEN but not too little either. Had a couple of beers and ultimately enjoyed the experience here. The only thing I'd recommend the restaurant doing is renovating a little or getting new menus at least... the menus are all old and beat up, which isn't a great first impression when being seated.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Great location in Richmond Hill on a game night with beer and wings. Best of everything is the individual TV for each booth, which is totally AWESOME so that you don't need to keep heads up on wall mounted TVs while shovelling food into your mouth. Service is nice and friendly, food arrived on time despite busy Friday night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was contemplating on how many stars i should give.  The server was great, high pitched voice but very pleasant and friendly. All the hostess there seemed like they were walking-dead. Wings were decent. Nothing to write about. Greek fries were good. Menus looked like they have been abused for over a decade. Place has not been maintained. It's definitely going downhill. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"We had a disappointed experience tonight! Wings were okay but was over priced for what you get. Also service was poor. Server was not available on a quiet night and food was not quick."}
{"text":"For a wing place they serve a decent burger.
So many sauces to choose but the heat ratings don't seem to be very accurate.  Enjoyed the God of thunder sauce last time in.

Went back for lunch today (7/25/14).  Waited 40+ minutes for our food.  Seemed like maybe the cook was late as no one received food for quite a while and then all at once.

That added to the bland burger I had lowers my rating for the place."}
{"text":"It's a small sports bar, ordered wings and burgers and they were delicious. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Poor service
Closes early like almost one hour before the closing
The server giving us attitude, guess what? We went to st louis after and no more all star !!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday afternoon around 12:30 and there was not too many people at first but all of a sudden the place was packed. Every single table was taken but I think it was due to local businesses going out to have lunch. Many people recommended the Caesar does Texas flavour and I can see why people like it. The Caesar dressing with hot sauce makes for a good combination. This flavour is listed under the 3 pepper category and I found it to be NOT spicy at all. I also heard two other tables order this same flavour so I guess the word is spreading that this is the one to get.  Also got the \"Cheesy wheres the beef\" flavour which is really gravy and cheese on wings. There was so much extra gravy that I wish I had a side of fries. Each pound of wings is $10.95 and both flavours were very yummy.

Also got a full rack of baby back ribs for $24.95 which comes with coleslaw and option of fries/mash potato or baked potato. I went with the baked potato and it was amazing. Filled with melted cheese and bacon bits plus sour cream on the side. The coleslaw was not really the way I liked it. I like mine on the sweeter side. The ribs themselves were tender fall off the bone and the sauce they use was excellent. 

Service was excellent considering how busy they were. The only negatives were the fact that they did not have the dry rub sour cream flavoured wings that we had originally wanted and the coleslaw which came with the ribs. Also wish they had different sauce option for the ribs BUT not that the sauce they used wasn't good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, usually to watch sporting events, and so the place is typically busy. Last time I went I arrived early in order to get seats at the bar, which proved to be a good idea because it got packed quickly.

The bar area is okay, but I wish it was bigger. If you don't like personal space then the bar is great, otherwise it's pretty uncomfortable (especially with the inevitable sports fan flailing their arms angrily beside you). If you need to get up for any reason the person beside you will need to get up and let you out. Other than that the bar seemed fairly well stocked and the drinks were fine, no complaints but not memorable either. 

The restaurant area is very loud, and the food is okay (never tried the wings though, so can't comment on those). I usually find the service to be slow, but that could be because the place is so busy. We had to flag servers down to get their attention. My biggest complaint is how loud it is. The sound seems to bounce off of everywhere and amplify it. 

As far as sports bars go, this isn't my first choice, but it's okay and convenient to get to. If you can't make it to your favourite sports bar for a game, then this is a decent alternate option."}
{"text":"I love wings and if you're looking at this review, odds are you do too.

All Star Wings definitely delivers on the selection side. The flavour list of wings is massive and caters to all tastes. The 'Hot' selection was very mild, but had lots of great flavour.

The favorite of the table was 'Caesar does Texas', with it's combo of tangy bbq sauce topped with creamy caeser dressing. 'Hot Hawaiian', was also a fun favorite with it's mix of bbq, spices, pineapple and hot sauce. The ribs were also a crowd pleaser, as were the awesome Caeser Fries.

Service was good and the ambiance was very ... well, bar like. What else did you expect, a red carpet? 

All in all, if you're looking for an unhealthy, but tasty meal involving wings,  beer and possibly fries, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I work close by the Richmond Hill location and have given this restaurant a few tries with coworkers and have always left in disappointment and stomach upset.   Firstly, the service is terrible, the minute you walk through the doors there isn't anyone there to greet you, you have to go looking for a hostess.   Many times throughout of visits, we were left for long periods of time without drinks and sometimes waited over 30 minutes for our food.  The tilapia sandwich which was served to a co-worker of mine arrived partially frozen.  The only good food is the wings - stay away from everything else - terrible!  I won't be going back there again and many of my co-workers feel the same."}
{"text":"This is the ORIGINAL All Stars so I think it is the best one. The servers are friendly and efficient! My staple wings are Caesar Does Texas which always come sauced up which I love! I've been to other locations where the wings are lightly dusted with sauce but not here!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
This place started my wing craze. Although I've tried so many wing places in Toronto since after my first visit here, I'm still referring All Star as my absolute fave wing place in Toronto. 
Unlike other wings places (*cough* St. Louis *cough* Wild Wings *cough cough*), this place actually serves JUMBO sized wings. It's not tiny like a thumb and I actually have to eat around the bones. And, the wings actually taste fresh instead of dry and over-fried. 
I've tried about 20-30 flavours on the menu (lost count over the years), bloody Caesar is a must try! Many waitresses would recommend this flavour as customers' all time fave - believe her and try it! 
now, the secret of this place is - IT HAS THE BEST BEEF RIB IN TOWN!!!!! so if you are not in the wing mood and your friends drag you to this place, try their BEEF RIB! you wont be disappointed. 
Come on an UFC night or a Hockey night! you will love the interactive experience with your neighbor table (provided that you don't get into a fight)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday to get the specials and I was not disappointed. I got 15 wings of Cesar does Texas and that's all I need in life.

I also got the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was okay.

Service here was average compared to the service at the McCowan location."}
{"text":"Growing up in the area All Star was one of my first choices for wings. In my most recent visit, I feel this place has really gone downhill for the food, service and overall experience.
We waited at least 5mins to be seated even when 40% of the store was open. The girls kept walking past us and acted like they were severely understaffed when it was clearly not the case.
When we were seated, waters came late and it took her a while to take our orders.
This time we ordered dry cajun, hail caesar and pandora's box. The wait was longer than average compared to other bar like places for food...at least 20mins I'd say.
They also put us in a table where the closest 3 overhead lights were burnt out. I mean, how expensive are light bulbs? It's pretty sad when the TV is your prominent light source at dinner...
When the wings came, I was further disappointed. The hail caesar wings were definitely sitting around for a while, since the wings absorbed most of the caesar dressing - it looked unsauced on the outside but drenched in oil compared to the other ones. The dry cajun flavour was nice, but the spices were so unevenly coated, you get a bland wing half the time. Pandora's box (a mild spicy wing) which is one of our go tos was decent but cannot redeem any of the other failures.
I was very disappointed since I remember growing up and loving this place. I really hope management turn this around."}
{"text":"All Stars is my favourite place for wings, they offer a ton of flavours with very creative names (some you do have to ask for a description, as you wouldn't know what it was from juts the name). The environment is very much like a bar, dim lighting and quite loud.

My favourite flavour is Caesar Does Texas, it is the perfect combination of creamy garlic with a little bit of heat. Each order of wings comes with a few carrot/celery sticks and dip, which is a nice little bonus. The fries are also delicious and come in generous portions.

On Mondays, 1lb of wings is half price with the purchase of a beverage.

The service at this location is a hit or miss... some days they are quite understaffed..and others, it is great."}
{"text":"We came here last night for the Monday special (1.5lb of wings for the price of 1) as I've been told it's no longer required to purchase a drink..when we asked our server she advised that we needed to get a drink.. so we did.

Upon ordering a diet coke and a coke (I don't normally drink pop)..all drinks are served in red plastic \"Coca Cola/Allstars\" cups...upon first sip... it was PEPSI. I mean, not the end of the world, but it would've been nice to let me know that the restaurant serves Pepsi products instead of Coke (as advertised on the menu). 

Secondly, upon getting our orders, it seems that they've gotten a lot smaller than what they used to be when I went regularly back in University... plus.. no veggie sticks & dip? really?

Lastly, our server never once came to check up on us throughout the meal, until we were done. What about the \"bottomless\" sodas? What if I needed something? It wasn't overly busy either, it was a cold, rainy Monday night in April after all.

Overall, probably won't be returning to this location, from what I remember, the service and atmosphere at the Woodbine location is much more lively.

PS. Check in on yelp and receive 10% off!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few allstars location. The markham location is probably my favourite location. Probably say the best service yet. And I'm comparing to the Vaughn location. They always check up on us and filling up the glasses of water if you're drinking water. Servers are just wonderful here. Always smiling no matter how busy it is. Great atmosphere. Way to go girls!!! Don't know their names. But if I did I would mention who they are bit great girls!!"}
{"text":"monday special is buy a pound of wings get a half pound free, wings are ok, sometimes its very very over cooked

 staff is friendly, nice place to go to on a monday 3/5 stars cause the wings at all stars are overcooked and dry sometimes."}
{"text":"This location has decent service. I come here purely for the wings, and they do not have a lack of variety. My favourite is My Ranch Is On Fire. The server also recommended Desperado, which is similar, nothing too unique so I'll stick to the ranch. Unfortunately both times we ordered takeout here the packer forgot something small (not enough for us to go back, but significant enough to be annoying, like a sauce or a side).

EDIT: even though on the menu it says veges included, apparently you have to specify that you want it in order to get it. Recently tried another saucy flavour that had parmesan cheese in it, i dont remember what it was called but is one of the hotter ones and it was DAMNNNN gooood. And I love the jaleleno poppers... a nice small amount of heat!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for wings and a pint! Wings are huge! And tasty! Caesar Does Texas, Hot Honey and Pandora's Box are awesome :) Also the breaded onion scoops :) Always busy. Service is quick and friendly. Food always comes out hot and fresh. Prices are fair. Good sports bar atmosphere. Been coming for years and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place for wings with great selection and great quality.  I would say better than st louis and mmm equivalent to duffs.  Though st louis fries cant be beat with that side dill...
  

this is sparta: spicy with honey garlicish
texas does ceaser: ceaser with thai flavour
lemon and pepper dry:  seasoning flavour taht really tasted just like that. no burst of goodness.


also, they now serve cakes.  cheesecake factory cakes. which was delicious and amazing. though you can tell it wasn't a day fresh. but of course, it is imported. though the flavour is the same i belive. and pretty cheap at 5 to 6 dollars."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for some wings and fries with my girlfriend.  We were greeted and seated fairly quickly with our orders placed pretty quickly.  Parking's shared with T&T but there's still ample space on this side.

Wings were pretty good, nothing to complain about there.  We ordered loaded fries (fries with shredded cheese, bacon and gravy).  Holy moly, this was filling.  My favourite part is they don't use cheese curds (which I'm personally not a fan of).  The portion was gigantic.  The bacon, however, was pretty tasteless and I could barely tell there were any there to begin with and the fries were a little overcooked.  Also of note: When we ordered, both the soup and slush drinks were on the menu, but neither were \"served at this location\", which is a bit of a downer.

Service was solid as Brenda filled our drinks (without us asking, actually) and was pretty patient with us.  The place itself is a little small, but there wasn't anyone there on a Saturday at 5:30pm.  Prices run a little higher than Wild Wing and Boston Pizza by a few bucks here or there.

I wasn't really overwhelmed by anything and I'm thinking overcooked fries was a one-off.  Still would consider returning - solid, quick service and good food can still be had here."}
{"text":"A specialty wings place, with dozens and dozens of flavours.. from spicy to sour to sweet, drenched in sauce to completely dry.. this place will have something for everyone. The only fault for me is the lack of beers on tap: Molson, Coors Light or Rickards Red. 

The place isn't very big, so if going with a large group, be sure that everyone arrives at the same time. In my experience you will not get a table for 6 or more unless everyone in the party is there."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the wing orders. Used to come regularly but have not been here for a while. Now I remember why. Seven (7) tiny wings does not equate to a pound of wings... 3 out of 7 wings were deformed. A wide variety of flavors , so if you find one you like, get the local pub here in Richmond Hill to create the flavor.(King Henry's at 16th and Yonge St) You will get a decent order of wings."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat when you're craving some wings and want to watch sports. Ordered my fave Pandora's box, and a side of Greek fries (with upgrade to beer batter). Although food was tasty, service was a little lacking. Had to remind them for our water after our food was brought out."}
{"text":"This is a really good place and a flavourful place for wings, but over they years they have decreased quality while increasing prices. Nevertheless, still one of the top places to eat wings especially for the service ;)"}
{"text":"Just another all star. Still don't get the hype. It's just confusing and the wings are smaller and fattier now."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is a perfect way to describe this place. Servers are sweet, but have a hard time describing many of the flavours of the wings. Cleanliness is below average as tables sat uncleaned from the point I sat down until I left. As for the wings, they were soggy and disappointing. IMO, there are other options nearby that are consistently better."}
{"text":"All stars has really gone downhill since it was a single location operation in Markham. The wings tend to be greasy and oversauced, fries are always soggy and flavourless. You're always guaranteed at least one mutant-wing in every 10 you order which is either all fat/skin or has a broken bone that leaked blood and marrow into the meat. Anyway, I always avoid the chain, which is a shame because I was once a huge advocate until the awful drop in quality."}
{"text":"Yes, technically it's a restaurant. In reality though, it's hard to feel comfortable at a place that is completely deserted and abandoned. When we got there at 3pm on sunday it was completely empty and the servers were almost surprised to see anyone. Food is very so-so. Combined with service it's obvious that I won't be recommending this to anyone."}
{"text":"All Star Wings is 30km from my house in a random plaza that I always think also contains a Future Shop while we are driving there... but it does't.   This has nothing to do with their wings, but it always just seems so random when we are driving PAST HWY 7 and laughing and talking about the non-existant Future Shop.

My ultimate chicken wings are:
- non breaded
- crispy & saucy
- butter vinegar hot sauce (NOT a ketchupy sauce... ever.)
- celery and bleu cheese (some dill/garlic sauces can be acceptable but they are few and far between.  Avocado sour cream is not an acceptable substitute.)

The All Star operates outside of these strict guidelines and still finds success in my books.  This in itself is a feat.

The good:
- All Star successfully breaks almost of my chicken wings rules.  Seriously.
- There are a tonne of wing flavours and my favourites are outside of the traditional Buffalo-style hot sauce
- The wings are crispy and very saucy, and while they break my non-breaded rule with a flour 'dusting,' I find it alarming successful
- My party of 2 is always seated in a booth designed to seat 8

The bad:
- They ration the serviettes...  they have some of the sauciest wings going, and bring you 1 and you have to ask for more
- The beer selection isn't great
- The 90+ wing flavours are not described in any way on the menu.  They just list them and you have to ask the waitress to describe the flavours in their very non-descriptive names.  It's annoying.  
- It's 30km away form anything else that I want to be around and there is no Future Shop in the plaza.

I will continue to eat wings here and try a new flavour each time.  Here are my tasting notes from the last 2 visits:

1. Chiplote Jerk - Mike likes these but I think they're too hot.  They are flavourful hot though.
2. American - This is a Buffalo style but it isn't hot enough even for me.  I would not get this one again, but if there is a hotter version we would try it.
3. Wings Gone Wild - mustard, honey and hot.  This was a favourite but it wasn't hot at all.
4. Wings Gone Wilder - a hotter version of Wings Gone Wild.  Not sure if I liked them better a bit hotter, but they were really good.  Mike did not really like these, he found them too sweet.
5. Caesar does Texas - these are great.  American style wings with parmesan and Caesar dressing on them.  We would consider getting a hotter version of this next time.  They are heavy with the cheese and cream dressing.  Definitely one to split."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - this place was a bit of a blur for me, for a few reasons.

First of all, the wing selection is, in a word, ostentatious.  There's so many varieties that you'll actually feel intimidated and lost, kinda like the first time you had sex.  Or every time...for...this person I know.  Anyway.  It was still GOOD - like, GREAT - but you're all like \"what?  what do I do now?  do i?  no...can't be.  jeez, what the hell am i even doing?\" and then you stumble around and make a choice and just go for it and it all works out great.  What I'm saying with the previous stupidly run-on sentence is that you can't go wrong here.  Everything on the menu is seven kinds of awesome.

Secondly, once I ate the wings, they were so fantastic that I became a little delirious and the whole thing degenerated into that scene in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas where Dr. Gonzo and Raoul Duke show up at the hotel bar and dinosaurs are having an alcohol-fueled orgy and the carpets are covered in blood and flowers that grow and shrink depending on how your eyes are focusing at that moment.  Or a reasonable facsimile thereof (in my MIND ONLY, I should caution - I think).

So from what I can recollect through my wing-addled haze, the place is full of fat white suburbanites making horrendous slurping noises and leering, frat jocks wearing sports jerseys and giving each other violently heterosexual chest-bumps, families with shrieking devil-children putting gum into each others' hair and lots and lots of Italian men wearing effeminate sandals made of lizard skin.

And you know what?  All that crazy bullshit doesn't even matter, because the wings are the bomb diggity.  It doesn't matter that the ambiance is only slightly superior to the lower deck of a Spanish galleon during Columbus' time, if they were outfitted with LCD TVs - I guarantee you won't care once the wings hit your mouth.

Just go here.  Now."}
{"text":"Ordered 10lbs of wings to add to our super bowl feast. We got honey garlic, BBQ, American, baha,  Jamaican jerk. All were great flavours and the jerk and baha were the hit of the party. They should have a deal for 10 lbs not just 2 orders of 5lbs. The place was busy with Pickups just before the game and they had my order ready when promised for. We will be back"}
{"text":"I am a wing lover, and i love all stars, just not this location. This rating is for this location only.

I have been to all stars many times, but only twice to this location. Service was great, but the wings were pretty puny. 

The second time i came here the server even told me \"today our wings are really small so were going to give you a few extra to make up for it\" and i was expecting at least 3-4 more. I only got one extra puny wing. I was pretty disappointed.
 
I recommend going to the one on young as I've had really good consistency wing and service wise"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! So many wing options, literally hundreds of choices. Glad the waitress helped us with our order and gave us a suggestions. Overall wings are good, my favourite was the one that the waitress recommended and that was the Cesar parmesan type of dressing on our wings. So tasty and great service! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings, probably one of the best wings in the area. Good variety and quality of Drinks as well.
As a sports bar not the greatest as many angles have bad or far locations for the TVs, so if you come to watch a game its either come earlier or just don't."}
{"text":"Use to love going here. One day did take out got desperato wings. Tasted old and dirty. The potato skins were good but I was disappointed in the quailty of the wings."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday looking for a deal for wings...and it didn't have any specials but came here anyways!

The Good: There are soo many flavors to choose from for your wings (1 full page to be exact)! The fries are pretty good here too. Good service.

The Bad: It can be overwhelming and it doesn't explain what the flavors are with the funky names. How is anyone supposed to guess?! I ordered one flavor and they told me they ran out of the tzatziki sauce and I was super disappointed.

I also noticed deals posted on the wall, which was on Thursday I believe, isn't a great deal at all! It was just getting a half lb for free with the purchase of wings and drink."}
{"text":"Best Chicken wing place in Canada. Over 100 flavours of wings, and they have a Wall of Flame, where they post pictures of the few who eat off a whole container of the hottest wings they have. Note that you have to sign a waiver before consuming the super spicy wings, in case it messes up with your insides. 

The Americans I know who travel to Toronto for business love this place and frequent it often. As do the locals. Its a must do in Toronto."}
{"text":"The selection of wings is awesome, and super tasty.  Need I say more?

Well, they down-rate the heat rating of the wings.  I had some 4-flame wings which barely registered anything to me.  3-flame were downright candy.  And they say they have the best ribs north of Texas.  Are they kidding me?  Baton Rouge down on the 7 blows it away, and Baton Rouge isn't even the best either.

Has sorta a \"hooters\" vibe with the servers if you know what I mean.  But cool having a TV at the booth.  Say good bye to social interaction."}
{"text":"A friend and I made the extra trip to try out this location (as opposed to closer ones) because it was larger and apparently had more TV screens.

ATMOSPHERE: As advertised, this All Star Wings had more seating, plenty of television screens, and was more lively than the other locations. Seems like an ideal place to catch a game with friends

FOOD: On the waitresses recommendation, we went with popular \"Caesar Does Texas\" wings and the \"Ephestius\" wings. Accompanied the wings with a basket of \"Loaded fries.\"  

Neither wing was as hot as we were expecting (listed under \"Hot\" and \"Hotter\"), but tasted good in other ways. My buddy enjoyed the CDT, while the Ephestius was much more my speed - so this worked out well. The Ephestius was really unique in that it had some kind of peppered Greek dressing that differentiated itself from most wings I've had previously. Of course one could always choose from one of the other 100 or so flavour options on the menu. 

SERVICE: The service staff was quite attentive, and kept checking in to see if we needed anything - much appreciated. The food actually came out quicker than expected, given that it was a pretty busy Friday night.

SUMMARY: Would definitely come back for the food and the atmosphere - just wish it were a bit closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"One of the better wings spots in Richmond Hill
I used to come here a lot more often back in the days, and it always used to impress on every visit.

They have some great selections of sauces, a long page full
All wings are normally well-dressed, with large size wings. They also have a good menu of other pub-food items.

My favourite sauces are the scorpion bite and Armageddon if you can handle it!"}
{"text":"I was ready to challenge the hottest wings at All Star Wings and Ribs! 

The Armageddon which suppose to be really really hot, so hot you need to sign a waiver in order to eat that.....

And DAMN! They don't have it!!! According to reliable sources, this location had not served that for over 2 years. No, not because no one is brave enough to order it but they just don't have it in stock....

So reluctantly we settled for the A Bomb and the H Bomb and some Fries with Gravy.

How hot is H Bomb.... Accordingly to my friends, those suckers were the hottest thing they ever ate. I believed them when I saw how their faces turned all red, with tears in their eyes and sweat on their faces. But they both finished their 5 H Bomb wings!

Luckily refills on soft drinks and water are free... and they just drinking nonstop trying to lessen the heat....

Aside from the wings being spicy... they were pretty tasty, and not overcooked or dry.

Monday Wings Special 15 wings for the price of 10 is a sweet deal... oh can I say it is one Spicy deal!!!"}
{"text":"All Star Wings & Ribs has all the elements of being an awesome sport bar.

TVs and TVs and more TVs showing almost every sports at the same time. Your friend will definitely be happy, especially when he is not in the mood to talk to you. On the other hand, he might be checking something else while you busy eating your wings.

But guys, please don't bring a girl here for the first date, you might never have a second chance.

Waitress are friendly, nice and hot! May not be as hot as some of the wings. 

The wings might be the reason I will be coming back. Crispy outside and tender inside and with all these choices of flavours, decisions...decisions....

Beers, Wings, TVs and \"Scantily Dressed\"* Waitress... now you know why All Star Wings & Ribs has all these 4 stars rating from all the Yelp friends I hang out with!

{"text":"Please, please, All Star Wings, open a location in downtown Toronto. PLEASE!

With a menu of wings that is well over 90 varieties, how can I only go here once a year? Why must you be in Markham and Richmond Hill?

The first time I came here, I remember being awestruck. Their variations of Caesar wings are the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth. Breaded, deep-fried, covered in caesar dressing and parmesan cheese? Heaven.

Basically All-Star's is a sports bar in a strip mall -- but they have the best wings I have ever had in my life. They have a gazillion different varieties with clever names like Scorpion Kiss and Bizarre Love Triangle, ranging from super mild to Armageddon. I think I have an average tolerance of spice and my mouth was on fire around the four star mark. Stick to the 2-3 range to keep it manageable.

They've got wings with all sorts of flavours -- jerk chicken, honey garlic, and all sorts of spice, but the great thing is that there's something for everyone (except vegetarians) and you can order 10 of each flavour which is great for a group.

If you have access to a car or can make it out, I totally recommend stopping by for a life-changing experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how a chicken wing is labeled an \"all-star\", but there must have been a lot of injuries to the starting lineup because these wings were tiny and subpar. The reason people go here is wings and they don't do a good job with that, so why go? The wings aren't cheap either AND if you order 2 lbs you can still only get one flavour unless you're willing to pay an extra $2. Seriously? These wings are not all-star wings they're tee ball wings. Go somewhere that takes pride in their food and skip this joint."}
{"text":"Personally, I LOVE ALL STAR WINGS!! 

Why? because it has TONS of flavour! MOST of the flavour tastes AWESOME!! 

All wings go on a spicy scale, and I would really die to try out the spiciest one. However, I am not ready to die yet so I will wait until later on in my life for that.

To conclude, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! thats all I need to say. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I stopped going to All Star for a few years because the wings were never really that good and had a weird, stale oil kind of, taste.

I have given it another chance and I'm glad I did. They've renovated and the wings taste better.

Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The wings were alright but the service was first class! One of the  downside was the menu had way too many choices of favors. I had to ask three times for a definition of the choices."}
{"text":"It's a decent wing place. There are many many many flavours to choose from; almost too overwhelming.

Wings are tasty. I enjoyed the lemon & pepper (dry wings) and spicy ranch (forgot the funky name on the menu already). 
Fries are soggy though. Didn't like them as much."}
{"text":"Best selection of wings I have ever seen. From sweet to crazy insane spicy. Great place to watch hockey. They even put a TV on for us to watch the habs plays. Good sport......Been there 3 times and will be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good here and the servers aren't half bad either if you catch my drift. Tons of tv screens for sporting events going on and the ambience is nice. I come here with the boys every so often and have yet to be disappointed. My favourite flavour of wing would have to be 'All thai'd up'. its like a mildly hot sweet ranch. my only complaint of this place is that the list of flavours is extremely long and with no descriptions. You'd have to ask the waitress what this this this or that is and it gets tiresome. You really have to trust the server's opinion and hope her taste buds aren't drastically different from your own. But still a good place to go."}
{"text":"Over 100 flavours. But it's more like 10 flavours mixed in differing combinations. 

Used to come here often to watch the game and eat wings. Not the healthiest choice, so I will have to limit my trips here for sure"}
{"text":"Waitress forgot my order and even served it to another customer before coming back to me.  Never got my fries with my order.  Never got a fork and the ketchup bottle was empty.

Waitresses never came to check up on me and I just got up and left.

All stars? More like one star."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since before it became popular and expanded. It used to be a wonderful hidden gem in Markham. However, after the renovations, food quality and service has definitely dropped. I always order the Wings Gone Wilder and Ceaser Does Texas. Although still good, they do not compare to the flavours before. I would still recommend this place to everyone for there great food. Hopefully, the taste and flavour goes back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"-Used to come here once a month for years

-Got 10 wings for lunch (~12.50), didnt include forks, ended up 20min longer than quoted

-Pathetically small pieces and ridiculous price considering what we have nearby now"}
{"text":"Defiantely top 5 on my list to get wings, I'd say they're similar to Wild Wings, but a lot cheaper. I used to go to the Markham location, but this place has a lot more room. Over 100 different flavours and I think when I last visited they were adding more. My favourite is nero's epilogue, I think it's with mayo, tabasco sauce and parmessan cheese. If your craving wings, you can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"The most satisfying thing about All-Stars, other than their wings, is the sound you hear when you toss your chicken bones into the bucket and reach for another wing."}
{"text":"This is my place... (well, not owned by me... but frequented by me).  
This place is known for it's wings.. which are FANTASTIC.  But they also have great burgers.. I love their burgers.. the 3 cheese burger is awesome.  Classic cheese and bacon is awesome.  One of my favourites is the mehican (although it can get a little bit messy).  Beer is always cold and the service is great (funny, attentive, and friendly)
The management team keeps a close eye on everything and ensures the whole place operates smoothly.  
Based on the below review... I think I might try one of their hot dogs too.  Great location, great food, great service.  
A+ in my books"}
