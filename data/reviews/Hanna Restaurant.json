{"text":"Seemed like a cool little bar to grab a glass of wine before a show.  This had to be the worst glass of cabernet we've both ever had.  We were able to get down about half a glass before giving up and we never let wine go to waste!   We should have known when there was no wine list.  Once we got the bill, we realized it was way overpriced.  We will not be back.   I know there's much more than wine here and maybe the food is good, but that definitely left a bad taste in our mouth!"}
{"text":"I was prepared to give this place 3 stars.  Not completely inedible food, nice server, cozy bar area.  Mon cher chou is a gentleman and would never dream of telling me how much dinner cost.  But since all the menus had prices, I realized that a dinner here cost more than dinner at the Flying Fig.    Sorry.  If you are going to charge that much, the food had better be spectacular.

It is most decidedly NOT.

First off, the bread at the table was cold and completely stale.  Mon cher chou's crab cake had far too much filler and the crab was of the pulverized canned variety.  My scallop appetizer which featured some oddly corn-free corn relish was zingy and very tasty, but the scallops were overcooked.  Mon cher chou's $28 bowl of pasta and seafood was bizzarely  bland and featured completely inedible, pneumatic scallops.  My steak salad was passable but very, very light on the bleue cheese and other enumerated toppings.

Pathetic food aside, the prices were particularly shocking for a place that resembles an overly illuminated diner.  The bar was much cozier, but they seemed at a loss when people decided to eat there instead of the main dining room.

Luckily my night was salvaged by the fantastic company and the mind-blowing Laurie Anderson concert that followed.
