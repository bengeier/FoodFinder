{"text":"Love it! Great wine and food that takes me back to Spain. Awesome interior but small, great patio."}
{"text":"It's really hard to get a spot at this bar as it is quite small. Waiting time on a Friday night at 8pm was an hour. If you're lucky enough to arrive when there is an empty spot on the \"patio\" (waiting area), you could huddle around a high table (no seats) or a bench. Definitely not the spot for a big crowd of people, keep the party to a maximum of four people / or a date. The waiters are decent. The cocktails are nice. The appetizers are nice, but expect very small portions. I would come again, but probably not in the near future."}
{"text":"I feel like the name of this spot should be Bar Revel, not Bar Raval. There always seems to be a party here, regardless of the time of day or weather. The first time I visited, it was a Wednesday evening, and too busy to sit and catch up with a friend. The next time, I was lucky enough to snag a seat at the beautiful wooden bar for a coffee. The Cafe Raval was a tasty, only slightly overpriced mocha.  I was kind of surprised that the space was nearly standing room at 3pm on a Sunday. Then I remembered this bar has been featured in lifestyle/design magazines enough times in the last 6 months to make Toronto seem desperate for cool spots. Which definitely wasn't why I was there... Service was attentive and prompt for such a busy place. They open at 8, so I'd go there for a coffee again on a morning I was feeling indulgent.  When I went last week it was with a group for drinks, so we opted to stand around a barrel on the enclosed patio. It's hard for the patio not to look temporary and a little shoddy compared to the intricately detailed interior, but for an outdoor winter drink, it's cheaper and less smelly than the distillery district and closer than a German Christmas market. I'm guessing Partisans didn't come back to winterize the patio with poly and 2x4s though. It's consistent with the neighborhood, but someone should at least put a spring on the door.  The beer list is perhaps a bit short, but they were happy to make us custom cocktails. My hot toddy was nicely spiced and warm, and my friends were happy with their drinks. Service was great again, and we got coffee to go with our bill no problem.  Bar Raval is a great spot to go if you fly solo and like interiors that look like wooden spaceships. Less so if you hate people and love seating."}
{"text":"I only had a (creatively crafted, stiff) beverage here on a busy Wednesday night on opening week. The place is straight out of Barcelona, as if designed by Gaudi himself (did Gaudi inspire Dr Seuss by the way?). It's a must-see. Nothing else like this exists in Toronto. Have some tapas while you're at it."}
{"text":"awesome place for great food and amazing cocktails!! Not a big fan of the canned stuff, but I love pretty much everything else. I always go for the  Pintxos and tapas options. Croquetas are great, shrimp paste over toast or boquerones and cream paste over toast for example are amazing! Cocktail program is on point here too; so far all cocktails I have tried were well balanced and enjoyable. Lots of sherry wine in the cocktails, from fino to amontillado  and olosoro..you name it, it's all over their cocktail list, and I love it. I just wish it was a little bigger and with more seats. I understand the concept of Spanish tapas and the idea of eating standing while socializing, but..aahh the food and cocktails are so good, I wish I could sit and enjoy for hours. But no, 1 or 2 drinks, some food and get out. I'm getting old... either way, I come by once every 2 months or so at least."}
{"text":"amazing 10/10! Walked in with my dad around 3 last Friday just shopping in the area just wanting one celebratory glass of proseco and one or two pincho, well I ran into some friends dad left and I stayed for hours. Around 10 pm after our 5th bottle I started to think about what to do with my car (thanks mom)  . That's how lovely and welcoming they are here you just want to stay a while.  Staff are friendly and well learned. Owner was nice enough to sit and chat for a while and made sure to say goodbye. Bonus points for vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Solid place to get a cocktail and tapas for lunch. Cool dark ambience with carved wood everywhere and those big chunks of cure meats suspending from ceiling in the kitchen- def. reminded me of Spain.  Aside from the amazing cured meats, the baguette was one of the best with crunchy yet chewy crust and light/ airy inside. The hot octopus with crispy pan fried potato was very good. Mushroom towel was yummy- mushrooms were so juicy!"}
{"text":"There is no other bar than Bar Raval. The food, ambience, music, service - incredible. Memories of El Raval......this place speaks for itself!!!"}
{"text":"Great tapas, lots of options along with outstanding drinks and lively atmosphere, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Barcelona, walking into Bar Raval is like breathing in that air again. The stunning interior of Gaudi-inspired wood-carved curves is unlike anything else in Toronto. Though there are a few stools about, this is meant to be a standing-only space and echoes its European counterparts where grabbing a quick bite and a drink is only one of many stops in a delicious string of pearls.  I've long been a fan of Van Gameran's food and the eats don't disappoint. Breakfast spans both sweet and savoury and there is plenty to choose from. Two to three bite snacks - pintxo for the uninitiated - are on the menu with baked goods lining the counter.   Worth waking up early for. Am excited to return and sample their lunch eats."}
{"text":"Great experience, different food which I very much enjoyed very tasty. Casual and cozy atmosphere . Haven't been there in the evening but, lunch was great. Will go back to try dinner ."}
{"text":"I think one of the first issues with this bar is managing your expectations. For some odd reason people in Toronto believe that Tapas = full dinner and hanging around for hours. As such the place gets packed very quickly and you're unlikely to find anything for most of the night. Hats off to them for that, it's a big success! However, the service at times leaves much to be desired (as is often the case in Toronto). The last time I went I inquired into availability and the doorman (at a resto?) gave me the \"big time\" treatment.   Nevertheless I'll call a spade a spade and say that they've come up with a very good concept. The cocktails are great and the food is very well executed with wonderful authentic ingredients, which negates the need fo complexity. I wouldn't qualm about the price, because the price for good ingredients here is most certainly higher than it is in Spain, and they are honest with their offerings.  One can only hope the concept catches on and we can have a few more of these places around town given the interest....but seriously, Tapas isn't dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Toronto! Great beer and cocktail selection, as well as great service! Be prepared to stand because this place is always busy!"}
{"text":"Just walked in with my husband for dinner and unfortunately we were not able to get a seat. The reason for that is because they barely have any stools. If you are looking to sit down with friends to have nice tapas and drinks this is definately not the place, unless you want to stand around a barrel the whole time."}
{"text":"This was honestly the best meal we have had all year. Absolutely loved the space and thought it was as close to our Barcelona experience as one could get in Toronto. The food was outstanding. Favourites were the croquettes, kitchen bread, mushroom tower, and beef tenderloin. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"I go to Raval at least three times a week.  The coffee is amazing and so are the cocktails. The food is off the rails good and decor is like nothing Toronto has ever seen.  This restaurant is a work of art and I'm so happy it's close to home for me."}
{"text":"Went there last night to meet a few friends whom were seated on the patio. I got there an explained to the glorified security guard that I was there to see a few friends and they were seated 6 feet away from where I was standing. Later told there was an 8 person limit on the patio. Nice place great atmosphere but annoying to go all the way there and find out there is a limit as to how many people can be seated on the patio when there was room for at least 6 more people there comfortably."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place!  Perfect place to sip wine, chat and snack on delicious food.  I love the vibe of this place, the service, and yes the woodwork is gorgeous.  My absolute favourite dish is the preserved sardines - sooo good!  I also recommend ordering the tomato bread with the cantabrian anchovies.  Our server suggested this and it was delicious!   Other items I also enjoyed were the chorizo, cecina, croquetas, sweetbreads, and chicken gizzards.  Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and made great suggestions.  I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. The tapas display on the counter reminds me of my time in Spain, hitting up a variety of tapas bars in one night to sample different dishes. Service was excellent as well.   Tapas highlights: -Foie Gras, Cherry & PX Sherry Vinegar (perfect flavor and texture, and sherry vinegar is a genius balance to the creaminess and saltiness of the foie gras) -Dulce de Leche & Crispy Jamon Donut (not very sweet, surprisingly, with a great touch of savory falvor from the bacon) -Mixed Clams (the sauce is delicious) -Adobo Pork Bocadillo (this was just OK in my book...thought it was a little bland in flavor)  All in all a great little authentic hidden gem. Will visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a walk around Kensington and was blown away. Toronto (in my opinion) has a really solid food scene that is available to the masses and is on the up and up - and this restaurant is a representation of that - but more, it has such an edge and quality that it lifts the scene here easily. The interior is stunning, so much thought and hard work -  it feels like you're standing in a little tapas bar in Barcelona. The staff were professional yet approachable, very knowledgeable, obviously proud of where they work, and accommodating. The menu offers a little for everyone; from the adventurous to the comfort zone limiting -  I'd list what we ate and drank, but there's little point - we tried a lot and everything was delicious.   Seriously, new favourite spot in Toronto. Can't wait to check out the patio over the Summer - if I am lucky to get a spot."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. I had high hopes coming in due to all the raving going on about Bar Isabel. The \"chef\" was probably 22 years old and was the only one in the kitchen next to the dishwasher. We tried the octopus, squid, pigs head and chorizo. ALL underwhelming and over priced for what you were getting. I understand the concept of small plates but this was not worthy of the price. For example, for the \"pigs head\" we received 2 shavings of ham on crostini. Also, you receive a side of chips with certain meals and I am almost positive they were Miss Vicky's due to the perfect colouring on every single chip. If they were made in house (as they should have been) they would probably vary in colour and sizes. I had a citrus-y cocktail and that was quite nice so I'll give credit where it is due."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The woodwork inside really needs to be seen too. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Been there a few times now and can honestly say I haven't had anything bad yet. Everything is super delicious n the drinks strong! Great bar night spot with friends."}
{"text":"It was an awesome experience. Food, house cava and the cocktails were all very good. Warm pumpkin and walnut salad is a must try. We were literally blown away, specially given the fact that I am not a big fan of pumpkin. Foie Gras was expensive but was extremely good and so were the rest of the food. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had heard great things but was very disappointed. The manchego was luke warm and awful. The Iberico Bellota was thickly cut and meh. The olives weren't warm and clearly store bought. The Octopus Raval was cold and flavorless. I've been to Spain numerous times and this barely qualifies as Spanish fare. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! I've been waiting for a place like this my whole life... Beautiful decor, excellent service, fantastic bar and food... we ordered some cheese, the kitchen bread, sardines, mushrooms and a few drinks. Everything was outstanding and VERY reasonably priced compared to other eclectic restaurants in Toronto. I can feed three or four people there plus drinks for around $100. The quality is outstanding as everything is done in house. The bartender was very skilled and friendly as were the servers. This is honestly my new favourite spot in all of Toronto. Highly recommended! Just a heads up that the place seems almost always quite busy - as any great establishment should be but everyone, clientele and staff alike are laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Thursday evening without reservations, but was on my own, so managed a place at the main bar skipping ahead of the hordes of people braving the cold in the covered patio.  The bar is outrageous and a seat at it, to enjoy the show put on by the bartenders is a must. Speaking of which, try a cocktail or three.  I've never been disappointed - all are very cleverly put together and delicious.  Enjoyed the manchego with some pig's head, followed by razor clams in mojo verde.  The clams are a must try, if for the sauce alone. For a hot dish I tried the tripe stew.  Sauce was great, but I didn't find there was enough tripe - the headliner was co-opted by the sausage.  Finished with basque cheesecake, which is baked (almost to a caramelized char on the outside) and probably the largest single dish on the menu.  Too much for one, but far better than Uncle Tetsu's, so it's worth it for even a couple of bites."}
{"text":"Great spot with a unique vibe, although smaller than you would think from the pictures.  Casual atmosphere and always busy - not the place for an intimate date.  I would also not recommend this for large parties (more than 4-6) Service is great, although you will likely have to wait for a spot.  Not many places to sit down so prepare to stand or sit at a bar stool.  As the weather improves, they also have an outside patio you can enjoy.  Excellent tapas and cocktail options."}
{"text":"nothing worth being hyped for.  drinks wise, worst bees knees I've ever had. mostly was lemon juice, barely could taste the gin and honey. negroni was fine though.   food was mostly just ok. best dish was the smoked mackerel served in a can. everything else we had (such as the hanger steak, hot octopus, chorizo, shishito peppers) left impressions that faded all too quickly, especially considering the pricepoints."}
{"text":"His & Hers   I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for.... I can't remember his name but he asked what I liked and I said champagne, sweet and no spirit of preference. He stated they could make something for me and the did! Specialty made drink was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Yes yes all of the yes!!!  Before i get into the food, let me start off by saying that the little tappas buffet inside the restauant was on FIRE!!! They are famous for their jamon donut...and i gotta tell ya.... it was ridiculous. Crazy good!  The menu has lots of vareity and everything was excellent. The tomato bread is decent (needs a little more salt in my opinion) but what do i know,i like everything over seasoned hehe  Some great minds put this menu together and im happy i get to have eat it all! Also awesome that  they are open from 8am to 2am daily so i can get my bar raval fix at any time of day!  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience, all of our dishes were excellent and we enjoyed trying out some new flavors. Staff was knowledgable and helpful in making recommendations. A few highlights were the tomato bread, the oysters, croquettes, beef tenderloin and the lamb. We also enjoyed a few seafood dishes, wish I could recall names from the menu, but included shrimp and scallops. I wasn't a huge fan of the cured meats but others in our group liked the chorizo. We were lucky to score an outdoor table at the front of the restaurant that was a little quieter than the backside, which allowed our group easy conversation without a ton of background noise. Cocktail menu had a good selection. The cheesecake was heavenly, probably one of the best I've had and I consider myself a cheesecake snob. It's located in a cute neighborhood and had a lively atmosphere on a Monday night. Will definitely be back when I'm next in Toronto."}
{"text":"visited with my wife on sat night. place was busy with right vibe. service was excellent, professional and courteous. food was very good. i would say excellent but 1 dish wasnt properly cooked and felt a little on the raw side (shrimp dish)- we were not charge for the dish at the end which i think was very nice of management but every other bite we had was very tasty. best bite was sausage, bacon with an egg on top. the bread they serve was also very tasty. mushroom tower was outstanding. the wine by the glass was on the very expensive side and a not very generously served, as a result we paid $36 for 3 glasses of what they claimed was 5onces but really was way probably less so here is something for management to work on (cause at this ratio the bottle would be near $80 for house wine!). nice selection of beers and cocktails. there was a cool vibe around inside restaurant  and on patio, most people are standing around high cocktail tables and portion are meant to share all in all,  4 star for sure..."}
{"text":"Went with friends for lunch. A great menu of delicious tapas and fancy drink list. Go in the evening for the drink + tapas. Or go during lunch for tapas and a brunch drink. Works well either way.  The tapas were all very fancy and delicious. And not to mention very unique. Won't find many of their items anywhere else!   Bar setting indoors and tables on the outside (heated patio I think)."}
{"text":"Best Toronto has to offer! Wonderful jam on Serrano, oysters and cava. I really enjoyed the octopus. Would eat here any day of the week!"}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to going out to Bar Raval and were completely disappointed by the entire experience.  They had us sit in the heated patio section - but the heaters weren't working so we were freezing the entire time and they had their door wide open. It was raining and cold last night and the whole atmosphere was terrible as a result.  I was hoping the food would make up for the misery of the restaurant - but it was completely disappointing.  We ordered many items (chorizo, cheese, kitchen bread, blood sausage, octopus, croquettes, beef tenderloin) and the only thing that stood out was the salt.  The dishes were either completely forgettable or over powered with salt.  There wasn't a single item that I thought I'd want to go back for. In fact, I have a reservation at Bar Isabel in two weeks and am going to cancel it since I've heard the two restaurants are similar. I have no desire to eat their food again.  If you're looking for a really good meal, this definitely is not the place. If you're looking for a place to \"see and be seen\" and the food and atmosphere is secondary - give it a try."}
{"text":"Great tapas and pintxos experience. Tried fino and amontillado sherries with hot octopus, conjunado (small sandwich with fried quail egg), boquerones (white anchovies and olives), tomato bread and croquettes. Delicious and what it is supposed to be. Great atmosphere and fun place for a quick drink and snack. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a friend's birthday mid-work week.  I will start off by commenting on the food.  No doubt, it was good food.  It wasn't mind-blowing, as in, I need to come back here soon, but solid taste and quality.  Apart from the food, the interior design is fantastic. The wood shapes remind me so much of Gaudi design - it was quite impressive.  The reasons why I rated this a 3-star was the service and the 'standing while eating' factor.  The service was very... I don't even know what words to use... blah and unfriendly, as if a robot could have done an equal job. Granted, the service was prompt, so not all bad.  Lastly, the fact that we had to stand the entire time to eat our food was a pretty big turnoff for me.  The indoor space is tight so I was bumped for the 2 hours that we were there.  Perhaps I was under the wrong impression before going, but I guess it is what it is... but simply not a place that I would rush to again.  It definitely has its strong points and I don't deny that!  Raval is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"They've done a good job of creating a Spanish tapas bar in Toronto as far as I can tell.   Convenient that it's open from 8AM on, which means you don't have to fight to find a spot to try it in the evening (like at Bar Isabel). There are few seats (so don't go planning to get too comfortable).   Try to do some research on the menu items before you go...there are no descriptions so you're probably not going to know what anything is, and if it is busy you won't have an opportunity to get someone to explain it all to you. Probably can't go wrong with anything you order, though. Top notch cocktails."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks back with my boyfriend to meet friends for a birthday dinner and I was really dissapointed by the service. To be honest I went once before and had a blast but there weren't many people there so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. This time was different, it was quite busy but we waited to sit on the patio and were ignored basically for the first 30 mins. We finally were attended to and the person kind of gave us a bit of attitude. We eventually were served, the food was mediocre...our bill was $500. At least if we had good service we maybe would not have noticed the bill but the two combined made for a bad experience. I don't think I'll come back - I do like Bar Isabel though. ..totally different  vibe"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie I felt a little awkward when I first walked in into the bar. I tried to find a spot where to stand so that I wouldn't look too uncool. The fact that it was a Monday (industry night)  and a bunch of super hip  chefs were crowding the bar didn't help.  Soon enough a couple of spots opened up and I was able to finally get to the good part The food! Basically everything with quail eggs on it is a  winner in my books.The Octopus on crostini was great and so were the Salchichas. The cocktails could improve in presentation and level of boozines. I would like to go back when all the hype has died down a bit."}
{"text":"I went to bar raval on a Friday night. Thankfully it wasn't that packed so we only had to wait about 15 minutes. There's a covered patio section where you can order drinks before you get a table inside the restaurant. I had forgotten was that inside the bar there were no chairs!! There were only a few floating stools on a first come first serve basis. TBH after a long day at work, all I wanted to do was sit .... so we were on the lookout for stools. Besides the no actual seat idea, the menu selection was great. Tons of tapas and great Spanish wine list with a wide variety. I remembered last time that I came to Bar Ravel the food was really good. I decided to try some of their other dishes and this time I was not blown away by their flavours. We ordered the fresh anchovies , garlician octopus, fried eggplant and honey, monkfish special. The garlician octopus came as thinly sliced and covered w some toppings. Flavours were okay but lacking something. The fresh anchovies were quite fresh and salty as they should be, but I wish it came with some croquettes or a baguette.  Kind of overpriced for 5 anchovies and 6 olives. :/ The almond sauce that came with the monkfish special was pretty delicious but I think the monkfish was pretty soft (as it should be because it was sous vide'd) but the flavours didn't blow me away.  The best dish from tonight was the fried eggplant and honey. The eggplants are apparently soaked in milk overnight then crusted and fried. It was so light and tasty!! Maybe I'm biased because I like eggplant as well. Anyway overall tonight's dinner was OK. The ambiance was great and there was a great vibe go on inside. Drinks were great and they had a wide selection of cocktails. Overall, I probably won't be coming back until half a year or a year later. Hopefully they'll have a lot more tasty dishes then !"}
{"text":"The room is great. So is the product: drinks and food. The service though, save for one bartender on one night and one barista who I know and so I am biased because I know them, is embarrassingly bad. The host didn't know anything about the menu, I only asked a few basic questions. Every time I go in there, no one is ever smiling. They don't offer water, you have to ask. And as Tom Waits said, you couldn't find a server with a Geiger counter.   I had 3 slow, inattentive, and altogether absent service experiences in a row. I wrote in twice. Got no response. They're raking in the dough so who cares, right?   This beginning to be endemic in Toronto. I'd rather go next door to Woodlot and be treated like a person who is paying money for great food, drinks, AND great service."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Barcelona, you're walking into familiar territory at Bar Raval. Beautiful decor with Gaudi-esque wood paneling and a warm ambiance. There are a few barrels that act as bar tables throughout the joint, but no sit-down dinner spots. The style of the bar goes hand in hand with the type of food they have...able to one handedly chow down. Our cocktails were delicious, the food was oily and full of meaty flavour - just the way it was in Barcelona. This was the first time I tried blood sausage and it was a win! The service was very friendly and we had numerous questions about the menu, all of which were extensively answered. Thanks Bar Raval!"}
{"text":"AmaZing tapas and wine!! Love the croquettes! And the shrimp with romesco sauce is devine! Mostly only standing room but our waiter got us two bar stools. Service was excellent! And don't forget to have the cheesecake! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Food: 10/10 Atmosphere: 9/10  Service: 8.5/10 Overall experience: 9.5/10  Just blocks down from Bar Isabel, and steps away from La Carnita and DaiLo, Bar Raval manages to stand out amongst these other gems in Little Italy.  For breakfast, they have multiple dishes on display at the bar. All of them are available for order, and it makes it easier if you're not sure how to navigate the menu.  We had: - pintxos (Morcilla and Quail egg) - a slice of baguette with meat, a pepper (I believe) topped with a fried quail's egg - pintxos (Galician Octopus)  - Lomo Bellota - a cured meat  There were other dishes that I couldn't find on the online menu - a cheese that had been soaked in red wine, croquettes that were filled with this clam chowder like substance, and the mushroom tower (three mushrooms, a shrimp on top all on this buttery baguette).   All the dishes were extremely punchy. It was as if they were making up for their small size. Fine by me as the flavours were bright and bold!  You will see by the photos and every other review, that the interior is very cool and unique. Woodwork is present throughout the whole restaurant. Barrels stand in the middle of the floor for your to gather round and put your drinks on.   The service was good/normal. I think our waitress may have been still feeling the effects of her drinking the other night (we went on Sunday morning) but she had a great attitude and made some helpful recommendations.   THE BOTTOM LINE: truly fantastic food that stands out in an area with already great restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was not great, and the service was horrible. There are many other choices for tapas in Toronto... Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Always a favourite! Cocktails amazing - props to the ever changing, always impressive drink menu!!"}
{"text":"Nice, but did not meet expectations.  Some of the items we had were really not good, and based on the reviews and reputation I would have expected everything to be excellent.  But some dishes kind of sucked.  Foie with rhubarb was greasy and a waste of foie.  Morcilla with egg was too salty and also greasy.  Stick with the simplest possible things (cheeses, ham, pickles) and you're better off.  Every \"creative\" item we ordered was bad."}
{"text":"Great bar.   Upon arrival there is a bouncer who can only let you know if you're on the list or be put on the list. He allows you to sit/stand in the patio area, which right now is covered and heated since it is winter. Once they are inside to seat you inside they will come and get you.  The minute you come in the first thing you notice is the design of the interior. It has this Gaudi feel to it. Those who have been to Barcelona would understand Gaudi's work.   The ambiance is great. Loud, dark, comforting.   The lighting of the bar helps illuminate the atmosphere a bit.  Food wise, it was ok. Nothing special. If you've been to Spain then you will never get the same type of tapas food as you would get there. But this will do for now.  Their drinks are awesome. Very unique and flavorful. I think i had a little too much of it.  I came here to bring my buddy from Boston. He enjoyed it and made a Vlog about it. Enjoy!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVC1C3ixQJ8"}
{"text":"Great staff and love the wooden design and decor! And the heated patio was great. They also make a mean cocktail - definitely recommend, the food also looked fantastic, will come back to try it soon!!"}
{"text":"Well, it really depends what you are looking for. Bar Raval has been ranked as the hippest bar in downtown Toronto. I like the vibes, the food (apparently, very authentic according to my Spanish teacher) and drinks. The decor definitely is a bonus. The downsides of this place are 1. A a bit of wait (the restaurant does offer patio where you can wait for your seats and get a drink in the meantime), 2. The price (we spent around 55 per person without really getting a full meal, but I did get a bottle of cider and a cocktail per person). Compared to other bars, cocktails here cost at least 14 dollars and can go up to 20 bucks. That is pretty much as much as a drink can cost in the core downtown. For this reason, I do find the drinks are a bit overpriced.   Next time, I will probably come here only for a drink, just like a lot of people do. However, if you are less price sensitive, I think it is a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"Everything about this place just works. From the food to the service to the ambience, everything was great. We went on a Thursday night at 6 and were able to grab a table outside right away. It was the perfect weather for sidewalk seating and much less crowded than inside, which seemed to be mostly standing tables and bar service.   Our host and waiter were friendly and very accommodating. They were able to answer our questions and they gave great suggestions. It was our first time there so we played it safe, but every dish was amazing. The olives weren't the overly salted variety you find most places, which I really appreciated. The tomato bread was so fresh and cleansing to the palate. The mushroom towers were juicy and delicious. The murcia al vino goat cheese and chorizo were a perfect pairing, and we just devoured the half bread with it all.   Their cocktails are apparently fantastic, but also try their tea. The black tea had a hint of caramelized sugar even before I added anything to it, and it was amazing. And the basque cheesecake. There was moaning at the table. I'm just saying.   I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here because I love their sister restaurant Bar Isabel, but was immediately put off by the host. This guy was the ultimate jerk, who hired him?? It was our first time here so we were trying to understand the whole concept and just asked him some friendly questions, but he was extremely rude and condescending.   We decided to stick around and try the food because this chef is one of my favourites. We tried a little bit of everything on the menu because we were a group of 4, and the shrimp was my favourite. The cocktails were also amazing, you can't go wrong with anything you order!   I can't give this place 5 stars because of 1) the rude host and 2) I really hate the standing concept even though I know that's the whole point lol. If you're looking to have a dinner with a group of friends to sit down and chat, this is not the place. If you're going as a party of 2 for a mix of drinks and good food, just be sure to wear comfortable shoes!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval, quite possibly my favourite bar in Toronto!  Ana is my favourite bartender, she elevates the experience to a different level.  I love her drinks, I don't bother ordering off the menu I just get her to make something off the cuff with whatever liquor I'm feeling.  She is super talented, passionate and works like an artist; seamlessly mixing cocktail after cocktail with her own personal flair. She takes the place from 4 to a perfect 5 start rating.  Alongside the drinks; the food is excellent as well.  The tapas plates are made to order and served hot straight out of the kitchen (which is viewable from the bar) the croquettes are my must-have every time I go.  Everything else I've tried is equally as tantalizing from the hot octopus to the shishito peppers and steak to the wild mushrooms in oloroso.   To note; I personally don't always order the pintxos as the bread is sometimes tough making it hard to eat without a bit of a mess.    Most of the tapas items average around $8-$15 which is good value, in my opinion, compared to a lot of other hot Spanish tapas spots in the city.  It can be hard to get in on Friday and Saturday nights.  The doorman is very nice and tries his best to accommodate everyone but keep in mind it is a small space and you're never guaranteed to get in but once you're in you know it's going to be a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint. Beautiful interior, attentive staff, cocktails were out of this world! Started with a \"hambourgesa\" and shishito pepper and they were so good we kept ordering more! The small plates were easily split between myself and my two friends so we could try a little of everything. This place is not to miss!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to grab a drink and snacks pre-dinner. We arrived just before 6:00pm on Friday night. There were still a couple of places inside but it was quite crowded so we chose to stand in their heated patio. We ordered 2 drinks. The tinto fino and the sundowner. Both were fantastic. We also ordered the Serrano jamon, manchego, an order of bread and the croquetas. Every item was delicious. Definitely a nice place to check out with some friends."}
{"text":"An absolute surprise of a restaurant. To start, the restaurant is small and quite cramped, and unfortunately don't have any actual sit down tables. There are standing spots all around and a few stools here and there by the bar.  Despite this, I had some great food and a great time here.  As a group, we've had to huddle around a makeshift barrel table, and our waitress suggested a few popular items for our group of 7 to try. We had a total of 9 dishes and though each dish look tiny, we were all quite full.  In particular, the pork cheeks, octopus, and fried eggplants are amazing.  Great sharing sizes despite the small dishes.  I did not particularly like tomato paste on toast in comparison.  Our waiters/waitresses were very knowledgeable and talked about each dish with such details that you want to try everything.  The atmosphere is cramped but very lively, great for a small group or a date.  The menu is large enough but not overwhelmingly so that you don't know what to order.    10/10 would try again!"}
{"text":"1 hour 45 minute wait.  Over crowded Stand up only at a minuscule counter Very grumpy rude waiter Underwhelming food Lousy drink  I think that's it."}
{"text":"An awesome tapas bar! Came here yesterday for dinner and really enjoyed the food. It wasn't busy last night so we were able to get a bar table at the back. The other tables are standing tables so not sure if I would recommend this place for groups. But it's a definite must-try if you're going in groups of two and want to try great tapas food.  There's a lot going on in the menu, so we went with the waitress's recommendation. The stracciatella & boquerones were the highlight of the night. The taste of the salty anchovies paired with the cheese and zesty sauce was so yummy. If you're coming here, definitely try these! Also try the serrano jamon (dry-cured ham) with the murcia al vino goat cheese. These two paired really well. The hot octopus was also really delicious. Wasn't a fan of the lamb sausage and tomato bread; tasted like something I could makes at home. The pork ribs were average. I mean the taste was magnificent but it had very little meat on the bone. Not sure if I would be getting these next visit.   Overall, a great tapas bar if you're looking to come on a date or in groups of two. Will definitely be coming back to try some of the clams and other cured meats."}
{"text":"Deeelicious. Service was excellent, food was incredible, presentation was beautiful and overall a great location.  Just make sure you get there early to get good seats - it's a tight space and gets full easily.   Had a great time on the patio seating. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was great*    Atmosphere was good we sat outside* and food was different in an amazing surprise* ask the waitress for recommendations if you are adventurous*"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try Bar Raval as it had been on my list for the longest time. We came around 5:30pm and it was already pretty packed, but we scored corner seating. Normally, I would worry about sitting in corner seats, especially with our backs to everyone and the entire place, but this felt secluded and we didn't really have to flag anyone down for service.  We got:  Canned razor clams from Spain. I've never had razor clams, but I didn't really think there was anything special with this as it was just razor clams and the water it was canned in.  Smoked mackerel. This was so good. Preserved in-house, it melts in your mouth with smoky flavour and rosemary oil.  Cojunado was a second favourite and the more substantial pintxos we ordered. A sunny-side up quail egg, sweet piquillo pepper, chorizo, thick bacon and parsley oil all on a slice of baguette. So darn good.  Mushroom and oloroso. The beauty of mushroom is that it soaks up the flavours of whatever it's cooked in and with. However, the oloroso (sherry) didn't overpower the flavour of the wild mushrooms.   Hot octopus was good too with olive oil and paprika. it also had potatoes in there too.   Pricey yes, but the dishes were delicious and the ambiance makes you feel like you are in Spain."}
{"text":"This place is outrageously expensive and the few dishes we tried (octopus a la plancha, fried eggplant, tomato bread, tuna white bean salad, and chorizo con queso) were nothing special. With the exception of the eggplant, things were salty and overdone. Usually I love tapas and typically don't mind paying a high price for good quality, but this was a real bummer."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I did like the food but it was pretty expensive.  Good atmosphere and vibe. People are showing up and they do keep a good standard in terms of quality. Maybe it's just me but after doing many trips to Europe, I still have trouble stomaching the bill for what you get."}
{"text":"Delicious! The kitchen bread was amazing and the Vina Olabarri red wine by the glass was great. Definitely worth going with friends!"}
{"text":"This was our first food stop during our vacation in Toronto, and it was definitely one of the best. We found a nice spot on the patio, watched the sunset, and had some food and drink. I forget what they called it, but I had some vermouth with club soda, and it was quite refreshing on an unusually humid night. My husband had the Goldeneye and it hit the spot for him.   We went through the excellent menu of tapas and pintxos, and finally settled on a few things. The jamon and manchego arrived first, classic and delicious. We also enjoyed the sockeye salmon tartare (another thing perfect for a summer night; the mint made this especially nice) and the hearty and inventive cojunado (an eggy, hammy, chorizo-y delight that is so large that it's definitely broadening the definition of pinxto).   The service was relaxed but friendly, and the prices seemed fair given the quality of the food. What a lovely way to start the trip!"}
{"text":"C'est l'un des nouveaux endroits tendance de Toronto. SI vous n'avez essayé les bar à tapas, assez peu courant en Amérique du Nord, alors allez faire un tour au bar Raval. Comptez quand même 45 min à 1h d'attente avant de pouvoir avoir un spot et j'entends par là un tonneau ou vous êtes debout en cercle afin d'y déguster vos tapas.  Exemple de prix : à 3 personnes, on a commandé 9 tapas et 3 bières et on s'en est sortis pour 150$. Excessif me diront certains mais on paie pour la qualité. Le cadre et le décor du bar méritent d'êtres soulignés."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - a good chance to try / share lot's of different tapas style dishes with friends.   I was lucky to score a patio seat out front but I arrived early at 4pm. Inside is crazy crowded. It's small and mostly standing room. I would have probably rated less if I was stuck inside with the standing crowd.   Wine, cocktails and 4 beers on the drink list. Something for everyone but largely the basics in each category. I would not come for drinks alone.   The food is worth the trip - some really interesting and unique dishes to try. A quick run down:  - Gooseneck barnacles. Waiter spent about 5 minutes explaining how to eat these little guys. Look out, they shoot juice everywhere. My eyes, hair, shirt and jacket. WTF, ultimately not worth the trouble in my opinion but a load of fun for the table. Tastes like a combo of shrimp/lobster.   - Foie Gras toast. I'm not the biggest foie gras fan but this dish was excellent - the best of the night. A cherry vinageur spread on the toast made it taste a little like Peanut butter and jam toast.   - Scallops in Uni sauce. What is not to like here. Fresh scallops with a hint of Uni. They give you bread on the side to soak up the Uni sauce :)   - Razor Clams - I'm not a big clam fan so not going to rate but my friend liked it. $26 feels high for this small item... But what do I know?   - Chorizo. Nice flavor, cut in thicker than average pieces. Worth trying.  - Kitchen Bread. Two pieces of crusty bread with Mayo, roasted red pepper and anchovies. Good combo but definitely too much mayo. We used our knives to remove half the mayo at least.   Come willing to experiment. Have fun, try lots of different things. Service was good. I will return to try more of the menu.   BK"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! But why did I just give it 4 out of 5 stars? I was not too happy with the customer service that I received.  The food was amazing... We had to wait for an hour to get a seat...the doorman or security (not sure which one he was) was really nice and managed to get us a spot as fast as he could...there were alot of people and it was really dark inside too. I would suggest the restaurant to lower down their music volume so you can talk to the person/people that are with you. I literally was yelling to speak to my friend which was pretty annoying. The seats are uncomfortable and the there should be more space, so if you need alot of space to eat, then this place might not be great for you. Atmosphere was nice though.   I had different food items (forgot the names)  but I do remember trying the duck liver which was amazing (It was my first time) It was very fatty and had a lot of flavour. Literally melted in your mouth!  Bar Raval would have deserved the last star but the waitress was not friendly...So not too happy with that. I feel that customer service is very important in a restaurant so they definitely need to improve on that."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. I like the tapa-style menu, and we were there on a day in which they were going with the raw seafood theme.  We went with it - and it was pretty damn good. The sardines on french bread was amazing, and the shrimp was nice.  The highlight was definitely the donut - one of the best I've ever had. Made in-house, absolutely fluffy, light, and delicious. Not too sweet, not too fried. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"It is probably the best dinner I have ever had. I would visite there again. Also nice outdoor patio"}
{"text":"This is a very trendy spot, that is definitely worth checking out! But I assure you, it's not for everyone. They have a very contemporary small plate menu, which may be difficult to comprehend for the less adventurous (think house-made canned fish). Fortunately, the wait-staff are exceptional at explaining what each dish is, and they have no problem making modifications if need be (vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free). Also, ask them for any wine or drink suggestions to be paired with the collective dishes and they'd be more than happy to help. The decor is what's so great about this place and sets it aside from other restaurants offering small or tapas style plates. Almost like a bee-hive effect engrained in the wood, dim lighting and intimate seating. If you have an issue with standing while dining, or sitting around small-tall tables this place may not be for you."}
{"text":"Who would've thought you'd get food served from a can when it costs $18-$36 dollars on a menu? But I gotta say those clams, scalaps and makarel were pretty damn tasty.   Kinda wanted to take some home myself but I don't think it would feel the same lol.   Time to fly to Spain and bring some home myself instead.....  My fave was still the hot octopus dish though...I can never get enough of octopus especially when it is done well!  Drinks were alright...not a big fan of the cocktails but maybe i just didn't pick the right ones for myself.  The wait time for me was about 1 hr to get to the heated patio on a Saturday night from 1030pm.  Then we got to move into the main restaurant about another hour later.   Service was good.  Waiter and waitress were nice and patient.  They seemed nicer as the night progressed though lol.....hmm  All in all, great vibe at this place...sucks to have to wait but I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Great experience here. The food was delicious, DELICIOUS! Friendly service, love being able to eat at off hours. Great atmosphere--very casual, very warm, very professionally run. I will definitely be back. The kitchen bread was outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"Why is this place so darn good ! Small always busy but cosy and lively. Absolute looooove the Gaudi inspired interior. The selection of Spanish tapas is unique and interesting and every cocktail that comes off that bar looks so delicious. I'd easily rate it one of the best bars in Toronto for a bite and drink on any given night !"}
{"text":"Some local friends took me here for a late lunch and sneaky drink on a sunny afternoon, and we'll put it out there- they nailed it.  Bar Raval is hands down one of the most beautiful bars I've ever been in, literally. Drawing inspiration from Gaudi, and in partnership with a local Toronto design agency, the bar is filled with curves of carved wood and feels like Barcelona.  The food is small tapas, everything was delicious and serves were reasonable, but if you are looking for a giant meal it could get pricy. Most unexpectedly delicious item ordered was the mushroom tower- not something I would usually order but they were garlicky and lemony and I'm legit drooling not just thinking about it. The drinks menu is also great- we tried a few of the house specials of vermouth with cava, which went down great.  Staff were delightful and very helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite cocktail bar in Toronto. There is usually a wait but both the food and drinks are worth it!"}
{"text":"We came here at around 6:30pm on a Saturday night after checking out a few places during the Doors Open Toronto weekend. As we stood by the bar, pondering over the menu, 2 seats freed up by the window. We quickly sat down, and a waiter came by shortly after to take our orders.  The experience was quite authentic as it really reminded us of the tapas restaurants we visited in Spain a few years back. I particularly liked the Gaudi inspired decor, which was unique and whimsical.   We ordered some bread ($3.5) to dip into the tasty oils and sauces from the other dishes. I enjoyed the plump olives ($7) as they were meaty, slightly salty with a good balance of sweet and sour.    The classic Jamon Croquetas ($8) were delicious and melted right in our mouths. These lightly battered fritters and the oozing creamy bechamel with cured ham really hit the spot.   The star of the Octopus a la planxa ($14.25) in my opinion is the spiced oil. It was fragrant and packed with so much flavour, we couldn't stop dipping our bread in it. The octopus was tender and the potatoes went well with the dish, but overall, you can put pretty much put anything in that spiced oil and it would have tasted good!  The Chorizo Sausage ($9.50) was a tad too spicy for me, so my husband ate the majority of it. I did enjoy the sweet red peppers on the side though.  The Squid, Artichokes and Romesco ($16) was tasty, and I particularly enjoyed the romesco, as the flavours were very balanced and it went well with the perfectly cooked squid and artichokes.   Since Bar Raval is also known for their cocktails, I opted for the Palm Springs Pawn Shop ($15) instead of wine, which is my usual choice. I wasn't a big fan of the drink and would prefer the cocktails at Bar Isabel.   Overall, we enjoyed the food here, although I do find the prices to be a bit high for the amount you get. However, given the great flavours and execution, I wouldn't mind returning when I am craving for some good Spanish tapas. Unfortunately, this place does not accept reservations and it does get pretty busy, so do come early or avoid the weekends if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Not your average spanish tapas.  The atmosphere encourages standing (only a few stools) and hence, mingling.  Small spot nestled between woodlot and la carnita are sure to give them both some good competition.  Wood bar is beautiful and half lined with various off-the-menu pintxos and pastries.    Menu ranges from cured spanish meats, canned seafood, to freshly made pintxos.  Highlights for me were the blood sausage+baguette and the pig cheek, but everything was impressive.  A fair amount of options and you'll be asking a lot of questions as the menu items are mostly in Spanish.  Cocktails were light but delicious.  There is no doubt in my mind that this place will be a hit.  You can walk in there and have a spanish coffee and sandwich for $10, or spend $100+ on various tapas and cocktails.  The ambiance is a no-pressure, \"find your own spot\" type of vibe, where you may be rubbing elbows with your neighbour.  I personally think this is even better than Bar Isabel."}
{"text":"beautiful atmosphere and great food! This is a must try for foodies and young people looking for a new experience!"}
{"text":"I was pretty late to game in checking out the much hyped Bar Raval. Every time I was around College and Bathurst and might have stopped by for a drink or bite it seemed like too much of a production and I sensed some pretension. There are other good options around Bar Raval.  I finally tried it when meeting up with a friend a few months ago. It was as lively as you would expect. Definitely haven't tried everything, but highlights included smoked mackerel (served in a cute tin) and the hot octopus. There is tons of herbed olive oil that comes with most of these dishes which acts as a nice bread dip. I also enjoyed what we had from the raw bar.  I wasn't liking the social scene when I was there, but I cannot deny the stunning space and good food."}
{"text":"Cool spanish bar to check out if you want good food along with nicely made drinks! I ordered the octopus, straciatella, tomato bread to accompany my drinks and I can say that each one tasted really different and great.  Be prepared to wait because this place can get packed!"}
{"text":"Horrible hipster service. Been here twice gets worst every time. I don't see what all the rave is about. Beautiful architecture by the fools that recently designed the 13k bong. I see why all the back lash is telling them to stick to what they know- design interiors. Anyway back to the food. So so expensive. Tiny portions. Nose turned up service. Everything is on bread and covered in oil. Cut a few pieces of thin ham and open a few cans of stuff they didn't cook. Very rude servers that pretend they don't see you fighting for attention. Cooks are extremely loud in the kitchen can hear them swearing. Not so happy to bring my nephew there. I would not recommend. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Loved the vibe, wooden accents and moody amber lighting inside Bar Raval. Feels like I'm transported to another place! Mostly standing-only with a few bar stools (which we were lucky to score). Casual, friendly, refined and welcoming. It was buzzing and lively on a Tuesday evening - my cousin waited in line for half an hour before she was able to get in - they don't take reservations.  Food: Ordered two cocktails, and split 4 appetizers between the two of us. We went on a Tuesday evening. made all the right food choices: mixed kale salad, mushroom tower, octopus and squid. You have to try them all!  Service: Attentive and friendly, prompt and courteous. No complaints!  Overall Verdict:  Food and drinks are a bit on the pricier side but it's worth it to indulge from time to time. Cocktails are generous with the alcohol content and you can definitely taste the booze! Bring a friend or two, socialize with the other patrons (it's definitely an environment that encourages it, based on its room setup and intimate vibe), and have fun on a weeknight- no need to wait for the weekend - it's packed full of people everyday!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed getting to try several things in solo portions which was nice of them to offer. The morcilla and egg and the croquet as were my favourite. The interior design is outstanding, very maritime like feel. They do a great job of creating a basque type of feel with the open windows as well. I look forward to returning"}
{"text":"Bar Raval is one of my favourite spots. It's a great place for lunch with friends or a night out for snacks and drinks. The vibe is much more casual than its sister restaurant Bar Isabel and is mostly standing room at bar tops, especially if you come at night. I think some people don't like this, but I've spent a lot of time in Spain and a lot of tapas bars there are usually standing only so I quite enjoy it. There's a small patio during the warmer months but the interior is gorgeous, full of warm curvy wood that looks like it was inspired by the Spanish architect, Gaudi.  Now on to the food! They have a tapas menu so expect smaller dishes. Your best bet is to order several and share with your friends. I always order their tomato bread, a simple dish of great bread and a generous amount of crushed tomatoes. Their croquetas are perfectly fried, light and delicious. Their pintxos (crostinis) are all great, try the boquerones which is a cured white fish or their morcella (blood sausage) and egg. The hot octopus is great too, and is usually order some plain bread to dip and sop up the oil. They change up their menu occasionally and a few weeks ago I had a grilled squid over squid ink rice that was super delicious! They have some cured meats, cheese and premium canned seafood imported from Spain as well but I tend to stick to the hot items. Although if you've never had jamon iberico or manchego cheese, you should definitely give them a try. And don't forget to save some room for their basque cheesecake for dessert! It's creamy and slightly lighter than American style and it's my favourite cheesecake! They have some unique beers, a good selection of wines and usually a few ciders. There's also some standard coffee based drinks as well.  Additional to their regular menu, they always have some pastries and mini sandwiches along their bar as well so it's great for brunch on the weekend as well. Their donuts are so good! It doesn't seem to have the same brunch line up craze as a lot of Toronto hot spots which is a bonus. My guess is maybe it's due to how their menu is still their regular tapas style menu instead of classic brunch plates with your usual egg and pancakes options."}
{"text":"We only just dropped in and grabbed a couple of donuts and a rhubarb pastry on our way to have an outdoor coffee elsewhere (a confession - we wanted a big old cup of drip coffee because we were thirsty and also philistines) but those treats were awesome. The rhubarb thingy was like the best rhubarb pie ever and the chocolate donuts with candied orange peels was exceptional. As far as fancy treats go these are worth it. I think there are far too many places putting the fancy pants on the (dare I say) 'humble' donut, with mixed results. But whoever is making these dainties is making them with love and understanding.     And the place looks amazing. Maybe we will stick around and sip some tiny coffees with our treats next time round."}
{"text":"Whoa! This place not only serves up awesome food, but transports you to another world.   The interior looks like a set from Lord of the Rings. Its incredibly beautiful, and unlike anything you are likely to see outside of Disneyland.   The style of the food and service is so different, with small menus at the table, and a constantly changing layout of food at the bar that you can order as they come out.   The food is a bit on the expensive side, but you never feel cheated because the portions are decent, compared to some of the other tapas places in the city that really feel like you are being taken for a ride.   All the canned smoked meats are awesome, especially the mackerel. And the cheesecake is surprisingly awesome.   I got to try more than half the menu, and nothing disappointed. I will definitely be returning for the fascinating dinning experience."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, drinks are a bit pricey considering its in like a plastic child sized cup..  But looooooved the food  Its unique, small portion but very tasty  On a nice sunny day, their patio is where id want to be .  Loved it. Will be back as soon as i can"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and tapas! We had cocktails and decided to try the kitchen bread (roasted red pepper, anchovies, and garlic mayo), octopus (served cold with green pepper and olive oil), and cured beef. The former two were fantastic. Service was great. Atmosphere was cute, airy, and buzzing (the staff does a good job of keeping the place from getting overcrowded). Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval is a busy newish Spanish pinxtos/tapas bar in the heart of Little Italy, Toronto.  Most notable is the inviting Catalan styled decor that makes one feel warm and comfortable in a standing room only interior.   Much like the social bar culture of northern Spain, the atmosphere is permeated with a festive social crowd in their 20's - 40's intent on catching up while both eating and drinking.  We went on a busy Friday night after 8pm and the wait was about 55 minutes to get in (we spent the wait time elsewhere).  However, bar Raval is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  When we were finally called back to the restaurant, we had a few different pinxtos and tapas.  What we liked best was the: \"A la Parilla Octopus\", \"Anchoas', and \"Tomato Bread\".  Our only sore point: we had a variety of cocktail drinks, and although they were interesting enough we couldn't really taste the alcohol, nor sadly did we get wasted."}
{"text":"We were just in Toronto for the wknd, and heard good things. They have a small patio area that is heated and covered with barrels as tables and while there are no actual seats there was NO WAIT at 9 on a Saturday night, while there was a 2 hour wait for the bar. The small plates live up to the hype, everything we tried was delicious! We had the straticella, pork chop/shishito peppers, croquetas, kitchen bread and hot octopus--all of which were lovely. The chop was substantially bigger than anything else we ordered, and this was a perfect amt of food for two people. I cant even comment on favorites bc I would order it all again! Also, our waitress was super helpful and enthusiastic about the menu, she made wonderful recommendations. Cocktails were excellent and well balanced, service was quick paced and very professional. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval is a great place for afterwork drinks or a pitstop during a night out. This trendy little bar is brought to you by the people that brought you Bar Isabel (one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto). The vibe of the bar is great. The bar reminds me of a Barcelona tavern. The design of the wood bar reminds me of some of Gaudi's work in Barcelona.  The cocktails at Bar Raval were delicious. The appetizers and tapas were not bad, but a bit pricey for the quality and portions you are getting. For this reason, I would recommend Bar Raval as a place to go for drinks rather than food. This is also the reason Bar Raval is only getting 3 stars instead of 5. The disconnect between the pricing and the value you are getting from the food is the reason I deducted 2 stars.  The bar is also pretty small and space is limited. If you go on the weekends, there may only be standing room only."}
{"text":"Cool interior and really nice staff. But authentic Pintxos/tapas, far from anything you would enjoy in San Sebastian let alone El Raval district of Barcelona. First off, the cold pintxos/tapas should be on display and self-serve and the warm/hot dishes should also be on display so you can see what to order from your roaming server.  Second, where was the Txakoli, sparkling white wine poured from a height into a glass to create more bubbles and/or beer from Spain. I'm not going to be too harsh on Bar Raval as I believe their is an intent to not be authentic. But really folks, several slices of chorizo on a side plate isn't a tapas or a pintxos so let's not say this is anywhere close to a tapas/pintxos bar. IMO, Bar Raval is different for Toronto and that is a very good thing and should a few tweaks be applied it may become a real stand-out,.But there is no vibe once inside which should be pulsating, alive like a heartbeat with music.conversation and lots of non-aggressive Olé`s. Oh and a few crazy moments from the bar staff to keep the place hopping."}
{"text":"Dropped in here on a Saturday morning, hoping to introduce my partner to the almond doughnut I loved so much on my last visit. They didn't have that one, but we didn't leave empty-handed, and picked out a trio of baked goodies to go. I love that they display the baked wares on plates and trays along the bar. It makes it easy to choose -- and hard to resist choosing them all. There are savories on the bar, too, like croissant sandwiches with smoked salmon or jamón.  Back to the pastries. We got that day's special doughnut - chocolate with candied orange - as well as a pistachio cream-filled creation with lemon glaze, AND a rhubarb tart. IMO, this is the only place in town that gets doughnuts really really really really right (the dough should be a bit greasy), and the chocolate candied orange combination was truly outstanding. (I'm not really a fan of candied orange or the choco-orange blend, and this was just a star match, perfectly balanced textures and tastes.) The other two were stand-outs too, beautifully put together.  In short: Raval's pastry-making, ingredients and ideas are in a class of their own."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on the heels of a number of fabulous reviews. Many of the reviewers comment on the decor, which I'm sure is good, but we sat on the patio, so I can't comment.  We ordered nearly every item on the menu, tapas style, and concluded that all items were decent, but very forgettable.  Nit a single item would warrant a return visit.  The service was decent and quick despite how busy the place is."}
{"text":"Great tapas and cocktails. Perfect for a date night or a girls night out. The only drawback is that there's only a few bar stools and you may have to stay standing up for hours."}
{"text":"Arrive early as it can get packed if you want to hang inside the bar. But hey, its summer, a little patio time outside wouldnt hurt. So enjoy it. The drink menu is pretty good, lots to choose from ... but prices are pretty expensive so expect to spend if you want to come here with a group. They also offer some finger foods if you like. The fois Gras on toast was tasty."}
{"text":"Small shop by Bathurst and College serving up solid Spanish tapas. With minimal seating available, the restaurant boasts a casual and laid-back environment where you can stand around high tables or self-serve and find a seat by the bar. Paired with a wide selection of finger foods, this is the place to hang back and snack away!   I came here on a weekend at 2pm (off peak hours) and was able to grab a seat rather quickly. I've heard it's harder to find seating during peak hours, and since Bar Raval doesn't accept reservations, come early or at your own risk during busier times.   Between two people, we shared 6 appetizers which was enough to stuff us: - Mackerel - Pork Shank and Salsa Verde - Mushroom Tower - Octopus a la Planxa - Straciatella and Boquerones  - Hamburguesa  Our favorite was the Straciatella and Boquerones, and the Mackerel. Both options were nicely flavored and seasoned, and served with fresh bread. The pork shank and hamburguesa were a bit too salty for us, so we preferred the seafood choices.   Overall, a lovely place with fabulous decor - felt like I was teleported to Gaudi's hideaway in Barcelona!"}
{"text":"The service here was incredibly slow and the waitress surly and rude.  I had to ask for water four different times to actually get one small glass of it.  Our drinks came 45 minutes after we ordered them, and when most of our food was gone, with no explanation from the surly waitress. The food ranged from horrible (cold, clearly store bought olives) to somewhat tasty (mushroom tower and tomato bread) but everything was slow to come to the table and served in a disorganized way. After our waitress presented us with the bill, she never came back, so finally we just threw some cash on the table and left. Maybe people mainly come here for the drinks, and my drink was good, but if you want food there are much better choices."}
{"text":"Absolutely STUNNING interior - I've never seen anything like it. I love Spanish cuisine and food culture, so it wasn't just the cool wooden ceiling that drew me to this place. My boyfriend and I stopped by Bar Raval in the morning, so it was too early for tapas - thankfully they offer coffee and doughnuts! We ordered the Cortado and the Cafe Solo, which were both delicious and strong; you'd be hard-pressed to find coffees like this outside of Europe. We also got the Dulce de Leche y Jamon and Crema Catalana doughnuts. I LOVED the jamon on the Dulce de Leche doughnut and how well it paired with the glaze. It was a tiny bit stale, but that was probably because it had been sitting on the counter for a couple hours. No worries though, because it was awesome. The Crema Catalana pastry was also very good, with a cream filled centre that tasted homemade.   I can't wait to come back and try some of their drinks and tapas!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this gem. The first time I visited with New York friends we were greeted and made comfortable, instantly. After a steady procession of cocktails, cava and tapas, I became convinced that I would become a regular. In my numerous visits since, I have never been disappointed. If I were to gripe at anything, the proprietors could recognize (even reward) loyal customers such as ourselves for our lucrative and entertaining patronage. In any case, it's worth visiting Raval if only to appreciate the modernist carved wood interior."}
{"text":"Far away from the conception of Spain like an standardized homogeneous country mother of the Spanish tongue, you should know that it is composed by 17 Autonomous Communities; each one with different tongues, climates, ethnicities, gastronomy and traditions. Spanish is just the official language and what gives some identity abroad.  Bar Raval really makes you feel that you are hanging out in some bar of Spain. Lots of wood and charcuterie. I liked the chic casual vibe and decoration of the place.   They don't take reservations, and they are open from breakfast until dinner.  When we asked for a table, the hostess asked us if we would mind to be standing up around a barrel/table on the terrace: we didn't care, so we started our Toronto's tapas experience perfectly: with a glass of chilled Terras Gaudas, one of the most popular Alvarinhos (a must try if you are into wines).  The service was fast, friendly, and different people explained us the dishes. The menu had a lot of interesting items, and I liked the proposal. Something interesting is that they change the menu everyday!!!   We were told that the chef spends time in San Sebastian (Basques Country), so the menu has a lot of inspiration on their famous pintxos.  We ordered anchovies, pulpo a la gallega, croquetas, grilled calamari and scallops in pork fat.  The anchovies came in an order of 2 accompanied with 2 olives. They were meaty, rich in flavour, and a perfect match with the wine.  The \"pulpo a la gallega\" didn't look like it at all, and I'm sure a gallego would've had a hearth attack seen those tapas using that name (traditionally, it is served in a wooden plate, with potato in the middle, and the slices of octopus are dressed up just with sea salt, olive oil, and red pepper). However, the octopus was tasty and the bread was crunchy.  My husby loved the croquetas but I felted they were salty. The scallops came in a creamy tick sauce perfect for dipping.  The grilled calamari was winning the award for my favourite tapa, until my husby saw a guy sucking and enjoying some shrimps; he couldn't resist to ask about them and he was told they were prawns, and that they were a hit: they weren't exaggerating!!! They were so juicy, flavourful and tasty, that we even chew some of their legs...  This is not a place in where big eaters would end up satisfied. This a place to sample, drink, and share elaborated \"snacks\"."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was delicious. The decor is amazing and entirely made of wood. Just a heads up, it's standing room only, so don't expect to get too comfortable! Loved their selection of cocktails, too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, mediocre service.   Honestly, scrolling through the photos on yelp, the dishes didn't look like anything special. However I was very pleasantly surprised but everything we ordered. The scallops in Galician sauce was the highlight of my night - I usually prefer my scallops seated but this definitely changed my perspective of things. They came in a can, I wonder if they're available for take out...  We also ordered the kitchen bread, mushroom tower, croquetas, sobrassada and octopus (warm). I would highly recommend all the dishes except the octopus...it was good, but nothing special.   We waited 45 mins for a table on Friday night which wasn't as long as anticipated. It was standing room only which was something different but allowed the restaurant to be very efficient with their space. Service was slow ...we waited 30mins for our last 2 dishes despite ordering everything at once (I think they just forgot our last 2 orders) and no one stopped by to check on us for the entire duration of our meal."}
{"text":"Wednesday night was less busy but somehow the service was not on par.   We got seated on the patio and waited for a while before a server showed up. Unfortunately, we had to seek for their eye contact to get something going.   We asked for our bill with a glass of rosé cava, when it all arrived, the server was no where to be found for a while. After finishing our drinks and waiting a couple more minutes, I just walked inside to the bar and asked to pay.   Luckily, the bartender was really quick, didn't mind and was able to get someone else to handle the machine with me.   Just wishing the service was an off day this time."}
{"text":"Amazing bar ! The decor is made out of wooden shapes that remind you of Gaudi's architecture. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side but they're worth is. ALSO, their tomato bread is to die for. Will definelty come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up friends and have some tapas and drinks. Beef tenderloin was like meat candy. Nice cheeses, olives, bread and things to boot."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful architecture, chill and attentive staff.   The patatas bravas with chorizo, red pepper and egg were the best I've ever sampled and the cheesecake was unbelievable (luckily gluten-free for me)."}
{"text":"I went to this place while I was in town attending a tradeshow. I arrived at 8:30 pm on a Thursday night and the place was packed. They only had seats open along the walls which is almost like bar seating but most people stand because it's just that type of place if you are eating inside. The decor and vibe were amazing with lots of people coming and going trough the evening. I was there with 2 of my friends and we ordered pretty much one of everything on the menu. One of my favorite plates was the octopus. The drinks were very well made and I also enjoyed this passion fruit beer that was brewed locally in Toronto. I would rate this place 5 stars if you could reserve a table. The only thing I would complain about was the fact that even after I was already inside the restaurant consuming food and drinks I was not able to be put on a waiting list for a table. The staff pretty much told me that it is first come first serve. So as soon as I saw a table that opened up I immediately ran to it and established myself before anyone else tried to grab it. The staff did help me and my friends move all of our food and drinks over from the wall/bar area to our table. Overall the food was great and the drinks amazing. The service was also exceptional. I really recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a fun time with amazing decor, food and drinks."}
{"text":"I first heard of Bar Raval from a friend when I asked about a place in Toronto for Spanish tapas. A friend and I came here on a Thursday evening around 6pm, which I think is the perfect time to go. We got a patio table within 5 minutes of waiting (the weather was too nice to be inside). The server came to take our drinks and food order (we did have to wait about 20 minutes before she came but that wasn't a problem for us).  We ordered the octopus a la panxa, the steak and onion, the jamon croquetas and the morcilla and peas. The octopus was delicious! It was marinated in this spiced oil that complimented the octopus and potatoes perfectly, making it a very light but filling dish! The steak and onion was a little bit of a disappointment because we were expecting it to look like the photos on social media, however, the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare! The Jamon croquetas is a classic snack that is a breadcrumbed fried roll filled with this creamy cheesing filling. The last dish was recommended to us by the waitress and it is also known as a blood sausage and I have to recommend it as well! It paired really well with the peas!  Expect the tapas to be small (they are tapas) but great to share with another person! I would definitely come back here to check out their other classics."}
{"text":"Bar Raval is the \"thinks-he-is\" spot that doesn't need another five star review, but here I go writing one. I'd love to take them down a notch, but the thing is, they get the food so so right.   Tapas here are not so expensive. My faves are the shoshito peppers, a little plate of manchego, and the tomato bread. The lasts is their \"pan amb tomaquet\", and uses bread grilled to perfection.   The bartenders are straight out of crouching tiger, hidden dragon. I recommend sitting at the bar and trying not to let your jaw drop. Order a boulevardier, for instance. Watch for the pro twist of grapefruit.   One institutional aspect of Bar Raval is that they are open seven days a week for breakfast lunch and dinner. I love that. They will even sell you fresh bread. My only request is that they choose better daytime music: right now it's club music at 8am, when some mellow jazz would be welcome.   Evenings, it's a tough place to get in, with hour-long wait lists on a Friday night. They are somewhat a victim of their own success, attracting a snobby crowd that comes because it's the place to be seen right now. But don't worry : they'll move on when Chef Grant opens his next TWO places already in the works!"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's just one $. Every Time I'm there I spend at least $80. I'm not complaining though. The food here is delicious. If you are adventurous, order the barnacles. It's seasonal and you won't be disappointed. The seafood platter is worth every dime. I also love their chicken gizzard."}
{"text":"I can go there everyday every night!This is by far my most fav tapas place in Toronto. The amazing high ratings do live up to its ambiance/food and service.  The bonus to this place is it opens up as early as 8 in the morning which is rare to find for a place this kind.  Ambiance: So this place is divided in two sections one is the outdoor patio which is amazingly beautiful to sit at during the summer/spring time and then the historic indoor space which isn't too big but is just beautifully made with lots of great wood work and wonderful lighting.They are no tables instead there's a bar too that wraps around the space and a few high top tables with stools, just perfect.  Food: Oh my goodness I can actually eat here everyday and die a happy women.So this place carries tapas which means tiny plates.I have tried most of their menu items and they all are to die for.I highly recommend the hot octopus which is chunks of hot octopus with herb infused oil and potatoes with a hint of paprika.Its a gorgeous plate.I love their canned selection of which my fav is the mackerel, there are chunks of thick mackerel with oil and lotsa bread.Salmon croissants  is amongst my favorites too. And when here do not miss on their fabulous desserts they do not have a huge variety but their donuts and cake slices or to die for. The last time I was here I tried their hazelnut old-fashioned doughnut, I highly recommend that.  Service/Pricing/Parking: Every time I've been there the service has been top notch the manager and the crew are extremely helpful and the food comes out in a decent time.The bartenders are friendly and give good suggestions on drinks. As far as the pricing goes the tapas are fairly priced and so are the coffees.I feel their drinks are little pricey but are absolutely worth it. There is lots of paid parking outside the restaurant.  I absolutely love and adore this place and don't mind coming here over and over again. This by far is one of my most favorite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night around 10:30pm. It was packed, so we put our name down and went to another bar down the street. After an hour, we finally got a text that our spot is ready.   The service was great, given how busy they were. We were immediately asked if we wanted to have our jackets checked. The staff was very personal and helpful in providing recommendations.   We ordered the pigs head, tomato bread, and hot octopus. The pigs head was my favourite, thinly sliced pieces of melt in your mouth fatty cured meat, seasoned to perfection. The octopus was tasty, but I was a bit disappointed that a good portion of the dish consisted of potatoes.  I enjoyed the warm tomato bread on a cold day. We ended our visit with hot chocolate, which was too watered down for my liking.   Overall verdict: Gaudi inspired ambiance and service is fantastic. Cozy bar with delicately prepared food. Worth the wait and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"A very average bar - bad service, bad drinks, bad music, etc. The decor is nice tho."}
{"text":"Trendy. Packed. Delicious. Beautiful. The hype is true, we attempted this on a Thursday night hoping that the crowds would not be as mad as the weekend. Walking in around 6:30 we were able to find a place standing at the bar without a problem for 4 people. However we did not realize that it was a no wait list policy for tables. Meaning - no matter when you get there, if you want a table you need to be the first one hovering over it to jump in and get a spot.   We decided to stick to drinks and a few appetizers and head to another restaurant for an actual sit down meal.  The cocktails were amazing. Every single one... And appetizers - we had the octopus and the croquettes both incredible. Little touches go a long way - the croquettes generally served as three I think, they asked if we would like to have four. Amazing! More places should consider this.   We'll definitely come back to try the larger menu but perhaps coming earlier or much later and being prepared ahead not to sit."}
{"text":"A few of my ex-coworkers from York who live in North York and Markham were talking about having a fun night in town :) So I looked up a nice new place for them to check out with some great bars near by.  I arrived early and watched as Raval filled up, the patio space, indoor standing and seated spots. When my dining companions finally arrived the server who was so friendly this whole time while I was waiting managed to squeeze us in the nook in the corner. Perfect!  I could tell my friends were really enjoying the vibe of the establishment and were excited for the new experience of standing and drinking with out it being awkward :)  We started with a few drinks and I always appreciate when a server responds well to a request to choose a drink for a patron ;) My friend who is bad at making decisions made a request and our amazing server came back with something delicious and just for her.  We definitely over ordered off the menu since everything looked delicious!  Most notable:  Mushroom Tower Lomo abodabo Jamón & Manchego Kitchen Bread Octopus in Raval Sauce Chorizo Straciatella Boquerones (GET THIS)!  I need to go back now... LOL  The food was delicious, different and every bit as awesome as the environment you're enjoying it in. My friends left food on the table (I finished of course) and never thought they could be full off tapas :)  I'd say job well done!"}
{"text":"Back in the day before they were kind of a big deal, I stumbled in here after an unnamed taco place next door didn't have space to accommodate us.  I had just come back from Barcelona and was trying to show off my newfound tourist knowledge about this dude named Gaudi, when I looked at the bar and thought... Damn, that looks kind of Gaudi.  And lo and behold, for the first time in my life, my art reference was kind of on point.  And the food was incredible.  And the pinxos were so tasty.  And the drinks were strong and awesome.  And the crowd was fun.  And the music, and the waitstaff, and the crowded but intimate and warm atmosphere was perfect.  I went back here recently and noticed that they've expanded a bit with outdoor seating...  It took away from what I remembered of it when they had just opened (I think?) and there wasn't all that expansion.  Either way, this is one of my favorite bars ever (i.e. Ever, anywhere) and even though it's less of a place to fall into when a taco restaurant can't accommodate you anymore, it has major charm as a before, during, or after dinner venue.  Love Bar Raval.  And seriously, check out the wood on the bar."}
{"text":"Loved Bar Raval on so many levels! Think vibrant Spanish bar with rich distinctive features and the best tapas in the city!  We were surprised by how lively the place was on a Wednesday night but apparently that's the norm here. The space around the bar is small with several standing tables and high chairs so be prepared to stand and keep a lookout tables if you want to be seated as everything is on a first come first serve basis.  Came for drinks but actually ended up devouring half the menu. We could not stop eating the tapas here. *Tip: go with the servers recommendations! They are so helpful and knowledgeable about the whole menu. We loved everything that they suggested including:  - Stracciatella & boquerones: cheese and Spanish anchovies pintos - sounds simple but SOO delicious. Light and fluffy cheese with just the right amount of saltiness and fish oils from the anchovies on top of perfectly crispy crostini.   - Hot octopus: must try recommendation! Sizzling hot, the octopus was so tender and flavourful with potatoes that were equally as amazing.  - Skate wing and mushrooms:  seared flakey white skate meat with buttery corn and mushrooms, I'm usually not a fan of skate but this one was kind of irresistible.  Their drink list was extensive with a really great cocktail selection. My biggest regret was coming with a semi-full stomach and wasn't able gorge on more items on the menu. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast (brunch?) on multiple occasions (admittedly, usually hungover) and am consistently happy with the experience. The location has limited seating and they don't take reservations so I always show up for around 9am and have never had to wait for a seat. The décor is very interesting, with curved lines and beautiful carved wood. There's a small patio.     I always start with an espresso for that much-needed kick start in the morning. It's delicious!    There are usually special sandwiches and pastries at the bar so I always peruse those and pick out a couple to try. For the menu, my go-to items are the octopus, cojunado (quail egg, cured meat on a small piece of toast), and steak with grilled peppers (I have no idea what this is called). I also like to try a couple new things on the menu as well. The last item that stood out to me was the smoked mackerel. The smokiness wasn't overpowering and complimented the fishiness of the mackerel perfectly.   Despite never having been on a date here, I think it would make a great date spot. The ambiance can be very intimate and romantic, and since the dishes are tapas style, two people can get even closer by sharing!  Service is always very nice, especially when I always have a million questions about things on the menu or what's on special for the day.   Parking is easily found on the streets, especially early in the morning."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Definitely pricy. Almost all standing room only. Very crowded so slow service. Good place to go to socialize but not if you're hungry. Liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little tapas and cocktail lounge! Beautiful woodwork sets this bar apart. Went on a rainy afternoon for cocktails and dessert. Highly recommend the LZA and the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I went on Monday around 6:30pm and it was bumping. No line, just stood at the bar and had some cocktails and pintxos. They were all really good, the jamon&manchego, cojunado, egglant pintxo, all very lovely. It's slightly hard to eat if you have full set of lips on. The drinks were really good and strong with flavourful aromas.  On the other hand.. the venue is tiny. They have flies flying around the bar (at least 5 of them) with a hole in the ceiling and spiderwebs around corners of the liquor cabinets. It just made me lose my appetite.. The interior is lovely but I just can't believe what I saw."}
{"text":"Better than Isabel! Everything was delicious. Especially liked the smoked mackerel in a can, squid in pork fat, shrimp cream toast, some mackerel (?) on toast, and the pork cheek. Drinks were exceptional as well. Pretty small and not much seating, but we were lucky enough to get one of the 4 stools. Great place to stop by for a little pintxos before heading out. Easily one of the best restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"my friend karen suggested we go here for a quick bite.  i had forgotten that the restaurant was meant to be \"barcelona\" style - and we were meant to stand up.  fortunately a couple of stools freed up inside just after we ordered so we were able to move into the dimly lit restaurant. felt nice after being in the hot sun on the patio.  i know, but i'm getting old and i like to be comfortable.  karen had been before so i suggested she order. she did an amazing job. i can't remember everything we had. sardines on toast and a few other things. beef and peppers. green beans with tomato and olive sauce i believe. we had what i would call a \"breakfast sandwich\" which was the only thing i wouldn't order again. not that it wasn't really good, but the other dishes, were standouts.  definitely would go back here again. the staff was really nice and the wait staff would stop to explain dishes that they were carrying when they noticed us drooling.  seriously - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had to try this after going to Bar Isabel. It did not disappoint. It's definitely more tapas, the selection are more snacks than plates.  They octopus is cut up pieces in some very tasty olive oil. Don't waste the Olive oil either, ask for some extra bread, it's still worth it!  The canned foods including the mackerel and razor clams are delish. Make sure to put some bar raval secret sauce into it!  The staff are so very kind and attentive. During the day they open with a selection of treats on the bar with coffee including tiny donuts and Spanish tortilla.  Cheers to the bartender for Dope 2.0! Let me know when 3.0 comes out!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little spot. It was a foodies dream. There isn't a wrong decision on the menu!"}
{"text":"Not enough stars. Staff is friendly and well informed about the menu/cocktails. Chicken liver mousse with rhubarb is my favorite. Followed by the simple, but amazing tomato bread. Food comes out fast and drinks even faster. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Overall this is a great bar to try - I know a lot of people say it's their favourite.  I wouldn't personally go that far - I think it's a little over hyped as other reviewers have said, but a great bar nonetheless  The décor is quite interesting and unlike what you have seen before - I won't try to even describe it - either look at the pictures or surprise yourself when you get there.  This is a fairly tiny bar that gets absolutely rammed all day.  There is a \"waiting\" area where you can get drinks while a seat opens up inside the actual bar - it's mainly stand up seating (only a few chairs) so if you have issues standing up for long periods of time then this bar is not for you.   We ordered a variety of things:  - beet/clementine salad  - octopus  - lamb cheeks with grilled radicchio   Everything was really good - the octopus just melted in your mouth delicious and the lamb cheeks were really tender.  The beet/clementine salad was a nice refreshing touch to the heavier meats, but when I showed my Spanish friend the picture of it, she indicated it is not a Spanish dish (just fyi).  The drinks were good but the service a little slow, but considering they were extremely busy it doesn't surprise me.  I'd come here for drinks and a few apps, but if you are really hungry move on to another place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Tried about half the menu and each piece was better than the last!  The waiters are very knowledgable, they gave great descriptions about every single item on the menu"}
{"text":"I came here one evening with a girlfriend.  It's a really nice place, and they keep the numbers comfortable so it's never super duper crowded.  There is a small patio, and a separate room, that looks like an enclosed outdoor patio (I can't be sure of this, it was raining and dark when I went).  It's lovely here, and they have good tapas and drinks.  I would totally come back here!"}
{"text":"I like Bar Raval, the food is good. I love tapas and this is one of my favorite spots to grab tapas. There's a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Plus the restaurant is very casual, it's a nice spot to grab snacks in between meals as well. One thing that makes me not want to come is that it's a very small restaurant with limited seats. Because it's such a popular restaurant and they don't take reservations, you might have to wait a while to get a table. Overall, I do recommend visiting Bar Raval but try to come early or else you will have to wait a while for a seat."}
{"text":"If you ever need to unravel, I highly recommend Bar Ravel!  (Puns end here)...   Of all the places we visited while on a recent trip to Toronto, Bar Raval was by far the most enjoyable.  If the many reasons, the Staff ranked #1.  We came here twice... once in Saturday afternoon for a cocktail and on Sunday for a light snack.  Each experience was unique and on each occasion, my fiancé and I were treated special and made to feel immediately welcome.   First, the cocktails... made by a master craftsman named Brett who can literally turn everyday spirits and mixers into masterpieces.  A spicy tequila drink served in a tall glass with a lime was thirst quenching and not overly strong. The spice was perfect.  I honestly can't remember the other drink we had, but it was bourbon and it was special.  Watching Brett make these libations was a treat too... he is absolutely a master - from form to finish.  Plus, he's nice and likes to tell you about his drinks too.  Service in Sunday was so good.  Mostly because of the friendly staff - two young ladies with flair and professional loveliness...   Now, the food:  on Sunday at least, expect to find handmade tapas style sandwiches and specialties like I've seen nowhere.  Chirozo and sautéed pepper sandwiches, manchego, little tastes of marinated octopus done almost as a ceviche, pastries, breads, all of these at reasonable prices and done up so special... nothing here is prepackaged.  You can watch the kitchen staff hand preparing every little thing.    Hanging in the kitchen are various charcuterie and I wanted to try them all.  Do yourself a favor and come into this special place sometime.  Look at the wood crafted walls and then feast on the ambiance, food and drink selections... you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Reminded me of Europe, such a cool spot couple of my friends & I stumbled by while bar hopping along little Italy area. I'd give this place 5 stars if the drinks were less costly. I would recommend checking out this place if you have a bit of extra money to spend. The atmosphere and wine selection is bomb. If you like wine, you'll love this place! I'd go back to have more wine and try out the tapas."}
{"text":"If we had a 5+ selection, I'd select that for this place. We came here based on a review and personal recommendations. You must sit at the bar so you can watch Lew who is a Hospitality Professional (that's how passionate he is about his job!). He is quite amazing to watch Mia your cocktails! Trust me, sit at the bar.   We started with a couple cocktails. They seem bit pricey but if u factor in the overall experience then you will not think that!  We then started with a selection of meat and cheese. We had the pigs head (I'm squeamish and didn't want to try this but I'm glad we did cuz it was so tasty), the Serrance (also recommend), and the Iberico Bellota (worth the price although very salty which is OK by me). For the cheese we had Idiazabal and it was a great pairing to the meats.   Our second dish was Smoked Mackerel and it was so amazing!! You must try it!!   We ended with the Cheese Cake and some sherry. What an amazing nite!!! The cocktails, the entertainment, the food!  This place elevated the dining experience for and we will NOT forget this place. Remember to sit at the bar, that's where the experience is waiting for u to discover!! And Lew was that ingredient that elevated this experience for us! We have a new drink he made for us and we will forever call this drink the Lew!!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval is a hidden gem!  The decor inside looks Gaudi-inspired - Barcelona style. Love the curved wooden architecture - we couldn't get a seat since seats were limited but had a wonderful time here despite standing the whole time. Service was excellent.  COCKTAILS - CUBAN HOT CAKE 5/5 The waitress recommended this cocktail to me when I asked for something on the sweeter end. So good! Can't taste the alcohol (which I prefer).  JAMONES DE JUVILES - TREVELEZ 5/5 Loved the jamon...!! So fresh and not too salty - we preferred eating this jamon alone to taste the original flavour because the bread that came with it took away its taste. SO GOOD :)   CANNED - SPAIN - BERBERECHOS 5/5 Worthy of the $$$$! There's not that many clams in total but the taste is so unique, its worth a try. This is one of our top 5 choices of tapas.  TUNA PICKLE GILDA 4/5 The tuna was a great combo for texture - pickles were crunchy and tuna was soft and chewy. Yum!  MORCILLA & EGG 4/5 Second time trying blood sausage but still a little iffy about it - it's probably because of my first experience though.. It was rather gross, in Iceland (probably because fermented sharks was part of its combo) LOL  TAPAS - ESQUEIXADA 4/5 Fresh fish marinated deliciously, also came with tomatoes, onions and olives. It was so hard to eat with the toothpicks that they provided haha - one of the top 5 tapas  TAPAS - PIG CHEEKS IN CIDER 4/5  The pig cheeks were soft and tender - I think they cooked this with honey so this tapas was pretty sweet. The also added chorizos with it and they tasted SO GOOD :D   A LA PLANXA - SCALLOPS IN UNI SAUCE 5/5 So yummy!! The uni sauce was delicious! If only they added more sauce to it haha. It comes with bread so you can use it for dipping. Scallops were fresh and cooked to perfection :) Loved it!"}
{"text":"There is very little I could add to what you've already read. So I'll try to add a little twist to this perspective.  Having lived in Spain, I will say, I tend to stay away from Spanish themed restaurants because of the built in bias I have. What I can talk about it - the quality of the food and ingredients. Which in this case as you have already read in a multitude of reviews is outstanding. Fresh, flavourful and well seasoned ingredients pack every dish -just tasty food.  So whether you know anything about the country or not - it's just good here.  I ordered an americano and a cafe con leche. Both quite different than what I was familiar with but - again - very good.  Phil & Sebastian Ethiopian Blend for their espresso based drinks was outstanding. One of the best I have had in the city. Wonderful notes to the coffee. I would have ordered another if my stomach could handle it.  Now, not the coffee I had in Spain but very good. I enjoyed it.  One of my favourite things to have during siesta was the hot chocolate. It is widely different in North America but the second time round the woman in charge of their coffee program sent over a different version which was so much better.    It's difficult to re-create even the simplest things. Over the years, I have learnt that the base ingredients available in Spain are vastly different and influence the flavour of the food. So milk, butter, tomatoes, olive oil always impart a different natural flavour then even the best versions grown in North America.  So what I have learnt is I need to re-visit Spain and enjoy the best I can get in Canada or the USA. This little place definitely is a lovely experience.  I can't leave a review here without mentioning the architecture. The influence of Gaudi is undeniable when seeing the undulating wood interior. One of my favourite parts of the whole design is the incorporation of that whimsy into the bar. Specifically, the chopping board with an opening echoing the signature Gaudi shape. It was a very thoughtful inclusion.   The bathrooms. A stark contrast to what you see when you first walk in but overall not my favourite part. I was looking for more Gaudi Park meets Toronto's infamous underground bathrooms.  It's still a nice space but definitely does not echo the jaw dropping design you are initially drawn to.  Overall, awesome."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile!   When you first walk in, you are in the patio area. If you would like to go to the bar area, you will have to put your name on the waiting list. The only difference between the bar and patio area is that the bar area has some seats, music, coat check, and there's more to look at in terms of decor.   Both areas serve the same drinks and food.   We moved to the inside bar cause we wanted to get the full experience! The inside bar is super cute and nicely decorated. Be prepared to stand as \"bar\" raval is a standing type tapas place.   The drinks are pretty hard handed, rightfully so given the price.  Nothing too special in my opinion.   The tapas are delicious.  We had:  Lamb belly - very flavourful and tender: A+  Stracciatella & Boquerones: A recommendation by the waitress. Very good! The mozzarella cheese melted in my mouth! A+   Hot octopus: delicious! Very chewy and flavourful. Get some bread and dip it into the oil. Taste delicious. A+  Razor clams: came in a can. It wasn't too salty. I liked it. Just not sure if it was worth $26. Perhaps, their cooked food was more bang for the buck. Regardless, an B+  The atmosphere was awesome. Just loved the vibe. The decor was so detailed and pretty.   A great place for pre-drinks and/or snacks. We weren't full and had to get pizza after.   Place is pretty pricey as expected from yelpers. For 4 cocktails and 4 dishes, the bill came up to $160 (before tax and tip)"}
{"text":"Ever been to a place that's over-hyped and then you finally get in after being put on a waiting list for an hour and forty-five minutes only to be treated like garbage and not even get to sit at table to eat your overpriced food that doesn't really impress you in taste or presentation? In fact, the boiled flavourless mushrooms and 2 shrimps on a toothpick for $9.50  looked like it was prepared by a 5 year old. Well I have."}
{"text":"It's like being transported to San Sebastian.   Even on a Monday night at 9pm there's a wait. The wait is worth it.   It's a pintxo place so it's all about the small dishes. We ordered about five dishes which was enough for two of us. We loved almost everything we had. The chorizo was awesome, as was the tower of mushrooms. The kitchen bread (sourdough bread topped with something creamy, roasted red peppers and anchovies) was not our thing but if you're into all of those things you'll probably like it. The steak was cooked to perfection and the shishito peppers were so good. The real winner of the night was the Basque cheesecake. Not too sweet, just fluffy and amazing.   The staff and sommelier were super knowledgeable, helpful and welcoming. As was the doorman. I mean if someones gotta tell you you have to wait to get it on a Monday night it might it might as well be that guy.   Any downside to the place was not the restaurant's fault. There was the obligatory dude who thought he was special and jumped the line causing everyone else to have to wait just a little bit longer. Ugh.. there's no place like home, right?"}
{"text":"Went for early lunch during the week. Restaurant interior was as lovely during the day as during the nights I had previously visited.  Cocktails were good as always, the food we ordered this time was tasty but not mind-blowing (tomato bread, hot octopus, jamon & manchego, morcilla & egg, cojunado, pigs head)  The big let down was the service, which was inattentive and slow compared to previous visits. For example, we asked for the drink menu, which was brought to us, but then the server didn't return for nearly 15 minutes to take our drink order and didn't seem to even be around to flag down. It wasn't particularly busy either.  Would likely return if I was in the neighbourhood, but this last visit has put me off specifically planning a trip there."}
{"text":"Bar Raval made me feel nostalgia for my days in Barcelona with a glass of wine and a couple plates of tapas. :)  At first sight, Bar Raval has really cute wooden decor that's shaped in Gaudi's signature curves. The space is a bit small, and mostly standing room with the exception of several bar stools. The tables are barrels which are quite interesting. This is similar to Spanish Pintxo bar settings.  The food was really delicious! We had several small dishes from the selection and the price was quite moderate.  Our favorite was the squid with black rice! And surprisingly the rice was the best part. The tiger shrimp and romesco sauce was also excellent.  I would recommend coming to this place early, or come in between the happy hour and night drinking hour to get a spot as it can get quite crowded. It's mostly standing room, so comfortable shoes might be appropriate."}
{"text":"Bar Raval is so much like that tapas place you remember from Spain, only 5 times more expensive.  I am a fan, though the intricately-designed standing-only space inside (where you will be bumped, jostled, and where they hope you will run up a tab more quickly and leave) can get tiresome. Fortunately, they have seating out on their patio, which is great on a nice day.  The food here is classic Spanish-style tapas. The ham, peppers, mackerel, and octopus creations (whether served in a Can, smoked, or in a more developed dish are excellent. Recently I enjoyed the hamburguesa, tuna and melon, mackerel, and tomato bread. Everything was at least very good. The hamburguesa was somewhat dull, yet good. The tuna and melon was the standout. (They make their bread in a space above their sister restaurant, Bar Isabel.)  Like Bar Isabel, they have an excellent bar program that commands about 2$ more per drink than your average not-cheap Toronto watering hole for cocktails. The selection of wine and beer is very good as well, though not sure that they have Estrella Damm on draught, which should be a requirement.  Show up in mid-afternoon or before 6 pm for your best shot at a spot and opportunity to hear conversation more easily."}
{"text":"We approached what we thought was the location of this bar, there is no sign.  The door man asked, \"Are you looking for Bar Raval?\" and we were escorted in.  There are very few seats, standing tables and a standing bar across one wall.  Motif reminds me of a 1920s Art Deco Spanish painting.  We were served promptly, and this place was pretty busy already at 6 pm when we arrived.  The drinks were very good, expensive though, $14 and up.  Food was declicious as well, but also pricey.  I felt very hip standing in amongst trendy people sipping a trendy cocktail.  As the night went on, the place filled up fast, and late comers were relegated to an enclosed, heated patio.  Would I go back?  Maybe?  I would probably pay the prices if I could be at the bar, or be on the patio on a beautiful summer night.  Otherwise, no."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday a few weeks back and she wanted to grab lunch at Bar Raval, so off we went around 12:30 on a weekday.  We walked in and the place was surprisingly crowded. So crowded, in fact, that we were forced to stand by the window. The absence of a chair or stool was initially quite the turn-off, but I will admit that it was something I quickly got used to. (The delicious beer probably helped.)  We took a quick look at some of the pre-prepared items on offer and it was certainly difficult to resist any of the delicious-looking options. I can't remember everything we ordered, but one of the more impressive items was the Pig Head & Romesco, which was served on a crusty piece of bread. This was actually amazingly tasty, which was a surprise, certainly, given its name.  Another highlight was the Morcilla (blood sausage) & Egg, also served on bread. The oozing yolk covered the open-faced sandwich and the blood sausage had a rich taste that was impossible to resist.  The only somewhat disappointing item was the B.C. Side Strip Shrimp, which came unpeeled and adorned with eggs (they looked like eggs, anyway). They admittedly tasted quite good once they were peeled, but it was too much effort for too small a portion.  We finished off with an item that wasn't on the menu, a Basque cheesecake. This was unlike any cheesecake I've ever tried. The texture was super creamy, but the taste was hardly sweet at all. But the flavors more than made up for it. A big winner, to be sure.  The less-than-conventional seating could be problematic for certain patrons, but if you can get past that, you'll be treated to a seriously unique and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant--inside and outside. The wooden interiors felt so welcoming. Now let's talk about the food because it is absolutely incredible. Although my friends and I tried around eight dishes in total, I highly recommend the Ffied Eggplant with Honey, Galician Octopus, and the Smoked Mackerel. Definitely on the pricier side but honestly worth your time and money. Most importantly the customer service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Very nice cozy space though no obvious sign with the name. Exciting unique spanish menu focused on Tapas. Very expensive though. A few shavings of chorizo and 5 cubes of cheese 5 olives and 5 brined chilies. ..and that's considered the large portion sells for $22. The beer size is outrageous as well, 5 Oz or 20 Oz. ..where is the 10 folks? 5 Oz beer is a sample size never seen it this way and it's for $5.  Lunch for my wife and I with one miniature size beer costs $99+ 10% tip  (5 tapas) ...outrageous. ..shame on Canadian business and food industry.   The smoked Mackarell served in the can it came from, they just opened it and removed the lid, buttery and had a good flavor though. $14.50.  In Barcelona I paid e10 for 5 or 6 much larger Tapas....Shame on Canada"}
{"text":"Bar Raval came highly recommended to me from a foodie friend and so I came here with high expectations. So that might have affected my star rating of it. But having said that, I like this place! I definitely have to return and try more stuff here. I ordered a bunch if things today, and if have to say everything was good but only a few things really stuff out. Tomato bread with an order of the anchovies was really good. I swear the tomatoes had some spicy kick to them or something. The mushroom tower was delicious, the mushrooms were tender and sweet. The chicken gizzards were awesome great as well. It wasn't until I got home that I read other people's reviews and that made me want to come back to try some more dishes. That's always a good sign to me... And I suspect I'll raise my rating of this place after I visit it a few more times.  I can see other reviewer's points that the meals here can be a little pricy. At the same time, we left there very full. And whereas a few other reviewers felt negatively about the service, I had a very positive experience. Madison was great and gave us awesome recommendations of things to try. I'd come back again just because of her service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I lived in Barcelona for 4 years and it was a similar vibe and experience"}
{"text":"Wow this restaurant was soooo amazing! The service was superb, the food was excellent (it really exceeded my expectations) and the location was neat. It really felt as if I was back in Barcelona enjoying some Delish Tapas! Other than this place not taking reservations and being extremely expensive, I highly recommend it. Go in and try some different types of tapas and share with your friends! The fried eggplant and the mackerel made my year!!"}
{"text":"Although beautifully designed, Bar Raval was the most over-hyped, overrated and overpriced restaurant I've ever been to.   We started out with cocktails, which were delicious. We then moved on to a selection of a few meats and cheeses. The cheeses were brought out on white side plates and cut into cubes. Seemed like they were from the local grocery store...Also, no cheese board, no honey, no nuts, no figs. Nothing that you would expect when ordering meat and cheese. The meats were also on the same saucer plates. Kind of strange when ordering cheeses and meats that are 8 dollars each and supposedly imported from Spain. We asked for bread. The server took maybe 20 minutes to accomplish this. We asked twice. We assumed it was taking so long because they were making the bread in house. When we finally got the bread, it was cold and I'm almost positive it was from the Ace bakery. We're not sure why it took so long to cut up some ace baguette but it did.   Next we got the octopus in Raval sauce. We had eaten the octopus at Isabelle before and loved it. This tasted like octopus covered in canned tomato sauce. After the server dropped off the octopus she then brought us some chips to go with it. THE CHIPS WERE MISS VICKY'S!! She brought them in a fake wood plastic bowl. After we tried the chips and realized they were Miss Vicky's, we asked her if this was true. She got very awkward and said she had no idea where the chips were from. At least lie and say they're house made or imported from Spain! Crazy.   We then got the roasted baguette with bacon, pepper and quail egg. Looked amazing but upon biting into it I realized it was simply plain toasted white baguette with Canadian maple leaf bacon and roasted red pepper with a quail egg on top. I could have made it. Not one thing stood out about it. They at least could have put a Spanish style pancetta on it...Next we had the squid cooked in pork fat. My friend took one bite and was gagging. I ended up eating the whole dish and agreed it wasn't good. Way too salty and the squid was very, very rubbery. Didn't really taste like anything except salty sea water. We had a few other small dishes which were good, but again, nothing special.   Overall, if you're dying to try Bar Raval save your money and go to Isabelle instead. It's 100 times better. Clearly, the majority of the money behind this restaurant went into its design, leaving no money left to invest in their most important asset: the food."}
{"text":"I never made it inside so my review is simply of my outdoor patio/wait-list experience! I arrived just past midnight on a Saturady and was ushered into the outdoor heated patio area and given an estimate of 45 minutes to get into the bar. The outdoor patio had great service. This place takes care of its patrons. However, at -20 degrees it was still way too cold even with their heaters. My feet froze and we all ended up giving in before the 45 minute timeline. Luckily the streetcar stops right in front and there are zillions of taxis on College Street to take you away.   I will definitely be back, but on a warmer night or an earlier time where I'm not potentially getting frostbite on their patio."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Bar Raval. Came here on a Saturday night and it was quite busy. We ended in the main restaurant area which actually was a standing table. The restaurant is Gaudi inspired and having been to Barcelona it was really cool to see. The vibe of the restaurant was great with a hip crowd. Service at first was a bit confusing and slow because we weren't a dedicated seats (ie. kind of just standing at a bar). We got two cocktails which I didn't find too special, especially because they were very pricey. The food for me was definitely the highlight. I actually found all the tapas we got really good. My favourite was the octopus and the peppers which I highly recommend getting if you're here. We also got the scallops which very fresh. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The tapas are awesome- had the tuna salad, the tuna skewer things, the raw scallop, and croquettes. Unfortunately, the price per item is actually per item as in 1 croquette = $8 and that's absurd. I respect food, but it seems that these things are overpriced just because people are willing to pay for them and not because the quality is any better.  The drinks we had were good, my favorite was the tequila based one at the bottom of the menu with ginger and jalapeño.  Glad I came to check out the hype, but I think the food was a one-time deal for me that I won't be doing again."}
{"text":"I personally thought that Bar Raval was way better than it's sister (and original) restaurant Bar Isabel. The atmosphere is really cool. The wood bar is OAK cool architectural feat that adds ambiance and makes you feel like you are in Spain.  The pintxos are good, my favourite is the one with the pickle and tuna."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews and was thoroughly impressed.   When we got here(around 9:20) there were only a few guests. By the time we left, the place was packed to the brim. They don't take reservations so I felt as though we got lucky.   We ordered the cold octopus, Jamon and manchego pintxo, croquettes, beef tenderloin, skate, and the cheese cake. The beef tenderloin was cooked to PERFECTION (it was tinkering on the border of being too salty AND I'm not a big fan of the shoshito peppers that accompanied it). The croquettes were so rich and succulent. The skate came with mushrooms, corn and a brown butter sauce and was heavenly. Everything was exceptional but the cold octopus definitely stole the show. I could have eaten 10 plates.   The food came out in a timely manner. The staff was so attentive but NOT to a point where it was annoying. They demonstrated their expert knowledge of the menu. Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I don't have a bad thing to say about Bar Raval. The food, the atmosphere, the drinks, the interior design, the service. All on point and the whole experience makes me think of late nights in Spain.   We had gone for a late dinner on a Saturday night. Left our number, grabbed a drink next door, and were seated within 45 mins. For a party for 4, we got cozy and shared one table in the patio. We had 7 tapa dishes. The few that really stood out were the cuttlefish fideo, the canned razor clams imported from Spain, and the Serrano jamon. I only wish we had the stomach to also try to squid in ink and the pig's head. The food were listed on the menu and served in the order from simpler to more complex so your taste buds won't be overwhelmed. Everything was delicious.   I think what topped off the night were the gaudi-inspired interior designer which completed the whole experience! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"When you want to go to a bar that changes the way you think about bars, go to Bar Raval. Why? You'll have the best time trying dishes you can't pronounce and cocktails like you've never tasted. As for the drink collection - 10 different vermouths, a dozen sherry choices, and a nice list of sparkling or red wines, everything from 2013 Hinterland Borealis Method Charmat from Prince Edward County to 2011 Posta Borhaz red from Hungary.    The menu is a series of Spanish pintxos (also known as pinchos, differentiated from tapas based on their origin in the Basque Country part of Spain), many of which you'll need a Spaniard to understand--but thankfully, the service is zooming around the small room ready to answer any questions you may have. It is roughly divided by cheeses, cured meats, canned specialties, tapas, pintxos, small sandwiches (bocadillos), and a few fried or grilled dishes.   For something filling, the lomo abodabo at $10 shows off slices of juicy pork loin nestled in between toasted buns and a pepper hanging off the top. Tapas are a great way to try a handful of vastly different dishes without breaking the bank: shishitos, peppers with a mild spice sprinkled with salt; salchichas fritas, slices of fried sausage, which you can order with one of their cheeses, like six-month sheep manchego."}
{"text":"Nice bar area with amazing tables ( smaller sized but always busy) A bit overpriced. Food is very simple, they have a selection of canned fish..The security guy is friendlies guy ever."}
{"text":"Great variety. Light, tasty, original tapas.  Dinner and drinks was a delight while breakfast was equally delicious.   Toast, with red pepper and anchovies is so different and light.  Cocktails are also very original."}
{"text":"The food and the drinks are very good. A little bit on the pricier side but I understand as it is one of the few places in the city that offers this type of tapas and pintos.  The canned razor clams were also very delicious.  I'm docking off a five star to a two because the service was horrendous!! The waitress actually yawned at us while we ordered, it took forever to flag her down to actually get our order and it took us forever to get the bill.  The restaurant manager just stared at us and did nothing the whole night.  He just kept avoiding eye contact!!  I love the food but the service has ruined it for me and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Basque Baby!  Great atmosphere with the large woodwork and standing tables.  It was a perfect destination to try some new things and some old favorites.  Everything was spot on with their elevated pintxos.   Nice cocktail selection too."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, so much yes!  I love mixology and experimenting with cocktails, so I was delighted when we wandered (we searched high and low) for a nice bar with a different vibe open late on CIvic Day (I'm not Canadian and still don't understand the holiday, oh well)    We had a couple of rounds, the drinks were strong, complex, but very tasty. We didn't order any food, but there is always next time!"}
{"text":"I usually write long-ass reviews because Yelp keeps prompting me, and like Homer Simpson, I'm the highly suggestible type. Not now, though. I'm gonna keep it brief and to the point. I love you Bar Raval.  If our new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would amend marriage laws to allow for a man-restaurant union, I'd pop the question.   If I could live there, I'd move my ass in today and claim squatter's rights.   You had me when I first laid eyes on the sinuous curves of your well-lit interior. My first taste of that shishito-filet combo and I knew I was a goner.   I am, your humble and obedient servant.  Besos!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely falls under my 2 star category... reason being is i would not re-visit.. places that I give 3 stars, I would re-visit only if someone wanted to go.. and 4 stars meaning I would recommend and go-back for more.  I would however give their sister restaurant Bar Isabel 4 stars..  We came here with a party for 4, bill was $200 plus tip for 5 tapas (Appetizer dishes) and 4 beers..  All of feel this place is over-rated and over-priced..  We tried to stay away from canned food.. but they actually charge $40 for a canned fish Appetizer..  The faux goies was only tasted good on the first bite.. the remaining bites were over-powered with too much sweetness..  The cured pork (the expensive one) was $40 for approximately 15 small pcs of prosciutto like deli..   Local craft craft beer was $10 a can...  The octopus and mussels were ok... but for the price they charged, I would much rather go to a Japanese restaurant eat Sashimi grade octopus..  I have other friends who have been here before and they all agree this is not a place any of us would ever re-visit if someone from our group wanted go..   Another thing is.. this place has 2 tables.. the rest of the population has to eat standing.."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool interior. It has wood accents and a nice ambience to it. The place is a bit small so when it fills up, it does get a bit cozy. I went for after work drinks and snacks though so it wasn't too packed yet. There's also a outdoor patio section. I got the pixie blood drink which was pretty good. I also tried the mushroom tower and the hot octopus tapas dish. They were both very flavourful. I would definitely order them again. The mushroom dish is very buttery as well. The service was also excellent. I would highly recommend this Spanish themed restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bar Isabel, so when I heard about Bar Raval, I had to try it out and it did not disappoint!  I went on a Thursday night and we had to wait about 30 minutes, which isn't too bad at all. The place has amazing woodwork that curves and its just great to look at. The vibe at the place is great.  The staff are very knowledge and they take the time to explain the items on the menu. As for the food, we ordered a number of things on the menu.  SQUID IN PORK FAT: The best of both worlds! The pork fat crisped the squid and I felt that I could eat this dish for days on end!  SCALLOPS IN UNI SAUCE: The uni sauce was delicious, I used up the bread to soak up all the sauce. The scallops were cooked nicely as well.  LEEKS AND ROMESCO: So darn good! I was a bit hesitate about ordering this, but I really enjoyed it.   BARNACLES: I never had them before. The server taught us how to eat them and they were great!  The other dishes that we ordered were delicious as well, the pig head and romesco and mushroom tower.  Plates that I thought were Mediocre: -Tomato Bread -Octopus in Raval Sauce  I loved the experience from beginning to finish and would be here again!"}
{"text":"Was here for a launch event of Whitley Neil Gin and I got to try a few tapas. There were a raw bar at the patio which feature oysters to tuna, and king crabs.  Great atmosphere and delicious food! Bar stools were first come first serve and there were various barrels around the restaurant that served as cocktail tables.   -Botifarra & Peppers: Slightly charred followed by a natural sweetness from the red bell peppers.  -Jamon Croquetas: had a crispy exterior, while the filling is smooth, creamy and super tasty.   -Stracciatella & Boquerones: The cheese was fluffy with just the right amount of saltiness from the anchovies, paired with a light zesty sauce on top of a perfectly crispy crostini  -Shishito Peppers: wasn't really spicy as I expected it to be! The heat is still manageable and the pepper had a grassy and slightly sweet flavor to it.  -dulce de leche and jamon: The donut was absolutely fluffy, light and delicious! Not too sweet with a nice savory touch from the candied jamon."}
{"text":"Damn right, lunch here is as good as it gets! This is a fantastic spot. The service was 100% on point, and not to mention (the most important thing), each dish was absolutely delicious. I let the Chef de Cuisine keep the plates coming, that is until gluttony kicked-in. Even if given the menu, I'd have a tough time choosing; they we're all incredibly savory. Siesta mode kicked-in afterwards, but this venue is definitely worth checking out, and YES overeating a bit too."}
{"text":"Went to Bar Raval on a Saturday night expecting a small line up, who knew the estimate wait time was an hour. They have a fully heated patio with the full menu so we decided to wait.   It seems like you don't have 1 particular server - everyone helps each other out. Throughout the night, I had/tried The Good Life, Young Leaves,  Absinthe Minded, and Scarlet Carson.  Scarlet Carson is a gin cocktail with a very distinct lemon taste. I really enjoyed this cocktail..well, I really enjoy anything with gin in it. Absinthe Minded was a vodka cocktail (I believe..), not so fruity like Scarlet Carson, with a bitter aftertaste.The Good Life was my YOLO approach. Had no idea what La Guita Manzanilla was, but still went with it. The drink was definitely the strongest, most bitter, and least sweet. It has a very confusing aftertaste which I thought I'd never like but I quite enjoyed it. Last but not least, tried a sip of the Young Leaves - cute, fruity drink for any cocktail starters or fruity cocktail lovers. The servers here were super attentive. You won't get bothered by them half way throughout your drink, but they will approach you the moment your glass is empty.  Atmosphere is romantic, slightly upscale, dim - a perfect place for a night out with a date or to chill with a friend or two. This is NOT where you would bring your girlfriends for a fun night, or a group of homies to hang out. Age range is about 25+."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated on the inside, the interior is very unique. The atmosphere is also very friendly, with plates you can just pick from the main bar table, that has small sandwhiches, and donuts.  For brunch, we ordered tapas to share. The mushroom tower was the best, with the well-infused garlic bread. The Octopus was alright however, wasn't cooked as well as it could've been but the potatoes that it was served with were great. Would come again."}
{"text":"Finally went here for dinner/snacks/drinks this past Friday and it was definitely as good as I thought it would be! The overall vibe of Bar Raval was great, from the moment we walked in to find a spot to the time we walked out, my lady and I were definitely impressed and enjoyed the whole experience. Initially we got only the standing bar area, which in itself was great since the lighting at night was nice inside the resto, but we eventually lucked out and got a couple of stools for the night.   Food was amazing, just like it's sister restaurant. No photos unfortunately since I was too busy enjoying them but the canned scallops were a total surprise for me! I honestly wondered why canned items were on the menu but they were delicious!   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Straciatella a la boquerones is a must! And the cheesecake is divine."}
{"text":"Amazing Tapas and amazing place to eat ! Great service and had such a great atmosphere  Coming back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unreal. I had missed Barcelona and Spanish tapas ever since I left there in 09. This place does it perfectly. The decor is perfectly fine - all the hand crafted wood reminds you of guadi. the dim lighting is great to set the relaxed tone and draw attention to the bar, which is staffed by cocktail artists who take their work seriously and it shows in the quality of everything they make. Came back for breakfast last week and was so pleasantly surprised and happy they're open all day. All around my favourite bar on College right now."}
{"text":"A little hyped in my opinion - but Grant van Gameren does make good restaurants.  It's a bit of a formula. You will find:  - excellent cocktails - good tapas - excellent food quality - ambivalent service - unique interior (art really) - expensive prices (with sprinkle's of surprisingly cheap)  Bar Raval's greatest contribution to T.O is in the idea that good food can be served late (and even early in BR's case). It's a little relaxed in that this isn't a sit down place - it's a bar first and foremost.   Food is good - i just often find myself disappointed with the octopus - which they're famous for. It's really hit or mis at Bar Raval and also at Isabel for that matter. It's just such a shame - you go in craving something they boast about - but they just can't seem to get it consistently right. Octopus roulette."}
{"text":"No doubt about it, Bar Raval is my FAVOURITE Spanish restaurant in all of Toronto! Cute little spot along College St. with a great selection of items. Everything is so delicious and so flavourful and the best part about this gem is that it's open 7 days a week!! Only downer is that they do not take reservations, and when they are busy, they are EXTREMELY busy. I had dinner here with my boyfriend on a very packed night and we had to share a little table with another couple.. it was a bit awkward because we could hear eachother's conversations but nonetheless I would go back here every single time!"}
{"text":"I just popped in here this morning. It's always super packed, so I was happy to see it not so busy on a Sunday morning. The space is really beautiful - amazing wood paneling that creates a great vintage tavern feel. There are no real spots to sit, but a thin bar that goes around the whole space to stand at. The atmosphere is very true to the types of tapa places you would stumble onto in Spain, it really is like a spot at the Rastro in Madrid. I had a cafe solo to go, which was absolutely delicious. The food looked amazing - they have many of the tapas displayed, which makes choosing easier. Again, loads of traditional Spanish options - bacaloa on toast, sardines with peppers, octopus in oil etc., Oh and of course jamon! I'll be back to eat, the only downside is this place is already so popular it's nearly impossible to get in."}
{"text":"the best tapas place in toronto.  the décor is really quite something. it's hard to explain. it's what i'd imagine a bar to be like in lothlorien.   all the food is great and you'll probably want to order everything.   if you can, go in the afternoon when things are calmer."}
{"text":"Bar Raval doesn't take reservations.  Their tapas are excellent with a good variety.  I would highly recommend the Spanish Iberco, aged for 36 month and finished in acorn.  Mixed drinks are fancy, very unique.  Has an excellent spirit selection with the rare pappy 23 years."}
{"text":"Good food. Nicely displayed jn an architecture that reminds of Barcelona and Tapas Bars in Spain. After a Long wait to get in (1 hour), we found that there were no chairs to sit when we were called in. We were only offered the bar to stand up. After some more negotiation, we were able to grab chairs from exiting customers. Service was not bad, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I really love Bar Raval; it is one of my favourite spots in Toronto.  Interior is very beautiful; it is a stand-up bar, and there are very limited bar chairs if you can get one. Ambiance is very causal; music is a little loud. The place is small, and it is very intimate (because you either need to shout loud to talk to your friend or speak in your friend's ear).  Food is amazing; menu changes regularly, but some of the signature items remain on the menu. My favorite is the hot octopus; it is so flavourful and tender. The canned seafood is the must try item as well. During the morning/early afternoon, dishes/pastry will be displayed at the bar table and you can just choose and bring back to your table.   Service is very friendly; you can feel they love their job and love you to be there. I feel being welcome during my every visit."}
{"text":"I've never been to a stand-up bar, but it really worked. The food was great - highly recommend the croquettes, shishito peppers and eggplant - and the cocktails were equally good. Highly recommend you check out this cute little bar!"}
{"text":"A busy stop on College. This is one of those places that is full all the time, you better reserve a table (not sure if they take reservations though) or come before the peak hours, which is basically after work.   There are several tables outside looking onto College St. And some more on the other side of the intersection. Inside has a very tasteful decoration, dim lights, good vibes and a cheerful atmosphere. The sitting setup is mostly composed on bar stools. It's not hard to guess that you will have hard time to move around once the place is packed because the tables (or barrels, because the tables are actually large barrels) are somehow close to each other.   And now the menu. I agree with most of the reviews saying that this place is not cheap. I ordered bread with fresh tomatoes $5 and sobrassada & eggplant $8,5. Don't get me wrong, the food is heavenly delicious, especially the eggplant that had a sweet balsamic sauce with a bacony paste underneath the cheese. However the price should be around $6-7 for such portion. Or at least if you could get 3 pcs instead of 2 that'd be great too.   Bottled wines start from $40, you can also get a glass of sparkling rose or white at $8. Based on the reviews, I went for Octopus a la Planxa, soft pcs of octopus legs along with potatoes in olive oil. It was good too, but I can't say the best octopus I ever had. Still, not chewy and being softer marinated in a tasty juice tells me they nailed it.   The service was good enough for me, waiters wandering in and out of the place, almost ready to take your order...  And without forgetting the delicious Pollard Punch, an epic cocktail with cinnamon, black tea and pineapple served with ice. Can't recommend it enough. That was the best part of the night. They also have several interesting cocktails on the menu too, go try something you haven't had before, you can't go wrong experimenting their drinks.   Overall, it's a nice place, atmospheric with good food and drinks, not on the cheaper side. The tapas Bars Ive been to in Spain were a lot cheaper and offered many different specialities for a reasonable price. Of course there are classier options too, promising a blend of tastes in your mouth, which I think what Bar Raval is competing in. A satisfying visit for Tapas, especially after a long work day."}
{"text":"Great drinks but limited seating. Will get packed Saturday night so come early. My choice is the Absinthe minded. This cocktail goes down like juice so keep em coming!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Grant Van Gameren's cuisine, I've been meaning to check this place out since it opened, and I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed.   Before I outlined all the things I love about Bar Raval, here are a few things to keep in mind: - No, they do not take reservations - Yes, you are most likely to stand up throughout the meal! - No, this would not be a cheap meal.  Having said that, the rest of my experience at Bar Raval was a delight. For starters, the space is gorgeous. The walls and ceiling are adorned with amazing woodwork in the style of Art Nouveau, or Gaudi. They apparently spent over $200,000 on the woodwork alone and the result is spectacular. So, in terms of the space and the ambiance, this place is super hip, attractive and romantic, perfectly suited for that special second date.   The service is very good. Numerous staff members, from bartenders to waitresses attend to your every need, and are ready to be accommodating and to offer recommendations.   At Bar Raval they are serious about their drinks, and offer some exceptional cocktails. You are looking at $15 on a cocktail, but they are so unique and flavorful, they are part and parcel of the dining experience, so I do recommend you splurge on a cocktail. Besides, you get 2-2.5 oz for that price. I asked one of the helpful staff to recommend a drink based on my preferences, and he suggested a cocktail with a mix of tequila, mezcal, peach schnapps and bitters. It was intense and smoky and beautiful.   The food all around was most delicious. Keep in mind that many of the dishes are heavy, with big bold flavors of savoury, salty, oily and smoky. So try to balance things out by ordering some lighter fresher dishes. Here is a recap of what we ordered (in order of most to least favorite)  Tuna Belly and Melon ----------------------------- Rating: 5/5 Beautiful, light and refreshing dish. The morsels of tuna belly melt in your mouth, while the melon, cucumber and mint are the perfect accompaniment of refreshing sweetness and crunchiness.  This was my favorite dish of the evening.  Sweetbreads (Special) ------------------------------ Rating: 5/5 Exceptionally tasty battered and deep fried sweetbread. Served with root vegetables, prosciutto  and (slightly overly heavy-handed) cream sauce. This was my second favorite dish of the evening.   Smoked Mackerel ------------------------ Rating: 5/5 A generous portion of perfectly smoked mackerel.  Choricitos ------------- Rating: 5/5 Beautiful sausage. Fatty, smoky and spicy in all the right ways.   Octopus ----------- Rating: 4/5 Very tasty and tender octopus. They could have been a little more playful with the flavor.   Pork Cheeks ----------------- Rating: 3/5 This was not my favorite dish. The meat was a little too porky. Still a decent dish.   I would like to revisit Bar Raval with a larger group of people so we could order almost everything off the menu so I could try it all ;-) In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger... I'll be back..."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:00 pm on a Saturday to a packed bar. We were lucky to snag a spot with stools as a few people were leaving. The bar is mostly standing room, with a few stools here and there. I think the set up is different, and makes sense from the restaurant's point of view to make sure there is a good client turnover. Just be warned that wearing heels is probably not the best idea! I absolutely adore the aesthetic of the bar, finished largely in wood. It is quaint and romantic - perfect for a date night.   We weren't overly hungry, so we started with some cocktails. I first tried the Tinto Fino ($13), with Tio Pepe Fino (dry sherry). I really enjoyed this drink because it was quite sour and tangy. For those looking for a sweet drink, this isn't the one for you My husband tried Into the Sun ($15), and it was okay. It didn't have a lot of flavour for a craft cocktail. My husband then tried the Palm Springs Pawn Shop ($15), which he enjoyed more. We decided to have a few snacks and ordered Octopus ($14.25) and Croquetas ($8). The Croquetas were filled with cheese and ham, and were rich and delicious (although not served piping hot). The Octopus was quite good and was served with two pieces of bread. Not the best I ever had, but was decent.   Overall, I would return for the cocktails and great atmosphere, but I think that the food is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and was so disappointed. I just moved back to Canada after living in Barcelona so I was craving Spanish tapas and pintxos. Firstly the server comes to take our drink order so naturally I ask for sangria and she tells me they don't have sangria. I'm sorry but what kind of Spanish restaurant doesn't serve sangria- that should be illegal. Then looking at the menu the tapas selection was so odd. They didn't have some classic tapas like garlic shrimp or patatas bravas. Again, how can you be a Spanish restaurant and not have patatas bravas. Also the pintxos selection was so disappointing. This place is called Bar Raval and right next to Raval in Barcelona is Poble Sec with the best pintxos street. Creative and unique pintxos and this restaurant thinks Jamón and Manchego is worthy of being on the menu. Not to mention two pintxos is $9. Excuse me pintxos are supposed to be 1 euro. Overall this restaurant is insulting to Spanish cuisine. Not sure if the owner is Spanish but I can only safely assume it's owned by some guy who visited Barcelona for a week. Disappointing!!! The inside is nice with Gaudí inspired wood so that's why I gave this 2 stars. Not that the design makes any sense since none of Gaudís buildings are in Raval."}
{"text":"I read about Bar Raval's interior space months ago and was really eager to see it and try some tapas, but unfortunately for me I'm neither hip, trendy or worldly enough to appreciate the experience. I love the interior, it was real interesting, and I felt like I was in a treehouse,   But besides that, while I ate I grew to the realization that tapas are an endangered species in Canada. They are at risk of extinction since only a handful of restaurants will take a gamble and make tapas their bread and butter throughout the week but charge a plate as if it were a full size meal. (That \"full\" feeling you get after a few tapas isn't really you feeling sated, it's just all the fish oil and olive oil sitting in your stomach.)  I'm not hip because I went on a Saturday afternoon so I didn't experience the place on a weeknight and didn't give myself a reason to order a drink. I'm also not hip because I didn't know it was a standing room restaurant.  Besides my lack of an undercut and a sleeve tattoo (pardon me, I meant \"personal ink\"), I'm not trendy because everything we ordered on the menu or read on the menu I've either made at home before, or have seen in the grocery aisle (tinned squid in ink is $7.99 and all you have to do is possess a finger and thumb to open the tin yourself at home). Olives, Spanish olive oil, kettle cooked chips, pricey anchovies, a slice of baguette...basically a WholeFoods shopping list I'd spend my holiday bonus on. For a cheap night-in, I toss quail eggs with fresh tomatoes, onion, and basil onto some stale toast and call it bruschetta. But you know, that ain't a real tapa...just creative cooking in the dull domestic kitchen.  Admittedly, I just didn't appreciate the experience or the price, and I'm too practical an oddball to agree with most of the positive reviews for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I think I like Bar Raval. I think I had a good time.  I think I ate:  Chicken Liver Mousse with Rhubarb Squid on Black Rice  They tasted good.  The place was packed even on a weekday and there was a line trying to get in when I was leaving.  I think I need to go back again and try out their tapas and cocktails again. I do need to invite Danica C as she was such a good host and it was the first time we went out together.  PS It was never a good idea to have a cider flight before meeting your friends as those sweet cider can made someone really drunk by 3 pm."}
{"text":"Toronto needs more places like Bar Raval, but if they existed, then it wouldn't be so special."}
{"text":"Great bread and steak. The dishes are all full of flavors and textures. The ingredients all go well with each other in a synergistic way. Beautiful place and great service. Definitely much better than the Dailo beside, although not the same kind of food."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Keep in mind this is not a sit down restaurant. There is no chair! It's truly a Spanish tapas and the food is really good. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This bar is beautiful (I think there's a country song that basically has this in their lyrics. BUT THIS IS LIKE THE BARCELONA-INSPIRED VERSION, K?).  Bar Raval, I want to go on all the dates and all the girls' nights and all the hangs with my Ma IN YOU. Is that too much? You are gorgeous and your staff is super friendly and the food is perfect and different and exciting without making me feel heavy.  All the iberico and scallops and mushroom towers and smoked mackerel and shishitos please. Down it with some perfectly constructed cocktails.   In sum: you make me feel happy. And kindasorta like I'm on vacation in my own city.  Yelp note: no reservations but - opening at 8am - it's easy to find some off-peak times to hit it up"}
{"text":"High expectations were met. Slow service but the food made up for that. You probably won't understand anything on the menu, but the waiters will be happy to explain what it actually means. Beautiful decor and great location."}
{"text":"Typical Grant restaurant. Phenomenal. Service was great! Wish it was hot enough to sit outside but the interiors are also fabulous anyway."}
{"text":"Food and drink: Went for cocktails only; I had the Scarlet Carson. It was good but not a standout cocktail in my opinion.  Service and atmosphere: Lives up to its reputation for having neat interior architecture. The wood art encompasses the entire bar and is very unique for Toronto. It is however a very small place (20-30 people); the cozy vibe is great, but also means it can be a long wait (45-90 minutes on a Saturday night) and stand-up tables. Luckily, they have a heated patio though that does the trick, even in the winter."}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous! The interior is actually amazing, even though the place itself is not very big. My friend and I were sitting in the closed patio, which is not actually closed, but had heating, so at the time it was fine (however, it did get pretty cold after an hour of sitting there). The food is amazing, both my friend and I loved it. Also, as someone who drinks coffee and lattes all the time I don't often get impressed by its taste, but their latte was really something different!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval is the right place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.The food here is very good. I had about 7 tapas and all of them were really tasty. It is hard to choose if you don't know the names of the dishes but we had food and surprise in one.  If you want to get to Barcelona without any travel time, this is the place that will give you the vibe."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bar Isabel so I was very excited to try out Bar Raval. I went for lunch over the weekend and got to sit on the patio. The food was just as expected, delicious! There was a minor mistake with one of our orders, and the staff and Chef were so apologetic that they sent out an additional complimentary dish. I also got to try the donuts and they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Bartender ignored us till we ordered drinks from one of the women picking up plates. She was great. He was rude. Also pigs head? It's pork mate. It's shaved pork."}
{"text":"i've been in the early morning, i've been late at night, and i've confirmed that there's no wrong time of day for boquerones and stracciatella.   drinks are great, food is great, ambiance is neighbourhood-ly and friendly. get ready to make friends if you're standing at the barrels.   decor makes you feel like you've either fell down the rabbit hole, or maybe wandered into bilbo's place in the shire."}
{"text":"Txakoli all night long.  I don't think there is a better wine to drink with all their seafood based Tapas.  We had a few bottles along with the Galician Octopus and some Scallops.   They have the correct pouring technique and everything.    The basque tradition alive and well in Toronto. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bar Raval has been and still is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto for many years now. Located near Bathurst and College, this busy eatery is a Spanish tapas restaurant where the interior/bar area is inspired by Gaudi. The restaurant has a low-key, hip, and relaxed vibe where customers are there to have a good time - grab a drink and a few bites to eat and you know you're in for a treat. Their drinks and menu changes slightly ever so often but the classics remain.   One of my most favourite tapas dishes to order is the Stracciatella & Boquerones. The saltiness of the anchovies and the cheese make for a delicious combination of flavours and textures with the grilled bread. The kitchen bread is also simple yet satisfying, another classic! You can't go wrong with the food here.   Overall, the my experiences of eating at Bar Raval brings me back to my travels in Barcelona (where tapas places are sometimes standing room only). Service at this eatery is friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed and comforting, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We came on a rainy Saturday night and was told around 1 hour wait. We waited outside for 20 minutes, went to Shopper Drug Mart down the street to pick up a few things, and came back to check on the wait. The hostess told us she would be able to squeeze us in, but when we walked in, there were many many empty tables. Standing only!  Everything we got was amazing.   - Shrimp and Romanesco. MUST GET! Sooooo good, the shrimp was very flavorful and well balanced.  - Kitchen bread-- really good with the anchovy - Fig special -- made me rediscover my love for the buttery sweetness of figs - Hot octopus -- very well cooked - Skirt steak -- least favorite dish, but very filling."}
{"text":"SO SO SO good. Nice selection of vermouth, and also very tasty tapas. We loved the boquerones. Awesome atmosphere for grabbing a drink a small bites, their outdoor area is great in the summer."}
