{"text":"My favourite sandwich spot in the city. I go here regularly and was surprised to see the lack of yelp reviews.  The staff is very friendly and the owner is quite meticulous/caring when creating sandwiches. My go to is the smoked salmon with coleslaw and avocado + roasted garlic spread on ancient grain."}
{"text":"They've moved! To University, right at Richmond.  Opened today and I went to check it out as the name suggested to me that they had salads. And they did - a make your own salad bar, price by weight.  Only cons were none of the food is labelled, so if you have allergies who the heck knows what anything is. And the price for the salad wasn't even posted.  Otherwise, good selection, fresh and delicious. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Tough review to write.  First, I will say that I am here almost every single day for lunch.  I previously would pick up salads at the Rabba on Simcoe, but they started being mostly just spinach and almost no toppings, so I was excited when something new opened up equally close by.  My first issue that I have is the cleanliness of the \"salad bar\".  The tongs are always scattered all over the place, so handles are actually ending up in the food containers, which means everyone's germy, winterty hands are going all over the food.  There are no food labels and cross contamination is all over the place, so if you have an allergy, stay away.  They used to have a lot more selection and now it's just the same toppings again and again.  Sometimes, especially by Friday, they don't look so fresh or new anymore.    The prepackaged beet/goat cheese salad is pretty good, and so is the weird \"chia yogurt\" concoction they have.  I've only ever had soup one time (usually the flavours don't appeal to me at ), it was a tomato soup, the small size looks REALLY SMALL but it was a good amount, very very salty, and came with a slice of olive bread (wasn't given a choice of bread).  The line is confusing (you are supposed to line up to order sandwiches but if you have something just to pay for, like pre-packaged or salad bar, you can skip the line - there should be signage for this).  The girl who does the checkout is friendly and often helps me close my salad container (SO HARD TO CLOSE!), but the dude who owns the restaurant/the manager is not friendly - to me.  He's very friendly to everyone else.  He literally has never said \"hi\" to me or smiled at me or acknowledged me, often looking right past me and saying hi to someone else in line, even though I'm there every day.  This has irked me since the beginning.  I tried some varied approaches - smiling at him first, looking him in the eyes, etc - but nada.  I am not sure what that's about although I have theories.  Today he gave the woman ahead of me who was buying LESS than me a plastic bag with handles, and when I asked for a bag, they gave me a paper bag (it was pouring rain out).  So....that's not great."}
{"text":"A coworker and I stopped in for a quick lunch during my recent business trip to Toronto.  Green Box is conveniently located on the ground level of our office building.  I enjoyed a whole wheat panini with ham, provolone, tomatoes and dijon mustard with a side salad.  The food was fresh,  healthy and super tasty.  Definitely a great place to pick-up or dine in a quick lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"This is my first ever review and I am So happy It's for my fav lunch spot. This place was previously located inside a small convenience store on queen. A hidden gem. I was blown away then by the service and quality. And now that they have grown and moved to Their new location their service and quality has only gotten better.   I go at least 3 times a week for a sandwich and salad. As a vegan I find it really hard to find quick and delicious places I can go to that also don't break the bank. They offer a huge variety of sandwich options for anyone. Omnivore and vegans alike. the most delicious breads as well. They always have vegan option and a meat option for soup too if salad isn't your thing.   If giant salads are your thing have no fear. They have the biggest salad bar to build your own I have ever seen. I tried to get a pic but it was so busy I couldn't get the whole bar in the shot lol.   Since moving they also added a coffee bar and freshly Baked goods that look super enticing when paying but I have yet to try.   The staff treat the customers amazing. I have been here so many times and it doesn't matter how busy it is they are efficient and always treat their guests with such a nice cheery atmosphere. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. The store's decor is so pretty and IG worthy. They also offer a wide range of healthy and delicious food options. Prices are reasonable. I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Great, cheap, workday lunch spot that is a total hidden gem at the back of a convenience shop.   There's a massive salad bar where you pay by weight. I love the wide selection of ingredients. Includes options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and/or vegans. Lettuces are very fresh which is a good indicator of quality.   There's also a sandwich station with a great selection of fresh bread and sandwich toppings.   This is a great place for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Ultimate and yes, this is the Sandwich Box.  There just moved SW corner of University/Richmond."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden under-rated gem for breakfast/lunch in the financial district.   I've had their avo toast and it's excellent! Also, the egg sandwiches and the almond croissants are the best I've had in the city (better than Maman's and that's saying a lot). The quality of their ingredients is excellent esp their breads.   For lunch, I've had the salad bar and they have a good selection of items.   Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was walking along with my friend on Queen street when she suddenly said: \"hey do you like sandwiches?\" A hesitant \"yes...?\" later, we were standing in front of the salad bar, but only after she had said \"I know it sounds really weird, but this convenience store has great sandwiches and salads... just trust me.\"  She wasn't kidding. This place is: a) confusing b) questionable on the outside c) a convenience store d) delicious e) all of the above  Actually kind of reminds me of the sandwich box. The sandwich setup is very similar -- you get to pick what goes on your sandwich out of a list of meats and vegetables. We both went for the salad bar, which is self-serve pay-by-weight with an impressive spread of offerings: fresh spinach, arugula, and greens; huge marinated mushroom slices, cooked broccoli, and large chunky slices of creamy avocado; grilled chicken strips, seasoned tofu, edamame, and corn...  Can you believe that salad was so filling I couldn't even finish it? Wonderful find, with the heart-warming moral of trusting your friends."}
{"text":"One of the few build-your-own sandwiches in the area, from great bread to an abundance of meats, veggies, and cheese, meals come at an affordable price with a salad. I would just hope they had combination suggestions for those that don't know where to start. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for fresh, filling, and delicious custom-order sandwiches! With a wide selection of bread, toppings, sauce and extras, my usual favorite is the smoked salmon on panini bread with chipotle mayo and goat cheese. I love smoked salmon so this is the BEST sandwich I find myself ordering regularly. Plus, when you order a combo with their amazing salad, it makes for a healthy and very satisfying meal. Definitely great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Standard place serving healthy sandwiches made with fresh ingredients. I liked the build your own sandwich option - I tried the smoked salmon on a ciabatta bread with some fresh veggies. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing - met expectations. For the price I paid, I was hoping to get more salmon and an overall more filling meal.. Let's say I was still hungry and I was able to grab another lunch at a Thai place nearby within an hour and a half.   This place isn't bad at all.   Oh and don't buy water.. they give free cups of lime water which was great and refreshing."}
