{"text":"The soup suggests that the food is not that bad. However...Saltiest food I've ever had. Tres horrible. I had the Portuguese baked chicken on rice. Had bones in it and salty patches. My friend had the baked pork chop on rice. Same deal. And my other friend had the hainese chicken. The chicken was equally salty. Now time for rehydration"}
{"text":"B & B Cafe Restaurant is a Hong Kong Style Cafe located in a plaza right beside Pierre Elliot Trudeau High School. It serves up your usual \"cha chan tang\" food.   Decor:   Upon walking in, the restaurant looks pretty small. Booth seats along the side and some tables in the middle (around 3 in the middle, to give you an idea of the size). The decor is pretty drab, dull colors etc. However, at the same time it has that more old school feel to it that other HK cafes don't have. Along the wall there are specials taped up (though cause of my bad Chinese reading skills, I didn't know what they were). This added even more of an old school feel to it.  In the booth seats the \"back\" (where your back rests upon) was not cushioned so that wasn't really comfortable. But thankfully, the seat was and it wasn't too cramped. The restaurant looks clean enough, not too dirty but I do suspect that where the floor meets the wall it may have been dirty. The lighting is pretty good, it isn't too dark nor too bright.  Score: 3.2  Service:  At first, the service seemed to be your typical Chinese restaurant service, competent, quick etc. And while they do fulfill this perfectly. I noticed that despite this was the first time we came they were already a bit nice to us, something I don't usually notice in HK cafes.  Score: 3.4   Food:  Personally, considering myself as a Hainanese chicken connoisseur I had to try their Hainanese chicken rice. Coming at $6.99 (and including soup and drink) it was pretty cheap but I was concerned that the quality would be lacking.   The soup that came with it wasn't your typical HK cafe soup (Chinese borscht etc.) But rather a more traditional Chinese soup. Didn't know the name as they just called it Chinese soup but the flavour of the soup was very familiar. It had a nice meaty and salty taste (though too salty for me). And had a piece of wintermelon and carrot which was nice.   When the dish came it looked like a big plate of food, and it pretty much was.When served my parents noted that it was a more canto style of this dish, maybe the reason why there were a number of differences in this Hainanese chicken dish?The choy sum/gai lan (can't remember which one it was) was average, there wasn't really enough Hoisin sauce for all of it so most of it was bland. I dislike raw ginger so naturally, I disliked the pickled ginger slices (as they had that raw taste). The ginger and onion sauce was very good though, it added much flavour to the chicken. Only thing I wish for is that it was served on the side rather than on the dish itself. The chicken was pretty decent, it had some flavour, but obviously needed the ginger and onion sauce to add that extra \"umph\". The rice was something different, it was flavoured however no in the usual way. Instead I think it was flavoured with some kind of curry paste? It had that curry color and flavour. The flavour was toned down a bit so it didn't get overpowered. However, at times there were clumps of paste not thoroughly distributed throughout the rice. The price for portions was definitely good however it was the quality/taste that was just a bit lacking.  I got a hot lemon tea for a drink and it was average, wasn't bad however, it wasn't good at the same time.   Score: 3.75  Final Score: 3.45"}
{"text":"This review is purely on their breakfast:  The food at this cafe is alright..... I come here because they open for breakfast really early in the morning.   The food is nothing spectacular but it fills you up for $6  Husband always gets a club sandwich, which they do a pretty awesome job making.    The crowd is generally regulars but one visit there was a couple who verbally were going to kill each other colored with a number of profane Chinese words.   They made the restaurant feel extremely uncomfortable.   The staff did not ask them to leave or to keep their voices down."}
{"text":"Students rejoice! To those looking for a cheap and fast eatery this is your place (in fact this is your plaza). This place and the surrounding restaurants are obviously banking on the high school kids right next door. That's about the only thing worth mentioning about this place.  Food is mediocre but the value is amazing! Oh yeah, you do get a pretty mundane coconut ice red bean drink with every meal (amazing!).  Come here if you are really broke or.... you are really broke? Yeah."}
{"text":"I just walk into any restaurant in this plaza and choose this one. Order the salted chicken fried rice. Surprisingly it is really good. I can tasted a lot of salted fish which some restaurant can't even find it. Now I'm going to order a fishball in noodle soup!"}
{"text":"A decent HK style cafe. Tried the satay beef with noodles. The sauce was too strong in taste. A decent amount of beef and a good portion overall. Also tried the baked cream sauce spaghetti with shrimps and squid. Came with lots of shrimps but they were very small. Noodles were done right and I liked the cream sauce which had a nice melted layer of cheese on top."}
{"text":"It is certainly cheap. Some of my friends said, at this cost you certainly can't ask for much. I look for \"cheap\" \"good\" food that also look appealing. Compare to ??? and some other ones, it seem to lack a bit of quality and quantity.  Fried chicken wings and fries with only 3 wings, others will give you 4 to 6 wings for the same price. The wings at B&B are over fried, which makes it too dry, and fries are not crispy enough.  The iced lemon tea that I ordered come with together with the wings and fried as a combo only has 3 slices of lemon.  Many better ones out there comes with 4 slices. What I found is only 4 slices can give enough taste. Service is not bad, but not good neither.  I expect smaller restaurants like these should give you a sense of welcoming attitude, we are the only table, and I don't feel that I am welcome.  Price can be cheap but not the food, service determines how cheap the restaurant is.  If you want to stuff your stomach at minimal cost, B&B is an option, but don't expect much."}
{"text":"Hate to do this to a small family run restaurant, but after having a solid 3 star breakfast here my friend and I came back for dinner. One thing I have learned is you shouldn't go to a Hong Kong like restaurant for a Canadian like meal.  Now don't get me wrong, the service, portions and price are great here, and maybe some of their traditional Asian dishes are better here, but avoid ordering the steak. Hands down the worst steak I had ever eaten in my life. Zero flavour, fatty and just plain horrible. If I come back here I will not be eating anything that I would on the menu of  The Keg, or similar restaurants..."}
{"text":"Your typical chinese cafe - BUT not so typical because compared to the other ones this place is actually quite good! Their cold lemon honey water is my absolute fav! Nowhere and I mean nowhere makes it as good as they do! Definitely try it! Their rice dishes are pretty good as well. Fast, cheap, delicious, clean eat ! ^.^"}
{"text":"B & B Cafe Restaurant is another one of those Hong Kong Style Restaurants in the area...   Fast and convenient and you can get in and out of the restaurant in 15 minutes!! Great if you are in a rush and just want something fast and cheap.   Afternoon tea starts at 2:00 pm... however the menu is a little limited to mostly deep fried items... So I decide to go order:   Beef Brisket and Wonton Rice Noodle Soup with coffee/tea ($5.25)  - Fresh rice noodle is used instead of the dried type  - Beef brisket has good flavour and quite tender  - Wonton are smallish..and quite bland... meh   Not my first choice but has plenty of free parking.   Even for the high school students, B & B Cafe is not their first choice... for them is just kind of uncool to eat here? :) So good for me as I can have some quiet time!"}
{"text":"This is an add on to my original review.  We ordered 2 rice entr√©es from the lunch menu last Saturday.  There was noticeable improvement in the taste of the food.   The portion was not as huge, but it was sufficient.  Overall rating is still 3 stars."}
{"text":"Don't set you expectations too high and you'll never leave hungry.  Standard hk style cafe."}
