{"text":"I am asian, I love \"the pho\", and I visited this establishment with a Vietnamese co-worker.  

Some notes - a small for 5.50 is not exactly expensive, but it's definitely more expensive than any small I've had around the 'saug.  On top of that, I was hungry enough after my meal to line up and ask about the subs (I found out it was the size of a palm, cut up beef, and expensive - 2.85- and went for a donut instead...).

The broth was definitely not greasy or fatty enough, and lacked the distinctive pho-broth taste.  It actually tasted rather watered down and much too clear, like it was mixed from water and instant powder instead of slow-boiled over the stove for hours.

The beef was not very fatty at all and was rather thinly sliced and tough.  The noodles were also very under-cooked to the point of being al-dente... first time I've had pho al-dente, but my coworker assured me that is not how they should be.

The service was very fast, and it was self-serve limes, sauces, and utensils.  It was different using a metal spoon instead of a ceramic soup spoon, and there was a serious lack of bean sprouts.

All in all, the price isn't terrible, but for that amount, I've had much better pho.

No comment on the other meals (rice, fried rice, vermi, etc.)"}
{"text":"When I say that Ginger at Church and Wellesley is my favourite Ginger in the city, technically it's a lie - it's really this one. It's always been this one. But I moved away from it, and then they changed their name, and life has never been the same. 

Once upon a time I lived on Gerrard, a short saunter away from what was once called Ginger 2. I found myself eating dinner here two times a week on average, because they do quick, cheap vietnamese food quite well. 

As I just discovered after two years of a Ginger 2-less life, Green Fusion is now the name of the game, but the menu remains the same. (Freee style RHYMES!) Order at the cash, take a number and find a seat. Benches are prime spots but it's always nice to sit in the window too. By the time you grab water, chop sticks and a dixie cup 'o hot sauce, the food is on your table. I'm all about the soup (chicken noodle or hot & sour tofu) or the curry tofu vermicelli. If I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll get a cold spring roll too - tofu and avocado being my fave. Or if I'm feeling naughty, a fresh fruit shake. Cold mango beverage = dream.

It's not fancy, but it's CHEAP and way fast. And so dang tasty (like your face)."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about but not much to complain about either.  Prices were pretty low and the portions were decent sized.  

Food came out quick and tasted good; not great.  

There are plenty of noodle dishes, soup dishes, and rice dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"There's nothing flash about the surroundings, but the food is really decent and fresh, and the prices are nicely cheap. Can't speak for the Pho, but the vegetarian Bun dishes I have tried are fantastic (just ask for no fish sauce and they're happy to oblige). 

I work nearby and drop down for lunch frequently, and it's also a livesaver during TIFF if you're seeing a lot of films at Ryerson!"}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, I was pleasently surprised.  We had pho, which I liked.  It was just the way I like it.  It was tastey, not watery, but not too fatty.  My daughters shared the grilled chicken over vermacelli and spring rolls and they really liked it as well.  For the price, the food is pretty darn good.
As far as the restaurant goes, this is straight up one filthy place.  I'm talking dirty.  The restroom made me want to barf and I'm not just saying that because I'm prego.  There was a bottle of oxiclean in the bathroom on top of the hand dryer.  I took it as them saying, \"If you don't like nasty, here's a bottle of cleaner.  Clean it yourself.\"  GROSS!

So if you don't mind the filth, the food is good.  I'm sure if the restaurant is dirty, then the kitchen is equally as nasty. . .your decision."}
{"text":"Here is what one would call a cheap persons heaven. Seriously, I find the prices ridiculous cheap.

Now, there's a warning I have to give you: use the washroom at your home before you go here. Almost made me sick. 

Ok. Now to the food. For the price you can't really complain. It comes to you quickly after you pay at the cafeteria style counter.  It is about cheap food fast here. Not much of anything else including customer service.

I had number 28.  Pork, spring roll on vermicelli. It's not bad. i have definitely had better flavours but the size was reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"As someone always on the hunt for a good vietnamese sandy, I decided to give Green Fusion a try. 

As a vegetarian, I am always comparing the tofu sandy's and find that most places make them a little differently. Green Fusion has their tofu in a tomato sauce, which I did enjoy. Their prices are GREAT (4.25 for a sandy and a pop) and the portion sizes were decent. 

Overall, a great little place to stop in for a quick lunch or dinner. It definitely isn't fine dining, but this place has plenty of room to have a seat and chow down!"}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful.  You don't come here for the decor; it's shabby.  But the food is good, plentiful and cheap!  Staff are very nice, food served very quickly.  It is always busy at lunch, best to arrive before noon.  Excellent shakes, fresh rolls are addictive (try the beef!).  Lots of vegetarian options.  One of my favourite lunch places.  They will do take out as well."}
{"text":"Not the best place to eat. I found the restaurant to be quite dirty. The floor was sticky, chair cushions had rips in them, and the overall restaurant setting was dark and musky. But the customer service was good, and dishes were ready within five minutes.

I had the beef pho at Green Fusion, with a vegetarian spring roll. The vegetarian spring roll was actually amazing. I highly recommend it, however, the beef pho was underwhelming. I found it to have a really strong taste that masked everything else. 

If you are looking for cheap dining near Yonge and Dundas, this is the place."}
{"text":"why is this place good? Because it's cheap.

why is this place bad? alot of the food is flavourless and the tables may be sticky.


you decide. you are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great, quite cheap and quick-on-your-table food with very friendly staff.

Come, sit, eat and go (do not spend to much time looking at the table, floor, do not explore the bathrooms, do not look at the windows, do not touch anything else than your fork and food, use your own hand cleaner liquid if you have one, eat, enjoy, be happy, smile and go back to work - or shopping, and you will be happy and safe... and will think to go back there soon!!)"}
{"text":"I just went tonight and found the place looking more rundown than ever. The floor was really sticky and everything just seems more run-down looking possibly because of the inadequate lighting. Not a place to take a take that's for sure.

Anyway, food is served pretty quick (~5 minutes) and I had the pork vermicelli on my table in no time. It was a bit disappointing this time so I had to downgrade my rating by 1 star. The pork had a LOT of fat, it was really salty and the vermicelli were wet and soft. The other times I had the beef vermicelli and it was pretty good so I'll give this place another chance later."}
