{"text":"Place wasn't too busy and food was prepared relatively quickly. I had the spicy pad Thai which was Alright but nothing spectacular. I will be back to try their other dishes"}
{"text":"$5-7 for a good noodle dish. They are very polite and quite quick. I've never seen it very busy in there either. There are a few small clean tables and nice posters on the walls. They're the best noodle dishes I've found in Mississauga, especially considering it's basically fast food. Big portions too!

I can't find their menu info anywhere so here it is for reference...
There are 10 choices: 
1. Spicy teriyaki
2. Sweet and spicy
3. Pineapple curry
4. Garlic and ginger
5. Szechuan
6. Spicy Thai
7. Teriyaki
8. Kung pao
9. Spicy peanut
10. Pad Thai

Each option lets you pick vegetarian, soya, chicken, beef, or tiger shrimp."}
{"text":"Fast and clean food. I tried the chicken Teryaki and it was amazing. I waited about 5 minutes. It was cooked on the spot."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fast, fresh and friendly, this is the place. Oh and of course you want noodles. The place is  very clean. And you cannot beat the price. Between 5.00 and 7.00. Six dumplings for 3.99 and miso soup is 1.77 or something close. And they will make you choice as spicy as you like. I personally love spicy hot."}

I remember seeing this listing on Yelp and as I was driving by, I saw the sign so I went into the plaza. 

Best way to describe this place: A cross between Freshii and Thai Express.  

1. They have 10 different flavours plus some other set dishes like dumplings, miso soup, etc.  

2. Choose your flavour (i.e. curry, sweet & sour, pad thai, etc...I don't remember the flavours) from # 1 to #10 or choose a set dish. 

3. Choose your meat (veggie, beef, pork, soy, chicken)

4. Choose your carb (Chinese noodles, egg noodles or rice noodles). 

I got the veggie pineapple curry on Chinese noodles.  The curry was sweet and fragrant. All the veggies were fresh.  I thought there was a bit too much sauce, but I eat very plain food but I think for normal people, this would be the perfect amount.  Also, the price of my dish was $6.19 + tax which is fairly cheap for a generous portion.  

I think the ones with meat cost around $8.

All in all, this is a good healthy fast food place...if that makes any sense."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Fast noodles that are so delicious!!! Price is right too. Pretty much like a Thai express but cheaper."}
