{"text":"After seeing the good reviews I was surprised of how terrible their food was. I am going to list all of the pizza places that have worst food, now get ready to read a long list. None. As far I am concerned they really went out of their way to make the smallest calzone for the price that I payed. They will have to bribe me to go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this pizza place. Quick orders (we do pick up, usually snag it on the way home from work).  Perfect sauce, cheese, and topping ratios.  Love their sauce.  Crust is chewy and well done, never that \"semi-done\" crap you get from some places that put too much on the pizza and it's not cooked all the way.  Price is reasonable.  Seriously enjoy this place.  My husband tells me they have a unique candy selection inside, so that's enough to earn his approval, unfortunately.  So far, we've only gotten plain old pizza there, can't wait to try their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Told me 10 min for two slices and a drink for $5. Waited 20. Never got it bc I only get a half hour lunch break so I had to leave. She told me it would be 10 more min. Don't advertise pizza by the slice if you don't have it ready."}
{"text":"We ordered from E. M. frequently, and as long as we don't order an actual pizza, we're fine. The last couple of pizzas were just awful: crappy pre-fab crust with a two inch wide edge. The salads and sandwiches and everything else are just great. The other lost star is for the order fulfillment process. At least half of the time, if not a bit more, we don't get what we ordered. Missing drinks, wrong dressing, wrong toppings.  We're taking a break from them for a while."}
{"text":"There are tons of pizza options in the south hills. This place is the closest to my house so my boyfriend and I randomly tried it a year or so ago and loved it! Now we get take out here regularly.   EM is unique considering when you go inside you will notice they are a Russian mini mart as well as a pizza /gyro place (interesting right?!) so not only can you get delicious pizza there, but you can grab a unique snack that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else! I have even just walked around and looked at their unique items while they were making my pizza! They are family owned and have awesome customer service- always friendly and helpful.   The pizza is delicious- sauce is packed with flavorful and the cheese is wonderful. I like the crust but sometimes find it too doughy for my liking.   Save your receipts! Save 10 and get your next pizza free :)."}
{"text":"Their buffalo chicken pizza is my teenager's favorite. Great food at a reasonable price. Their market is stocked with unique items I utilize in dishes I create."}
{"text":"Average pizza place.  Not the worst in the area, but far from the best.  I order takeout and delivery from here occasionally, mainly because it is close to my house.  The past time I was there the manager was eating food while taking people's orders and ringing them out.  That was very weird and unprofessional.  In terms of the food, I do enjoy their pizza.  The sauce and dough taste fresh, and the cheese stays on the pizza better than most places that have thinner crust.  I have also had the buffalo chicken hoagie and Italian hoagie.  Both tasted like something I could have made at home.  Will probably come back again because of the proximity, but I wish they would give their food quality and customer service a little more attention."}
{"text":"They have two things that are very good. The white pizza is very good and the gyros are some of the best in town. I like their gyros better than Tom's dinner. This is a family run business and not some big chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We kept seeing the sign for the cheese pizza sale. 8.99, take out only, decided to stop. Definitely a great choice. The pizza was the right crunch to the crush, the cheese was perfectly cooked, couldn't have asked for a better pizza."}
{"text":"Very nice gyro. Fries were a bit generic. They have delicious tira misu! The pizza is OK, not bad, but not fantastic. I'd get the gyros there (very meaty and fresh) and tira misu."}
{"text":"We always call this place the Euromart. I use to work in the GBU building and would meet the boyfriend for lunch here. They make a mean gyro. I've never had their pizza. That's just weird to me but I guess they expanded so that they could stay in business."}
{"text":"I don't know if people are aware, but this place serves a Serbian dish called Cevapi. I usually go there just for this dish. The bread is freshly baked and very soft and the meat is very good too."}
{"text":"I've only tried a hoagie and it was great.  I got a buffalo chicken hoagie and an italian hoagie.  The lettuce was a little wilted but other then that they were great.  I can't wait to try the pizza and maybe stop inside sometime.  Sounds like it would be interesting inside."}
{"text":"Note #1: There's a listing for an Aida Food Market at the same address. They are one and the same.  Note #2: There's not much room to sit as there's only 2-3 small tables inside, but we happened to stop in when they weren't very busy, so we got seated with no trouble. Check their website for delivery areas and more general info on this neato little business.  You got it bud! It's a pizzeria and grocer in one. In terms of groceries, they sell all sorts of Pan-European goods; meats, exotic beverages, foreign snack cakes, and myriad cured things in jars. I really didn't expect to find all of that inside this place I have rode by a zillion times. How many places do I say that about? The South Hills hold yet another dandy of a secret.  After looking around while waiting for our Friday night meal to be prepared, we came upon and almost bought a jar of this dessert spread called Eurocrem that looked really tasty...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocrem  BE VERY CAREFUL DOING AN INTERNET SEARCH ON EUROCREM AS YOU'LL FIND LINKS TO PORN! I AM SERIOUS. WATCH WHAT YOU CLICK ON IF YOU'RE NOT INTO THAT STUFF. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE SENDING ME EMAILS ABOUT THIS.   Ok? Whew!   Now we didn't buy any Euro groceries, BUT, we did get to try a doozy of a pizza pie here. The ladyfriend turned me on to the pineapple/bacon/black olive combo on pizza, so that's what we got, on a \"medium\" pie which is 8 cuts.   This crust is made by a virtuoso craftsperson. I mean that. I has to be. It was unlike any pizza I have ever eaten before.  Y'know how proper french fries, or \"chips\" as the Brits call 'em, are supposed to be crisp on the exterior and soft on the interior? That's EM's crust, and it works brilliantly. One could imagine a little old man in a village in the Old Country spinning the dough. The crust even looks ancient in a very cool way. Puffy, rustic, magnificent cheese, sweet pineapple, even sweeter bacon, black olives that actually possessed a little something called flavor, this was one terrific pizza.   My only complaint was that their sauce was just a little on the bland side and could have used more spices, in my opinion anyway.   Note #3: They also offer other dishes including gyros, spinach pie, soup, and something called Cevapi, which looks highly appetizing...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cevapi  And the head honcho there bears a close enough resemblance to Pittsburgh's own Joe Flaherty, a.k.a. \"Count Floyd\" from the old sketch show SCTV.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_2fQ5LC70  I forgive ya if ya don't remember.   But please do remember to come to E.M. Pizzeria."}
