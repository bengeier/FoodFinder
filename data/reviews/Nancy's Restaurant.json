{"text":"Nancy's is great.  The people are so friendly, and the atmosphere is very homey.  I plan to go there again and again.  Best grilled cheese ever, served on rye, yum!  GREAT French fries too and good iced tea.  The prices are really low, and you get plenty of food!  My friend had breakfast and loved it.   I just wish it was closer to where I live, that's about my only complaint."}
{"text":"If you're looking for diner food in an especially colloquial way, look no further than Nancy's Restaurant. The sign out front says \"Nancy's\" and the eponymous title is flanked by breakfast in front of clouds, like breakfast in the upper atmospheric climbs. I dare say this restaurant leans towards \"Diner\"; it has the feel that your day could start here.  On Saturdays they serve breakfast ALL DAY. The rest of the week b-fast stays in the AM and club sandwiches and something called \"Steak-um\"  gets served...  Though the food did not wow me, the comfort of interaction with our waitress and other diners did. Nancy's has a sense of community and as a stroll around Wilkinsburg offered further, there are few places in Wilkinsburg that seem to be so bustling.  For an extra treat stop in to the pawn shop next door- run by nice guys who just might cut you a post-breakfast deal."}
{"text":"Three star food. Five star old-lady waitresses and staff.  So Pittsburgh.  This is an old diner.  Coffee and breakfast all served on mismatched stoneware plates.  The prices are not old fashioned to match the very, very old cash register.  No credit cards, so bring cash.  My two eggs, three sausages and two hotcakes with coffee was $9.90.  I had to bump this up from a three star because I showed up before they opened, in a nasty bit of weather, and the ladies let me in and gave me coffee while they finished preparing for the day.  Gotta love the burgh and this a yinzer diner for certain.  Also, it is in Wilkinsburg and when I lived in Pittsburgh, we wouldn't ever venture into that part of town.  I am happy I did however because I got to witness how much Wilkinsburg has cleaned up and become an up and coming neighborhood.  Way to go!"}
