{"text":"This place is always closed!!!! Went there today and it is the fourth time they are closed!!!! First, in broken English \"we at San Gennaro come see us there\". Second, \"we at Foodie Fest see us there\"....third time it just said closed now it said \"Closed for a week on vacation\"!!!! Really...you don't have enough employees to keep 1 person at the store to man beef jerky and boba? The hours are really weird like 11-7 week days and I believe today Sunday 12-4????? Just weird...."}

{"text":"I've never been a beef jerky Fanatic until I came here.  Everything is tasty! Prices are great as well."}
{"text":"People in the store were sooo helpful and sampling was amazing. To me the
Chicken jerky was the BEST!!"}
{"text":"As I write this, my senses are awakened. I got the extra hot Thai style  jerky resonating in my mouth. My ears are popping and I just want more.

I came to this place out of convenience, because I had to pick up something from the nearby Amazon lockers. I walked in and I was greeted by a man excited to let me try any and all the samples that I wanted.

Every sample I had was great, but I had an allowance of $30 dollars to spend, so I got 3 large packages. I told the Jerky salesman what I wanted and he placed each item in a bag behind the counter. 

My only qualm is that I did not double check what he put in the bag. I asked for pineapple and he put in mango. I don't know if it was a translation error or if it was an accident, but I remember telling him that pineapple was better than mango.

Anyways, I like the mango enough to not go back and trade it in. There will be a next time, especially because I am unable to stop eating it and its only day one."}
