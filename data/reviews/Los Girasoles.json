{"text":"Was disappointed in their food. Being from San Diego I expect more from Mexican food.  Their ingredients are cheap.  Was not pleased with the customer service. No one was especially nice. The waiter seemed unamused and impatient."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you how the food is because they didn't acknowledge the reservation I made and insisted we wait with everyone else. Didn't want to wait and give them my business. Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"I was not extremely impressed. I felt that the food/drinks were more expensive than your typical mexican restaurant and I didn't feel that the quality was any better. Their chorizo queso was very good, but besides that it was just okay!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for the price and terrific service. Were visiting from Dallas-Fort Worth area and could not get over how good the food was. Simple, but well seasoned, this Ohio Mexican food was a step up from the Tex-Mex garbage that has taken over DFW suburbs. Beers were extremely reasonable and choice was decent for the family friendly place. our server was helpful and friendly. Unexpected highlight of the trip."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic food and fast service. The waiter was attentive and very nice. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Great margarita specials on Monday. Friendly staff and pretty good food. My friends and me have been going there for years for their Monday drinks special. They are very accommodating and the drinks get noticeably stronger after you tip we'll :)"}
{"text":"The Mexican food in this restaurant was so amazing we ate there twice on our week-long vacation. The food was delicious and very authentic Mexican Cuisine. The service was outstanding. I had the shrimp cocktail and it was out-of-this-world delicious. The margaritas wear wonderful especially the pitcher of fresh made margaritas. If I ever go back to Kent I will definitely eat at this restaurant. Their Seafood quesadilla was so delicious with mahi-mahi shrimp and scallops. I live in the west and have for many years and was surprised to find such authentic Mexican Cuisine in Kent Ohio."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food for a small town. Waitress was friendly and prompt. Food was great authentic Mexican. Homemade salsa and chips were awesome. Service was quick even though restaurant was busy. Will be back next time passing through town."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  Quality service and food.  Care is given to preparation.  They use fresh ingredients.  Love the shrimp tacos, husband loved the fish tacos.  Salsa made fresh, tasty with seasoning.  Highly recommend for an enjoyable Mexican meal.  Have seen people of all ages at restaurant."}
{"text":"i really like salsitas.  love their cheese dip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican Food in the area ..A+ By far the best Waitstaff in the area..A+ Always an enjoyable time!"}
{"text":"I've been pleased with everything I've tried here.  Service has always been great and food comes out quickly.  Their steak fajita nachos are delicious.  Portion sizes are large and the prices are very reasonable.  They also offer Kent State students a 10% discount if you show your ID at the register.    The casual atmosphere and good food makes it a winner."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite to eat before a concert. We told our waiter we were in a hurry and he really helped us out! Got our food out quick, checked on us, and gave us our bill quickly. The food was amazing! The salsa was so delicious. I would go back again and again! Really good place!"}
{"text":"Nice food with good price. There are not many cuisine options on I76 so this one wins on location as well."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican I've ever had. The service was terrible, aside from the presumable manager that greeted most tables. Our server, hostess, etc. left much to be desired. Processed cheese-type sauce on everything or in everything we ordered. It was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"great food, great service, great fun.  Relax a little and service is even better.  Listen if you are thinking fine dininng...get over it.  Great food great service great price."}
{"text":"The new name is Los Girasoles. Service was good, as was the food. Prices are readonable....what's not to like. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite sit-down Mexican restaurant in the area. Waiters are friendly and attentive. Service is fast. Food is delicious. They make a good margarita as well!"}
{"text":"Slow-ish service when I visited, but the margs are good, food is decent.  I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Salsita's is my go-to sit down Mexican restaurant in Kent. I've never had a problem getting a table, the service is always fast and friendly, and the food and margaritas are solid. We usually can split a meal here because of the hefty portions (which stretch even further for local students - bring in your student ID and get 10% off). Our favorites are the steak fajitas and the steak fajita nachos (we may have a theme going). They don't have as many flavored margarita options as Guacamoles, but I'm partial to lime anyway, and I think they taste better overall at Salsita's. Be sure to check out their specials - just like a lot of Mexican places, they have great drink deals that change daily."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for the margaritas and fun atmosphere. The quantity and price are nice, but the taste is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Had micheladas (great job) tacos de carnitas omg that was great... salsa chips were very fresh and tasty.... if ur around the area, stop by...no disappointments... delicious food and friendly, quick service"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We absolutely love the Mexican pizza and the Margaritas.   One of the things we love besides the food is Carlos, an employee there. He is always so friendly and such a hard worker. We enjoy seeing him and his sunny disposition.   Our go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Really good typical Mexican food. Was so full at the end of my meal I could barely walk to the car"}
{"text":"This location on the edge of Kent is a typical format Mexican restaurant. Chile Colorado, hot and spicy Burrito, combos 1-20..... It is not great. Pretty bland. They open a lot of cans here. Taco Tontos is just a few miles down the road in downtown Kent. A much better alternative."}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican restaurant!  The salsa felt really authentic and had a nice smoky flavor.  The gold margaritas were excellent!  Cheese dip was tasty.  Excellent service, we were well taken care of.  Friendly atmosphere and comfy booths  Will definitely come again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Not greasy or soggy. Clean. Great service."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Ordered the beef taco and enchilada. Taco had fresh washed lettuce which made it somewhat runny. Come on folks, drain the lettuce. Enchilada has a nice corn tortilla, mild beef, and mild sauce. My biggest criticism is that there was not much flavor. There was cheese (cheese product?) on it which added nothing to either item. Beef was lightly seasoned and tasty but not much kick to anything. Refried beans were ok with the same criticism. 3 stars because of the service, not the food."}
{"text":"The food was great! The salsa was the best I've had at a Mexican restaurant. Margaritas were pretty good.   The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place was all around awful. Slow, poor service. Appetizer came with the meal. Steak was burnt. Not even any lettuce on the tacos. Would absolutely NOT recommend or ever come back."}
{"text":"Love this place - I have been going there for years and never even have to get a -menu or order - the staff knows what I want. Even when there has been an issue, it always gets resolved quickly.   My wife loves the #21 and I am a sucker for the grilled chicken quesadillas!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had the Special 76, you haven't lived. Simply sensational, and who thought of putting pineapple on a burrito. Good service, good food, time for a nap!"}
{"text":"We we're a group of 18 mostly high school kids staying at the holiday inn express next door. The waiter was great- all separate checks, all orders correct, fast, friendly. Quick good food. Much better than I expected. I had the special for $10 and it came on two plates. Very inexpensive. The chips were very good."}
{"text":"We had a large group eat here two nights in a row, and both nights we were very pleased with both the food and the service. I had the shredded beef enchiladas and a variety of dishes were ordered by our party. No one had a negative thing to say about any of the dishes.  When you arrive, you are given chips and salsa, and we ordered queso and guacamole, both excellent. The prices were extremely reasonable, and the 5 pitchers of margaritas were just awesome. We will be back next year!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and the drinks are fabulous!  Service is great as well.  Friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"This was my first visit since the establishment changed names.  My family and I had an enjoyable dinner on the weeknight we visited.  The staff were friendly, attentive, prompt, and seemed to enjoy their job.  The colorful dinning area, festive decorations, and energetic music make for enjoyable, uplifting, and relaxing atmosphere.  I ordered the taco pizza and loved it.  When the waitress delivered my pizza I was amazed at it's large size and generous portions of toppings. Unless you have a large appetite the pizza is definitely one you should probably share with someone or take half home for lunch the next day.  The pizza was so good I had to eat later that night the portion I brought home."}
{"text":"Incredibly helpful staff, solid food, reasonable prices. The Brimfield Special is the best!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places EVER! We found this place & will drive past a slew of other Mexican restaurants to go here. Awesome food, great margaritas, great queso!!! Everyone we've recommended it to has loved it! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"The name is now Los Girasoles. Food wasn't good; 2 of the 3 male employees we came in contact with had bad attitudes, it seemed it \"pained\" them to be pleasant; asked for 2 small plates with our appetizer; plates never came. We won't be back. If you want good Mexican food, go to Pancho's in Alliance."}
{"text":"I've been here three times when visiting family ... But this time warranted a review.  The service here is always speedy and efficient!  Plus they bring out your food in one arm ... Pretty cool.  The chips and salsa were extra delicious.  Salsas tend to be bland or on the mild side at Mexican restaurants ... But the chips were fresh, crispy and well seasoned.... The salsa was amazing with a nice kick that slows ones appetite to enjoy the freshly crafted ingredients.  I ordered the 43 special and it was AMAZING!  I won't order another dish since I was blown away.  Sizzling ribeye and jumbo shrimp with their special cheese sauce was the best Mexican restaurant dish I've ever had.  Hands down.  I've lived in Dallas Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Reno NV, Chicago and this place tops all.  What a find.  Thanks again for making this meal epic!  If give more stores if there was an option.  Service, atmosphere, and FOOD makes this place rock!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area. The route 43 special is my girlfriend's favorite, and I'm always down for the chimichangas. The margaritas need work (though that doesn't stop me from downing a pitcher, of course haha) and the salsa is too runny for my taste, but the price is good and the service is super quick. A definite stop."}
{"text":"This is very similar to other American-Mexican restaurants. They have basic enchiladas, fajitas and burritos. The thing that makes this place different is that the service is very good and all of the people there are very nice. The bar is very nice and cozy and it is fun to go there. The prices are pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. The salsa is made fresh so it's a little different flavor each time but very good. The service is good as well. The get your food out to you quickly but never rush you to leave. When I am in town this is my go to spot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I agree, similar to other American-Mexican restaurants.  A few things that make them a little different:  The Carne Asada comes out on a sizzling skillet with grilled onions (definitely not diet food), very tasty, and the golden margaritas are simply the best I have ever had, which is why I rate 4 stars. They now have a patio, and for cold winter days, the bar is cozy.  Restaurant decor could be a little more authentic, and salsa  is definitely not the best I have had, however, overlooking these minor imperfections,  prices are extremely reasonable, and the staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great service! Some of the meals are on the salty side, but, most are pretty good! Love being able to sit outside when it's warm. The bathrooms are mediocre, but hey, it's a bathroom lol. We Go a lot, it's a quick, fast, and good dinner :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, food was great. We had fajitas and it came out very quickly! I had the queso and it was exceptional. My only complaint was the hostess she was just so rude when i called ahead to ask if their chips were gluten free and even when we got there she was rolling her eyes at customers and it kind of ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been there twice when staying in town for work and both times the food was solid.  Actually the salsa is amazing, nice and chunky which is very different from most restaurants and I eat a ton of Mexican.   Margaritas were solid, I had the KSU special for a slightly healthier option, I mean it had fresh tomatoes and avocados, but naturally had shredded cheese and all the goodness on top of steak and chorizo.  So I guess it's healthier than some options but maybe not \"healthy\".    Good drink specials and the bar tender, where I set up ano at the bar, took great care of me.  I will be back and will try something new again I'm a few weeks."}
{"text":"Traveling to Akron from Youngstown and stopped in for lunch. Excellent service, good prices and huge portions. I had the commorones ala diabla and soup. The bowl of soup could have fed three people and was full of shredded chicken and rice and vegetables, very tasty. The lunch plate had 15 shrimp on it with rice and beans and a killer hot sauce (like an enchilada sauce) very nice. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh! Huge portions...great for sharing. Excellent friendly service and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Holiday Inn next to resturant wow i must say food was excellent. Good prices and also great service. I definitely wpild recommend for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Little leary when we got of the highway and it was right there, but only place to eat next to the hotel. In town visiting Kent State. Parking lot was packed!  Menu was a surprise, lots of local themed specials, which was really cool to see.  Salsa was great & chips were hot. I ordered the Salsitas enchiladas, my son got the deep fried burrito. Both were fresh and delicious. Wish this was a local place to me, cuz I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here. The service and staff were fast and friendly; the food got to the table quick, with great chips and salsa to hold us over for the main course. The food was filling and good. I like the decor as well, with a sunflower motif as the restaurant's name means sunflowers! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am here about once a week. Some days of service are better then others. There is one waiter there who is a huge dick and doesnt even look at you when your ordering.. Then gets your order wrong! But besides that love it! Yummayyyy"}
{"text":"Pretty average American-Mexican dining, nothing really authentic here. If you are staying at the HI express, walk on over and enjoy a cold, tall Dos Equis Amber on tap and the chips and salsa! All in all a solid dining experience, nice bar and friendly staff. Had the enchiladas, pretty average but would visit again."}
{"text":"This place, in atmosphere, is exactly what you'd expect. Mexican-themed decorations, free chips and salsa, good margaritas and friendly staff.  My family really likes it because the 76 Special and 43 Special are really good and the prices are cheap enough that a family of four can eat there without really breaking the break. Try the white sangria if you want the room to spin!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to the area in December, and have eaten here more times than we can count. The food and service have been amazing every single time. The only downside is the margaritas are too affordable for your own good! Lol. Chips and salsa are authentic, as are all the foods. My wife is from Texas and we have spent over a month traveling throughout Mexico, and this food is nearly as authentic as being down there. We'll continue to go back for our regular date nights, every time we want consistent, reasonably priced, great food!"}
{"text":"Good salsa. Everybody likes to say salsa. Below avg guac. Nice waitress and service. Shrimp fajitas a bit of a letdown. The shrimp seemed cheap and lacked any seasoning...would prolly not go back and if i did, I'd avoid the shrimp."}
{"text":"I have been going here with my group of 3 -6 friends, once or more a month, for the last year and sadly the service has fallen to the point where we can no longer eat there.   In our last 2 or 3 experiences we ordered items and did not receive them, were charged for items we did not get, did not get the correct order at all, could not get a refill, and/or got someone else's order from the restaurant.  This last time we visited they gave us 50% because of the service but no discount makes up for lack of quality service; and yes we let them know every time they made a mistake.   I give them 2 stars because the food is delicious when you do get it right and the price is great. I would love to be able to continue going here but whatever lack of system the servers use and the runners use cause it to be a very awkward and frustrating experience for those involved.   We may try to go back in a month or two but until then we will be looking at other places to have our traditional Sunday night out Mexican dinner."}
{"text":"Salsitas is a great place to get tasty mexican food at a reasonable price.  Their salsa is super tasty, and they even give you chips and salsa for takeout :D  I love it!"}
