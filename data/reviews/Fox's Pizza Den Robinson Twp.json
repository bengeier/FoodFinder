{"text":"So upset when i went to foxs a few days ago. I had hair in my food. as soon as i opened my pizza box up there it was standing straight up like a birthday candle. wings soggy. The only good thing was the chesse bread. Probably wont go back for awhile. Those two girls working should be wearing hair nets."}
{"text":"Nice friendly and fast!!!  Good value for the pizza.  Actually liked the pizza, but the mushrooms were a little like canned mushrooms and the italian sausage a little too crumbly and dried out.  But the price was good.  Reminded me of costco pizza..."}
{"text":"Mehhh... I ordered an Italian hoagie and a create your own Stromboli.  The hoagie was good but the Stromboli was horrible, it tasted old, burnt, bland, over seasoned with garlic powder. The portion is huge but who cares about portion sizes if you can't eat it. I was hesitant to order from here and I won't order again unless it's for just a hoagie.  Prices are reasonable though"}
{"text":"Good stuff, it's not a 5 diamond ultra re?turant√®, it doesn't need to be, it's a pizza place and it does it's job well. Kudos and such"}
{"text":"I stopped at Fox's because the Greek place I was looking for was closed. 'M glad they were, because Fox's the pizza and salad were awesome!  The staff was welcoming and friendly."}
