{"text":"Been going for years. One of my favorite places to get a good burger at reasonable price... Hot dogs are overstuffed with toppings... Just a good little local spot..."}
{"text":"Tucked into the back corner of the Valero Service Station is the Doby Bridge Cafe.  No fancy advertizing, they rely on word-of-mouth and advertizing in local events that they sponsor, such as the Ft.. Mill Community Playhouse, a local amateur theater.  A favorite of locals, mostly trades guys who need a grab and go place to get good food at reasonable prices...fast.  Their burgers are the best in the area and they have specials every day and week.  Their loaded hot dogs are a true meal in itself.  You order your food and take it to the convenience store cashier to pay for it and any extras you get, like sodas and chips, off the shelves.  Tables are scattered throughout the store with a small eating area in the back.  Nothing fancy, but the food is excellent.  Local at it's best."}
{"text":"This is a grill inside a convienence store first off.  This is a good ole' standard dive grill - burgers dogs, chicken sandwich, corndog, etc.  That being said, this place has a very good breakfast and lunch.  I stop in here often for BLT on toast and my daughter loves the grits - not instant.  I would have to say I prefer this place to places like Waffle House, Huddle House, etc.    Been here a few times for lunch and you can request Nathan's hot dogs if you prefer over the red weenies.  Everything is made to order so not sitting under a hot lamp getting tough.   Extremely friendly staff and one of my favorite quick spots to hit."}
