{"text":"I had the cashew chicken. I could do better in my own kitchen and I am not a chef. The chicken tasted old   On the plus side the portions were large and reasonably priced but who wants a lot of old chicken?"}
{"text":"not the best place at talking stick resort. Often its hard to get the bartenders attention. however, good place to get a quick drink."}
{"text":"I went to the Blue Coyote Grill & Bar last night. It was the worst experience ever. I went there with 3 of my friends and it took 45 minutes to get our food. There was nobody in the place just myself and my friends and when the food finally showed up to our table, three of the plates of food were cold. They even messed up 2 of the orders: we had asked for eggs over medium but ended up somehow with scrambled eggs instead. The portions themselves were very small at $10 a plate, while their menu suggested a hearty size meal. I honestly get better service and portions at Denny's then at this place. I would not recommend Blue Coyote Grill & Bar to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST service. After a meal that should have been simple for a group of us it took an hour and a half to get food and FORTY minutes to split our meal. After all of that they added a forced gratuity because of the size of our group. Don't go here. The food and price isn't worth sitting through this service."}
{"text":"Took them 25 minutes to bring us our lunch, and they were not busy.  The broccoli beef rice was undercooked, and a piece of gristle was found in the beef.  Also no detectable muzak, making it a hushed, awkward atmosphere."}
{"text":"We go here often the food is always fresh and hot also they will accommodate any special requests. Breakfast all day and night! The sushi is what i always get and is extremely fresh. They do have a sushi happy hour menu from 3-7pm...prices are about half the price. Service has always been great from the hostesses and servers. We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for the value, especially because it was happy hour. But the bartender, Bruce, is the one who informed us about the happy hour deal, and since it was 4 minutes before the end, encouraged us to make a quick decision. Good job there!! Food good, service good. No complain."}
{"text":"I would rank the Blue Coyote Cafe as OK.  The prices are my main concern -- casino restaurants should have lower prices on both drinks and on food. $6 a beer? Come on guys... I know this isn't the cafe's fault, but its ridiculous.   Ok, I know that's off course... so here's the skinny.  The Food is OK. I would consider it about a 5 or 6 out of 10.  Isn't bad, but it's just not great either. I can tell the grilled chicken was frozen, for example and not fresh.  My won ton soup was OK, probably the best part of the meal (unfortunately).... wished pricing was better, I spent about $35 just on my two courses and a few drinks and walked away with something left to be desired.   Menu was very skinny - not a lot of options here, and the selections did not appeal to me.   Our server was professional, courteous and friendly.  No problems there.  He did however (forget!) about my second drink ; and I had to remind him.  So, overall 3 stars ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for a mid afternoon lunch. Had a very good burger and nacho plate. Service was very slow and laid-back. No sense of urgency here. Food quality was good, cutlery and presentation was great. Sat outside on a nice patio with nearby plugs to charge phones.  Should have gone for the sushi!  Nice portion sizes.  Potato wedges with burger were delicious"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for my sister's bachelorette party. The prices were great, food was tasty, the service was excellent, and they even treated us to some complimentary desserts! We came here for breakfast the next morning with a smaller group and really enjoyed it as well.   I would recommend coming to Talking Stick for a small get-together with friends, and coming to Blue Coyote Cafe is a good idea for those not wanting to spend too much money yet still have a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast...probably the easiest meal to make, right?  Well,  not at the Blue Coyote Cafe at Talking Stick.  Friend and I both ordered their breakfast, eggs any way, hash browns, two sausage patties, and toast.  I ordered eggs over easy; friend ordered scrambled. Both were under cooked, yet we waited 45 minutes...wha?  Sausage patties were wet, which to me means the were frozen and not cooked long enough to cook off the water.  I always ask for my hash browns to be crispy.  This was either not communicated or the cook doesn't know what that means. They were browned on one side, but only one side. The toast...we both ordered english muffins. I didn't know they could be that thin!  It wasn't that busy at the time, so there's no excuse for such a shabby meal.  Also, Talking Stick, get over yourself.  $8 for this slop?  Really? Then it should have been excellent.  Put your money in the slots; eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and their menu is confusing, it has breakfast and Chinese food mixed together. None of the food my party ordered was very good. The iced tea tasted old and the chicken was dry. The only thing good is that it's convenient for hotel guests"}
{"text":"Was here on Christmas Eve hoping to play some cards and have a bite to eat.  Ordered a bloody mary with no ice and lots of spice.  Oops.  Came full of ice and not spicy enough. Ordered the half pound cheeseburger with fries.  It was good.  The crux of the matter was the Dragon Chicken which was ordered spicy with fried rice.   Hubby tasted the chicken meat and besides it being overdone, he said it tasted like it has spent too much time in the refrigerator.  I tasted it and agreed.  He also asked me to taste the fried rice and I agreed that it was the worst \"fried\" rice I ever tasted.  What happened? We've had Asian food before here and it was good.  Knowing that we had nothing at home to eat, he ate some of it under protest.  I had to hear all the way home, what a bad dinner he had.    He filled out a survey about the food/service and gave it to the woman at the hostess station as you enter.  We asked that it be given to the manager.  She said she would.  Hope the information we provided will help  improve the quality of the food (that fried rice needs help!!!!!)"}
{"text":"I stayed at Talking Stick recently for a little \"stay-cation\" and I was really impressed with my experience. I spent some time at the pool and then had breakfast the next morning at the Blue Coyote Cafe and the staff was amazing. The service was super fast but still friendly and my food was delicious. The manager was out walking around and stopped to ask how I was doing. It was a great touch and felt very personal. The service at the pool was great too- I had a couple drinks out there and didn't have any issues finding a server. They also keep the pool area really clean even with the pool parties and that can't be an easy task. Overall it was a great experience and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our stay.  Once for lunch and then again the next day for breakfast.  I had the Club Salad with a side of onion rings.  I little good w/a side of something bad.  LOL!  The salad was huge and full of turkey, avocado, cheese, bacon.  The veggies were fresh and the ranch dressing was rich and creamy.  The onion rings were good.  The onions had a lot of moisture in them, so they got soggy pretty quick.  Hubby had the Dragon Chicken w/fried rice and mini egg roll appetizer.  The chicken was crispy and had a great sweet and spicy flavor.  The egg rolls were really good.  The next morning I had the Two Egg breakfast w/sausage and hubby had the Country Fried Steak.  Everything was good, pretty standard breakfasts.  Nothing stood out, but nothing was terrible either.  The waitstaff at both meals were awesome.    This place has a lot of variety and quality food."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place gets a 2 star is for the service.  The food was CRAP.  Overpriced and bland.  I'm not usually a fan of Casinos however this was the only option that was not a buffett or $$$$ expensive restaurant, so for a quick bit, this was it.  The scenery outside was of the back of a pool and a concrete wall, which didn't help the situation.  Oh, and you can smoke, since it's a casino I expected this but doesn't make it a preferable experience."}
{"text":"Love the Fajita Nachos! Great combination of vegetables, chicken and cheese. The guacamole and salsa is yummy too!!"}
{"text":"The two stars is because my hummus plate was really tasty. Some colleagues and I stopped in here for a snack before leaving for the airport, and I was astonished by how rude and completely overwhelmed our server seemed to be by a party of 10. Every request was met with a sigh and a look that made it seem like we were asking for the impossible. I'm amazed that we were treated so poorly..."}
{"text":"I sat outside by a firepit and listened to some excellent guitar music while munching on chips and salsa. The service by Camilla was excellent as we enjoyed the Arizona evening. The maintenance people came out at dusk and turned on the fire pits so we could enjoy the warmth of the fire on the comfy padded chairs. A perfect evening to relax.  The beer choices are average and my friend enjoyed a large white sangria that had a lot of fresh fruit in it. I'd recommend this place for the ambiance especially."}
{"text":"Food was pretty bad. Meat was dry and tough. Tasted like it's been sitting in the cooler frozen for a while. May be edible if you were wasted drunk.. maybe. Don't go here if you able to drive sober somewhere else nearby."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for while I was in town for business. Great atmosphere and the staff was friendly and helpful. I had a ribeye and my wife and the beef and broccoli. Wanted sushi but my wife is pregnant and, well...Food was great. Hope we can make it back when it's not for business."}
{"text":"The Holiday special was quite the deal at Blue Coyote. The Thanksgiving buffet had a line a mile long, but downstairs I got a high top table in the sushi bar and dinner was on its way about 20 minutes later. The all white turkey was real of course and it was a good portion, but that wasn't the end. The whipped potatoes, the walnut, apple stuffing and the garlicky green beans were spot on great. They also gave you a cream of potato soup (or salad) and a pumpkin torte for desert, which was homemade. The total was only $18.95. I might return for XMas if they have this deal again."}
{"text":"Best happy hour sushi and drink deals! My daughter and I went for her 21st birthday and we were very pleased with our food and server, thanks Denny :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to eat here while staying at Talking Stick. We waited a few minutes to get the the hostess, who told us they had high top dining available. Neither of us like high top dining so we asked if anything else was available, even if we had to wait. The hostess said she would check, and though she didn't actually roll her eyes, she might as well have, as her body language said she was annoyed she had the leave her little station. We were eventually seated outside. It was a little chilly and quite windy, but we took the table because we were hungry. This is when we get to meet the WORST waiter I have ever had. He did not introduce himself, did not smile, did not start with any pleasantries, ask if we wanted appetizers, nothing. He DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT US!  He just asked what we wanted.  We ordered, he disappeared, and we did not see him again until the food arrived, about 25 minutes later. My burger was very over cooked, and my girlfriend received a giant bowl of noodles which she had to pick through to find any vegetables or meat.  We finished eating and had to wait an additional 15 minutes until the waiter appeared again to give us the bill. We were supposed to receive 10% off because of our players club card, but didn't. And frankly after spending more time waiting than being waited on, we did not stick around to argue. We expected a lot more from a casino restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here after a night of drinking at the club. We were all hungry and wanted something to eat. Everyone was telling us to come here because they have some pretty good food especially the fried rice. And boy were they right. You get a huge bowl of fried rice which you can share with others or take home for leftovers. I didn't really try anything else on the menu, will definitely have to come back. They also give you water with cucumber which I wasn't a big fan of it. Id rather have lemon. I also heard about the sushi and how good it is here. But it was closed by the time we got here. So I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service here isn't necessarily the fastest around, but the food is normally pretty good and given the location & convenience relative to the casino and resort, it's a good choice. Their Asian food is usually the best option on the menu. I have them bring me a side of their chili sauce and spice it up a bit, but it's good without the spice too."}
{"text":"Very noisy to say the least.  Guests talking is carried throughout the small space and the waiting cleaning up dishes was the worst. We each had a club salad. Presentation was nice.   The food was fine except the cheap deli turkey rolls. Not a good vales at $12.50. They were generous with the avocados.  The seeded roles were fine.  Not much was open at Christmas."}
{"text":"Tasteless, bad food. For a casino food, I expected more, also, I found a piece of bone in my chicken sandwich, also the fries no flavor, food intended to be without flavor? Bad customer service, mediocre food, and no quality control on the food. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Super fun night.  Before a show upstairs in the showroom, a couple of friends and I enjoyed dinner at the Blue Coyote Cafe.  What a place! The decor is very modern and it does not detract from the food or the company.  It is a little bit of a noisy place, but it adds to the excitement of the evening.  Two of us had the Chicken Caesar Salad and I must say I was very happy with the salad. Not too much dressing, perfectly cooked chicken, fresh and crisp lettuce.  One of the best I've had.    The other one of us had steak and eggs.  She was very happy with her meal, as well.  I also had a Mojito.  It was heavy on the alcohol (which I love), unlike most bars that water down the first drink to see if you will drink more.  It was terrific.  Very balanced and full of flavor.  I would most definitely got back."}
{"text":"Food was good, hard to have a conversation with my party because of the thumping bass from the constant pool party just beyond the glass patio doors.  Unfortunately, the thumping music was not synced to the restaurant muzak. Waited for the check to be picked up by our server, before finally going to the hostess station to pay and sought refuge in the casino, where the slot machine noise (thankfully) drowned out the thumping bass."}
{"text":"Food was good, service even better. Our waiter checked in multiple times including the manager made his rounds. Quality of the food was very good would highly recommend, and I will come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"OK. I get it. With the diverse clientele that visit the casino, you want to offer a diverse menu. The challenge with trying to be good at everything you end up being good at nothing. I had the ribeye steak. The steak needed seasoning & was finally cooked right on the second go round. Sure, mistake are made but for the price, I expected a better cut of meat, the flavor & texture to be spot on and my guest to have a really good dinning experience.  It was just OK for us. My wife said we do not have to go back. Happy wife = Happy Life!"}
{"text":"Blue Coyotes has never failed to impress me, especially with the causal and quick concept behind the cafe. The service is always quite responsive and knowledgeable about the menu.   Generally when I go, I always make it a priority to order off of the sushi menu. Because my mom generally gets large dollar amount comps to the restaurant, we have a bit of money to blow so sushi is always a good choice. If you don't have restaurant comps, it is not cheap but not expensive sushi. Otherwise, everything else on their menu is very competitively priced.   From their sushi menu, I have tried their salmon sashimi (which is generally pretty good- not the greatest I've had though), surf and turf roll (interesting but good), shrimp tempura roll (good), and then many others. Their sushi is always a solid choice, and usually never disappoints.   Other than the sushi, I've gotten their mac and cheese which is really good, their noodle bowl (perhaps my favorite thing on the menu), the club sandwich (amazing), and some of their desserts. My favorite dessert of theirs is the brownie with ice cream on top which is really good.   There are some photos I have posted of some of the meals I have had."}
{"text":"Foods good, service isn't the fastest at the bar.  Waited 10 mins before he got around to me, I wasn't in a rush but still. The snotty Scottsdale women blabbing didn't help make me any happier, but that's not the Blue Coyotes fault, that's just in the genes of any over 40 divorced woman to talk incessantly about how bitter they are."}
{"text":"It was okay.  We had wonton soup, happy family, and the duck potstickers.  Fran was very nice and patient with us."}
{"text":"Three stars since previous experience was good - but one star down for an issue today.  Food is ok - about what you expect.  I ordered the Happy Family asian lunch.  It was ok - smallish portion and flavor was ok - somewhat muddy.  The \"Spring Rolls\" are 5 bullet sized (and strength) morsels that are not what I expected.  Over cooked and really not much more than one or two bites.  For the 5 bucks - I'll pass.  The bigger problem was my dining companions meal.  The Thai salad ordered looked great - he ordered the chicken addition.  All well - presentation is great.  But that's the problem.  The bowl used is one of these fancy-pancy ones where the front is much lower than the back with a small 'foot print' on a small square plate.  The salad is loaded \"back heavy\".  You use your knife/fork to cut the chicken - and it all flips forward - filling your lap/shirt/table/seat/floor with dressed salad and chicken.  Brought the issue to the servers attention - no offer to replace/reduce($) the salad... and I wonder if management will hear/do anything with the information that the bowl selection for the salad is not good.  Thumbs up for keeping the soda filled ... and for the dealer busing on Black Jack!  But the meal today...  Fail."}
{"text":"Pretty upscale 24 hour cafe with great service.  My bf and I were hungry at 3am, looked on yelp for late night cafe's and our options were either Denny's, Mexican joints, or fast food.  Since we haven't checked out the newly renovated Casino Arizona, we decided to take a trip out there and eat at Blue Coyote.  When I asked security how to get to Blue Coyote, he was kind enough to walk us through the casino and down a flight of stairs to the cafe.  The cafe is exceptionally clean and pretty with colors of purples, whites, and neutral colors.    Sandwiches and Burgers (come with potato wedges) are $9.25-$9.75.  Dinner entrees are $17-$23 and breakfast items were under $12.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Balsamic Vinaigrette on Ciabatta sandwich and my BF ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger on kaiser roll.  The potato wedges were crisp and seasoned extremely well.  My sandwich  was perfectly cooked, the chicken was moist and juicy, however it could use a bit more seasoning.  My BF enjoyed his burger, but loved his potato wedges way more.    Service was on point, I never had an empty glass of water nor did I have to ask for refills."}
{"text":"Best drinks and salads! Love this place, they remodeled since we were last here looks amazing! Very clean, open 24 hours, food is excellent, how can you go wrong. Manager comes in and asks how things are, and the waitress was sharpe and on the ball. No issues, just great over all service."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to stop by the casino after work. So we had dinner at the Blue Coyote Cafe, since it was Saturday. The Casino and Cafe were very busy. So we were seated outside, it was a very cool evening. But the portable heaters did their job. Now only if the waitress did hers. Since we were outside we felt like we were forgotten. We shared a bacon cheese burger with fries and added fruit. Burger was excellent, filled us both up. When we were outside, the manager came by a few times to check on us, and the helpers made sure we had plenty of water. But we had to wait for ever for our food, to ask for our check, and even to get our check. Then we had to wait for our sign receipt. Food, prices if it's not a steak are good. Service still needs help! Would I try this place again? If it's food, I'll try anything twice!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am impressed that they have such variety but do not lack on quality one ounce. No, I wasn't expecting typical shoddy casino food when I chose to eat here. You are in Scottsdale, after all.   ~Fud/Drink~ I chose to eat some sushi....at a cafe..... I KNOW, RIGHT!?! I paired it along with a sake and beer. I did not bomb the sake haha, enjoyed them both separately. I was impressed with the quality once again. Both the sushi and sake were surprisingly good and tasty given where we were at. I was very impressed with the sushi and sake combo. The waitress knew the differences between the different listed sake's, how awesome is that?! Just on the sheer fact that sushi at a cafe was superb speaks volumes of this place. I picked at my sister's and fiance's plates, both their dishes were great as well. I forget what they got, but I did enjoy them, I at least remember that.   ~Extras/Rating~ This is the best dining option at Talking Stick in my eyes. They have a wide variety of options, it  seems as though the waitstaff care about you and have some answers, and I do not feel as though I wasted my money. It is a bit out of my normal price range, but next time I come to Talking Stick, I will definitely eat only here! They get 4 stars for service, quality and variety of food, and for being a surprisingly good option based off of initial face value."}
{"text":"Service was crappy. Wine was horrible. Food was eh. This is the kind of place you come with your little kids."}
{"text":"Blue Coyote is inside of Talking Stick Resort. HH Monday through Friday 4 to 7 for selected sushi rolls and alcoholic cocktails.  Get the unagi and advacado roll! So delish. :)"}
{"text":"Not a fan of slow service and decent food.  I think the Blue Coyote refers to my mood and my belly hollowing and being hungry.  They ran out of a product and they had to switch it up which is not a big deal.  They made it work and that's what I appreciate.  We ordered the Drums of Heaven which I heard was really good.  They didn't have the right Chicken but substituted with another.  I thought it was pretty good since the brown sauce is usually really salty, but this one wasn't.   My sister and I each ordered a burger.  Mines was well done, real.... well.  It was somewhat dry in the middle plus I didn't care too much for the condiments.  I actually had to add ketchup, which I generally don't when ordering a hamburgers.  I would say the fries were my favorite.  Steak potato fries are yummy, but my I'm sure my love handles are screaming at me!  The ambience was pretty strange.  It had that truck stop cafe feel with some modern pop.  The Sushi bar really made a difference to the feel, but it was really awkwardly placed.  I didn't think it really belonged and it should just branch out on it's own to attract more customers.  Blue Coyote Cafe doesn't really scream sushi to me.    The service like I said was slow, but I don't think I can blame our waitress.  She did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was really polite.  I think there was confusion on who was supposed to serve us in the beginning and with the missing ingredient; really slowed the serving of the food.  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 22 and they were very accommodating. They say us in 5 minutes and that's awesome! They had to work it out because the sushi bar was closing in less than 30 minutes.  I am somewhat of a sushi expert and I say their sushi was great. From the Dynamite to the Surf and Turf to the Rainbow Roll. It was delicious. And the nigiri pieces were pretty big too. I would definitely come for the sushi and the prices were not bad. Even cheaper than some rolls at other places that weren't so high class.  However, I was disappointed with the fillet mignon. It felt tender but it was a little overcooked. It was more medium than medium rare. It had a dryness to it. And whatever seasoning they had on it, it didn't come out that much. Yeah....  Also tried the salmon and chicken. Decent as well. Well, if you are in the Talking Stick Resort gambling your money away, you might as well spend some of your earnings at this place. Food is decent. Sushi is great. Eat here... then go back to winning some more money. :)"}
{"text":"fantastic place! food is INCRRRRRREDIBLE!!! and the prices are just right!! and our waitress was so sweet and so attentive, just a great place to go and eat and maybe gamble a little in the casino :-)"}
{"text":"Driving down the 101 loop searching for a place to grab a meal we see Talking Stick Casino we talk about it and decide most of the time these places have good food so we pull in park and head for the casino, wow this place is nice with multiple restaurants, we decide on Blue Coyote as it seems like an upscale coffee shop.  head over to the hostess who ignores us for the young \"good-looking guys\" behind us so we wait for her to come back and take us to our table, probably where we should have bolted but gave it a chance, nice place tastefully decorated  menu is very  limited we make our selections wait for our server who arrives to take our order. I select the combo burger as recommended by server done medium with side of \"best fries you will ever eat\" I also opted for the tomato soup that turned out to be very small but the best part of our meal, my wife ordered the shrimp and chicken with asparagus and white rice. food arrives my wife lets server know before she even leaves the table that there is a hair in her food on one of the shrimps we all see it and server takes it back to kitchen to have another one made, and then returns a few minutes later to inform us that the chef said it was perfectly fine it was just a strand from the asparagus and he was not making another one, nice that he made that choice for us needless to say it did not get eaten and the manager we asked for never did show up. this is not the way you run a restaurant and I am assuming it was a line cook and not a chef because in most cases a chef cares about what he puts out of his kitchen this one did not. Next my medium burger that arrived burnt to a crisp and tasted  a little like charcoal with dried up cold potato wedges another return to another chefs remark of did this guy never have a medium burger its done perfect. wrapping this up if a no star option was available its where I would have gone and they need to clean up their act because this place presents well it just does not deliver."}
{"text":"Was at Talking Stick Casino and Resort and had some time to waste so I headed on over the Blue Coyote Café to catch some Happy Hour deals.  Was greeted right away and showed to my table, I also was asked if I would like to sit outside or inside, I preferred inside. Service was great and friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.  So after checking out the H H menu I went ahead and ordered an glass of sparkling wine, edamane, spicy salmon & spicy tuna rolls.  Now I don't want to brag, but everything together was under 15 bucks! Hello!!! That's a great deal!   The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were fresh and delish! The edamane perfectly steamed and salted.  It was just what I was craving and it didn't damage the pocket book.   Maybe next time I'll gather some friends and HH with them."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Talking Stick Resort on August 31, 2016 for the first time. We decided to try this restaurant as we were getting hungry after walking around checking everything out in the casino. I won some money, so this made it even sweeter.  We chose the Blue Coyote Cafe. We were greeted and seated immediately after we looked over the menu.  Our hostess asked us for our drink order and she returned quickly with the ice tea and water. She brought lemons as well because my husband indicated he wanted lemon for his water. After we looked over the menu, our waiter came and introduced himself. He took our order of Broccoli and Beef with white, steamed rice and Happy Family with fried rice.  It wasn't that long of a wait and he brought our meals out to us. My husband ordered the dinner size for his meal: Happy Family and I ordered the lunch size for the Beef and Broccoli. The meals were delicious. The beef was tender and juicy, the broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts were melt in your mouth--tender. The rice was steamed to perfection. My husband's Happy Family had tender bites of chicken, beef and shrimp with tender carrots, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, baby corn, water chestnuts, etc.  During the course of our meal, our waiter was fantastic. He came and checked on us several times and made sure our drinks were refilled and everything was good. He cleared away our dishes and was prompt with bringing our bill out and processing the payment.  My husband and I will be back in the future. I recommend this restaurant as a good place to dine."}
{"text":"If you love spicy, but not to spicy, try the Southwest Benedict...amazing. Had it this morning, can't wait to have it again very soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times, the most recent being last night following the Austrailian Pink Floyd Tour concert. So keep in mind that a Plus-1-Star kicker is in play because of awsome concert afterglow.  My experience with the service has varied here. Last night it has a bit impatient and aloof. That's OK, I was at a Casino restaurant at 11:45 pm. That's a take-what-you-can-get situation.  Last night's fare was the Happy Family meal off the Asian portion of the menu. I asked for the dish to be made spicy. Overall, I give it a 2 out of five. The flavor was on the downside of OK. The chicken and beef were tough and the shrimp was overcooked, so the texture was off. As I was eating I couldn't keep myself from thinking how long ago the meats had originally been cooked prior to being pulled again from the fridge and reheated for my order. Amid all those things, the dryness of the fried rice and complete absence of spiciness were most dissappointing.  I've had better mileage with the B.C. Grind burger. I'll go back to that next time I'm desperate for eats at the Casino."}
{"text":"Came here after a day at a conference the resort was hosting.  Party of 6 We ordered appetizers, shrimp cocktail, boneless wings and spring rolls. All were tasty. Entrees , not so much. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was lacking any sort of seasoning. 2 of my friends ordered the chipotle Mac and cheese, which was a HUGE portion,but not so tasty. Drinks were good though. Service was great, just wish the entrees were better"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner before a show and had the BC Burger that was very good cooked right on a fantastic egg bun. The steak fries were crispy yet fluffy on the inside. She had the Beef Hunan and it was very good too nice balance of flavor. Highly recommend. The service was quick and gracious. Great job everyone."}
{"text":"It was good from what I remember."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting this cafe over the weekend. The Entourage here was nice. My little one had pancakes and I had a cheeseburger.  About the pancakes: they where a nice size, we received 3 but the pancakes where like rubber. They where extremely hard to cut into and lacked flavor.  About the cheeseburger: that was one of the best burgers and fries. The meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. The size of the burger was pretty good as well!  The biggest grip I have is, our wait staff not offering refills on the drinks. Most of us had finished our drinks before the meals even arrived and not once did we get 1offer. I know I was opened to paying more if there were no free refills on fountain drinks.  Yes we did have a party of 8-10 but that doesn't mean we weren't thirsty!  Oh well, you live and you learn!"}
{"text":"Located inside Talking Stick Resort, this place really surprised me! Before heading into one of Talking Stick's Release pool parties, my husband and I decided to grab some sushi at the Blue Coyote Cafe, and we were very impressed. The sushi was fresh, unique, and a great value for the price. The presentation was top notch, and tasted delicious! By far some of the best sushi we've had in the Valley -- and we eat sushi quite a bit. The trick is to sit at the sushi bar and chat up the chefs :)"}
{"text":"If you want to be made to feel like your bartender doesn't give a sh*t about you go to the Blue Coyote Cafe in the Talking Stick Resort and order some food to go. I was left feeling like I was a significant inconvenience to Robert.   Add to that a pretty mediocre burger that in no way is actually a half pound as listed in the menu and you have a pretty solid equation for dissatisfaction. This burger was perfectly formed like the kind you can buy in a frozen sleeve from Costco. There was no real flavor and it was slapped together on a brioche bun for $10. Too much money for sub-par food.   Before leaving, I had asked Robert for an extra set of plastic flatware but that request went unresponded to and he disappeared from view. So I left, wishing I hadn't tipped so quickly after receiving the bill, not knowing the service would deteriorate exponentially soon thereafter. Oh and the side salad I requested in lieu of french fries came with no salad dressing, a fact I did not become aware of until I arrived at my destination after leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"Recently had breakfast here while waiting for a business meeting to start. Service was fast and very friendly. I went with the Egg White frittata and it was delicious. I love that for coffee they give you a man sized cup and leave the pot. Nice place."}
{"text":"Blue Coyote Cafe is definitely one of the better options at Talking Stick, but that isn't saying much. Food was average, and the service was slow and extremely disorganized (for example- three different servers handled our bill. THREE!)  I had the Eggs Benedict, and it came with a few moldy pieces of fruit. Aside from that, our meals weren't terrible, but the service really left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I got the Cashew Chicken with white rice; shall I just say bland, bland & bland. I tasted exactly 1 Cashew and no flavor throughout this meal. My drink was good, very flavorful, but where the heck is the alcohol? What the heck, I'm done, hopefully the Casino experience will make up for it!"}
{"text":"12/21/10  Came in w/ Mom and a coworker, and we sat at the counter.  We've heard that select sushi rolls were 1/2 off during happy hour (3p-7p) Mondays through Fridays, but we saw nothing on the short menu that we wanted to try.  I decided to order the BBQ bacon burger and a seaweed salad, while Mom and coworker ordered seaweed salads and a rainbow roll to share.  Have you ever tried a seaweed salad before?  We have, and we've had them from many Japanese/sushi restaurants, but never have we seen them served w/ carrots and cucumbers before.  Until now.  We've also never seen them WITHOUT sesame seeds.  Let's hope that this was a fluke, or else I'd question the quality of sushi that this kitchen produces.  Needless to say, the seaweed salads weren't good- I took one bite and decided to pass on the salad and waited for my burger to arrive.  The other two removed the non-authentic items and ate the seaweed, even though they also didn't particularly care for them.  The rainbow sushi that came after looked very dry, so I didn't even sample it.  Mom and coworker both remarked that it was tasteless and dry.  Thank goodness that the burger entree was delicious!  I ordered it with BBQ sauce on the side, and to be honest, I didn't miss it.  The patty was thick and juicy, and I appreciated the crispy thick-sliced applewood-smoked bacon.  I don't know which I liked better, the burger or the seasoned wedge fries.  These reminded me sour cream & onion potato chips- yum!  I may go back and give happy hour sushi another try, but I wouldn't mind having more of those fries!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend because Ive been craving sushi.  It was located inside Casino Arizona and we were seated pretty quickly.  The service was great and the food was not too bad either.  Not the best sushi Ive had in the least, but it wasnt the worst.  I got my sushi fix at least.  Would I eat there again? Sure."}
{"text":"Had breakfast on a Wednesday morning, and found it fairly decent.  This place is a \"cafe\" so I don't understand the reviews that complain about sushi or service at the bar, did it use to be a sushi bar?  Anyway, it seems to be a Cafe now, and breakfast wasn't bad.  Service was good, food was good, and prices and portions weren't bad.  It's an above average cafe for breakfast.  Not the best, but not bad.    I really can't comment on the Sushi or service at the bar, frankly it's not the kind of place I would go for Sushi or to hang out at the bar, so if that's what you're after, you probably get what you should expect.  But it's decent for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ruby our server was the sweetest server I've had in awhile. Also our bus boy was incredibly kind. Shared a club sandwich and wonton soup with my boyfriend with iced teas. Everything was delicious!   Bonus for us was that we got to play keno while we enjoyed our meal. Dyanna the keno lady was awesome!   Will surely return in the future after a pool day.   5/5"}
{"text":"I usually go about once a week. I've never had anything bad. Some of the stars have been the crazy roll, which is crazy good.. the spicy tuna has some of the realist freshest tuna in the valley. The yellowtail with house made ponzu is a nice bright change from your typical soy wasabi dip."}
{"text":"Our reservation at Orange Sky for 30 was miscommunicated, so we ended up at Blue Coyote on a last minute basis.  They sat 30 of us at three tables on the patio with three servers.  The service was both friendly and attentive and the ticket times were reasonable considering the size of the party.  My filet was cooked perfectly.  Very satisfying."}
{"text":"Great food and value!  I would not miss this spot if passing through Walking Stick for the afternoon.    We were pleasantly surprised with our chicken nachos--better than most gastropub nachos!   Our salads were crisp and refreshing.  Highly recommend the spinach salad."}
{"text":"Was super surprised by the quality food served here!!! Excellent enchiladas verdes and steak burrito was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Sloooooooow!!!! Ordered a light snack and 30 mins later, we were informed that there was a problem with the wok! How might one break what may be the simplest cooking device, no clue. After all that, the Thai green curry was actually quite good. And a lot of food for abt 7 bucks. The wife's chicken & rice dish was tasty as well, and they did make it right by giving us one of them for free."}
{"text":"great sushi available until 10pm nightly.  their sushi happy hour is great with $3 wells and $5-6 delicious rolls. their crunch roll is exceptional.  i have not tried the 24 hour restaurant but i've heard good things!"}
{"text":"We had two dinners in this place.  First time I had the happy family Asian. The portions are huge the dish was good. The second time I had a chicken with cashews and for some reason it was not too tasty, too much onion. My partner had a steak with French fries it was tasty but the first time he had a Mongolian Beef it was a little too spicy.  The service was too slow and we got a breakfast /lunch menu at dinner time."}
{"text":"This is hidden downstairs in the back of the Casino (near the pool). The breakfast here is an excellent value if you aren't feeling the massive \"Wandering Horse\" buffet upstairs. They are open 24/7 and I can vouch for their 4am steak & shrimp dinners."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna roll is pretty good, big pieces of tuna, not the usual mayo mix. Nice sushi chefs, good happy hour prices, not a large sushi selection though.  (They did tell me they were in the process of expanding it.)"}
{"text":"This is solely for the Spinach Salad I ordered EVERY night for room service staying @ Talking Stick. Maybe it is because I am Canadian, but this is the BIGGEST salad of life! Ok not like Cheesecake Factory size, but a damn good portion for late night munchies for a great price! Also when my fiancee and I got in late on Saturday we came down for dinner around 11pm and ate in the dining room. I wish so badly I could rem the lady that served us, but wow was she sweet! So attentive and nice! Brought me like 5 different hot sauces when I asked if they had any sauce. She wanted to make sure I got what I was asking for. Grrr still makes me mad that I can't remember her name to acknowledge her great service! Anyways, this is a GREAT place for late time food, order in/take out/room service!"}
{"text":"While not a big fan of casinos, and I would not have gone here if not for a friend's birthday in the upper bar, the fact is we did end up here for food.  I wasn't dissatisfied, the food was certainly okay and reasonably priced.  The ambiance reminded me of my college cafeteria ... drab and dull and lifeless.  The server was okay, sort of in the way like that rare occasion you may say that about a server at Denny's.  The menu seems to change often so no use describing what I had, it's no longer on the menu.  I would best describe the Blue Coyote as grab and eat and go back to gambling.  Hmmm, that could very well be their plan.  Yelp filtered several \"reviews\".  I think they missed a few.  Some of the ones left a smell way too much of planted reviews from staff and owner.  That would be sad ... it would be better to use that energy to make the restaurant better, not to try to fix the ratings.  Not saying I'm sure that's what's up, but ya know ..."}
{"text":"Awesome Food~!  Excellent Service~!  A. MGR. NICOLE SAFEDY AND HER STAFF (ALEX) ARE THE SWEETEST, NICEST, MOST WELCOMING FOLKS WE HAVE EVER MET~!

We will definitely be back and will refer all our friends~!   ;)"}
{"text":"The food was so good a couple years ago. Crab Mac and cheese was to die for. The menu now is small and just okay. They didn't have the crab Mac anymore. Service was just ok too.  Boneless chicken wings were just mini chicken bites you would find in sweet and sour chicken or some Asian dish.  My salad with chicken was good though. Just hard to eat since it was filled to the max."}
{"text":"Good experience.  Very attentive service, and pretty damn good food.  There are two shining stars of Talking Stick Resort - the hotel rooms and the Blue Coyote.    I had the mushroom ravioli and a Caesar salad.  I'd definitely recommend both.    One pleasant surprise?  The drink prices weren't out of control.  I had expected them to be horribly overpriced given what I'd seen at other places inside TSR, but the large Asahi was only $7.  A bargain, relatively speaking."}
{"text":"We drove over for Christmas dinner tonight and were very disappointed with the Blue Coyote Cafe.  We arrived at 7:00 PM and were quoted a 45 minute wait which actually was 25 minutes.  The service was extremely slow  from our server and we had to ask his assistant for our coffee and soda 20 minutes after ordering. We drove down from Shea because the web site listed a holiday dinner.  After we were seated our server informed us it was sold out.  Had the hostess indicated this 30 minutes earlier we would have tried another restaurant. The Asian woman assisting our male server at table 20 was helpful and brought us refills.  Our server checked back with us 30 minutes after delivering our food which was worthless.  We were angry by then because our food was cold when we received it from the kitchen.  My steak was good and warm but the butter served on it never melted because it wasn't hot.  My baked potato and asparagus were cold and wouldn't melt butter. My wife's burger was also served cold. For such a beautiful facility this is a disappointing experience.  We saw others that were equally disappointed and returned their food but a lot of the bad experience seemed to revolve around our Asian server who would disappear for long periods.  We waited 20 minutes to get our check at the end and were forced to ask another server for assistance as ours was MIA. The meal took an hour and a half and we weren't lingering over our food because we couldn't wait to get out.  We definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here & give the sushi happy hour a try. I was extremely impressed. The prices & service were great & the sushi here was absolutely phenomenal. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's inside of TSR and it offers sushi bar seating, indoor seating and patio seating. Patio seating is beautiful this time of year when it's dark outside, and they have fire pits lit nearby which creates a relaxing ambiance. Asian food is the cuisine of choice here. We always order sushi here at the bar, but you can also dip into their delicious noodle bowls! I have tried the chicken lo mein (you can't go wrong) and twice cooked chicken dish that ended up being slightly salty but still good. Pricing is relatively reasonable here, surprisingly. Service is okay. I love their food though and I love that they're open all night so I an get something in my belly after a night in old town."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar and had sushi and a Bloody Mary. Wasn't crazy about either one. The seafood roll had tiny frozen shrimp that I left uneaten. The price was right at happy hour, but I am here at the resort for 5 days and won't be back to this dining spot."}
{"text":"We ordered several things of sushi.  It was very good.  Tasty, well done and we had so much we were actually full.  They gave us extra wasabi for me ad extra plum sauce for my woman.  Service was prompt and efficient, but not extra friendly.  It's a relatively new facility (a year old?) so it's a nice place.  Decor is pretty plain, nothing real special.  I had a Kentucky Mint Iced Tea and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.  If I have one complaint about this place it's the prices.  I already dropped $100 gambling.  You would think they would have cheaper prices on the eats so you would come back more."}
{"text":"Overall I was disappointed in the food.   12 meals. The chicken in various meals was over cooked and dry. Mac n cheese with crab wasn't very cheesy and bland. The hummus was also subpar.   The burgers looked good.  I would skip this restaurant. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"great dining experience with the best 2 sushi chefs... funny and very interactive.  Fully worth sitting at the counter, which at first looks questionable and not the spot, but completely wrong,... its cool and can be and can't wait to go back.   By the way, fresh shipments on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays.... Saturday too at times."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here one morning while staying at the Talking Stick Resort.  We were lucky enough to score an outside seat in the sun.  Being from Seattle it was so nice to enjoy breakfast in 80 degree weather in March!    I ordered the Belgian Waffles with fruit on top.   It was good but unbelievably sweet!  The eggs and bacon all came out good.  But in the end the food was just ok.  Nothing blew me away.   Our waiter was very nice an attentive -- but the rest of the staff kind seemed like they were just droids doing work on auto."}
{"text":"This is the only place where you can get goooood late night Asian food!  So if you are out partying in Old Town Scottsdale, please sure to stop by here.  Order any of the Fried Rice dishes! It's sooooo yum-yum!  Another favorite is the Wanton Soup! Mmmmmm, mmmm!  I promise you will love it!!!  Remember this is the Casino Arizona located on Indian Bend off the 101."}
