{"text":"Chips they serve are amazing! I usually do not like/eat chips - but these are a definite try! We went on an evening, before the dinner crowd. They were not busy, or waitress was attentive, friendly and helpful. They have an extensive beer list....which includes cider! They also offer beer combination \"cocktails.\" I had a burger that was cooked the way I ordered it (medium) and was delicious. The crowd picked up by the time we were leaving. Nice atmosphere. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I had the vegetarian Bahn Mi sandwich which was amazing!!! The mozzarella balls were soooo good.We went during \"happiest hour\" and I had the app, the burger & a Dortmunder for $13. Portions were HUGE also. U really can't beat that. I definitely will be back. WE NEED ONE ON THE EASTSIDE!!"}
{"text":"A friend got me a takeout short rib sandwich that tasted awesome a few months back. Made me want to sit down and eat there.  Took a while, but I finally dined in for the first time because I heard they had half price burgers for happy hour.  For $6 I got a juicy, perfectly medium cooked burger with a mound of homemade fry's. The bun was toasted perfect without getting dry. It held up nice considering all the juices/sauces/ melty cheese. I haven't tried much of the menu, but I had a great meal for a good price.  And they accommodated my vegetarian friend nicely. My service was pretty good. Made sure I had what I needed. Drinks always full (I can go through a lot of tea in a meal), and she didn't hesitate to bring us sauces.     The decor is nothing special, but I like the open kitchen.  One issue is they give you homemade pickles, but if the pickle isn't as good as just a store-bought zesty kosher spear, than you aren't making pickles the right way. They weren't terrible, but they just tasted like a cucumber that sat in a vinegar and salt bath. Not like a real pickle. Yes, that's a small gripe, but I LOVE most things properly pickled, so do it right!  Overall, good food and my service was good. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"The food is terrific and the menu isn't flooded with stereotypical meals. Countless times I've had a hard time choosing what to get!  Their sauerkraut balls are amazing, as well as the beer selection. The one downside has been the service. Rather slow when the restaurant isn't full and they don't seem to take it into consideration. I once waited 45 minutes to get my meal or a refill on drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone here every Saturday afternoon for 5 weeks now.   We have tried the steak and potato salad, which, in my opinion is the best on the menu.  The steak comes with a sirloin, besides the severe under-seasoning, the steak has always been tender.  I don't typically order sirlion, so I was surprised I liked it. The fries on the salad are delicious, but what fries aren't?  The house-made French dressing, tastes like nothing more then bottled French dressing mixed with mayo. I have also tried the Aporkalypse Now Burger.  It has bacon, pork tenderloin, and Canadian bacon on it. I've gotten this twice. Both times the meat is severely overcooked and dry.  We've also had the same server every time we come in and she has yet to give us a friendly greeting or recognition.   Maybe the bar is better, I'm sure we'll try it, I really want to like this place!"}
{"text":"This place has gone so far down hill it is practically underground. It used to be our go-to once a week restaurant but over the past two years the quality of the food declined continuously. The (complementary) chips are way over-seasoned, the fries are so greasy they border on soggy, and the medium rare burger while usually acceptable in color tends to be about as moist as a piece of cardboard. What a loss."}
{"text":"Second time there tonight.  Great food and good service both times.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have to give this place 1 star. I've never written a negative review of any business,  but this was SO bad, I had to.  They put a vegan sandwich on the menu so people who have a vegan in the group could consider it a viable option. It's not.  I took a bite and tried to figure out why all the moisture was immediately sucked out of my mouth. The Gardein chicken was so over cooked it was in layers similar to shale. My apologies to our lovely Earth which gives us shale. I emailed Gardein to suggest they ask Jammy Buggars to remove their name from the menu.  Usually fries can be the saving grace of any restaurant,  but they even managed to have terrible fries. Taking a bite of those mealy things was a bit of a shock. I didn't know fries could be so bad.  All of this would've been rectified at most restaurants when the server asked how the food was, but the bartender never did. He didn't even question that he removed a full plate of food from in front of me. If he had, I would've ordered something different. He would've increaded my check total because I wouldn't have asked for it to be a replacement. I have worked in a restaurant for years so I don't like to be difficult. In his defense, his phone was keeping him busy. I wish he would've told us what was so funny,  but that would've involved acknowledging we were there and he didn't want to.  I always find a silver lining and I've never said that I won't go back to a restaurant.  The silver lining here is that I've now had the experience of saying I'll never go back there. It's always good to try something new !"}
{"text":"I waited too long to try this place. Great service. Prompt and courteous. The food is great. Professionally prepared and elegantly presented. This is what dining in Lakewood should always be. Wonderful beer selection just makes this place even better. All those cookie-cutter chains out there could take a lesson."}
{"text":"Not so much a restaurant as a bar with better-than-average bar burgers and sandwiches.  As someone said, it's often (not always) less crowded than the restaurants closer to the center of downtown Lakewood and/or the Buckeye Beer Engine.  As local burgers go, I'm not sure whether the Beer Engine or Jammy's makes a better burger, but Jammy's gets a point for better service overall and a nicer old-timey bar atmosphere as opposed to sports bar.   The menu is not terribly extensive but there are a number of good burgers and sandwiches, several named after local landmarks like the now-razed Detroit Theater. The turkey burger is better than average, the beef burgers are solid and with respect to the sandwiches the Jammy Hammy Sammy (basically a glorified hot ham n' cheese) was a good pick.  This place doesn't seem to be about weird toppings or interesting flavor combinations, but they are good at cooking what they do offer.  They also emphasize the fries which are thick-cut and made for dipping in various sauces or loading with toppings.  I'm pretty meh about all that since I prefer my fries shoestring, crispy, and unadorned.  i did notice that fries come with the sandwich and the server tends to forget to ask you what kind of dip you want, meaning that sometimes they just toss in some dip of their choice and other times I have gotten no dip at all.  Seems weird they do not ask you for a dip preference given that the menu seems to feature the dip option.  Anyway, I prefer Jammy's sweet potato waffle fries, which don't need any dip.    This would probably be a three-star if I had to drive far to get to it, but since it is not far from my relatives' house in Lakewood and offers takeout, I'm happy to add a star for convenience.  I can also eat in here if I wanted to drink a few beers with my food, but it's a pretty bare-bones dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"Same as it ever was: mediocre; however, this is in Cleveland where expectations are already incredibly low. In this case, Jammy Buggars is better than you'd expect but just a notch below your neighborhood Applebee's."}
{"text":"This is a great place that a friend introduced me to. The 25 cent wings on Thursday nights are a steal, and well worth a visit to this establishment!  The menu selection is just right with a little of everything, but not exhausting, and the items on it are of great quality and served in hearty servings.  The beer selection is very good, as they offer a wide variety of styles and craft beers.  I highly recommend Jammy Buggars!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good plate of fries last night, so we stopped in here. Got seated right away, even though this place looked really busy for the dinner rush. Our server was on it. She was friendly, and got us drinks, and more chips while we waited for our food. The menu has lots of red meat options, a few chicken/pork, and like 3 noodle entrées. I ordered The Ex with bacon on it. When it arrived i went for the pickles on my plate first. Their house made pickles are SUPER acidic. They made the sides of my tongue hurt pretty bad, although I'm sensitive to very acidic foods. I had to keep rinsing my mouth with water after eating them.The bacon on my sandwich was crispy, the avacado was fresh AF and there was a ton of it on there along with a pile of tomato, and thickly cut fresh mozzarella. I could smell the basil in the pesto without even taking a bite. The bread on the sandwich itself was too toasted. It stabbed at my mouth after a few bites. Ouch!  Fries were perfect, and they serve Not Your Father's Root Beer, one of my faves. I spent 50 bucks including tip on the two of us (4 drinks, 1 burger, 1 sandwich) Over all a good experience."}
{"text":"I love Jammy Buggers.  It's my favorite place to eat in Lakewood.  The service is generally good, but whenever I go I'm never in a hurry, and I always sit at the bar.  So I can't really review the service for the servers.  I've met the owner plenty of times since I'm there so often and he's very friendly, and always says hello.  I'm obsessed with the dipping sauces for the fries, they're awesome.   I always leave feeling way too full because I can never stop eating them.  Their burgers are fantastic, but my favorite sandwich is the Susan flipping the bird, more recently called \"The Ex\".  I could eat that every day.   My boyfriend loved the grilled cheese and those spicy buffalo chicken egg-rolls, he's hoping they making a reappearance on the menu soon.  The mac n cheese is good, but the sausage was a bit too spicy for me.  I think it's reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you get too.  Check it out!   My only suggestion: I wish they had a larger cider selection.  I'm not a beer drinker and they generally only have Griffin on draft.  I'm glad they are supporting local companies, but it would be nice to have a couple more to select from."}
{"text":"What I would consider traditional pub/American fare with a creative twist, done absolutely right. If you are going to eat something that came out of the fryer, let it be from Jammy Buggars. Service is exceptional, I have been a handful of times and have always been treated especially well. Attracts a diverse crowd, good for a date or for a family. I like the chorizo burger, the beer selection, and the fish and chips"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Jammy Buggars since December and the experience has always been excellent.  We arrived at about 5:00 on a Saturday evening and it was already getting crowded.    We were seated right away and our waiter, Calvin, took our drink orders immediately.  I was torn between the Hawaiian Pork sandwich (which I'd had before and LOVE) and the Lobster/Shrimp Roll (which I hadn't yet tried).  Calvin recommended the Lobster/Shrimp Roll and it was excellent!  There are actually two smaller sandwiches (served in grilled New England style rolls) and home-made pickles and fries.  Unlike past visits (when the fries were PERFECT) they were a TINY bit underdone for my liking, but not enough to send back.  The sauces were, as usual, delicious.  I chose the Jammy Buggar and BBQ sauces, but I've had the garlic mayo before and like it, too.  My Better Half ordered the turkey burger and LOVED it.  As usual she ordered the sweet potato waffle fries because she's a weirdo and she said they were cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is to expand the dessert menu.  They currently only offer a caramel apple cheesecake which isn't for everyone.  Otherwise I think this place has great food, friendly and attentive staff and is reasonably priced (dinner and soft drinks for 2 was about $30 plus tip)."}
{"text":"Mozzaballs are the bomb! Great vegetarian options & very quick carry out service ! A regular place for us when we dont want pizza"}
{"text":"Everything my Husband and myself had was very good, will certainly be making this a regular place to eat at. The atmosphere was nice enough for special events , but also relaxed enough for every day. The blue cheese was slightly sweet, I can;t wait to have it again on Thursday at their wing night!"}
{"text":"I had heard this place has great burgers. Unfortunately, I was in a non meat mood the night we went there and tried the veggie burger and crab balls. Both were fried to death. The taste of the crab balls was okay, but was over run by the frying. The veggie burger had good tasting veggies on top and I liked the siracha mayo, but the veggie burger was like fried mush and totally fell apart. The person I was with got the Detroit Burger and liked it. I just had wished I tried a regular burger after this experience. Will try it again just to see. The server was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been looking forward to date night here for a while and were not disappointed. We came on a Monday night and were surprised by the number of families with young children, despite the marketing of the place as more of a bar; either way, we got nice seating in a little back area.   We both got burgers - I had the Smokey and he had the Del Feliz Fernando, and both were delicious with interesting flavor combinations. If you're going to spend 10-12 dollars on a burger, do it at Jammy's, where they really care about creating unique stuff. I am also obsessed with their fries and dipping sauces!  Our server, a youngish guy, could have been a bit more attentive but we enjoyed ourselves and I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! This was honestly the best \"casual\" meal I've had in a long time. I had the mushroom Swiss burger with loaded fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and came with a large portion of some sort of mayo. The bun wasn't overly bready, which was nice. The loaded fries were the best I've ever had! Usually, loaded fries get cold and have slightly hardened/congealed cheese unless you eat them right away. These were covered in a white cheddar sauce that stayed melty and warm until I ate them after my burger. The restaurant itself had a nice \"chill\" feel to it. I'm definitely looking forward to returning for another meal."}
{"text":"Since my office is nearby I get lunch here 3-4 times a month. The food has always been decent, staff is friendly but I always get it to go. Ordered my typical caesar salad with chicken today and got literally less than half the normal serving. I am not sure if business is bad and they are cutting back on the portions to save money or what but what I received for what I was charged was a disgrace. On top of that they gave me blue cheese dressing for my CAESAR salad. How hard is it to keep things organized and give the customer what they ordered? This will be the last time I ever get food from here again. There are so many places to eat in Lakewood I will have no problem going somewhere else. This is the last time they rip me off."}
{"text":"For some reason, the name of this place really bothers me and I avoided going there for awhile because I just couldn't get a grip. Totally irrational, I know. But when I finally did go, I loved it. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced, and they have a great wine special that I think allows you to have the whole bottle if you order two glasses of the same wine. That seems like too good to be true, so dont quote me on that. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was good. A great place for happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"We love this spot. We always come for happy hour because the prices can't be beat! $3 crafts and half off burgers! It like $20 for two people to have a great meal! The complimentary chips are a wonderful treat, and the extra dipping sauces are perfect. I've never left hungry;)"}
{"text":"Really nice place! Great and creative menu and an excellent beer selection. Definitely will go back :):)"}
{"text":"Food and Service was very good.  I felt the price of the burgers for what you received was a little high but that would be the only critique."}
{"text":"Food is ok and staff is nice. The problem is the owner going after customers if they send something back.  He threw a father and son because they sent back something that wasn't cooked properly!! That had to be one of the worst examples of being unprofessional."}
{"text":"Eating the Italian grilled cheese sandwich now and it is awesome!!!! The best fries in the city! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Very happy we tried this place after discovering it at the taste of Lakewood! The fries are the best part but everything was delicious. We will definitely be back for the specials too :)"}
{"text":"If I was only reviewing the food I would give 5 stars, as I've always had a good meal at Jammy Buggars.  The 3 stars is for the fact that there always seems to be at least a 20 minute wait, even when there are tons of empty tables.  Also, once you do get a table, service is usually slow.  The last time I went, my group of 3 waited 20 minutes for a table and another 25 minutes for food once we ordered.  Our waiter only came to our table twice - to take our order and bring our bill...our drinks sat empty for our entire meal.  Also, they have the large room on the side that it seems like they rent out at times, but when it's not rented it's just a big empty space that would greatly expand their seating if they put more than 3 tables inside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Their pretzel crusted fish is insane-with actual fresh fries is hard to beat i hope it never comes off the menu. Their brunch is the best breakfast in TOWN. I dont even like omelettes and i would eat theirs every week-and the potatoes are out of this world-i think they start them in the oven and finish in the fryer...not sure...but amazing. DEFinately stop in-....and family friendly"}
{"text":"This place has creative pub food and a nice laid-back atmosphere. I've had family dinners there as well as dinners with guests from out of town. Oddly, the only thing about the restaurant/food that keeps me from rating it five stars is the amount of salt in the food. Everything tastes super salty there. It's decent--just don't go if you are on a low salt diet :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. Service can be slow at times. I don't understand it.. I'll be waiting for my soda and the waitress will just be standing there staring off into space. If service were better, I would give 5 stars. Great for Lil buggar night. Recommend the OMG and the Ex. Sweet potato fries are delish but not sure they are worth the $3 upgrade."}
{"text":"Love this place! When it first opened, I was a bit reluctant to come here. The restaurant that this space used to house, Route 66 was awful. I was scared of the revolving location. But after some friends raved about it, I decided to give it a try.   Excellent food (wing night on Thursday), beer selection (especially drafts), and really great and friendly service. I've had a number of dishes: wings, the Susan, Lobster Roll, fries, mac and cheese, everything is delicious, with unique flavors and combinations.   Might be my favorite place to eat and drink in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant in Lakewood!  I have always really enjoyed the food.  The sandwiches, burgers, and entrees are all excellent.  My favorites are the OMG burger, pesto chicken sandwich, and mac and cheese.  They bring out some very tasty homemade BBQ chips to snack on while you check out the menu.  Also, there is a variety of dipping sauces for the fries which is a nice way to incorporate some extra flavor.  They have a large craft beer selection and great drink special on Tuesday, any beer for just $3!  Good service and atmosphere complete the experience and make this place a 5 star spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger special which was  ok, ( not for $13.00 dollars ok), but whatever. The bartender was rude in the sense that she told us that the kitchen was going to be close  in 6 minutes then I saw people order  20 minutes later! I mean if you don't want to work don't  rent yourself!!' It is rude!! I'm not going back, go to merry arts next door cheaper drinks and food as well"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3-4 times now. I really wanted to like it but there are certain things I can't abide. It's ridiculously overpriced for starters; I mean a $13 burger should be pretty ridiculously good, and I don't mind paying for quality. The flavor on the burger is fine, but it is always over-cooked, and noticably microwaved after being grilled. If you cut your burger in half and it starts pouring out steam, it's been microwaved, and is obviously overcooked when you're ordering it medium rare. I subbed out the fries (They're delicious it's a diet thing) for steamed broccoli which came out with absolutely no seasoning and in a bowl with a quarter inch of water in it. If you're again going to microwave my broccoli in a bag, that's fine, but drain it properly, add a little salt and pepper and maybe send it out with a lemon wedge or something. I used the one from my iced tea. My girlfriend got the steak salad which looked good, and the steak was cooked properly, but again did not have any seasoning on it. When lunch for 2 is $35 for a burger and a salad, it just needs to be better. The plus side of things is that the service has been great every time we've been there... but nothing can trump poorly executed food."}
{"text":"Wife ordered the OMG burger medium well came out bloody and red. Server was great and returned item, wife ordered a philly cheese steak which comes a few bloody pieces and chunks of meat with no flavor again server was amazing. Wife decided to not get any meat and went with a salad which came out instantly.  Short story manager still made us pay for Philly well you just lost some good clientele. My burger was ok not like it was last year. Consistency is number one for restaurants to succeed. Server was amazing food ok and manager terrible since she had the server do the dirty work instead of coming to the table to see what was wrong. Loved going up for apps and drinks not anymore we will being finding another establishment in lakewood."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to neighborhood bars. Great food, good beer selection, and excellent service.   I love the mac & cheese! They also have excellent burgers.   A good place for dinner or just to grab a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"I was pretty upset with my last visit. I actually have been going here for years and promote it to friends, in fact I took a friend with me and it was his first time there; but I am not sure about the attitude of the management anymore. I specifically ordered a sandwich I wanted take home and I forgot it, but I went right back. By the time I went back they threw it out and acted like no one had ever done that before, which is nonsense people do it all the time, in fact I have done it before as I do order extra to take home frequently, normally they hold it in the back. It's not like it was left overs it was the whole damn sandwich. And the manager did not even want to talk to me She seemed to just let the server try and sort it out. They could have at least offered me a discount or something on another one. It really ruined my night. I think from now on I will just head to eddy and eddy's they seem to have better service anyway. I was so excited to eat that sandwich and to think they just pitched really upset me. And the dismissive attitude about it really annoyed me, I could see if it was a swamped Saturday night but the place was not even busy. Take this review for what its worth to you, but I dine out frequently in Lakewood and I can tell you there are other place in this price range that seem to have there act better put together. I doubt I will go back or recommend the place again I will probably just tell people how they threw my sandwich out I have already told three people to see if its just me and they all said that's nuts they should have held it in the back for awhile. So I am by no means the first one to do this like they think.   Anyway its hard to review the food this time since i did not get to eat it, but the beer i had was good. But since they did not make the beer and they thre my food ouit i have deffinitly had better."}
{"text":"The price is a bit high for me. However the burger was fantastic and the french fries. The meat you could tell was very fresh and flavorful. There happened to be a hair on my pickel so they did not charge me for my meal, which I was surprised by and very pleased. Will go back again when it's in my budget."}
{"text":"Delicious. There were 4 of us and we all were pleased with our food...and drinks (wine and beer). Great dipping sauces for the fries and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Upon sitting down and waiting a few minutes for our server to finally decide to get up from the corner behind the hostess stand and actually work. I was off-put by someone who didn't look like they even worked there sulk up and introduce themselves as such inquiring about our choice of beverage. Nice enough I guess, and it took me a while to get used to the fact his silly outdated grunge clothes are part of the work uniform.  I'll get straight to the point and say the fries were the best part of the visit. We both ordered burgers, mine being the basic cheeseburger, and her some burger with cheddar and crispy onions and maybe BBQ I don't know, don't really care, wasn't anything special. Both were specified medium and were far from it. The burgers were dry as it appeared, but the \"grass fed\" beef left much to be desired. I'm a straight up dill pickle guy, not a fan at all of there house-made pickles. No reason for sweet/tart pickles, let alone being sweet in any way.  Then the awful creatures starting shuffling inside in droves. If its one thing I can NOT stand is kids in any restaurant that don't have a shred of decent behavior in public. Damn parents. I guess it was kids night? Had I known this I never would have come. We finished our mediocre meal and at least was surprised to see our burgers were 50% off for happy hour. But, Kurt Cobain failed to mention that. Left just in time right when the asshole kids nearby started screaming about who knows what. Don't see another visit from me in the future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great wait and bar staff, and awesome food. Huge craft beer list and a comfortable environment. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I went here recently after being a bit turned off by some of their menu changes.  I'm glad I went back.  I had the cheese steak which was very good and filling.  There is probably more of a family friendly vide than a dinner date  environment here, at least when I was there around 6:00 on a Friday.  They do still play a lot of black keys which I like along as it's not that new stuff."}
{"text":"I went on 25 cent wing night (Thursday). Every time I go I get the frenchy fries. They are thick cut and you can pick out whatever sauces you want (for an additional fee). The garlic mayo sauce is kind of sweet-- I like it to be more garlic than sweet. The malt vinegar mayo is the best, perfect vinegar tang to it.. I could eat so much.   The ranch dressing there is OUTSTANDING. All of the wing flavors are unique and delicious, the lime butter wing sauce is good and so is the unique Cleveland wing sauce.   Good bar food. I went there on my 23rd birthday and they serve 40 0z bottles of beer in brown paper bags its kind of funny to be served that way.. People were def staring."}
{"text":"Honestly, the first time I went into this restaurant I was unsure. This spot has been home to many, many failed restaurants in the past. I sat down my buddy and grabbed some food. And my mind was blown. The food is 100% top notch bar food. Good atmosphere. Great service. I dont come there as often as I would like but when I do, I know im in for a great meal. Theyre brunch is on point, their dinner menu is solid, and I can usually find a good beer there. I really hope they continue to break the trend of that building and stay successful."}
{"text":"The happy hour is amazing. I mean the burgers are so delicious that come with sweet potato fries which are perfect or even onion rings that have a great batter. I would go back here once a week if possible. Oh and the appetizer chips they bring to the table when you sit down are incredible!!"}
{"text":"I was fine. I had the Ruben burger. It really needed more sour kraut ...  the fries were fresh and  tasty .   I would try a different type of burger next time ..."}
{"text":"Ok, I seriously just signed up to mention the burger.  I know this place just opened so I wanted to add to their budding reputation for their most amazing, meltingly delicious, perfectly cooked, and best heavenly mind blowing burger.  Best I've had in recent (lifelong) memory.   I didn't even order it.  My sister did and gave me her half hour old leftovers and I ate all of it, after eatin my meal, in 5tastic bites that I will never forget.    I am a cook in service industry +10 years.  The fish and chips I helped eat were flippin rippling through my brain.  I ordered the pulled pork with Mac n. cheese.  Though the pork was a touch too sweet, the macadamia nuts are super smart and fun!   The Mac and cheese, was a bit disappointing for something fairly simple.  Served hot, they were watery and under seasoned.  BUT!!! the Mac was perfectly cooked, and added to the leftover pulled pork, looks like a great breakfast!   My brother and his gf ordered the majority of the vegan items and were happy for the most part.  Mostly with the vegan chicken gyro.  Great meal overall, solid beer selection, decent service,and fairly pleasant ambience.  Good job."}
{"text":"I love love love Jammy Buggars. My boyfriend first took me here last year, and I have been addicted ever since. I love their shrimp and crab roll with the lemon sauce drizzled on it in a toasted bun ... yummmm. Also, they make their own dressing, so I usually sub a side salad instead of fries. And anyone who knows me, they know that I am always on the lookout for a great white French dressing. Well, they might not serve white French dressing here, but their French dressing is as close as I can find and it is DELICIOUS. I also love their rotating specials menu -- there is always a great burger or appetizer on it. The only thing I didn't like about it the last time we went was that we sat in the weird side room to the left. I don't think I will be requesting to sit in there ever again."}
{"text":"Another Great Meal from Jammy's.  Greeted at the door, bbq chips on the table, beer special for the hubby.  The burger was perfectly done, tender, juicy and delicious.  I really love the 'cucumber chunks' as I'm not a dill pickle lover.  My husband ordered a burger that tasted like a really excellent roman burger.  Fries fresh and crisp.  Brought two friends who hadn't been there before.  She absolutely LOVED the veggie burger and her fiance raved about his OMG burger.  They were impressed with the wine offering (buy two glasses and get the rest of the bottle FREE), before 7:00pm.    The restrooms are pretty darn COLD (especially for us girls), my only complaint.  A little heater in there would be a nice touch.  Server was EXCELLENT!!!!!!  And PLEASE PEOPLE, when tipping the server, don't forget to TIP on the entire value of the meal!  Let's not short the servers!!!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here once before and got the burger special.  I remember thinking it was just ok.  My sister lives in Lakewoood and is always raving about this place, so we got takeout at her place a couple weeks ago.  This time, however, I thought the food was awesome.  My husband had some kind of philly sandwich, my sister had the ex, and i had a chicken sandwich.  they were all good, but the fries were excellent.  love the variety of fry sauces!  my sister also loves this place bc they have more vegan options than most places."}
{"text":"Unofficial Auntie Amy and I checked out Jammy Buggars (first time for me, she'd already been before) for lunch yesterday. What a cool place! Casual, but not gross. They have tons of different types of fries, and a variety of burgers that you can have as a vegan option, chicken sandwich, etc. It was difficult to decide what to order, but I knew that anything I chose would be good, because it was comfort food elevated just a tad.  Auntie Amy and I decided to start with a shared order of the \"Frenchy\" Fries, which were plentiful, HOT, thick and seasoned really nicely. They were served with a garlic mayo (I refuse to say \"aioli,\" ok??!?) and they even gave us extra when we boxed up the leftovers.  I had an Ohio beef burger (grass-fed is what they boast) in the \"Classic\" style, which is served with your choice of cheese, lettuce, and tomato. While the burger was juicy and dense, I do agree with Kevin that it was a bit gristly and uneven in parts. So that was kind of disappointing, because when you have a great burger, it's just ... zen. With grease.  Speaking of grease, while the fries were not overly greasy at all, the burger was very heavy on the grease (or maybe it was butter; in any case, the bun was quite soaked in it). Some people may like that, but I was a little turned off.  However, the real standout was the service! This waiter was awesome. I wish I knew his name, so I could give him a shout-out, but he was there Friday at 1 to serve us. He was so nice, patient (while we sent him away multiple times because we still didn't know what we were ordering) and made good suggestions. He even brought out a sample of the fontina cheese when I asked him what it tasted like. I was just expecting him to compare it to another cheese, but he provided a little bit in a small condiment dish, and it just made my day!  One tip: the burgers come with fries. A LOT of fries. So, you probably don't need to order an extra order of special fries, unless you (like the two of us) really like fries."}
{"text":"We're leaving an updated review. Not much to say about our second visit. Service was better, even had the same waitress. Lots of families for the kids eat free on Monday. Interresting tid bit is they change the Nugget size for the kids meal on Monday vs any other night. Same nuggets half the size.  My biggest issue is the food. I had the bbq bacon burger and it was just blah. My wife had the Asian chicken sandwich and again lacking much flavor. We both left saying eh ok, not bad. When we want to love it. And the house sauce isjust not good  With so many choices in LW we'll not be back for awhile"}
{"text":"I was very bummed to see that Niko's closed (again... again... again), but was all sorts of curious to check Jammy Buggars out.  It's such a great location and a cool space that I was cautiously optimistic we had a winner once I looked at the menu.  I was incredibly impressed.  As a vegetarian, I didn't think I would have many options.  Surprisingly, there are not only vegetarian options, but vegan, too!  The other people with me got burgers and really enjoyed them.  All three of us got different choices of the dipping sauces for the fries... I great addition to the delicious sweet potato waffle fries!  They also have a pretty decent draft beer list.  A few I hadn't had before.  So, I'll be back to try a few more out!   Also, they're pretty darn smart to leave it on the dinner check to write a review.  I hope it works, because I'd like to see this restaurant build up it's business and succeed!"}
{"text":"Really nice beer selection and a fun place to hang out.  We had tow meals...fish & chips and a burger.  The fish & chips was a seriously large portion of flaky white fish that was crisp and lightly battered (not greasy). Their fries were really good as well.  I had the Detroit Theater burger which came with two patties of beef, \"secret sauce\", American cheese, house-made pickles, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onion rings.  I know it kind of sounds like a Big Mac, but the added bacon and onion rings gave it a really nice mix of flavors and textures."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, great beer list, creative menu, and the owner really cares about the quality and experience you have."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to celebrate her newfound employment, and we were not disappointed.  We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess, but it was a Monday evening, so I can't speak to wait times during busier hours. Our waitress quickly brought us house made barbecue chips and menus. Given the extensive beer selection, I was a bit surprised by how quickly she expected our beverage order, but, as is my custom, I was satisfied to point to the first red rye I saw on the draft list.  The beer came out quickly, and though I can't remember its name, I can recall that it was delicious.   The waitress returned quickly--but not too quickly this time--to gather our food orders, and to bring us another round of free chips. My wife went with the smokey burger, and I opted for the lobster roll with a side of wild mushroom soup. My wife's burger, which was topped with smoked cheddar, jalapeños, and crispy onions, looked amazing, and was confirmed by her to live up to its looks. My lobster roll was good, if not great, but the soup was really the star here. It was creamy, which I wasn't expecting--I'm used to clear-brothed mushroom soups--but the consistency was just right, and the flavor was phenomenal. Next time, I'll probably go for a bowl of the mushroom soup, and supplement with one of the starters, all of which sounded great.   They play it pretty safe with the ambience here; the lighting is dim, the decor doesn't draw attention to itself, and the wall behind the bar has a couple of big screen TVs. But whatever personality Jammy Buggars lacks, it makes up for in spades with flavorful food and quick and friendly service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Eh, I wasn't a fan.  Not because I didn't want to be.  Christmas Ale draft for $5 is a good price.  I was glad to see they have grass-fed burgers.  In ordered the Smoky burger.  It was cooked perfectly but the garlic was so, so overwhelming in it.  I couldn't eat it.  The side of fries took up more than 60 percent of the plate.  I should have ordered the beet salad.  I will go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"This is food favorite of mine, a place I have gone to time and time again.  One word... BBQ Chips.... ok that's two but they are out of this world. Instead of your traditional bread before a meal Jammy's bring out a bowl of their home made potato chips.  And the delicious dishes don't end there. They have some of the best balls in town.. you heard that right. They have mozzarella, sauerkraut, and many more to choose from. I personally recommend the mozzarella with the pesto and marinara sauce just can't be beat.   Their burgers and sandwiches are a great choice but their entrees are a selection of comfort foods.  But it is hard to say not to one of their burgers when they are 1/2 priced during happy hour Mon-Fri 3pm - 6pm.  They always have variety of specials and a decent beer selection. But their Wine deal of buy 2 glasses get the rest of the bottle free is by far my favorite.  All in all if you are looking for a great place with great selection and that's not gonna break the bank. Look no further.   And if you are a Brunch fan check out their newly added Sunday Funday Brunch! Where you can order a side of Biscuits and Gravy in addition to their delicious omelets and tasty breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"Jammy Buggar's has great burgers, amazing fries with dipping sauces and an awesome rotating beer list. Sports on tv, old school blues for background music - bot pluses for me. Jim, the owner is a great guy. There's a big back room available for large parties (book in advance). I'm sure before long this place will reach \"institution\" status."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I was always under the impression this was an upscale place so I was put off by all of the staff looking like homeless people.  I felt like I was in a skit of portlandia buttt hey the food was good so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The premeal order of chips were a nice touch and I rarely eat potato chips. The burger was fresh and delicious. Wide array of mayo based dipping sauces for the fries. Im not into mayo so I ate the honey mustard which was pretty good. My wife went with a salad complete with fresh peaches and  a variety of other fruits. she raved about it and ate the entire plate which is very inlike her. if she finishes a plate of food I know she liked it. If you want a burger and a cool atmosphere  this is the place. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is always packed with a good energy. The beer selection is amazing. They have two dishes that I can't seem to go wrong with. The summer seasonal salad, which they keep through the winter is amazing. And then the lobster shrimp roll. So good! If you sit at the bar one serving of the bar-b-que chips will not be enough. The owner is awesome too, very personable. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because I had a chicken parm burger.     ---   ---   ---  Need I say more? Yes, a chicken parm burger. It's tough to pin point what I'd label as \"Cleveland Cuisine\" but this is about as Cleveland as it gets.  Why don't I ask chicken parm more? This is a great question, because it's wonderful. You know what else is wonderful? Burgers. I've definitely never seen these two delicacies combined, and I feel like that's kind of a tragedy, after seeing how well they worked together here.  You'd think I would have been in a non-ideal mood, considering I was on about 3 hours sleep at most when I visited. But you know why that couldn't be further from the truth? Because I was on 3 hours sleep after being up til 5am after Game 7 of the NBA Finals, and up around 8am to buy championship gear at Dick's Sporting Goods. That fact has very little to do with Jammy Buggars, but I just wanted to point out that it will always be associated with a championship in my eyes :)  Plus, their chalk board said \"Steph Curry is a wanker,\" which clinched the 5th star for me."}
{"text":"I've been wanting a lobster poboy for awhile now and I've finally found the place to get not one, but 2 for under $15 (I didn't know my meal came with 2 sandwiches)! Everything about my meal was great and I loved the dipping sauce choices for the fries and loved the complimentary chips while waiting for our meal."}
{"text":"Nice selection of food esp vegetarian options. I had the vegetarian bahn mi which was ok, a little bit dry and bland but the vegan chicken gyro was excellent. Came with house made thick cut fries & pickles. Definitely would go back but would probably chose something other than the veggie bahn mi. Reasonably priced, cute restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from our house, so we hit them up a lot during the week. We've never had to wait for a table, but we never go on weekends.   We have a 12-year old so we're looking for places that have great food, great drinks and are not hostile to kids, albeit mature kids. Jammy Buggars delivers every time on every point.  The menu is a good take on a \"pub\" menu and classics like their fish and chips are delicious and affordable and usually have an interesting twist. The burgers are excellent and I find myself thinking of Jammy Buggars as my default when I am thinking of burgers. Half the time I go thinking of a burger though, I end up with something else from the delicious menu. My wife is a big fan of the Melted Away and the Seasonal Salad.   The drink selection is another selling point. They have a decent selection of drafts and a creative menu of \"blends\" of different brews and ciders  Compared to the more over-hipstered, over-crowded and over-priced gastropubs in Lakewood, this is definitely a step above and much less pretentious. The staff have always been very friendly and attentive and we never feel rushed or ignored."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night - great selection of beers (good prices, too) but so-so food. We had the kraut balls for an app; they were alright, not anything special. I had the Remodeled Detroit, and my fiancé had the Alabama Cheesestake. Both were ok, but the fries were not great. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things - there menu does sound very fun, and I might be willing to try again. I would come back for a beer or two, though."}
{"text":"The burger and fries were good. They only had one waitress working and she was also the hostess."}
{"text":"My guy and I are very fond of our burgers. We are always looking to try new places. About a month ago, we gave Jammy Buggars a try.   I got there around 4:30pm. When I walked in I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. There was this grungy (think musical style not grody or anything) looking group of individual finally spoke up and told me I could sit wherever. I had no idea those were the waitstaff/host(Ess)Es.   They sat us down at a booth and they gave us some homemade bbq potato chips while we waited. I wasn't a fan, but I'm not one for those kinds of flavors.   We got two burgers with fries cooked medium as per usual. When we got them, they were definitely well done. People were starting to pour in so we just ate them as they were. They weren't terrible but they were rather dry.   I will say the best part of the meal was to find out it was happy hour and the meal was 1/2 off. I would consider giving Jammy Buggars another chance with that deal."}
{"text":"I typically absolutely love jammy buggers but I went this past weekend and my fiancé and I waited a very long time for our food. We didn't complain at all in fact the manager actually came over and apologized saying that the first sandwich that was made for us was too burnt so they had to re-make it. We were appreciative that he came and let us know why it was taking so long, but it still took another 15 minutes after the manager came over. Again we did not complain at all when they finally brought the food but when they brought the check over we were expecting to have maybe a drink or two comped or at least something for the long wait but there was nothing. Also, I forgot to mention that during the long wait I asked for more chips 2 times (they are free) because I was starving and the waiter just I guess forgot and never once brought us chips. I'm still giving it a four star because I love the food and atmosphere but the service was not good. The vegetarian burger is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Jammy Buggars on National Burger Day, so it should be fairly obvious what we were in the mood for! We were there at lunch time, and there was a pretty good crowd. There was only one waitress to take care of the whole place, so service was slow. Not her fault, by any means; seems like poor planning on ownership's part there.   The specific burger I ordered was the Akron burger, which is meant to be a tribute to Swenson's. It was indeed a tribute, complete with the special sauce, but it wasn't anywhere near as good as Swenson's. My girlfriend got a different burger and agreed; nothing to write home about. Pretty tasteless, pretty dry, just...OK. The fries didn't leave much of an impression either.   We had sticker shock when we got our bill. It was just way too high for average food at lunchtime. The whole experience was just kind of a bummer, because the atmosphere is great, and we had high expectations based upon that and other reviews. But between mediocre food offerings, understaffing, and overpriced fare, 2 stars seems about right. I hope they improve some things, because I love their location and decor, and I'd love to see them succeed."}
{"text":"This last meal we ate on a trip to Cleveland got me and each of my friends super sick. Avoid the guac."}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars is a cool spot. I love that they have options for carnivores, omnivores, vegetarians, vegans and just good ol' beer drinkers. :)   The happy hour is pretty legit and goes until 7 p.m....although, get there before 6 if you want the half-priced burgers! It was a little crowded when we got there but we were seated quickly. The food was alright this time...I got the vegan wings and they were kinda weird. I wanted to try something new and the waiter raved about them so I just had to!!! The only way I know how to describe them is a deep fried sweet potato loaf...very dense and not a ton of flavor. However! I've had great experiences here every other time I've been here so I couldn't base my review on just those alone.   Oh, and did I mention that they have a beer challenge? Go check this place out already!"}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant!  A bit eclectic!  Has great home made potato chips!  Very flavorful!  Had Asparagus soup and  house salad made with spinach, kale, carrots, raisins, sunflower seeds, garbanzo beans, feta cheese in a raspberry vinegarette dressing.  Has entertainment as well.  Moderate prices,  great atmosphere!  Good food!"}
{"text":"Went to the Lakewood Art Festival on Detroit. Decided to grab lunch. First time here.   I am giving this 4 stars because the girl who waited on us was very nice. And the cider on tap was this pineapple cider and it was very very good.   I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich that I thought from the description would be Asian and spicy. It was awful. It was not anything that I expected and I did not like the taste. It was creamy and the chicken was bland.   My partner order the cheeseburger and she loved it. Loved it. Said it was seasoned well and tasted great. Next time I know what to get.  So everything about this experience was good. Except for the pulled chicken sandwich I ordered that sat with me the rest of the day....    I guess I'll have to try it again."}
{"text":"We came here because we received a gift card. Maybe it was the lunch shift but service was a little harsh. Non-alcohol drinks are not listed and you are expected to psychically know what your options are. We ordered the crab balls, mozz balls, and loaded fries to start. The sauce on the edamame served with the crab balls had a taste I couldn't put my finger on. The balls were good and fries were awesome.  My husband had the lobster roll and said it was good. I had the burger with a lettuce bun and the execution was done poorly. The burger it's self was very good. It was comforting that their beef was locally sourced and grass fed. Overall, we would go here again for a beer and burger."}
{"text":"What a great find! First time here last night and really enjoyed it. Started at bar and planned to eat in dining room but stayed at bar for dinner. Very friendly bartender and wait staff. Good cross-section of young and old while we were there...some Lakewood places are just too young/hipster for us - not this place. Good happy hour deals on beer and wine plus great, complimentary home made chips at the bar. All of our meals were very good, but the fish fry was tops! Man can this place make GREAT French fries!!! Two different kinds - both were excellent!  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Wanted to be a little adventurous so stop by this place for lunch.  Atmosphere was pretty quiet and super clean.  My server was super nice and really helpful.  As he was telling me about the menu, one of the other servers came up and started talking about wheat beer.  No excuse me or anything, I just thought it was a little rude.  Ordered the BBQ potato chip crusted Smoked Pork Loin sandwich on a pretzel bun.  I thought it was pretty good, wasn't dry-seasoned well.  Definitely wasn't a fan of the fries.  I was in the mood for something sweet so I asked my server if they had desserts.  It was on a different menu, looked over it and decided to order the Marshmallow Brownie (to go).  After some time passed, my server came back and stated that they didn't have all the ingredients for the Marshmallow Brownie (poop-lol).  The food was okay, nothing to run back to."}
{"text":"I love this place and can't wait to go back!   Such an interesting menu and everything my group ordered was awesome. It's a bit expensive but I thought it was worth it. I'm a vegetarian and I was very much pleased by the options that I had. I got the vegan chicken gyro and it was delicious! Nice staff and good beer selection, as well."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a sandwich in lakewood!  Everything is always fresh!  My favorite is the Philly steak sandwich and I love dipping my fries in the jammy sauce!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I've really enjoyed Jammy Buggars in the past. We were seated promptly. The complimentary chips were tasty and we enjoyed the perogies appetizer. The Westside sarsparilla wasn't nearly as delicious as it has been previously. My husband's Guiness was a terrible pour. He felt his better bacon burger was very greasy and he only ate half. He did like his poutine fries. I got the shrimp scampi which didn't resemble any shrimp scampi I've had anywhere else. Too much shrimp is a bad thing...there were so many in the dish and it was overwhelming. The cheesy risotto tasted as if it had come from a frozen microwaved meal. I left half my meal behind. I really should make this a 2 star review...but I'll be nice because the perogies were so good."}
{"text":"Aw shucks, I really wanted to love this place.  The name Jammy Buggars is a Brit term for a lucky individual, favored, charmed, blessed, serendipitous.   JB's is an easy walk from my place so I was super excited to make this a regular stop for happy hour or dinner but it just hasn't lived up to my hopes or maybe my dreams.  Stop one was for afternoon drinks and dessert.  The dessert was pretty average and the beers were pretty good -- I was introduced to beer cocktails which I found to be fun.  A mix of two beers is the general way  but there is a Breckenridge Vanilla Porter + Abita Rootbeer that was a fun treat.   We sat in the bar area about 3 on a Saturday and the service was underwhelming especially since things were awfully quiet here.  Thinking my first visit was an off-time of day I stopped by solo one night after work around 5:30 or 6.  I waited at the front for 10 minutes before anyone even offered to seat me ... but then she said she it would be a minute and another 10 passed before she came to seat the couple in front of me.  At this point she disappeared never to be seen again, at least not while I waited but it is true after another 5 passed I left and went up the street for dinner.  Service clearly is an problem, strike 2..  Then on a Saturday afternoon I stopped in for a late lunch and as I stood again at the front waiting to be seated I had an ominous feeling that I it was going to be a repeat of my most recent attempt to dine here.  But I did get seated and decided just to have a beer and their hand-cut fries which I got to pick 3 sauces.  This was a filling and fun fried treat -- my sauce picks: Sriracha mayo, Jammy Buggar sauce and white BBQ.  I enjoyed these and would order them again to have along side a cold beer.  Service was fine.  Not great for sure but not terrible.  Then this past weekend on a Saturday night I walked to Jammy Buggars  with a couple of friends for dinner.  We had planned to go to Deagan's just down the street but one of my friends notes that it is just too loud there to talk so we stopped here.  I had the vegan (but you can add chicken) agel hair pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, olives and artichoke hearts with white wine-vegan pesto sauce.  It was delish!  Lots going on in this dish but it was so full of flavors that kept me interested and made me reconsider all my bad experiences at this local joint.  Then we split an apple bourbon crisp with vanilla ice cream that was fabulous!  So on the food experience today I have to give high marks for my meal which I would easily order again.     My friends enjoyed their meals (one had the linguine with fresh Maine lobster and sweet shrimp with julienned veggies and a basil-white wine butter sauce while the other had the New England Lobster and Shrimp Roll sandwich and side salad) but no one raved about their meal or did the sign of a great meal which is \"you've gotta taste this\".  The service was again pretty poor.  The staff needs some serious training in customer service and developing a good attitude.  For example when we asked her favorite dishes or what she would recommend she said with attitude,  \"it's all fine, it just depends what you like\" .  Uh-huh. Yeah, that would be true but it wasn't what we asked and not a way to endear yourself or to make you feel good about the meal.  Orders were slow to be taken, slow to be served and beverages only refilled if we flagged someone down.   This is a local neighborhood place so I want to see them turn around the attitudes and service of the staff  -- because I still wanna love them.  I'll give it a couple of more tries because I do want to support them but if those aren't better then there are lots of great spots in Lakewood so I'll wave a grace-filled goodbye."}
{"text":"There's one review I can give to a restaurant that invariably satisfies my friends, and I'm glad to say that I always tell my buddies the same thing when they're skimming the menu at Jammy Buggars:   \"If you like the ingredients, you'll like the dish.\"    That's pretty much what Jammy Buggars is; efficient, and good at what it does.  Pretty much any item on the menu, if it looks good, it's gonna be good.  Not fine cuisine, but competently done with high-end ingredients and attention to details. Jammy doesn't shoot as high as some local restaurants, but it does damn good pub grub with a damn fine beer list, and as such I've come here at least six times with different configurations of friends.  All of them have agreed to come back.   If you're a beer fan, well, add half a star t this review.  They have an extensive beer list - not the best in town, but the biggest beer lists are often just compilations of every beer they could get their hands on, good or terrible.  Pretty much every beer on the list here is carefully chosen to appeal to someone, without any real missteps in the bunch.    (Though sadly, they removed the best appetizer - their bread dish had fantastic sauces.  I miss them.)    Jammy Buggars is pretty much pitch-perfect comfort food.  Want to go out for a couple of brews and get a good burger to go with it?  Well, this satisfies in a way in pretty much no other restaurant in town can match.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because Jammy has a narrow range - you gotta want a specific brand of food, or a large number of beers to choose from, or else it can't deliver.  But it's kind of like a hammer - maybe not the best tool for every occasion, but when you need it, there's nothing else that does it quite as well.    Also, you can - and should - order the malt liquor, which comes in a brown bag.  I mean, come on, who doesn't wanna be a bum for a day?"}
{"text":"Well we've been meaning to try this place for quite some time. Plain and simple we got some pretty good flavors from their food, but it's clear that their \"chef\" LOVES to use an over abundance of oils to help make their food taste better. To some, that might not be a big deal. Just think it's kind of an easy way out to create something tasty, and I personally don't like that oily texture stuck to my lips after trying to wipe it off. Their Salmon Sandwich was prob the best thing that we tried in our opinion. It was a decent experience."}
{"text":"I have given this place at least 4 tries and I have never had good food here before - I had the chili once that had a ketchup base !  It was a very traumatic experience for me.  Their fries are a mess.  They are always served in a soggy pile.  They tried to do a truffle pommes frites like Deagan's and it was almost inedible.  Their menu is creative, but hardly anything that I have had tastes good.  Each time I go back I try and get the most boring thing, figuring they couldn't possibly screw it up.  I know the Brits aren't well known for their food, so maybe this is the American version of trying to exemplify it?  They do have a good beer selection though."}
{"text":"The OMG: one of the best burgers I've ever had! I kill my burger (medium well), and it was perfection! Moist, succulent, not burnt... And the Frenchy fries sooo many! And oh so good!  Blues piped in, burgers and beer... Can't get any better!  Unpretentious neighborhood bar feeling. I am home!"}
{"text":"love Love LOVE this place.  I was a little weary of trying this place as soon as it opened. I thought it would be another failed attempt to fill the real estate. I am so glad I gave it a try, and it really seems Lakewood has welcomed this restaurant into the community as a new staple!  The bar area is my favorite place to sit. The bartenders are all so nice and give great service! The draft list is very nice, offering a variety you don't see at your average Lakewood bar. They also have draft root beer which they make a couple beer mixes with. All amazing!   The food is so delicious. I don't have a favorite because I really enjoy trying something different every time. I will say that I have never been disappointed! I would also like to demand everyone try the Jammy Buggar fry sauce. They make it in house, and it is the best dipping sauce! I want to buy some and bring it home....yum!  I would also like to note that most of their food seems very ethically sourced. The owner was telling me that their beef is all grass fed and all their desserts are made in house. It sounds to me like they cook and prepare everything in house and everything tastes very fresh!   Everyone should try this place. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I had the oddest and worst service in my life at Jammy Buggars this Saturday afternoon. I would love to give more stars for the food and the atmosphere and the beer. I should have liked this place! I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try because everything on the menu sounded great. I went with the beer battered fish sandwich and regular fries. I LOVED the fries. I was planning on coming back to try the Mac & Cheese, and the different styles of toppings on the fries...   But the service was horrible! If it was this girl's first day, she should have still had her trainer standing with her. To talk for her. Because she couldn't. It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in a restaurant. Were there specials? I don't think she even told us her name. My friend ordered a chicken hoagie, and she said, \"ok.\" There was silence. I wasn't going to start my order yet, because aren't there some other things to discuss? My friend had to say for herself \"That comes with fries?\" It felt like we were pulling teeth, like we were taking the order for ourselves. It was so odd (and irritating)!   Here's where it gets even more so. I had almost finished my beer and had eaten half of my meal. Unnamed Waitress asks if I would like a box. When she brings it back, I tell her we are stepping outside for a cigarette and will be right back. Two minutes into our standing outside the front window and door, with our backs to our booth, the bus girl comes running outside with my umbrella, telling me I forgot it. I told her I did not, because we haven't left yet. We looked over our shoulders inside to see all our plates and glasses stacked up at the end of the table! She bussed our table, and I hadn't even put my food in the box yet. I wasn't done eating my fries! I wanted to finish my beer! I TOLD THE WAITRESS where we were going!   Want to see it get even more weird? When we got back to our table, the plates and glasses were all spread out again. She UNBUSSED our table!!! Who does that?! Has that ever happened in the history of restaurants ever?! Were we expected to finish our food still?  Any minor problem in my previous dining history has always been resolved sufficiently by the server, so it didn't even occur to me until later that I should have asked for her manager. When I informed our server of the problem, she said she'd go ask the bus girl what happened. I had hope that she was actually talking to her boss. She came back and offered us each a free drink. We took it, and although I felt we deserved a bit more than that, considering half my meal cost more than a drink, I just wanted this horrible service to end.  I have had better service at Denny's. I have had my order taken better at McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is an interesting review to write because the food was 3-star to 4-star worthy, but the customer service was 2-star at best.  I am burger obsessed, to say the least.  I lived at Streat Burger in Lakewood before they closed so everyone told me to try the cheeseburgers at Jammy Buggars.  I happen to like an egg on my burger, which apparently is a very rare request here (even though they have brunch on the weekend), as they said they had never heard of such a thing.  It was not that busy and I said I was more than willing to pay an upcharge, but after checking with the owner, the server said they could not accommodate my request.  I ordered a burger, sans egg, and went about my meal, but really could not figure out why they would be so opposed to my egg suggestion. Being the strong-minded person I am, I had to know why, so I asked the owner.  He says \"it throws off the kilter in the kitchen.\"  Maybe frying an egg is more complicated than I had originally thought, but I am willing to bet that anyone that cooks for a living could probably handle it.  The owner then asked, if I wanted a burger with an egg on it, why I had not looked at their menu before coming to restaurant, to see if there was a burger with an egg offered.  No, I had not planned ahead for this type of situation because who would have thought that an egg would be such an outlandish request?  So if you like cheeseburgers, this may not be your \"jam.\"  They do not seem to be thinking outside the box here.  I know this seems ridiculous to write over an egg, but when there are a hundred places to get a burger in this city, you would think that the owner of a business could fry a 25 cent egg on a Wednesday night for a new, potentially returning, customer. I will not be returning. There are hundreds of places in Lakewood that will accommodate adding things- as simple as an egg to your burger. I'd hate to bring someone with a food allergy in here who actually needs accommodations...."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried their brunch here before. Absolutely excellent. Vegan options as well here. Prices were more than reasonable! Will start doing brunch here more often. Their menu was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars for the burgers, because they are exceptional. I have tried other things on the menu, but nothing has really impressed me. I feel their other dishes tend to be really heavy on the salt. As far as I know, the food quality of the rest of the menu is not locally sourced. The burgers on the other hand, are grass fed, with nice local beef and are totally delicious. I have always had good service experiences here. A nice addition to the restaurants Lakewood has to offer."}
{"text":"Best burgers and fries in the Cleveland area in my opinion. The owner makes his own house grind for the beef patty, vegan burger, chicken patty, and whatever the special of the month is (currently a Reuben burger with the house grind and corned beef mixed in--and bacon kraut and homemade thousand island and a homemade rye bun--maybe my favorite monthly one yet). Buns are perfect, quality ingredients all around, and the fresh cut fries are done to perfection. Get whatever the monthly special burger is and you will never be disappointed. All top 5 of my favorite burgers I've ever had have been one of the specials. Best happy hour in town as well (half priced burgers m-f). I'm done--just go here and get a burger and fries, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a spot I like to go to for dinner with my friends on the weekend. It doesn't fill up like some places do on those busy nights, which is somewhat surprising to me because it is delicious. One of my favorite things about this place is that they serve 40s in a brown paper bag, which seems super hipster but is mainly just awesome if you want to get ka-slammered off of two drinks (I only had one so you can avert that judgemental gaze).   I've gotten a lot of different things here: the Detroit theater burger (my favorite except for the calorie guilt I felt afterwards), a ham sandwich, various other burgers, even a salad (the guilt from the first burger stayed with me for a while). Everything I've had has been fantastic, with the exception of the vegan chicken gyro I got, which I only ordered because I'm apparently blind to the word \"vegan\" and just wanted a chicken gyro. Don't worry, I made up for it by pounding cheese and bacon covered fries and still left full and happy.   My only gripe with this restaurant is that the pressed ham sandwich I got is call the Jammy Hammy Sammy and I was embarrassed as hell to order it because that name is ridiculous. I guess I should have drank another 40 and I wouldn't have cared.   Final verdict: I love this place. I've taken dates here, friends here, and even people I don't like here bc the food made me less annoyed to be around them."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick meal on a cold Saturday afternoon.  I had the patty melt and my husband had the burger that is a knock off of a Big Mac (don't remember the name, sorry!).  Both meals came with fries.  We both enjoyed out meals and the waitress was very attentive during a busy time in the restaurant.  We will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"Apparently my boyfriend and I have very bad luck compared to everyone else that has visited here... We were looking for a place close to home and where we had never been before...we decided to give this place a try. We walked in and waited to be sat... It was pretty busy but seemed to be staffed well. We were asked to wait while they cleaned off a large table in the front window....after they cleaned it off they decided to move us to a much smaller two top jammed up against a wall and between people (which I understood it was busy and they needed the larger table for others) after being sat and handed a little bowl of their house chips... We waited and waited and waited. No one came to take drink order let alone a food order....couldn't get a server to even make eye contact with us so we could ask someone...and trust me we tried to flag someone down....so after 20 minutes of waiting without so much as getting a water or the possibility of a water in the near future we left. So I can't review the food although I would've liked to the menu seemed intriguing, but I can review the service and it was terrible."}
{"text":"Awful hours. They choose when they close and when they stay open with their actual hours. Inconsistent.   Place is terrible. Go to Merry Arts or McGintys or just stay home rather than go to this awful place."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite happy hour spots, period. We always end up with super nice bartenders.  The specials can't be beat. Three dollar craft drafts on a pretty good selection, and half of some damn good burgers. It's never too busy either. Go get day drunk and eat good food, I don't know why more people aren't."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out on a cold winter night & had a difference of opinion. I had the OMG turkey burger with mushrooms and Swiss cheese with jammy buggars sauce with sweet potato waffle fries and I thought the meal was perfect! I wanted another one! The fries were SO great! My boyfriend ordered a shrimp & lobster roll with Mac & Cheese and he was jealous of my food as his was bland (thankful for the dipping sauce) without any flavor. We will return but we know what to order now!"}
{"text":"Based on this past time I went here I'm bumping them up a star. I had an excellent burger and fries (and left my leftovers in the box on the table as usual). And good beer and service. Plus the free chips before hand like I mentioned last time. The burger I got was the Special, don't remember it except it had avacados."}
{"text":"First time here... We were seated immediately which was nice!! I got the \"Better Bacon Burger\" and a Porter beer... I am not sure if I came in on a good day or their fries are always this fresh, hot and crispy. The size of the fries were probably my favorite part. My burger I substituted the bread for lettuce with a side of their Sriracha mayo dip... If not for the sauce it was a dry dry burger... Definitely  going back for more beer & fries for sure!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Jammy Buggars regardless of the fact that I kept calling it Jimmy Boogers, which i suppose is better than Jammy Boogers, but anyway...   We ordered the mushroom bruschetta, which was just ok. there was a high pile of field greens in the middle with no dressing, and I don't particularly care for garnish salad on my plate, but that's just me being picky.  For main course we ordered the pulled pork sandwich, burger (which the waitress assured me is what they want to be famous for), the fish and chips (said waitress told us she shared this with someone once and wanted to kill her food partner so she could have it all to herself)  and the steak salad. All were really top notch. They also have some really great sauces for your fries that I recommend trying out an assortment.   All in all it was a very clean place, very friendly and colorful waitstaff, and I'll definitely try it again..."}
{"text":"I just moved to Lakewood a few months ago and had heard I had to try this place.  I finally went this week with a friend and it was absolutely delicious!   Right when you sit down they give you homemade potato chips with a Cajun seasoning.  I would of been happy sitting there drinking and eating those the whole time.   We ended up getting the fried mozzarella to start and the seasoning on the breading and the pesto sauce they drizzle on top really made it some of the best.  It came in small bite size balls which I liked so they were not too filling.  They also give you a lot them, we probably had half the order left with just two of us.    I ordered The Akron burger and it was cooked exactly how I asked and really flavorful.  It came with fries which you could tell were homemade and not too greasy.  They also offer you a dipping sauce of your choice for your fries and i got the Saracha Mayo which I asked for a lid to take the rest of it home with my leftovers.    My friend got The Ex and added chicken.  It was a really big sandwich but she had said it lacked a little flavor, she ended up using her dipping sauce (Jammy Buggar) she got with her fries on the sandwich and said it made it much better. I would definitely go back, the whole menu seemed delicious!"}
{"text":"40's in a brown paper bag...straight Boyz N the Hood style. I love it!  The staff is friendly here, the menu has a lil something for everyone, and the food is pretty good too. We started with the \"nekkid\" hand cut fries and the crab balls, and both were very good. I usually like \"fries with my ketchup\", but these fries are great on their own. The fries come with sides of dipping sauces, but i wasn't a fan of any of their heavily mayo-based dipping sauces and the bbq sauce was just ok. I didn't have high expectations for the crab balls, but they were lightly crunchy on the outside and surprisingly moist on the inside...on par with what I would expect from an actual seafood restaurant. For our meals, the consensus seemed to be that the burgers were good. I'm not vegan but I had given up meat and poultry at the time of the visit, so I went with the vegan chicken gyro. This has to be the absolute closest anything vegan can get to chicken, but i just couldn't stand the onions...they were explosive, to the point that i just had to pick them off and i'm getting a headache just thinking about them. The vegan tzatziki sauce was good as well. Overall, it was a good experience. Looking forward to getting back to try the burgers."}
{"text":"I asked my husband to find us a good place for lunch on our long road trip home from the east coast. When he found Jammy's he said \"how can we NOT go with a name like that?!\"  Jammy's did not disappoint. Really great local craft beer, creative sandwiches (THE Ex and the Hammy Jammy Sammy pictured here!). Even the kids mac-n-cheese and chicken fingers were fresh and tasty. Top it all off with delectable hand cut fires and you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the choices on the menu were really varied and allowed me to choose exactly what I wanted. I had chosen the Turkey Burger and it really lived up to its reputation. It was delicious. The service was a bit lax, but all-in-all not horrible and they were always friendly. You are supposed to get a dipping sauce of your choice with each burger, unfortunately, our waitress did not mention this so no one received any of this. I had to ask to get mine which felt a bit like an inconvenience to the waitress.  I would recommend this to someone, but I would say make sure they really read the menu to make sure they get everything they are supposed to. But also, just to make sure that they get the dish they really want because of all the amazing options!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 4 star experience, especially because burger are 1/2 price during Happy Hour, from 3-7, yes!!!  A friend and I met here after work on a Wednesday evening.  We were immediately seated.  I had never been to Jammy Buggars before, she had.  I proceeded to order the patty melt, light onion, add mushrooms (yum!) and I also upgraded my french fry order for a couple of bucks.  My friend ordered the March monthly special, reuben burger, and upgraded her fries, as well.   I munched on complimentary chips while we waited for our food.  The food arrived a short time later, and my patty melt was a decent size, bread nicely toasted, couldn't quite taste the added mushrooms, as much as I would have liked, but the sandwich was pretty tasty.  The fries, were good, as well, not sure that I would upgrade the next time, though, a bit goopey for me, white cheddar cheese sauce, bacon bits, and chives, I believe.  My friend enjoyed her food, as well.  Also keep in mind that a turkey burger can be substituted for any of the regular burgers, which I think is a great option. I would absolutely return to Jammy Buggars to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a sandwich... I've had the OMG both as a burger and a grilled chicken breast. Both ways were really good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'm a former employee of 4 1/2 years.  The food is amazing!  Ate there for 4 1/2 years 3 or 4 times a week and never got tired of it.  Jammy Buggars adds new items to the menu on a consistent basis, they use the freshest ingredients and have the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen in the 15 years I've been in the business.  Great beer selection and a comfortable atmosphere.  Love, Love, Love Jammy Buggars!!"}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars is one of my favorite go- to places. There's parking in the back and the waiters greet you with homemade chips. Great but short wine list that includes an oaky Chardonnay. Great menu for vegetarians including a veggie gyro, interesting take on the veggie burger and my favorite dish on the menu- sauerkraut balls! Sauerkraut balls with a dipping sauce that makes me smile just thinking about it.  The ambiance is simple, cozy and welcoming. Another great thing about jammy Buggars is that the owners have give back nights with 10% proceeds going toward local charities one day per week. Go- bring your family or friends and eat at one of the best Restaurants in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I had Sunday brunch with my older children and it was very good! Not just the same old! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great happy hour spot in Lakewood!  Half price burgers M-F 3-6. The burgers are around $12 so during this time they are only about $6.  Happy Hour M-F 3-7. $3 pints of draft beer (including some delicious IPA selections). My favorite was the Flying dog snake dog IPA. $3 well liquor mixed drinks.  As soon as you are seated they bring you delicious homemade chips that have a spectacular seasoning. I had the Remodeled Detroit burger, which is supposed to be similar to a Big Mac, that also came with fries. It was basically just 2 burgers and there was so much food that it could easily be split, making it $3 a person for a meal. Add in a few drinks and you've got yourself a nice meal that doesn't break the bank.  They have a nice big bar and a relaxed atmosphere. We went around 6 and they were still some families, but they started to clear out at the end of happy hour."}
{"text":"BAM! this place is thebomb.com! Vegan options are excellent, and much appreciated. Don't mess this up JB and get rid of them. i cant really point out any stand out excellent points... service was good (and it was her first day!), food was really good, beers were good and not over priced, atmosphere was good. all around good! we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a weekday with a colleague of mine. I had the Detroit Theater burger, because I was particularly hungry and somehow I thought a sandwich constructed from double patties and onion rings would hit the spot. For how heavy this meal sounds, the restaurant does a good job of keeping the portion size reasonable and avoids serving a greasy mess. I give this place four stars because the meal tasted fresh and the burger was cooked the way I wanted it; however, nothing particularly distinguished this place from many other good burger joints I've visited. On that point, I think I might have to try the lobster roll next time."}
{"text":"Was longing for a really good burger and got one of the best I have ever had in Cleveland here! I have always recommended Johnny's Little Bar, but, this one ranks equal in my opinion. Nice atmosphere,  great service too. Everyone who ordered had similarly positive things to say. Fairly priced and not pretentious like some of the trendy so called \"gourmet burger\" joints which keep popping up."}
{"text":"Great taste, humble service and pretty great prices for the portions! $12 for a burger and it's WORTH IT"}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars is a very good standard bar-restuarant in the Lakewood area among many others. They offer great menu items from burgers, to appetizers, to chef inspired sauces and condiments, etc. It is one of the better bar restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"So let me start off. I am a sucker for a good burger and some cheesy fries paired with a good beer, so I may be a little biased.  If I could give a 4.5 I would. There were problems but the good so outweighs the bad.   We sat at the bar good choice number 1. The bar staff was friendly, knowledgeable and fast. We ordered a couple beers first. Their beer list was great, maybe 10 on tap and all great for the season. All were reasonably priced (4-5.50 each). We had the pub n grub. 3 sliders and fires with a pint for 10 dollars good choice number 3. We upgraded the fries to cheesy bacon fries. A little pricey but still pretty good.   The food was yummy. The buns for the sliders had a salt and pepper crust. The sliders were a little over cooked but it's really hard to make grass fed beef taste bad.   Now a word on sauces.I'm usually not a condiment person but Jammy buggar sauce is AMAZING. I wanted to slather my entire meal in that mysterious concoction and I nearly did.  Don't miss: The sliders. Definitely a good meal  Hit or miss: seating can be hard to come by so if you see a bar seat open grab it.  Avoid like the plague: Missing the Jammy Buggars sauce. Just try it. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people rave about this place. Honestly I think it's overrated.  Food wasn't bad, but I would rather head over to George's Kitchen or Merry-Arts Lounge and grab a burger. I had just a regular old bacon, cheese burger. I just wanted to see how they could do that. It was nothing special. My date got the \"smokey burger\". It was a BBQ burger. It had cheddar, BBQ, smoked jalapeño-onion relish and crispy onions. He's response was \"not bad\". I do like the fact that all burgers are made from 100% grass-feed steer from Green Vista farms in Wooster. Pretty dialed. The service was on point until we got our food then it was such a long wait for more drinks. She was super friendly though. The inside of the restaurant was nothing out of the ordinary. Tvs, and table. I will probably try this place out again since so many people rave about it. Sometimes you gotta give a place a second chance."}
{"text":"very good food, just slow at lunch, I recommend the Akron, very nice!. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Thursday nights are the best nights. .25 cent wings with amazing sauces. My favs the west side. They should rename their ranch \"gods jizz\" because it's the best thing in this planet. Can you please bottle it and let me buy some. Also one of my favorite veggie burgers in Cleveland. Staff is always very friendly and they give delicious chips to start off with. I plan on trying more but I can't help but get the wings every time. Will update when I try more. But seriously though. I was serious about the bottled ranch.    Update ::  We come here more often then not and service has been horrible. I can't remember the last time i had a good server or bartender. Always so young. Eating on the line. Ignoring our table. Taking 25 minutes just to put an order in. I've been a server and bartender for 7 years and i think the entire staff is absolutely horrendous except for maybe one red head with glasses we never end up getting. We waited 7 minutes tonight before i finally got up and asked if we even had a server while i watched the entire staff stuffing their faces on the line the whole time we were there. I also watched the food runner talk shit about us to a server because we asked her for napkins and refills on our empty drinks. we also haven't gotten refills the entire time by our server and i was charged for a drink i didn't even get and ranch dressing my boyfriend didn't even ask for. I never tip bad and this girl doesn't even deserve a cent. She didn't even do anything.   One time we asked what the flavor of the month was and we were told a salt and vinegar rub and it came out pure mayo sauce and we didn't even touch any of them and they still charged us for them.    We love the food. It's great 9 times out of 10. But the service needs insane work and it's getting to the point we don't even want to come here anymore."}
{"text":"We used to be regular patrons, and even have the \"your dad's beer\" T-shirt, however, after our most recent visit we will never be back. The waiter seemed in a rush, and bothered that we were there even though it was an hour and a half before closing. We ordered food and two beers. Both of our draft beers were clearly incorrect or not at all what we ordered. They both sat untouched at the table, however, the waiter never bothered to come around and ask if there was an issue, or to see how the food was. After we finished eating, the busser came to clear the table and asked how things were. I told her that quite honestly everything was subpar. As regular guests, this was the worst the food had ever been (cold and dried out), and both drinks were wrong. Her response was to literally laugh. I said \"no, I'm not kidding\" and her response was \"oh OK\" then dropped the check and walked away. After all of this, we left a 10 percent tip. Lo and behold, when we went to check the credit card statement, the tip had been changed from three dollars to five dollars. So, crappy food, crappy service, and credit card fraud equals two people who will never return."}
{"text":"I really like this place. There aren't too many spots in Cleveland that have nailed the middle-of-the-road gastropub thing and I think Jammy Buggar's has done it. In a nutshell when you come to this place you're sure to get good food that won't have you taking out a second mortgage on your already worthless home that's paired with a beer list that'll keep most brew geeks comfortably and happily inebriated.  We sat at the bar during our visit and couldn't have been happier with the level of service. Our bartender was genuinely friendly with just the right amount of attention. If there's one thing that can turn me off immediately it's an overly attentive waitstaff. It's nice to see when someone gets it right.  The beer list here is a strong B with 20 rotating taps and 50 or so bottled selections. Some of the standout draught selections on the day of our visit were Great Lakes Rally Drum Red (essentially an IPA dressed as an amber ale) and Breckenridge 471 (one of my favorite imperial IPAs). The draught list features a well-balanced mix of local, regional and big box beers and the bottles list packs some of its own surprises - Thirsty Dog Cerberus Belgian Tripel and Mickey's malt liquor served in a brown paper bag for those nights you feel like slumming it.  We went the sandwich route on our first visit:  The Susan Flipping the Bird - This is their Susan sandwich (tomato, avocado, buffalo mozzarella, roasted garlic pesto on focaccia) with, what else, chicken (+$3). All sandwiches come with house-cut fries but my wife opted for the coleslaw. The sandwich was perfect. Soft focaccia, crispy fresh veggies, soft melty cheese and tender juicy chicken. As a self-professed slaw snob I rarely find slaw that I like. JB's nailed it. Creamy, sweet, mayo-based (as it should be) and simple.   The Almost Downtown Chicken Hogie - I think I could eat this sandwich every day. A soft and crispy hogie roll packed with grilled chicken, provolone cheese, so-thick-you'll-smack-your-mamma bacon, fried onions, and garlic aioli. In a vain attempt to make this meal seem a tad healthier (I said vain, didn't I?), I opted for the sweet potato waffle fries. The fries were great and the honey mustard dipping sauce was a nice surprise.  The dessert that I forgot - We also had a dessert of some kind, something like a cinnamon roll thing with nuts and ice cream maybe some apples...unfortunately, I waited too long to write this thing so I don't remember exactly what it was. Suffice it to say, it was good.  Jammy Buggar's is a welcome addition to the Cleveland dining scene. They really fill a space that's been dominated far too long by mega-corporate chains that serve processed psuedofoods - budget friendly tasty food minus the frills. Its unpretentious take n gastropub fare along with a generous craft-brew heavy beer list will make them a regular on my to-eat list."}
{"text":"Wing night is pretty good and I like the 40oz options... I like the over all atmosphere there but out of the two bars on that strip I'd take the latter of the two.."}
{"text":"Great food! The malt vinegar mayo and garlic mayo are awesome! Lots to choose from food wise and beer wise."}
{"text":"Smokey burger was delicious! Fries were fresh and tasty. Not a fan of the garlic mayo dipping sauce though. Had falafel balls as an app. You MUST try! Yum! Service was great, loved our server."}
{"text":"Great place for some good American food. They have a really great happy hour. Til 7pm drafts are $3. They have a great selection! Also on week days until 6pm they have half price burgers. This is really a good deal, as they come with fries too.  Thursday night is wing night. $0.25 wings with the purchase of a beverage. It is a great deal! They have 6 or 7 flavors to choose from including a special flavor of the month. Last time I was there, it was black pepper bourbon.  Parking could be a problem on a busy night but typically street parking or the lot behind the place is available."}
{"text":"We love Jammy Buggars!  We are not frequent reviewers.  We only write a review if we love or hate a place.  This is one of our go to spots.  Veg and meat friendly, which works for my husband and I and a great kids menu for our girls.  Their brunch is our Sunday morning \"thing.\"  My husband waits all week for Sunday Jammy Buggars.  That being said, they just changed the menu and we're not total fans of the changes.  Yes, I know you can't please everyone and you have to do what's best for the bottom line, but sometimes getting some feedback helps too...right?  Missing the kids menu for brunch and the omelettes!!  The skillets are good in theory, but weren't as good as we were hoping.  Your breakfast potatoes?  Straight from heaven.  The best potatoes on the planet.  So, again, thank you for those.  But, you seriously had some of the best french toast on the planet too and you took it off the menu!!  Oh yeah, and your benedict, especially the Garden Benny, is ahhhmazing.  We love you guys.  Love your dinner menu.  Just wanted to add our two cents for brunch, because current menu we may have to find a new Sunday spot.  :("}
{"text":"Service was good. Reasonable prices. Appetizer ordered was swedish meatballs w/ fresh bread were absolutely delicious. I ordered the salmon blt. Salmon was cooked to perfect medium. It was flavorful. Fries were fresh & tasty. Boyfriend ordered a burger. He said it was great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars WAS my favorite cheeseburger in CLE, but NOT anymore.  I am so disappointed with the new menu.  1st- they have removed the hot pretzel sticks and 2nd all of the cheeseburgers have changed. I really didn't mind paying $$$ for a local beef burger, but they missed the mark last night.  My med. burger was beige inside and the service was subpar.  She didn't even offer us a dessert menu.  I'm moving on and not going back."}
{"text":"So this place is very nice and the food is just plain delicious. I honestly can't complain about a thing.  The first thing I have to say is that the complimentary chips they bring out are amazing. You know how when many restaurants and bars make in house chips and they all feel and taste overdone with minimal flavor? We'll get rid of that notion. Not at Jammy Buggars.  The burgers my wife and I got were juicy as juicy gets and packed with so much flavor that they must've been using professional flavor packers in the kitchen. My cousin had a Mac and cheese.... mmmm.... we all loved her Mac and cheese....  Good job Jammy. You little Buggars you..."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Good service good food and the drinks are wonderful. The food is so good that I fall in love I had the Alabama steak sandwich and my partner had red neck fries it was sausage home cook white gravy. Good I just couldn't find anything I didn't like about this place. We will be back"}
{"text":"Happy Hour, 3-7pm,  1/2 priced burgers, $1 off drafts, $3 well drinks and buy two glasses of wine, get the rest of the bottle free. Need I say anymore to get you to go? Jammy Buggar's is a really cute bar in the heart of Lakewood and from the moment you step inside, it's very cozy. The staff is very accommodating. We brought a large group of about 15 people and ordered our burgers after 7pm, not realizing that the deal ended then, yet they were gracious enough to still give us the  1/2 off deal. We sat in the private room that's to the left when you walk in. You can reserve the space at no cost and they are willing to setup the room any way you'd like. The only negative about this place is that the ceilings are very high and for whatever reason, the noise bounces off the walls and it's very hard to hear each other. Regardless, they have a great beer selection and their burgers and fries are delicious."}
{"text":"I keep a \"bucket list\" of Cleveland restaurants I want to try and Jammy Buggars has basically thrown a wrench in that.  Now, instead of wanting to go to new restaurants, I just want to keep coming back to Jammy Buggars.  I ordered one of their delicious burgers and had it custom with bleu cheese and bacon.  This combination was so flavorful that I got to really savor and enjoy the juiciness of the burger.  The fries were also incredible!  They were a thick cut fry, which I normally am not the biggest fan of.  I ordered the \"frenchy\" fries that were topped with truffle oil, parmesan, and chives.  They were heavenly!  Their menu also includes several fry variations like \"redneck poutine\" which I'm dying to go back and try.  I also was happy to see the definition of a \"jammy buggar\" on this Yelp page, because we were definitely curious and had a lively discussion on the origins of the name-- \"a kid who can't say burger?\", \"someone's last name is buggar?\" :)"}
{"text":"Four of us thought we'd try out Jammy Buggars for supper last Thursday before heading over to 16 Bit. We checked their website for a menu and found it to be very eclectic which was perfect for us. It happened to be \"wing night\" which was a plus for two of us. We had to wait about a 1/2 hour for a table but it was no problem. We each grabbed a beer and found a place on the couch. Once we got a table, we tried out a couple selections from the \"Got Balls\" section of the menu (Crispy Crab Balls & Sauerkraut Balls). I can tell you that I'm not a kraut eater but these were awesome! We tried a couple order of wings, a turkey burger, a seasonal salad, sweet potato waffle fries, and a burger of the month which was of course, Irish.) The food was delish, the server was very helpful and fun. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food, and they are happy to customize for dietary needs, which is a must for me! The veggie banh-mi burger is one of the BEST veggie patties I've had, and I've had them everywhere in town. Only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of 5 is that they never seem to have much of a crowd compared to surrounding taverns (which is something I look for), and 2 of my 3 other family members had a hard time picking a dish that sounded good to them (although they were decently satisfied with their selections anyway)."}
{"text":"Jammy's is a wonderful local eatery, watering hole, hang out, fun place. I love those seasoned cheesey potato chips they give you as you sit at the bar. Great rotating bar menu, awesome special burgers of the month... though I still love the OMG Burger! Love the specialty fries!!! Shout outs to Jim, Gary, and Genna! Get in there and throw money. Craft beer o Rama. If you like $3 craft beer... go in on Tuesday nights! Also one of the best Sunday Brunches in Cleveland. O.o now you know..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Just went there for the first time and will definitely be back.  Food was awesome and a great beer list! I had the Szechwan meatball sub with garlic mayo dipping sauce for the fries and my husband had the fish and chips. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place today and I will definitely be back! The waitress was pleasant, the prices reasonable, the decor stylish but inviting, and the food very tasty! We were sat at a booth right away and immediately brought what I think were homemade potato chips that were crunchy and slightly spicy. We both ordered the same sandwich off of the monthly menu: fried chicken with sweet potato slaw and white BBQ sauce. This came with fresh hot french fries and what I think where homemade pickles. (I forgot to ask what was made in house, but they definitely appeared to be). Since we both love cheese we also got a side of the white cheddar sauce to dip our fires in; let me just say mmm. I also want to note that the portions were large so we both took half of our meals home, which I am very glad about since I will be reheating that tasty meal right after I finish writing this."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the wing night after hearing great things about this place and of course checking Yelp. I really wanted to like this place but sadly, I barely enjoyed the food at all.  If you like naked wings without sauce then this is the place for you.   The butter garlic was like fried chicken and had no sauce - i do not recommend.  The buffalo wings had no sauce either - we had to ask for hot sauce to fix it.  Peanut butter and jelly wings weren't good either. Mac and cheese had No flavor. Barbecue wings were the only decent thing i had.   We also additionally decided to take a burger to go.... based off of yelp photos we went with the Detroit Burger. That was supposed to include two patties and be a large burger.  Instead because it was a to-go order they decided to reassemble it as being two very small burgers. We were not happy about that.  The only thing this place had going for it was the incredible waitress we had. Forgot her name but she was very nice and kind. She had blonde hair with french braids. Her service was amazing.  She is the only reason why i am giving 2 stars instead of 1"}
{"text":"Bartender Pat is at it again!!! I said I'd come back, and the service here made me a man of my word. I sat at the bar this time and got a breakfast burrito, suggested by the aforementioned bartender. YUM!!!! You should have no reserves taking this guys advice on food. Not to mention the service was fast and he made comfortable PC, kid friendly jokes (important this day and age). So will I be back??? Ummm if you're seriously asking me, then re-read my review."}
{"text":"Ignore the name jammy buggers, as some people have told me they haven't tried it due to that. Those fools do not know what they are missing. This wonderful restaurant housed in what was the former NIkos (as well as a number of other places i cannot recall?), is here to stay. I am pleased. I love the food. The fries rock and i would buy the garlic mayo dipping sauce in large quanities if i could. They always give me extra to take home with my leftovers & there are always leftovers! I love the ex with bacon, the lobster rolls & the burgers. The prices are higher, but this ain't mickey d's. If that is what you want they are down the street. Given a choice between here and Deagans, jammy buggers will win everytime, hands down."}
{"text":"Best fries in Cleveland, hands down! Great happy hour for burgers, as well! Liked there old menu better, but whatever!"}
{"text":"25 cent wing night on Thursdays is definitely the cheapest wing night around! The wings are decent sized- not jumbo but definitely bigger and fresher than the garbage at BW3s. The bbq were basically ketchup and brown sugar, but the west side, Cajun butter, jerk-dry rubbed, and bourbon peach were pretty awesome.  Not a lot of other choices as far as sauce goes but I would recommend the jerk dry rub! So crispy and well seasoned. The place is great for families to drinking friends. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I find it to be just okay. The first time I had a basic cheeseburger. I wasn't a huge fan. I wouldn't order it again. The second time I went I had the pesto chicken hoagie. It was way better than the burger. The fries are alright but nothing to write home about. It is nice that you can choose from a selection of fry dipping sauces though. My boyfriend got the Detroit Theatre burger when we went. He said it was okay, but nothing special. We both enjoyed the buffalo mozzarella balls at least. I would rather give this place a three star review instead of four, but I don't think that's fair. There wasn't anything wrong with our food and it wasn't bad. I think more than anything, this place just isn't our cup of tea."}
{"text":"We've eaten and drank here several times, and it never disappoints. Really good food. The Swedish Meatballs and Beef Stroganoff are spot on authentic and absolutely delicious. The service is always friendly and great as well. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Love Thursday night wings special! Draft and we'll drink specials. We'll be back! Great wing flavors!"}
{"text":"They got me! I have been to Jammy's for happy hour many times with my adult friends. They have amazing mozzarella balls and drink specials. We decide to bring our kids for the \"kids eat free Mondays\". The food was not the best. My loaded fries had cold cheese sauce on them, the vegan Mac n cheese had to be sent back - it was oily and had no flavor, the veggie burger fell apart when I picked it up. The service was kind and the place is clean. I have had many meat eating friends rave about the food but for the veg heads, I recommend going for Forage or Deagan's. But stop at Jammy's for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Great burgers, recommend getting dipping sauces for fries. Beer selection is varied and offers many options on draft. Service can be a bit slow, but staff is attentive with refilling drinks."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience our 1st visit here.  Service was spot on.   Went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty busy.   I had the Detroit burger which they say is like their version of a Big Mac.   I would not agree on it even being slightly like a Big Mac in taste, but it is still good on its own.  It has 2 onion rings on it that I ate separate and I thought were quite tasty as far s onion rings go.  I'm not generally a fan of O.R, but these were really good!   I also love the fact the beef is grass fed and from a farm in Wooster!    Someone in my group got the \"EX\" sandwich and they loved it.  Someone else got the steak sandwich and they were impressed w/the hunks of beef instead of just shaved meat.   The fries are fat and good as they get.  U get to pick a sauce and I tried 3.  The jammy buggar sauce is best, the bbq was ok and I was not a fan of the garlic mayo which is the one I wanted to like the most.    Will be back for more local beef!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time on a recommendation from a friend and LOVED it.   My boyfriend and I split the burger with onion rings on it with fries and the malt vinegar mayo dipping sauce. It filled both of us up and was one of the best burgers I've had.   We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly and attentive, as were all other employees we encountered.  I can't wait to go back, everything else on the menu looks spectacular!!"}
{"text":"i can not get enough jammy buggars. i would eat here a couple times a week. seriously. the food is THAT yummy. everything is fresh.  menu is great! so many choices and they never disappoint. ever.  the barbecue chips that you receive upon seating are delightful. (bowl could be bigger :)  but a nice touch, especially when you are hangry. the fry sauces. oh my word. so many choices. i love having a variety to dip my fresh cut fries in. yes. i always order at least two, usually 3 to dip!  burgers~amazing. salads~great! (i dont even like rabbit food, but theirs was good!) my favorite is the lobster roll. huge. shrimp. lobster. lemony sauce. need i say more.  i usually get it every time i go.  cute little bar. great beer choices.  jammy buggars, you have my vote. i will keep coming back because you are THAT good!"}
{"text":"As I drove down Detroit yesterday, I noticed some action in the old Niko's storefront.  It turns out a new restaurant has opened - Jammy Buggars.  I was reminded of the Family Guy episode where Peter rattles off a bunch of canceled Fox shows.  In this case, I was thinking \"Well good for them - that's a great location with a lot of history!  Niko's, Bar 2, Niko's, Route 6, Niko's...\"  I was actually excited to try the latest incarnation in this classic Lakewood venue, so we decided to try Jimmy Baggers for dinner.  When we arrived at Sammy Hagars, we were first greeted at the door by two excited guests seated by the window who were raving about how the food was the best they had ever tasted.  Though caught a bit off guard, I figured that was a nice omen. We took a seat in the same booth we sat in when we tried Niko's last time, which felt suspiciously like the booth we sat in when we tried Route 6 a couple years back...    The atmosphere hasn't changed much; It is simple, yet refined - contemporary yet classy.  If I had one suggestion it would be to turn up the music or turn down the lights - it's too clean and quiet to be a bar, but too bright and sterile to create the ambiance you would want for a romantic dinner.  Given the menu, I'm assuming the goal was to create a high-end gastropub kind of experience.  The menu is a good read; they offer all the traditional American pub fare with some interesting concepts and ingredients, along with a few house specialty entrees.  Comparisons to 56 West and Beer Engine aren't out of line - fundamentally, the restaurants are similar, sort of how Franklin sneakers are similar to Reebok Pumps or the 2011 Indians are similar to the 1991 Atlanta Braves.  But unlike those baseball teams, I didn't find much to get excited about when it came to game time.   The OMG burger (Swiss, mushrooms, onions) was gristly, underseasoned, and unevenly cooked.  The Pulled Pork Sliders were interesting, though I was underwhelmed by the potency of the pickled peppers and pineapple.  We also tried the \"Frenchy\" Fries (truffle oil, parmesan, parsley, garlic mayo).  I'm not going to comment on the French fries themselves, because I am beginning to think I might have too high of standards for this American staple, but I will say that the garlic mayo tasted like honey mustard and the chipotle ketchup tasted like French dressing.  Also, the signature chips they serve with the sandwiches could have been crispier and fresher.  Overall, the service was good and the owner/manager stopped by our table to greet us.  I would say the food was mediocre at best, and a bit pricey for the quality.  I guess I would consider giving Bruegger's Bagels another shot in the future just to see how things shake out - I mean, they did just open yesterday.  But before I go back, I would probably want to make another run at The Rocky River Brewing Company, 56 West, Beer Engine, The Pub, Pacers, Deagans..."}
{"text":"More restaurants around town feature an eclectic beer list and Jammy Buggars is no exception. We ended up drinking Breckenridge Vanilla Porter mixed with Zombie Killer Cyser Mead - quite tasty.   I'm still not that jazzed about the food, I had a Hawaiian pulled pork sandwich that contained pineapple bits and hot pepper rings. Not workin'.   However two people at our table had the Braised Beef Short Ribs and they were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Two words...Wing Night!! On Thursdays and Sundays for $0.39 a wing!! Great flavors selection! Great waitresses! Great beer selection! I've gone to Wing Night once a week in 14 of 17 weeks so far this 2018!"}
{"text":"It was my wife & I first time at Jammy Buggar and the food was pretty good. We both got turkey burgers and enjoyed it. The portion sizes are extremely big and the staff was friendly. I would visit Jammy's again!"}
{"text":"Average food with typical pricing.  Not a great amount of selection for food but beer menu solid.  Was there Sat at 6:30 and not busy at all, which surprised me.  Waiter lacked a fun side just all business.  Ok food but decent service."}
{"text":"Come here for the best wing night ever! Thursdays only for 25 cent wings! All you have to do is purchase a beverage.  Make sure you try my favorite, Sriracha Lime Butter."}
{"text":"Best burger place in lakewood, by far! This place has amazing burgers and the sauces make it.. Definitely order at least two different types of sauces. I dont think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"First impression: Came in for Sunday brunch with my family. It was busy, but not packed, so we were seated right away. Server came fairly quick to take drink orders, however it did take a while for her to come back to take our main orders and the wait from ordering and receiving our food was longer than anticipated. I think there is one cool in the back as it took about 40 minutes for 2 orders of eggs Benedict, and order of the skillet and a sausage sandwich to arrive. Overall, the food was great. Tasked lovely. The only complaint is the English muffin that came with the eggs Benedict was rock solid, on both orders. The sausage sandwich was nice. I wish the service was a bit faster, especially since the group of servers at times had nothing to do, but otherwise, the favors were on point."}
{"text":"I don't understand this place and why people like it so much. We've been there three times now and each time is completely unlike the last. The first time we the service was great but food so/so, the next time the service and food tasted good and I felt like it was worth it.   Todays visit, the service was slow, my vegan Mac and cheese came out cold and even after they heated it up, tasted bad. Texture, consistency, and temperature were all off. My vegan gyro was over cooked and dried and my wife's veggie burger was mushy. If you are vegan or vegetarian look elsewhere as its expensive even with the free kids night our 2 dishes came to $28.   Having said that our kids liked there grilled cheese and fries but if think you would be hard pressed to mess that up.   We decided on the way out we won't be back."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  All kids working here that could give 2 shits about anything.  More concerned with checking their phones.  Still have Alberta Clipper on...in May.  Food literally tastes like cardboard and when you bring it up to the server they give you an attitude about it.  Read the newest reviews.  I'm not alone in feeling this.  I used to be this places biggest cheerleader now it will be another O'Tooles.  The writing is on the wall.  Going the way of the Dodo bird..."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place since i moved to lakewood, i shouldn't have!! This place its trying to hard to be an upscale restaurant instead of the dive bar that really is.  The menu is nothing different than the rest of the places surrounding it; wings, burgers, and sandwiches, but they charge you extra for the fancy name i guess. Anyway, I ordered a burger, which was well cooked, but for $14 dollars, it wasn't worth it. It came with a piece of  wilted lettuce,  two slices of cucumber and soggy fries. Next time i'll go straight to merry arts right next door, cheaper drinks and better food. I wont spend my money here again.  Sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We each had an order of wings which were on special for .25 cents each. The sauces were good but the wings were a bit too big for our liking. We also order some loaded fries which were very good. The say they are fries for two but really you could feed 4 people with the amount they serve. Overall the service was very good and the bartender was very friendly. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Unbelievable selection of beers, including some old favorites, and great food. The service is even better as the owners are usually on site. It's a must stop anytime I'm near Lakewood."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and had the mind-blowing vegan chicken gyro. I was pretty sure I was never going to be able to enjoy tzatziki again, but Jammy Buggars gave me that privilege. The gyro was delish and came with perfect hand-cut fries.   This place has a great beer list and awesome happy hour specials. There was no wait at around 6 when we got there and the food and drinks came out in reasonable time. I will definitely be back here when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good music, food and an excellent value.   Thursdays 25 cent wings are a bargain, and they aren't stingy -- nice carrots, celery and even complimentary house made BBQ chips. Domestic beers were only $2 too. Wish the garlic parm wings were in butter instead of dry.   I believe the rest of menu recently had a price hike which puts it up closer in price to Melt, but still much less expensive than Deagans."}
{"text":"Visited Jammy Buggars for lunch today with my family! It is a great little spot in Lakewood. I got the Susan \"Ex-Wife\" and added chicken! It was a great sandwich with tomato, avocado, fresh mozzarella, and pesto on a toasted roll. It is also served with 1/2 inch thick fries which were so fresh and the perfect crispness. They make their own pickles in house and they were really good. The vibe of the restaurant is very casual and chill. You can even write with chalk on their chalkboard wall. The service was excellent. We never once had to ask for a refill on anything. We went on a Sunday so metered parking was free behind the building. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"We have taken friends here a few times, along with our infant daughter. I craved their mushroom bisque for months when I was pregnant and they made it once and never again. I know because I called twice a week... We took friends again in March and low and behold, they had the mushroom bisque. It was as good as I remember, if not better. Mouth Heaven! Our friends are foodies and they really enjoyed it. 3 of us got the pretzel crusted fish n chips (if you read my posts, I'm a BIG fish n chips fan) and the other got the chicken with mozz and tomato and basil I think. Everyone loved their meal and the drinkers enjoyed the myriad of beers.  It gets a little noisy, but nothing I would call extreme. The wait staff is always courteous and even though we had to wait (Saturday night...) there was a comfy couch in the next room and we sat and looked over the menu and prepared ourselves. We had a really great time. Definitely check this place out. Right on Detroit Ave (where the old Niko's was on Detroit, if you're a native) then you can always pop on over to the Merry Arts to finish the night :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I come here I always get the same thing; the Vegetarian Bahn Mi burger with goat cheese with a side of mac n cheese instead of fries. The Bahn Mi comes with a side of sriracha mayo, and some pickle chips. I love the pickles here! So good. I'm sad though that they changed the menu and now instead of the Bahn Mi they have a house veggie burger that's got truffle in it and also comes with a truffle aioli and havarti. It isn't bad, but it's just not as good as the Bahn Mi. The mac n cheese is delicious! Though it varies sometimes as to how cheesy it is. Sometimes when I get it it's kind of dry like it's been leftover, and other times its very creamy and cheesy. Still good though. I nearly always come in between 1-5 in the afternoon. During that time it's usually pretty slow and the service is always great. There is a server named Riley and she's always terrific! The only time service was bad for me was one night I went in with a friend and we were seated and then promptly forgotten. We sat for 20 minutes watching servers walk by us, and I even tried to catch their eye but to no avail. So we just left. I still go though! I've had enough good experiences here that one bad one won't change my view of the place.   Also, try the crispy crab balls."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went the evening before Valentine's day to beat the crowds which we were sure we would encounter had we gone out the actual holiday. To our surprise, on a 6:30pm on a Saturday night, there was no wait at all. Awesome! We had both previously been here before and were in the mood for the food again. Almost immediately after we were seated, a young female came and brought us complimentary chips. Delicious.  Our waitress, Haley, came by and asked for our drink orders which were just a Dr. Pepper and Blue Moon. We placed an order of the nekkid fries with garlic and jammy buggar dipping sauces. The fries arrived very quickly and were hot and fresh. Hands down, I think this place has the best fries in town.  I ordered the turkey burger with a salad instead of fries. For the $2 up charge on the salad, it could've been a little big more substantial. I had asked for no tomatoes and extra croutons, Who would've thought that 4 croutons was extra. She must've forgotten or didn't care to put it in. My fiancee got the pulled pork. Both of us didn't eat much because our beginning fries were so filling. We also didn't have drinks refilled, expect for water.    My one negative comment is the wait staff and their attention to patrons. Haley, though nice, did not come to our table more than three times. We waited 20 minutes for refills. And it was only pop. We didn't even order another beer. Didn't want to start eating until we had a drink with the meal.  A young girl came around with water once, but not our actual waitress. Mind you, it wasn't that busy. I find that a little off putting. A girl looked in our direction, and I starred at her, thinking she'd come over but she just walked away.  Overall, I really like Jammy Buggars. We don't get to the west side often, but really enjoy this place. Make sure you try the fries and the various sauces."}
{"text":"Bleagh. After a visit or two more, this place has become one of the last restaurants I'll pick in Lakewood. The food is rather overpriced, all burgers undercooked, and waaay too many little children for it to be any kind of place you want to grab a drink in."}
{"text":"Fun and different gastro pub in the Lakewood neighborhood. The harvest salad was a fresh and healthy choice to balance out my pumpkin spice martini.  Loved the proscutto and fresh cheese on the salad. Fiend had the angel hair pasta with fresh baby artichoke.  Impressive looking."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional experience at Jammy Buggars! The service was fabulous, but more importantly the food was kick-a$$! I had the chicken gyro (subbed chicken for the gardein option) and my husband had a chicken parm burger and many tasty beers. We loved every aspect and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went to Jammy Buggars last Friday for a double date night and everyone really enjoyed their meal! Everything on the menu sounded really appetizing and we all had a tough time deciding. We started with the pierogies which were phenomenal!! My favorite part of the meal, for sure. They were filled with sweet potato and goat cheese, a must order! I had a simple cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection.  I highly recommend ordering one or two of their dipping sauces on the side! I love the garlic mayo, but they all sounded pretty good. The only real downside was that service was so slow even though they weren't all that busy. They also didn't have a few of the beers that we tried to order that night. It's a cute local burger spot in Lakewood though and worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food was great!! We were referred here by a local lady while in CVS. She was right!"}
{"text":"Halfway through our first visit to Jammy Buggars, I wondered, \"Why didn't I try this sooner?\" The answer, which quickly dawned on me, was that this establishment got off to a bit of a rough start on Yelp, probably courtesy of some well-meaning friends of the owner. I should really learn to forgive and forget sooner, because it's a pretty great place. I had always thought of it as another burger-and-beer joint, so I was surprised when my vegan brother-in-law suggested it on a night out. Not only is the food really respectable, they cater to all dietary stripes. Said BIL had a tasty vegan \"chicken\" gyro, my husband had a nice fatty burger, and I had the beet salad and a bowl of the bright, flavorful sweet potato soup. I should also mention my SIL's lovely \"Frenchy\" fries, generously sprinkled with truffle oil and Parmesan. Pretty sure I'd make a return visit just for a plate of those."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambience. The menu is smaller, but fantastic! You are served homemade bbq chips and an extensive beer list. The sandwiches were both fantastic and the fry sauces great. Service was ok--only thing missed a five star. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very dissappointing. Heard great things- experienced mediocre on most levels including atmosphete, service, and even the food- which i was told would make up for it. I ll leave it at that as i dont want to diss them too much. Likely wont return. But i hope they improve and succeed truly i do!"}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars is one of my favorite places in Lakewood to grab a bite.  Every time I go, I always go for the Ex sandwich, which is the best Caprese ever. Avocado, pesto - yum! I'm not a burger person - but all of my friends love them.  The Salmon Po'Boy is worth checking out as well."}
{"text":"Felt too rude to give them 3 stars. This place is just super average. Overpriced in my opinion, food is good but doesn't really blow your mind. I do like that the meal comes with chips on the table from the minute you sit down. Also they have trivia night once a week which is sometimes fun. It's not the best but worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Lakewood. Whether you're looking for dinner before a night out or just to sit at the bar sipping a beer and watching the big game, this place caters to everyone. The food is top notch and a bargain. Their \"Detroit Theater\" burger, besides being a clever name and an ode to all the is holy in Lakewood, is absolutely delicious. The beer selection is not only fantastic in variety, but changes regularly and seasonally. When asked for places to try in Lakewood, I constantly send people there way and Jammy Buggars has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Crazy drink selection! They serve MALT LIQUOR! REALLY? LOL But the food was great! Their home made chips are really good. You get them when you are seated. Went for a late lunch so a great time. It wasn't crowded at all. The waitress was very nice and she was very knowledgeable of the menu items. Went with the Jamba Shrimp Roll. Enough for 2 people! The handcut fries were really good! Upgraded for the parm cheese and truffle on the fries! Will try a burger next time!"}
{"text":"First time at Jammy's.  Great service and great food. Sauerkraut balls were made in-house and very tasty. Burgers are huge and cooked perfectly.   Try it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. So different with a very distinct menu I can't get enough of. They have a fry selection! Pizza fries, truffle, loaded, frenchy, with sauces to choose from as well! Garlic, malt vinegar, bbq, a house sauce...a perfect starter for two!  \"The ex\" is my favorite sandwich. Tomato and mozzarella is an excellent combination to begin with, but then paired with a garlic pesto on a ciabatta roll, AMAZING. I'm not much for avocado so I leave that off. I'm sure if you are an avocado advocate, it can only improve this delicious sandwich.  The home made potato chips you are served as a bread substitute have a delightful Cajun taste. Chips and a great beer selection, what better way is there to start off a meal?!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun and festive with cute, nice waitresses. The menu is very interesting and I could hardly decide. The waitress recommended the pulled pork, and to say the least, I was a little disappointed. It tasted like any old pulled pork sandwich, and for the price of it, it should've blown my mind (I think). My salad/salad dressing was tasty, and my boyfriend enjoyed his fish n chips, so we'll definitely be back so I can try something else and give it another shot."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since this place opened. I've got a history with the menu which is now pared down to some simple, but great selections. I'd rather a place have 10 choices that are all good and consistent rather than 50 that are misses. JB goes for the former and that's a good thing.  Now let's talk about the fries. They may not be healthy, but they are killer. Best fries in Cleveland, hands down.  I also want to acknowledge the bartender Jim. Probably the best and most attentive bartender I've seen in years. He takes service seriously. No chatty BS with other staff. He stays focused on the patrons and nobody is ever looking for a drink. The guy is so spot on you'd think he owns the place. Heck, maybe he does?   Anyway, I highly recommend this place for a brew and burger. It's clean and affordable. Great service!"}
{"text":"OMG yum. One of the best burgers I ever had. I ordered the smokey and could not put it down. The meat is ground in house and the burgers are made up of 3 kinds of meat. If you are in Lakewood and have not checked this place out, it is a must.   On Sunday's they have a \"Father's Beer Cooler\" list (it's also Monday's 4-close) where all day the beers are only $1.50....and it's a good list! Happy hour is half priced burgers 3-6 and drink specials 3-7 (I think during the week?).   By watching all the employees during my visit, you can tell they all help each other out and work as a team....not every man for himself.   I think the fries could've been cooked a little longer, but I am so not opposed to making this a regular stop..!!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting to love Jammy Buggars more than I do. I have been 3 times and each time the food was good, but I can never remember it after I leave.  The first time I came was for brunch and I definitely remember that experience as the best of the three, but maybe that's just because of my love for brunch and a good breakfast burrito.  The other two times i visited were both for dinner. One time I believe I ordered Mac and cheese and the other I ordered a burger. Both meals were good, but as I said, not enough to stand out in my mind.  The most recent time I visited, my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich, which I was so excited to try. I do have to say it was delicious, but a little underwhelming. When i hear chicken and waffles, I picture nice, big, fluffy waffles and that was not the case here. We laughed as the waitress set it down because it was literally two eggo waffles as \"bread\". Tasty, but not what we expected.  Overall, I don't mind coming here to try new things, but it will never be my first choice."}
{"text":"My Happy Cow  App found Jammy Buggars so we went.  Had to pay a meter and walk but not far.  We were greeted the moment we walked in.  The waitress brought over some fresh made bbq chips and water.  I ask if there was any vegan options and she pointed to the menu that clearly offered a vegan chick'n Gyro and told me how to make the vegetarian burger vegan if I wish.  She was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  She came back after awhile to check on our drinks and informed us that the meal was almost ready.  When she brought our meal she informed me that the sauce was also vegan (just in case I wondered).  I had a Gyro one other time at a vegan restaurant and it wasn't as good as this one.  It was amazing.  Meat eaters, Vegetarians and Vegans can all enjoy something in this nice environment!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I stopped in for dinner one night after wanting to try Jammy Buggars for a while, and were severely underwhelmed. The best part about the entire dinner was the stuffed mushroom appetizer. Man were those caps good! BUT (and this is a big but), there were only 3 stuffed mushrooms on the plate. For 8.50, I at the very least should not have to knife and fork the last cap to ensure two people get an equal share. That kind of set the mode of the entire dinner experience.  However the burgers were severely mediocre. My fiancees tasted like a block of salted meat (she had the Juicy Jim) and mine just had some odd, oniony flavor (I had the Gourmet) - it was not good. The beer selection, I found also left something to be desired.   It just wasn't good enough to justify a $45+ bill. I most likely won't be coming back here, not with all the other awesome places to try around Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been delicious! I enjoy a good burger and they make a good one here. They have so many delicious options for burgers. My personal favorite they actually don't have anymore and it was called the \"OMG\" burger. It was awesome! I remember it being very cheesy. They also have delicious hand cut fries and I love the homemade potato chips. If you are looking for a place to get a great burger and a beer check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group to experience vegan wing night. I had not been here in years, and was excited to see what had changed for the better. The place is layed out into the dining area, a bar, and a room for parties which is rarely used for restaurant seating. It was not too busy, but was not dead quiet, which is good for a smaller place on a Thursday night. We ordered vegan macaroni and cheese, a modified sandwich (\"The Ex\"/ The Susan) to be vegan, and of course the vegan wings. The mac and cheese was just alright and the sauce was a little thin. The sandwich was a little dry, but that was to be expected due to the pesto being omitted during the vegan modification. The provided balsamic vinegar as a substitute but is was not the same. The wings were made of beer-battered breading sweet potato, and although that may sound strange, they were fantastic! The wings were flavorful, had a nice bite to them, and did not feel too potatoey at all. Instead of being coated, a plentiful amount of the sauce of your choosing was put on the side. Metered parking can be found on Detroit Road, on nearby side-streets, and in a back lot (which fills up). We will be back soon for more vegan wings!"}
{"text":"It's a bummer to write this. Unfortunately, one of our burgers came out rare. It happens. No one is perfect. The problem: came from waiting 10min to find a server to try and fix this issue. Then waiting another 30min to get a replacement burger. The big issue: no apology or even a hint of sympathy for the situation. Like this happens often. Burger came out without any type of acknowledgement of what had happened. Bill was standard. Makes me think this is an everyday experience. Don't bother. This place used to be really good."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a while to try this place, well we did it! Clever names for things on the menu. Pricing was average, service was terrible, slow, slow and slow! Burger was done great but tasteless and dry! Nothing at all to recommend to anyone! Could not ask for any additional sauce to go it because no one came to check back with us. On the fence of trying this place again! At least my friends race about it. Guess we've been spoiled goi g to other local places! Oh well, we tried!"}
{"text":"Large portion of fries and they were nice and hot. They were too thick for me and kind of wet like, undercooked . My vegan burger was a most likely a frozen Boca patty. It was tasteless. My husband had The Smoky burger. He said it was very average tasting. Nothing special. Not bad or good. He also thought the fries were undercooked and unseasoned. We both wished we would have went to Melt down the street. Also, the waitress was unfriendly or depressed or something."}
{"text":"I went to Jammy Buggars on a Saturday around 8pm. There was a 30min wait for a table! Every seat was taken at the bar too, but within 10mins someone got up and I was able to get their seat. My friend finally showed up and she was able to get a bar seat within 5mins. By that time we were next on the wait list, but we decided to stay at the bar. The bartender was nice and gave me some suggestions on IPAs.  Not too noise. Good crowd. We did not eat, just a couple beers. I would definitely go back, I want to try to The EX and the Vegan Chicken Gyro."}
{"text":"Love this place they have one of the best burgers in Cleveland,and you can't beat their half off burgers from 4-6 every evening. Likable more like bombtastic you should check It out for yourself, if you don't it's your loss."}
{"text":"I've been a Jammy Buggars cheerleader for as long as I can remember! Taking people to this small charming restaurant to revel at the long beer list and try something off of the eclectic menu. There's literally something for everyone here.   That being that my last few visits have left a bad taste in my mouth. The service has been sub par are best. Step it up ladies, smile a little!! My last visit we went for wing night and the actual wing itself was tasty but the sauces were horrible. Bland and tasted like butter. Yuk. I hope they get it together here because I would love to come back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"I only come here for one reason - grass fed beef burgers on the cheap!  They do have a good beer selection too.  Good atmosphere and usually pretty crowded.  Otherwise everything else I've had here is deep fried and makes me feel like crap the next day."}
{"text":"This place was really good! We came at 6:30 on a Friday and were seated right away. They had a pretty good beer menu and while their menu is not extensive, I found a couple things I wanted to try! I ended up with the lobster and shrimp roll and it was delicious! My mom got the burger which she liked too! Their jammy dipping sauce was also great!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed tonight to find that the menu changed. My boyfriend and i's top choices have all been taken off be menu. Please bring back the Akron burger, the steak Salad (SO bummed), the chorizo burger, and the chicken parm sandwhich. I had the chicken and waffle burger tonight which was just ok. Fries are great as always but was just so bummed by my top choices being gone."}
{"text":"We went to Jammy Buggars for the first time last night and were very happy with the food and service as well as the atmosphere.   Highlights: They let us taste multiple draft beers before deciding which we wanted to order, the harvest salad was good enough that I already want another one, the portions left us satisfied but not feeling grossly stuffed (I could have saved prob a third of my dinner without walking away hungry), and our table had a great view of Detroit.   Challenges: It was pretty noisy and I was initially afraid that we wouldn't be able to hear each other, but we asked for a quiet spot and didn't have any problems. I was pleasantly surprised.   Overall, the menu prices were on par with similar local restaurants and the food offerings were varied, interesting, and delicious. We are definitely going to return for more."}
{"text":"Highly recommend ! Leaving here stuffed and satisfied. I got the turkey burger and my boyfriend got the Detroit burger whatever it was called . All I gotta say this place is awesome and totally worth it IF you are craving a great burger. Oh plus the mozz balls are great too came with pesto sauce on top which is my fav.  Ps.s sweet potato fries to replace the regular fries (even tho the regular fries are just as good ) AMAZING, + garlic aioli sauce . You're Welcome."}
{"text":"Can't say I was impressed. The space is nice - they've built a nice bar and there's a good selection of beers available. But the food was disappointing. I had the wings, which came with almost no sauce and thus didn't taste like anything. I also had some kind of beet & arugula salad which was good, but probably hard to screw up. The fries looked and tasted like they came out of the freezer at Giant Eagle. Overall, it seems like they're trying to be creative (which is good), but the execution falls short.   I'd go back to JB's for a beer, but not to eat."}
{"text":"I have been to JBs many times since I wrote my previous review last year. Their menu has changed a bit but most of the items I have had have all been very good. I would give it 5 stars but the past 2 times we have been the service has been very slow. However, it is still a great addition to the dining choices in Lakewood. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Jammy Buggers has quickly become one of my favorite places in Lakewood!!!   The food has always been excellent ..as well as the selection ....and service.   I find their entire menu appealing and it is hard to choose just one thing. They also have delicious desserts. The dining room and restrooms are always super clean and the atmosphere is nice. Fun to eat at the bar and hang out or going with family. Great prices and definitely extra special ingredients on most of the meals.   Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I genuinely do not understand why people like this place. I've been here 3 times and every time I'm disappointed. The servers all seem green and confused. The BBQ \"chips\" they serve you are like stale kettle chips. Beer selection is good and it's affordable but that's all they have going for them."}
{"text":"Best bugers in Lakewood hands down. This is a must if you want a good burger and you are near Lakewood. Akron burger is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The 1/2 off all burgers deal from 3:00 - 6:00 pm coupled with $3.00 craft beer drafts from 3:00 - 7:00 pm is one of the best Cleveland happy hour deals for quality  + quantity + price! Their beef burger is super tasty, it's so juicy that it can make the bun soggy, which not all people may like, but I don't mind. The turkey burger has a savory / sweet breakfast-like twist, it's loaded with bacon, brie cheese, thinly sliced apple and a little maple syrup, yum! I believe there is a vegan burger option too, and there's definitely a vegetarian burger option. All the burgers get fries and I believe you can upgrade to a different side for a fee. I've been to Jammy Buggars about 7 or 8 times now, and I've enjoyed everything I've had. The only thing I thought was \"meh\" was the mac n cheese side, I've had it twice in the past and thought it was kinda bland, however that was a while ago so perhaps it is different now. And lastly, while I've never had an exceptionally bad service experience, I'd say there's a general sense of apathy with the service I've encountered, and even some blatant glumness. Cheer up staff!"}
{"text":"Jammy Buggars is a fun place. Like most of the Cleveland area, it has a large variety of craft beer to choose from. But, for some reason that I find hilarious, it also has a lot of 40oz bottles. Want to drink a 40oz of Busch lite or Colt 45 in a bar with great food? Jammy Buggars is your place.   I've been here a few times for various different things, but each time the food has been great. Burgers, wings, brunch... you can't really go wrong with any of those choices. They have good wing specials during the week.   Parking can be a pain, but there is usually enough street parking around the area for it to be a minor problem. I am only giving 4 stars because I have had some minor problems with the servers coming around enough."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night when burgers are half price! I like this place because they use fresh local ingredients.  The beef comes from a farm in Wooster, which I am particularly excited about because I went to the College of Wooster and I have a special place in my heart for it :) They also do trivia, always an added perk to a restaurant.  One downer is that there is metered parking before 6pm."}
{"text":"Super bummed out this place wasn't as pleasurable as my sister & her friends made it out to be. Our waitress was nice & very attentive so you can't go wrong with their service. But you can make the mistake of eating their food.   I ordered their jojo's, which were cut much too thick to be jojo's (more like potato wedges) & covered in this strange fried chicken-like tasteless batter. It tasted like I was eating a plain baked potato :( But the dipping sauce that came with it was okay... I also ordered their mac -n- cheese (just noodles & sauce, no sausage or veggies) and they also failed to get this right as well. Again, the sauce was very bland; even after adding salt it had not flavor. So I tried a bite of my fiances Hawaiian Pulled pork sandwich, the meet was tough but the sauce was good. He said there were 3 large chunks of really tough meat  but the rest was cooked perfectly. But not worth the investment.   Glad I live over an hour away 'cause Applebee's  (minus the sexist treatment of their female employees) is looking pretty appealing right now."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. I was brought to Jammy Buggars  last night for a good friends art gallery showing. We were in the big room on the left side for the art gallery. Our waitress was on the ball: super fast and attentive. I ordered the salmon blt and had french fries with the jammy buggar sauce and it was out of this world.  I brought half of it home and my boyfriend ate it and enjoyed it and he doesn't even like salmon.  A friend of mine had the OMG burger and she raved about that. I will definitely be coming back. Great food and great staff! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Four stars solely on the drinks.  Went here for his work Christmas party, so as the food was not the normal (included sliders of a wide variety, dips, etc) menu, I feel like I can't review the place until I've had the food. So...solely on the creativity of this place, I give it four stars for is drinks.  He kept mentioning we were going to \"jammy buggars\", and here, I was thinking he was just trying to say \"burgers\" with a British accent...until I actually saw the sign. Apparently the name is British slang for \"Jammy Buggar (British Slang). A lucky individual, favored, charmed, blessed, serendipitous. He just won the lottery, that Jammy Buggar!\". Oh my. haha.  They had a nice party room, complete with a bar, darts, jukebox, and a couple of arcade games (and yes, one of them included Pac man!). The burger sliders were pretty tasty... although the dips and the cupcakes they served afterwards were so-so. But the drinks!  Their selection is quite wide, but this isn't your normal pub. Instead, they have MIXES for your beer. Yes, pop and beer, who would have thought? Two specific ones were super super tasty- one being the root beer with Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, and the Black Christmas, consisting of Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Guiness. Whoa, those were amazing mixes, my fave being the root beer mix. We tried the Black Bite (Guiness and Coke) and Westside Snakebite (Lager and Sin Cider).... which were alright..but not as good as the previous two.  It's a cool place and the service was good with such a large party. Definitely a fun place to have a work party or a gathering...."}
{"text":"Tastey food and friendly service!  We were served a bowl of garlic barbeque chips immediately as soon as we sat down.  Nice touch.  The chips are amazingly good albeit very salty.  I don't eat burgers or chicken so I planned to order the salmon.  Unfortunately the salmon is marinated in the sauce so you can't order it plain.  The veggie burger has a great taste - I think it's fried? so not healthy but really good flavor.  Be aware for those avoiding soy that it's got whole soybeans and it's not vegan.  They do offer a vegan burger, FYI.  The waitress was friendly and her style of serving was just right - there with a refill without us having to ask, checked in appropriately to see how everything was and see if we needed anything and prompt with the check when we finished.  My friend had the shrimp and lobster roll and it was great as well.  I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a High end burger joint. Their menu changes, ingredients are fresh, and everything is delicious. I've only sat at the bar but service kept me from 5 stars. Lot to be desired there."}
{"text":"I dare you to find a better burger special in Cleveland. 3p to 6pm half off. The fries are better than democracy."}
{"text":"Soggy fries, mediocre service, and not much of a vegetarian selection make this less of a favorite for me.  The beer selection is good and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I've had a better burger, but I've never had consistently as good of a burger meal as I do every time I'm here.  I always customize my burger slightly and they never mess it up.  Sounds simple but happens everywhere else.  I also love their sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Some out of town visitors prove to be the push we needed to finally get in to Jammy Buggars.  The wife and I had sampled their wares at Taste of Lakewood just prior to their opening, so we were looking forward to trying some more off of the menu.    Our party of four and a half covered a lot of ground on the menu, and for the most part everyone was really pleased with their order, it breaks down like this:  The mac and cheese is delicious - this opinion is shared by a 2 year old and a 35 year old.  The regular fries were pretty good as well.   The turkey cutlet BLT and BBQ potato chip pork loin sandwich were both very good too.  The Pork Loin sandwich especially, with the BBQ chips and BBQ sauce pairing really well with the tender pork.  The Sweet potato waffle fries that accompanied both were good, but maybe a little bland.  The Chicken paprikash looked delicious and tasted delicious, passing with flying colors after being tested on the palate of someone who was born and raised in the \"old world\".  Lastly, the regular old hamburger was delicious too.  There's plenty of places in Lakewood to get a burger of this caliber, but it's nice to have options.   There were a couple of issues that made this a three star rating as opposed to four.   1. The service was a little inattentive.  Once our order was placed we only saw our server a couple more times, our drinks going empty and staying that way until the check came and we asked for refills.  Maybe they were short handed that night (it didn't seem that way though), or it was busy, but regardless, still kind of a drag.  2. My wife ordered a medium well burger that came out just past rare.  She said something to the server about it, who offered to take it back to be cooked some more, but at that point it was a little late.   Overall, this is pretty good gastropub food in a comfortable setting.  I wouldn't mind going back for the food, and if the kinks in the service can get worked out, this would be an excellent place to go for some pub grub."}
{"text":"The OMG as a veggie burger is hands down the best in town. It's hand made and hearty. Not burnt, crumbly bean veggje patties restaurants try to pass off as a burger. This is a thick juicy burger that may have you questioning if it's beef or not. Having the mushrooms and \"buggar\" sauce also adds a bit of pizzaz. Their pickles are more like a cucumber in the sense they arent overly sour, but still have a soft crunch. Perfect combo on the OMG. Top it off with a side of their awesome, crispy sweet potato fries and you're in heaven. This veggie friendly meal will fill you up and tastes delish too! Highly recommend giving it a try, even if you're a meat lover."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch there with friends!  They have a huge beer list and a lot of great meals to chose from.  The Detroit Theater burger was excellent, abundant, great fries.  Everyone was impressed with their food.  The service was excellent and the place was hopping on a Saturday at lunch time.  I look forward to going back to try the lobster rolls and a few other items.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going out to eat with my Ma, and this place is quickly becoming our go-to. We were stuck on Deagan's for a while. I still enjoy Deagan's. I just don't think as much as I enjoy this place. People wait for hours at Melt down the street when they can come here and save time and have better food and service. The beer list is pretty good. Mom and I had some Founders Double Trouble Imperial IPA tonight. We came here a few weekends ago for their Friday fish fry. The walleye was great. The filet cheese steak sandwich was her favorite. I have been ordering The Ex sandwich which is grilled chicken with tomato, avocado, buffalo mozzarella and basil pesto. It reminds me of the asiago chicken sandwich at Southside. The service is warm and friendly. I am a good judge of a character and the people working there seem to be decent. I am sure people do not really read my reviews or pay attention to the things that I type, but if I could get one person to go here and enjoy the place, my soul will be set free."}
{"text":"Took the family there for our first visit. Motz balls and crab balls were ok. Tough price at $8.50 a piece. The burgers and Chix slammi were also ok.with all the competition in Lakewood, not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yelp page says they close at 1am when in reality they close at 11pm.  I drove and 75 minutes to try this place... closed.  So I had to drive another 75 minutes home in a fit of disgust.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I found my burger cooked perfectly as requested. The presentation and temperature were fine and the menu options extensive and creative, but my burger was tasteless. It was a special Pad Thai burger but I might as well have been eating a regular plain burger. I suppose it wasn't bad, but for the things that were supposed to be on it it was very boring. My friend's Mac and cheese was soupy and there was little sausage. There was mostly broccoli and large chunks of it to fill the dish up. Service was friendly, though for a bit we felt forgotten about and no one returned to check on the food. I'd love to return and try some other burgers as there were many that sounded good on the menu, but if they'll all taste the same what's the use."}
{"text":"I don't get to come to Jammy Buggars as often as I would like, but they have one of my favorite sandwiches in the city. The Ex (previously, the Susan), is everything I ever wanted in a sandwich. Fresh, zesty, perfectly balanced flavor. It's amazing and pairs so perfectly with a cold beer. I could eat one every day."}
{"text":"I had a really good Hamburg and Heath added the blue cheese to the bugar it was great (it comes with bacon on it). I would go back to this place anytime!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been multiple times and everything that I have had has been delicious. It is always a difficult decision trying to decide what to get. As far as appetizers go the crab balls are the best in my opinion. With that said, the swedish meatballs and mozzarella balls are no slouches. The burgers that are on the everyday menu are excellent and hard to choose from and that is not including their burger of the month. I have had 2 of their special burgers (Caribbean jerk & mac&cheese burger)  and they were both amazing. Out of the regular menu my favorite is the Del Feliz Fernando. The chorizo patty is just the right amount of spice and the peppadew cheese with avocado adds a mouthful of flavor. The turkey burger and the smokey are a good choice as well. The burgers come with hand cut fries but can be substituted for other sides. I always go with the fries because they have great flavor. One of the best things about Jammy's is the dipping sauces that you can get for the fries. I have tried all of the sauces but my top 2 are the Jammy Buggar sauce and chipotle honey. The Jammy sauce reminds me of Zaxby's sauce which is one of my favorite sauces I've ever had so this hits home for me. So far everything I have had keeps me coming back for more.   Jammy's also has a great beer selection. They usually have a great seasonal collection on draft as well as an extensive bottle list. They also have the classics such as PBR and Coors. If beer is not your forte they also have a full bar and a wine selection. Their happy hour is hard to beat, especially with the wine. During happy hour if you buy 2 glasses a wine you get the rest of the bottle! No worries if you can't finish the bottle, they let you take it home with you. The atmosphere is quite delightful. it is family friendly as well as a local hangout out for the younger crowds. On Wednesday nights they also offer trivia which is a lot of fun. I'm new to the Cleveland area but Jammy's is definitely one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"So far, its a cozy, quiet little place. Vegan wrap was pretty darn good. I didnt drink due to a little princess I had the pleasure of eating this meal with. Beer selection seemed decent enough. It was under 10$ a person, good staff very friendly."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger in Cleveland. B Spot doesn't even compare in my opinion. The beef itself is excellent and they're not trying to do anything overly sophisticated, just a damn good burger. I could eat it plain.  The fries are great so make sure you don't fill up on the fresh house-made potato chips served to each table. Though it's easier said than done. I recommend trying some of the dipping sauces with your meal.  The bar offerings are adequate with something to please everyone. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and provide excellent customer service.  There is a small lot behind, but there is also plenty of street parking around.  Prices are fair and reflect the quality of the meal without feeling like you're overpaying."}
{"text":"I'd been trying to go here for ages.  In my mind, it'd be like Deagans.  A gastropub that while good, isn't exactly going to have you leaving with doggy bags.    Ahh, but Deagens it is not!    Jammy Bugger's pretty much blew my Lakewood world.  The food was well priced, super delicious, huge, and the wait staff was great!  I think this location may have finally broken the curse of the \"failing restaurant\"!!  We ordered the fish fry and some extra fries.  The fish was huge, perfectly breaded and all the sides were delicious!  Even the pickle impressed me.  Yes, you read that right...I was even impressed by the pickle!!  Right now it's Lent and they have more fish options then any Friday night Catholic Church in the region!    In other words.  Yes, I will be back.  Maybe even this week!"}
{"text":"This place was a-ok! Came on a Friday night and we were seated relatively quickly which was nice. The host and our server were very friendly.  First to comment on the drinks, I'm not really a beer person but they had a ton. Even had some vanilla porter mixed with root beer which even for an avid beer hater was tolerable! The menu covers all the things you would want, lots of fried delicious, some burgers and sandwiches.  We started with the balls, mozzarella and crab. The mozzarella were the better of the two. They came with a basil pesto that smelled sooo good. The crab balls we also good, but if you have to pick, go with mozz balks.  I ordered the vegan chicken gyro. I, for the record am not vegan or vegetarian, but it sounded good. Reminded me of a menu item at my fave restaurant in Perrysburg. My dish turned out to not be the greatest. It was dry and didn't have a lot of flavor.  But! My husband ordered the OMG burger, that was really good! Juicy, cooked well, and the fries were pretty good! Another at the table ordered fish and chips, huge portion and pretty tasty.  Overall, I'd come back. Next time I'll order something different and hopefully be able to upgrade a star."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Ohio I make sure to stop in here and eat.  And drink.  And eat some more.  And of course drink some more.  The food has always been excellent.  The service is always excellent.  The beers for the t-shirt challenge are disgusting but that's what adds to the fun of it.  I look forward to visiting them again soon!  I get hungry just thinkin about this place..."}
{"text":"Great food with a wonderful selection of beers on tap.  Friendly staff!  I enjoy the selection of french fries and dipping sauces."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. We love the food! It's the service that is unpredictable...tonight we met our friends there for wing night. 3 of us ordered wings and a side salad. One ordered the omg burger and ordered it without cheese as he is lactose intolerant. We even joked with the server to underline No cheese. We waited a very long time for our food. My husband could see our salads sitting at window so he asked how much longer it would be for our food. He brought salads and a few minutes later wings and finally the burger with cheese! We sent it back and when it was returned he admitted they had scraped off the cheese. We reiterated the dairy allergy and manager came over to check about the bun which had butter...the burger finally came after everyone else had finished their food. Burger and fries were good but gluten free bun was dry and crumbly. Manager did deduct burger from bill which was nice."}
{"text":"Nice wine and beer selection. I couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted to eat (which is a good sign of a good food selection), but I ended up getting the Lobster / Shrimp Roll. Holy hell it was delicious. the toasted bun was toasted to perfection. VERY happy with my experience. Server was very friendly and efficient as well."}
