{"text":"The rare beef Pho was fantastic great service, I will be back"}
{"text":"Pho broth is good! Came here on a rainy day after a 12 hour shift with my classmates and it really hit the spot! The egg rolls were delicious as well, nice and piping hot, the way it should be. I only tried the pho with flank steak, but the rice dishes looked pretty delicious as well with an egg on top of the rice."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife and two year old. Service was excellent. Food cam out fast and tasted great we had the 17 and 22. We really really liked the 17. We also ordered the spring rolls and they were very good. Definitely a great place to have good Pho at an inexpensive price."}
{"text":"Average pho.  Spring rolls also average.  Staff is very nice, parking and location are convenient.  I would go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fast service. Very friendly.  Great portions too.  So far I have tried the pork chop with broken rice and egg, and Pho with beefballs and rare steak.  Both were delicious, and there was enough for leftovers.   I am very happy to have a good pho spot close to my house!"}
{"text":"Great place. Affordable, quick, welcoming and delicious. Favorite place to eat. Local restaurant and they take great care of you. Sweet service."}
{"text":"I went there with my mom and ordered take out few times. They are fast and one dollar more expensive then most places, but their food is very good. They portions are big and well priced. They are very welcoming . This is the place I love to go for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Best service I ever had in Las Vegas; the guy who assist us gave us an outstanding service."}
{"text":"The food here are fresh and excellent. Pricing is very reasonable and such large portions! I had the Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli and the Shrimp Spring Rolls. Next time I'm going to try the Pho and some other dish."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice. Music playing in the background but not too loud you can't hear your friends. Food wise, the Pho is well seasoned and has a good amount of contents vs. broth. Pad Thai is slightly different in taste from its Thai version but tastes very good. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is very good! They are always accommodating to all of my family's special requests (there are a lot!). I like the hu tieu mi (pork noodle soup) and my daughter likes the pork chop over rice. The location is close to home too. The servers are nice and the restaurant is kept clean. I am glad they are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This my neighborhood go to for Pho  Great broth, I always order #17, can't go wrong.  The egg rolls are great, we like to wrap them with lettuce and dip them in the sauce.  Lian has tried just about every soup on the menu and likes them all.  The waitstaff is always friendly and they know the menu really well, especially the Gringo."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when I first came here and was pleasantly surprised. The food is AWESOME. And the owner personally stopped by to have a conversation with us. She is very attentive and hard working and cares about her customers. I now come here regularly and whenever the owner is there she always has a warm greeting and a smile."}
{"text":"We are regular patrons of the original so we were STOKED to see a new Pho Annie right by our house. We went today and got our favorites, and it is just as delicious as the other location. This place is seriously so good. Their pho broth is the best I've ever had. Their pork chops are to die for. The potstickers are also so good! Try it, it won't disappoint! Amazing, fast, and friendly service and this new location is spotless."}
{"text":"Found this place yesterday and hubby and I decided to give it a try. We loved it! Hubby had the curry and rice. He loved it and I loved it. I kept taking curry from his bowl. I had the lemon grass chicken and soup. Everything was so tasty. The chicken has very well cooked and the soup was fragrant and it really complemented the chicken. The service was great, they really made us feel welcome and they made sure we were very well taken care of. We live on the north side but will def do the drive for this place."}
{"text":"Even better than the first!   Annie runs a great place.  The food is always great.  The best Vietnamese I've ever had.   The spring rolls are perfect.  The sauce is good.  I don't know what they do to the chicken but I dream about the pho ga its so good."}
{"text":"Great local pho place in the SW. The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating and even know me by name now. The food is GREAT and the restaurant itself is always super clean. Very highly recommended Vietnamese spot."}
{"text":"We saw their signs few weeks ago, so we went to check it out the other day. They're very close  to us  and convenient. My husband ordered some kind of fried rice (sorry I can't remember which one) but he loved it. It was so good he finished  the whole thing (I was shocked! ). And as for me, I ordered a vegan pho. It's not in the menu  but I asked the waiter and they can make it, they have vegetable broth, which was really  tasty. And the waiter has been so helpful. I was curious with some other menu that they may offer as vegan and he went out of his way to actually find the answers for me. He said he's vegetarian and he understands how it is. We look forward to going back there again."}
{"text":"I'm no pho connoisseur but this restaurant has good friendly service, CLEAN, and the food is great. So nice having a closer pho place so I don't have to navigate the dangers of spring mountain Rd"}
{"text":"I live very close so was excited to have a pho restaurant nearby. Soon as we walked in it was a bit awkward. No music and was super quiet. The TV was on with no volume. My friend and I both ordered  the vegan Pho. It was ok. But the basil they brought was brown and wilted and was bit of a turn off, the noodles were mushy and the veggies were cut so huge they were hard to eat. They have a picture on their door with Thai tea with boba in it but they don't have boba available. Disappointing . Overall I would not repeat."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, everytime has been really good. We had the pho the first couple times. This time tried the pork chop w/rice and egg. It was delicious and the serving size was big. This is the  best authentic Vietnamese food we've found in the Summerlin area.  We will be going back often."}
{"text":"I like the pho here.  Exactly how it should taste.   I ordered pho tai and some thai tea.  Very fast service.  Didnt wait long at all for my food.   Very happy."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner and was not disappointed! The  food was good and the service was even better! Glad this spot is literally around the corner from my house, I will be back here eating again probably next week and the weeks to follow! There's no reason for me to head to Chinatown if this restaurant is so close by!"}
{"text":"Clean quiet place. We were waited on immediately.  Very pleasant wait staff took our orders with no paper in hand.  Orders came out very fast.  We ordered spring rolls and egg rolls.  The wife said her spring rolls were good but a little chewy.  My eggs rolls were very hot and served with two sauces.  Egg rolls were great.  Nice and crispy.  The wife had the grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl.  She said it was okay.  The grilled pork did not have a really good char on it and it was also quite fatty.  My roast duck with noodles was very good.    Will go back."}
{"text":"PHOsure one of the best I've had. Broth was authentic not water and paste, but real bone broth! Iced Jasmine tea is always a sign that your in the right place! Bowl with rare and tendon fixed with fresh greens and the right amount of sliced onions. Now for the Viet Egg rolls done right fresh butter lettuce to wrap them for dipping. They have a pork chop plate with over easy eggs I'm all over that my next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm not into Pho, but my wife is. I usually order and pick up for her. She really likes it, so it must be good."}
{"text":"5 stars for fresh-brewed Thai iced tea. As an avid Thai tea drinker, I have to say having the gentleman tell us that they don't use a powder mix made me love this place even more!  On to the food... I ordered #14 Well Done Flank Pho & hubby got #50 Pork Chop w/ shredded egg? We also had to get the Vietnamese egg rolls because that's just a staple for us when we eat pho. I was impressed at how hot everything was & it felt like we didn't even wait that long for the food (which is pretty awesome in my book). Another important tip: hubby & I are THIRSTY & drink water like nobody's business. They PASSED out water test w/ flying colors, meaning they never let our waters go more than half empty. Thumbs up, Pho Annie 2!  Would definitely come back again, especially since we are just down the street!"}
{"text":"My family and I love love love this place. The service is ALWAYS great and the Pho is very tasty. They also have a variety of things on there menu including Kal bi ribs (I would recommend) and holo holo for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I come here a lot because  I live very close  from this restaurant.  They always smile make me feel like home! Food is great and nice clean. Very fast service  highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is basic and plain but the food is awesome. I keep going back for the #13. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. They just opened and i must say, the food is AMAZING!!!! The people there are very nice. I like the fact that it is near my house too!"}
{"text":"I used to live somewhat close to the original Pho Annie and this one might be even better than the original?!?!? How is that possible??? Since the other spot is delicious, too?? But it is. If u like curry, get the curry noodle soup!!!"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat. Service is awesome. Annie will be there to talk to you and is very friendly. This was my first Pho experience. Since then I have been back 3 times in 2 days. Being a Vegan it is difficult to find great tasting food when I eat out. I can eat there guilt free and belly full. A must try experience and the price is great."}
{"text":"Writing this draft review while sitting here eating....4.5 stars?!?!?! Sorry...but this is no 4.5 star viet food! Pho beef noodle soup...soup is way too sweet no beef flavor at all. Bun rue, cab meat noodle soup...again the soup..even my husbands crab meat noodle soup is way way better than this place. The only thing I'd probably give them props for r the egg rolls. Meaty and flavorful."}
{"text":"Had their pork over rice. 10 bucks for a giant plate of food, the pork was tender, the egg perfectly cooked and everything was tasty and well cooked. Service was quick and pleasant, would highly recommend it for a lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken curry soup and it was amazing.  Best lunch i have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the original, in a cute, more modern location. The shrimp spring rolls are perfect (the peanut sauce is the best). Loved the Pho Dat Biet (#13)...beef was tender and the broth was amazing. The service is phenomenal. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great new location. bigger and more spacious than the original.  Best pho in the valley. Staff are friendly and service is excellent Highly recommend either location."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered the Mix soup with the vegetables and meat.  It was amazing.  I live not far away from this place.  I will defiantly order more from them.  I really hope it will be always good like it was yesterday.  Thanks you so much Pho Annie 2"}
{"text":"The food is always on point and hits the spot! The staff is very friendly and patient! The place is also always clean and I love their tables ~"}
{"text":"we wanted to like this pho resteraunt since it's in our area but every time my husband orders  beef stew they can't seem to get his order right. we have been nice and patient with the service but it's happened 4 times and the last time they took his bowl away to \"fix\" the order we could tell they transferred the meat, veg and noodles and replaced his broth with hot water. I even checked the consistency and tasted the broth. it definitely wasn't the same. don't go here! if you ask for a simple request like egg noodles instead of rice noodles. you never know what they will do to your food in the back!!"}
{"text":"Love this Pho joint!! I think an American dude manages this place or something bc he's always there when we visit.  I appreciate this because there's less of a language barrier when I call in my order and I feel more assured I'm ordering what I want.  We typically get the beef ball noodle soup and an appetizer like the gyoza, which are delicious.  They are priced fairly and I'll definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, ordered the Pho ga white meat. Broth was watered down. The only thing that helped me finish the dish was the extra amounts of housin sauce and chili sauce."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to place for pho. My fav is the chicken pho with veggies. My daughter said they have the best vegan pho she's had and the husband loves their tendons in pho. The thai tea here is my fav. Every single thing we've tried has been awesome!! Service is the best!! Place is super clean!"}
{"text":"I have been to the original Pho Annie about 25 plus times. I was so excited to hear a new Pho Annie was opening up right in my hood, so I didn't have to drive 20 minutes to get to my fave Vietnamese restaurant.   We order the exact same thing each time we go, pretty much. My hubby gets the pork chop with broken rice and fried egg. I get Pho Tai or Bun Thit Nuong.   I love the decor inside and it is way better than the other location which is dated with ripped seats at several of their booths. It is clean, modern, new, with high ceilings. Service seemed off (very to the point and quick) which is normal for most Asian restaurants, but we usually get a slightly better vibe from the waiters at the other restaurant.   On to the food-hubby's pork chop was served not on a plate, but on a half plate/half bowl. It has ridges on the edge going around it. I am not trying to be super picky but if you are Filipino you eat with a fork and spoon, and the ridges make it really hard to scoop up your food on to your spoon. My hubby was having a hard time with this fancier plate. We don't need the fancy, we would be perfectly happy with the regular plain dishes.   My bun had a hair in it, which was not mine. I was disgusted and never came back. Makes me sad because this is truly my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. I know hairs happen, but it just grosses me out when it's my first time eating there and I find a hair.   I also got pho to go one time since then giving them one more chance and the pho tasted off. Broth was flavorless. For now, I am going to stick to their original location. I hope to give them another shot one day at this location."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was disappointed. The service was horrible and the food was just not good. Very bland. No one at our table of five enjoyed their food. The only thing that made it bearable was drenching it in seasoning and spicy sauce. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very good food for being in the Southwest. Don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown for a bowl of pho. So glad there's finally good Vietnamese food in this part of town."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, good food! We enjoyed it. Order rise with chicken...yummy"}
{"text":"Nothing particularly that stood out in my visit. Was in the neighborhood and didn't feel like driving to Spring Mtn to eat pho. The pricing was good but the soup wasn't anything special. The portion size didn't completely fill me up, $8. Ordered the #16 beef steak + beef ball. It's a generally quiet location which is nice if you want to escape all the noise, with that being said, the service was minimal as well. + for having a clean environment  + tons of variety on the menu!"}
{"text":"IMO, Better than Kim long in china town.  I like the fact that it's very close to Summerlin, the staff are friendly, and the cleanest pho place I've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently close to my home. The interior looks very clean and the food is great here. I no longer have to drive all the way to Chinatown for my pho. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great , Great , Great . I had the shrimp noodle soup which was awesome and we ordered the beef chow fun which was awesome as well . I will be going back and be a regular there for sure .  The portion size was nice as well . The restaurant is very clean inside , the staff is very friendly . Go and enjoy"}
{"text":"The only meal my husband and I order is the veggie pho. The veggies, the condiments and noodles are great. I can never get enough noodles so of course I wish there was more.   The flavor of the broth is not what I am use to. The regular broth is lacking something and the veggie broth leaves an unsatisfying after taste. I wish they could just change the broth and we would probably be dining in/picking up weekly during the cold season because this location is so close to our house.   Pho annie- if you do change your broth, please announce it so we can start dining with you guys again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It was our first time there and found the place through yelp. The ratings were great so we decided to check it out.we got the Curry Chicken noodle soup, Beef stew noodle soup and fresh shrimp rolls. Everything tasted fresh, not frozen. The servers were all very friendly and it had a family feel to it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Picked up to go and got rare beef pho #13 and then the Chicken curry soup. Both were outstanding. Broth flavor of the pho was the best I've ever had. The chicken curry soup has pieces of chicken with bones in it though so be careful. That's the only thing I would take a star away for."}
{"text":"First off, the costumer service is wonderful.  This is my 2nd time here this week,  and the gentleman in the front just makes me smile. Now as far as the Pho? Yes!!!!! It's so hard trying time find a really great pho restaurant without going to China Town. Place is clean and I love it!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get pho and this was right next to my house. This was a change from the normal pho locations on Spring Mtn. It was very quiet inside with only a couple other tables.  I ordered the Pho Tai Nam and the portions were quiet small, it didn't really fill me up and they only have one size for $8.  It was very clean inside and the management was friendly and checked our table quite often.  This location is nothing special, but the location being so close is a plus."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite to eat. Great service and food! Our servers kept our glasses full with water. One of our servers had a sense of humor which was nice. He was quick with the wise cracks!  We ordered pho and some thai tea. The pho was delicious, we usually use more vegetables in our soup but it was okay. They were very generous with the pho portions. That tea was also delicious.   I would recommend stopping here if you're in the area. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a couple friends the eggrolls & porkchop and rice was ok I've had better. What was really weird and disturbing was that the noodle soups we had were all sweet like they poured sugar all over our dishes. I won't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Picked up food on the way home.  Quick take out.  Very nice people.  Food is great.  Tasty broth.  Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in town. I drive from Henderson about once a week to enjoy this place. Amazing food, warm and welcoming staff, amazingly clean from top to bottom. I've never had a bad experience out of my 40+ visits. Forever a fan! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Walking distance from my house. Owners are very nice and welcoming. I always get Pho with rare beef on the side..  Good flavor!"}
{"text":"Quiet. Clean. Good pho!  I usually get satay noodles. Pretty spicy and delicious! It's kinda slow. It's kinda hidden.  But we always get good food and good service."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is excellent. I also love that it is near my house.  This is my favorite pho restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is just average and the service is horrible. Even if you call 15 min. ahead to place an order, there is still a long wait (they weren't even busy). It feels as if they don't cook your order until you get there. Also, when they get your takeout order wrong and you have to drive all the way back to the restaurant to get the right one they are not even the least bit apologetic about it. It's okay if you make a mistake but at least apologize when you caused other people inconvinience. Not worth it to come back again."}
{"text":"I been to many pho places and i think this is a great choice if you want pho and live on the west side.   There are a lot of places that dont have good pho on this side of town, but this place is bomb!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout so I can't speak to the table side service, decor, or overall experience, but the speed and efficiency of takeout was a breeze. I've been sick and since Pho is the cure for all illnesses, hangovers, depression, etc, I had to get my hands on some of this corpse reviver goodness ASAP. I actually couldn't find a menu online so I browsed through the Yelp pics and found some pictures of the menu that someone had took and used that to order (thank you ! Can always rely on yelpers to be extra thorough ;) )   I got the Pho Tai Bo Vien- pho with rare flank steak and beef balls. I asked for extra basil and hoisin on the side and he said it'd be ready in 15 min. I arrived and it was ready to go, he reminded me my extra sides were in the bag, paid my $7.85, and that was that! So affordable, and the portion was quite large. It was really tasty and considering how close it is to my house, I'll definitely be back. If only they delivered!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, second time eating here. The staff is always so friendly and the food is great. Nice clean restaurant, definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Meh.... it was alright.  When it comes to phó for me it's all in the broth.  While the broth was really good, the meat and noodles just didn't really cut it for me.  The potstickers were pretty tasty, and service was great!"}
{"text":"This place is right near my house and has become my once a week lunch go to. The eggrolls are amazing, perfectly crispy and tasty and I love the vermicelli bowls. I don't venture off of what I want much but the grilled marinated pork is great and the shrimp also. I have gone and sat down a few times and service is always good and the place is bright and clean. This place is on the top of my list in Vegas so far for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Great place for some Vietnamese food! Super close to the house and the quality is awesome, will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Came to Annie 2 for the Pho. Lacked a little in the \"meat and potatoes\" of the soup, not enough basil leaves, but overall, just ask expected. Nothing that was overwhelming great like some of the other places I've been to. My son ordered a chicken and rice dish and was a little bland. Service was good and quick and decently priced."}
{"text":"Since I loved the Pho Annie #1, I decided to try Pho Annie #2 on May 28, 2016 with my cousin since it was near my house. Because this place is recently new, this place is VERY CLEAN and the staff prepares the food out FAST and FRESH!   So far at this location, I tried the:  - Spring roll - #42 The Grilled Pork Over Egg with Broken Rice and Soup.   It was very delicious and was shocked that the portion was very HUGE! I was almost full half way while I ate my rice entrée. The staff here is friendly with happiness.   I recommend coming here because the food here is really good, clean place, and better than those Vietnamese restaurants near the Las Vegas Chinatown."}
{"text":"It's just the broth.   Seems very simple, but if you've had a bad broth experience in a Pho establishment you'll understand.   Service is fantastic, local charm is abundant, and the peppers  are  hot  as hell. Again, if you've not had Pho before, it won't make sense.   Wonderful place. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Seen this new Vietnamese place on the way home from work and wanted to try it one day! So we went for dinner there the location I think is not in a busy area so hopefully they will gain patrons by surroundings residents.  We had ordered the Roast Duck with Egg noodle soup and Chicken Curry with Egg Nooldle soup. Both soups were delicious!  Lots of meat and noodles and both was very tasty. Nice to have a Vietnamese place close by home and work and not have to drive to Chinatown. We will definitely be back for many more meals!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Las Vegas for pho. Amazing service, delicious food. The owner is so kind and always here to greet us. We come here a few times a month and we love it! There number 38 is amazing! And of course everything else is as delicious."}
{"text":"I used to think that it would be really hard to tell which restaurant had the best pho because they are all made the same.  I just had lunch here and was amazed that the pho was undeniably better tasting then others I have had, the noodles were even al dente!"}
{"text":"EXACTLY THE SAME AS #1  I have tried the first Annie Pho & was so GLAD that this one tasted EXACTLY the same! This location is VERY VERY close to my house so it is DEFINITELY way  more convenient to go to compare to driving all the way to the first location or to china town for pho unless it is later at night. The restaurant is located all the way in the back end of the plaza if you are entering from Russell road. The interior was very simple & they have TVs all around to keep you distracted.  The server was very friendly. honestly i just LOVE Vietnamese accents... reminds me of all my friends back home ahahaha. He came over & got us started right away. Our food was out within 10 minutes i would have to say. Although one thing was that our egg rolls came out later than our entrees.  VIETNAMESE EGG ROLLS $5.99 - hot & fresh but it came out after all the main entrees.  PLAIN PHO $5.99 - love the broth & they give a loving amount of noodles.  EGG WRAPPED FRIED RICE $9.99 - tasty & big w/ a small serving of soup as well.  PHO W/ TENDON & MEATBALL $7.25 - tendon was PERFECT texture   YOUNG COCONUT $4   THREE COLORED BEANS W/ ICE $3.50 - I wasn't too big of a fan but it wasnt bad."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese food.  This is some of the best I have had since moving to Vegas. Everyone is so friendly and helpful when you have questions. Even the pad Thai is good."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least 1x a month! The Pho is phenomenal and the service is just as good. The owner Eric (sp?) is a really nice guy. He knows us by name and is sure to always have our food come out hot. The flavor is good and the prices are reasonable! Can't say enough good stuff about this place."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho in the valley!   Eric always makes our experience good.   Great customer service!  Great food! We have tried a lot there menu and you can't go wrong..!"}
{"text":"This new pho restaurant is awesome.  The environment is inviting and clean. I got the bbq pork with vermicelli and it was FLAVORFUL.  My wife got the Bun Bo Hue and she was impressed with the authenticity of how it tasted. We are both Vietnamese and highly critical of our pho restaurants. We definitely  recommend Pho Annie 2 if you have the urge for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"No words then WOW !!!  I know there is something wrong with annie pho the 1st , but the second one .. Is not bad at all . First the place is clean the kitchen is huge ( meaning not humide and i believe its clean better then small kitchen and not organized at all )   Second owner is nice , service is great and food is good , i ordered #40 my pork chop is moist and chard , price is not bad at all .   Third .... Idk how to explain but i just love this atsmosfer   Just give it try ..."}
{"text":"I work closeby and love coming here for lunch whenever I'm craving pho and spring rolls!  In fact, I always get either the chicken (pho ga) or beef (pho tai nam).  The broth has a rich taste and soup is hot.  The staff is always prompt with their service and best thing is I always get in and out within my lunch hour even if they are super busy!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today. Hungover from Halloween celebrations, we wanted to get some healthy greens and broth in us. The place had just opened and already people were walking in the door and pulling into the parking lot. Good sign. We ordered wings, spring rolls with shrimp, and a combination Pho. The spring rolls came with two large pieces cut in half. Stuffed to the brim with a plentiful amount of wonderful peanut sauce. (Wish I could make this stuff at home) It also had some mint? Which really gave it a nice kick.   The pho came out next. It was a good sized bowl piled high with ingredients. It had the usual accompaniments; basil, sprouts, lime, and jalapeno. It was a piping hot bowl of soup. Thank god, as sometimes they are not hot after all the ingredients are added. it was great. Only complaint: the broth just wasn't quite rich enough. It felt like it was missing a little flavor. Obviously, still very good as it was finished and licked clean.   Lastly, came the wings. OMG. They were incredibly hot, covered in pressed garlic, and so wonderfully crispy. The aroma really captured us. They were so so so so so good. I had a little spicy chili sauce and hoison on the side for dipping. They were drizzled in butter. So stinking good. Worth every penny. Better than most wing places could have done. Easily.   We will be back. Total was $26. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"My friend with her baby and I went first to this location. And we were very pleased with their service and the food! I will definitely go again~"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Great place for a quick lunch.  We will definitely be back. Beats having to drive down Spring Mountain in the traffic."}
{"text":"I'm soy free, dairy free, and gluten free and this place is my favorite!!!! Clean, delicious, friendly and local. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"You must come here! The presentation of food and its freshness sets the bar. And the service is great too!"}
{"text":"You get a lot of pho. The Vietnamese egg rolls are delicious. Very little msg and rock salt so food is clean. The owner Eric provides excellent service and the pricing is very reasonable!!! So many awesome dishes on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"ok... i could go on for dayyyyys about this wonderful place.  however, im going to save alot of time by saying only 3 things about this outstanding dining establishment:  *  spotlessly clean. ceiling to floor.  *  cust. svc. above and beyond.  *  best pho ive EVER had.  it was well worth the drive from silverado ranch... cant wait to go back!!! highly reccommend!!!"}
{"text":"I just stopped in for the first time and so glad I came in! The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Perfect hole in the wall mom and pop shop style pho restaurant (although there is an original location. The food is great, they have really good customer service, and it's refreshing to see the owner work just as hard. He takes our order without writing anything down, interacts with his customers, and even participates with me during wheel of fortune! I keep going back to this place because of the great food and service! So pho-tunate to have a place like this closeby."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the broth here. The broth has a very clean, non-fatty taste which I love!! Egg rolls are tasty and the the pho is wonderful! I usually go to Jennipho but since this location is closer to my house ill frequent here now. I do wish they had an option where I could build my own pho."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for a while, and always thought about going there. It seriously lives up to its high Yelp rating! Super fast and friendly service, and the food is incredible. First thing I noticed was how clean the place was, and I was greeted with friendly faces and a nice conversation. We chose take out, and I seriously have enough food for three meals! This is our new favorite Pho place, and we plan on visiting often. Best Pho place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. I expected hole in the wall service but was surprised by the friendly staff which is so hard to come by in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've ate here twice now. I'm glad they finally put a decent pho place near my house. I ordered the spring rolls and shrimp pho. The springs rolls were delicious and large, some of the best in town. The shrimp pho wasn't my favorite in town, but it was still really good. Ill definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho. The serving size is generous!  Very cool little place in spring valley. I got the rare steak brisket, it was too much for me so I took the rest home. The have two tvs playing in the backround but its stil a calm place to eat and enjoy your food. Will definitely come back. We found our spot for pho!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. Rare steak Pho and egg rolls were delicious. Beef stir fry vermicelli was awesome. Close to me , this will be our new pho place, no more long drives to the strip"}
{"text":"It's my 1st time here and I have to say the services  and food is excellent. I got the vietnamese iced coffee since there's no Starbucks around the area and is was BOMB. Would definitely recommend friends & family here. So far is the best pho restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Took some friends here for some delicious and filling pho and it did not disappoint.  Fresh veggies and hand wrapped spring rolls daily. Great staff personality and prompt service.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I decided to have linner at Pho Annie and after do some searching on Yelp, I opted to go to Pho Annie 2 which is closer to my neighborhood.  Winter has set in and pho would be a warming welcome from the cold.  I read the reviews and I chose the curry chicken which a good friend had recommended in his review (thanks Philip).  I enjoyed part of my Thai iced tea while I was waiting.    In about 10 minutes, the large bowl of curry chicken soup with noodles was brought to the table.  The broth was rich and very enjoyable.  I added bean sprouts, Thai basil, and all of the jalapeño slices (I wish there had been more because this adds so much to the soup.  About 20 minutes later, I was done with my soup having spotted the table and my sweatshirt with broth from the soup.  Clothes are always a casualty in eating pho and ramen but it washes out.  My only problem with the soup was the chicken pieces were not boneless and my hands were a greasy mess when I was done.  The meal was good."}
{"text":"Food is really good!!! We ordered the black pepper mackerel and combination pho!!! So good!!! I'm surprised it's not busy here on a Friday night. It's probably not the best location but the food is amazing"}
{"text":"This place was open for about a month before I decided to check it out about 2 weeks ago. I have been back about 5 times since then. All the food I tried is delicious and the portions are generous for the price. Get the #40 and #42. You won't be disappointed. All of my food was pickup so I can't comment on dining in but the front desk staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Not really impressed... I use to go 1st one but this location I don't really like the taste... Pho I like to have very very hot soup but always I order pho, soup is not hot especially its noodle ! They close 9pm so after work I need to drive to spring mt to get pho... But couple $$ more cheaper compared to this restaurant"}
{"text":"It's great having a Viet restaurant close by home! I wasn't too hungry but grabbed some appetizers. The Vietnamese egg rolls (my favorite dish I could devour in seconds) and the shrimp spring roll. The food is tasty and fresh! The egg rolls were so delicious :) definitely will be coming back to try the main entrees!"}
{"text":"Does not taste like it use to and there's not alot of meat. My husband got the beef stew one and there was nothing but fat on the meat. Gross! Disappointing. The owner is a sweetheart and customer service is always good. Going to have to find a new pho place though :("}
{"text":"Great food! With great customer service! Eric is always really sweet! The location is great! It's near my apartment homes I live in. The nearby business's are great too! VIP NAILS AND SPA, my boyfriend goes to the barbershop next door, chilli Wiley's yogurt for dessert! Yum! I'm always in these plaza!"}
{"text":"This place will never fail your taste buds. The dining area is usually empty due to the large number of take out orders! So, you can sit in peace and enjoy butter-garlic fried chicken wings and reap the benefits of the body and soul soothing broth of their PHOs."}
{"text":"*Best Pho on the west side*  I cannot believe I did not know this place was closer to me. After many times going to another place and then not having vegetable broth even though it is on their menu I ended up finding this place. I am so glad I stumbled upon this place because I will go here now. I have never had such good customer service. They took the time to go over the menu and tell me what they can customize for my diet. It was a wonderful experience.  The food is delicious as well. This place was also pretty busy which is a good sign...   Customer service A+ Vegan/vegetarian friendly A+ Food quality A+ Atmosphere A+ Quick serve A+  Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"As far as Pho Annie goes I wasn't impressed.  I've never been to the original location and even though it's close to home it definitely wasn't the best pho I've ever had. The broth was overly sweet and I prefer my pho broth to be more on the savory side. I do have to say that when you order double noodles they definitely give you a good portion of noodles. The beef was tough to eat...it was like trying to chew through some dinosaur skin. On the plus side, the beef was plentiful but just tough to eat. I normally like pho but I couldn't even eat half of it. Now the egg rolls were just ok. I probably wouldn't order them again from there. My husband asked if there were potatoes inside of it because of the texture but I am pretty sure there wasn't.   Overall, I wasn't impressed. Location is important but for the cost of a large tai pho, a vermicelli dish and egg rolls for $30 I rather drive a little bit further and get something I know I will love and eat."}
{"text":"The flavors here are exactly like Annie pho1. That's a good thing because then I can reliably order my food. The grilled pork chops were a bit overcooked, but had great marinade. Love that it comes with eggs on the rice.   I've never been fond of their pho broth so I'm apathetic about it. The garlic chicken wings were good as usual. I'll be back for some more food. Heheheheheheheh."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's sparkling clean, great service and they can make a yummy rare beef pho!!!  Will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely clean and the owner is very nice. I went here twice in one week because I was feeling so under the weather. It's good to know there's a nice and clean Pho restaurant just around the corner from my house. The Pho broth isn't as strong as I'm used to from other places but I can definitely tell things are fresh. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered Bun thit nuong cha gio it was nothing special.      The rice with pork chopped had alot of fat then I am used to but there were two which made up for it.  Instead of the traditional steamed egg loaf they changed it up with an over easy egg which made it kinda of like a loco moco.   As for the beef stew it was a little salty and no baguette to complement the dish.  Too many difference in the dishes.  I guess if the name of fusion was on their retail front I wouldn't had all these expectations.   Average"}
{"text":"Really great service here. Excellent food! Most definitely my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas. Richard is an amazing server, he knew what was up when I asked for the \"spicy\" condiments. He brought out my kitchen to me... fish sauce, birds eye chili (Thai chili), pepper flakes, and smoked pepper flake in oil."}
{"text":"Been to many Pho restaurants, but this Pho at Pho Annie 2 here's just plain no flavor taste like water down broth. The pho also lacks noodles there being tight with the noodles, also the steak in the pho was rubbery I'm glad they only put 2 slices in pho  what the heck cheap. The pho was not greatest very disappointing after craving Pho for awhile. Service not bad. I won't be coming back here I will continue to look for great Pho."}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house. The food and service was good. Not the best pho ive had in Vegas, but pretty darn good. The pork chop dish with egg was very good as well. The chop had a nice flavor, and the eggs were done well. The broken rice wasnt bad, but i wouldve preferred some \"unbroken\" rice. Overall, the restaurant is neat, the food is good. Ill be back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"This is an example of how to loose a customer on first impression. I made the mistake and asked for disposable chop sticks instead of their house chop sticks. The waiter thought it was funny and said is it because I'm white and don't want black chop sticks. Are you kidding me, than he brings my pho bowl last like he forgot my order. Don't know what his problem is but I will never be back here. Not only that but all my friends that came to dinner also didn't appreciate his customer service and they won't be back as well. Sorry I didn't leave you a tip, figured if leave your place a review instead."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Went at around 2 the place was empty. The service was pretty typical for a place this but our waiter did keep our glasses of water full which is nice."}
{"text":"This is more of a 4.5 stars rating. Almost as good as the original Pho Annie. Clean, nice, and fast.  I'd write more but I think yelp took down my last 3 reviews so I stopped caring about writing longer reviews."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family last night. The food is excellent, service was great and the place is beautiful.  Recommend this to anyone who want to get there Pho on!!!"}
{"text":"i enjoyed it here.  new and clean.  prices were good too and food was very tasty.  i had their pork w/ broken jasmin rice and egg and it came in a huge bowl.  generous portions - definitely.  overall, i will be back.  we went about 630pm and luckily beat the crowd, bc it did get packed and the only unfortunate part was there were only 2 waiters.  they tended to us, but again, we were there when it was a little less crzy.  one thing I wish they would change is there choice of plates.  they have ridges and it's a pain when trying to use a spoon or a fork and its not smooth - just a little annoying, but food is good!"}
{"text":"Was hesitant to try a new pho place...but the chicken curry noodle soup was absolutely amazing!! I have never seen this in a menu before and it is a must try for curry lovers! Not only was the broth delicious but the chicken just fell of the bone! I loved how clean the place was too. Definitely coming back again...:) (Oh my goodness so full right now...haha)"}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews but this place I did not like at all. I got chicken pad Thai and the pad Thai was okay but the chicken looked raw. It was so chewy I couldn't eat it and immediately lost my appetite.  The only reason I gave two stars is for the service. The lady there was really nice and she was fast with the food."}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  Set in a strip mall with lots of parking.  The place seems very low traffic but  don't let that fool you, the food is great and the prices are reasonable.  The service is also very prompt and courteous.  I'll be eating here often since it's close."}
{"text":"Best Pho in LV hands down, even better then the original pho Annie ! Love the chicken curry pho and beef stew pho. The owner Eric is the man!"}
{"text":"A pho place way outside of Chinatown (where most pho places are located) and conveniently only a few minutes away from home. This is my favorite place to eat! The place is very clean and service is great here and I always have the same, awesome waiter. Dinner time is a lot busier, the kitchen seems a little understaffed during that time. However, the food is always worth it.  For the noodle soup, I usually get beef ball and rare steak. The soup is flavorful and the surface isn't coated with oil like all the other pho place I go. Also, when you let the soup sit, you don't see that usual separation of powders and liquids. So the soup is top-notch! For the rice dishes, I prefer the pork chops, it's a little extra work, but the meat is very juicy! It's always beautifully present with rice, sauce, veggies, a side of soup and an optional fried egg.  Would highly recommend you try this place if you're looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and I was nothing but impressed, you can definitely tell that everyone working here does their best to serve you. I ordered one the Steak Pho bowls and it had a way bigger portion of noodles and meat that most other places. For sure coming back!"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas about 9 months ago and have been exploring the neighborhood near my office for lunch options. This place is one place that's stuck. I love pho and they're close-by, clean, friendly and delicious. The decor is modest which makes it feel very mom & pop. The staff is super friendly. They have a pretty good variety on the menu but I find it hard to stray from good ole pho. It's definitely my go-to lunch place."}
{"text":"Nice place first one in the neighborhood it's big and the booths in the back are massive. The service was good and so was the food. It's one of the only pho place I've been to that gives you more than enough lettuce to wrap your egg rolls. The pho was good and I would come back for it everything came out hot and fresh. The verimeccilli was great as well although I was not a fan of the mint mixed in the lettuce and the roasted green onions but I just picked it out and it was great I would definitely come back here although I really wish they had a kids menu since our 6 year old is not adventurous at all."}
{"text":"Look, I work from home and some days, I REALLY miss having co-workers and standing around the coffee machine, or going to grab pho for lunch.  So, in order to mimic that, I grabbed my b/f and popped over to Pho Annie for a faux work lunch.  We sat down and were greeted (or not really greeted) by an older Vietnamese man.  I told him we wanted the spring rolls and two pho tai's and he made me point them out on the menu..bit of a language barrier, which is a good thing in a pho restaurant really, so +1 for authenticity.  The spring rolls (fresh, not fried) were very good!  They had that crisp freshness like someone just picked the herbs and rolled that puppy up in the kitchen, just for you!  The soup came out, but they forgot to give us the accoutrements (the bean sprouts and such), so I had to ask for them.  No bigs.    The broth was good, the beef was rare, and my tummy was happy.  The end.  Sidebar - I just realized that I actually went to the other location - the one on Rainbow...probably the same. :)"}
{"text":"My go to place at least once a week! Great customer service and the food is delicious. I live the veggie pho with beef broth. Yum!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place. Meat smelled funky and vegetables were old! Will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"We came here because my Korean friend said it was very good. I think I am going to have rethink my notion of listening to him, or any Korean for that matter. So far, I have been less than impressed with both of my Korean friends telling me about a really good Pho place. Too West of Vietnam I guess. Maybe it's safer to ask them about Siberian food. That was cold. Doh. Ok, onwards to the pho.  The service is very friendly, the place is very clean as well. Yes, if you think you've stepped into an American restaurant, you are not mistaken. It really is a Vietnamese pho place. The pho however is ok. The broth is clean but it's not as tasty as I want it. Not Pho-ey enough. Man, you got to reek of pho in your hair, skin, and clothes, like you do when you leave a great pho place, to tell that it must have been a good pho place. Come on, you know it's true. Stereotype my bott.  But, if you don't want to drive down to Chinatown, then I guess this is ok and you just wanted some pho in you."}
{"text":"The curry chicken noodle pho and spring rolls were bomb! The ingredients were super fresh. I doctored up the pho just so with the various accoutrements and it was delicious. I'll be back soon to try more! Thanks Richard!"}
{"text":"I loved the first Annie Pho, now I love this one even more because it is a block from my house. Same great food and service. They honestly make the best pot stickers I have ever had. Best thing about this second location is that it is more spacious than the first one.  I have been happy with anything I have ever ordered and will continue to only have Pho here."}
{"text":"Very nice and pro service. We had chicken curry noodle and beef pho. Both were better than all vietnamese restaurants i know. Both soups were huge, do not over order."}
{"text":"I'm a a hunt for that one pho place we're going to be stopping by once a week.  This isn't it.  Sadly since it's the closest one to us.   Not bad.  Clean space.  This is located in a small plaza.  The broth is very Americanize.  You don't taste much excitement in the broth like you would in the authentic pho.  I only gave a 3 stars, because of the cleanliness and hospitality."}
{"text":"This place by far one of the best pho places on the Southwest side of town. The owners are super nice and friendly and know us by name everytime we come here. They are speedy on their to-go orders which is also convenient. I have yet to find a dish from this place that i didnt like. If you want a nice simple meal with decent prices this is the place to go!  My go tos for this place is the rare steak pho, chicken pho, and of course the egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"Wow just a few blocks from my place and the food is really tasty. Love the pork chops dish and the chicken bbq over rice. The beef stew was rich in flavor too.  Good service. Clean restaurant. Love this place and welcome to the neighborhood!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food!! Consistent with great quality service and food!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! When the other Pho Annie is super crowded or we are just in the area craving pho, we come here. Same menu/food BUT I can honestly say, this place is a  lot better. I'm gunna give you every reason to come to this place.  This place is the CLEANEST Vietnamese restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. High FIVE for never a sticky table, utensils are sparkling clean, never any water residue on any any of the plates and bowls. I've had times where at different Pho places, I've had to use lemon on my utensils before I used it. Love how they have the original Sriracha bottles and Hoisen sauce in its original container at each table. Thank God there's no crusty stuff on the bottles either! This place is spotless! Clean floors and clean bathrooms.   The owner Eric is way cool! He always offers us the remote control for the TV in case we wanna change the channel or put the volume up. Lol So Nice! We didn't wanna inconvenience anyone by changing anything tho. Good lookin out Eric!   Let's get down to the food. I feel like the portions are a little bigger than he other Pho Annie. That's a plus! They want you to leave fulfilled. The soup for the Pho is good as it is without any alterations of any sriracha or hoisen sauce.. You know what that means?!? That soup is on point! YEE! I forget what rice plate # I eat here but its the one with the pork chop and the 2 eggs over rice. MAN! I love it! Even my kids always ask me for mine when they order soup! Our server Ken is always nice when we're there. Always polite and checks on us all the time in case we need something... He is very persistent but not in a bugging way.   Gotta give this spot 5 stars, I'd give more if I could. You won't find a Pho spot like this one (especially in China town). I'm gunna rave about this place cuz our experience here is always welcoming and pleasant.    We will ALWAYS be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch after church! always friendly staff! Try the Vietnamese Coffee its super good! My daughter also agrees!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch Friday...TGIF because it wasn't crowded. Greeted quickly. Young staff was courteous, friendly and eager to serve. We had the the Pho #16 and bun (some kind of beef noodle salad) it was good, but be modest on the sauce because for us, it was a little on the sweet side. I'm a new transplant from the bay and have been trying different places in my area. This will definitely be one of my spots I come to."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from here, and finally decided to go here for dinner. We came here early May 2017 just before they renamed it and made a few changes. We were VERY impressed with the food, the quality, the service and the prices.  We ordered the curry and the seafood and it was soo yummy.  We did not leave hungry at all.  We will definitely be back.  I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Great bowl of soup!! Staff was on point, very friendly and attentive... look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 58/100***  Last time I had Pho was about a year ago when we still resided on the other side of town. I was definitely psyched when I found out Pho Annie 2 was opening so close to our place.  I have not had the pleasure of dining in but have ordered to go a couple of times. The restaurant is clean and minimally decorated. The owners are very welcoming and ordering is fast and efficient.   Our favored dish is the Pork chop with broken rice and egg $9.99 downright comfort food. It's perfect with charred edges yet still very tender and delicious. 5/5  Grilled pork with vermicelli $8.99 well marinated pieces of pork with noodles topped with fresh cucumbers, mint, bean sprouts and peanuts with a side of egg rolls 5/5  Garlic butter chicken $9.99 was a disappointment, it was very bland. Though it was perfectly crisp, the taste just didn't come thru. It was almost like they forgot to season it, I wonder if that was the case. The garlic pieces were good but it sorely lacked salt and pepper. 2/5  Eggrolls $5.99 are always great! an order comes with 4 pieces, I can eat these for days 5/5  I have yet to try their Pho, I am waiting until this Vegas heat lets down to try Philip T's recommendation Chicken Curry Noodle soup, can't wait though!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!!!  I usually go to china town for my Pho cravings, but this place is much more convenient and SO GOOD!  Extremely clean restaurant and very attentive service.  The food...PERFECT!  I had Pho Tai and spring rolls, per usual.  The broth was full of flavor and when I ordered extra beef, there was actual extra beef!!!!....at other restaurants I can barely tell the difference. The spring rolls with peanut sauce were perfection! They also brought my two year old a tiny bowl with simply noodles and broth! She LOVED it! We'll definitely be back...soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the original Annie Pho for a long time because I use to work over there. This location is now down the street from my house I could walk there. I always get the Pho Tai and it's always consistent and tasty.  Annie herself and her staff  is so nice and very attentive. Overall, both the food and customer service are great."}
{"text":"Tried this place, as I am new to the area, and this BY FAR is the best Pho in town! The broth is amazing! And the service is great! I will definitely be Visting again very soon! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"im probably one of their best customers at pho annie 1.. so i expect the same when i walked into this second location they opened. i will say this the food is exactly the same so kudos for keeping the same food and menu.  They have made the neccesary changes so for that thank you im always loyal to you guys for your great food!!"}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time here and I loved it!  Was able to try their new broken rice pork chop with wrapped shrimp paste. It's DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite pho place in town! The facility is always clean and well kept, plus servers are always friendly and accommodating. Their chicken wings are to DIE for. I'm addicted! My favorite dishes here are the chicken wings, their chicken pho, and their grilled pork chops. I love it here, and I usually come by once a week. Sometimes twice. This is definitely my go-to place when I'm hungry. 10/10 for this place."}
{"text":"The owner is always nice and likes to explain dishes to people who may be unfamiliar to them so that they don't accidentally buy something they don't like. The food is really good and they're pretty quick about getting orders out to customers. Overall really great! Love coming here :)"}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese for miles. Always the best & consistent flavors, their spring rolls are some of the very best you'll have and their customer service is exemplary. Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Honestly, not sure how this is the second location of this place. We had dinner here recently and were highly disappointed. The service was fine--a little pushy to leave--but fine. The food was not good.   We ordered a fried rice plate, egg rolls, pho and some noodle soup thing. It was bland was not good at all! The fried rice was basically steamed rice with over cooked egg and almost raw chicken in it. It had no flavor and while the chicken may have been cooked it didn't feel like it in my mouth and looked raw. The pho was flavorless too and needed a lot of soy sauce. Overall no good. I will not be back and will not recommend it to anyone ever! Gross. The egg rolls were burnt and blah."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this place after wet and wild. We ordered rare steak pho, combo pho, pad Thai, and egg and spring rolls. It's was good"}
{"text":"Went in to order pho to go yesterday. The two men at the front desk gave GREAT customer service and were so friendly. I ordered Pho Tai and it was so yummy. Definitely recommend and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best service of any Vietnamese restaurant we've been to! We never have to ask to have our water refilled, at some other joints we literally have to wave a flag to get service. We've tried the garlic chicken wings, egg rolls, beef stew, pho, bun bo hue, vermicelli bowls.  Everything has been really tasty, the exceptional item is the beef stew.  The broth is thick and hearty, and the brisket is tasty and tender.  The bun bo hue is just okay, lacks the depth of flavor of some of the other places.  We like this place since it's usually not too busy and it's closer than Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I would say this is only best Pho restaurant at the west las vegas. Even better than china town as well. Finally have a nice restaurant close to my area.  Always come back. I usually eat chicken wings and beef noodle. Grilled pork are very good too. Once you eat, you will never for this restaurant. If you don't want to wait, call for order to go will be a good option too. I hope Pho Annie 2 can keep their food and taste standard later on too."}
{"text":"I would strongly recommend this pho restaurant to anyone.  The flavor of the pho has always been great.  The soup for beef and chicken all tasted great.  This establishment is always clean and the service is great."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food that stands up to other pho places around. The restaurant is always very clean and is a fairly quiet environment. There seems to be some inconsistency with the service though. The taller gentleman with the glasses is extremely nice and pleasant to speak with. Then there's the shorter \"tough guy\" who really has no business being in the service industry. The last time my husband and I visited, we got it to go. We were waiting to order when Tough Guy comes out from the kitchen and waves us up and says, \"Alright, whatchu guys want?\" As I start speaking, he literally waves his hand in my face and tells me, \"Stop. She was here first\" then proceeds to yell, \"Hey! C'mon!\" at some other lady (who did come before we did but a) you're the one who brought us up there, b) don't put your hand in my face). Then when it was our turn, my husband had a question about one of the dishes and Tough Guy goes, \"Don't come in here with all these questions, dude.\" I'm sure he thought he was being funny but after he already put his hand in my face, I was ready to walk out but my husband is more tolerant than most and ordered anyway. We've been here many times but have always dealt with Tall Nice Guy. Tough Guy leaves a bad enough taste in my mouth that I'm not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"Really good and hit the spot on this cold day. The restaurant was immaculate and the service was great.   We had been hesitant to try it only because I was still mourning the loss of Macciano's which used to be in this location and I loved it. But anyway, we ordered egg rolls and two chicken dishes and I really enjoyed it. The menu offers a lot of variety and includes not only pho but noodle, rice and vermicelli dishes.    It's very close to us and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"1st time to be here wife loved everything we ordered the pho annie special men it was dabomb!!! Ordered sone eggrolls and fried mackerel. All in all food was great. I rated them all five stars not only because of the food but the service itself. Servers are very fast, warm and very friendly. I would definitely recommend to eat here if you are craving for pho or any vietnamese dishes"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is so tasty. Never a disappointment every time the guy who works here he's probably the owner, but whoever he is he sure was friendly and just awesome. If your looking for some Good pho,clean environment, and friendly people come Here it's the best.. always coming back.. 5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Drove by saw this new shop, decide to eat here. In the middle of the meal, there is a black hair stuck in the tendon.  And the waiter told me is because the raw material, I didn't know cows grow black hair in their tendon. Very disappointed by their attitude, for our Asians I love to see they success in their business. Hope you can improve.  I hope my 7 months pregnant wife won't get sick out of this.  Sigh"}
{"text":"I got the #17 ($7.25) and it was delicious! The broth was just right, and as usual the lime, bean sprout, &basil complements it (not a spicy fan so jalapeno isn't on the list). The rare steak, brisket, and rice noodles were nice and tender.   I have been to Pho Annie 2 a few times and always got excellent service!   I will be back and recommending this place to whomever I can!"}
{"text":"My family's to go to place whenever we crave pho! Great service! Great food! Friendly staff! Must try :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time as it was closer than my usual spot we tend to frequent for Pho. That was a mistake. From when we got there there was only one other diner eating which wasn't the end of the world except that the staff was sitting down doing nothing.   When we came in a rather brusque individual told us where we could sit and then brought us menus. When he came back to deliver our waters he asked how we were doing and left before I could answer apparently not interested in the answer to the question he had just asked. Again short with the order taking and dropping the food off which did come very quick.  The pho itself was not very good. The broth was very sweet almost to the point of inedible. I decided to try and doctor it up so I could eat my meal with my friend. None of the containers on the table were labeled so guessing was the name of the game. Also the brisket I had with was overly fatty, some of the pieces just being fat.   Over all not impressed and due to the super sweet food won't be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much. Its close to home and convenient. I ordered the Beef Chow Fung and it was surprisingly delicious. Try it. You might like it. I'll come back here again."}
{"text":"I have found the perfect pho restaurant to meet my craving during my lunch break!  It's located a mere 5 minutes from my work, which makes it perfect! This is by far one of the cleanest pho restaurants I've been to next to Side Street Pho & Grill. They have half of the restaurant divided with booths and the other half divided with tables. If you have a larger party, search for seating towards the back.  The service here is on point. They're quick, friendly, and efficient. I usually eat here right when they open (11am), but I did come here once at 12pm and the service was still up to par. They'll let you choose your seating and set you up with appropriate utensils. I love that their soup spoons have the \"hook\" so it doesn't fall into your broth/soup.  I order the rare steak or the rare steak with brisket - both are amazing. The broth here is perfection. I can't think of any other way to stress that enough. The only thing is that they don't have cilantro in their pho, but you can ask for some and they'll give you a small plate so you can add as much as your heart desires. The pricing for pho is average; ranging from $8-9 I believe.  I just love love love how their service is. I only get an hour break, so I'm in and out of here with time to spare. I'm becoming a regular here and I have no shame in that."}
{"text":"I almost wished there were more noodles, but the pho broth is some of the best I have ever tasted. Beyond that, the restaurant staff were incredibly friendly and the service was fast and generous."}
{"text":"Tried Pho Annie 2 for the first time.  We ordered spring rolls for appetizers.  They were flavorful.  We ordered shrimp pho and vegetable pho.  Loved the broth.  A nice sized bowl and full of noodles, and ingredients.  Priced fairly at $7.99 or $8.99 with shrimp.    Service was excellent.  Water glasses were never empty.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegas pho shop has came through again. This time with super clean chicken and veggie noodle soup. Last time I had the vegan broth with veggies. Love the healthier options... alas I am a meat guy and will return to my pho dac biet next time :) again just so thankful for pho annie 2 and the whole crew here... Eric jason rich Hua you guys rock."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since it is so close to our house. I've heard good things about the other location but have never been there. Usually, my family goes to Jenni Pho but this might be our new go-to Vietnamese restaurant. Walking in, the interior is simple but well designed and also clean. Servers were very fast and helpful. There is also a pretty good sized menu. We ordered spring rolls with shrimp but that was just OK to me. We also got the pork chops with rice which was a good portion compared to other places. Last thing we got was the pho dac biet which was also a good size. Owner Annie was nice and chatted with us for a bit. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, as long as you stick to what they are good at (Pho, Vietnamese, etc). The Pho was 5 star, the Rice with Pork chop and baked egg was fantastic, etc - however my youngest was scared to try something new and ordered teriyaki chicken which was weird and not good(no one liked it - but who expects teriyaki chicken to taste like you are used to when you are at a Vietnamese restaurant? Other than a 12 year old of course). But we all gave him some of our Pho and other foods and he liked it (even though he is a picky eater).  I have recommended the restaurant to good friends of ours, and they enjoyed it also."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live right dowm the street. We love the fact there is a Pho spot in this area so we dont have to drive all the way to spring mtn whenever we want pho. We've dined here maybe a dozen times since moving to the area. The food is always super fresh, the service is always excellent and the restaurant itself is very clean. Reguardless of the location Annie Pho is one of the top pho spots in vegas so the added plus of being so close puts it over the top. A definite must visit especially if you live in the area (Russell and Grand Canyon)"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular go to's. Eric and the gentlemen who work there ask us how we are doing when it's been a little bit, remember how we like our order, and just are so accommodating. Cleanliness is key, and I have never seen this place dirty or messy. Always enjoyable to see them, and in addition to savoring delicious pho. Nothing like a home feel when you are dining out. I feel good when I leave knowing not only was the meal tasty but it was healthy too!"}
{"text":"I came here with my kids for dinner. We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant was clean which is really important to me. I forgot the server's name but he was nice and attentive. I ordered the fresh spring rolls, well done steak pho (which my kids shared), and rare steak and beef balls pho for me. The broth was delicious! I would definitely come back again with my fam. The food and service was great! No complaints."}
