{"text":"Bon petit resto pour déjeuner. Pas trop lourd, personnel courtois qui voit à ce qu on manque pas de café.  Il ne manque pas de journaux. Convivial."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast on a sunday drive and ate the most awesome bfast dish ever!! I definetly recommend the hot dog dejeuner geant. Service was good but the food was awesome. I would come here time and time again"}
{"text":"Walked in starving at 3 PM, was seated right away, food came quickly. Best poutine of the weekend (and there were many for comparison), and also had some other dishes there. Our waitress did not speak English but that was not a problem (nor expected in Quebec - just giving it as a note). Definitely some good Quebec homestyle cooking, and I would return."}
