{"text":"Went there for lunch and had all you can eat soup and salad.  My salads were not very tasteful and the soup was okay.  My friend ordered a pizza and that too was just okay.  The place is absolutely quaint and cozy but I like tasteful quality meals for a good value no matter how cute the place is.  They have wine and beer tastings that might be worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is just unacceptable.  The food is terrible, especially at the prices. We both ordered steaks, the potatoes were instant, the asparagus was frozen.  My girlfriend's first steak was half a chunk of fat.  The second steak was overcooked.  Service was decent, not great.  First time and last.  At least now we know."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always delicious and you really can't beat the prices. I have gotten the quiche of the day several times (haven't had a bad combination yet!) and their pizzas are great as well. Both the quiches and the personal pizzas come with soup AND salad for only $10, which is a great deal. The creamy tomato basil soup is wonderful. They also do wine specials often ($5 glass nights and 1/2 price bottle nights), which is always nice...and they give you A LOT of wine in your glass. Service has always been good when I've been here. My only complaint is that it is freezing inside...bring a jacket!"}
{"text":"the Ichabod pumpkin beer, which is flavored with natural cinnamon, pumpkin, and nutmeg, is great!  The food here is excellent and they use fresh ingredients, the stone building the place is in, which was once a railroad depot, it a very nice environment. service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place specially during the Christmas parade.  Great variety of cheeses."}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  A hidden gem in Cabarrus County.  Fish taste fresh and well prepared!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"they have wonderful in house made cheese, great wine list, very comfy setting the outside veranda is nice and home like feeling"}
{"text":"En route to Georgia we had a layover in kannapolis. We went here and had a lovely meal. I was quite impressed with the crawl fish cakes and the tomato basil soup. The other parties in my group got salads and salmon.  Both looked great. Other reviewers mentioned that they had problems with the service; we had no problems with that. Our server was congenial and went out of our way to keep is happy. Only thing service wise was the fact that the entrees arrived a bit early. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way!  Great service, prices and atmosphere.  Had the blackened tilapia, smoothered chicken, and chicken roulade. Salads are fresh.  Desserts were the best!  Coconut cake, key lime pie and tiramisu.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"If u like sipping wine and bad food I guess this place is ok. I wasn't impressed at all. I got the cheeseburger was more bread and cheese than anything else. Ordered a side of cheesefries came out burnt on top and raw in the middle. How does that happen. Staff was very nice food was just horrible"}
{"text":"So I was dying to see some minor league baseball and the Charlotte Knights were not in town one week, so I headed up to Kannapolis to watch the Intimidators (owned by the Chicago White Socks...which is cool considering I moved from there last year).  But my GF and I got there an hour early before the gates opened and the gamed started so we wanted something to eat other than hotdogs and 36oz beers.  So we headed into Kannapolis and just happened upon the Old Stone vino bistro.  With its cute little deck out front, it was a nice way to have a drink and a little bite to eat without the drama of the baseball scene.  The owner was running around making sure everyone was taken care of and my GF and I asked a gentleman about a dish he was eating only to find out it was the owners husband and quite nice and informative about how the place got started and what they were planning on for the business food and entertainment wise.  Beer selection is good, plus they had a nice special that day.  I tend to find smaller towns lack too depth with beer selection, but not the case with Old Stone.  They have daily specials like free wine tastings every Tuesday night and Thursdays $3 Beer Day with a selection of over 35 beers.  They also have live music on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, though I think they are moving to doing that more nights of the week.  So if you are up in that \"neck of the woods\" I recommend you check them out...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an evening on the patio with good food and guitar music!  I think they have continued to increase their quality and menu selections.  Finished our evening with great coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"We enjoy the cheese plates, drink selection and overall menu. But the best part is the quaint little rooms in this converted house.  Pick the room that suits your mood, kick back and enjoy.  It's the one eatery in K town with an atmosphere above onion rings and bowling pins."}
