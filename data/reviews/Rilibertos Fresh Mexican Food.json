{"text":"Delicious food! Huge burritos, stuffed with tons of meat. Really enjoyed Pico too. 

A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness that these guys came into the East Valley! They just took over the old Rolibertos that was absolutely disgusting for years. The other few Filibertos around aren't a whole lot better. This place is actually pretty damn good! It's easy to think that every single one of these places is exactly the same but each one has just a touch different flare to their menus and this place is no exception. The prices are much more reasonable than Filibertos, and the actual spices that they put in their products make the food tastes so much better. Thumbs Up Guys!"}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely recommend the churros! Only .99 and fresh! The fries are also better than Roberto's, in my opinion."}
{"text":"You might be better off ordering inside than using the drive thru. I don't know if they rehired some of the staff from this building when it housed A&W/Long John Silver, but they move equally as slowly.

Pull up to the window, turn off the engine, and turn up the music because you'll be there for a while. What earns them an additional star is the fact that the ladies at the window are friendly. 

The food is only slightly better than Roberto's, there's nothing much to say about it."}
{"text":"They're street tacos are delicious!!   So is the carnay asada combination plate. The food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Me acabo de mover de Phoenix  y extranaba mucho la comida de alla hasta q Encontr este restaurante,me recuerda mucho a Arizona,ahora no puedo dejar de comer Les recomiendo mucho la adovada y los tacos de pescado tambien si Les gusta comer adentro siempre esta muy limpio el comedor y los ba√±os"}
{"text":"Chilie rellenos, rice and beans are fantastic. Also their carne asada street tacos taste wonderful. They're food is always fresh, also the salsa bar is great."}
{"text":"My favorite food from this place, mini tacos, super nachos and the asada fries. Every time I visit is super clean. Customer service is great! I definitely recommend this place !! yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food, better than Rivas and Robertos imo. I've been getting the potato egg and cheese burrito + pico + guac, and it's all fire."}
{"text":"I was recommend here for a quick bite and not too thrilled. The problem is what you see here, not carne asada though that's what I asked for. It was a combo and both burritos were the same. No meat!!  The service was good though and guy very polite."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chile relleno plate which comes with 2 rellenos with a side of rice and beans. The beans and rice were just like any other place. The rellenos were decent. Not spicy at all which was great because my bf is sensitive to spicy food! I love that they have grilled onions at their salsa bar!! They gave the food extra flavor. And the salsas are good too. This place is definitely good enough to come back to. I'm looking forward to trying some of their burritos."}
{"text":"I tried the steak & eggs breakfast burrito and paid. $.89 extra for the potatoes. The burrito was good and definitely filling!!! There was plenty of meat, cheese, eggs, and potatoes. I went thru the drive thru so the hot sauce they gave me was pretty hot but I will get the green next time and of course hot!!!

They actually taste better & fresher than Roberto's. So this will be my new to go spot for breakfast!!!! I'm a happy greedy girl.

Sorry I forgot pics but will upload next time."}
{"text":"Gave them a shot hoping they'd b better then robertos  , not ! Burrito was  full of carne asada but that was about all no rice r  beans then had to add sour cream and cheese for 99 cent each. Ask for the pico on the side to my surprise didn't receive it at all only to also notice that they also didn't  give me my change n the drive thru. Carne asada was ok but my burrito was cold which i do not like ,  wouldn't waste my drive coming here stick to something in my area"}
{"text":"So far everything I have had here has been good, the service is good and they are quick. You can taste the better quality of the meats they use compared to other similar restaurants in the surrounding areas. Definitely will continue to come to here for good fast Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the place is kept clean. I have been here about 3 times and love the taste of the food. Would definitely recommend this place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was good and the atmosphere was great. The cashier with the green eyes was awesome and super friendly."}
{"text":"I been here twice. I'm not gonna say the food is bad. It's good. Nothing crazy, but it's good. Only complain the last time I was there was that there's only 2 people working. The cook and the cashier. When I walked I cashier was on the bathroom I guess. So I waited at least 10 mins. All in all it took me about 30+ mins to walk out with a burrito and some carne asada fries. I'm not gonna say I won't go back. Maybe one day when it's one of those days when you just don't know what else to get."}
{"text":"This Rilibertos is the worst. They locked the door from the outside and this lady ignored me the whole time. So maybe drive thru then? Heck no this lady was just there taking her time doing God knows what and again, Ignored. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I like that this place is a rare 24 hour joint in NWLV. This is my second time eating here, and it's OK. The guacamole is awesome along with the salsa bar. I custom made a burrito since I'm vegan. It was ok and very bland. The red sauce was delish. However, the green sauce was way too salty. My wife had fish tacos and said they were also bland and needed seasoning. She said the fish had way too much breading and could barely taste the fish. They have a daily special for the weekdays and a 2.99 daily breakfast burrito. I'll come here when I'm craving late night Mexican to support a small business. Other than that, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Fresh-made Mexican food, available 24/7, at extremely reasonable prices. Whenever I'm near Nellis, it's hard to resist a stop by Rilibertos! Despite the similar name, this place has no affiliation with Robertos and has WAY better food and service.

The breakfast burritos are a favorite item, ordered all the way, packed with ham and dipped in their awesome salsa verde- and it's like $3. Their regular burritos are also good, but my guy tends to order their plates. They have late HH discounts and coupons to make their already low prices even lower- if you spend more than $7/person, you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers."}
{"text":"In the Mojave area you got your Robertos, your Robertizos, your Rilibertos ... it's a lot to keep track of. 

This place is consistently very good, and I'm even more of a fan now that Robertos jacked their prices way up all across town. Now this place is roughly the same price, but the food quality is a small step up from Robertos.

If you like a mostly meat-filled burrito this is the place to get it, for a fairly reasonable price of about 6.50 after tax given the size and quality. They also have some daily $1.50 rotating specials on weekdays and street tacos are always $1.50 each (and pretty good if on the small side). 

Open 24 hours but I have not been here in the wee hours so I dunno if that's the lobby or just the drive-thru overnight"}
{"text":"Shredded beef tacos were amazing, good service! We be back the next time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Their food is 100% authentic and always delicious. I love their breakfast burrito and carne asada fries. Absolutely recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco spots, they offer carne asada street tacos that are so flavorful, I drive from the other side of town almost weekly for their street tacos & my husband loves their carne asada fries. Do be prepared to wait a little bit because the food is always fresh but it's definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"The food has NO flavor!!!!! Not coming back here. Adobada has no flavor cheese is all dry salsa is horrible the bread for tortas is even bad... disappointed"}
{"text":"After a long day at work and then volunteering it's nice to have a great street taco especially when you can go through a convenient 24hr drive thru. I ordered 1-chorizo, 1-Cabeza and 1- pork al pastor. The clear winner in my book is the chorizo. They definitely hit the spot after my long day."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and it has never disappointed!  The street tacos are loaded, with several meat options to choose from.  The burritos are the size of a newborn baby, I haven't been able to finish one of them yet.  My favorite of the burritos is the machaca and egg.  Definitely make sure you have a ton of napkins around, I made the mistake of trying to eat it as a passenger in the car; my clothes got the brunt of the over stuffed burrito!  They also have a ton of combination plates with rice and beans that range from a tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and more.  

I gave up on Roberto's a long time ago because the quality has suffered for years.  Riliberto's has a similar menu, but the quality is far superior, and they have street tacos, which you can never go wrong with!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple if times, the food is alright. But only been there at night while a little tipsy. So I can't be harsh lol"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Close to my house and open 24 hours. Great daily specials. A must try."}
{"text":"Place is fairly new and conveniently opened 24/7. They have really good selection of food as well as a kids menu. Daily specials. Which is great. I like that every time I have been here the food is always made fresh to order, even when going through the drive thru. Fries are crispy. Not stale or soggy. The horchata and pineapple water are very good. The kids are served an organic / low calorie (40) / gluten free fruit drink. Which is way better than soda packed with sugar anywhere else and my son loves their churros."}
{"text":"Tasty street tacos and a nice salsa bar. Cheap and delicious and I would definitely recommend. I had the chorizo and pollo asado."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible service. We ordered the street tacos. We had fish and carnitas. The carnitas were ok. The fish was the Worst Ever! They gave us pieces of skin with no meat in it. It was all fried and oily. Purely disgusting. Please avoid this place. You better off at del taco or Taco Bell. McDonald's is right across the street and the have better fish. Terrible restaurant period. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect on our first visit but they're food was amazing. I had the carne asada burrito with pico and guac, hubby had the street tacos. In foodie terms: the tortilla had that perfect texture and warm creamy starch flavor, the meat was well trimmed and seasoned, salsas and guac were we'll balanced and flavorful. The restaurant was very clean and welcoming. We went for dinner yesterday and will probably go back again today. Sooo good."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food late at night and they are open 24 hours and it's fresher food than Roberto's. The prices are good for the amount of food they give you. I had the Huevos rancheros and they where amazing and all for 6 dollars and some change. They also do delivery you can find them on Post mates."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada street tacos which comes with 5 tacos. The meat was flavorful and juicy. I am happy with this place and it's the second time that I've been here.  The Horchata is so good and I can tell that they make it in house. Looking forward to going back for more. Go hungry because the street tacos are filled with a lot of meat...at least, the carne asada ones are :-)"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Literally ordered a carne asada quesadilla well done, looked sooo good until I found out my tortilla had molding spots and my meat was chewy as hell. And YEAH I SAID MOLD . Lost appetite and my money. I knew this place was bootleg style of Roberto's. Like are you serious, if I can give it 0 stars I would sucks I can't. DONT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has no professionalism my order was incorrect I called to tell them once I got to my destination and was told \"No I saw my Cook prepare your order and it was correct . Excuse me it definitely was not correct and how dare you imply I'm making this up its Tacos not that serious to lie about it , Will Never go back lost all respect that's probably why the Letter grade was a B not A bad business is what that B stands for ."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about ordering, I've never heard of this place before and it seemed like some strange knockoff of Robertos. I should have trusted my initial instinct. I ordered a carne asada taco, a taco de al pastor and some asada fries. The tacos were both asada which were served as gray unseasoned meat.

The fries were also unseasoned, although that's particularly common it was still disappointing. They were served as a layer of fries and gray, bland meat on the bottom followed by miniscule layer of guac and sour cream. A final layer of melted shredded cheese was thrown on top. When attempting to eat the entire layer of cheese came off together as if I was peeling the cheese of some cheap pizza."}
{"text":"We tried everything on the street taco menu with exception of lengua (tongue) and enjoyed it all! The wait was not too bad and the restaurant seemed clean. The fish taco is an area of improvement, at least in the street taco category. My favorites were the chorizo tacos and my husband loved the Cabeza- fatty and flavorful. The salsa verde was also excellent, as was the horchata. We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Omg! Delicious food, never too busy...I love that it's open 24/7...as long as there is good service there I will always return"}
{"text":"The quality of meat sauces everything is excellent! the pricing is more reasonable, and the service is great!!! We've been coming to this place for over 2 years now and we have yet to have a bad experience!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here on multiple occasions.  Spicy nachos, carne asada burritos, rolled tacos, and street tacos.  Pretty big portions of food, especially the nachos. Prefer here over Roberto's down the street. Drive thru late nights after work so there's usually no line. I usually see the same woman working the window and she is very friendly so I like to leave a few bucks for tip.  Overall it's a really nice Mexican spot with good food, especially if you lose money at Boulder station and want to feel happy again."}
{"text":"awesome food for a great price so much to chose from had the #13 2 chilli rellenos w rice and beans only $7.59 couldn't even finish it... chips are fresh hot and delish... salsa bar tasty and hot yummy great experience for our first time new place open 24hrs and have a drive though too Thanks for the bomb food"}
{"text":"I have been going somewhere else for Asada fries then I found rilibertos spicy California fries and I swear I have been here like 10 times in 2 weeks I love it so much! Best loaded fries ever"}
{"text":"First time here for me. Ordered beef enchilada plate at the drive thru.

They got the order wrong--gave me cheese enchiladas instead.  And the cheese was really salty.  Otherwise not bad, and decent portions for the price."}
{"text":"Cool and simple. The tocos were cool and tasteful. The people that work there are very supportive and sweet"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! 
The first time I went here I got the 1.29 street tacos! And I went today and got the chimichanga plate...who wouldn't want a deep fried burrito? Hahaha. 
I hope they open up more locations because Nellis @ Bonanza is a bit far from where I live!"}
{"text":"It's decent, tried many different things nothing is really to brag home about and a little over priced"}
{"text":"Thisbis a solid lil spot beat el pastor tacos !!!"}
{"text":"I always passed by this place because it's right by moms house and everyday of dropping my daughter off and picking her up I would say I will try it someday. But never did because it always seemed sorta sketchy for some reason. But today was the day that I finally tried it I said to myself let's see if this is better than roberto's and guess what it is 100000000 times better!
I tried the spicy nachos with no pico de gallo and they were so delicious! I love going to robertos as my parents do too, but we could all agree this was waaaay more better and more delicious and the employees are actually waaaaay nicer than robertos employees. 
It is safe to say, I will be coming here more often"}
{"text":"I really like their California fries and the horchata it reminds me when I lived in San Diego, i would really recomend to anyone who likes good Mexican food California style, the service was fast on drive thru and the lady was really attentive"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!!!   I have 3 kids and each of them lived their meal. The place was clean and the food tasted really fresh. The fish tacos were a hit with our family as well as the California fries.  Also the portions were huge and we left with lunch for tomorrow. Definitely come by and try it out."}
{"text":"I  read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. The rolled tacos were very tasty. The chili rellano platter was very good, there was cheese, guacamole and creme on top, the salsa bar had several nice salsas.
The ladies who worked there were very cordial.
I will return, an inexpensive menu with delicious very generous portions."}
{"text":"And, again, I forgot pictures!!! I will catch on soon.
We eat here frequently. We are a house divided. Our adult children prefer Robertos. We're older and have more money, so we win, unless they are treating. If you have adult children, then you know that we mostly have Rilibertos.
We always get drive though. Honestly, my husband gets drive through. I get served at home, because I'm a pretty pampered wife. The order is always correct; service is pretty fast; and the food is hot.
I ordered the fajita salad. It was more fajita than salad. I loved the onions; well cooked and a nice amount. There was a lot of chicken. Sadly, the pieces of chicken were cut pretty small. It needed more chips or tortillas. I would order this again, but with steak."}
{"text":"I wasnt much of a fan the first time I came through the drive-thru. The wait was ridiculous and my rolled tacos were cold and hard. Months later.... I gave em another shot. This time I tried their chicken tacos special. Packed full of chicken with good flavor, even the rice and beans were tasty.  Went inside this time and had much quicker service and got to sample all of their salsas from the salsa bar. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I've only had there carne asada tacos which were tasty but this place is expensive for no reason and it's best to call ahead to avoid siting in the drive thru for 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Tried this place once and I can't stop coming here! I love their spicy carne asada fries, and horchata. Will continue to come here and will recommend to my other friends!"}
{"text":"we love this restaurant, started coming opening day and haven't stopped. Best breakfast burrito in town, leaved Roberto's in the dust."}
{"text":"Street tacos are the bomb.they have Limon on the condiment bar.and they keep it clean"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always good and everyone is friendly. They have a huge menu so I can always find something I'm in the mood for. Great breakfast menu also!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to eating here since it is so close to my house. But unfortunately I was disappointed. The food here was bland IMHO. The portions were smaller than Rivas. I'm on the hunt for the best Mexican food near me. As of right now my all time favorite is TACOS HUEVOS at Charleston Blvd and Main Street. Their portions are huge, prices are cheaper and the food is VERY flavorful!"}
{"text":"The food here is plain and the service was horrible. The cashier was on her phone the whole time while taking our order. I asked for sour cream on my burrito and did not receive it. I didn't not pay $1.00 extra and not to have any sour cream."}
