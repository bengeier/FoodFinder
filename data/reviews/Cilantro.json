{"text":"The food was only decent and overpriced. The main reason I wouldn't go back is the uncomfortable atmosphere - something is just off."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service is odd, like they're trying to be upscale but haven't got that all figured out. I brought the coaster discount from City Tins, and included that with my credit card when paying the bill. When the check was returned, the coaster was gone but the discount was not applied. Another post said that the owner visits tables but he wasn't anywhere around on a weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"The one time we went here, we were served the \"specialty drink\" from a plastic pitcher that was left out on the counter (not made fresh, not even put in the fridge), our appetizer that was listed without meat (we had a vegetarian with us) had tons of chorizo on it when we got it, the waitstaff was flustered and disorganized, the food was small and overpriced (my dish was pretty decent, but not worth the $), and then to top it off, my friend found a hair in her food, and when she had it sent back to the kitchen, the manager (owner?) of the place came out and tried to accuse her or my wife of planting it (\"that hair looked blonde and no one in the kitchen has blonde hair\" ??!!!). Will never go back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my husband and has a fantastic and delectable experience. Definitely make your reservation for the quaint patio as it feels more like some out of the back streets of Europe then in downtown Calgary. The wine list is extensive and hits all price points. We had the prawns for our appetizer, cooked to perfection and each had a pasta as a main both superb and full of subtle flavors. Everything else coming out of the kitchen we saw looked amazing and often made us question our order, will have to come back for more. Also we shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and my husband hates dessert, we finally found one we can enjoy together, bravo Cilantro."}
{"text":"Cilantro is located in the former location of Rice Cafe.   Party of three at Noon on a Tuesday during \"Xmas break\". Serving lunch, brunch (can't guarantee this will always be during the week) and a lunch buffet from 11am to 3pm. There were four groups of people in a place that serves 17-18 tables. Two waiters that seemed very confident.   Strangely enough our waiter couldn't say how the \"shrimp & eggs special\" tasted as they don't let them taste the expensive shrimp meals. I offered to share a bite as that's a dumb policy.   Lunch and brunch ranges from $9-12 a meal, with the buffet at $7.99.   Ordered the totopos (chips and salsa) for $2. Lime marinated and salted chips with a mild verde salsa and mild-med habenero salsa. Both salsas were thick and creamy. Would recommend as an appetizer.   I ordered a house margarita for $9. Fresh squeezed lime juice, house tequila and Grand Torres on the rocks. Very tasty but could cut the price by $1-2.   For my meal I had the Huevos con Camarones (eggs & shrimp) for $10.  The main portion was scrambled eggs, grilled shrimp, cilantro and tomatoes and I think I saw some small diced onions in there too.  Came with a side of guacamole, black beans with queso fresco, corn tortillas, and the aforementioned habenero salsa.   The shrimp and egg dish was nice and subtle, really highlighting the great flavor of the shrimp. Adding some guacamole and salsa to the mix worked too, but I thought the tortilla was unnecessary and overpowered it. The beans were something of afterthought. Overall a sensible potion, but I would ask them to hold the tortillas and beans unless I was starving. I would definitely have this again and recommend it.   Entrees after 5pm range from $16-22, and I'm looking forward to trying the Carne Asada next time I stop by.   First stop was 4 out of 5.  Slight downward adjustments to their prices, and tasting policies (so they have more knowledgeable wait staff) would bounce that up a star.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their dishes."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Here's what worked: * Wait staff was super-attentive and friendly, even though the place was PACKED by 6:30 pm * Food. We'd order all these things again: guacamole and chips, salad with beet and jicama (great dressing!), veggie tostados, the daily special: pork tenderloin with mole and mashed potatoes, and flourless chocolate cake.  The decor and layout are a little weird, but if you love mole (I do) and are on the West side of Madison, go for it!  Last thing: we went with a Groupon, and you know some restaurateurs can be jerks about that (even though THEY are the ones who agreed to do a Groupon). But the staff and owner were GREAT about having us and our Groupon. That's another bonus IMHO: they're happy to see and serve you, no matter how you got there."}
{"text":"They call themselves \"fine dining\".  I'm not sure I agree with that.  The atmosphere is dull at best.  We went during lunch and had to wait for a table to be cleared (but the restaurant was not even half occupied).  The guacamole was the best thing we ate, though under seasoned.  In fact, all of the food was extremely under seasoned.  Because it was \"fine dining\" there was no salt or pepper on the tables.  It was very much needed.The house margarita tasted similar to pine sol.  All in all, not a good experience.  I do not think I will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"More a medium end Mexican style place.  The flavors are good.  Appetizers are smaller than you'd think.  We had the ceviche special and the guacamole.  I liked the additional of radishes.  I'll use that when I make it myself.  I ordered the chicken enchilada mole.  It was good.  I'd also recommend the Portillo red wine.  It went well with the spice of the food.  Only drawback is the table are small, for 4.  We were always moving things around so that we could find some space and share."}
{"text":"We've been twice. First time we LOVED it...finally a good -- and better than good --- mexican restaurant in Madison. When I say better than good, I mean creative, imaginative, gourmet. 2nd time we kind of looked around a bit more. Food not as good and decor seems confused: it wants to be formal (there are white table cloths) but they should have lighted votives and get rid of the out of place round wicker rotating chairs. This place is so close!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their pear and gorgonzola pizza with pine nuts.  It pairs really nicely with a nice glass of wine. They have a woold burning oven so the pizza is pretty good. I've also tried their capicolla, tomato and pepper pizza. It was good.. but not as good as the pear and gorgonzola.  I love the ambience at Cilantro, both inside and outside on the patio during the summer.  The only downside is that it is hard to find parking around this place. They have very limited parking at the back."}
{"text":"Ok so the food here has been really good but when my mom and I first got here we were treated horribly the service was way below sub standard.... but then when we got seated after waiting about an hour its gotten better but still its shitty service.... good food but they are NOT warm and fuzzy... if we didn't have a coupon we would've left.."}
{"text":"Food: Overpriced but tastes good Service: Lacking  We went here with a Groupon.  Our waitress was not friendly.  She served the food, but that's about it. Our appetizer (chile poblano quesadillas) was brought out cold.  It had clearly been sitting on the line for awhile. It was bland. I had the Tortas de Lenteja ($18).  Which were fried patties of lentils and other veggies served on a plate of tomatillo sauce. It was good, but not spectacular.  My companion had the  vegetarian chile relleno($15).  The pepper was stuffed with tasty assortment of veggies. The accompanying cheese enchiladas were doughy. They looked more like flautas.  Overall, an ok dinner, but the food is not worth the price especially with the poor service.  Also, the chairs are really short. I felt like I was sitting at the kid's table."}
{"text":"We just returned from Cilantro.  What a treat!  This is the type of restaurant you would expect to see in downtown Madison (or Chicago).  Fortunately, the Rick Bayless-trained chef has landed on the west side with such a fine restaurant.    We were thrilled with the experience. The ceviche appetizer was bright and fresh, the spring green and beet salad was perfectly dressed with a lime vinaigrette, the entrée crab cakes were packed with crab, and the enchiladas pescado included fresh fish wrapped in scratch-made corn tortillas and a slightly spicey poblano sauce.  Each dish delicately balanced fresh ingredients and the flavors from Mexico.  Desserts are made on location and the tres leches and caramel flan were as impressive as the appetizers and entrées.    All of this was enhanced by the vibrant artwork, pulse of international music, and translucent window coverings of azure blue and deep magenta.  This is not Tex-Mex, thank goodness!  It is authentic Mexican food and excellent. Finally, Madison has fresh, made-from-scratch Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Since my last review was filtered let me try again.   A couple Thursdays ago I made reservations for 7. I was there on time but there wasn't a table ready so we sat in a tiny lobby bar and ordered Sangria. What we got was a terribly watered down wine. 20 minutes later we were finally seated. Another 20 minutes a waitress finally came to take our order.  I ordered the lamb and my date ordered the carnitas. My lamb was terrible and my dates carnitas were dry and almost inedible.   Nobody asked us to refill our drinks or how we were doing the ENTIRE time. Finally I asked a waiter who was walking by for our bill. The waitress came and apologized for forgetting about us but offered nothing to rectify the situation.   This was a terrible experience and I expected much more for the price. I wouldn't be surprised if this place was closed by summer."}
{"text":"I was hoping to enjoy this restaurant but the food was bland, badly cooked, tasteless, and overpriced.  Service was poor as well.  Also, their restaurant was cold inside.  I know it is winter but if I'm going to a sit-down restaurant I want to enjoy my meal with my coat off!  Several diners were wearing their coats, and that is really not an acceptable thing for a place that tries to bill itself as fine dining.  On the service end, they brought my partner water in a glass that was visibly dirty.  We had to get them to change it, which they did, but it was slow and a hassle and something they should have noticed before serving it.  The waitress then gave us \"a few minutes\" to review the menus but didn't come back for 10 or 15 minutes!  After our entrees were received, there was no check back to see how we liked them until we were halfway through our meal.  Water was never refilled.  This was on a Wednesday, and the restaurant did not seem overly busy.  Serving and host staff seemed to cluster by the front and chat quite frequently.  On to the food.  Oh my.  They brought my partner the wrong entree in error, but he decided that was OK as he had been considering that entree as well.  His entree was roasted chunks of meat - overcooked and very dry and tasteless, to wrap in dry tortillas, with a tiny amount of cactus salad, and a small dish of a bland green sauce.  Everything was bland and flavorless.  The cactus salad was the best thing on the plate, but extremely small so it was more of a garnish really.  I had fish enchilladas with verde sauce, which was one of the specials.  The fish itself was OK, but a bit dry and tasteless - probably overcooked.  The green sauce was just OK - nothing special.  It was served lukewarm.  I ate it, but did not enjoy the dish.  When you are paying $24 for an entree, it should be well-prepared, but all the food was overcooked, dry, and tasteless.  I was hoping to enjoy Cilantro.  I love authentic Mexican food, but this just seemed very sub-par."}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic Mexican. Atmosphere  left something to be desired. Nice to have this choice on west side."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this place, but at the same time, nothing outstanding either.  The service was good, and the patio looks like it would be very nice (it was raining when we were there).  But, the meals that myself and my co-diners had were not excellent for the price charged. These included classic italian fare, and random items such as smoked salmon (presented somewhat sloppily that night), and duck confit salad with banana. Also, the hard surfaces of the smallish dining room reflected a lot of noise, making it hard to hear anyone more than a seat away at the table when it's busy. At a lower price point, or perhaps if we lived in a city with more than a fleeting patio season, I would give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place based on reviews. Some reviews stated that the dishes were overly bland and only accentuated by sauces and the wait staff was below average. I put those reviews aside to take a chance and unfortunately (for my wallet) I listened to my own advice. This place is at best defined as a restaurant that wants to be high class but succeeds at being mediocre. The food was not great, in fact, I'd compare it to Taco Bueno or Taco Cabana. The food is VERY overpriced for what it is. And I mean VERY overpriced. I had a carne asada dish that was cooked as if at a backyard BBQ. The steak was only about 0.5\" thick and when I asked for it medium rare, was delivered cooked well. The inside had  no pink, was tough and had little flavor. I had to drown it in the sauce it was served in to make it chewable. The worst part, it was $24! I ate with my fiance and 2 friends, none of them liked their dishes. My friend had the same carne asada as me and ordered it medium. It was served well done and was so tough she didn't eat 80% of it. We ordered 2 appetizers which were a joke. I ordered a queso fundido which was supposed to be a chiuahuha cheese w/ chorizo and peppers...it was a small dish with solidified cheese and 2 pieces of meat in it. It was $8. My friends ordered a shrimp plate appetizer, for $8...it had 4 small shrimps and some mushy peppers. The only positive thing I can say about this place is the dessert. It was very good, but small. And again, $9. For $9 you could get half a sheet cake at a store, here, you get a piece of cake slightly larger than a vehicles gas cap and a scoop of ice cream.   Now, for anyone who uses or knows what the IMS barter system is, this is for you. This place DOES NOT HONOR IMS DOLLARS!!! We had $150 in IMS dollars and the restaurant neither listed nor mentioned ANY restrictions on them. We had eaten and recieved our bill, given the waitress the IMS dollars and expected everything to be fine. The waitress came back and stated that due to the restaurant having a slow night....only having two parties all day, one of which was an employee and her small party, they would only allow us to pay for HALF of the bill using IMS dollars. This is a flagrant violation of the contract they agreed to and is an insult to the whole system.They are currently being written up for violating the rules and may be kicked out of the system as a result.   Overall, this place is not much better than a chain Mexican restaurant, their food is VERY, VERY overpriced and they have a rather limited menu (total of 8-10 dinner options).   If you want a much better Mexican dining experience I would highly recommend Laredos or  Taqueria Guadalajara on Park St.    I would NOT recommend it to anyone and would be surprised if they were in business 6 months from now."}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet evening two years ago. Service was professional as usual. Heard a customer complaining (rudely) to a waiter that his steak (with special instructions) was taking too long. Server politely replied that he had informed the customer of the time frame - and did so again. Server was extraordinarily polite and handled the situation expertly. Manners people! Show some class, customers! Wonderful food & ambiance"}
{"text":"Oh Cilantro - what happened to you?  Always so reliably cool and good, your time has apparently passed. The night began with such promise - beautiful patio and an interesting wine list full of surprising nice cabs from Napa and Sonoma (you know we love their wines). Things started downhill when several of our wine choices were not available. The server suggested comparable choices at almost double the price.   We must have waited over an hour for our main courses and when they arrived, they tasted old and dry (pasta) and my tenderloin was blue rare inside (ordered med rare). When I went to the ladies room to pass some time Instead of salivating while watching my dinner mates eat their mediocre pasta, I overheard the kitchen staff laughing about the undercooked tenderloin.  Come on, I don't blame kitchen staff for trying to blow off steam - but shut the door!!!   We won't be back. Too bad because I used to love this restaurant - may have to rethink the whole chain."}
{"text":"Meh describes our Cilantro experience perfectly.  The only thing that could probably lure me back would be the guac but I'd order it with a drink and not dinner.    Service was good, our waiter checked on us frequently and kept our beverages full.  We weren't in any hurry but it did 50 minutes for us to get our food, which our waiter apologized for profusely.  The quality of the food was just okay.  Like the previous posters have said, the meat was just okay quality, sides were hit or miss, and the sauces overall were really good.    And yes, the atmosphere is a odd, it's very open space but yet the tables are cramped.  We were sitting in a little table by the bathrooms so we weren't out in the middle of everything.  From where we were sitting we could watch the wait staff and customers struggle to get around tables.      Overall, I think the restaurant has potential, it just needs (a lot of ) refining to make it what it could be."}
{"text":"Cilantro may have the best atmosphere of any Calgary restaurant I've been to. Beautiful dining room with a picturesque patio that we took full advantage of. Outdoor wood tables, creeping vines, fleece blankets, and heated gas lamps make this one of the coziest places I've dined.   We came here for my father's birthday dinner and absolutely everything was on-point. The gentlemen started with some fancy bourbon cocktails that they both enjoyed immensely.I opted to study the extensive wine list, and picked out a lovely sangiovese/chianti that we all enjoyed with our meals.  I ordered the LEMON CONCHIGLIETTE with a substitute non-dairy tomato sauce and I could've licked that bowl clean. The other plates ordered were the CRMR BISON SHORT RIB, NEW ZEALAND RACK OF LAMB, and the FREE RUN ROASTED CHICKEN. Every dish felt very special, had impeccable presentation, and tasted as good as it looked.  Our server was fabulously laid-back and managed to make us all feel very as ease. He handled our table's allergies with complete professionalism and made us very confident in the food we had ordered.   Overall top-notch experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Original menu offerings; great execution of the dishes; excellent service; ample and good selection of wines by the glass We were there for lunch Maz had the mussels with black bean sauce and it was lightly spiced smoky flavourful a delightful change from usual mussel presentations while I had the elk gnocchi with pesto Since a 1/2 portion was offered I took it and a sound choice since this dish is complex and very filling For dessert we shared the peanut butter chocolate pie It was everything it should be with the gm cream a nice accompaniment This is a great small restaurant Ps Even the regular coffee was better than usual offerings and their port/ dessert wine/ grappa selection is very good"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cilantro. It was recommended for it's patio but it was raining during our visit. The interior is kind of dreary and dark. The food was so good! We all ordered pasta, 3 black pepper linguine and chicken and 1 seafood pasta. Spectacular! Waiter was terrific."}
{"text":"My first visit to Cilantro was a success- by BFF and I both ordered vegetarian enchiladas, which were stuffed with zucchini, carrots, mushrooms and onions.  They were delicious, as was the accompanying rice, garnished with, guess what? -wait for it-Cilantro! BFF ordered some sort of signature drink made with lemonade, vodka and cilantro- it was a little on the tart side, but overall very good. For dessert- crepes with plantains and goat's milk-YUM!!  Of course, I love plantains, so go figure.  Lunch for two- 2 beverages, 2 enchilada plates, dessert- $39.  Not bad, but I subtracted a star for the $2 charge for chips and salsa.  The salsa was served in ketchup-sized ramekins, so it felt like a bit of a rip-off.  Yes, it's petty, but so is charging for what amounts to a bread basket."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Fancy Mexican food, there's no such thing in my mind.  $9 for a 12 ounce Margarita is absurd."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the spinach penne and turkey meatballs at Cilantro as well as the pizza.  They are excellent.  The food is great, simple but fresh ingredients and good presentation.  The interior of the restaurant is very comfortable and a diner can easily spend a few hours here.  The wine list is good."}
{"text":"I love Cilantro. I always come here for \"girls date night\" with my good friend Nats. We always get a bottle of wine and we always get a margarita flatbread. Always.  The flatbread here is very good. I actually think it's the only thing I've eaten on the menu besides the bocconcini salad. Calgary is currently going through a pizza affair, but Cilantro was perfecting classic flatbreads long before we all fell in love. Just eat it and you'll know what I mean.   This is a simple, straight-forward review because Cilantro is a simple and straight-forward restaurant. With an excellent menu, Cilantro has kept its little doors open as the market becomes more competitive in Calgary for locally-operated bistro-style places.   Exceptional flatbread, great atmosphere, an adorable patio, decent wine list and good service mean you'll go here, eat dinner, leave happy, and that's it.  T."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday around 5:30PM. Since it was a bit too early for the regular dining crowd, the restaurant was not busy.  We were seated promptly.   I presented our Groupon and the waiter told us about what was available for appetizers, but not dinner specials.  He indicated he had been working since 10AM and was a bit tired.  So, we listened in on another waitress at another table describing the specials in detail. We started with drinks, the Oso Cilantro and the Mango Cilantro Margarita. Both were very tasty. If it wouldn't have been included on the Groupon, we found them a bit expensive. My partner had the Carne Asada a la Tampiqueña (beef tenderloin) and I ordered the Game Hen en Escabeche.  Both entrees were good. I think the game hen was overpriced for the little hen, but it was very tasty, like it had been baked in a wood-fired oven. The skin was nice and crisp.  The accompanying sweet potato was good, not dry.  The Carne Asada tenderloin was done just right for my partner, although the waiter never asked how she wanted it done. Bottom line: We'd go back with another groupon, but probably not at current prices for what you get.  The waitstaff was attentive and the owner thanked us for coming on the way out.  Not sure if this would happen at really busy times."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of the Cilantro and Divino restaurants for many years and chose to celebrate my good friends birthday with a lunch at Cilantro earlier this week. First off, the service was great and I was very impressed with our waitress!  She was happy to give us a sample of different wines and was very helpful and knowledgable about the menu.  We both ordered the salad of the day which was listed as a grilled chicken breast with mixed greens, strawberries and almonds with a sour cherry vinaigrette.  What we got was ordinary at best.  The chicken was dry, the presentation was not up to par, with sliced strawberries arranged around the outside of the plate.  The mixed greens included chopped romaine and other small pieces of salad greens which were overdressed with what tasted like a balsamic dressing.  The slivered almonds were not toasted.  It is what I would have expected from a middle of the road chain restaurant and I was certainly surprised that this came from the kitchen at Cilantro!   I had talked up this place and was eager to introduce my friend to it.  I hope that we just caught it on an off day.  I will try it once more but I did notice that the place was not busy at all which is very different from past visits. I wonder why."}
{"text":"This place has the honor of being the possessor of the first wood fired oven in Calgary....  The atmosphere is very intimate and with candles lit, very romantic.  I hear there is a great patio, but it was a little too cold to check it out the night I went.  Just to let you know, everything is a la carte on the menu.  In addition to the variety of pizzas available, the wine selection is quite extensive and the waiter very well versed as to the pairings.  We decided to order several appetizers and have our meal \"tapas\" style and finishing off with the pizza.  When you want to try a little bit of everything and you're with a willing partner, this is the best way to go....in my opinion.    We started with the wild mushroom vegetable cream soup....rich, creamy, yummy.  Then we followed up with the fresh mussels in the black bean cream sauce....can I just say scrumptious?  Then our greens....young spinach greens, tarragon vinagrette, crispy pancetta, figs, toasted pecans and goat cheese - lemme say I could make my meal out of this refreshing salad....never had figs in a salad and it was just right with the tarragon vinagrette.  For pizza, we had the cappicola ham, tomatoes, roasted peppers, provolone cheese on a pesto crust....the crust could've been crispier, but it was still very good.  The only drawback was the amount of time it took to get our food and check...I guess it was really okay because we really wanted to take our time between the dishes and just enjoy each other's company....anyone else who may be starving may be quite annoyed...."}
{"text":"Great dining experience!  We love the CRMR group, but have yet to try Cilantro until last night.  We were immediately seated after arriving about 15 minutes early for our reservation.  We both ordered the ginger peach soda (really good!) and a bowl of the feature soup which was amazing.  We also both ordered a pasta dish and loved how the noodles are made in house.  I was so full that I had to take half my pasta home and I'm currently enjoying it for lunch while I type this out.    Our server was pleasant and always on cue.  The only downfall was that we were seated next to a table of about 14 people and it was quite loud, but no fault of the restaurant.    Would definitely recommend for a romantic dinner or even a nice dinner with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Late January, 2011  Saturday night  Months ago, first visit was typical for a new place with some service missteps, iffy drinks and basics not down pat. Second visit showed marked improvement on all counts. Recent lunch buffet was interesting with higher quality food than  I expect at an all-you-can-eat setup. Steam dishes were refilled with fresh food at a pretty good pace. Finally, dinner on Saturday night.  Very high quality ingredients, expertly prepared, attractively presented.  A little high on price given the relatively small portions but this ranked up there with the best Madison has to offer.  Definitely hitting their stride here at our own little Frontera outlet w/o the 3-hour wait!"}
{"text":"Huge wine list.  Intimate atmosphere. Delicious food.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass. It came with a cornmeal tamale. I was not a fan of tamales until that night. It was so fresh. Everything was topped with a tarty sweet sauce that reminded me of something my mom makes. It all made me very happy. My date had the lasagna. I took a bite and felt immediate regret! It was so good! So cheesy, so yummy. I wanted it all.   When I visit Calgary again, Cilantro will be on my list of restaurants to revisit."}
{"text":".Went to this place on a Friday night and they weren't open! Dont know how many stars to give...but I drove 20 min from the east side. They are doing groupons and are supposedly part of Badger Barter.  Hmmm I a confused. Yelp says \"closed\""}
{"text":"Does Madison deserve a restaurant the caliber of Cilantro? If so, why is this foray by Chicago-based Mexican-maven Rick Bayless in such a generic, nondescript part of the city? Given the ultra-fresh, predominantly vegetarian menu and its contemporary but not trendy vibe, surely this place belongs downtown off the square, not across from a high school in a mini strip mall.   Apart from the appetizer, we ordered nothing but specials, so I can't comment on the regular menu fare (though I was here once before and had the enchiladas with mole verde which were excellent). We started with the Seviche de Pescado, a cilantro-infused salsa with whitefish that was so fresh-tasting I was looking for the boat that caught the fish! I ordered the Cochinita special: pulled pork shoulder with pickled onions, black beans, and a lip-burning jabaneros sauce. It came with only two tortillas to build tacos with, which seemed insufficient given the amount of meat on the plate. Pork was a little dry, but very tender and perfectly seasoned. And having had \"true\" jabaneros in Mexico, I must say this was not your Midwestern, watered-down version of the fire sauce, it was the real thing (IOW, apply sparingly).  Kristine had Salmon En Mole, essentially the aforementioned enchiladas but made with baked salmon . . . very yummy.  The only thing keeping Cilantro from five stars was the level of service, primary from the kitchen.  They were clearly running behind, though the dining room didn't seem overly busy.  Appetizer and entrees all arrived a little later than we expected. And we got the wrong bill, though the waitress effectively corrected it while still accurately applying our Groupon. But it could have been worse . . . the two-top seated next to us had not yet received their entrees by the time we left, and they were seated first! Better luck next time (yes, there will be a next time) . . ."}
{"text":"A very good experience. Expensive but does not disappoint. Our party of 3 ordered the elk gnocchi (delish but a touch oversalted), the seafood pasta special with octopus (nice) and the hunan lamb rack (none of hunan's ginger-garlic-chili heat but yummy in a hoisin-ish way nonetheless). Had a nice glass of Italian red with the lamb. Generous portions. We were seated upstairs with ringside seats if you like a view of the woodfired oven. (we did). We reserved via Open Table. The meal worked out to $100 for the 3 of us, with one glass of wine."}
{"text":"After a long day of work, my colleagues and I decided to try something other than the usual, The Keg, in Calgary, and ventured over to Cilantro in search of something laid back and satisfying.  The menu at Cilantro is t what first comes to mind when you hear the name, I was thinking it might be Indian or Asian fusion. Alas, the menu features some Italian style items, as well as some local, or Canadian features.  We started with cocktails, and I had the Kentucky Caravan.  It was well crafted, featuring egg white and pear bitters.  It was different, but welcome!  Two of my fellow diners had the mushroom soup as their appetizers and raved about how good it was.  I had the focaccia with goat cheese, which came as a huge portion, enough for us all to share.  For the main course, I tried the Lemon Conchigliette, which was a pasta in a light lemony sauce, with some seared scallops, lobster, and some fresh peas.  It was again a generous portion, and very tasty and filling.  After appetizers and mains, none of us had room for dessert.  Next time I'm in Calgary, I will return!  I look forward to trying more of their unique menu items!"}
{"text":"I hate when a waiter destroys a nice evening out. Is it hard to say, \"Hi\" when you come up to the table, return to ask how to meal was, and promptly return once bringing the bill so we can actually pay and leave.  I won't let him ruin this place for me though! It was great food, good ambience. The clientele was a little, well.. they were calgary, and I know you know what I mean by that.  Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, this would be a great place to hang out with a couple of friends in the summer for good food and great conversation."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a very long time - with the Car2Go deal they had on with Mealshare we couldn't say no.  Decide that one of us would do the Mealshare menu and then we would add another main dish too the mix. That way we could try more things.  First off, thank you to a high end restaurant for doing something like Ride2Dine. With the discount we got with our Car2Go membership it made it easier to convince the Boy to give it a try. And what a great cause to support - love how Calgary restaurants have really gotten behind the concept.  Menu started with braised bison ravioli that came with bison consomme (poured out a tea pot), soft cured egg and little mushroom cube bits. So good! There were 5 pieces of ravioli which made it a good size. Bison was tasty. But honestly cant get over how tasty the consumme was - we tipped the bowl to scrap out every last drop.  Second off the menu was duck breast on bulgar risotto, currents, glazed carrots and cherry coke gastrique. What is gastrique you ask? Think caramelized sugar boiled down flavour saucy business. This one was a delightful just sweet enough match the the perfectly cooked duck breast. Loved the bulgar risotto - was my first time trying it.   We added the main of bison short rib on sweet potatoes hash and avocado salsa with fried egg on top. Elevated breakfast for dinner (no offense to the chef) and oh so good! Short ribs were fall apart soft and not overly seasoned or sauced so you could really taste the flavours from the meat which was a lovely change. Avocado salsa provided a fresh bit on top the the egg yolk almost being the sauce of the dish. My only question is why the sweet potatoes we so hard - not so hard they were inedible - just hard enough that they had to be bite through. The Boy says for texture difference and really liked it. I get it and appreciate it, just don't love it.   At this stage we were both pretty full and happy to share the dessert off the tasting menu. Dark chocolate and orange cake, with hazelnut chocolate mousse and white chocolate orange semifreddo. Decadent! Every component was a delight on there own and as a whole fantastic. It's not often I really love all things about a dessert but there was well crafted love put into this one. Excellent end to a lovely meal.   By the way the wine list is extensive but well Organised to help you out. We went with their 2 non alcoholic sodas and really enjoyed the flavour in both. Appreciate when restaurants make the syrups from scratch and really think through complimentary flavours. Enjoyed them so much that next time we go back the sodas will be the first thing ordered.   Waitress was lovely and helpful. Wasn't too attentive but there when we needed her. Gave us time to sit, chat and enjoy the food. Much appreciated.   Thanks for a great night out to the team at Cilantro."}
{"text":"Food is still unreal. Service is even better. Sit upstairs - it's warm and cozy - you feel more like you are in the mountains than down town. My only beef is they took the best caesar salad in the city off the menu. PLEASE BRING BACK THE CAESAR SALAD!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok to eat at.  I had Carne Asada and the sauce that came with it was just middle of the road.  The steak tasted great, was a bit under done (more rare than medium rare).  My husband had the Pork Tenderloin in a sweet sauce.  It was ok, but I expected a bigger hint of spice.  The homemade guacamole was great and so was the desserts.  The manager made up for some of our mishaps so I feel the service definitely tried to make up for any loss we had.  The pricing on the food was more than I expected but everything was fresh.  Fantastic server, fantastic management."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of the Rice Cafe that was here previously, I was excited. A friend's recommendation was on the mark.  I enjoyed the vegetarian special of the night. The service was nice. The food did take a bit of time but it was freshly prepared. The menu was filled with delicious sounding dishes and the traditional favorites: mojitos, enchiladas, chips, and salsa."}
{"text":"So cozy, so comfortable, so well taken care of and such tasty food. Brick oven baked pizzas made with amazingly fresh and tasty toppings and a wine list to die for. If you want incredibly delicious game meat, this is your place."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place but didn't.  The food was really pretty solid.  What blew the evening were the poor, sad, $12 \"top shelf\" margaritas.  There was no selection of recommended margaritas.  Instead, we were asked, on the spot, to choose which tequila we wanted for our drink.  We chose and lost.  They put the lovely Don Julio tequila in w/ triple sec and whatever other over-sweet mix thing they had going on, and charged $12 for a cocktail that obscured all of the fresh elements that you look for in an ambitious margarita.  I would have preferred a lesser tequila mixed with a better orange liqueur, and great fresh citrus.  The seviche was pretty darned good.  Same for the queso fundido.  We shared the pesca Veracruzana.  The fish was freshly crisp and the sauce, a nice compliment, offered a balance with acid, brine and savory warmth.  The service was on the level of Olive Garden.  Whatevah.  I can abide mediocre service if the cuisine is worth it.    Given the insulting drinks, the Starbucks-esque ambiance, yet better-than-decent food, we still won't be back."}
{"text":"Really, really good! It had been on our to-do list re restaurants in Calgary to hit and I am so glad for whatever reason that we decided to grab a couple of friends on a Sat night and go for a 730 reso.  The eatery is not that big so resos are recommended (we used Open Table, so easy). Our table was ready for us when we got there and the staff were nice enough to take our jackets from us. Not a large place but super cute, cozy and dim. Great for large groups (it was quite loud in the beginning but not uncomfortably so) good for girl's night out, a group of 4 like us, or for 2 on a romantic date.  This place delivers wonderful ambiance and I almost felt like I was in a clean, sophisticated yet comfortable cottage. Now, the service and the food - you will wait for. The drinks took a long time to get.  We were in and out in 4 hours and as lovely a time as I had, I was getting antsy and was feeling by hour 3 that I really needed to stretch my legs and walk off some of the food I had eaten! This entailed us having appies, drinks, mains and a bday brownie dessert (thanks Cilantro!) and coffee. THE FOOD! Someone leading this kitchen brigade knows what they are doing. Love the Italian inspired menu, lots of choices.  FRESH! Gluten-free people, we learned that this is not a place for you after we learned about the house made pasta. TO DIE FOR DELICIOUS! Thankfully, we did not have dietary restrictions and could order whatever we wanted. We ordered the creamy potato soup $9 and the spinach salad with bacon wrapped shrimp.Oh, so good! Our friends had the smoked salmon appy and they loved it! I had the shell pasta main with seafood and chorizo. I was afraid that it would be overcooked as I like my pasta al dente. I had nothing to fear, the dish was perfect, great portion size too. Everyone else had different flatbread pizzas which we had read were excellent. Very thin, wood oven pizza crust, fresh toppings and they were some of the best I feel Calgary has to offer in terms of Za of this style. I had a couple of the signature drinks. The pear one was good, I would not get the apple one again. They are $12 which will run you double as it is only $6.25 to get a normal cocktail, say a Vodka/tonic. Will return in a heartbeat for the food and beautiful space. We just know to come when not in any kind of rush. The food was  thankfully worth the wait but for our service in particular, 4 stars.  Not the priciest place in town, nor the cheapest."}
{"text":"loved this place. had great character and good food. Would definately come again if I were in Calgary."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago we came here blind, chosen randomly from Open Table.  The staff were friendly and professional, the decor is simple but elegant. I had the rotini, and my wife had the linguini, and I had  one of the Dieu Du Ciel beers, Grande Noriceur, which was served in a smallish glass.  My rotini was nicely done, with a good blend of flavours in the sauce and a nice contrast of textures.  The linguini was quite nice, too.  Overall impression was \"pretty good\"... Until we ordered dessert!  We got the Peanut Butter Pie and the Pineapple Walnut Carrot Cake, and it was like discovering buried treasure!  Both of them were beautifully plated, and very good! SO good that I just drove downtown from the NE to get them again as a takeout order!"}
{"text":"Really really good. They take great pride in their food. Wood Burning oven, seriously high quality food- like really!! Everyone was so nice, this is probably the first time in a long time that the service was absolutely, totally  exceptional, I could say one bad thing. Salad was great! The pizza- the cheese was def not store bought mozzarella, no way also home made, had to be.  The sauce...was so delicate- not a sauce that is tart like the chain pizza places. Amazing!!!  4 stars only because my husband told me I can't keep giving 5 stars to most places,  as I will loose credibility. So, four stars it is.  :-)"}
{"text":"as a food-ie, i've eaten at literally thousands of places in over 20 countries, and Cilantro in Madison is the first place I would describe as \"gourmet Mexican\"...sounds good, but the food is anything but gourmet.  upon arriving at the restaurant, we are greeted in a small space, occupied by a nicely stocked bar giving it a cozy ambiance,  we were then escorted to the main dining room, which is spacious and decorated with interesting pieces of art.  the rest of the decorations were tacky at best, and I found myself trying to not looking at the multicolored window drapes.  We did not order any appetizers and went straight to the entrees.  My date had the vegetarian fajitas and I had the \"jumbo shrimp and rice.\"  Well, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, about 15-20 minutes.    I was immediately disappointed by my entree; the jumbo shrimp were not \"jumbo\"...just regular size.  The rice came in a nice pyramid and was cooked with cilantro.  I tried the rice first and found that it was not cooked correctly.  it was damp and completely without taste, even with the cilantro.  I then tried the shrimp and it tasted like all the other shrimp i've had at any Mexican restaurant for less than half the price.    My date said she thought her meal was \"ok\" which is never good.    Our waitress was pesky and had poor timing.  I paid about $50( including tip) for 2 entrees.  The food is terrible and even at half the price, I would not eat here again or recommend it.    Once again, Madison has been lacking a good Mexican restaurant and Cilantro only makes things worse."}
{"text":"I had wanted to go to this restaurant for a long time and finally had the opportunity on a beautiful sunny day so I decided to sit on the patio. Unfortunately, I was still able to feel the warmth of the air, however the sun was unable to hit me as a result of all the trees surrounding the patio. For some this may be fine but not for me as I am a sun goddess. However, it was a beautiful patio.  It was also a nice amenity that Cilantro has two unique buildings- one for restaurant and one for a bar (one where the atmosphere is quiet and the other where it is appropriate to be more loud) separated by the patio.  I didn't feel like anything with alcohol to drink as there were no special cocktails. What was special was the homemade side! It was delicious they have two different kinds: strawberry-rhubarb and cherry vanilla. I tried them both. Cherry Vanilla is nothing special as it has already been done by Coca-Cola and Strawberry Rhubarb is also becoming popular as Anejo has it as a type of margarita.  I loved the appetizers that I had there 1). Prawns (caramel ginger child sauce) and 2). Baked Ricotta (fig and lemon granola, mustard melon, focaccia toast, red wine gastrique).  For a main meal I had the B.L.T. Sandwich (smoked gouda, basil pesto, dijon) and I added chicken. I wanted to get it given the smoked gouda on it I thought would be delicious and give it lots of flavour especially mixed with dijon, however, the sandwich was very bland and had hardly any flavour. The sandwich although it seemed special- was nothing special. I also had the fire roasted tomato pizza which again was nothing special..  For dessert I enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding (butterscotch bourbon ice-cream, homemade caramel). I expected an actual homemade caramel to be on, however, there was not so I was a little disappointed as it is a typical dessert I was expecting the caramel to make it unique.  I also tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie (graham cracker crust, grand marine whip cream) as it is a unique dessert that is quickly becoming more popular and it was also no different form any other. I do think they ned to improve their description on the menu though as the things they highlight for the pie on the menu was not the highlight of what I wanted to know for the dessert such as: is it chunk or smooth peanut butter? What jam is also on it?  When I go back (and I say when because I will be going back) I will only be going back for the appetizers and the homemade drinks."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Pizza is to die for. Ambiance is great and good for a romantic dinner away from the kids. :)"}
{"text":"I just went to Cilantro for the first time.  It is in a strip mall, so it is easy to miss if you're not looking for it, but it is definitely worth looking for.  This is a more upscale restaurant, not a burritos and nachos kind of place.  I had the Carnitas and they were wonderful.  I grew up in Oaxaca, Mexico and I can honestly say that it has been YEARS since I tasted a really good corn tortilla.  I think I had forgotten what a really good tortilla tasted like.  But the tortillas at Cilantro brought it all back to me and made me homesick for Mexico (in a happy way).  The servers and management and busboys were all very good, very pleasant, and not at all overbeearing.  I had to restrain myself from running into the kitchen to kiss whoever made those tortillas.  I loved this place.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Let's start at the top. The service was slow and the waitress could barely pronounce the name of the specials.  I know that not everyone needs to know Spanish to work at a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but if you can not pronounce the specials, please search for another place to work.    The food was average maybe even below average, but I am too nice to say it.  I had the 5 plate bocadillo and the veggie enchiladas.  The 5 plate, was small, completely bland and unappetizing.  As for the veggie enchiladas, bland.  They are small portions and plain white rice.  It says that it was cilantro-lime rice, but honestly it was so bland. I left still hungry wondering what I just spent my money on.   They are trying too hard to be an upscale restaurant. It took them an hour to serve my room temperature meal.  Do not go there. It is awful. I love food and I love Mexican food, but this place is a place I would never recommend.  Oh and those photos? Not helpful at all.  Sometimes I wish there was a no-star option."}
{"text":"A-List. Great Ambiance. Good Food. Excellent Wine. Friendly Service. Expen$$$ive."}
{"text":"Cilantro is much nicer than it seems.  I saw that there were sandwiches on the menu, so I assumed it would be fairly casual - wrong assumption.  As soon as we walked in (wearing jeans), the waitress told the hostess that she could seat us in the back.  Clearly we were not dressed to impress the waitress; however, we were seated in the front and received exceptional service from a waiter that was not disillusioned by our attire.  The food was good, but I will not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Cilantro is the newest Mexican restaurant on Madison's west side.  It attempts to define a different experience than most Mexican restaurants in town, elevating Mexican cuisine to a fine-dining standard.  Nothing is slathered in cheese here, and each entree is unique.  If you're used to standard traditional Mexican, such as what's available at Pedro's or Laredo's, you'll be in for an entirely new experience here.  However, as with all new restaurants, there were several problems with the food, the decor, and the service.    When we arrived, the place was packed and we were among several groups who arrived at the same time.  Before dinner, we had what is apparently the 'signature' margarita - a mixture of cilantro leaves and mango nectar with tequila, served in a small rocks glass with cubed ice.  For $7, the drink was disappointingly small, and one of my companions noted a textural issue.  The mango juice was really thick and made the cocktail one step below a smoothie.  Also, the mango flavor overpowered the cilantro because the bartender didn't muddle the cilantro, and this was also disappointing because I was excited at the prospect of the flavor combination.  We tried two appetizers before dinner.  The first, a trio of empanadas, had perfectly braised pork in a crispy, flaky empanada shell with two complementary sauces - a Sinaloan red chile sauce and an avocado mayo.  The second was a trio of chalupas, which consisted of three open-faced corn masa ovals topped with either chorizo and potatoes, mole with chicken, and mushrooms in a guajillo sauce.  All were excellent.    For dinner, A companion's chicken mole entree was outstanding, with hints of chocolate and cinnamon in the lightly sweet-yet-savory sauce.  Another companion's duck breast had an excellent tamarind sauce, which was also sweet and savory, but his duck was poorly trimmed and contained more fat than he expected - even from duck.  My fish enchiladas were decent, but one of the trio of enchiladas contained bits of fish that were overcooked.  The sauce, a green tomatillo mole, was very spicy and advertised pumpkin seeds on top.  I only counted a few, and they did little to enhance the flavor of the dish.  Also, I only received one of the two accompaniments to my entree, cilantro rice, because the beans that were advertised to come with it never showed up.  It ended up being a godsend, though, because when I tried a companion's beans they had an overwhelming liquid smoke flavor that I found disgusting.    Throughout our experience, we received incredibly poor service.  It took 40 minutes between the time we were seated and the time our appetizers arrived, during which we were served chips and salsa, but no plates, silverware or napkins.  Also, I was already finished with my entree when the waitress came back to ask how everything was, and I had no water for most of my meal, having never recieved a refill after the first pour.  It didn't look like there were any bussers, so the waitstaff was overextended doing expediting, waiting, and all bussing.  Also, when I pointed out I never received the side of beans that was supposed to come with my meal, the waitress argued with me and said that they don't come with what I ordered.  When she brought out the menu, she discovered she was wrong.  Finally, when we received our bill, we noticed a comp charge for all the mistakes, which was nice, but were also slapped in the face when we discovered an additional charge for a margarita we didn't order.    The decor at Cilantro is schizophrenic, with at least three different types of chairs, and a random laptop computer sitting out by the entrance foyer.  The tables have white tablecloths, and there is a lot of Mexican art on the walls.  The floor is a blond hardwood, the ceiling is exposed to the rafters, and there are floor-to-ceiling windows, making the small space look more like a yoga studio than an upscale Mexican restaurant.    I hope that Cilantro works out its kinks with staffing and service, so the focus - the food - can shine through."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times left wishing I could like it more...  The first time was for lunch, and I tried the buffet, thinking that this would be a good way to try several dishes and know what to order off the menu next time. I was REALLY disappointed in the selection. There were rice and beans, chilaquiles(which are corn tortillas in a tomatillo sauce), two quesadillas, maybe one more item(which was obviously forgettable) and basic salad and fruit. Meh...Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out. I thought that this was just the curse of the buffet, and decided to go again for brunch.  First of all, 11 seems a bit late to start a brunch...but whatever. We ordered Cafe de Olla to drink, but were bummed when our server said that they were having issues and would only have regular coffee. I ordered the Huevos Divorciados that I had seen in an article. The tomatillo sauce was tangy and nice, but the \"roasted tomato\" sauce just reminded me of tomato soup. One of my eggs was yolky, but one was hard. Not something I'd order again. The boyfriend had Huevos con Chorizo which was basic. The eggs were overcooked, and we've gotten more chorizo-y flavor out of the dish at El Dorado.   All in all, I don't think I'd go out of my way to stop here again. I miss Rice Cafe..."}
{"text":"So we decided to Cilantro a try. Apps and drinks were fine. My dinner and my wife's dinner were luke warm. At least our two other friends had hot food served to them. Took ten minutes to get our meals back. The owner came over to apologize but the waiter never did. When we got our bill which was good bill for 4, $130 I expected to see something knocked off the bill due to having to send the food back. Last time I eat there and besides this review I will let others to go to our favorite Mexican place La Mestiza or Casa Del Sol instead. Hasta la vista Cilantro."}
{"text":"really decent lunch.  i had the slow-cooked pork soft tacos with pineapple and black beans and it was fab.  the guac was fresh and the pineapple was not canned.  the pork had a really nice adobo-smokiness to it and was very tender.  everything on the plate tasted delicious.  i would bet there was lard in the black beans because they were just that good.  nice seasoning, not too overwhelming or spicy.  the waitress was a little weird, like she had a hard time making her mouth form a smile, but she was effective and timely so that is probably more important.  she did offer me additional tortillas at no cost (lunch came with three) but i opted to just take home my remaining tortillas and fillings without the tortilla refill.    so, minus one star since the chips and salsa were nothing you'd want to take home in a doggy bag and i wasn't blown away by the flavors in the green or red salsa; both seemed a little on the bland side and overly pureed.  i like salsa with a little texture and chips that aren't swimming in salt.  have to say, i was nervous when it came out because normally you can tell if a restaurant is hit or miss based on the first appetizer.  however, overall, really good lunch, nice price, fresh food - i'd go back.  i just wouldn't ask for the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to go here because we loved the previous mexican restaurant.  It was good, not fantastic that I am rushing back,but good.  The decor is a bid weird and not what I expected.  The service was very prompt.  We tried the Mango Cilantro Margarita, my sister loved it but I thought it was ok.  We ordered chips and salsa, they brought 2 types of salsa, I was in love with the green and my sister was in love with the red!!!  The scallops were AMAZING!!!  There was some heavenly green sauce they were in that made me want to lick my plate, definitely recommend these!  We also had the pork w/ pumpkin and some red sauce, it was ok."}
{"text":"Great night out here, everytime. Some tips:  1) Eat upstairs - or on their patio in the summer. Much cooler, less formal atmosphere.  2) Chicken and Panceta pizza - DO IT! Unreal.  3) They have some sort of hot-chocolate cakey dessert that was mind blowing."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it's been great both times. The mole was off-the-chart. Given the hit or miss reviews here, i wonder if they have a consistency problem or if there just isn't much appreciation for upscale mexicana? Anyway, i'll be back and i hope they keep bringing me 5star meals..."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved Cilantro. The food is all prepared fresh using local/organic ingredients where possible and is beautifully presented.  They had some very interesting cocktails, a great wine list and really yummy salads; the nicoise salad was absolutely fabulous.  This restaurant has a wonderful patio and very welcoming and superbly attentive staff - our server had a great sense of humor too, which we really made the evening...  Did we mention desserts? ;-)   All home made and absolutely splendid... best chocolate/peanut butter tart and best strawberry ice cream we've ever had anywhere...  the pastry chef should be given a michelin star - just superb.... :-)  If you hadn't guessed, we would HIGHLY recommend you visit Cilantro! ;-)"}
{"text":"The name Cilantro might throw you for a loop if you've never heard of them before. I'm sure most people would guess Vietnamese or something Asian right? WRONG. Not even close! Cilantro is higher end restaurant that fall under something like contemporary, modern fusion food. Located on trendy 17th Ave, you can't miss it as it's near Anju and right next door to one of it's sister restaurant's, Bar C. It actually makes sense to me now why you can see into Bar C's patio from one of Cilantro's kitchen windows. The CRMR group owns them along with Divino Wine & Cheese Bistro and the Lake House.  We reserved a table online last minute (literally 30 minutes beforehand just in case) but it wasn't even necessary. Everyone was sitting out on the patio. The rest of the restaurant inside was empty save for a table or two. It worked in our favour as my sister wanted to stay inside. FYI, they do have blankets for people that get cold easily (genius!). Our waitress for the evening was great, very knowledgeable and entertaining. Lots of witty banter.  The menu is small and made up mostly of pizza, pasta, panini's and meat entrees. They have a separate menu that had quite a few daily specials to choose from but we stuck to the main one.  - Apple cider brut tender ($35.00) - made from 20 types of different apples. The description is hilarious. \"You like apples, drink this.\" Straight to the point. It would have been nice to know which apples were used. The cider was tasty, it tasted exactly like apples.  - Cheese plater ($12.00) - you have the option of choosing from 5 different types of cheese. We went with three (skipped out on the other two which were blue cheeses) but it's nice they give you the option of loading up on more of a certain type. Mahón, chèvre and triple cream brie. My favourite was the brie - smooth, creamy richness, it disappeared in the blink of an eye. The fig jam was also delicious. Not too sweet. It went well with a couple pieces of soft brown bread. - Smoked salmon ($15.00) - vanilla-citrus cream, pickled onions and pumpernickel crostini's. The smoked salmon was also quite good. The vanilla-citrus cream was refreshingly light (someone thought they detected hints of dill) while the smoked salmon contrasted nicely with a slightly salty finish to it. The crostini's were really crunchy, I would have preferred them to be less so.  - Lemon conchigliette ($24.00) - chorizo, scallops, lobster, snap peas, poblano in a basil-chevre parmesan cream sauce. This was my entrée for the night. The conchigliette, shaped like tiny conch shells, were cooked al dente and had a good variety of seafood to it. I definitely got bites of chorizo and scallops but I don't recall eating any lobster. The sauce was rich and creamy without having that heaviness to it. - Chilean sea bass ($40.00) - cornmeal tamale, grilled peppers and a citrus ancho chili sauce. My sis ordered the sea bass and loved it. I had a bite and the fish was super tender and bursting with flavour. The accompanying beans were perfectly cooked. - Lasagna ($23.00) - chicken pepper sausage, smoked gouda, poblano peppers, feta, spinach in a smokey tomato sauce. This lasagna is a little different than the norm. Much more tomato sauce based over being stuffed with a ton of meat. Not that that's a bad thing. The flavours were nicely balanced and our friend thought it was really delicious.  - Chocolate peanut butter pie ($9.00) - the chocolate peanut butter pie was heavenly. With a graham cracker crust and Grand Marnier whipped cream, we gobbled this up. It tasted a bit like a fancy reese's piece. Definitely leave room for dessert! - Flourless chocolate quinoa cake ($9.00) - our second dessert was a bust. Flourless chocolate quinoa cake, coconut jelly and dulce de leche. I tasted a bite - the texture of the coconut jelly was unpleasant. Just not good at all. The flourless chocolate cake was a little better but pretty dry and tasteless. Even our waitress agreed it shouldn't be on the menu...  With so many options to choose from on 17th Ave, Cilantro was a pleasant find. There's a reason why they've been open for over 20 years. Food prepared with care, excellent service and a relaxing vibe, just don't be in a rush and you'll enjoy yourself. We were there for over two hours and weren't hurried out even though we were the last table there. The meat entrees are expensive but you can stick to the pizza/pastas which are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I want to say I love this place, but the food was not amazing so I've gotta give it only 3 stars. Their patio is fantastic - private, twinkle lights, off the street, enclosed, just awesome. Their wine list is impressive. Their wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. But my meal was not fab, I'm afraid. Maybe we chose poorly. For an appetizer we ordered the chili shrimp, which had 6 shrimp with an Asian ginger based sweet heat sauce, and the shrimp were really good. But for $14 that's more than $2/shrimp and they were not very big shrimp. Also, why the Mexican blue corn tortilla chips as the accompaniment? That was an odd pairing (but I know it's just cuz it made the plate look bigger and more stylized. Still, the Food Network has taught me that everything on the plate is meant to be eaten, and together, so I think they could've gone with a different edible decoration). For entrees we ordered two of the flatbread pizzas, and both we disappointing. The flavour profiles were a bit strange, the chicken was dry, the \"spicy\" was non-existent, etc.  But still, we had a great time, and did I mention I love this patio? So give it a try, just maybe order a pasta or something. Oh, and totally check out my pic of the wine descriptions- every one of them is hilarious!"}
{"text":"We had the chips and salsa to start, but since they make their chips, I like when places serve them warm. It came with two salsas, which were good.  I got the chicken enchiladas.They were warm in the middle but the sauce was cold. The sauce was good but the enchiladas themselves were tasteless and the chicken was dry. I found two bones in my first enchilada (of three). Couldn't eat anymore after that. It was ok, but for $18 I expected MUCH more.  Also, it was ridiculously bright in the place- they have several kinds of lights and they were all on. It's nicely decorated, but being there after 7 when it was brighter than a sunny day inside was a little awkward."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and every single time it's been wonderful.  The dishes I've had include 2/3 of the menu.  The service has been great (with one afternoon exception, where I had no refill during the entire meal), and the owner is always there.  He makes the rounds at the tables asking if there are any questions and imparting little stories and bits of info about the dishes.  I have been blown away by a few of the entrees, and loved all the apps.  Wish I could pick a favorite, but so far, they've all been really tasty, good portions and overall very well done.  Also, it's the only place I've found since moving here from the southwest that has a really good hibiscus tea.  The server I had the first time brought out a couple of the blossoms from the kitchen that they use to make the tea.  It was the highest quality blossom I've seen outside of Mexico.  She informed our table that the owner orders most of his ingredients from Mexico, since he knows the quality well.  It shows."}
{"text":"Cilantro was recommended to us by a friend in Calgary.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for good food in a great location.  The service and outdoor seating were fantastic.  The food was very good, but not as great as others have written here.  It was during the Stampede, so perhaps they were busier than normal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the shrimp and the ribs. Amazing quality and a reasonable wine listvasceell.. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Imagine having dinner in the coziest room of your house being served fresh home cooked meals and sipping on heavenly glasses of wine. That's what keeps me coming back to Cilantro over and over again. I highly recommend the mushroom soup which is hearty and delicious. The rack of lamb is the absolute best in the city with a hoisin glaze rather then the traditional dijon mustard found all over the city. Ask to be served by Reuben, Mackie or Lindsay- All experts at what they do"}
{"text":"Started with a $10 margarita with little to no tequila in it. My husband, son and I ordered three different dishes, only to be told they were out of all three!  We re-ordered. My husband had the beef, I had the pork and both of us thought they were overpriced and flavorless.  I couldn't find my \"grilled  vegetables\" as the portion was hidden under the meat and teeny.  It consisted of one small slice (1 inch diameter) of yellow squash, 1 smaller slice of onion and two tinier slices of something else I couldn't identify. 1/8 c.., max. The meat was tough--needed to have been marinated or at least cooked in the sauce in order to pick up the flavor. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to Cilantro for the first time with a buddy, and we wanted to try something different and new. Decided to put in a same day reservation for noon and Cilantro had openings.  The decor is pretty nice, with both an up and downstairs seating area. They also have patio seating, which we didn't use due to the rain. The main floor is brighter with more natural lighting. The upstairs is dimmer, but has a cool view of the wood fired oven.  Started off with the Wild Mushroom Soup (very flavourful with just the right amount of tenderness to the veggies) and Beef Tenderloin Slices (nice pink inside with cherry chutney). As for the mains I had the Chicken and Pancetta Flatbread Pizza (nice flavours, slightly thicker dough), and my buddy had the Lemon Pasta. For dessert, I had the Upsidedown Cheesecake  (neat looking, almost too many chocolate chips, but quite sweet)  and the Pineapple Sorbet (more like crushed Pineapple with some sugar).   Overall, I would go back to try out other dishes, since I love the taste of Cilantro itself.  A little pricey,  but you do go away full."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night with my fiancé and was seated at a cute little table for two at the window. The restaurant is definitely cozy as many reviews have stated. My fiancé started with the mussels - black bean cream sauce $16 (our server said these were the more popular ones vs. the chorizo clam broth. He said they were delicious. I started with the burrata $15, I have had better but the dish was still good.  For our mains my fiance had the New Zealand Rack of Lamb $44 (hunan . shallot mashed) which he really enjoyed. I had the salad that was listed on the daily specials list, I can't remember what was in it exactly, but it was a good portion and yummy. We asked for a side order of sautéed mushrooms as well. Everything was really tasty. It is a very romantic and cute restaurant, definitely something suitable for a nice date night.  We ordered about 5-6 as well, so our bill was quite high, so bring the credit card :P"}
{"text":"Very nice place!!.. All appetizers  were very good.. And the wine too.. Also the service was great.. The beef tenderloin was delicious and the prawns too. The cheese was great too.. I would definitely go back there.."}
{"text":"I went to Cilantro for the first time last week.  I was so glad I finally checked this restaurant out - I had a delicious meal!  We sat in the upper level and found the place so cozy.  I love that I can watch the chefs prepare my food from scratch;  I was observing all the fresh ingredients that were putting in my meal.  The pizza oven is adorable too! For my appetizer I had the goat cheese.  It came with Crostini, arugula, sliced pickled onions and a delicious spiced pistachio sauce.  It was delicious, best comfort food ever. For my main I had the seafood pasta (cannot remember what it was called though) - with prawn, lobster, giant scallops and a lemon sauce.  Soooo good.  I couldn't finish it all, as it's rich, so I took some home and ate it later that night. The meal was very filling and prepared well.  My friend had a BLT on pesto flatbread with arugula and really enjoyed it as well.  Meal with a glass of wine came to about $75.  A bit on the pricier side, but for the fresh ingredients, the preparation and the ambiance - it's about on par with any other similar restaurant in the downtown/beltline.  Our server was attentive and gave me the recommendation for the lobster pasta, which I was definitely glad I picked.  I'll definitely come back - if even for the goat cheese!  I'm drooling thinking about it right now!"}

{"text":"Overall, you need to give it a try.  Our first attempt was not Frontera Grill, but I saw small sparkles of it shining through some small mistakes.    So far, ok.  My hubby and I tried Ciliantro for lunch this past weekend.  We tried the queso fundido, tacos with steak, and the guacamole.  I was expecting beautiful gelatinous goo covered in churizo, but unfortunately it felt like melted mozzerella with greasy meat on top.  The steak was good, but the chile marinade was bland . . . a heavy pan and high heat could have created a stellar crust to allow the meat to shine.  It came with the guacamole and a beautiful roasted tomato salsa.  The guacamole was fresh, creamy and chunky.  I would have preferred a bit of spice, but overall lovely.  The fresh corn tortillas and corn chips were made fresh.  Grainy and perfectly seasoned; they redeemed the meal.  Service was slightly confusing . . . not sure who our service was, one of three who served us, but overall good and pleasant.  We plan of giving Cilantro another try, probably for dinner.  I think they have many emerging qualities that were untapped during our visit.  I especially want to try the cilantro mango margarita and possible the lamb for dinner.   The chips and"}
{"text":"The service was spectacular! My server Dustin was super friendly and knowledgeable.The patio was nice and cozy! My gamemeat loaf (elk +bison) was fantastic! Loved the nice crispness to the focaccia flatbread and the meat was nice and moist with only a hint of gaminess. Only thing I didn't particularly enjoy about my meal was the pickled veggies on the side. But it's only a side, so meh. In my humble opinion, the food and service is well worth the 15-20 minutes walk from the city centre."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place was getting such bad reviews.  My group and I liked it a lot.  The guacamole and salsas were awesome.  They also had a mole verde that was fantastic.  The carnitas were delicious.  Nice chunks of roasted pork and you dunk them in the mole verde and eat with a tortilla.  Yum.  We shared the tres leches cake and that was solid as well.  Modestly sweet with a nice mango sauce on the side.  The sangria and the flan were the only things I didn't like.  The flan was too \"earthy\".  Sangria tasted a little on the sour side.  The wait staff was great too.  I don't know if the decor was that weird.  The location in a strip mall off Gammon is the only weird thing about it"}
{"text":"Living close to 17th avenue is going to drive me broke or fat, because now I have another very good restaurant within blocks.  To our benefit it was not very crowded this last Saturday night, made the somewhat small restaurant feel bigger and we were helped out by a very attentive waitress.  Drinks, food, ambiance all followed suit for an all in all positive experience.  In a karmic win, the best dish of the night was the lamb shank barbacoa, excellent compilation and presentation, and the taste was incredible - set up with meat on the bone, rice, small tortillas, and a side of sauce for your to construct your own tacos.  The compounding awesomeness here is that when ordering Cilantro will match with a meal donation - so you get to feel good twice.  Braised bison had some unique flavoring, odd pairing with grits but somehow worked because I cleaned my plate."}
{"text":"Food ok, but not for the price, dinner for two with 2 watery sangrias was $60! Service was incredibly slow, although it was busy for a Tuesday nite. The staff were running around, didn't look like they knew what they were doing. They should have this figured out by now."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not memorable. At least not yet. Atmosphere was seriously lacking, service was prompt--too prompt--and not genuine in the way she talked.  Food was good! Mango cilantro margherita was unique and tasty. Guacamole was exactly how I would have expected it to be. My mother kept raving about the chips, though I didn't think they were anything special. The Hucheco from the appetizer menu was REALLY good, the vegetarian enchiladas were just ok. The dessert menu sounded great, didn't try anything.  I would definitely give this place another shot in a few months. But if you're looking for a place that has authentic Mexican food nailed (as well as service and atmosphere, meaning not fancy but real), go to La Mestiza."}
