They had a potato based clam chowder, it's interesting, but personally I prefer the cream based chowder."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for a quick fish sandwich if you are on college. It's definitely good and worth checking out but I wasn't seriously impressed in any particular way. I think it might have a bit too high of a rating but nonetheless not bad."}
{"text":"The fish store, known for its fresh griddled fish sandwiches was on my list of places to try. After reading so many reviews and nothing but high praise for this place my expectations were sky high. 

Did it deliver? It was good. It wasn't mind blowing but it was a good sandwich. 

I ordered the halibut sandwich with a salad, halibut was dressed with lettuce tomato and some seasoning.  Halibut was cooked perfectly, fish was delicate and seasoned well, my only nitpick would be that it needed some sort of a cream sauce. It tasted like it had a balsamic vinegrette drizzled onto the fish, and it soaked onto the foccaccia bun. Overall I was pleased, from what I remember I almost paid 20 dollars for a drink sandwich and salad so it was rather pricy. It's a very small place with a few tables outside so your best option might be take out."}
{"text":"5 stars for the price, selection of seafood, and freshness.
My favourite place in the cheap eats division, and a few other divisions as well."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for some time. Finally got out on a friday afternoon for an early dinner. 

The store itself was small and quaint, with seating for up to 4 people. The fresh fish was laid out for you to choice from. 
We had an arctic char salad and grouper sandwich ($9.75 each). 
The dish presentation was nice quite. The salad had the usual suspects, along with grilled asparagus and nice balasmic dressing.

Overall, the meal was fresh and well-cooked. Definitely would come back to try another sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish sandwiches. Small family run business.

Women that works there is always very pleasant.

They need to have pickerel more often! I usually stick with the fish special as they are all good.

Great clam chowder also.

Simple, fresh, tasty good. 4 stars."}
{"text":"You can't help but like this place.  It is about the size of my closet, yet somehow they have managed to squeeze a restaurant in there.  Let's make it clear though--it is the smallest restaurant that I have ever set foot in.  There two tiny round tables with four chairs.  And the next person that comes in to order?  You have to squeeeeze in.  It is that small.

The restaurant is very colourful.  Baby blue is the themed colour here and it is cheerful and fun.  They have some fish jokes on the wall that you can read while you wait for your sandwich, like... Q: Why is it so easy to weigh fish?   A: Because they have their own scales.   Cheezy, but you get the idea =)

They have on display a selection of fish on ice.  From what I can remember, I saw salmon, tilapia, cod, haddock and a few others... I went with the grouper.  It goes on a griddle, with lots of their dry house seasoning on it, and comes out chopped and golden brown.  It is then stuff into a portuguese bun, with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and some mayo.  

Mmmmm delicious.  I would for sure go back.  I think it was around $8 for the sandwich.  Probably not the best bang for the buck, but then again, you are getting high quality fish that is well prepared and not some greasy burger.  The owners, while limited in English, were very friendly and helpful.  I think they a family, and it is nice to see a tiny family run business do well in midst of all the other restaurants."}
{"text":"I spent an entire summer living around the corner from this place and never ate in there once. People would tell me to check it out but I would say, \"Yeah, I don't really like fish that much.\"

Then I ate it. 

I am an idiot for not going sooner. 

I had a shrimp sandwich and added a side of avocado. The sandwich was absolutely amazing! The bread was soft and gooey. The shrimp was grilled and seasoned beautifully and the toppings and sauce gave the sandwich a delicious flavour. It was one of the best sandwiches I have had in the city. 

I've also had the scallop sandwich and it was good but not as good as the shrimp in my books. I will go back and try more types of fish. 

Grab it to go along with a lemonade and have yourself a quiet picnic in the park. It's a perfect afternoon."}
{"text":"Despite having read some reviews, the size of this place (or lack thereof) took me by surprise. There's only one two-person table inside but there are four tables and a few bar stools out in the open. I'm sure it's nice in pleasant weather.
The sandwich was made fresh, and it had more of a kick than most fish (tacos, sandwiches, burritos) I've had. The fish sandwich is served in a small sub roll with a generous serving of fish on a  bed of lettuce, tomatoes and onions and a hint of cilantro. The table had the standard salt/pepper shaker with a small bottle of Tabasco but none of these were necessary.
Fish Sandwich/Burrito/Salad prices vary from $6.50 for the daily special fish to $10 for the sea bass (see photo). The Fish Burger is $4 but (obviously) doesn't have as much protein as the sandwich.
All in all, color me unimpressed; not disappointed, nor unwilling to ever go again."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I lived down the street from the Fish Store for 8 years and due to my general lack of desire to eat fish, didn't start eating there until my last 3 years... and that was a huge mistake. 

I luckily still work down the street and go to the Fish Store at minimum once a week for lunch. Everyone on here seems to love the sandwich or the burrito, but I assure you the fish meal is the greatest thing of all time. 

The perfectly cooked fish over perfectly cooked brown rice, topped with the amazing sesame fish sauce and a bit of hot sauce is the greatest thing ever. Add to that a slew of different fresh veggies (currently cucumber, broccoli, asparagus, tomato, {avocado +$1.50}  and olives) and you've got a fish meal that can't be found anywhere else. 

For take out, call ahead and by the time you arrive, if it isn't ready, they'll push your order to the front (because they appreciate the call ahead order). Also, don't forget to ask what the special is, because if you aren't that picky on your type of fish, then it'll save you a few bucks. In the summer there is space to eat outside, but otherwise it's really tight to eat inside. 

Also, in the summer get the lemonade... it's fresh squeezed and delicious. If you fancy a soup, get the butternut squash, it's unreal and somehow they don't use cream to make it. 

Eat here, you'll never regret it. I now eat fish regularly because of this place. 

(Also, note that for one week a year they shut down for family vacation... like fully shut down. This place is the definition of family run and they love what they do, so usually in Jan or Feb they close it down for a week of family vacation)"}
{"text":"I love fish, especially fresh fish that is cooked perfectly. That's exactly what you'll get when you come to this tiny mom and pop shop.

After having a few bites at another restaurant on College, my friend and I decided to try The Fish Store & Sandwiches. We only had room for something small, so we decided to share an order of Arctic Char fish tacos. Each of the four tacos was filled with two chunky pieces of fish that was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection, along with some lettuce and red onions. (It was our first time trying Arctic Char, and we both felt it tastes similar to salmon but lighter, less fishy.)

The tacos came with a sauce that tasted a lot like that gingery, vinegary salad dressing you get at Japanese restaurants plus sesame oil. It was pretty good and it made the fish tacos that much better.

The shop itself is very small. But you can see a display of all the fish available behind the counter (for food order and for sale, like any other fish market). 

I am looking forward to my next visit to The Fish Shop & Sandwiches so I can try their fish sandwiches. They look delicious..!"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish  sandwiches made right there and then with ample flavour and mouth-watering taste. I had randomly found this place while reading blogs and I'm quite surprised there aren't more reviews for this place yet. Nestled in Little Italy a few blocks west of bathurst, this little hole in the wall store doesn't really boast a lot of decor. There is a selection of fresh fish inside, a drinks display, cash register and kitchen. There is a small outdoors patio where a handful of people can sit and enjoy their meal. For approximately $8-$10 you are given only a sandwich. Accompaniments are charged extra. I recommend going with the catch of the day if you don't know which fish to get. Don't worry about how to get it seasoned, the cooks take care of it!

Overall, it's a protein-rich healthy meal with flavour. I enjoy that. Will return!"}
{"text":"Only tried it once and that was their salmon sandwich. Should have tried it with the avocado (I could see how that would totally bump it up in terms of awesomeness).

In my rush to devour that delectable, moist, flavourful sandwich, I managed to spill some on my shirt. I suppose it was just that good.

Really can't add anything that new to the deluge of great reviews about this tiny place aside from that."}
{"text":"Cheap hole in the wall with tasty fish sandwiches and nice proprietors? I dig it, big time."}
{"text":"What a brilliant idea! A fish store that sells fish tacos and salads etc. to boot. I've been wanting to try this place for years and when I finally did this past summer I was not disappointed. It's not like you couldn't make your fish tacos yourself at home (in fact I did, a few weeks later). But they're super fresh delicious, inexpensive, and a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best fish sandwiches in the Toronto. The Arctic Char is my particular favourite. So so tasty. Quite expensive but I don't mind because the fish is so good. Would recommend if you like fish."}
{"text":"First time going today and definitely not my last

Best fish sandwiches I've ever had!

Started off the with sea bass and clam chowder, f-ing tasty

Ordered the grouper to go, while polishing that one off on the street car

Seating space is extremely limited as I shared my table with two guests, seems like it can only seat 4 people at a time but if you are just grabbing take you'll be fine

Everything is extremely fresh

It can get pricey since you'd want to try everything off the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to the highly anticipated fish store. Got the Manhattan Chowder which is seafood chowder in tomato broth...It was nice.

Got the fish of the day: Tilapia...It was very nice, with the portugese bread...Got the famous 'Grouper' and that was a HIT...Got the scallops as well...

This place is a nice place to come by and eat once in a while to get your daily fresh fish intake compared to eating street meat..."}
{"text":"I Was in Toronto for a meeting. Heard about this little shack. Really really good fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Let's get the first thing straight. I love fish. But I hate cooking it indoors for obvious reasons. Now let's talk about how awesome the fish store is. Great sandwiches or plates  made with any kind of fish you can think of. The two I've tried is grouper and tuna. They make the sandwhich with nice fresh bread, lightly fried fish, a pesto sauce and lemon. I usually add acacia do to that (make sure you ask for it in the sandwhich otherwise they give it to you on the side for some reason.) I love the hole in the wall look and mom+pops feel of this place too. Must try for fish lovers in Toronto."}
{"text":"GF was craving something light for lunch so we decided to pop by. 

First let me say I don't normally like eating fish unless it's battered and deep fried but this was great!

This is a small place with only 2 tables but would be perfect for a summer day.

Upon entering you're greeted with fresh fish laid out on a bed of ice. You actually get to see what your piece of fish looks like! Choose between sandwich, wrap, salad or dinner, grab a seat and just wipe the drool from your mouth as you smell them cook up your meal!

I had the halibut and the GF had the Artic Char both were flavorful and moist. Only thing I would change, and this is more of a personal preference,  is less 'sauce' as it was a little bit too vinegary for me but nonetheless a great meal."}
{"text":"Looks like a little hole in the wall but reminds me of a little fishmonger market. No fuss just good fish. 

We had the fish tacos with grouper and they were served with a sesame sauce and lemon wedge - perfectly fresh and satisfying flavour."}
{"text":"Darnit. The secret seems to be out on this place. In past months, I was the only person there around dinnertime but yesterday, the joint was \"swimming\" (tee hee) with customers! 

They've opened their patio which allows a few more patrons to sit and eat but there was a steady \"stream\" (OK, I'll stop) of takeout customers around 7 o'clock on a Thursday, resulting in a 20-minute wait for food. The owner even had to make a run to the bakery because they ran out of bread!

The wild salmon sandwich ($8.45) is always amazing and it's even better with their perfectly-ripe, buttery avocado for an extra dollar.

A lot of the eat-in diners ordered the fish meal with their choice of fish so I might try that next time when I \"catch\" (sorry, I can't help it!) an empty table."}
{"text":"I went to Fish Store and Sandwiches for lunch, with high expectation as many of the reviews are excellent. I ordered grouper taco and my friends salmon salads.I was so disappointed, what I got for my taco was cheap Basa and not grouper at all, I could see why there have been much promotion for the \"grouper\". The salmon salads my friend had were few very thinly cut strips of salmon and not at all worthy of the price they charged."}
{"text":"lame ... halibut sandwich for $14.41. laced with balsamic bs. went to king slice after because I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Nice little place, that makes nice little sandwiches, by nice little people.

A work colleague dragged me here during lunch time.  Apparently he read some positive reviews online about this joint (the ones written by you people, I assume) and told me that it is something that I just had to try.

And boy, am I glad that I did!  I am a huge seafood lover, so this place is kind of a paradise for me.  I mean, they don't really have shell fish, but I loved the fresh flavours.

You don't see shops like this too often.  Little store, but big flavours."}
{"text":"Great food. Really loved the atmosphere and quality of service. Really am thankful to my friend for pointing out this place. Overall the fish store has by far the greatest and freshest tasting fish all over toronto. Would I recommend this restaurant? Definitely yes!"}
{"text":"Tasty food; the tuna sandwich is light and fragrant; vinaigrette topped with onions lettuce tomato and coriander it's a very comfortable eat. The clam chowder is light and delicious, though I prefer my chowders thicker. No seating really; max seats for 16 including all the individual stools. Good for eating alone or with a small group of 2-4"}
{"text":"Great fish sandwich- was missing the sauce but overall was quite good. For $11 it didn't come with any sides - may be a bit of salad would have been great."}
{"text":"Yeeee. After having ZERO life due to work travel/time-consuming project work, I'm back to unleash nerdy reviews upon the universe. Also: I moved to a new playbourhood, which brings me to the topic at hand.. fish sanniches.

Last night, aka my first official night in Little Italy (YAY!!), I drank a latte and was WIRED as a result. As I speed-walked along College, I bemembered the 'Kat Eats A Fish Sandwich' event that I sadly missed, and came to the conclusion that I MUST purchase myself a fish sandwich immediately. This was to be my first dinner in the new lair.  

The Fish Store is adorable and spectacular. It fits about 3.5 people, and there are two tables (apparently a patio opens up when the weather turns nice). Laid out before you are about 10-15 different fresh fish choices, and it is your duty to say, \"I want THAT one.\" Then they make you a sandwich. 

While I waited, I ooo'd and ahhhh'd over the selection of \"BEST SAMMICH!!1!!\" newspaper clippings on the wall. Then...

Wonderfully grilled fresh fish, a pillowy bun, optional avocado (yes!!!!) placed in my trembling hands. I lugged the giant thing home with a fresh-squeezed lemonade and shoved it into my gullet in front of The Bachelor. Classy! Good thing there was nobody else around though, cause like.. what a mess."}
{"text":"It's fresh. So fresh that I'm sure if the fish's head was still on, it would be winking at you :)

I love this place for a few reasons. For one, it's a mom and pop shop, and I like supporting small businesses. Also, the quality of their dishes is 5 star. Every single item that goes into their Sandwiches, Salads, Tacos, Soups, etc. is well thought out, and sourced based on quality.

The last time I was here I had the Arctic Char Salad, and it was exquisite. Light and fresh, with a great lemony vinaigrette. Truly, this is food you can feel good about eating.

I would be bold to say that the Sandwich is their best seller. I've had it on numerous occasions with different types of fish, and have been very satisfied each time. The success of this sandwich has a lot to do with the fresh fish, and also this perfect bread that they source from a Portuguese Bakery. It's crusty on the outside, and squishy on the inside, just the way I like it.

I was there one time when they were just about to close, and the owners were telling me that bread that's not used on the same day is turned into breadcrumbs for other preparations. That in itself demonstrated to me how committed they are to quality.

Fish lovers will dig this place. Non-Fish eaters will come here with apprehension, and leave wondering why they ever denounced Salmon. It's a win-win for all!"}
{"text":"It hits the spot.

It's fresh. It's clean. It's fast and good and cheap.

Worth trying at least once for all of you who have passed this place multiple times and wondered."}
{"text":"Best fucking place in the world. Fresh fish simply prepared..healthy meal without the fuss.

I go all the time. Cash only of course."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the BEST fish I've ever eaten, fast food or not.  As fresh as you can get without catching it yourself.  While I was eating my sandwich I had wished I was hungrier so I could try each of the fish on the menu.

I would/could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I live close by and get a pickerel dinner with avocado and extra veggies probably too often, but it's a super healthy meal so what'evs. 

It's easy to miss this place as it's a bit of a whole in the wall. Very nice folks and lots of regulars here for lunch or, like me, on the way home. Our family of free regularly split two dinners as the portions are fair - so a good, easy take out meal for $30. Great option in the warmer months when they have tables out front.

Cash only They open for lunch and close early, around 8:00 pm."}
{"text":"Pick a niche and do it well! Very Basic spot, very basic options, very fresh fish, very well done concept- perfect healthy summer lunch:D"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch place.  It's tiny - two cramped tables for two, and no standing room - but cozy.  Owners are always friendly and make good recommendations.  Most importantly, the food is just consistently great.  Sandwiches and soups are always awesome.  Been there several times now, and the tilapia remains my fave.

Caveat - be prepared to wait 10 minutes for your sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a small shop on College Street that sells fish sandwiches and the like. There are two tables inside, but given the cramped space, this is more of a takeaway place.

But the fish burrito, sandwich and butternut squash soup we ordered were excellent, so I definitely recommend this place.

They also give you a mint after your meal, 'because nobody likes fish breath'. Touche."}
{"text":"I've heard about the fish store a few times, but have not had the chance to visit it until today..... And I wish I would have come sooner!

I ordered the fish sandwich, which consisted of grilled grouper, lettuce, tomato and cheese (possibly mayonaise?)  and it was amazing!

There doesn't seem to be much space inside for seating, but there was a patio with about 15 seats that was quite full when I went there, right in the middle of the lunch hour.  My recommendation is to come when you aren't in a hurry, because they are quite busy during lunch.

I really want to go back!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try The Fish Store for a while after reading so many positive reviews. I was expecting an out-of-this-world fish sandwich but I didn't think it was all that. I love that it's a cute little mom-and-pop place, and that their service is really ...gentle. I used to think this little cubby-hole of a resto seemed out of place in Little Italy but the area has been changing a lot over the last couple of years. The night we stopped in was a chilly one and while I feared walking out smelling like grease--surprisingly, we didn't. 

When we arrived, we were ecstatic that we didn't have to wait too long because the place is pretty tiny and that would have meant standing in the cold. The trio of staff all got up from their table in the corner to get working on our order. We were just two, looking for a quick and cheap bite. We got the tilapia and grouper, both served up on a Portuguese bun, which, if you've never had one it's a bit chewy on the outside but fluffy and airy on the inside--perfect for a fish sandwich. I really wanted the black cod (the selection varies slightly from day to day) but was in the mood for a sandwich and didn't want to ruin the joy of such a great fish with a bun and other dressings. Both sandwiches contained juicy grilled fliets of fish, and came with lettuce and tomato. They would have been perfect with some kind of mayo concoction or aioli but instead there was something else along with lime salt which wasn't bad but a sauce would've been better and given it a heartier taste, I think. We grabbed a couple of cans of pop (they sell San Pellegrino sodas for pretty cheap) and wolfed down our sandwiches. I don't recall how much we paid but it was in the $20 range.  

As we were being served, suddenly people began to pour in. From the sounds of things, they didn't seem like first-timers so it looks like The Fish House has a following.
I like that there were many fish to choose from and different options: served on rice, with greens, or on a bun. Next time I'll try a better fish with rice. When we got up to leave, one of the staff urged us to take a piece of gum. He was so endearing~"}
{"text":"Never lets me down! Sooo good. Just writing this review has got me wanting more 

Great selection of fresh fish. Sandwhich and plate with brown rice are my go to dishes. Wild Salmon is always grilled to perfection. Their avocado side is  real fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing. Huge fish selection all fresh. Sauted and put on a delicious bun. And a GREAT price."}
{"text":"Awesome fish.

Try to figure out when they get it shipped in so I can get the freshest sandwich...the dude said \"everyday\", which can't be right- either way- it's very good.

I think the salad is the best buy- it's the same price as the wrap and the sandwich... (wraps are the smallest). The salad would even be better if they used spinach instead of iceberg- or at least have that option. 

It's a good spot- and a nice alternative to quick sandwiches with lots of pulled pork.


-closed on sundays- which is annoying on lovely little italian weekends."}
{"text":"Halibut sandwich was delicious. Very small joint but unique and interesting. Definitely swing by when you're in the area"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish sandwich. The fish is fresh, grilled and seasoned just right. I have been to the Fish Store several times and the grilled grouper sandwich is consistently wonderful. The sandwich's greatness comes from its simplicity. It has few ingredients, choice of fish, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a splash of balsamic on top of a soft whole wheat bun. Simple, fresh and consistently great!
There are a few tables outside which make this place a nice lunch spot."}
{"text":"The one place I've been going to for the last 5 years. Pretty sure will continue to go for the next 10 years.... great food, great vibe, friendly owners. A good choice for a summery sunny  weekend."}
{"text":"LOVED this charming, cozy, family-owned and run hole-in-the-wall establishment. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are cut right next to the fish refrigerator, encasing a wide selection of fish like salmon, shrimp, cod, talapia, etc. Concept: you pick the meat (specials change daily, but prices are usually consistent i.e., salmon is $6.99 for a sandwich. Fish is marinated with a special blend of spices, which all fold into a soft roll. No extra sauce needed. But we discovered a cinnamon-ade ($3.50 will get you a 16 ounces of refreshing accompaniment to the sandwiches. Once grouper sandwich + white fish burrito + large cinnamon-ade for just under $20 CAD. I will definitely return and recommend this place for anyone who enjoys supporting the moms and pops establishments while indulging in fresh, tasty food for cheap!"}
{"text":"Great little place great family service.  Amazing seafood soup.  U can choose whatever fresh fish u like"}
{"text":"I love this place oh so very much. Three things:

1. It's cheap-- really cheap. Fish burger for $5 and it's filling. Yum.
2. It's delicious. Perfectly grilled fish on a bun. Nuff said.
3. The people who run the place are super friendly and seem to love what they're doing.

Best fish sandwiches in Toronto, hands down.

Psssst: Don't go in with the intention of sitting down though. It's SUPER small. In the summer, they do have some nice outdoor seating though."}
{"text":"Salmon with rice and Avacado was amazing. Healthy & Delicious!. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, was a pretty small shop with a little porch can't miss the blue store though. Got the classic grouper sandwich, simple, clean and fresh eat! Around $10, wasn't full but at a good place."}
{"text":"**3.5**

Before all the Fish Store lovers hate on me, let me just say the fish here is amazing! It tastes great! 

My issue is with the size of the place and the quantity of fish. Mr. H had the wild salmon and I had the grouper fish both were cooked really well. Loved the food but I wish I had more quantity of fish (Mr.H said that I could have paid extra for it but I didn't see the sign the says so anywhere) My rice plate consisted of brown rice, some sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and broccoli, along with some olives. I got avocado for a dollar extra. 

Overall I would love to try this place again and maybe I'll give the sandwich version a try."}
{"text":"The sandwich there was amazing !! The fish was fresh! I had the grouper and it was on point! I also got the avocados, but it was really hard to put it in the sandwich since it was already really full. Definitely recommend it to everyone who loves fish!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the small-ness of the inside of the resto. This is the ideal place to pick up a quick fish sandwich on your way to the park or for a quick lunch while shopping on College Street. Of the group, those who asked to eat in got much larger portions than the take-out crowd.  
The restaurant is really a shelf full of fresh fish and don't look too far to the left, that's where they do all the wonderful cooking.  
Fish is not meant to be deep fried- hallaluah!!  Grilled and served as burritos, sandwiches or salads, the fish is fresh and tasty.  I would highly suggest the sandwich because the bread is soft and hot and toasty. Buttery like a croissant, but big like the Vietnamese rolls.  
I enjoyed the Black Cod, but next time, I'm eyeing the wild salmon!"}
{"text":"A fish store, smack dabbed in the middle of Little Italy - that I found intriguing. 

I've found myself passing by this quaint lil' mom &  pop joint, a lot in the past year, and finally decided to check it out. 
In all the times I've past by, they've always been super busy. That's a good sign, right? 

Don't get me wrong - food wasn't bad. But I expected much more. 
We ordered the grouper fish burger and Haddock tacos. The fish portions were tiny, kinda cold & generally under-seasoned. 

In the middle of the small seating area, were two bins for trash, and one for dirty dishes. It was just left on the floor to sit, with flies hanging around. 

One day we'll be back to chance the claim chowder & sandwiches, but meh."}
{"text":"- big reason this place is averaging 4.5 stars is that the food is dynamite.
- very simple grilled fish served up in 1 of 4 ways of your choosing from portugese bread sandwich, tacos, brown rice, or a 4th i cant remember....
- from arctic char to salmon to halibut to cod to grouper to whatever the daily special is, you have plenty of choice!!
- go there now."}
{"text":"I love it when friends tell me where to eat.  It's usually the other way around, but take it from me - you can always learn from those around you, whether it's food, fashion, or life.  That's right, I'm deep - I have many layers much like an onion :)


An old friend, let's make him the Jimmy Neutron to my Cindy Vortex?  She's one of my many alter-egos.  Yes, that works.  See Jimmy is one of those brainiac friends - the kind who espouse world facts and know all the nuances of politics and culture...blah blah.  He will always be my intellectual rival because no one makes my brain work harder.  


He and I go way back, circa 2000?!?  A month or so ago he told me about this mom-and-pop fish store owned by a Korean family (WE LOVE KOREAN PEOPLE).  It's nothing fancy, just fresh fish sandwiches.  Gasp, why have I never heard of this.  Probably because I have tunnel vision.  But that's why I have such an eclectic group of friends.  They remind me that I don't, in fact, know everything.  It still comes as a shock...no matter how many times I get schooled.


A couple days ago Jimmy and I took a nice walk along College to The Fish Store.  It has limited (and I mean limited) seating.  It's a cute patio and we got there in time to grab a seat.  Jimmy was not exaggerating when he said fresh fish.  It's set up like a mini fish market.  You pick your fish they make your dish.  Hey hey, that should be there tagline.  I decided on the bass, Jimmy had the halibut.


I tried the Manhattan clam chowder too.  It was good but I would rather have two sandwiches and skip the soup.  You live and learn right.  


Say hello to my little sandwich:

 
Buttery bass 

Say hello to Jimmy's:

 
 

Simple concept, really, really good.  I was impressed.  And it takes a lot to impress a gal like me."}
{"text":"Simply delicious fish a purple rice combos with avocado and salad.  Sandwiches are amazing as well. I regularly go for healthy, fresh and tasty lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"My grouper was not seasoned very good, it was bland, dry, and had no texture. Maybe alittle slimy but not pleasant. My dad got a fried fish sandwhich and that was great! Good bread, great crunch, and seasoned great! All in all if you go, I wouldn't reccomend the grouper at all!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish sandwiches are melt in your mouth delicious with a big piece of fresh fish of our choice prepared right in front of you, fresh tomato and lettuce and optional avacado, and jam all of that into the Portuguese bun, take a bite and tell me you can't believe you've never eaten here before. That's usually how it go goes. The fish tacos are a new favourite. Pair it with their homemade lemonade. You HAVE to try this place."}
{"text":"I think my expectations were a tad high for this one.  Yelpers gave it 4.5 stars!  The sandwiches were good.  Well prepared halibut and scallops, fresh bread and simple toppings.  I think some sea salt would have elevated the flavours a bit.  The seasoning they used just didn't have enough kick and I didn't want to slather on hot sauce.  Very friendly and efficient service, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the arctic char sandwich which was the daily special for $6.99.  They gave a good portion with lettuce tomato and onion with a balsamic vinaigrette.  The fish tasted so fresh and was not overcooked.  The bread used is perfect with the delicate fish.  The store is smaller than expected with a total of four seats inside.  I will definitely be back because they have mastered the fish sandwich."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)
I'm a fan of seafood and I love fish.  I've heard about how good the Fish store and sandwiches was and I wanted to come here for along time.  I knew that the store was small but I didn't realize how really small it was.  It is very small.  There were only two small tables that were cramped into each other at the right corner of the store in front of the cash register. They also have an open space outside, a patio that can accommodate few more tables in summer.  I wish I was here when it wasn't cold like today.

Food wasn't bad but it wasn't tasty that I expected.  Maybe my expectation was too high after reading many good reviews. 

We ordered the Fish of the day \"Grouper\" with brown rice, added on avocado $1.25.  The price was good because we chose the fish of the day for the dish.  We also ordered 
a Halibut sandwich.  My husband said it was very good but it was a bit pricey because it was halibut!  Haha :D   I saw they had soup so I decide to try Clam chowder.  It was good even though the seafood inside was little hard.  However, it was good for the price $3.99.  I kinda like it. 

Overall it was ok except the portion of the fish was a bit smaller than I thought.  I think it's better for doing take-out, not for dine-in though.  If you're in the area, it's not a bad idea to order for take-home.  

P.S.  I gave this place 3.5 stars for the overall experience, not only the food.   If they had a bigger place for dine-in and were more attentive to customers, I would have given them 4 stars.  Don't get me wrong. They look friendly but I felt that the service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a small joint that has delicious and fresh seafood. It's a great spot to go to in the summer time. Not so in the winter if you want to sit down. The halibut sandwich was very flavourful and the bun was super soft. Really yummy! I've had the wild salmon and the rainbow trout on rice before and both comes with korean rice and miso sauce that goes amazing with the fish. Though I would like the fish to be grilled and not pan fried. The flavour of the food makes up for it! Go if you are close by!"}
{"text":"I came here with one of my exes and the food is phenomenal. This place is a great little secret in the college area. The fish is fresh and scrumptious. The prices are really great as well. I highly recommend it and hope I can go back sometime soon. :)"}
{"text":"Like Susan C and Kat T, I was there to witness Kat F chomp on some salmon. She didn't puke or gag. 

The place is uber tiny. Could use a coat of fresh paint outside, but it works and serves a great simple and effective purpose. My calamari sandwich was tasty and refreshing. I never thought I would use the word refreshing when describing a sandwich, but it was the first thought that entered into my head while I was chowing down. I think it was the fresh ingredients (beautiful calamari, not those ass-ified round rings that are like rubber, tomatoes, onions, lemon and seasoning). 

I loved how the place did not smell like fish. 
I loved how the place displays the fresh fish (think of St. Lawrence Market) 
I loved how the owners took such pride in their business 

I did make the mistake of using the bathroom. Wow. Small...closet....not uber dirty, but there was a bucket with stagnant water in the corner. 

Go for the calamari on a delish bun. 
Don't go for the bathroom."}
{"text":"Ordered a salmon taco.  The price is a bit high for $11.25 (with tax included) for 4 of them.  The miso inspired sauce was interesting to pair with the salmon.  Overall the taste was pretty good.  I would order again to try different stuff."}
{"text":"Not disappointed but certainly underwhelmed.  The two women eating gushed about the place as I stool looking at the menu.
It was fine.  Nothing special.  Quite bland.  And $10 is expensive for a sandwich at what is not much more than a street stall.  You pay extra for avocado but then the avocado is served as a side dish.
Not sold on the product or concept.  Won't bother again."}
{"text":"This place is as good (or better) than the other reviews claim! I made it down here after reading all the raves.  I'm not even a huge fish fan, but I had to try it out.  Now I think maybe I actually am a huge fish fan.  There's a great selection of fish here, we tried three different kinds and they were all great.  Fresh, juicy.

Keep in mind there is no indoor seating, so keep that in mind as the winter approaches."}
{"text":"If you love fish then you got to come here! They have a good selection of fresh fish. You also have the choice of getting your fish done on a sandwich, taco, salad or a burrito.  I tried the catfish sandwich and a salmon burrito and it was just fantastic! The owners are really nice people. I was getting take out today and the man seen me watching my car out front so I can look out for parking enforcement. He was nice enough to tell me to wait in my car so I wouldn't get a ticket and volunteered to bring my food to me when my order was ready. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because they accept cash only. So make sure you hit up your bank ATM before hand."}
{"text":"Amazing! Wish there was one in NYC.

The service is awesome. It takes about 3 mins for them to cook your order from scratch. Hard to believe but it is an open kitchen so you see them doing it.

The Wild Salmon I had was awesome. I followed it up with a shrimp burger and that was great too.

I'm in Toronto for 2 more days and I'll be coming here on each one to try as many different kinds of fish as possible"}
{"text":"Excellent food that's healthy if youre craving fish. The brown rice tastes good even though its not the best however there is no white rice option. I tried the wild salmon dish so far with avocado yummy. Only cash and very small seating area"}
{"text":"Regular Fish Sandwich: Simple but very good. 

Soup (Dont remember which one): Very very bad 1 out of 5.

I was shocked because of the difference in quality between soup and sandwich, though i only rated the sandwich."}
{"text":"SO FRESH! This is THE place to go if you love fresh fish and don't want to spend your life savings to get it. 

The shop is incredibly small. There's barely enough space to walk. There are 2 small tables inside, good for 2 people each. There are some tables outside but in the winter you probably don't want to eat outside. Don't worry, they do take out! 

There isn't much in terms of service or decor but all this can easily be overlooked because they aren't trying to be a full service restaurant. This is a FISH STORE that also cooks some of their stock so anyone that deducts stars for service isn't being fair. Besides, there's something really heart warming about seeing a family cook for you. 

The basic stuff (fish + salad/burrito/rice/sandwich) will come out around $10 each. They have more expensive fish like seabass or black cod. Definitely worth it considering you're getting some of the freshest cooked fish in Toronto. I had fish with rice. It comes with this sesame garlic sauce and it's awesome. 

Definitely a fan and will come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"love love LOVE the fish store! 

It's a humble mom and pop shop with unpretentious menu but surprisingly tasty. The first time i went i was a little skeptical as it just look like a corner store with two Asians moms and a pop standing by a grill and cash register. I was happily surprised by the quality. There's also complimentary gum for diners post meal to get rid of their fish breathe! 

It's perfect for the summer when you can sit in the patio and people watch. Even non fish lovers will enjoy. The sandwich is on very good baguette and the rice dish is also very good. 

One star taken off for not a big portion."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for over a year now and I foolishly overlooked The Fish Store until just recently. I must admit, it is easy to not notice, given how tiny and generally nondescript the restaurant is.

So far, I have only tried several of their fishes as a meal. The meal consists of your choice of fish, lemon slice, brown rice, slices of cucumber and tomato, dressing, and olives. 

In my opinion, it is the perfect take out meal. Several types of fresh fish (ie. salmon, wild salmon, rainbow trout, tilapia, grouper, black cod, etc) is available and seared and seasoned to perfection. It's not under or overcooked, this family has fish down to an art. Nothing is deep fried, just grilled.

It is placed on a generous portion of brown rice, which has a nice consistency and I think is flavoured with plum. A container of dressing (a delicious ginger/miso/sesame seed combination I believe?) with slices of fresh cucumber and tomato also accompany it. I love drenching the cucumber and tomato with the dressing and just eating it like that. The dressing is heavenly! Slices of avocado is also optional for an additional $1.25 (if I remember correctly), which compliments the fish very well.

If you're looking for a delicious, cheap, but healthy take-out alternative, definitely check out the Fish Store. My only problem with this place is that I crave it almost every night! It's becoming a bit of an obsession."}
{"text":"It was ok.. Tastes like a salad I would make.. I guess because I'm a suburb dude I don't really appreciate the convenience of food like this because I have to drive like 2 time zones to get here... The grouper had no flavor, not even really seasoned... Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The ideal place if you're looking for a light, healthy meal (which can be impossible to find in downtown these days!)

I'm so happy to have found this place! Although I'm not the biggest fish fanatic, I may have changed my mind after this meal. Both my boyfriend and I ordered the fish on rice (I ordered wild salmon, and he had the grouper, which was the daily special). We had to get the avocado as well. What really amazed me was the bed of fish behind the cash register that is cooked especially for your order. No frozen fish or that nonsense. 

The fish came very quickly to our table. My first impression was how nicely the meal was platted and how adorable the colours blended together. It came with a side sauce that looks suspicious but tasted sweet and vinegary and sesame-ey (bomb). The salmon that I had tasted fresh, flavourful but not overpowering. I had a bite of the grouper and it had the smoothest texture! The purple brown rice was an excellent touch as well, something you only find in traditional korean restaurants, but fitted perfectly with the rest of the meal. 

I must say that other than the asparagus, the other vegetables are completely unseasoned, which is FINE. Just a heads up. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back for the fish tacos and sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you just walk by this place but don't give it a try, you would never know this hidden gem can be that amazing!  I didn't know such a cute store exists until I read the other yelpers' review. They were absolutely right on this.  

The store itself is so tiny, you can barely fit 5-6 customers there at the same time.  It's a mom and pop kind of place afterall.  You order the type of fish you like (the fish selection lies on a bed of ice, and yeah it smells a little fishy), and then you order the other toppings, whether you want bread, or salad, or rice to come with the fish.  They also list their daily special fish on the board.  Price varies from $7 to $12, depends on the type of fish.

We've ordered the clam chowder soup, one halibut sandwich, one daily special (grouper) sandwich, and a wild sockeye salmon salad.  We were told to wait about 15-20 mins while the fish was grilled.  The fish was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The soup was less creamy and thick than what you normally have in other restaurants, but still it had enough clams. What amazed me was that the bread was so fresh and fluffy!

We went there around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and we still saw streams of customers coming in.  I can imagine how busy this place would become during its rush hour.  You can either wait outside where there is a tiny patio, or you can walk out and come back in 10-15 mins.  Trust me, it's all worth it!

And yes I'm a fish person ~ I just love fish!"}
{"text":"Grouper sandwich and lemonade, healthy and amazing!

I am usually not a fan of healthy food, but this was the best fish sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"It has successfully achieved the impossible-trinity of my lunching needs:
1. Great value: fresh seafood and quality ingredients for ~$10. Yes please.
2. Delicious: mmm...perfectly grilled fish with avocados
3. Healthy.

Sole good, you cod say, The Fish Shop has me hooked."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on College street by far.  Huge selection of fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich ever! I tried both cod and grouper fish. Sooo good! The area is fantastic as well. This is a small restaurant and barely 10 people can fit inside. The fish is fresh and there is a variety to choose from. I had fish sandwich here a couple of times and I will definitely come back for more, with more peeps!"}
{"text":"This spot is unreal.  Not a hard decision.  Get a fresh fish sandwich and enjoy.  

Don't even worry about the sauce. They make it perfectly seasoned.  


Will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought about giving this a 4, but it really does deserve the 5. Were there things that could have been better? Sure. But I got bang for my buck and service was outstanding. 

I ordered the fish burger, which was $4.99 + tax. It was more a fish sandwich than a burger, given that it was a grouper fillet, and not a patty. I'd rather it as a sandwich. More fish for me! The bun to grouper ratio was decent. There was lettuce, tomato, and processed cheese on my burger as well, which was surprisingly generous of them. To my recollection, there was no sauce, but it didn't need sauce. The grouper was cooked to order, the bun was toasted, and because the bun and grouper were hot, the cheese was melty. The grouper was very juicy, and seasoned just right. It was definitely the star of the show.

I'm guessing this is mostly a takeout place. There's one table for two inside, but the store itself is awkwardly shaped and it's difficult to get in and out of if someone else is standing inside. They do have a table or two outside in their tiny patio, but it was raining that day, so I didn't want to eat outside. I was waiting inside, sitting on a stool. When my order was ready, the owner told me to sit, moved a table over for me, and moved a chair from outside in so I could sit inside. It was incredibly kind of him, especially because I said he really didn't have to do that for me. 

If you like fish sandwiches, this is a great one for a fantastic price. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Fantastic seafood dinner!!!
Very reasonable price!  Will be a regular"}
{"text":"A bit if a small store and only two small tables for two are afforded on the inside. But it only adds to the coziness of the family-operated store. The quality of the food and the friendliness of the owners more than make up for it. As for the dinner, the sandwiches and tacos were very well done, and a great value with the combo deal (comes with greens and a soup). Worth the trek."}
{"text":"Not a huge fish fan but this place did have some great fish sandwiches. Was a little pricey though seeing they weren't as filling as I had hoped. 

Only two, two seat tables inside with a few picnic tables on the outside so better for takeout when it gets chilly outside."}
{"text":"Lovvve, love love this place!! 

The place is tiny, and smells like fish, small price to pay for easily one of the consistently best sandwiches in the city! 

The bread is soft, chewy and delicious. The fish is SO fresh, soft, perfectly cooked and marinated. Not spicy enough for my liking, but they have sriracha so it's all good. Sandwich also has lettuce and tomatoes and is surprisingly filling.

I would recommend getting the basic grouper as it tastes good and isn't expensive. I used to get the black cod everytime I went here thinking it would be tastier and less fishy, but I took a chance on the grouper the other day and realized that it doesn't really matter what fish you get!

I however wouldn't recommend the soups. They were bland and actually just plain bad.

Stick to the sandwiches and you won't go wrong!

Would I return? Till this place closes down!"}
{"text":"The Fish Store is the EXACT reason why I love Yelp. I've walked by it at least a hundred times and never thought about even giving it a glance until I read all the fantastic reviews and thank goodness.

If you're looking for a nice light (not light as in small portions, but light as in you won't feel bloated or nasty in anyway) lunch or dinner with the most refreshing flavours, give one of these amazing sandwiches a try! 

When you walk into the \"shack\" you eyes fix on the fresh fish on display that will soon be in your tummy and you realize for the price you're paying you're actually getting a decent amount of fish. I ordered the clam chowder soup as well and although it wasn't what I was expecting (I like my clam chowders a little chunky) it was still pretty tasty.

My absolute favourite part of coming to the Fish Store however is the bread they serve the sandwiches on!! Nice and crispy on the outside but surprisingly thin and airy and it won't get soggy or break apart!!! 

I can't wait to go to The Fish Store again!"}
{"text":"Cool looking set up. Walk up, good service, quick. 
I appreciated the salmon sandwich, just doesn't love it (I'm not the biggest fan of fish, you might wanna skip my review!)."}
{"text":"this is about the cutest store ive ever seen...if you can say that about a fish store.

it smells like fish intensely when you walk in.  then your olfactory fatigue sets in and you bask in the seafaring decorations and tablecloths  they help to call this place their home away from home.

the place itself is like a triangular sliver of a place.  its like no one knew what to do with this strange spot and these guys just slithered in here and made it fantastic.  i feel like theyve used every inch of space they could in an efficient way. 

it seems this place is owned by a japanese couple, hence the excellent use of space.  there are a couple tables, covered with the blue and white checkered tablecloths.  behind those tables is a miniature black and white portable tv.  around that are many drinks, magazines, condiments, and other items related to seafood for sale.

i ordered the special for the day which was a combo of homemade clam chowder and a calamari sandwich.  this was all for ten bucks.  both of them were awesome.  the clam chowder even seemed to have extra bits of seafood in it.  it was hot, creamy and plentiful.  the sandwich was in the freshest of buns, with lettuce, spiced and fried calamari and a little lemon for good measure.

as i was sitting there eating a crabby looking woman in a parka waddled in and asked about the specials for the day.  she was allergic to calamari so she opted for another fish atop a salad.  she had to go get cash (as they only take cash) and proceeded to horde a bunch of free gum that the owners leave out for customers in a little box that has a sign on it saying \"no one likes fishy breath, take a piece of gum.\"  i guess for her that meant free is free, so there.  the owner looked at the box when she left for her money, shook his head with a smile and i asked him what happened (i hadnt noticed that box until this incident).  he sort of gave a shrug of the shoulders, we both giggled and that was that.  he still treated her with the same respect he had before the gum incident.

the food, the owners, the atmosphere are all stellar."}
{"text":"I had arrived to The Fish Store during the time Little Italy was occuring. I am a huge fan of crispy battered fish served in corn tortillas, so ordered the fish tacos. Looking at the menu picture, the fish was not deep fried, and the tortillas were not corn, but in fact the usual flour tortillas.

The fish of the day was wild salmon, and at first I thought this would be a strange choice for a fish taco, you never can go wrong with the freshest fish available.

The service was quick and friendly. After paying the expensive price of $11 for the four fish tacos, I was delightfully surprised by the flavour. Not only was the salmon moist and flavoured nicely, the wasabi miso sauce served alongside it only enhanced the fish tacos taste. The blanket of crisp leafy green vegetables with the tomatoes and cucumber just made everything served on the plate taste great. Amazing overall, just a little pricey at almost $3 a taco"}
{"text":"If you guys want a fresh, healthy home made seafood that has special recipe, I highly recommend this place . 
Sandwich with daily Portuguese bread, grilled fresh with brown rice
Nothing is unhealthy in this place. 

My favorite thing from that fish store,  Manhattan soup !
You should try!"}
{"text":"My kinda EATS! It's the place that you want to keep secret!

Fresh fish, grilled and smothered in balsamic and fresh herbs, nestled in a fresh made bun and served with lettuce, tomato and avocado or hot sauce if you wish.

I think the secret is in the herbs and balsamic... SO GOOD!

Totally unassuming, fantastically delicious... Don't tell anyone else but this place is special!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place has such great reviews on here. Maybe I just had a bad experience but when I went here after seeing all the reviews I felt the sandwich was not very good at all. The fish lacked flavour, the bread overpowered the sandwich and there really wasn't much else to it. I will give them another shot one day, but after my first experience I am in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich. Sounds pretty basic but its way beyond basic in terms of taste. I think its all to do with the freshness of the ingredients. Everything was made fresh, the vegetables used, the bread and especially the fish. Frankly I'm not sure where else you can get a freshly grilled fish sandwich other than this place. My favorite so far is the rainbow trout. Each fish seems to have its distinct flavor. It was definitely worth the trip down town and if you need parking there is a little plaza down the road with ample parking."}
{"text":"This place was great for a quick bite! 

Got the clam chowder (this was more like a potato soup with pieces of clam, good, but necessarily a chowder), and perfectly cooked fish in fish tacos with nice sauce pairing (that gave it a very Asian flavour). You get to pick what kind of fish you want in the taco, and it's perfectly cooked. Not the largest portions of fish.

Service is prompt, and they provide after-food gum for no fish breath! BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"Best value for money on college! Fresh, delicious, reliable goodness. The fish plate (vs. the sandwich) is hearty and filling. Make sure to get extra sauce on the side."}
{"text":"As far as fish sandwiches go 
cant think of another place that even comes close
hard working family run operation
great service"}
{"text":"I went here last night. Its a hole in wall, easy to miss. I had the wild salmon sandwich. It was fantastic. Fish was fresh (its also a fish market), came on a nice italian bun with some green leaf lettuce and some balsamic vingar on the bottom. They do put lemon pepper on it, which i could live without (a squeeze of lemon or lime would be way better - i will probably ask them to do that next time). My only other complaint is I need to eat more than one to be full!

Owner is very friendly too. Great find. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What an excellent lunch i just had today
Order the haddock and grouper meal and it was deilcious
A good and healthy meal that hits you right on the spot

Seating is very limited but they have all different kinds of fresh fisht o choose from. You can get the burrito, sandwich, meal or salad all for the same price"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to finally try this place, but I sure am glad I did! The Fish Store has been around for a while and they serve quality fish dishes with fresh ingredients (you can actually see the raw fish on ice). If you are in Little Italy and looking for something fast, yet healthy, this is your best option. Most of the other places around here are shawarma/pizza/burrito places. 

They have a variety of different kinds of fish including some really fancy ones like black cod. For any fish, they grill it fresh to order and you can have it as a sandwich, salad, burrito, or over rice. They don't overseason it, so you can really taste the flavour of the fish. I had the haddock salad ($9.99) and it came over a huge portion of mixed romaine and baby spinach with lots of veggies. In addition to fish, they have soups and cold drinks. Be sure to check out the daily special too!

 The staff are really friendly. Not much seating area, especially in the winter once the patio is closed, just 2 small tables. Most people get take-out. On a Friday night after work when I went, it was very busy! Seems like there are lots of regulars. 

There are so many fish & chips places in the city, but for anyone who wants fast fresh fish without all the grease, this place can't be beat! Prices are very reasonable too! I'm a fan!

NB: Cash only!"}

{"text":"What a delightful place on College St. 

This place is easy to get to with local parking around most of the blocks in this neighborhood. It is a hole in the wall type of place where they have only 2 tables and 2 seats at each table. They also have a stool table for people to eat outside. 

CHEAP - $5 something for FRESH fish burritos that is incredible. Very heatlhy ingredients, and friendly service.  

You can choose from a number of different fish they offer for the day. (Tuna, Salmon, Arctic Cod, Halibut,..... )  When I went, I ordered the Arctic Cod. It was my first time eating that type of fish and it was truly amazing. It tasted like salmon, but more natural goodness of flavor from that type of fish..

I would recommend this place if u like fish =)"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to go here for a long time, but I have a girlfriend who is very particular/doesn't like seafood.

Pretty good spot to grab a good meal in the area for 10 bucks or less. All the ingredients seem fresh. The bun was amazingly soft and might have been my favourite part of the sandwich. I had the catfish sandwich. Catfish being the special at the time. I think they specialise in bottom feeder (cheaper) fish, but do it well! The catfish definitely had some seasoning to it. I also dared to try some of their BBQ sauce on it. And I liked it... The sauce was sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Of course eating fish is healthy (unless one orders the so-called taco, which is nothing other than fried batter fish), but I have mixed feelings about this small outlet.
The Fish Store sells fish apparently, but honestly it is just a no frills and run-down sandwich shop (which looks more like a kiosk). They offer all the usual types of fish like salmon, sole, haddock, grouper and so on as sandwiches and also have options like soup, taco or salad. The advantage here is that they have the fish on ice at the shop and pick and prepare it on order as opposed to ripping open an industrial package.

They typically have a 'special' of the week, but there is nothing special about it as the price is the same as always and every other fish and does not come with any extras. I assume it is a 'special' because the owner wants to sell it for reasons of stock or profitability. They offer an avocado cut and sliced at $1.25 extra as a side.
The sandwiches are typically delicious and are $10 each and could be had in a bun or as a wrap. The owner is Chinese so only accepts cash.
The shop is take-out only in the winter (never mind the cramped table), but has a sidewalk-hugging outdoor fenced area for the summer with 4 tables."}
{"text":"First time here, got the fish of the day sandwich $15.99. I didn't really love it. Kind of small for the price, the fish was fresh but it had a weird sauce on it, balsamic vinegar which overpowered the flavor of the fish."}
{"text":"Wow, this baby's got no love on Yelp since 2010! What's up with that?
Well, you guys are missing out because YUM. I recently tried the shrimp burger at this cozy little hole in the wall, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. I mean, it consisted of  burger buns, lettuce, swiss cheese, onion, tomato, and about 6 sizzling, crunchy shrimp which to my knowledge didn't have too much garnish. Still, the combination was oddly very satisfying. I like my food to have a lot of flavour through sauces, herbs and spices, but the dressing wasn't at all necessary. Great little place."}

We were disappointed when we opened the container coz it doesn't look good,
HOWEVER
We were shocked by the first bite
The ratio of the ingredient is perfect, rich but not oily
The extra avocado is must-have"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were fantastic. Ingredient quality like in California, and no extra sauces/ingredients messing with the taste of the perfectly-cooked fish. (Tried the haddock and the wild salmon.) More expensive than I'd do for lunch every day, but more than reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Healthy & Delicious!
Wild Salmon on Rice - Salmon was fresh and tasty; Red Rice good - needed the sauce on the side and hot sauce (combined, was delicious); a few pieces of tomatoes, cucumber and 4 olives and extra for avocado $15.00 lunch and worth it!~  Will def have this again and again!

Next time I will be trying the Clam Chowder - looked very good!  Also plan on trying to the fish tacos as they looked good too (at the table next to us)."}
{"text":"I've been loving the Fish Store for years now, but also possibly subconsciously forgetting to Yelp about it (online anyway, I've taken at least a half a dozen friends here in person) because they have very limited seating. In warmer weather, sitting outside on the benches or taking out to go al fresco are lovely options. 

In the winter though, when the (arguably) two two-tops that are available inside the wedge of a store are taken, your only option is to stand in the doorway and withhold your salivations while waiting for take away. Luckily, since they only take cash, you'll most likely have to take a jaunt over to a nearby bank which will kill some time.

My all-time favourite default order is the big juicy scallop sandwich, but every time I stare up at the laminated photos, I swear to myself that I'll try a shrimp or fish burrito next time. The potatoey clam chowder is nothing to write home about, but does the job to warm you up. 

It's really nice to have a selection of fresh fish to look at when making your decision. Take advantage of this (or just order the scallop sandwich every time and never have anything to regret)."}
{"text":"I've biked and walked by this place so many times before finally deciding to check it out. I wish I'd tried it sooner. I got the wild salmon sandwich and it was delicious and juicy. There was a good portion of fish and the bread was soft and held up nicely against the sauces. I do wish the sandwich was larger or maybe I was just really hungry. I just ate one and I already want another.

It's also easily accessible as it's right on College. I'll definitely be going back for seconds."}
{"text":"Guys,

Don't leave Toronto without stopping here.

I was walking down College St. when I stumbled onto this gem. Seeing all the fresh fish laid out on a blanket of ice, I eagerly placed my order for the 'fish special' sandwich (grouper). As I pulled out my credit card I noticed the cash only sign. My heart sunk. It was my second to last day in Toronto and I hadn't withdrawn any more cash.

I moved into the next restaurant that evening. The next day I still had the Fish Store on my mind. I ran a few errands and then immediately went to the bank to withdraw cash. Upon arriving at the Fish Store I ordered the rainbow trout sandwich. The special was tilapia so it appears they change the fish daily. I'm my mind I imagine the couple working the store fishing in the mornings to sell their catches throughout the day. 

Anyhow back to the trout sandwich. It came on a buttery roll with tomatoes cucumbers and a lemony sauce. Healthy, fresh and a nice price ($11) for a seafood sandwich.

Seating is limited to an outside patio that is covered for those rainy days. The inside is where the magic happens."}
{"text":"Order: Wild Salmon Sandwich

Atmosphere: The size of a king bed.

Verdict: I swear, am I the only one who had her fish to be dry...? And, the flavours didn't work that well for me either. Also, the bread was too thick. I ordered it with a side of avocodo, expecting it to be in the sandwich itself, but instead they serve it in a styrofoam container on the side. I was not pleased. Maybe my expectations were too high, but definately nothing to rave about for me. On the plus side, it's a good place for a healthy sandwich."}
{"text":"Yelp steered me here tonight, after reading all the absolutely fab reviews I thought I was in for a real treat.

I tried the grouper burrito (about 5oz of grilled grouper put into a whole wheat wrap with some lettuce, tomato and lemon seasoning) for $6.50 plus tax. My friend had the $3.99 grouper burger (about 3oz of grouper in a hamburger bun with lettuce, tomato)

It was good - but to be honest I'm surprised it wasn't better, based on all the fab reviews here. 

Yes, it's fairly cheap, but the serving size wasn't big enough to fully satisfy me.

Now that it's summer, they have a patio which seats around 10-12 people. Inside is tiny, not much room to linger there."}
{"text":"3.8

OK fish is fresh and looks really good, but portions remains quite small... lots of rice, salad etc... but not so much fish compared to regular fish food trucks.

May likely go back when around, but will have to order more extras to leave feeling full."}
{"text":"I'm giving The Fish Store & Sandwiches 5 star because they are superb at what they do, and their fishes are super fresh and tasty!

This place is really small and all they have is pretty much patio seating, but the food is so good I don't mind the limited seats."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh, wholesome. What more could you ask for? The sandwiches are amazing and made to order. Service is quick, you pick your piece and the lady makes it for you. The place is a touch small and you need to bring cash but you won't regret."}
{"text":"I love this place! It may not look like much on the outside but this little blue store serves some pretty tasty stuff! 

First, get inside and take a look at the fish they have to offer that day. There will be a special of the day but you can order any of the fish laid out on display. Each fish comes with a different price tag. Make your selection.
Next, decide how you would like to eat this fish you just picked out. In a sandwich? Burrito style? As a salad? Fish tacos? Or as a meal (meal comes served with brown rice and a few vegetables). 
Place your order and wait for the magic to happen. You really can't go wrong with any of the options,  it's all preference but either way the fish is always grilled to perfection with just the right amount of flavour. Avocado is extra charge but it's so worth it. 

By far one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto. Tasty, fresh, and healthy meal without a heavy price tag. Located in the heart of little Italy. Always worth a visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the red snapper sandwich and I was a big fan. Simple sandwiches but the fish was seasoned nicely. It came on a white bun, with red onion, tomato and lettuce. I also really liked the fish because it's grilled not breaded and I think you can taste the fish more when it's not covered in batter. They also put a generous portion of fish on the sandwich so I was glad I didn't order any sides. They have 15 different types of fish everyday so I will definitely go back to try some others. They have plate options too if you don't want a sandwich. Only 2 tables inside so it's better as a take away place. And it's cash only. Every sandwich is between $9-$11 so it's a great deal. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it would have been nice with a spicy mayo sauce or something like that."}
{"text":"The fish store is a turquoise haven of quick and affordable lunch in an otherwise difficult culinary neighbourhood (I don't like pasta very much). It has a small patio, gives a free piece of gum (\"one is all it takes\"), and makes fantastic little sandwiches of fried grouper, cheese and lettuce for a pocket change price. I've had a surprising amount of people take me for lunch here, which makes me wonder if there's something 'cute' about a girl eating a tiny burger. As I write that, I know it is true."}
{"text":"Seriously no better place to eat in Toronto than one of their wild salmon sandwiches washed down with a housemade limeade.

Rich, succulent, meaty, and tender strips of vibrant sunset-colored salmon nestled between verdant romaine leaves and slices of ruby red tomato wrapped by an amazing Portuguese bun. The rich meat of the salmon flavored by some fragrant spices and sea salt is perfectly complemented by a sweet and tart limeade."}
{"text":"Honestly I've always loved this place, I always get the plate with rice and vegetables. Their house made salad dressing it the best, it's a miso dressing. It's a healthy and filling meal. I've always wanted to try the sandwich but haven't because of their pricing system where it's the same price to get either a plate, or a salad, or a sandwich. The plate is obviously better value, whereas the sandwich seems overpriced at over ten bucks...you can get the 5 dollar special sandwich but it's tiny apparently. Also, their prices in general have gone slightly up and they now charge extra for avocado whereas it used to be just a part of the meal and really brought the value up in my eyes. And...this isn't my personal story but my boyfriend told me the last time he went there he ordered a sandwich and the lady asked if he wanted to add avocado, he said yes, but there was already avocado on the sandwich then she also added an unnecessary half avocado on the side, and the avocado costs like $2.50... That's the price of buying an avocado at most markets... So obviously my issue is with the pricing. The people who own it are really nice, they are a family. I've had a couple different people say that on single occasions they've gone in and the people were kind of rude, but I usually tell people to cram it when they say that because they're allowed to have different moods. They've always been really nice in my experience. I think they have a good thing going, there's no other place like them in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love Fish! I love Grilled Fish! 

I love Grouper and I was lucky enough to come to The Fish Store for a late lunch when they have Grouper as the Catch of the Day! Sweet! 

Grilled Grouper Sandwich ($7.30) tasted so good... so refreshing.... so healthy tasting.........munching munching munching....... 

Homemade Lemonade ($2.65) can be a tad too sweet, but you can always order it half sweetened.... BTW, I love freshly squeezed lemonade too! 
 
I love the small business homey vibe! This place makes me feel like I am in a food stand at a fishing village eating the catch of the day! PS it is a sin to deep fried fresh fish!!

On my lucky day, the weather is nice and sunny... I can enjoy my sandwich on the patio.... i would not have come on a rainy day.. where am I going to eat my sandwich?? 

I am feeling all the love! I will be back for more on another nice sunny day!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goshhhhhhhhhhh I'm so thankful that I live within walking distance of this gem. This place is tiny but it's just the way I like it. It was warm enough when we went that we got to sit outside on that patio. 

I got the special which was grouper in a sandwich and oh my goodness it was amazing. Especially the bread they used. It was the perfect amount of chewiness on the outside, and fluffy and airy on the inside. The lettuce and tomatoes tasted really fresh and had a great mix of herbs that enhanced the flavour of the groupa. The groupa itself was cooked to perfection, grilled but not burnt and not overpowered with spices and herbs but enough to retain the fish flavour. 

DEFINITELY come here and get a fish sandwich. You HAVE to try it!"}
{"text":"My haddock sandwich was ALRIGHT. It was pretty salty, even with the avocodo"}
{"text":"This chub-sized sando-hole makes some slammin' fish sammiches, I tell you what. There is barely enough room in here for a Mediterranean tuna (four seats), so pray to Poseidon that the weather is fair and that you can sit outside on their lovely patio, and soak in the charm of Little Italy.

They have a daily special which includes a soup of the day. I didn't mess around with that and opted instead for a halibut sandwich. Apparently you can add avocado to your 'wich, but inexplicably they serve it on the side. Weird. I didn't mess around with this either.

The sandwich --which came out in about 15 seconds-- was incredible. Served on a super soft Portuguese bun, the fish was moist, perfectly seasoned and filling. It was about nine boners which is a lot for fish on a bun, but it was just that good. I will return and destroy more fish sandwiches with my face.

Obligatory Title Pun: This shop tips the SCALES in your favour.

Menu Readability: I'm honestly sick of writing \"chalkboard\" over and over. Come on Toronto.

Need to mention: Cash only.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm not really a fish sandwich kind of guy. But who is?"}
{"text":"Tucked away into a tiny sliver of a shop that has only enough room for an ice counter with fresh fish, a small grill and some shelves the shop faces out to College Street. The place ingeniously uses a really small space in an efficient way. There is a small patio that provides seating outside and one or two tables on the inside. The fare is simple and straight-forward and exactly what one wants in a fish place."}
{"text":"i came here due to the excellent reviews ...

to be honest it was quite disappointing because my expectations were really high..

first off, i thought fish would be grilled .. but turns out its panfried on a everyday electric stove.. and if you think you can make this at home.. you are absolutely right.. because thats exactly what it tastes like... i went home and made the same salad and fish the next day with balsamic vinegrette... 

guess what.. tasted exact same if not better... 

its simply home food... its owned by 2 local koreans and they panfry fish for you.. simple as that.. its not restaurant quality... its litterally what u would get if you made all these dishes at home.. to be honest a lil bland for me.   

prices arent exactly home food prices ...so thats why they lose a star.. but nice owners and good service.."}
{"text":"As with many Yelpers here, I came largely to see Kat eat some fish, with a side benefit of having some fish myself.

The place was tiny. Uber is a word that feels a bit played out now, but this definitely qualifies as ubertiny. Also triangular, which was weird. 

There's a great selection of fish here - I went for the salmon - and a variety of ways to have it prepared / served. My sandwich was served up on an incredible bun, spiced and with veggies. Delicious.

In terms of meal accoutrements, there's a varety of sodas and juices, as well as sauces for sandwiches. Included here are my favourite hot chili sauce, and Coke in glass bottles that tasted like proper sugared coke, not that HFCS crap.

In eBay parlance: GREAT SELLER A++++ WOULD BUY AGAIN"}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood getting a massage and the therapist recommended this place.

The place sure doesn't look like much but that's OK. It's like a tiny lunch counter with some basic outdoor seating. (Where do customers sit in the winter??)

I ordered the fish tacos - basically four soft tacos stuffed with tomatoes and I think baby spinach, and topped with a slice of halibut. Two of the tacos were white flour tortillas and 2 were whole wheat. It was $13.75 + $1.50 for guacamole.

Good
- the fish is grilled so it's healthier than the fried stuff I get at The Battered Fish
- whole wheat tortillas available

Bad 
- the pieces of halibut were small. It was more like a little fish finger in each taco. I shoulda taken a picture! Lol
- nothing special taste-wise. (The halibut fish & chips at The Battered Fish with their signature sauce is way tastier.)

The guy at the table next to me ordered the daily special which was a grilled red snapper sandwich for $9.75. It looked better than my tacos did. I'll be getting that next time!"}
{"text":"My family was visiting Toronto and found this great seafood restaurant in the Little Italy area.   They have only a handful of tables and make all the food fresh just steps away.  Everything was outstanding - delicious and fresh!  Had the fish tacos, fish on salads, and their soup - all excellent!"}
{"text":"Shrimp burrito with avocado. Salmon salad with avocado. Salad-salmon  has some bones, small to  medium size.  Salmon seems a bit dry and might not be so fresh. Salad without fish is tasty. Salmon might not be the best choice for salad. Overall both dishes 7.5 out of 10

Shrimp burger was simple, tasty but not a shocker. 5/10

Tacos with grouper fish was average. If you up for some tacos, look somewhere else. They are big, but again not a shocker. 4/10"}
{"text":"Great little place on college st that's a bit difficult to find at night if you don't know the address as their sign is not lit.  Wanted to try the sandwiches everyone raves about but they were sold out of bread on this night so we went for the grouper burrito and salmon salad instead along with a potato based clam chowder.  Ordered 2 sides of avocado but only received but it was too late as we did not check til we got home.  The burrito was good but I had my mind set on a sandwich so I was a little disappointed.  Salad was really good, veggies were all fresh and the salmon cooked perfectly.  The soup was a bit of a let down though.  I've never had a potato based clam chowder so I don't have a basis for comparison though its safe to say I would not order it again.  Will be back for a sandwich though!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious fish sandwiches with healthy toppings.  Fish tacos are also fantastic.  Good spot for a quick lunch in the summer on their little patio fronting onto College.  And yes, their lemonade is awesome."}
{"text":"Food ****
Service ***
Ambiance **** (in summer)

Outdoor seafood takeout style spot.   Great fish selection lightly seasoned and cooked just right.  

Tried the halibut, salmon and grouper.  All great and well worth the $11 it costs.  

Definitely recommended during the summer or better weather for a patio meal or takeout."}
