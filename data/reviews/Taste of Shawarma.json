{"text":"Was not what I expected at all. Good portions and lots of chicken but it was like having a wet pita wrap. If I ever go back I know what to ask for to make it better. Ask them to go easy on the sauce. But if you're looking for a filling chicken wrap and not a shwarma you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is good, cheap (price-wise), and has fantastic hours.   Seriously, it is one of the best places in the city to grab some great food late in the night. The Shawarma Sandwiches are amazing, and the Shawarma Fries, while simple, are a fantastic treat."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma dinner with white rice and salad. You also have the option of brown rice or French fries. My friend had the chicken shawarma dinner with French fries and they were hot and crispy right out of the fryer.  The chicken was tasty, moist and crispy.  It was a lot of food at a decent price."}
{"text":"One of the worst shawarmas I've had in a while. Not sure if I was just out of luck but the meat was completely overcooked... Really dry and almost to the point where it was burnt. Place only takes cash and doesn't have its own parking which is a bummer"}
{"text":"This is very close to us, so we go often. Overall we've had great experiences here. It seems like it's changed hands a few time over the years (different staff all of a sudden), but they are always reliable. We usually get chicken plates with brown (or \"dirty\") rice which is just white rice with mild spices in it. Everything is fresh and tasty. A few times we've had dry chicken that was sitting on the grill a bit too long, but if you ask, they cut fresh for you off the spit without a hassle. Normally the chicken is juicy, flavorful with great crispy edges.  They are very generous with portions and sauces. We like this ; ). I'm a lover of Toum (garlic sauce) so always ask for lots, and always say I'm happy to pay extra, but they pile it on and say no charge with a smile. The sandwiches are equally good, and the fries covered in toum and feta (not on menu, just ask) are craaaazy good. Drink selection is limited, and they don't have a many toppings as other shops, but we don't care. 20 bucks gets us 2 huge dinners we can never finish. And they are on Uber Eats for delivery if you're feeling lazy."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and has been my go to late night shawarma place.  Great portions and service.  The chick is amazing always juicy and crunchy at the same time.  Only downside is they only take cash, but luckily there is an ATM inside.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Chicken Fries wow. Okay get the Chicken fries salad and all the toppings. But don't get addicted cause theres a lot of calories in there. Its really good here. Our bicycle store RB Inc is around the corner and we eat there often."}
{"text":"After being introduced here by my boyfriend, I've been obsessed. We always get the chicken and fries special and it never disappoints.  Don't be fooled by how the exterior or the store looks like, it's a hidden gem in this area!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm Chicken Shawarma! I ran into this place randomly after searching poynt. For around $6 I was stuffed! It was sliced right off and fried a little longer. Delicious :) It wasn't dry at all. I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch.  A really great experience with the. Hockey shawarma.  It was juicy and not dry!  I recommend it for the shawarmites out there!  Decor average!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After living years in the Middle East I always know what a good shawarma is and decided to try this place out after the decent overall review rank. Shawarma was big with lots of chicken and sauces - however too much making it soggy. Yet, Ive never seen chicken being reheated on a grill and put In the sandwich as opposed to cut straight off as every place does! Cash only plus tax is an interesting concept as per the comment by a reviewer I saw now. The shawarma wasn't bad but for $8 I'm not sure what people are on about it being reasonable. I've had amazing shawarmas elsewhere in the city for around $5 so this is def overpriced for fast food; that too of this quality and being in the area it is! Clearly the people who go here don't know real shawarmas!"}
{"text":"The food is fine but the problem is they often don't have like 70% of the items on the menu. They should just change the menu if they don't offer the items that they purport to offer and instead have a blackboard or something which they change every day to reflect whatever they have. But the items they do have are quite nice. The chicken fries is one of my favorite items. But it seems to me that they prepare the gyros the day before and leave it in a cool place for the night. I am always reluctant to go early in the morning because the exterior meat may see some bacterial growth when left out in the open for ~12 hours."}
{"text":"Yum! Try the Shwarma fries. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, and great prices. The chicken shawarma was good. I really enjoyed the hummus, the best compared to other shawarma restaurants in my area. The tabouleh is definitely fresh, full of parsley and not dripping in dressing or oil like other places."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken, affordable, and closes late...  Some of my friends who had lived here long time, and that enjoy night life, recommended me this place.  When it is late, you have the \"munchies\" for something salty, tasty and even spciy ( that can also help you with next day hangover). This is one of the places you won't regret visiting...  We went there on Saturday at 1:30 am. It had like 10 people eating there, and they all looked satisfied with what they were having. The smell was inviting; the place was clean (too much light for my preferences at that time); and the two guys attending were polite, quick and efficient.   We asked for two chicken Shawarmas to go, and in five minutes we were paying. It was less than 20 dls, for all that amount of food.  When we started eating back home, I couldn't finished my chicken, even when I wanted to, but awesome, cuz I had lunch for next day!!!  Definitely going back.  And yes, the chicken fries are a hit for crowds of nocturne party animals..."}
{"text":"Went a few times, I noticed the owner has been gone all the previous time I did go back thus the low rating. There was an employee who worked there for 6 months when I went in, this employee who I shall not name really screwed up the sandwich, the bread tore up when they were rolling the sandwich.   The chicken was over grilled and dry (a few times, since I've been back) with the owner missing this place is running low that I now don't go back. Bad credit on making the chicken dry"}
{"text":"We love this place and eat here at least once per week.  The chicken is always perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the in.  Shawarma wraps are sometimes messy but well worth the effort.  Or get the chicken shawarma platter and you can eat all the goodies with a fork, without messing your hands!  Stuffed vine leaves aren't the best I've ever had but pretty scrummy with a side of shawarma sauce.  Baklava is good.  Falafel isn't the best, and they only take cash, thus the 4 stars, but we come here for the chicken, not the vegetarian stuff and we don't mind paying in cash just be prepared before you come.  Also chicken & fries is good, and they will put a salad on top so it's like a platter with fries instead of rice.  There is an ATM inside the place, also a Scotiabank next door.  Happy place = chicken shawarma wrap with garlic sauce, lettuce, seasoned onions, turnips, pickles, hot peppers, shawarma sauce and hot sauce.  Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Cute little place situated on a corner.  Decor could be a little updated.  Staff is friendly and courteous.  The falaffel wrap I ordered was delish, bit it was a tad bit over cooked.  Just a little.  Baklava to die for."}
{"text":"It was ok. My lettuce was bad and there wasn't enough meat in the sandwich. It's ok cause it wasn't that great. Half way through there I found a hair in the sandwich. Which was surprising cause the restaurant seemed pretty clean. Maybe they should be wearing hair nets."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to shawarma joint. Chicken and fries are a crowd favourite. I order the large for $9 flat, though a dinner plate (half salad, half chicken over rice or fries) is only a dollar more (tax included). For those of you wondering the difference between the white rice and the brown rice: white rice has a bit more butter/veggie flavouring, while the brown rice is more spiced and tends to leave a cinnamonny aftertaste. Regardless of what you order, the guys behind the counter will niiiiice you. 11/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Uses very thin and soft pita. Meat is very juicy and cured very well and has tons of flavour. Absolutely delicious. This is more of a take out place, I wouldn't stay here to eat.   Updated...came here just last week. The wait time was 25 minutes for a shawarma. Don't know what was going on. Even AFTER 25 minutes they were not ready, just left. It doesn't take that long to serve shawarma but if there were any issues they should have informed me. I left the store waiting 25 minutes later empty handed."}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma place in Toronto. You must try their chicken shawarma with the shawarma sauce. Also they have chicken on fries special, it is so delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious Shawarma! Definitely the authentic thing! The shawarma had a good portion of meat and a good mixture of vegetables. Good selection of drinks with both North American and Middle Eastern (well Canadian Middle Eastern) options.   My only criticism of this place is that the price point is slightly higher than some of the other Shawarma places I've been to. Total came to $10. But considering they are open late and the closest thing I've found to authentic shawarma outside of Scarborough.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good. (I really liked the Shawarma Fries.) The customer service was decent. The prices were reasonable. The place was ugly -- yet I would return."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I am visiting from Atlanta Georgia and love it when I can find good shawarma wraps. This place did it for me. They do not accept credit cards and their ATM is not for international use, however there is a bank in the same parking lot you can use."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of my friend. He kept talking about these shawarma fries. All the time I would hear about these mystical shawarma fries.  After a game of trampoline dodgeball, \"let's get shawarma fries\"; after playing a game of risk, \"let's get shawarma fries\"; after going to an escape room; \"lets get shawarma fries\"; after any long night out, \"let's get shawarma fries\".  It became so sensationalized by him that I thought to myself, \"I gotta try this, but no way is it going to live up to my expectations.\" I was right... About needing to try it. I was dead wrong about it not living up to the hype. It was absolutely incredible. The combination of flavours worked so well. It was the best part about fries and the best part about shawarma, coming together to create a fantastic medley of tastes and textures.  You need to try it. Now."}
{"text":"Good food but the people working there can be a little more accommodating. I was there many times where one lady got the order wrong for multiple people and the man on cash blamed it on the customers. I didn't find that right at all....The food keeps me coming back so overall I would reccomend it."}
{"text":"Fulfilling portions, great crispy taste and good price. Good customer service. Might get busy at times but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Literally- THE BEST shawarma in the city!! So so soooo in love - I recommend it to everyone and will most likely never stop recommending it. I also can barely eat shawarma anywhere else because this place is just sooo tasty and amazing!!"}
{"text":"STAFF: I don't recall friendlier staff at any other restaurant. The woman and the girl working there make you feel welcome with their smiles and positive attitude. I cannot say enough good things about how friendly the service is at this place.  FOOD: Here's why I'm giving this place a 2/5 rating. I had a chicken shawarma plate with fries, salad and white sauce on top. The fries were ok, but either the chicken or the sauce had a strong smell and taste of vinegar. I was hungry and had to eat against my will, because there was no other decent place open that evening. I'm not stating anything definitively, but typically, restaurants use this trick of using vinegar to mask the real taste of food that has gone bad, but needs to be utilized to meet profitability goals. It is possible that their chicken had gone bad that day, so they used vinegar to mask the true flavour. I will never know, because I'm not going back to that place again.  Bottom line: Next time, I'm going to my tried and true favourite place - Babos Donerpoint at 2216 Eglinton Ave West."}
{"text":"I really, really hate to do this but I need to go back on my initial review and give this place a 1 star due to my most recent experience.  I have been to this place many times and as I mentioned in my previous review (this place is a hit and miss but more hits than misses) - not this time around.  Here are the 3 MAJOR issues I had with my recent visit:  1. The server was rightfully so using gloves to handle our food but when I went to the washroom (i'll chat about that experience in point number 2) I noticed that he ran to the door and was  fixing the door or doing something with it to get it close because someone didn't close it properly and it kept beeping. Anyways when I came back I noticed he started wrapping my shawarma and I asked my boyfriend- did he change his gloves? He's like no why (my boyfriend was getting money from the ATM because it is cash only there so he didn't notice the guy left to go fix this door or whatever). I then told him what he did and we were completely turned off. He was literally feeling up the door and handle and it was just plain gross...and that point I should have been like, ciao bello....eat the shawarma yourself.  2. Upon walking to the washroom you walk past their backroom/kitchen area. As I walked by I looked as the door was wide open and I noticed not 1 not 2 but 6 bags of chicken sitting in a HOT ass room on top of cardboard boxes. The bags were not cut open and just sitting in blood in a hot room without any acknowledgement from the staff. They also had it right beside the trays they were using to cut the fresh vegetables which just looks unsanitary! A BIG NO NO!! which leads to me to believe all these factors resulted in point # 3.  3. My boyfriend was so ill after we ate there- I couldn't get the poor guy home FAST enough. Without going into too much details, let's just say, it was a very unpleasant evening for him.  I gave this place way too many chances before in the past but they will NOT get my business anymore. Store your food properly, practice proper hygiene, get with the 21st century and get a damn POS system already and figure out why everyone is always getting sick after they eat your shit."}
{"text":"I am shocked to see such great reviews for this place. I tried and was disappointed. I believe if actual middle easterners ate here, this place would be shut down by now. They did not impress me at all, and I am not middle eastern, but know what good food is. Quantity of chicken was not enough, they didn't even have the right consistency in their sauces, they didn't even know how to wrap up the bread properly. To top it off; the place is cash only. They charge tax but their receipt didn't display their HST number on it. Seems like they are collecting sales tax but not reporting it to the government. I will not eat there again."}
