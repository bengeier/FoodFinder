{"text":"Not a bad place for steak and fries, though I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way.  The all-you-can-eat fries and BYOB are the main selling points here.  Entrees and non-beef items are overpriced.

Funny anecdote: Was at a friend's dinner party.  We told the waiter it's his birthday (it was), so he asked my friend if he wanted profiteroles.  He said okay (we brought a bottle of red wine for each person, so he was kind of tipsy).  15 minutes later the waiter shows up with profiteroles, and good time was had by all.  Until my friend looked at the bill, and discovered that he just paid for his own b-day dessert!  HAHA"}
{"text":"This place wasn't so bad...another decent restaurant to stop in while touring about the old port.  Our service was friendly and the endless fries were a hit with everyone.  It's BYOB so fair warning, bring in your own booze.  It's not a home run as other reviewers indicate, but another spot for tourists that places it safe."}
{"text":"This menu will have you holding on to your wallet for its dear life. But if you want Suburban Fancy, you've got the best tasting food right by your local Elementary school. 

Sure, there are no courses under $17 Canadian dollars, but doesn't that mean you immediately assume that the food will be da bomb? Well, the food was DA BOMB. Let me tell you. I ordered the Japonais, $20,00. My mother ordered the salmon and my father ordered the steak et frites. One thing you might forget about being in French Quebec is the fact that all of the bread you will ever get your hands on in these however many square miles will be the best tasting bread, ever. I exaggerate. But that tender, soft, warm and fluffy feeling of fresh bread in a basket feels almost like--like--it's way too inappropriate for a restaurant review, i'm sorry.

The restaurant itself actually looks like a diner. For rich people. Except the waitresses aren't wrinkly, white or widowed. They're either Asian or good-looking young fellows. There are giant pieces of white paper on the table that acts as a cloth, so feel free to draw on them. Because I did. 

When my Japonais arrived, I told the director to 'CUT!' I looked at this magnificent plate and jumped back and pointed at the beautifully ripe purple orchid sitting on my platter. When was the last time there was an orchid on my plate?! I was almost convinced it was edible. Each bite of the sushi, fresh sushi, the mystery rolls that were crunchy and slightly spicy and looked like they were sculpted by the Gods, I just couldn't handle myself. All of it was good. Down to the salad in a giant wine glass. Down to the shredded carrot that I stuffed inside that wine glass to get the rest of the dressing. Down to the last crumb, to the real seaweed in the soup, to the mushrooms in that miso soup that I did not know could exist in Miso soup.

Merci pour le Japonais, Lord."}
{"text":"The bottomless fries are a great idea, but the fact of the matter is that they're a little overcooked and quite bland, so not really worth your while. Food's overpriced (but you knew that already), but really quite good. Their steak (I had the 9 oz. cooked medium) was delicious. Ultimately it was alright, but way overrated and way overpriced."}
{"text":"Good food but not great food. A tad over-priced for what you're getting in my opinion. Decent quality steak, OK salad and dry veggies. Fries and dessert are fantastic, I must say. The restaurant itself is a little too dark (be sure to have your flash on if you're taking a picture) but does have an intimate feel to it.

That being said -HORRIBLE SERVICE! The other commenters are right about that one. Waiter was rude and hostess made it pretty obvious she didn't want to be there in the way she treated us. Food took too long to arrive and we were rushed out of the restaurant. The meal itself wasn't enjoyable with the waiters hovering over us, making it CLEAR how impatient they were."}
{"text":"Ce resto est de moins en moins bon.

Nous étions un groupe de 15, personne n'a mangé un steak à la cuisson demandé. 

Nous avions quelques questions sur le menu et la serveuse revenait toujours sans réponse.  Elle dit qu'ils n'ont pas d'infos parce qu'ils commendent du bureau chef.  Ordinaire!"}
{"text":"das Essen ist total lecker, der Koch weiss wie man Fleisch zart und auf den Punkt zubereitet. etwas teurer aber nicht zu angehoben. schenkt keinen Alkohol aus, also Wein oder Bier mitbringen."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant quand on a envie de viande. J'ai toujours bien aimé leur steak et, avec une montagne de frites et une sauce succulente, on peut difficilement se tromper quand on cherche à combler le carnivore en nous. Le confit de canard et le saumon sont également excellents, de même que les calmars en entrée. L'ambiance est très bien et le service est bon. Un choix intéressant en soirée."}
{"text":"We arrived on time and were seated in the upper floor. The service was well paced, the menu a little difficult to read fro our seats but otherwise fine. Where were we let down... a steak that was ordered rare was medium rare at one and and well-done (ie leather) at the other end. The irony was that we also ordered a vegetable brochette which was almost raw and uncooked. When your name has the word Steak in it, you better know how to cook a steak perfectly.....

While I'm not deducting points for this, I have to point out that the server (under orders from management) removed a plate while others were still eating. I know that this is normal practice in the US, but many people (including myself) think that this is rude and we should at least be asked if it's acceptable. It makes a guest feel like they are eating too slowly and the other(s) to sit uncomfortably as if they are rushing the other(s). It's a horrible standard and makes people at the table uncomfortable. Save us from this rudeness by simply either asking if you may remove the plate or waiting until all have finished."}
{"text":"Rude service at 8:45 pm on a Wednesday.   Our group of 5 arrived at Steak frites at 8:45 pm for dinner. We were told that the kitchen was about to close and so we would need to order quickly.  We did just that, but when I ordered an appetizer as my entree, I received a scolding about this.  No one took our drink order either,  We watched a large group arrive, get seated, and then leave without ordering as they were treated equally as rude.   Good fries, but a truly rude host."}
{"text":"We were seated upstairs and the server provided our menus. The server was helpful in providing explanation about the menu but was all downhill from there.

After ordering, I noticed a couple of elderly ladies that were seated next to us and to my other side another group. The elderly ladies came in and order 10 mins after we gave our order to the server. The other group came almost the same time as the elderly lady but left because they thought the server was taking too long to come back after they asked for another minute (it was another 5-10 mins after and still no one arrived). This was a sign of things to come

The elderly ladies received their food before us. I couldn't believe it. There were only 3 of us vs 2 which couldn't mean it took that much longer. This whole time we were waiting, the server topped up their water and even provided bread. Nothing for us. I had to ask the server for some bread because the food was taking way too long. 

Finally the food arrived. I was looking at how the elderly ladies were served the fries and I couldn't wait. They were filling up the bowls in front of you AND your plate. I was starving. When our steak arrived it looked like any steak but when the server gave us fries, only the bowls in front of us. Again, I couldn't believe it. I looked around other tables and noticed that ALL of them had their plates filled with fries as well. 

I was done with this place. I didn't even think they deserved any tip. I will never go back and DO NOT RECOMMEND. 

FOOD IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND SERVICE IS HORRIFIC. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Over priced and poor service. Reserved for a large group on a Saturday at 7:30pm.  Our 1 server had to cover our table plus 2 other large groups-maybe around 50 people total, so we were left to fend for ourselves most of the time. She tried her best but was overwhelmed-bad on the management for sticking her with so many clients! We could barely get out by 10:30pm nearly 3 hours later as the kitchen and/or the service couldn't keep up. It took quite an effort to get our bills dropped before the place closed.

The steak and fries were decent but nothing special. Sauces were gelatinous. Everyone who ordered seafood was sorely disappointed-scallops (27$!), salmon and calamari were rubbery and dry.

The guest of honour has food allergies so we brought a special desert and were asked to pay 40$ for cake cutting, instead we ended up eating our cupcakes on the street as we could not get out of there fast enough!

This might be an OK BYOB dinner spot for 2 on a weeknight but don't go with a group!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love this place!

I won't start by raving about the all you can eat fries...but...they have all you can eat fries! mmmmmm

Of all the BYOW places in Montreal that I have been to, this one takes the cake. The atmosphere is awesome, the food is delicious, and the prices are great! 

I've had a few things on their menu but never any seafood (because it's a steak place, duh), and I've never been really disappointed (although their steak isn't the best..). The service has always been great (even on busy nights), and we've always managed to have a good time here whether we've been a group of 2 or 30 (yes, I threw a party here once, and they accommodated us SO well!)

Also, you CANNOT miss out on their mini desserts. They are to die for! Especially the creme brulee....sooooo yummy.

All in all, despite the not-super-amazing steak, I still keep coming back. Check it out - you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Un classique! Pas cher car apportez votre vin. Cest très bon et la déco est belle! Une belle sortie en semaine ou en groupes. Bonnes frites a volonté! Les profitérolles sont dures a ne pas commander!"}
{"text":"The steak there is not amazing for what you pay... I just feel there are better alternatives after being there a fee times."}
{"text":"A nouveau ce soir avec un groupe de 35 personnes pour le fête de Gab, Jean-Marc Reid et son équipe avec Joanie et Catherine nous ont offert un excellent service avec des assiettes à la hauteur de la chaine Steak Frites St-Paul et servie chaude et pas mal rapide...GOOD JOB !
Le steak Frites St-Paul sur St-Denis l'un des meilleurs de Montréal !"}
{"text":"I had the pork. Extremely well coked. Sauce was delicious. Frites were amazing. My family got the steaks and weren't huge fans because it was boring. I loved the pork though. Great service as well. Would come again. BYOB"}
{"text":"Okay, well here's my review of steak frites. The decor is very nice. This is a good-looking restaurant and It shows. The owners of this restaurant gave themselves every opportunity possible to be successful. Beautiful space, location, steak, all you can eat fries, bring your own wine! This should be a home run. But it isn't a home run. 

Here's my problem with this restaurant. The steak! The cuts of meat are extremely poor. Now I've been here more than once, so this isn't an isolated incident. Tonight I ordered a 7 ounce steak, and my steak almost tasted like to liver. And by coincidence, my friend says to me within the first 15 seconds of chewing, \"hey, my steak taste like liver\". 

This restaurant has everything going for itself. But the one problem they just can't seem to get away from is that there cuts of meat are cheap. I really want this restaurant to be good. But I always leave disappointed.

I should probably give it 2 stars. But it could easily be 4."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while at a client site nearby and took their Grilled Sesame Beef.

What I got was I paid for. A few 'slices' of Beef with some sesame seeds and a few side orders. All in all the food was plain and uninspiring.

I'd recommend going for their special signature meals rather than their extended menu. I know I regretted it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great steak, this is not the best place for one however, it is a bring your own wine which makes it a little better. Our server was nice and recommended the calamari and it did not disappoint.  I love the ambiance of this resto, it feels quite romantic and classy. I would bring a date here to show off my excellent wine picking skills and order some good appys. The steak on the other hand needs to be improved."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the sleepy suburb of Boucherville, on the South Shore area. When you step inside the brick and wood structure, it looks like it may have been a former chain casual dining place, serving only Steak Frites. 

However, the new full name is Steak Frites OKI. Not sure what the OKI stands for, but the restaurant has an eclectic menu, including French, and a fusion of Thai and Japanese dishes. 

The restaurant, however, is Vietnamese owned, and the main male waiter is Vietnamese, too, while the other male server is a mixed Cambodian and Vietnamese. They speak French and English impeccably, however, having been in Quebec for 30 years, although originally from Saigon, Vietnam. 

I had the Japonais, which was $22,95 and had a mixture of sushi roll slices, nigiri (salmon and tuna), a deep fried imperial type roll with a thousand island type drizzle, and a red wine glass salad with a tasty miso-sesame dressing. 

The Gateaux Cappuchino coffee cake dessert was nice, cool and not too sweet ($5.95) and the hot coffee was adequate (only $2.25).

The service is quite good here, and so is the food. The place is huge and could seat several dozens of people in the white clothed tables and wood chairs. There is no liquor served, but you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Nice l'entrée (salmon tartare and bong bong shrimp), fair steak and service. Maybe the steak is overpriced"}
{"text":"Great food. Fried Goat Cheese appetizer was outstanding. The French Onion Soup was not salty and the onions were soft and flavorful. The escargots were very tasty. Remember to bring your own wine or walk up the block to the other wine store. Sautéed Mushrooms were some of the best I have ever had. Famous for steak and endless French fries (great tasting) but the real secret of the place is the other items."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to stop.  We had lunch and the entirety of Montreal brought their wine with them to this lovely little place.  Steak Frite fantastic and Duck Confit out of this world."}
