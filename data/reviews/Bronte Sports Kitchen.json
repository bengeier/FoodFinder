{"text":"Very cute 'hole in the wall' type of place. 

Went when it was rather busy (lunch rush) and still received food and service quite quickly. 

Veggie burger was great- prices were good!"}
{"text":"Ordered nachos, wings and fish and chips. 
Nachos should have come out first but we're obviously held back and served with the rest. 
Service was slow. 
They don't offer a Mild sauce so got BBQ. 
Wings were bland and the BBQ sauce had no flavour. 
Quite expensive expensive $63"}
{"text":"Couldn't tell if the place was open, it is so darkly lit outside.. Kind of in a dicey area with a \"love\" shop next door, but the place seemed clean and friendly with a nice st at bar and great waitresses. 
I had the Steak Frites (Steak and fries) with Caesar salad and found it hearty and tasty. I would get it and come back as well."}
{"text":"Came here at 4pm. I realized I was probably the only person under 40 in there, but everyone there seemed to know everyone else, so it definitely gave off a friendly vibe. It's a typical watering hole serving pub/diner food. The place itself is pretty big, so seating wasn't much of a problem (the only problem being that I couldn't decide where to sit!). They have all day breakfast and daily specials (wings/steak/etc) which is always a big plus in my book. 

Anyway, I got steak and 3 eggs, which comes with home fries and toast. It's pretty typical to the other steak & eggs I've had at other places so not too outstanding. But hey you can't really go wrong for $12.99 for all that right?

My waitress was pretty accommodating and friendly. I didn't have to wait long to order or my food to arrive and she checked on me a few times to see if things were ok. 

Probably gonna come back to check out their wings apparently they're a crowd-pleaser?"}
