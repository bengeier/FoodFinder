{"text":"Watch how we roll!  Love this place.  They make a damn good pita and service is with a smile.  Club pita no tomato.  That's my nosh of choice."}

{"text":"One of my favorite places.Exceptional customer service, GREAT fresh food and yummy new desserts. They also have smoothies and buy so many get one free cards. I am addicted!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a healthy and quality option for lunch this is the place for you. This place serves pita and pizzas and has a good variety for everyone. I'm a fan of the Thai Chicken or the Godfather. The Thai Chicken has avocado, cucumbers and peanut sauce and is very refreshing. The staff is very friendly and I've heard great things about the hummus and pizzas. This place is vegetarian friendly as well. I highly recommend stopping in to grab yourself a pita."}
{"text":"How did I miss this gem? I've been driving past Cyclones Pitas daily, for years,and I just tried it for the first time. WOW, I'm sure glad I did! This place is wonderful and I'm already planning what to get next.   I had the Thai Chicken Pita: spicy peanut sauce, chicken, cucumber, avocado, sprouts and lettuce. $6.99! Portion size was just right, not super big, but not small by any means, it was just right.  I really enjoyed everything about my pita from the freshness of EVERYTHING on it to the perfect packaging. Spicy peanut sauce wasn't to spicy, so don't freak and not get it because of the \"spicy\" thing. It really just had a slight, really slight almost a hint of spicy, nothing a little kid couldn't eat. Veggies were as fresh as they get and complimented the chicken and peanut sauce perfectly. I really liked the avocado in this pita, I think it gave it something extra special. Chips and fountain drinks as well as coffee are available. I think I saw some yummy cookies too, but I was too excited about my pita, I forgot to get one :( Maybe next time.  Vegetarian options also available!!!  Customer service was friendly, speedy and overall nice! Not a single complaint. The one thing that caught my eye right away was the cleanliness of Cyclones Pitas. This place is spotless. Not only is the food great, but I can feel good about eating it, knowing I'm not in any danger of some horrible food borne illness. You really have to see inside for yourself, to know what I'm talking about. Outside patio with several tables, can't wait for spring. Oh, last but not least FREE WiFi! Who doesn't love a patio, good food and free wifi?!  Prices are decent, no more then $9 for a pita or pita pizza. I'll pay $9 all day for a pita."}
{"text":"This place is great neighborhood gem. The owners and staff are very friendly. I'm addicted to their Brazen Bull pita sandwich. A definite \"must-try\" for lunch if you live or work in the area. Heck, even if you don't live or work in the area, it's worth the drive. They have a wide variety of sandwiches (chicken, turkey, roast beef and vegetarian varieties) that are made-to-order. They also cater from what I understand. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm always eager to find new places to get healthier lunches that hits the happy medium between \"fast food mystery meat\" and \"time consuming pricier sit-down full service\" restaurants. I found Cyclones Pitas today and am glad I gave them a try. A locally owned business that focuses on pita wrap sandwiches with a large selection of ingredients (vegetarian, turkey, beef, chicken, etc.). The company logo and name comes from the spiral of the cut pita sandwich... clever... Besides pita wraps, they also offer pita pizzas that look crispy and yummy. Cyclones offers a daily \"special\" that consists of a varying pita sandwich type, a bag of chips, and a fountain drink for $7.  They advertise their special of the day on facebook, providing daily temptation.  Today, the special was the Happy Hummus and Turkey pita, which I thought was very tasty. The restaurant is very well kept, nicely decorated, offers wi-fi, and the quick service is provided with an eager smile. From their website, they are willing to host small meetings at their facility and they also do catering as well. Thumbs up!  I'm going to have to go back to try some of their other offerings.  Next time, I'll bring a crowd with me.  :)"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Lots of pitas as implied by its name. Nicely flavored, I had the California Club. They told me it was there most popular and it delivered. Great atmosphere (deli feel), clean (very clean bathrooms), nice classic rock music playing.  Will come again if I come out this way in the future.  I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I work right by there, so it is a nice, close lunch. The staff is great. The food is really good.   I absolutely love the chicken pesto pizza! It's on the flat bread. Super crunchy and so tasty. Mmm.  The Cali Turkey Wrap is also good. Fresh avacado, crispy lettuce and a great sauce.  Oh and the BLT. How can you go wrong???   Cyclone Pita also has a daily special. It comes with a drink and chips for a good price. Also, they have a soup and half a sandwich combo. More than enough food -and a great price. It's a Perfect stop for lunch."}
{"text":"2 out 5 on the level of authenticity. Why they call themselves Mediterranean, I'll never know. They literally put cheap lunch meat, pour a lot of mayo on it, wrap it and feed this to you under disguise of gourmet (which it's not). Moments into digesting this, you are starting to sound a lot like the case study: \" Overweight Caucasian female had lunch at KFC and returned to your office with severe right upper quadrant pain...\". Your gallbladder does have limitations; and if you could still gotten  away with eating Oscar mayer's bologna-wonder-bread-kraft-mayo sandwiches, it would have let you know.  Or you wouldn't have known that you do indeed have a gallbladder and it literally starts hurting when you just drive by that place. I don't know about you, but I want to die of a different poison. In the world, where people voluntarily chew on kale and lift things heavier than bridges to stay fit, only an enemy will feed you mayo, bread and sodium-rich lunch meats."}
{"text":"WANTED: - Healthy options - Wifi - Affordable food - Quick  RECEIVED: - Healthy options - Free wifi - Super affordable - Friendly/helpful staff   I was in Cleveland for work and on my way back to Columbus needed a spot to veer off and knock a few things off my work list before I hit the road. I was also starving.  Yelp app to the rescue! Found Cyclones and it seemed to have all I was looking for (see above.) With more than two dozen pita sammich combos from turkey & avocado (their most popular is the California Club) to pizza pitas that smelled amazing, there didn't seem to be a bad choice on the menu. Any pita could be made into a salad, which is what I opted for, and the daily combo meal specials that come with a drink and soup are a steal.  I got a cup of the tomato bisque, which was OK, but all kinds of oily. It left a film on the roof of my mouth.  I think I went wrong by ordering the salad option because after all of it was devoured, I really just wanted a pita. Lesson learned!  They serve local coffee, too,  that wasn't bitter and even was still hot at 2pm!   As a quick lunch option in Fairview Park, and especially if you need wifi, give these local guys a try! A hundred times better than Subway or Jimmy Johns for sure."}
{"text":"This place is worth seeking out! Unfortunately, it's easy to miss as you drive by. Great healthy choices, but I do wish they had a wheat pita option."}
{"text":"Cyclones was fantastic. Just had their California turkey pita and tomato basil soup combo. Only 8 bucks and I'm full and satisfied. Loved it! Can't wait to see what else they have. Valpak is also carrying a 50% off 1 pita pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has become my weekday lunch spot 2 to 3 times a week. Thanks so much YELP for finding me a gem of a local spot.  Decor is nice and modern and the place is freaking spotless!   The staff is warm and welcoming and attentive to your needs.  7 to 10$ for a pita, drink and a bag of chips pretty inexpensive for what you get.  Ingredients are fresh and have not had a bad pita yet. Even the \"pizzas\" are delicious.   For 1st timers this place can be hard to find as it is buried in an office center.   Check out this local gem!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  We stopped in for lunch on our first visit there, and were impressed by the quality and taste of the wraps and soups.  Their wrap selection is truly excellent, with a great variety of cheeses, meats, and veggies.  Parking out back is ample, and the staff very friendly.  The only constructive criticism I could give them is that they need to serve 'sides' (perhaps tuna salad, macaroni salad, cole slaw, etc.) to complement a typical meal there.  They also need to open up the large dining area (when I was there it didn't seem like we were allowed back there), because the main dining area is small and a bit cramped.  No big whoop though, really.  I enjoy supporting smaller 'mom and pop' eateries and restaurants, because more of the dollars tend to stay local."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for a bite for the first time today. We've passed it almost daily for years now. I always thought to check it out but never did until today...man do I regret that! This little place has great wraps and the service was superb. They will definitely be seeing us again!"}
{"text":"This place was everything I expected and more! I just moved to the area less than a week ago and have driven past this place a few times. My fiance and I wanted a quick meal, and decided to give this ago.  It's very cute inside. The menu is written on a chalkboard. (The kid menu is even written at kid height!!) There are brochures and business cards supporting local businesses inside, which I liked. The two girls working (high school age maybe??) were fantastic! I was so impressed by their service. They saw that we were unfamiliar with the menu and took the time to explain how the menu works and what the most popular wraps to order were. They also gave us a reward card that allows us to get a free wrap when we've reached a certain amount. My fiance ordered a Thai Peanut Chicken wrap (not sure if that is the actual name). I ordered something called the Chive Turkey. The food did not let us down. These wraps were packed with filling and all of the veggies were fresh and crispy. We definitely got what we paid for (wraps are all around $5-7). We will be back, a lot. You should try it too. It's a quick service healthy alternative to several of dining options nearby!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good staff, fast. Ordered the Pesto Chicken pizza and it was delicious! I will definitely be coming back for seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths."}
{"text":"\"Hey Roxy, want do you want to eat?\"   \"Arf.\"  \" A wrap? Cool. We can do that.\"  I saw this place a month or so back and finally popped in. Not really Middle Eastern, but more of a Dave's Cosmic Wraps. Many turkey, ham and veggie selections. I went with the Say Cheese(provolone, swiss, jack, lettuce, tomato, onion, dressing). The other veg options were too veg for me. Avocado, sprouts, hummus...nah, no thanks.  Not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, but a quick snack while on the go. The interior is cute and modern. Outdoor patio overlooks a semi busy stretch of Lorain. It actually would fit nicely in any college town or Lakewood. Very friendly workers and pretty cheap. I can see how local workers(what businesses are around i have no idea. The library or city hall?) could make it their fave lunch spot.   To tell you the truth, i don't really care for wraps. I prefer sandwiches. Wraps take all the layers of flavor from a sandwich and cram them together into a too solid hunk of food. But, i wanted to try the dressing and i enjoyed the final product. Did the pooch? Nope. She scoffed at it. If it ain't a McDonald's fish sandwich, she could give a crap. Oh, well. More for me."}
{"text":"Great quality food.  I can sum them up quickly...  This is the Jimmy John's of wraps. Get one, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Average, local pita shop. I wasnt too impressed with the customer service. Now, I wont slander the business due to a garbage employee but, I was unimpressed nonetheless. Its kind of too basic, nothing to catch your eye, no theme or anything that says, 'Come Back!'... So, I probably will not..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch on a weekday afternoon. Service was quick and friendly; food was inexpensive, but filling and yummy.   I had the Thai Chicken pita, which has chicken, cucumber, sprouts, avocado, lettuce and a spicy peanut sauce. It was tasty and plenty of food. I saved my chips for an afternoon snack.  When I was back in the area a week later, I made sure to stop by again! Tried the California chicken wrap this time. It has chicken, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato and house dressing. I'm not sure what the house dressing is, but it added a bit of a tangy taste to the wrap.  Great lunch place for anyone who works in the Fairview Park area."}
{"text":"***MORE***FREE SANDWICHES FOR EVERYBODY !  Got these for takeout:  CYCLONE CLUB * * * * * Ham, Turkey, Bacon, Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, House Dressing; Very good!  Dressing/mayo result was an unexpected very slightly sweet.  Not Miracle Whip sweet, just different for a club-style offering.   MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN * *  Chicken Breast, Red Pepper, Hummus, Feta, Lettuce, Tomato, Caesar Dressing; Not so good.  Maybe it was the combination of hummus, feta, and Caesar  dressing that didn't quite work for me.  Love all these ingredients in other dishes but learned real quick that not so much together.   First time all at once in single bites.  ech... * Now I'm not going to make a big issue, but knew I HAD to mention.  On both the take-out menu and the web site, this wrap description has a comma between  \"red pepper\" and \"hummus\", leading me to believe that these are two separate-distinct-from-each-other ingredients.  No.  But of course this wasn't discovered until it was already home, and after a couple of bites.  I called, and a nice guy said it's \"red pepper HUMMUS\".  This is not the same thing.  Far be it from me to ever consider joining the Punctuation Police, but there's a BIG difference between the two in both flavor and texture.  I told him it would be a good idea to tell people when they ordered.  What was expected was the crunch of red pepper---or at least the discernable flavor---of maybe 2 or 3 slices or rings.  Just to prove it to myself, I unrolled it again, and yes, I did see a few red flakes dotting the hummus smear.  (The Hummus Sphere !  Sounds like something from Tommy's on Coventry.  If they don't, they should.) (2 stars for the wrap---and not because of the punctuation.  I'll give them a C- for that.)  TOMATO BASIL BISQUE * * * * * Tomato soups are not my favorite, by far.  This was their soup that day, and it was delicious!  Creamy, smooth, mild, nicely seasoned---and very rich.  No sharp, pungent, screw-your-face-up-over heavily herbed or citrusy additions. Because of it's richness and 12oz. size, I'd recommend this as a share.    OVERALL * * * * Pita was very tasty, fresh, thinner style.  Each heavy wrap was like a little club---about 12\" long and 2.5\" wide.  I peeked inside the Cyclone before cutting it into more manageable portions, and was happy to see nice quality meats that I could quickly recognize.   Would definitely return and will try something else, too, but when ordering I won't be able to resist asking,           \"Does that come with or without comma's?\"  WORTH NOTING * When ordering you might want to confirm what you're actually getting.  I enjoy keeping on top of new foods, but I'm sure I miss some.  For all I know there might be Turkey Avocado's, Cucumber Sprouts, and Provolone Lettuce at my local Giant Eagle, but I just overlooked them.   *  Offering BUY 7 GET 1 FREE.  Ask for their business card. *  Call or pull up on web for Daily Specials.  The Cyclone Club menu price 6.95 but as a Daily Special with chips and beverage just 7.00.
