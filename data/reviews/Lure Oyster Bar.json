{"text":"Been here three times. My last time here!! Service was ok apart from the fact the server had no idea about the wine or how much it cost. Calamari was sent back we ordered several plates of this and all were sent back. Mussels came half open half closed , clams were like rubber. Our whole party had issues with their apps! Nachos had one shrimp and was so congealed it was unrecognizable ! If your going to offer Moscow mules on the menu please know how to make it and have the right cups !"}
{"text":"I revisited Lure Oyster bar on September 12th and the overall experience was much better. For appetizers we ordered a dozen and half raw oysters and a spinach dip. Both were good except I had one oyster that tasted really bad. The rest were fine. Out of all the entrees ordered, the scallops dinner stood out and was fantastic. The waiter we had was great and very knowledgeable of the menu and was able to explain all the differences in the oysters. As far as a negative, I do think the menu is limited and it is a bit pricey.  The parking is an absolute nightmare due to Bradshaws Social House and there are tons of kids running around due to Hawthornes Pizza right next door. So the atmosphere is very mixed.  I still don't think it would be my first choice for a dinner out but it did make for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Being a New England 'er, I appreciate fresh oysters!! These oyster were not fresh at all...as a matter of fact after questioning the waitress...she apologized and said \"they are switching it up every month\". Yuck...oysters should be fresh.  Even my salad was wrong! No cheese...really.  then you charge for the awful oysters. Sorry...not spending  $$ here again"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Lure.  Very knowledgable and friendly staff.  They have some unique items that are very good.  Of course the oysters were the reason we went, and they were well described by our waitress.  Can't wait to go back and try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here for the first time, absolutely love this place!!! The Grouper bites,  and crab fondue are AMAZING!  We also had the Margherita Pizza which was so fresh and recommended by the daytime chef! We were here for happy hour and it was such a nice croud! Had a great time, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I come here on Wednesdays, for the oysters special.... Sometimes you get big oysters and sometimes you get tiny ones, it's been a while since I've gotten the tiny ones.  (As of Aug 2016: First Wednesday of each month is 25cent oysters and the remaining Wednesdays are 35cents from 4pm-10pm, depending on availability). I try to order all my dozens upfront...it can take a while on Wednesdays! The other menu items are alright, nothing great...same with the cocktails. The space was decked out with TVs, there's a pool table and outdoor patio which is nice."}
{"text":"Keep in mind I have never written a bad review in my life. Worst experience ever. Was told our oysters would be a while so we went ahead and ordered food. Our food came n still no oysters. 30 min later the server came by with our check and we still hadn't received out oysters. Table behind us received 3 oyster orders while we waited. Had to wait another 15 minutes before an angry server dumper a plate of oysters on our table n stormed off. They were lopsided n upside down. Half of the oysters were out of the shell.  Waited another 30 minutes for server to come back with with a check. I finally gave up and went to the car-my husband waited another 15 min. I will NEVER come back and I will make sure none of my friends do either. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"While I've been a fan of Lures for a couple of months -- My visit on 7/22/15 was LESS than stellar.  I know that oysters are \"out of season\" -- But these were pathetic (somewhere between the size of a dime and a nickel and often difficult to even find in their half shelves !!  But the service is inpectable and that's the reason I conitnue to go during the summer months  Yesterday -- Both Kelly and Jerrad were exceptionally helpful to me.  Hopefully this post gets back to their bosses !!!"}
{"text":"Crab dip was good except the server said it would come with toasted pita and it instead came out with tortilla chips. Fried shrimp platter was good but only had 8-10 shrimp so don't go there hungry. Oyster pizza was a disappointment as it only had 5 oysters and the crust was not crispy. Overall, somewhat \"boring\" and under-whelming visit. Didn't hate it but didn't really love it either..."}
{"text":"First thing is I am from New England and grew up 3 miles from the ocean. Fresh seafood is kind of in my blood. My dad and I went there to see what Charlotte has to offer for oysters. One thing I have learned over the years of fishing and working on my uncle's lobster boat is, \"if no one is eating the seafood at a restaurant don't order it.\"  Not one person was eating oysters!!  
I will say the bartenders were great and made great martinis. Definitely more pub fare than anything. If you want a great place to watch a game and have some cocktails this will work. If you are expecting an oyster bar don't bother."}

{"text":"Ok so a busy Saturday night no servers no Ac? What are they thinking???? Very disappointing"}
{"text":"The Buffet Died

The OLD seafood buffet at $17.99 WAS perfect.
Oysters, crab legs, and shrimp with breakfast and brunch items. 
Lure claimed they re-vamped the buffet, they didn't. 
They killed the buffet. 
Removed the crab legs and shrimp, but didn't alter the price. What a horrible experience. 
A simple heads up from the server would have been nice. \"Hey, the buffet has changed!\" 
Nope, she let us sit down, bent us over, and shoved a $40 check for 2 directly in us. For bacon and eggs might I add. Carton eggs. 
It's okay to make your customers aware that something isnot right or the same. That's how you build loyalty and trust.
Never again will I be screwed like that. Last time I will step foot in Lure. 
TODAY I was SCREWED OVER."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte from New England and was looking forward to the brunch. Our server, David, was great, but the food, kitchen, and management were horrible. The cream for my coffee was clumpy, the omelet with extra cheese had zero cheese, 2 out of the 3 sides of grits were the same size while the 3rd was half the size of the others, and the oysters weren't fresh at all. When we asked to speak with the manager, she was rude and placed all blame on our server despite us saying he was awesome and the issue was with the kitchen. As for the unfresh oysters, she told me that was impossible since they get deliveries 2x a week. As a New England gal who loves oysters, this is not frequent enough for a restaurant with \"oyster bar\" in its name. Eat their seafood at your own risk and prey you don't have to deal with the unprofessional floor manager who worked today's brunch."}
{"text":"Loved this place in the past. Wonderful atmosphere....absolutely not liking it tonight! Loud music and TV kills the beautiful outdoor atmosphere. I came here over Pearl, but wish I had stuck with PEARL..they changed the menu and I could have gone to any BAR and got the same.....my recommendation is to skip it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Our server, Emerald, was very helpful and attentive. Obviously, they oysters were a must. Crab fondue, corn fritters and shrimp and grits were also fantastic. We are looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This.place.is.horrible.  Honestly, in my 8 years living in Charlotte, have not had a worse experience at a restaurant. The service was awful, and a lot of that had to do with the manager!!  When I received a $10 glass of wine that contained probably 3 sips of white wine, I questioned it and the waitress sent the manager over... he very condescendingly remarked that it was a \"5 oz pour\" and walked away.  Then, after waiting FOREVER to order and for our food, I received my salmon, and it was completely raw inside, even cold (I had ordered it medium well).  The same manager was walking by, and I told him that the fish was raw, and he took my plate away - I never saw my food again.  I looked to flag down a server and finally our waitress came back asking if she could get us \"anything else\" and I told her that the manager had taken my meal and never brought it back.  She had this surprised look on her face, said she would check on it, and still, 15 minutes later, she had not come back.  When she finally returned, she asked again \"can I get anyone anything?\" and I said, \"Only my meal which you were supposed to be checking on and was never brought to me...  Just bring us the check.\"  She walked away, then returned to the table, and said \"I'm so sorry, we'll take that salmon off the check.\"  Umm, you think?   Awful.  Everyone else I was with had a horrible meal too - like watery still ice cold/frozen lobster roll and  tiny plate of tacos that had flakes of dried fish in it.  

Can't wait for Pearlz Oyster Bar to arrive in Stonecrest!!"}
{"text":"So poor it bordered on the surreal.

This establishment seems to have a dream scenario:  excellent location that serves as its own billboard near a busy intersection, an attractive exterior and a stylish interior that reflects the nautical theme without overt kitsch like diver's helmets, life preservers or taxidermy fish hanging on the walls.

Unfortunately, it was the ultimate case of style over substance as horrid food and worse service had us wondering if we were on hidden camera with the limits of our patience being tested.  The lowlights:

-We sat at the bar.  The bartop was strewn with cellophane and cracker crumbs from the previous guest(s).  The bartender didn't offer to clean it and when we asked politely for same she stared at us as if we had asked her to recite Shakespeare from memory.

-After this initial encounter, the bartender merely wandered off.  She didn't offer menus.  She didn't ask for a drink order.  The bar is round yet both the bartenders managed, somehow, to remain hidden from view for nearly our entire visit.  Finally, bartender B came over.  She didn't take our drink order, per se, she merely asked 'Did bartender A take your drink order?'

-A quarter of an hour after walking in and seating ourselves, we finally obtained our beverages.  Ordering a Guinness was probably always going to end in tears in this place.  They served it in a standard beer glass, not a tulip glass.  Guinness always requires an initial pour, then a few minutes to settle, some of the head removed, then a final top-off.  Our girl at the bar merely served it up about 2/3 full with the foam filling the rest.  Clever portion control or mere cluelessness?

-After waiting to a) order drinks and b) obtain menus, we waited another long
 spell to order.  It's one of life's great mysteries when wait/bar staff express surprise that guests with menus in hand wish to order food.

-We ordered a sandwich and a plate of tacos, respectively, with a dozen oysters as an appetizer.  There aren't many universal rules in the restaurant biz but serving the appetizer (i.e. the starter) before the entrée is probably one of them.  Nevertheless, in a rare case of 'undesirable kitchen efficiency' my tacos were presented to me in a flash - with still no sign of the appetizer and no mention of it by the bartender.  The kitchen and bar staff, bless them, saw fit to cover the entire edge of the plate with visible thumbprints - it looked like a page from an FBI database.

-Eventually the oysters arrived along with the sandwich.  The sandwich bun was a scrawny, mass-produced, white-bread specimen that Aldi would be embarrassed to sell.  The mahi therein was ice cold.  None of the condiments named on the menu were included and, inevitably, the bartender expressed shock not that they were missing but that we had the temerity to ask for them.

-Both bartenders then disappeared into the black hole at the center of the bar.  No follow-up on drinks.  No check of food quality (perhaps they knew full well it was rubbish and were afraid to ask).  Our lengthy spells of downtime did allow us to observe them in their native element.  Bartender A kept her beer bottle opener stuck down the back waistband of her sweat pants i.e. tucked snugly against her underwear or, more likely, her bare backside.  Handy for her but probably not very hygienic for the unwitting beer drinker placing his mouth where the opener had just been.

-We ate what we could, our appetites dulled by the food's shocking quality and temperature, but still couldn't free ourselves from the gilded prison since the bartenders refused to acknowledge that we hadn't taken a bite in eons, that we had pushed our plates away, and that our glasses stood empty.  After another interminable stretch we were finally able to ask for our check.

-When we pointed out as politely as we could that the fish in the sandwich was cold, we got an grudging, insincere 'Sorry' and a shrug of the shoulders.  No offer to remove it from the bill.  No offer to replace it, even to go.

-As others have pointed out, a nearly empty restaurant on a Saturday at 6 PM should be an ominous, obvious sign to turn away which we ignored to our detriment.

Nobody asked us on the way out to sign a release form so we won't be on reality TV after all as the subjects of an elaborate wind-up.  Unfortunately, this means that every sordid relentless detail was intentional or merely the result of apathy."}
{"text":"Still the best in the area. Inside or outside on the nice covered patio with Tvs. Luv the food."}
{"text":"Beware my fellow \"Yellow Rose\" alumni...NEW MENU as of summer '16. Sure they have all the seafood from before, but the burgers/ sandwich options are gone.

Gone is the Yellow Rose Burger. Now you have 1 burger choice and it's just as bland as getting one next door at Bradshaw's ( yes, same owner)
Gone are things like: French Dip, Cheesesteak Sandwich, Buffalo Chicken wraps, etc

They still have wings, but on the new menu ALL the flavors are not listed. It says \"ask your server\". Well the folks at Lure used to have a long list of flavors brought over from the Yellow Rose. I'm not sure how long the list is, because even the server didn't know. We stopped at Thai flavor. The wings were off too. Not as crispy as before and drenched in sauce...almost like cook them for any flavor and add sauce later.

Yes I'm still bitter about the Yellow Rose closing, but the sadness was minimal knowing that Lure had comparable food...not anymore.  Oysters were o.k. the few times we ordered them, but not enough for us to go back. We won't be back

I say good luck focusing on your seafood menu.

p.s. Why does your menu have a freshwater/ fly fishing lure on it? Yup it's a lure, but why wouldn't you use a saltwater lure....where your menu items come from?"}
{"text":"I went here on a THURSDAY night to get dinner with my boyfriend. We dressed casual on a weekday night. We got inside and  the hostess just look at us with a additutte face. The first thing she said was do y'all want to sit outside because there's no tank top allow. Are you serious? It's was 8 at night! I'm just trying to sit down and have dinner, I don't want to sit outside! It's was humid and rainy.

I didn't know this place was that \"high end\" where you have to dress up for oyster bar, y'all only have $$ on yelp! 

Will never returns!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, which we did oysters, wish that they would cut the eye loose from the shell like they do on the coast, but they were good and the weekday specials are great. The waitstaff was friendly, but no ball of fire. We will continue to eat there!"}
{"text":"They just changed menu from fantastic to country fried cheap.. Sadly this was a favorite of mine but now it's so bad that I'll be looking elsewhere.. Probably should change name from Lure as it doesn't lure me anymore.."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and it was not good! We ordered the mahi tacos and mahi entree. The fish had a fishy taste and was very dry.
The sides didn't have any flavor. To top it off, the service was very slow and some things didn't come at all. It took 15 minutes to get the check. I hope things improve but I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The hostesses were awful and once they seated us we waited a while and a waiter never came to greet us. The music was extremely loud and the menu did not excite us so we walked out. The hostesses didn't care to ask why we were leaving so soon or even say goodbye."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the oysters. Would definitely come back for both those and the all you can eat crab legs on Thursday's. They just really need to get their staff situation sorted out. They were short staffed the last night we came, and service was honestly terrible. All the tables around us looked very frustrated as they were left waiting for drinks, food, ect way out of the normal/standard time regarding steps of service. Hire more people Lure!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great service, fresh food and good specials. Wednesday night $.25 oysters and Thursday all you can eat crab legs. Awesome"}
{"text":"Sitting here now and ordered the crab fondue. Plate came and all I have is tortilla chips  and cheese dip. Still searching for the crab so maybe stick around?

Ordered the cod sliders which had no taste and it was frozen fish with cheese.

Next.... We had the buffalo shrimp. The buffalo shrimp were so strong with buffalo sauce we needed extra water. Though I didn't try but my friend said the coleslaw was \"funky\".

Also, we had 6 steamed oysters. Hopefully you can't mess up oysters being an oyster bar, right!?!? One oyster was so steamed we passed it up.

I am very disappointed as this was \"supposedly\" an oyster bar."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch one day so I haven't tried the rest of the menu and I only came for one thing for brunch. Oysters. $19 for all you can eat oysters is great. The oysters were very large and filling. Definitely a great deal if you are always on the look-out for good oysters like I am. The brunch only offers the house oysters, but there is a large variety available for lunch and dinner. I'd like to try all of them."}
{"text":"We love to hit Lure on Wednesdays after work.  25 cent oysters on Weds and all-you-can-eat crab legs on Thursday for $25 are a serious draw, as well as great martinis and appetizers.  They just added new menu items, including Lobster Mac and Cheese as well as Pimento Cheese Oysters and several cold options. This is a fun experience if you can be patient because some nights, when oysters are in season, they are PACKED.  The servers are polite and try to be quick in spite of steady tables and turn over.

They also have live jazz at least one night a week.  Definitely worth a try if you love sea food and oysters.  I definitely give it a 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here really lost something after the change from Cosmos. It seems very drab and plain. The food is ok at best. In the weekends they turn a small portion of the place into a \"dance floor\"."}
{"text":"Spent over $100 per couple for what should have been $30 per couple.  Food was not good, service was terrible.  The waitress while very pleasant, would forget items.  My friend waited 45 min for a glass of wine.  all the meals came out, but my husbands arrived 15 min later.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"As a restaurant it's soso. Honestly nothing special. But, I think alot of people use this place as a bar. Again just like Bradshaw. You will see the same people. Same crowd. And it really gets boring. The only reason I'll give it an extra star is because the service is up to par and you don't need to deal with fake ass girl attitudes"}
{"text":"I've been to Lure three times. The first time - not so great, but they had just opened so I could understand. I was not happy with the tacos I got - I have completely forgotten which kind I ordered but they had some kind of spice on them that was very prominent and ruined the taste. The second time, MUCH better. We went on a Wednesday when they had 25 cent oysters on the half shell and half priced martinis and flatbreads. Everything was perfect. The flat bread with the braised short rib, fried shallots - Mmm mm!! To die for, and at half price, win!! Oysters were nice and fresh, delicious - I will say that they need to learn how to shuck the oysters, the muscle was attached to almost all of them, not good.

We went for our third time this morning for their Sunday brunch and we were so satisfied. For $17 they had a full buffet with fresh seafood (shrimp, crab legs, oysters), made to order omelets, a bloody mary bar, and more. Plus $10 bottomless mimosas that were made with the perfect champagne to OJ ratio so you could actually get a nice buzz. :)

Also had a very nice waitress, I wish I remembered her name (maybe it's the mimosas) but she was very nice - great waiters/waitresses always add to the experience. A+ in my book. They did have a DJ, for a Sunday brunch...cool with me but may not be for others."}
{"text":"We went here for the fresh rappahanock oysters.  The weren't much bigger than the size of a nickel and the price was ungodly.  Lure has great curb appeal and the inside is very nice as well, but for quality of food and price, we will not be back again."}
{"text":"We ordered two trays of steamed oysters.  I guess I should have anticipated that NC oyster would be the size of a dime to a nickel,  Still, at 25 cents they were good.

My wife ordered the Lobster Roll which had very little Lobster.  I ordered the fried oyster and shrimp plate.  It looked pretty big until I realized that it was due to a massive mound of potato rounds.  this is the first time that I did not eat all of the seafood.  The oysters and shrimp were over breaded and over fried.  I think they need to change the oil.  It was an AWFUL meal.

I wasn't going to say anything until the waitress asked how the meal was - so I told her!
I expected to see the manger, but she merely brought the $54 bill.

On the way out I looked at a pile of fish on a patrons plate that again was over breaded and burnt.

I don't know how they stay in business!"}
{"text":"While the location is perfect, the dining experience was not. My husband and I had dinner at Lure on 9/6/14. We did not have reservations, but we did not need one and were seated outside at our request. The server was courteous and took our drink orders - my husband ordered wine and I an ice tea. She returned with our drinks and two glasses of water. The wine pour was a disappointment which was a harbinger of things to come.

Because it was an oyster bar, we ordered a starter of a full platter of \"house\" oysters - read: oysters the size and appearance of a 6 year-old's spittle. It came with horseradish, cocktail sauce and some indescribable beet colored liquid. Sadly the oysters never make it to the sauce because they slip through the fork and disappear somewhere in the ice chips.

Dinner: we ordered the fish tacos - One order of Ahi tuna and one of Mahi-Mahi. Each order comes with a side of rice. While waiting for the dinner order my husband ordered a beer. I suggested he order a can and a glass, but he ordered a draft beer instead. Big mistake. The glass is not a beer glass, if you follow me. Our order arrives. My tacos were suppose to have a mango mixture - I was expecting a mango salsa concoction - what I got: three small pieces of tuna and smallish chunks of mango. My husband's fish tacos had thin slices the size of an index finger.

We left hungry and not returning."}
{"text":"amble seating,large bar area,great selection of oysters waitress very knowledgable"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight and we were absolutely amazed at our entire experience. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff is all very friendly. 

We started out with the crab fondue and house oysters on the half shell. The crab fondue was phenomenal. It was full of huge chunks of crab meat and yummy cheese. The chips were good too and extra crispy. I was surprised at how meaty and high quality the house oysters were especially for $1 each. The cocktail sauce was perfect with just the right amount of horseradish.

Entrees were the lobster roll with grilled asparagus and the shrimp and grits. The lobster roll was great! They gave a generous amount of lobster. The bread was garlic bread baked and then turned inside out. The asparagus had a great grilled smoky taste. The shrimp and grits had really awesome flavor to it. 

We loved everything so we decided we had to get dessert even though we were painfully stuffed. We got the blackberry cobbler topped with ice cream. It was absolutely delicious!! Lindsey gave phenomenal service. We plan to come back again next week!"}
{"text":"It used to be another place called Cosmos which was as loud as Charlotte-Douglas Airport runways.. The food is different and it's seems it caters to families, at least for Sunday brunch. But, unfortunately, the noise levels haven't come down as music wasn't in the background, it was extremely loud and I had trouble hearing friends right across the table from me. People were talking and/or watching sports on several big screens. No one was listening to music. I'd recommend Lure when the decibels come down. Thank you."}
{"text":"Well it seems that the wife and I just had to move out of Ballantyne for the good restaurants to move in. We were lucky to be in the area recently and saw that Lure was open for business. We had heard that an oyster bar was coming to Charlotte and that made both of us excited. 

First thing that I noticed walking in was the revamped decor to give you the oyster shack feel. It also looks like they have few seats for a raw bar, as well as ample regular bar seating. For our quick lunch on this visit, we opted for a high top table, but in the future I would either do a booth or sit at the bar. The menu itself is quite varied and not only seafood/oyster driven, which is fine to please all types of palates. We were there for seafood to include raw oysters. We got six each of their northwest oysters from British Columbia and they were delicious. I would have asked for some hot sauce or sriracha, as none was on the table but we were in a rush and the oysters looked too good to wait. We used the cocktail sauce and mignonette provided. As entree, I chose the Bar Harbor lobster roll and the wife went with crab cake sandwich. Now I have had some lobster rolls in my time and this one is legit. It's served cold, as it should be, and on a warm toasted bun with a good filling portion of lobster. I doubt that the lobster was freshly shucked but it doesn't have to be, and we are quite a ways away from Bar Harbor, so I don't expect it. Oh and the house chips were perfect for me, thick, crispy and not greasy. I tasted the crab cake itself and it was good, but the lobster was better. The wife is allergic to lobster so she could not indulge in the roll.

All in all, a solid meal and it was definitely 4+ stars, but can't pull the trigger on 5 stars yet. The service was fine and I am sure that them being open for a week explains the few hiccups that we encountered. We will likely return as often as we can and trust me, my upgrade to 5 stars is coming. I look forward to new different oysters varietals and seasonal dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday afternoon. Lots of indoor/outdoor seating and a great bar area. We had a dozen raw oysters and then tried the tuna and Mahi tacos. Everything was great and a great value. The service was courteous and prompt. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We have been to Lure multiple times and have always had excellent food and service. I recommend the Hushpuppy Fried Oysters. These are ahhmazing!"}
{"text":"service was horrible, took over an hour to get bill right,in the end we just over payed and left. 3 people ended up with food poising a few hours after leaving those 3 people had the crab legs. we called 3 times to talk to a manager whom never returned the call, one girl just laughed on the phone. it is really to bad since it is a nice place. and i am sure those crab legs were served the following day making more people sick."}
{"text":"My husband and I love oysters and were so excited to give this place a shot. We ordered a dozen house oysters and devoured them in no time. Our waitress recommended the green tobasco and lemon with the oysters and that hands down is now my favorite way to eat them. My husband ordered steak fries, the mahi taco, fried oyster taco, and shrimp taco. Of those three the mahi was our favorite. I ordered the tuna tacos and they were delicious!!! The mango relish was great with the tuna. The only thing I didn't like was the grilled asparagus. They were large, which I found visually appealing, but I was not a fan of the taste and won't order that again. Next to the oysters, our favorite part of our experience was actually our waitress, Arielle. From now on we will request her when we go."}
{"text":"I visited Lure oyster bar Wednesday, October 14. This happened to be $.25 house select oyster night in which tonight's selects where Gulf oysters.  

When I called on the phone I was told all oysters were $.25. Much to my surprise, I learned when I received my bill that only the house select oysters were $.25 each. 

Now that was my bad for not being more inquisitive.  

The Bluepoint oysters were very good and the PEI oysters were adequate. The reason for my two star rating of Lure is based on poor information provided by the receptionist and the obvious new employee that was working behind the bar on this night. She exhibited  poor customer service skills and a very cold shoulder. Knowing what I know now, if I did return to Lure oyster bar, I would not be in my right mind and desperate for some oysters. I would only go on the discount oysters Wednesday night. I will select oyster confirming the price prior to ordering and I would sit at a table where a waitress would be more receptive and attentive  to my needs as a paying customer who spent almost 100 bucks."}
{"text":"Loved this bar! The food was good, excellent customer service, & they played great music. Everyone was extremely friendly. Their cosmo's are to die for! Drinks are strong which I looove. Saturday night's are the most packed usually."}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment from the water served in plastic cups to the server telling me a side salad was a Caesar salad. My bad, I had never been there so I thought Lure (great name) was going to like a Legal Seafood. Nope.  It's another Sports bar with TVs everywhere enough to distract even the best storyteller. The water was served in plastic cups, we were charged for extra chips which we had to wait for until the dip turned solid and cold.  We were not offered glasses for our beers and the mixed drinks were overpriced.  On to the food....my table mate was charged for a side to her dinner, the jimbalaya had too much tomato, the ahi was cooked not seared, and the appetizer crab cakes were mushy dollops of cold crabby stuff.  I ordered a side Caesar salad which finally came after we were all finished with our meals and it was a salad with iceburg, tomato, shredded bagged cheese and bacon bits with some 
Romano Italian bottled dressing on the side. All three of us told the server that this was not a Caesar salad and she proceeded to argue that yes it was.  This being an oyster bar, my husband ordered oysters, and he enjoyed them(hence the one star) but our inept server did not know anything about oysters, or for that matter salads, sides, how to split a check, or bring out a tables' meal all at once.    Good thing we were with friends, otherwise the night would have been a total waste ."}
{"text":"Ummm yeah, so from the outside you expect that this place is somewhat upper middle... little upscale...you want it to be that...you want it to be fresh seafood along with oysters, clams, and the tuna carpaccio I heard about which is the only reason why we came.... all of it is no, no, no, no... we walk in to a fairly empty restaurant first off that should have been a sign on a Saturday evening at 8:15 pm which my husband and I consider pretty much smack dab in the middle of prime time...this should have been out first sign! 

Looking around the atmosphere wants to be upscale but it's confused, and then there's just sports on tvs, and loud overserved drunks at the bar, servers dressed like they rolled out of bed, flip flops and all... one even had a shirt that said drunk 1 on it

 Our waitress comes over she is pleasent, we order our drinks, me a Sav blanc, him a margarita. Hubby said margarita was horrible.  I then asked about the tuna carpaccio and apparently the menu changed because they merged with something called the yellow rose?  Well anyway, I was already disappointed.. I expected seafood.. not burgers where I can get amazing burgers at bradshaws, or pizza when you can get amazi ng pizza at hawthornes. ..or sandwiches... so so so disappointed at the horribly designed menu that you can barely keep your eyes focused on one item long enough to read it in its entirety, and the glorified BAR FOOD....bleh. 

I then asked how the oysters were she said \"big, they are from maryland\" I also ordered a chicken ceasar salad.... guess what came out first.... the waitress brings me out my grilled chicken ceasar salad FIRST.  Um HELLO.... I say whoa... the oysters should come out first because they are an appetizer... she says oh it takes longer to shuck the oysters than make the chicken so I brought this out first, do you want me to bring this back in the kitchen?...I'm thinkin what so you can screw with it...but I say no its fine just leave it!

Shortly the oysters come out.. and they are pathetic... mushy texture, small,  and we got a bad one... so I call her over and say excuse me we got a bad one (whi ch the person preparing should have noticed but clearly didn't care... she had the gall to say as she brought another one to us.. oh sometimes they come out dark brown... um honey, that means they are not good! Lol 
We also found they have 25 cent oysters on wednesdays...let me put it this way... I wouldn't even pay that for them
So yeah, we will not be returning.
Our waitress was as nice as she could have been , working with ignorant no common sense cooks... and such a low standard the owners must have when it comes to servers... I even think their free website isn't even working.. WOOOWWWWW waste of $50 for 2 low grade drinks, 24 oysters and a salad"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for crablegs. ..despite other reviews...I had a great expirience here.  Our bartender  Ariel was attentive and sweet.... never had to wait very long between servings...and the crablegs were hot and steamed perfectly.   We also had the house oysters for an appetizer and they were fresh and chilled perfectly.   Im glad I came despite the bad reviews.  Oh! Bonus! 1/2 price bottles of wine on Thurs!"}
{"text":"Read reviews. Please. Read. Reviews. All correct. Food bad. Food not just bad...awful. Sent everything back. Large group of us unhappy and won't be back. Feel pretty bad about even writing this only because we were invited to support a friend. But the food was BAD."}
{"text":"Oysters were on steroids which was not a good thing.   Fried seafood plate was good enough to eat for two days.   Atmosphere was dead for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We found a LIVE WORM on one of the dozen house oysters we ordered. I'm no oyster connoisseur but I would imagine a live worm is unacceptable? It was still wiggling on the edge of the oyster shell. I'm guessing that means it's as fresh as can be? Another thing to note is most of the oyster shells didn't look like there was any attempt to clean or scrub them before opening as they had dirt and grime all over it. All management offered was a refund on the oysters, and gave us 3 of their \"premium and cleanest\" oysters that they had to offer. I felt like our entire meal should have been comp'ed. Other people in our party a variety of tacos and everyone agreed that they wasn't anything special about them. Midway through our meal, they dimmed the lights and turned on some club music, but there wasn't enough people in the bar/restaurant for that type of \"ambience\". All in all, it is an overpriced restaurant that I think is still trying to find its identity, and please make sure you don't give people worms!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I don't like oysters and will not eat raw fish this far inland during the summer time so although this place is an oyster bar, I know nothing about their actual oysters.  But I can tell you about a few of the other things on their menu. First of all, the shrimp tacos are bomb. They're cheap, delicious, and filling. The jasmin rice that comes with it is whatever but you can change it out to the round potato fries which are uh freaking mazing.  The cod sliders are also really good and they have this tangy citrus jam that goes on the bottom. Do not have the sliders without that sauce because !  And I've only had a taste of their shrimp and grits but that was really good too. 

The environment is pretty chill and relax. They have a cool bar in the middle of the restaurant, presumably for those wild cats who want to let loose during the night. But if you're young and want to party it up, I don't think I'd come by here despite the bar because every time it seems like there are a lot of older people here. If 30s is your crowd then this seems to be your place but in your 20s, I'd go elsewhere for a fun night."}
{"text":"Eat first then come here for music and a good bar. Oysters must have still been in the embryonic stage. But that would have been ok if they were at least clean. Burger was about as taste free as a piece of stale gum. Calamari was a mistake. Beer was cold. Live music was good. Just don't go here on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed the all-you-can-eat crab legs on Thursday night. It's a nice place for family. The brick oven pizza was really good, a lil too big for the kids menu but that's what to go boxes are for! The wait staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was nice, casual dress."}
{"text":"BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY!

Pretty sure I spent a record amount of money for brunch at this place, but overall it was worth it. Came here with 2 of my cousins when we found out that they had unlimited oysters for brunch. Coming from a city only 2 hours away from Louisiana, I'm well versed in the art of raw oysters. 

I arrived around noon to see the place semi-full, and proceeded to be seated by a table next to the bar (strategic purposes) ready for my feast. We ordered the unlimited oysters/brunch and the unlimited mimosas for ~$35 tax and tip, so it was pretty pricey for what we got. Here's the general experience:

Normal brunch area: 
- Coming with our all you can eat oyster special is the actual normal brunch buffet. They have the usual eggs, sausage and gravy, fruits, etc. Somethnig I didn't expect was seafood, including a seafood papaya, which was absolutely delicious. It was filled with mussels, clams, and shrimp in rice. The sauce on the side was just what you needed to put it over the top. Great addition.

The Oysters:
- Really.. Just take my money... Oysters came by the dozen and were replenished in a decent time. The interesting part is you can get them steamed or grilled upon request. Personally I liked the raw oysters with some hot sauce, but to each their own. We finished 6 trays between the 3 of us, making it totally worth the price we paid (I sort of ate a little more than the other 2). Oysters were clean and big, definitely worthy of digging in your wallet. 

Mimosas:
- Option to do unlimited. They dont jip you on the champange (why would you want half champange anyway, it makes the mimosa taste terrible). That is all.

Overall, if you want to spend and like oysters, A LOT, check this place out. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch, with all you can eat oysters and bottomless mimosas. Every time I com here service and food are on point. Good job!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Lots of choices of good seafood and the flatbread makes for a good variety to please everyone. The staff is greatly and huddles but it is a popular place so expect it to be crowded. Because of the concrete floors it is very loud"}
{"text":"Just opened off of Rae rd. in the Blakeney/Ballantyne area of Charlotte.
Went there on Saturday afternoon so things weren't too busy.
Tried the raw oysters, tuna tartare and lobster roll. All of the seafood was extremely fresh and tasty.
Service was fast and servers were courteous and responsive.
This place has tons of indoor and outdoor seating and looks like it would be great for groups. 
They offer a Sunday brunch that we will be sure to try. 
We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I love the place ! but...... the service is good one day and awful the next 2...can't figure it out...When Julia was there...she was on top of everything. always.every time. New girl now? Destiny....not so much....When she FINALLY came to wait on us after 25 minutes  she rushed us through everything. Barely took a drink a beer and she was asking if we were done and needed another.... still had half a plate of fried pickles ....she wanted to take them. bought the food out wanted to know if we needed a to go box... Please slow down !!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with two others. To start out, the service was not very good and some of our food came out cold. For the food itself, we started out with some clam chowder, it wasn't very creamy at all, it was more brown in color. The chowder was decent, not bad but nothing to write home about. Two members of the party had flatbreads which I would not at all call flatbreads, they were pizzas. They were overly cheesy which covered up the seafood and basically just turned it into a greasy pizza. We also had the grouper tacos, which were lacking in flavor. The pineapple salsa on the tacos was good, but there wasn't enough of it! There was however, a lot of juice from the salsa that soaked the tortillas and made them quite soggy.
Overall, a very negative experience and we will not be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love... love Lure! it is a cozy spot for seafood. If you love seafood, this is a go to place. I love their shrimp cocktail, they call it peel amd eat shrimp.. fresh and crunchy. Decent size. My favorite is Pan Seared Diver Scallops, it has lentils, cauliflower puree, baby spinach, green beans and demi glaze.. which compliment the flavor altogether. The scallops is cooked the way I like it, the flavor is amazing.  Try their cobbler dessert is awesome too! oh.. ask for Klaudia and Cassandra. They are awesome, sweet and pretty cool! the best server in town. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for a girls date night for 25 cent oyster night. Food was phenomenal and so was the drinks. However, the service was terrible. They were very understaffed for a busy night (everyone wants 25 oysters). It took forever to receive our drinks and food. All the tables around us grew very frustrated and over took our conversations with complaining. Our waiter was super sweet, but didn't even work there. If you run specials at a restaurant you should be prepared for the volume."}
{"text":"My experience did not agree with the other reviews,  I was here for Sunday brunch at one and was immediately seated. Our waitress Monique was attentive and helpful. At no point did my drink run dry, and I enjoyed all the buffet choices."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing. Stopped in on a Saturday night and it was not very busy. Hostess was very pre-occupied and took a while to seat us. The server Told us about the specials, one of which was a low country boil! She said that had crab and shrimp and a whole lot of other stuff that she wasn't really sure about. We  ordered some raw oysters and oysters Rockefeller for appetizers. They took a very long time and came out ten minutes apart. The oysters were very small and gritty. The Rockefeller app was only Luke warm and flavorless. We then ordered a petite filet and a lobster roll for our main courses. The petite filet was extremely petite for $27 and the lobster roll was lacking flavor, skimpy and served on a very uninspiring sub roll. If you are going to call yourself an oyster bar, you should really do them well. At $75 for a dinner for two it was NOT worth the time or money."}
{"text":"This place has really evolved into a cool place. Live music on the patio and $3 drafts on Friday night. Great service and brunch is good too."}
{"text":"Me and the wifey finally made it to this place. We are big seafood/oyster fans and as most of you know there are few options for good oysters in CLT area. Oysters were good but way pricey. Everything else was an epic FAIL. Service was weak. Bartenders and servers were lethargic. Draft beer was flat. We sat in bar area at a hightop and watched beer after beer get returned for same reason. Bartender did nothing to adjust CO2. He was more concerned with the FSU-NCSU football game. Wife ordered glass of Chardonnay  and the pour on the wine was very weak as well. Maybe a 1/4 glass full. Other food besides oysters were disappointing. Salad was dry and looked old and tasted bland. Left at 6: 45 on Saturday evening and the place had 12 people inside. Unless late night rocks it out this place won't make it. Disappointing way to start a Saturday night. Two stars only because oysters were fresh and did taste good."}
{"text":"Lure feels just like Cosmos but with more fish on the menu. My friend and I went on a Tuesday evening around 6:30, and the inside only had a few parties inside, which is tricky in such a large, open space, but the outside seemed a little more crowded.

Our waitress, Emerald, was fun and engaging, and she was spot on with her service. That was the most noteworthy part of the whole visit.

The food was okay. They were having $2 tacos, so I got a pulled pork and a BBQ chicken, and my friend got a shrimp and a traditional. She said the tacos were good but a little cold, and mine were... fine. I got wine, but she got beer, and her Triple C IPA was served in the same glass as our water, which was TINY.

One last oddity to note is that they don't have a website, so the only way to see their menu, find out their hours, etc. is to go to their Facebook page, which is annoying. 

I'm not in any hurry to go back, and I'll honestly be surprised if they make it. If you liked Cosmos, and you like decent seafood, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! My fiancé and I have been violently ill from the seafood we ate there. We had oysters, cod sliders and the crab dip and he also had some clam chowder, we thought we would give this place a try but we have been sick for the last 24 hours from food poisoning! please be careful! We have been miserable and this was the only place we ate at this week and within 36 hours we were both sick as dogs. Never again!!! please take this seriously trust me you don't want to get this sick!!! The food wasn't flavorful and overall was not any good and to top it off getting sick from food poisoning ensured we will not be back!!! If I could give a zero star review I would!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  Restaurant completely empty and still bad service.  Now the food, not only is the service bad but you guessed it so is the food.  So bad we left after appetizers.  I got six oysters and it took them I don't know how long to bring them.  Six, my 7 yr old could shuck six in six minutes.  We ordered clams in butter, didn't know clams could be that small.  Wife got a wedge, how do you mess up a wedge??!!  Remember restaurant still not even half full.  Should have read yelp before going.  

Seriously heed my warning and others about this place.  You actually have to put in effort to be this bad."}
{"text":"I don't know why the people in here are smiling, this place sucks. Interested in not so fresh fish? Come on down! Want to have a sandwich on a roll/bun that's bought from Harris Teeter? This is your place! Want to over pay for a mediocre dinner? Lure (Danny D's with ambiance) would love to have you!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I didn't go with the review recommendation of going somewhere else. Not only was it $3 draft night but also house oysters were $1 each. I was expecting small oysters for that price, however, they were pretty good size and delicious. I ordered the hanger steak, never having one before. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. The Yukon gold potatoes and grilled asparagus were the perfect combination for the steak. I am leaving stuffed. I would've given five stars but my boyfriend didn't quite enjoy his food as much as I was favoring each bite."}
{"text":"The best thing about Lure is....it's logo!  If you call yourself an oyster bar, the ONE thing you should get right are the oysters.  We ordered a dozen steamed and, I kid you not, they arrived the shape/size of a raisin.  Sent them back, ordered a dozen raw...were actually pretty good except the fact that 4 of the 12 arrived slaughtered...get shuckers that can shuck an oyster without slicing through the oysters themselves!  Salad arrived pre-dressed with ridiculously limp lettuce...assume it was dressed and refrigerated earlier in the day...amateur.  Friend oysters were pretty good.  If the rumor that Pearlz is going in to Stonecrest is true, this place can drop \"oyster bar\" from their name and go back to the Cosmos routine.  All very disappointing as we were excited about a new place in the area."}
{"text":"Clam chowder was delicious . We are eating here tonight . Seafood nachos were a no go.. They were a recommendation from our server but lacked flavor and the seafood was lacking. Grilled oysters were a thumbs up from my husband and the steamed clams were also very good ."}
{"text":"So we decided to try Lure. Food was bland, waitstaff not attentive......  Sorry to say that we probably won't be LURED back.  Owner's take note."}
{"text":"We were here for restaurant week and the food and service was good.  However, we made reservations and were told that there would be a 45 min wait - defeats the purpose of having a reservation. We ended up getting a table in the bar area and all was fine from that point on. The raw oysters and tune app were good. Our entrees - seabass, tuna steak, and shrimp and grits were good. Would love to have had dessert, but we were rushed to leave because we were seated later than anticipated. 
Our waitress was excellent - recommended drinks and food, all good. She also was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Good food and a good selection is the draw for sure. The staff is friendly and professional.   As expected, the prices are just a tad higher than normal due to the location."}
{"text":"Bar food at best. Worst shrimp n grits I've ever had. Sent the cheese \"fondue\" back because it was just warmed up velveeta cheese. I'm surprised this place is still open."}
{"text":"We went for week day drinks. They have drinks and food special on week day night.
\" It was Wednesday started with house special oyster with martini.The taste was awesome!!. It's .25$ special so we tried steam and raw one both are taste yummy and had couple special martinis\"
The place is  located in shopping complex and very crowded and staff is really helpful.
\"Please make a reservation before you go other wise you see long waiting line\""}
{"text":"We ate there Friday night. This was our second trip, the first was Valentine's Day. Our first time the food was good as was the service, but did not seem like a place we would rush back to. Friday's dinners sealed the deal, this is a good place to go.

We went Friday at 6:30 pm. The place was fairly empty and that usually is not a good sign.  Our waitress was super, and really did a good job. They had a boil for 32$ or 35$ which had mussels, clams, shrimp, crab legs, and more. The waitress said it was a pound, but when it came it was closer to 4 pounds of seafood and veggies. Flavor was good as was the size. I would be hard pressed to find anything close to the quality and size in Charlotte. 

We had a great meal and the bill was not bad for the quality, size, and service. Give it a try, they are good."}
{"text":"First visit here and will most likely be our last. Place was almost completely empty at 6:30 on a Sunday night. If we weren't so hungry we would have went somewhere else. Food wasn't terrible. I had the crab cake sandwich, it was good. Wife had the chicken and she said here was good also. Daughter had the bbq pizza and hers was \"okay\". Service was great but when you have a seafood restaurant it makes customers uneasy when you don't see enough customers to make you feel good about ordering seafood. I was actually nervous about ordering, and I actually wanted oysters."}
{"text":"Love Wednesdays for 50 cent oysters!  The food itself here is not that amusing to me.  The oysters on the other hand are fair in size and perfect in value on Wednesdays.  Would definitely come here only on Wednesdays for oysters."}
{"text":"I'm giving Lure two stars because it was our lovely server's first day there and she acted like an old pro! Her name was \"Destiny\", and she kept going to the kitchen to get answers regarding what we were thinking of ordering. She also came by to see how we liked our entrees and asked some specific questions like \"was their blend of cheeses on my custom pizza good?\" (answer - yes!) as well as was my husband's \"Turkey Manhattan\" sandwich good (no it wasn't - the bread was NOT sourdough as described, the kitchen told our server that it was real turkey roasted at The Bradshaw House, not deli turkey. It was also served CLOSED, not Open Face as described. And the kitchen poured the gravy on TOP of the sandwich. . . 
REALLY? My husband had a few bites, some of my pizza and we wrapped up the turkey for our dog. He also called the manager this morning (a woman, he didn't catch her name). I believe they had a nice conversation, she was pleased to hear how happy we were with Destiny as our server and also agreed the sandwich was all wrong and would be coming off the menu. That said, she didn't even offer any sort of recompense which a good restauranteur  would have done. No plans to go back."}
{"text":"This place is more of a sports bar that serves oysters. The oysters were good but the rest of the food was sub par. Server, Nick?, was really great especially given we just walked in with a group of 10 and sent back two of our dishes. Definitely go for a few drinks (great prices) and oysters while watching a game, and that's about it."}
{"text":"Thursday-All you can eat crablegs!!! Yes Please!!!!! $25 A fantastic deal!!!! Apparently this place use to be Cosmos....nevr knew. Parking sucks, be prepared to ride with a friend to limit your wait time for parking. I arrived at 6PM, no wait time for a table. 

I started with the gumbo which was DELISH!!!! A small bowl will fill you up....Considering I'm a total foodie, I also ordered the Crab Leg Special...So theres \"no\" added seasoning, which I didn't mind. They also give you two sides and a small cup of butter for your Crab legs.....personally I like a large bowl...i'm such a pig lol.  The staff came to our table at a timely fashion to refill our plates....they give you 2 clusters each refill....this works PERFECT considering things can get messy....empty shells, paper towls."}
{"text":"Good oysters, cold drinks and great service. Makes for a wonderful date night or a day out with friends"}
{"text":"Meh..is right,
We were craving seafood and lobster rolls, so as a good yelper would do, searched for the opinion of my fellow local yelpers.Well.... lets start with the positive, the Oysters were fresh, we ordered half RI and half Canadian oysters and were pretty good,(pricey $24 for 12)
Now,maybe lobster rolls from new england are just too superb that I can't find anything that tastes as fresh and as good as the ones from up north, forgive me if I'm being too critical, I'm just providing my honest opinion.
 Lure's lobster rolls were a little fishy for my taste, they had cucumber instead of celery and no mayo, the fries were crisp and super fried, and came along with a house blue cheese side that could use a little more consistency, it was too watery, I had to ask the waiter what it was once he told me a realized ahh yes blue cheese. My 13 year old ordered a burger and said it was pretty good, and looked like it was cooked to his liking. 
Service was ok, the atmosphere was ok, it looks like they renovated the place a little from the previous Cosmos, they still have a DJ on the weekends.not sure I would dine there again, if I go back I would just stay in the oyster bar for a drink and fresh oysters."}
{"text":"Loved the inside and the atmosphere! Our waiter was so nice and accommodating, didn't catch his name but we had a fairly big group and unfortunately had him running back and forth between the bar and the kitchen all night and he didn't skip a beat. The oysters we had were awesome! Would definitely order them again. The crab fondue.... NOT a big pot of assorted artesian cheeses melting over a flame like everybody was apparently expecting, but for $9 .. why were you expecting that? Wasn't surprised when a plate of chips and some melted Velveeta cheese in a bowl came out. It's edible, definitely not a crowd favorite, and probably won't order again. The Buffalo shrimp was good. Don't get a quesadilla at a seafood restaurant you won't be impressed. I ordered the Shrimp and grits and they were delicious. Totally not what I was expecting (should have read the menu in depth but shrimp and grits are kind of the same wherever ya go) but delicious. Grits were cooked well and sitting at the bottom of the bowl and instead of a creamy soup like bisque with shrimp on top like I'm used to, there was a Cajun jambalaya on top. So, they need to change the names of their dishes to crab Velveeta dip and Charelston style shrimp and grits! Lastly, my boyfriend got the farmhouse chicken and it was VERY good. Chicken over thick pieces of bacon all with a nice BBQ sauce sittin on top of mashed potatoes, yum. Wine selection didn't disappoint either. The outside area looks nice, we will be back and probably sit out there. Oh and parking is an absolute nightmare in that little restaurant area but what's new."}
{"text":"I am perplexed.. I want to give a decent rating however I wasn't dazzled. Our server Claudia was awesome.. So I guess Lure will get a 3 star for her service. She was friendly and attentive.
The food... Again wasn't wowed! My oysters had shells in most of them showing the skills of the chef is flawed for an oyster bar.. May need to take another culinary course for that. 
The crab fondue... Eh... Didn't taste any crab at all. 
Grilled Salmon alone was great.. The sides were not up to par. 
I've been dying to have the Lure experience.. I'm very disappointed! 
If it wasn't for Claudia, my visit would've been brief..again her service was impeccable; just wish the food was.. Thanks Claudia!"}
{"text":"Came here for girls night on a weekend. The restaurant is larger than expected. Bar is right in the middle of the restaurant which is nice. There was a dj there at the time. The bartenders were nice and friendly. Drinks were good. My friends got a appetizer dip to munch on. They all loved it but I was not crazy about it. It was very salty. I couldn't even finish my bite. The dj was playing good music. There is a good mix of people here. I will have to try the oysters one day."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my dads birthday. The food was decent as well as the service. Our servers name was Jennifer. They had live entertainment that was pretty good. Had a good time!!"}
{"text":"Lure Sunday Brunch has become a staple for my family after church. We typically have a fantastic time as well as service. Today we decided to go again for my birthday and we had a completely different experience. I don't blame our server Destini for being overwhelmed as she had a large party of 13 and 4 other tables of 4-5 patrons each. During the busiest portion of the brunch rush we ended up being forgotten with no beverages, table not cleared. After waiting 20 minutes I requested assistance of Barbara the manager since it was clear staffing was an issue. 

Suddenly everyone was attentive for 10 minutes. The. The slow service continued. French toast took 30 minutes to come to the table long after the pancakes and waffle we ordered were delivered and eaten. Destini worked to get our group a discount due to the continued delays. We received a 10% discount off 1 buffet. A whopping $1.70. 

I'm a pretty fair minded patron. I understand being busy. Clearly customer service is not a prior of Barbara or the owners of this establishment. I wont continue to recommend this place to others as I've done previously. I am soooo disappointed and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped by last week and the place is closed. Sign sends people to Bradshaws in the same center"}
{"text":"I had to do a re-review simply because my experience today was so off putting and drastically different from my first visits.

Lure when it opened had great oysters and really great seafood dishes. Great service & great ambiance.  Not sure if times got hard - but they are totally different for the worst ways. They have a new menu with barely any seafood. They have on the menu that they are a \"pub\" now.  No wide selection of oysters to choose from. The house oysters were small ..I mean really small.  Had all types of grit in them. Most of the food was pub/bar food..sandwiches, burgers, wings, random apps.

The service was slow and there wasn't anything awesome anymore.  I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Will not go back! Was really looking forward to dining here and highly disappointed! Service was average...considering it was 5 in the evening and it was very slow, I feel below average.  Oysters were average and way over priced! The salad was basically lettuce pulled from a bag, thrown on a plate a few tomatoes thrown on, pickled nasty carrots and dressing that was \"homemade\"...several pieces of the lettuce was wilted and probably one of the worst salads I've eaten! The co2 on draught was out (Prob still is) and bartender ignored it as he watched his football game with his arms crossed most of the time! Watch numerous beers brought back by waitresses, he finally samples it and still served it KNOWING IT WAS FLAT! He just didn't care!  Finally got a glass of wine which was a waste! The pour was pitiful for $9.00!  Pour was under half of the glass and I'm referring to a SMALL chardonnay glass...hubby wanted me tom say something but just wanted to get the  hell out of there! Heard pearlz oyster bar is opening at stonecrest and if true, Lure will not make it! Never again!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now, and it is not getting any better than the first visit soon after opening - no oysters available. Really? The food is okay, the service is slow, and they just changed the rules on oysters on Saturday afternoon 1/2 price appetizers. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"How? How is this place still open? From hostess to wait staff to the food, nothing was even decent. I promised to stop writing bad reviews unless it was really really bad, so here I am. I'm pretty sure this place is going under they're just not letting anybody know, at least that's how every single employee at that place acts. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I only go to Lure on the weekends (now only Saturdays) since it is one of the only dance spots in Ballantyne with a DJ. We have never eaten here, only gotten drinks here so my review can only be for that and the atmosphere. Up until last night, I would have given the drinks/bartender 5 stars because we connected with an amazing bartender who knew his drinks, his pours, and his customers. We sadly found out last night he was no longer there, and our experience went down a notch with our drinks. For example, my Mojito was made with basil=yuck :( The crowd on a Saturday night for dancing is fun. Crowded but not overwhelming, and a good mix of ages, but usually not anyone under 25. They get DJs that play a variety of genres of music and there's plenty of dance room. Only negative is the constant fish smell... But it is an oyster bar after all. Maybe one night we'll try the food but for now we stick to the drinks and dancing."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in today's oysters. Maybe I didn't notice as much earlier because I was blinded by the cheap cost, but here were my problems. 

The oysters were not cleaned well. Even when I held one my hands got so dirty. I ended up getting a lot of shell so that was pretty annoying. The oysters were also very salty and very watery. To top it off, majority were so small today!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have had in a long time! We went on a Friday night  it was restaurant week but we were going out for my BFF bday.. And it was pretty much empty. That should have been the first indication it was going to be a bad night! We had a party of ten and we ordered drinks and appetizers and that took about 30 min our main entree took another 1 hr. In between time the waitress did not offer refills we had to get up and ask for some. One person in our party was charged triple the amount of his check on his card the next day. For it to be an oyster bar the oysters look as if they were hand selected from a grocery store. I would not recommend this place to anyone the food is mediocre. The service is horrible and the staff is even worse as when we complained no one offers any compensation for anything. We asked for a manager someone name 'Mich' he never appeared and was told the head chef was in charges and he did nothing either. I don't know what kind of business is being ran there but if it continues it will not be there long."}
{"text":"I have never been here for oysters, which is why I have put off this review, but still have not got around to it, so will review it based on the bar.  I came here one weekend evening and sat at the bar.  The bar is huge and has ample seating for many people.  It is a very spacious restaurant that doubles as a dance floor later in the evening, with a DJ.

The service was good.  The oyster shots were definitely pretty delicious.  I would like to come back some time to taste the oysters or maybe some of the dinner options."}
{"text":"I heard mixed reviews about Lure. We decided to try it out yesterday. This place has a great atmosphere. The food was delicious and service was great. I dont have anything negative to say."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for an opportunity to try this place.  I'm a big fan of the owner's other restaurants and bars.  I enjoyed the chowder and the hush puppy fried oysters.  They were great!  The oysters Rockefeller were ok but could use some work.  The decor is great and the service was top notch.  I will be back to try other menu items for sure."}
{"text":"Nah, won't be going back. This place went downhill fast! They got really cheap with the crab cocktail, seafood tastes fishy, not fresh.There's a difference. I'm done~"}
{"text":"Ok it gets 3 stars solely because of service and ambiance, otherwise it would be a 4. Ill break it down:

Ambiance: Noisy as all heck. No sound buffer, you really cant hold a conversation in this place if its packed. I mean its loud, the loudest rest. that I can remember in a long time. This is going to be an issue for them. 

Service: Was pretty bad at the beginning but worked out towards the end. People were friendly. We were seated and it took a good 20 minutes before we got our drinks. Ordered a couple of martinis on the rocks and I could see the bartender was going to pour them in a regular martini glass with ice in it? Really? Anyway thank god a QC guy was at the bar because he gave her a big no no. Once the drink issue was over the service was spot on. Although I have to say we were ready to get up and leave because of the noise and waiting so long to get drinks in our hands.

Food: Oysters were good and my food and wife's food was good. Had the oyster mix. yummy! The fired oyster with vegetable substitutes was great. 

If your thinking of going just know that the service isn't were needs to be yet. My guess is they are working on it. The Bar is a little slow, looks like they are training both bartenders and waiters as everyone had a shadow. The food is great so you will have a good meal but be prepared for the NOISE level. Don't go expecting not to yell during dinner."}
{"text":"We've only been on Wednesday nights, and probably the main night that we'll go (half priced oysters and some specialty drinks). The Shrimp and Grits were good (not the best, but good - I thought the gravy was a little spicy). But you can't beat the deal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now hoping the experience will be better every time I come. I just came here for some quick take out and I asked the hostess where should I go for takeout and she had no clue. At the very least she could've directed me to the bar. Seems very simple

I just got fish tacos today and they were very below average. This also had no flavor and the pineapple seemed old.

I came here previously with my wife and we were both very disappointed with both the food and the service. I think that will be my last time going. I'm always in search of some good seafood which is very hard to find in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Went last week for all you can eat crab legs. Crab was not fresh at all. Every time I asked for another round, they got smaller and smaller. They never brought out more butter and really took their time between rounds. And their drinks are 8+ dollars a pop. Come on, this is Ballantyne not Manhattan."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are bad reviews for this place food was yummy and our server was awesome !"}
{"text":"Called in a take out order...
\"Hello?\"
\"Uh, hello, is this Lure...\"
\"yes mmhmm!, can I help you\"
\"yes, I'd like to place an order for pick up...\"
\"ok hang on,\"
Phone down, talking in the back ground... 2 minutes, 3, 4, - I hang up call back.

\"Hello?\"
\"Uh, hello, is this Lure...\"
\"yes mmhmm!, can I help you\"
\"yes, I just called a minute ago, we must have been disconnected, I'd like to place an order for pick up...\"
\"ok, hang on\"...

So I was able to eventually order, been meaning to check this place out as we've visited the other restaurants and shops in this little outcove several times previously.  They basically moved into Cosmos, forgot to clean it out and update the decor, and fired up the friers to see what the Cosmos folks left behind that they could cook up and upsell to the yuppy crowd.

Wife goes in to pick it up, comes back out and explains how the hostess asked if she could take my wife's credit card to the bar to pick up her food for her.  Can't I just walk the 5 feet over to the bar and pay for it myself, my wife asked, and executed on.

I ordered a staple at any place calling themselves an \"oyster bar\" - the fish and chips.  This can be a show stopper if done properly, but oy vay was it off target.  The fish itself seemed to be in great shape, actually.  The Cod was light and flaky, and I bet would have tasted great had it been fried and cooked properly.

The batter was just embarrassing.  Tasted like it has been recycled from the night before, and looked grey and unappetizing.  The fries were soggy and nasty, although you have to give a bit of a pass on the fries for any \"takeout\" dining experience.

Overall just supremely disappointing experience, and the end results were not pretty when my stomach and mouth went to war over whether or not to keep the food down."}
{"text":"Food was NOT good.  We ordered oysters Rockefeller - it took forever and it was terrible.  Even the crackers were stale! The \"chefs rice\" as a side was uber plain with no flavor.  The salmon was decent but very  plain. The onion rings were soggy and straight from plastic bag.
Husband had the  Jamba and blah.  It's a shame too as the location is great but the emphasis on the food/menu is the pits. It was a disappointment from the time we walked in.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Do not go there on a Friday night. Out of control. Service bad. Bartenders will not shut off drunks."}
{"text":"Food was great and it's always a plus that they are kid friendly. We went with 4 adults and 4 kids ranging from 22 months to 6 yrs and we had no problems at all."}
