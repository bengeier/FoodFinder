{"text":"Cute family-owned little place with a rustic/industrial ambience. Got the fried buttermilk chicken which was served over a brioche bun. Felt like chicken was a little on the salty side, but the cole slaw added a nice crunch and some acidity."}
{"text":"A great addition to the area- Lox, Stock, and Brisket is a fresh take on deli food. I had a nice chat with the staff and owner and found out they make most everything in-house, even the smoked fish, Lox, and pickles. I had the brisket Ruben and the sandwich had a nice smoky taste without being overpowering. The sandwich was a perfect size and the accompanying potato salad was delicious. The Matzo Ball soup had a very well-flavored broth with a good mix of veggies and two decent (but not huge) sized firm, but tender matzo balls.   While not a huge space, there is  enough comfortable seating inside for small groups and large families. The biggest issue might be parking in front, but there is a wealth of space next to, across, and behind the deli."}
{"text":"Yum!! Just had lunch here. I got the Lincoln Park and was really happy with my choice.  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful! The veggies on the sandwich and in the coleslaw were fresh and crisp and delicious.  Highly recommend.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Tempting? The buttermilk chicken is crunchy and tasty. I ordered Lincoln Park and it's so good. Worth for the price."}
{"text":"I decided to try LOX STOCK AND BRISKET without knowing much about it other than its unusual name.  It was well-worth  the visit.  I left happy and satisfied!  The place is small, cool and very accessible.  It feels like an old neighborhood place and you get a warm, welcoming greeting, even on your first visit.  The menu is small, but very inclusive of deli favorites with a GREAT CHEF twists,  They take food seriously here, unlike some of the bigger, more well-known delis in this one-time Jewish deli neighborhood.  I usually avoid these delis because of their heavy hand with the sodium content in their food.  And food is often served with no pride, slapped down on the table.  That was not a problem here,  The brisket sandwich I had was rich in taste and pleasing in presentation. Lightly marinated cucumber slices on the sandwich and a garlicky pickle spear on the side were very appealing for me.  Anthony, the owner, is a very knowledgeable guy in the food world, having been part of several big-name restaurants in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York.  He is a personable young man who makes the customer feel at home and well-fed.  His mother makes the cheesecake, which I will go back for very soon.  I'll wait to try the Matzoh Ball soup when it's less that 90 degrees outside, but I have the feeling it's delicious!  It's a convenient place to get to, parking was easy and the ambiance was comfortable.  Its a great place to duck into for a wonderful sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great deli I've been looking for a replacement since Cleveland Pickle closed and this place is awesome! Fresh food cool people and just a great spot - glad it's on the east side!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Familiar dishes with an upscale gourmet twist. Cool owner that appreciates the culinary craft and meal quality. Nice decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hubba, hubba.  I was in need of comfort and enjoyable sustenance yesterday afternoon and found both in spades at Lox, Stock and Brisket.  The Lincoln Park sandwich is perfectly browned, crispy outside, tender and tasty buttermilk chicken schnitzel with house-made bread-and-butter pickles and slaw and a hot sauce aioli on a challah-type bun (from Unger's if I remember correctly).   The potato salad is a religious experience with potatoes not cooked so long that they break into mush yet tender enough to literally melt when you take a bite. They are dressed with sour cream, a touch of house-made mayo with a bit of super fine celery seed (just enough so you know it's celery seed if you really think on it but not so much that it's in your face celery seed) and I'm not sure what else but it is heavenly. That potato salad gave me more comfort yesterday than a snuggle with a sweet puppy could. I mean, it's magic.  I also got to try the coleslaw (the one served as a side which is different than the slaw on the Lincoln Park sandwich). It's a winner of a slaw that's perfectly, lightly dressed and tossed with a pinch of caraway seed that brings something really nice to the party.  The side pickle is one of the few things not made in-house and they lose no points for that. It's from a Cincinnati company (Kaiser?) and is kind of a sour version of Sheckler's Candied Orange spears. I'm pretty sure there's a touch of clove in the pickling spice. It's a delight of a pickle and fits in perfectly with all the flavors going on with what I had on my plate yesterday.  Chef Anthony Zappola's mod-deli is one of the most fun and satisfying places I've come across in a long time. After just one meal I put it up there with Plum as a new Cleveland favorite.  If you're lucky, Chef Anthony's mom will be working the counter when you visit. You'll be able to tell she's chef's mom from her genuine and heart-felt enthusiasm in talking about the menu and how things are prepared and in her most congenial demeanor.  I consider it lucky when food satisfies as much as my meal at Lox Stock and Brisket did yesterday, when it's not just satisfying or super enjoyable food but when the whole experiences nourishes your soul in addition to your belly.  We are SO lucky to have them here in The CLE. I'm eager to make my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! We had such a nice experience here, both service-wise and food wise! First the food: perfectly cooked and sliced brisket, high quality rye bread, fresh smoked turkey, great slaw and potato salad. For the kids: a burger they shared and devoured and a nice egg & cheese sandwich. And the service: very thoughtful about what the kids could eat and the chef took the time to show the kids what he was cooking for them through the window. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple and has something for everyone.  The atmosphere is great and not overwhelming with too much clutter.  I got my order to go, fast service for a sit down restaurant.  Everything I got was fine. Nothing that special about the way my meal was prepared but not bad either.  Great service and staff and I'm sure I'll be back to try out some more items in the menu.   I had the Santa Monica, good portion sizes."}
{"text":"WOW!  This was my first visit and most definitely, not my last. Lox, Stock and Brisket had been on my short list of places to try, since opening.  I finally got an opportunity to visit, this past weekend, and I was not at all disappointed.  I ordered the sandwich that my fellow Yelpers have been raving about, and it was DELICIOUS!  Prior to my visit to Lox, Stock and Brisket, my favorite chicken sandwich was at Boxcar Betty's in Charleston SC.  The Lincoln Park at this restaurant is now, hands down, my favorite....it was SOOOO good!  Hot crispy chicken breast, homemade slaw, sweet pickles on a fresh bun.  I could taste each element on the sandwich. The slaw was coarsely grated,  lightly dressed and perfectly seasoned.  My sandwich was accompanied by house made pickle spears and potato salad.  The pickle spears were tangy, and different from the pickles on the sandwich.  The potato salad was not the traditional stuff you find in the grocery store deli.  This salad was homemade with red skinned potatoes, lightly smashed, seasoned nicely.  I'm usually not a big potato salad fan, but this version was delicious. The staff was super-friendly and very patient with those that had questions about the menu.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Hurry, don't dally to a great new deli serving brisket like gramma makes. NOT bbq, but old fashioned braised brisket. Melts in ur mouth. Homemade lox n smoked fish spread are to die for! Fresh and tasty crisp garlic dill pickles. Awesome coleslaw with a caraway kick and potato salad to add to ur sandwich. Casual environment bring the family."}
{"text":"I got the Buttermilk Chicken Schnitzel, bread & butter pickle slaw, hot sauce aioli, on a Kaiser roll.  It was fantastic. Definitely will be back. I just wish they were open later than 7pm, as that's a popular time for dinner."}
{"text":"I got takeout from Lox, Stock and Brisket today and I have to admit, they do a very nice job with customer service, food, and a plain but pleasant atmosphere. Parking can be a bit challenging, it I believe there is additional parking in back of the restaurant. I just needed a quick bite before a meeting, so I got a half of the big salad, and the Lox tray. The Lox were delicious and the salad came with a very simple beet very red wine vinaigrette. The Lox tray came as it should with sliced red onion, capers, cream cheese (and saltine crackers, kind of a bummer). As another Yelper suggested, stop by Bialy's and grab a bagel. They just around the corner on Warrensville Center. I'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Really nice Briskett sandwich.  Not too fatty, good flavor and crunch.  I got the Matzo Ball soup.  Decent flavor needed some more salt and was lukewarm.  Overall I like this place and will be back to try some of their other selections."}
{"text":"Great food! You get your moneys worth for sure! Best cheesecake ever!!!! Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went to try Lox, Stock and Brieket the other day having realized it was new to the area. I choose their #9 which is a bagel, lox and cream cheese. I was surprised at how much I disliked this particular bagel and lox as it is typically my favorite and not a difficult meal to make delicious. The seating area is small but full of creative decorating. There were several others customers trying out this new spot but it isn't one I'll go back to."}
{"text":"Great Place. Super friendly. I came in after the restaurant closed and they served me right away. I got a turkey sandwich to go  and it was delicious. I will be back and definitely recommend this restaurant to others. It's not your average deli...TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Anthony, his mom and his sister are awesome!  I've become a huge fan of his brisket, white BBQ sauce and his hand shredded cole slaw.  If you enjoy good smoked brisket or turkey, I highly recommend you giving this hidden gem a shot.  Don't forget to bring the kids, because they will be sure to make a Jr. sized sandwich for any little appetite.  Can't wait for my next few pounds of meat!"}
{"text":"This is likely the 10 th or so times we have had this , I have tried ecerything so far , and with out fail everything I have tried was  Stellar ! I wanted to specifically comment on the great Tuna salad sandwich . generous portion , deliciousness roll , onion and tomato with a side of potato salad . Hit the spot ! Was delicious and filling .Also  Best Potato salad in town !!!!!!!!!!  As always we are going to be back David"}
{"text":"Talk about delicious foods!!  We visited here the other night and are hooked. Their Lincoln park is amazing! I also had for the first time matzaball soup. It was amazing and to be honest, you can tell its a mommas recipe.   The golden fried chicken on the sandwich was perfect. Then throw on some slaw that added a nice sweetness to it and the sauce had a little bite. All served on a warm bun.   The potato salad was light and airy and didn't have any unnecessary spices. It was perfect!  The atmosphere was fun and people laughed and talked to one another. It was a fantastic meal. I'd highly recommend you stop by for a sandwich and get ready to have a party on your taste buds."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great concept: hipster meets Jewish deli. The food is definitely delicious, but seems to be lacking one thing or other. I have been to this location twice, once I had the Boco, and once a friend and I had the #1 and #3 options. The Boco was delicious, but the bagel slightly too chewy. The #1 was great, but my boyfriend and I both agreed that the brisket was a bit chewier than expected. The #3 chicken schnitzel was perfect. Would recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"Really excellent! Nice blend of new and cool with a friendly family run neighborhood business. Chicken sandwich was definitely a hit, but don't sleep on the brisket - so juicy and flavorful. Cole slaw and potato salad excellent. Friendly and welcoming service. Reasonably priced. Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since I heard about it. It is quite simply, amazing. Harmonious flavors across the board. Friendly staff. This should be on your list for dining."}
{"text":"the best QUALITY deli style fare ive had.....anywhere....reuben cole slaw matzoh ball soup....superbly executed"}
{"text":"Really good lunch spot!  The Lincoln park was delicious... and the ingredients were fresh. I will definitely go back to try another sandwich."}
{"text":"Ordered their Lox Sandwich, aka the Ridge Lane. I like the effort that the proprietors go to in smoking their own salmon. However, I was hoping for a more NY style lox bagel sandwich that typically consists of a nice bagel (this was a bit doughy), a shmear of cream cheese (this was thinner), capers, red onion and maybe a tomato slice. The salmon wasn't as smoked as I would have hoped but I appreciate the quality of the fish that was used. Perhaps this was a different rendition of a NY classic, but I look forward to trying their other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great place for deli sandwiches. I stopped by to pick up dinner and then some extra stuff for lunches. Flavors did not disappoint!  I got the Boro and the hubby got The Mirage (tuna sandwich). Both were tasty. We ended up getting 2 orders of matzoh ball soup, and a  pound of brisket for our lunches/dinners this week.  We will definitely come back to try other sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"Lox, Stock and Brisket had a soft opening two days ago and is already off to a fantastic start. When my husband and I went in, the chef was super friendly and more than willing to make suggestions. House cured and smoked, thick cut, juicy brisket is the real star here!  I ordered a #1 ($11) without bread (FYI- they will be adding gluten free wraps/bread in the near future), which came with brisket, mustard and delicious house-made dill cucumber (quick pickles). These and the spears they serve on the side are NOT sweet- Yay! The potato salad accompaniment might be the best I've ever had in a restaurant. My husband had a #10 ($8) without cheese and really enjoyed the egg/brisket combo on a bagel. Their bagels come from Unger's, over on Taylor Rd. Aside from the food being delicious, we really appreciated the inclusion of local ingredients in a few of the items on the menu.   Clevelanders are loyal to their delis and we certainly have the best ones already located on the east side, so it will be interesting to see how business goes for this new addition to the mix. I would say that the quality of ingredients here and attention to preparation is much higher than other options in the area, so Lox, Stock and Brisket isn't just another same old Jewish deli. Can't wait to go back and try their turkey Rueben next!"}
{"text":"Great flavored Brisket , almost like pastrami. The schnitzel sandwich was juicy and tangy. My only suggestion is to step up the bagel game. The bagel itself was boring and flavorless, what was onside was great. Bialys Bagels is right around the corner, I'm sure they would love to work with y'all"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the neighborhood. The food was delicious, especially the check in sandwich!  This is a family owned business that deserves our patronage! Looking forward to going back and trying something else!"}
{"text":"Solid brisket sandwich. A little skimpy on the potato salad side but overall really tasty and definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"I've been there twice so far. During the first visit I ordered the matzo ball soup, Santa Monica and the potato salad. I love the matzo ball soup. It's not just broth. There are chunks of carrot, celery and moist chicken in it. The smoked turkey on the sandwich was moist, the BBQ sauce and mustard were not too heavy. I absolutely loved the potato salad. It is a red skin potato salad and is perfectly creamy. On my second visit (the very next today) I went back to try the brisket. I am not a fan of corned beef because it's too salty and fatty in my opinion. The \"Rueben\" uses smoked brisket, and it is now my favorite Reuben ever. The brisket is served in thick chunks of flavorful meat - not too fatty or salty. The Russian dressing and kraut on a nice rye bread were just right. I wasn't as enthused with the cole slaw, but it was good. But I prefer a very creamy cole slaw, so my choice is subjective based on my tastes. The service was great. They definitely made me feel welcome. I see myself becoming a regular with quality - and matzo ball soup - this good."}
{"text":"What a great new spot! Right around the corner from me so I was eager to check this place out. We had the chicken schnitzel sandwich which I LOVED and a build your own brisket sandwich. The meat on both was very, very flavorful and juicy. I also really liked the potato salad that comes on the side. A new, must try place!"}
