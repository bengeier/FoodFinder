{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood spot!! Great service and so much to choose from on the menu.  

Nothing can beat a truly cold beer and a mac 'n cheese burger.  Sounds weird, I know.... but definitely exceeded my expectations!! It is a MUST TRY!!! Friendly staff and just an overall nice place to relax and grab a bite to eat.  Can't wait to go back.... and will definitely become a \"regular\"."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half past the time we ordered for only 4 entrees, two of which were sandwiches. Told the waitress we needed to leave so to bring us our food boxed up, took an additional 30 minutes for the boxing up."}
{"text":"I went here around the Christmas holiday this past December, and I am only getting around to reviewing this place because my experience that winter evening was utterly forgettable.

I'm not going to go into some long drawn out review of this place.  I'll just say, Friar Tuck's served me the worse wings I've ever had in Charlotte.  I concur with what a previous reviewer said about the wings.  They had zip, zero, no, sauce at all!  Most wings are either breaded or naked.  If they are naked, then they MUST HAVE SAUCE - hot, buffalo, bbq, cajun, garlic, etc!  No QUESTIONS ASKED!  It's like they had no concept of what a wing sauce was. I didn't get anything else.  I didn't want anything else after tasting the wings.

I gave this place 2 stars because the bartender was excellent despite the food.  He was quick to ask if I needed a fresh beer when my current one was low.  In addition, they also have an unique beer selection.  They also have a few flat screens with the games on as well.

All in all, despite the fact that I live within walking distance from Friar Tuck, I'm not likely to return.  This place might be better off if they didn't serve food at all, and just stuck to the booze.  Even though I try to support the local businesses and establishments in and around Charlotte, I won't be back.  Why?  In short, because THIS local establishment didn't support THIS local customer."}
{"text":"Four stars so this \"review\" stays at the top : read Laura's warning!

this place is gone and the yelp deal is worth .... $0"}
{"text":"I hope they fixed their wings since the last time I was there; it was unseasoned, un-sauced, small pieces of un-breaded fried chicken. 

As for the club sandwich, it was basic ham & turkey with undercooked bacon on un-toasted bread, served with American Cheese, which don't even get me started on American Cheese..... 

Notice how everything was \"under-done\"....That's why you get a bad review, because you're lazy about preparation. Try toasting the bread, saucing the wings, having varieties of sauces, create your own sauce, pepper the bacon, etc. 

Its a tough business, if you cut corners, your food will suck and you'll get called out. 

Having a bar isn't just about having good beer.

***EDIT: 

Okay, Okay....I bumped my review up to 2 stars, because---yes, the beer was tasty and cold, and service was pretty good....

Maybe I might try it again, but the scrutiny that I've gotten from management regarding this review has been unreal, so probably not."}
{"text":"CLOSED.  Do not buy the deal, and do not waste your gas to try to come.  It's been closed for MONTHS, and signs say it will soon be an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I so badly want to like this place as it is not even a mile from my house but they make it so hard...I hardly ever see anyone in there and now I know why!

I went there last night for some drinks with a few friends and as a person in the service industry, was astounded at the terrible service the two bartenders/waitresses gave. Not only were they chumming around with the regulars, I actually had to wait to pay for my tab while they took Patron shots with customers. Also, even though I was drinking beer, I had a cup of water as well and I had to continuously go up to the bar and ask for more water. Not ONE time did they come over to ME and give me more water. Terrible terrible terrible awful. Surprised this place is still open!"}
{"text":"Great little place conveniently located 3 minutes from my home.  :)  Been here 2 times since it opened a few months ago and I have been pleasantly surprised by the meals.
On my first visit I had the BBQ chicken with mac n' cheese and veggie skewers and i was not expecting what I got.  Chicken was super juicy, well cooked, not dry.  Mac n' cheese were creamy and delicious (no boxed mac n' cheese here).  And the veggie skewers were fresh and well seasoned.
On my second visit I had the fried pickles for appetizer.  These were thicker sliced and lightly breaded, piping hot and surprisingly mild in flavor.  Just right!
I also had the portabella mushroom sandwich.  It was different.  I was expecting a huge grilled portabella mushroom as I've had at other places but this sandwich had a ton of grilled baby bellas smothered in provolone cheese with roasted red bell peppers and sweet caramelized onions.  It was very good!  And HUGE!  I could only eat half of it.  The fries were also good.
Overall a pleasant experience on both visits.
The menu is kinda small and there are no desserts.  I hope they expand on it.  But the beer selection is ample."}
{"text":"Great little local hang out place, but doesn't really have the bells and whistles that everyone probably expects from a \"sports bar\" type place.   Friar Tuck Pub had some big shoes to fill after Tijuana Flats left.  I think the space sat empty for the longest time so it was good to see something else move in.

Bar in the middle... tables scattered around.  Pool table in the back.  Some couches and lounge type furniture towards the front.  There is a patio set up which is nice as well.

The barkeep was super friendly and you can tell he was the only one there (on a Thursday night) so he was running around a good bit.  Definitely kept coming by to make sure we had full beers in hand.

There is a juke box that provides the music for the place, but that could potentially be a buzz kill depending on the \"DJ\" for the night.  As a wise friend once put it, \"It only takes one person to ruin the night for everyone.\"  Don't get me wrong, but the idea of being able to choose the music is nice on paper.... execution can be a little tricky depending on who is there and what type of music is selected.

I can see the potential, but for now... I will just leave it as a good place to grab a beer after work."}
