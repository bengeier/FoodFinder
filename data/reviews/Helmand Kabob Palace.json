{"text":"Newly opened in a small Pickering strip mall, Helmand Kabob is worth a detour. There is some space for dine-in in this very clean, attractive little restaurant, but I was there for take-out. I phoned in my order in advance, and it was fresh and waiting for me at the expected time.

I had the Chalaw Kabob dinner (including a very fresh side salad and piece of warm naan) and a side of Qabuli. The Chalaw kabob (2 generous pieces) was nicely spiced with just a kick of heat, and the meat was soft but had that smokey grilled flavor. But the rice - tender, fragrant, fluffy, moist without being greasy or sticky - is exactly what I look for but rarely find in Afghan rice. The Qabuli pullao was even better, and that is saying something! It was warmly spiced, fragrance rather than heat, with fresh-tasting carrot slices and studded with raisins and almonds. Most places skimp on the garnishes, but not at Helmand!

Very friendly, helpful, family-run establishment and I felt comfortable asking questions about the menu. I wish them all the best I will be back soon, particularly for another hit of that Qabuli pulau! If you like Afghan food, I encourage you to give Helmand a try."}
{"text":"I tried this place once and ordered chicken tikka kabob and loved it. A couple weeks later, we had an event and did some catering and decided to order from here. We didn't understand everything on the menu and some of our guests didn't eat beef. They were very very friendly and explained what the items were and did some substitution where necessary. The chicken kabobs were juicy and tasty. First time I had mantoo and it was very good. The rice is good, so is the salad. The tandoori chicken was very different and tasty as well. The bolani and beef kabob was also good. Everyone loved the food and we liked the care they put into making the food and explaining what's what. We will definitely be back, I think some others who tried Helmand for the first time will be as well."}
{"text":"I had a really big craving for Afghan food so I decided to go on over to check this restaurant out. I heard about it from a friend that had a fairly good experience and told me to try it.

It's a very small shop with ok decor but I didn't feel very comfortable with dining in. Looking around it was empty but the tables and floor were not very clean. 

I asked for recommendations but was told they were all very popular so I just decided to go with the Sultani Kabab. The first thing I usually do, and get super excited to do is dig into that fresh delicious in house made naan and dip it in the white sauce. Instead I got a store bought naan (literally the pita you get) not even heated. That was a huge disappointment. 

The meat itself was impossible to chew. I get sultani often but never was it like this. 

Thank goodness I ordered the qabuli rice because it  was actually good.

I may go back and give them another try, maybe it was just an off day."}
