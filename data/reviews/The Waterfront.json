{"text":"The Waterfront has it all!  Great food, amazing patio and views and incredible service. The owners and staff make you feel right at home and the menu offers something for everyone. Relax on the beautiful patio with sweeping vistas of the marina and Lake Ontario or enjoy a five star meal in the fine dining room, you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy cocktails and great food and entertainment on the first level or throw a party in the amazing upstairs banquet room catered to your tastes and needs. You won't find better food or service in Durham, its been our favourite destination for years and one you will find yourself coming back to time and time again!"}
{"text":"this is worst meal I had during my visit in Toronto.  There were only 5 tables of customers on a Friday evening. Our waiter was un-interested in providing service.  Oyster was room temperature barely cold and fish was not seasoned at all also the boiled vegetable.   My friend's scallops was over cooked, tasted like rubber and couscous has no flavor what so ever.  the best thing in that meal was the garlic bread."}
{"text":"Went here on a cold December night. Couldn't really appreciate the view of the lake. Quite surprised with the quality of food and service after reading all the former reviews. All food came out hot and the service was quick.

IMO, the food is like the Keg, but cheaper and larger portions...for some items. What I like are the fries, the way I like them. Hot, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I got the waterfront burger. It did not blow my mind, but it was extremely juicy. My friend got the prime rib. Huge portions of meat and potatoes, enough for 2 people.

I would return if I was hungry for this type of bistro food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch.  Our server,  Debbie, was extremely friendly and welcoming. The Western omelette, French toast and Eggs Benny were delicious though we found that the menu was short of options. The setting was fabulous, placed near a boardwalk which is perfect for a stroll after your meal. Along the boardwalk by the beach is a water park and playground. All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant in hopes that you have as pleasant an experience as I did."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice restaurant by the lake? Head east to Pickering and look for the Waterfront Bistro!

This cool bistro is located in Pickering by the Frenchman's Bay. You can enjoy the beautiful view on the patio on the second floor, or hang out and drink with your buddies on the first floor. If you're out on a date, this is a cool place to go. After dinner and drinks, you can walk on the boardwalk by the bay and relax. 

So you've got a really beautiful view of the boats and the bay, and you'll also experience great food and ambience! What I like about the Waterfront is that they have daily specials that consist of a soup and an entree. If you're not up for that, you can check out their daily promos. My faves are Martini Mondays and Wing Night Wednesdays -  awesome wings for just 50cents each!! They are so good and yummy-to-the-bones! ;-) It's my favorite hang out on Wednesdays.

And to top it all, they have live entertainment on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for close to 5 years. My favorite is their half priced mussel Mondays - curry flavoured! They've always been known for their great service, cozy vibe and delicious food. Over the past few months, I've noticed that at least one person in my group has had a plate of mediocre food or funky mussels. Last night, when the server brought over my mussels, the whole table noticed the foul smell. I couldn't even get myself to try one. The server completely discounted my concerns, and although she was polite and offered to replace or bring me something else, she didn't think anything was wrong and refused to smell it herself. Her response was that she served hundreds of mussels and no one has ever complained. The rest of my party ordered other items off the menu and they were pretty mediocre. 

I'm sad to say I'll probably not be returning to Waterfront. The food and service over the past few months has just been too inconsistent and disappointing."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is it's prime waterfront location and excellent view from the patio. They also have a good sized parking lot out front for their customers. 

When we first arrived at the restaurant, what seemed to be 2-3 hostesses/waitresses at the entrance seemed very disorganized and stressed out and kept running in and out of the restaurant and up/down the stairs of the patio to figure out seating. Looking into the restaurant, it was probably ~1/3 full, so not sure how they would manage at full capacity...

We decided to take a seat inside instead of waiting for the patio. The interior was nice. Our waitress was quite pleasant and served us in a timely manner through our whole experience. They seemed to have a lot of staff for the number of patrons that night, and it was really obvious that many of them were standing around trying to look busy. (It shouldn't take 3 people to move a 3x3 table over by a few inches).

The food is really the biggest disappointment though, especially for the price that they charge. Entrees are anywhere from approx $12-$37. 

I ended up ordering a pulled pork sandwich served with a side of sweet potato fries. The presentation was pretty good. But the bun on the sandwich was so soft and limp like it was from a NoFrills Value Pack. The pulled pork didn't have the best taste/texture either (like it was microwaved), and there wasn't anything else inside the sandwich. I basically had to throw the side coleslaw and pickle garnishes inside to make it somewhat better (though it didn't help much). 

The sweet potato fries reminded me of the frozen McCain's ones you can get from the grocery store. Not in a good way.

Brother and dad both had the fish & chips. Potato fries were okay, but they both said their fish was so-so.

Would come back here only for the patio/view/location, and probably drinks. Would definitely help if they put a little more pride and effort into their food though. It would be really nice to see some improvements and better reviews in the future!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times in recent months. The first time my main course was in my opinion not edible but they replaced it at no charge for something that was. The homemade soups tend to always be great. The salmon on the menu was delicious. I was served a huge portion but ate it all because it was that good. Overall, I would go back here in a heartbeat. The location is not as great as Port but the food is better. There is a limited view of the lake since most windows overlook the parking lot. If you go to the second story you have an unobstructed view of Lake Ontario. Many of the tables and chairs are bar height which makes it awkward for anyone who may be mobility challenged like myself."}
{"text":"Im not doing this review justice as I only come here for the awesome mussels! On Monday nights its half price too, so treat yourself to a glass a wine and celebrate Mondays! Not a fan of the marinara sauce, but the white wine is to die for. My bestie always gets the curry sauce. We're regular musselers :)"}
{"text":"Awful.   We arrived around 7 on a Friday evening.    The dining area was packed.   We were seated at a table for 2 in the middle of the floor.   It was like steerage class on the Titanic.....   I could have elbowed the people at the table to my left and right and behind me.   Suffocating and claustrophobic and so incredibly loud.    

The waiter bungled our drinks order.    Then the food.....   $32 for 4 scallops on a bed of plain rice !    I got the bruschetta which was not just not hot, but aggressively cold, as though it had been chilled in the freezer.   I was repulsed.    

We couldn't leave fast enough.    Outside, heading towards the car I turned to my partner and said \"That was f***ing awful !\"    I then overheard a patron who was outside smoking turn to his friend and say: \"Ha!  I guess it's not just us!\"

I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I recently had a Bridal Shower/Brunch at the Waterfront Bistro Dining and Bar.  We had a wonderful day and everything was perfect! The friendlly service was excellent and the food was really good! The room and location is fantastic! It was a complete pleasure doing business with Elaine and The Waterfront Bistro! I highly recommend The Waterfront Bistro for any kind of function/celebration. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We moved to the area recently so decided since it was so nice out we would try the waterfront restaurant for date night. We arrived about 7:30 and were told it was going to be about an hour wait ....since it was nice out we decided to wait and take a walk along the boardwalk. We were seated in about 40 minutes. They have a great patio, both lower and upper really close to the marina, excellent view, definitely a good spot. Since we waited 40 minutes we ordered right away, drinks, apps, dinner all at once. I had a Moscow mule and my husband a old fashioned, we also ordered the lobster and crab dip as an app. Our food arrived before our drinks? Which was odd but the drinks weren't far behind so it was ok. The dip was a VERY small portion (think a small ramekin you would use for creme brûlée). The top was VERY oily (it literally dropped off my chips), but the taste was good. The lobster however was basically non-existent. For mains my husband had the salmon with dill cream sauce, and I ordered the saganaki salad. Now I'm thinking salad...lettuce? My salad came served on a huge mound of red peppers. The menu did not list anything stating it was served on peppers. I don't like peppers raw so I basically paid $15 for some cucumbers, raw onions and a few olives with a slice of cheese. I was really upset about it. Our service we fast and our waitress very busy but lovely. Would we come back? Maybe for apps but likely not for dinner."}
{"text":"Our DINNER'S SERVED group has dined here a couple of times and have enjoyed the food and the view! Dinner's are hot when they arrive and the quantity substantial. Love the Fish & Chips!"}
{"text":"Came in Mother's Day lunch, seemed busy, we were greeted by front reception with the \"it will take 20 mins wait\" however chairs were not available to sit, picture included, patio was open so after my suggestion to have it check a bit chilly but we wanted to basically sit, at this point. Server was attentive, took starter and drink order and brought drinks out promptly. She mentioned she was new, but was very courteous and attentive to my kids as well. Food was pretty good, I would go again food and menu pictures included: 
Curry flavour Clams frites
Wild mushroom and chicken Rigatoni
Penne Arrabbiata with 6 mini shrimp
Kids: penne sauce-
Appetizers-Mac and cheese croquettes
Roasted beet arugula goat cheese salad"}
{"text":"Folks, my wife and I have been attending this Pickering gem since they opened many years ago and try to visit at least once every 2 weeks. From a customer point of view and regular dine out couple we find the Waterfront Bistro to be the most consistant food quality and service than any other restaurant we have frequented. 
I know every restaurant can have an off day from a dinners perspective or from a personality clash with someone but I'm very very suprized at some of these negative reviews which are not being done as objective or constructivly but rather a rant.
If Yelp wants to continue to be considered a place for people to provide reviews for all of the business I would hope you create some kind of rating standard and also have a more consitant review of the users comments against these standards.
As for the folks who read these negative reviews I would suggest that you visit for yourself on days other than valentines and mothers day to give this place an opportunity to show you what quality and value is all about

regards
Dave & Carol

p.s I challenge anyone out there to try the prime rib and please let me know where you have a better quality/value piece of meat any where in Durham region :-)

p.s. 2 If you have any staff or food concern while visiting a restaurant I would suggest you speak to the manager for a quick resolve versus just venting on a public site (just saying)"}
{"text":"Def. a great place to bring family for sunday brunch. Been there for dinner as well. Loved the ambience. Great staff and food."}
{"text":"One of my absolute fave spots is Frenchman's Bay out in Pickering.  Very scenic spot just east of Scarborough that makes it feel as though you're nowhere near the City so it gives you that nice balance.  Here you've got your local eateries and boutique shops and of course the Waterfront Bistro, a great spot overlooking the marina and Lake Ontario.  

Pretty laid back atmosphere with pretty attentive servers.  Last time we went, it was a little windy and there was a chance of showers so a number of servers showed their concern as we were here with a toddler; so yes, very accommodating staff.  The food of course is very enjoyable.  They also have specials throughout the week which makes it even better.  Been coming here for years so their menu has changed a couple of times but there hasn't been a time where I fell disappointed.  

[Appetizers & Salads]
Saganaki Flambe - Can't go wrong with fried cheese.  Has a nice crusty outside with a gooey inside.  Perfect to get you started. 5/5. 

Calamari Frite - Just rightly dusted and fried.  Wish the serving was larger and that it had a little bit more taste in the seasoning.  Still quite good, though. 4/5

Saganaki Village Salad - Perfect side to either share or to have as a meal if you're not too hungry.  You get a huge piece of the wonderful fried cheese which is about the size of a slice (medium) pizza.  5/5.

[Mains] 
Waterfront Burger - One of their staple burgers.  Great with a side of salad, fries or sweet potato fries. 5/5.

Fish & Chips - After a couple of menu changes, I'm glad that this is one item that they've kept.  I believe they use haddock and I (used to) prefer halibut but this definitely somewhat converted me.  You get a generous piece of fish as well as a generous amount of their fresh cut fries which are amazing, by the way.  If you like Swiss Chalet fries, you'll definitely love their fries.  It has been a while since I've last had their Fish & Chips so hopefully this hasn't changed either. 5/5.

Mussels & Frites - Mussel Mondays!! If you're around on Mondays, definitely take advantage of this offer as it's half price.  I'd still pay full price for this dish as it's bursting with flavour.  You get two choices of sauces either a marinara or a light curry sauce.  My personal preference is the curry sauce.  You also get a side of sweet potato fries which by the way is one of the best out there.  I don't know what they do with it but I hope they continue because it's one of the best out there. 5/5. 

Roaster Wings - Size could be larger but the wings are juicy and crispy so this is definitely worth checking out.  Tuesday nights are wing nights so if you're a little skeptical with their wings, then I'd recommend taking advantage of this particular offer."}
{"text":"I've come here once before and everything was alright, nothing amazing...this time, I had 1 primary complaint and that was that I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese for $24 and I couldn't believe it when I distinctly tasted fake crab meat (I've had lobster on many occasions from around the world and know that it can taste very different depending on location, I've also had fake crab meat many many times and this was 100% fake crab meat). I had my room mate try a bite of only the \"lobster\" and he was grossed out and said there was zero doubt that this was fake crab meat...We will not be returning as this is unacceptable for a location to lie about what's in their food, use cheap product and charge $24 for it...not impressed."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night in late October it wasn't a busy night. Service  was excellent,  the pasta was delicious and a 6 oz. glass of wine was on special for $5. Terrific evening"}
{"text":"I dined here, to compare the experience to Port (in Pickering).
While Port has a nicer view (even in the winter with the large windows),  I had a cozier and more relaxed evening at the Waterfront.

The inside is cozier and more casual. The food is less expensive than Port, but in my opinion better - larger portions and more fresh and well cooked.

They have live music on Saturday nights.

While I loved the soft rock/classics the singer was entertaining us with, my only complaint is they ALSO have recorded music playing simultaneously - which makes a bit of an awkward and irritating evening.

NOTE TO MANAGER: turn off the darn radio/CD and let us enjoy the singer!!"}
{"text":"Lovely area, especially in the summer time. I love their patio with the  beautiful view. 
I like their burgers and fries. Also fish and chips are pretty good. We went their for a nice dinner and live music with some friends.  I like their salsa music on the weekend. Lots of fun to dance and watch others. 
After the dinner we went for a nice walk along the lake. Just make sure you grab some mosquito spray as you get lots of them there."}
{"text":"Sitting here for 15 mins & still waiting for a glass of water...

I was here in April and had a good experience so I decided to come back for dinner.  What a mistake.  Waited for about 15 mins in a line to get a table.  We were then taken to a table on their half empty patio!!!!  Like WTF.  We then waited for a glass of water.  Time to meal=45mins.  Totally unacceptable.  Uninspiring service from our server.   Food's not all that either.  This place must think they are the shit being one of the only waterfront restos in Durham.  I will not return."}
{"text":"It is SUCH a shame that such a perfect location on the lake is taken up by this place. Seriously: crummy food at a minimum of $14 a plate. None of the menu is exciting or creative (apart from maybe serving mussels). So not worth it. The biggest problem I had here was the service; they seem VERY unorganised. I have no idea who our waitress was because it was someone different any time they made it around to our table.
A beaaautiful location on the second floor patio was definitely nice compensation."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but seems as though the hostess purposely makes you wait for a table when there are ones available. They do not take reservations for outdoor tables, but keep 3-4 empty tables open.  When you ask why they have completely setup tables (with utensils, etc) vacant, they give you attitude and answer quite rudely. Reminds me of a nightclub bouncer and how they treat people - very poor. I think this will be my last visit to this restaurant. I'd rather spend my money where it's actually wanted.
The management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this. Prime location can only take you so far."}
{"text":"Love the location and food was good with huge portions.  Would love to come back when it's warmer so I can sit on the 2nd floor patio to enjoy the lake view."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that i was very disappointed with the food at this restaurant. My husband and I reserved here for our 10th wedding anniversary dinner - the atmosphere is lovely, near the Pickering waterfront, and the service was great, however, our dinner left little to be desired. Starting with our beverages, I am not a \"big drinker\" but when I do drink, Stella beer is my go-to. I ordered a Stella (draft) and it tasted off - no bubbles and had a sour aftertaste.  That was my first disappointment. Secondly, my husband and I chose to share a large salad (chopped salad) and an order of dry-rubbed wings (there are 8 wings in one order). The salad was ho-hum...i could see they \"tried\" with presentation, but it was mediocre in taste and nothing special about it. The wings however were probably the worst I've ever had - they were large, but they were absolutely tasteless and very dry inside. I realize we did order a \"dry rub\" (as opposed to a sauce that would perhaps be more flavourful), but the rub was supposed to be \"pepper & Parmesan\", and honestly - there was zero taste to the wings.  $80+ later, i have to say i was very disappointed with our anniversary dinner. The only thing that made it \"okay\" was being there with my husband and enjoying the atmosphere through the windows."}
{"text":"Second time I'd been here and I wasn't all that impressed overall. 

Hostess seated us RIGHT in front of the performer when there were at least 10 other empty tables that I saw as we walked in - no way they were all resos. So noisy. 

Seemed like they only had one server covering the entire front section and he was taking forever so I snagged what I would guess was the bar manager and ordered through him. 

Food and drinks came out somewhat slowly... Ordered chicken parm sandwich which was good but the piece of chicken was about four inches wide and the bread was a ciabatta or something - only an inch and a half so there wasn't even nearly enough bread for this sandwich = very meet and awkward to eat. Delicious otherwise. Fries were extremely bland, took one bite and didn't bother with them afterward. 

Asked for the bill as well as the food came to the table because I didn't want to wait. Server didn't come to check on us once until it was time to process payment. Bar manager checked on us once or twice - he's the only reason I'm giving this a 2 star eating instead of 1. 

This place needs to step their game up. But then again, maybe they don't. Not a lot of options around that area - I'm just critical since I've worked in the service industry my entire adult life."}
{"text":"Again looking for outside eating near water. We were driving east from Toronto and found this quaint town and enjoyable place. Outside dining has umbrellas on most tables, but not all (not a problem for us but it appeared to be for others). Ordered the special burger of the day and it was fantastic! A great stop!"}
{"text":"Loved the Lobster Ravioli special. It was so incredibly filling. The sauce was full of flavour. If you aren't a fan of lobster: You barely taste the lobster given that the sauce is so rich!!!"}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

My monthly dinner with Ms. B, my high school English teacher always brings me into the 'burbs out East.  

I have dined at the Waterfront twice, the other time having been in the summer.  The patio is always busy in the summer as it overlooks the water.  Considering the view, the prices here are quite reasonable.  The food is also pretty decent.  

I had the Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Panini, and Ms. B had the Stuffed Pasta Shells and her standard 1/2 litre of House White.  

The grilled veggie and goat cheese panini was quite tasty, and I substituted it with their sweet potato fries.  My only complaint was that the panini bread is a tad bit thick, and felt more like a filler to me.  I would've appreciated more filling than just thick slabs of bread.  The sweet tater fries were good - but then again, how do you mess that up?

Ms. B's pasta shells were barely warm when it arrived so we sent it back and they heated it back up for us.  You get about 5 shells, which are stuffed to the nines and quite filling.  She couldn't finish her dish.

The service here is a hit and miss.  Perhaps in the summer months they are more sufficiently staffed, but tonight they definitely weren't.  After we were seated we were ignored for quite some time - not even some water while we were perusing the menu.  Towards the end of the night, they had a newbie server who kept coming over every 5 minutes to interrupt us, asking if she could clear anything away for us... Even when it was just our water glasses sitting at the table?

All in all this is a pretty decent place to go during the summer.  The patio is great, the food is fairly priced and pretty good.  Of course, if you compare it to the array of restaurants in Toronto - it wouldn't stand a chance."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. The restaurant was very loud. It was hard to talk. 
The restaurant didn't have draft Coors Light so we ordered steam whistle. After a solid 10 minutes, our waiter came back to say they didn't have it. Strange it took so long to find that out. We ordered Bud Light. I saw the bartender pour our beer, then I watched our beer sit waiting for our water to get it. I actually wanted to get up and get them myself. Not to be rude, but just because we had to been waiting so long. 
The owner came around to our table twice, to say hello. I thought that was very nice. 
I ordered the King Panini. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib sandwich. I ordered a Greek salad as a side. It wasn't very good. I did like the peppers that were added to it, but a dot of feta cheese, 2 cucumber slices, a small slice of tomato and 2 olives was pretty pitiful. My boyfriend said the prime rib sandwich was better at canyon creek. My sandwich was good though.
My advice to them, add more veggies, olives & cheese to the Greek salad. Also, offer a side container of horseradish to go with the prime rib."}
{"text":"If you're looking for casual to find dining in Pickering and Ajax, look no further. My  favourite item on the menu, oysters Rockefeller! Have never tasted such a great oysters Rockefeller in my life! The osso bucco and the lamb shank are to die for as well. Never been disappointed with any meal I've had at the waterfront. Great Thursday night entertainment too! Always feel welcome."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 5 and 2 babies on a Sunday afternoon (August 21 to be exact, at around 2:45 to 3pm). Upon walking in I kindly asked the host (an older Caucasian lady with blonde hair) if we could be seated outside. Instead of kindly responding or giving us the option to be seated inside until a table came up, she rudely and egregiously replied to me saying NO, implying we were a big group and it was too much of a hassle to find 2 tables to be put together. I told her that we had no issue waiting, and we would happily have drinks indoors until a table came up, until she continued to imply that it was too much of a hassle for her and she didn't want to do it. I asked her \"so is that a no?\" And she actually responded with yes, that's a no, I'm not finding you a table. 

after realizing I was upset with her unnecessary attitude, she came in 5 minutes after I was seated and told me there was suddenly an opening for a table ground level patio. Although I appreciate the \"after the fact\" effort, her negative attitude upon my arrival made me realize that PORT next door is a much better establishment and much more courteous with a better view."}
{"text":"I ordered the mussels & frites with a light curry sauce. It was very yummy but maybe the curry was a tad too salty. Love their fries!

Such beautiful views of the Pickering waterfront from here and its patios! However I recommend sitting on the ground floor patio because the second floor one was full of bugs! Service was great though."}
{"text":"My wife and I were cycling on the Waterfront Trail when we came across this restaurant.  We had just rode 20km... we were tired, hungry and needed a place to place to relax for a while.  This place was perfect.

Very friendly staff.  They went out of their way to get us a table close to where are bikes were parked.  The food was excellent.  Their burger was surprisingly good, fresh cut fries, nice plating.  The atmosphere was perfect, exactly what we needed after such a long ride.  Great view, 'coffee house' music playing in the background.

Will definitely go back on our next bike trip!"}
{"text":"Old tired recipes.  Food mediocre at best. Be prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"The 80's called, they want their decor back! A coat of paint here and there would be nice. Such a fantastic location, which is being let down by a lack of maintenance.

Staff were nice, but.....

Hostess had to go check to see if there was a table available for us, when there was only about 10 tables in the whole place. You've got one job....

When asked who brews the special \"Durham\" beer that is specially brewed for them, our waitress did not know who the brewer was.

Then, my beer was delivered to the table a full 10 minutes after the other drinks at the table. I had to flag down another staff member to order my second beer, as our waitress had vanished.

The bruschetta and \"spin dip\" (as the waitress called it) were ok, but nothing special.

The waterfront vibe surrounding The Waterfront is so awesome that I had high expectations. Everything from the decor and lack of maintenance to the food and service just seemed a bit lazy. Instead of being awesome like it should be, this place is meh."}
{"text":"Had the spinach salad, it's on par. Really liking the server and trying to figure out a witty way to ask for her number :p

My friend had the Fish and Salad, I didn't taste the fish but it looked pretty good for deep fried fish. Not sure of the type, was probably haddock but I am unsure."}
{"text":"There's not much to do in Pickering but they've got the waterfront which is beautiful! And perched right by the marina is this restaurant!

It's a bit old looking but at the same time it's clean and a comfortable environment. Very lounge feeling in the restaurant or you can be seated by the bar. If you enjoy the sunlight, you can sit out in their spacious patio seating. Staff are friendly and accommodating here

The food was pretty good. It wasn't anything all that special, hence the 3 star rating over all. We ordered the calamari which was fried with a light coating. It didn't taste like much of anything but the sauce was great!

I had the fish and chips. The fish was thinly coated with batter which is what I prefer. The fish was very thick and i really liked that. It didn't taste the freshest, but still quite good! Those chips though... They are AMAZING!! I'm pretty sure if I return, I'll just order mussels and their home made chips (fries). So good!!

:)"}
{"text":"Went to The Waterfront last weekend with a group of friends (about 15 of us).
The food was EXCELLENT!!
The owners took great care of us and the staff were very attentive.  With such large meal portions, my friends couldn't finish their meals, so I was privileged to sample more than just the stuffed chicken that I ordered which was tender, juicy and creamy.  The baked Salmon was spot on, roasted potatoes, pasta and salads were very flavourful.
Highly Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This visit was about a year ago yet the bad taste in my mouth still lingers.  We visited the Waterfront by chance as we decided to drive down to the marina in search of a nice late afternoon walk in the new neighborhood.  After a short stroll on the boardwalk, we decided to stop in for an early dinner.  We ordered mussels and frites, pasta del mar and the prime rib dinner with a bottle of wine.  Mussels and frites came in an oversized bowl filled with 20% of the mussels unopened.  Quality control, anyone?  Then the pasta del mar arrived way over-salted and their pasta bordering on mushy.  The prime rib was also a sad excuse for a medium rare which they said it was at the time we ordered.  The slab of meat came almost well done with no pink in the middle and slathered with their au jus which resembled more of a gravy consistency.  This below average meal cost us over $150 which is criminal.  Again, another sad restaurant that's able to stay in business because of its location and nothing else.  Will not waste my money here ever again."}
{"text":"Got the lobster crab dip with crispy naan $14 - tasted amazing. The crispy naan went really well with the dip. The dip itself had great flavours but don't go looking for chunks of lobster meat cuz thats not what this dish is about.

Also got a poutine for $10. Tasted okay. I would still prefer New York fries poutine just because I like the gravy better.

Come on a warm day to take advantage of the patio area to take in the great views. Service was excellent.

Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is my first choice in Pickering for brunch on Sunday and lunch and Dinner anyday. The staff is the best part. I always enjoy the food and the value."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars at best. 

Attitude from the server we had was very disappointing. I ordered a pint of Keith's and when I received it, there was over one inch of head or \"foam\". I asked the server \"Erica\" to top up the drink but informed me this was the standard. She had a very condescending tone and attitude for such a simple comment. 

My friend who is a bartender told the server they changed the standard from one inch to a size of a \"dime\". Correct me if I'm wrong but regardless she could have been more pleasant. She was rude about it and eventually took the glass to \"top up\". But meanwhile I could hear her complaining to the bartender. This left a very dissatisfying feeling and even after receiving the food, it was equally disappointing. 

The fish and chips were battered and oily where the grease left a mark on the plate. The fries looked darker than normal, my thought is they need to change their frying oil more frequently. 

Overall, standard of quality in regards to service and food is horrible. For the price of minimum 14.00$ per plate I would expect better quality to say the least. Never again will I come back here. I don't recommend anyone to go here. 

On the upside of things, the view is decent and they have an upstairs patio. However it doesn't make up for what is lacking."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Because of the location, this restaurant tries to feel \"high-end\", but it's actually quite average.  The portions are small and bland."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was fairly quiet.  We were seated and then waited 20 minutes without a single server even coming to say hi!!!  After a few more minutes of the same thing, we left. There was a table of 8 people that had three servers taking care of it.  As we looked around, there was another couple at another table who also had no one come to help them.  The girl who seated us kept looking at our table, clearly noticing we weren't being served but did nothing to help.  I have heard a lot of people complain about bad service here.  We experienced this first-hand.  Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is in a cute little area by the marina just off the lake. It has a great view (although when we came here it was raining, freezing, and foggy). The people who worked there seemed friendly. 

We sat down on a weekday for lunch. It was not busy inside and we're able to get a nice table, with what I assume would be a nice view on a sunny day. The menu had quite a few options. They had many wine options, drink specials, daily specials, and coffee/tea/desserts. 

The ambiance was very nice inside. It's a little upscale while still being casual. 

We ordered a crispy chicken club and fish and chips. The food presentations were good. The food, however, was nothing special. They were big portions, even with ordering a salad instead of fries I found the chicken sandwich to be super filling. There was a huge piece of chicken. So big it was slightly uncomfortable to hold. The breading was good but it was very greasy. I added a bit of hot sauce which gave it a nice kick. The salad was very fresh but I didn't care for the dressing at all. I usually love balsamic dressing but it just tasted like watered down balsamic vinegar. Maybe I should have ordered the fries instead. One other thing I didn't like was the plate. It was very narrow and rectangular, great for presentation, but awful for eating without making a mess. I didn't try any of the fish and chips but it looked good. Nice size plate as well. 

We did not order any drinks or dessert. Overall I would say this is a great place hidden away and would maybe come back in the summer to enjoy the view and explore the area some more. Hopefully next time the food won't be so disappointing."}
{"text":"Friendly bartender, she explain to us many things from Frenchman's Marina. Sailing from Toronto and had a great welcome. Place has many locals and has a low key cool environment."}
{"text":"Amazing location. If you want to sit outside you'll have to wait, but inside is still nice and sometimes has a band playing. Food is very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Despite calling a few days ahead and making reservations, we still had to wait over thirty minutes for a table which we were told was only being cleaned? It is tough to wait that long with toddlers. The service was poor. In addition to being overcharged (and on a later date reimbursed incorrectly -tax and gratuity was never refunded), our server was slow, not very attentive, had to wait ages for a coffee refill.  My eggs were delicious and so was the french toast, no complaints about the food whatsoever. However if I am not treated properly at a restaurant on several different points I will most likely never return which is a shame because that includes our whole party of 12 people who dined together."}
{"text":"I went on Thursday for a late lunch. We ordered drinks. My soft drink came with the waitress/bartenders hair in it and a floaty. Gross! She was checking my drink after that. My gut said go somewhere else to eat but decided to stay. We got the spinach dip it wasn't the greatest. We both ordered steak. My roasted potatoes were huge but dry and flavourless, obviously had been sitting for ages. There was two pieces of burnt cauliflower and a mystery vegetable. The steak was over cooked and chewy. I ate my husbands fries and 2 small bites of steak. We decided against dessert. Wasn't worth the money. Don't bother going when the patio isn't open. The service is terrible and the food is gross during the cold months."}
{"text":"Surprised to see a few 4-5 stars....

First of all, the restaurant itself is super cute! It's by the Pickering marina, and if you sit upstairs on the patio the view is breathtaking, especially in the afternoon.

The service was alright, despite the staff being kind and patient. I felt like they didn't have knowledge towards the dishes at the restaurant. When we asked for the popular dishes, our waiter wasn't 100% sure. On top of that, one of my friends asked for a vegetarian dish.. yet he named a meat dish? We were so confused.. the service def. needs to improve. Our waiter checked up on us here and there, but we had to call him or make eye contact. He was super kind though!!

The food.. uhm, is there even a nice way to put this? I got the stuffed chicken with basmati rice and vegetables. The dish had no flavour whatsoever. The chicken was def. something different, but I hoped that it would've had way more flavour to it. It literally was tasteless."}
{"text":"Thought I would try out this place since a fried recommended it. Got the tomato soup and Saganaki salad and it was delicious.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on New Year's Eve... service, food, ambiance all top notch. Looking forward to another visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio and lake views."}
{"text":"This is in a great location with a wonderful patio overlooking the lake. Food is very tasty, and worth the prices charged. However it only gets a three star rating because of the service. My wife and I have been here a number of times but each time we're forced to wait ages before being seated, only to go out to the patio and find three or four tables are empty. It's almost like they have some pretentious idea that making people wait for a table will make the restaurant look better."}
{"text":"One of the best patios/pub in Pickering. The ambiance of waterfront bistro is amazing both during the summer season and winter. The drinks are well made and the food tastes really good. The only thing I would say that I wouldn't like is that the selection is limited. However the choices that are on the menu, are great! After a great meal, you can take a walk on the board walk right in front the restaurant! Definitely a must try! 

P.S: The Caesars are amazing!!! And are served in mason jars...anything in a mason jar is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great view, staff & food!!  Recommend fish and chips and their chips are out of this world!!  Fresh cut and you should ask for side of their dill sauce.  Food is freshly made and a great place to have a pint or wine & enjoy the scenery."}
