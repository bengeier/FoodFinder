{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident due to construction work that got us turned around. The parking lot was empty so we weren't sure it'd be worth trying. Inside were some construction workers devouring their food. We were anxious to partake. The ladies at the counter were soft spoken but kind. Our orders were properly taken and the food was surprisingly superb considering the empty lot. (Due to construction). A father and adult son raved about the food and that they'd been dining there since his son was a boy. They'd developed quite a rapport with the family owned staff. Atmosphere is a bit dim in dining area and is a bit dated but once you dig in you'll never notice. Support this family owned small business. Your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"I ordered onion rings and when I went to pick them up the owner noticed the onion rings were burnt. When I asked them to replace the burnt onion rings or give me a discount she opened the to go box and threw the onion rings on the floor and when I asked why she did that she said you didn't want it and she didn't offer to replace it. I will never go back. All I asked for was good service. None to be had here!"}
{"text":"I just spent $18.15 for lunch and an uninvited guest appeared walking across the table.  One of the most expensive vomits, ever.

Please do not waste your time, gas or money.

When I told the waitress/cashier she asked me where it was and since i could not locate the roach her reply was maybe someone brought it in with them. 

Really, not an apology or let me get the manager. 

I should have just tossed the money in the trash because that is where the food is presently."}
{"text":"i love the Fish Sandwich.

Stay away from the chicken (kinda wierd considering the name) but on a few occasions it seemed dry and also it seemed as if they used the same grease.

I love the fried Okra... ummmmmmmm!!!!!
Family owned, pretty wide selection on the menu."}
{"text":"I tried the hotdog with mustard , onions , slaw , chili and I added ketchup. Hubby got cheeseburger and we got a side of fries. Hot dog was good and fries were hot and fresh but you could tell they were cooked in the same grease as chicken and fish. Hubby said the cheeseburger was good but mad it didn't come with lettuce or tomato. Decor was regular and lighting was dim. May come back to try some seafood."}
