{"text":"I opted for the Lost in Chocolate 10 inch cheesecake for my family and we loved it! It was one of the most decadent desserts I've ever eaten. I chose the flavor, placed a phone order, and in 48 hours we were enjoying our cheesecake. Customer service was wonderful from the employee taking my phone order to the delivery man. They mentioned they are working on a storefront but right now it's a cheesecake delivery concept. I had a great experience from start to finish and I would recommend this business for those seeking delicious cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten. My husband and I were trying to decide what to have for dessert at our wedding. Neither of us like cake that much so we wanted something we would enjoy. Then we watched the Friends episode with the cheesecakes and our mouths were watering. We decided we had to have cheesecake at our wedding. We did some research and read great reviews about Vinovios. I am so happy we chose them. The cheesecake is fantastic. They delivered us a sampler, all of them were amazing. We ordered 8 cheesecakes, which was more than enough for our wedding of 130 guests. They delivered them all the way out to Goodyear for us the night before the wedding. We received tons of comments from our guests about how great the cheesecake was. Thankfully, we had some left over and froze it. We have been eating cheesecake each week for the past month and a half. It's almost gone now so we will definitely need to order more. It is addicting!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheesecake online as a gift for my dad for Father's Day. I live out of country so was unable to have them call me for confirmation but provided my email and my mom's phone number. They not only called my mom to confirm, but also went out of their way to email me. Their customer service was fantastic and the whole process was very simple!  Very pleased I found them!"}
{"text":"Don't let just these two reviews scare you off. This place is AMAZING! I do monthly orders for birthday treats at our company and we have been trying to find a place to do cheesecakes, and we found it! People were saying \"can we order this every month?\", \"The crust is AMAZING\", \"I ate too many of them but it was so worth it\", \"this is perhaps the best cheesecake I've ever had\". I ordered enough fore everyone to have one individual cheesecake. If they didn't get to them quick, they might have missed out. People were going back for seconds and thirds. We have 80 people here and they are hard to please with their birthday treats. We will definitely be ordering from here again! I wish I could give them 10 stars! Great job!!!"}
