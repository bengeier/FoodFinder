{"text":"Came for lunch and did the AYCE. Wasn't busy and got seated right away. The chefs made the sushi and gave your order to you. The food was delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"shitty food with sitty service. they served miso soup with a tag attached spoon, which means they never cleaned it. I will never go back there!!! I also tried a tempura icecream and... the tempura icecream came with vanilla soup...haha...  I never recommend this place to my frineds either... !!"}
{"text":"I've lived in SW area of the valley for over 2 years but always drive to Eastern and 215 for Island Sushi.  Well no more.  Sumo Sushi 2 has the BEST sushi I have had in years.  Sushi Chef Ricky makes new creations for us to try and everything he makes is absolutely amazing!! The Johnny rolls are awesome as well as the Screaming  Orgasm!! Also their Lemonade Soju is smooth and yummy! Go there! You wont be disappointed! Plus they play K-pop...what's not to like!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place! I've had the AYCE option every visit. Good menu selection with great quality food. Just tried the baked dynamite and was not disappointed :) perfect size to share. I will be taking my friends there soon"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great atmosphere.

Just went with the gf yesterday and had some of the freshest tuna I've ever tasted.  I did the all you can eat and she did the shrimp tempura.  Neither of us was disappointed.

Just a warning, when it says \"Not a roll\" in the sushi description, expect about a baseball sized chunk of delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this while I was visiting friends in Vegas.  The restaurant was clean and there is a beautiful aquarium that entertained my toddler before we started eating.  They brought her a kids' plate and her bento box came in a cute bear shaped box.  Unfortunately, the food itself wasn't as impressive.  The teriyaki chicken was too rubbery for my child, and my sushi rolls seemed like they had been handled too much.  Given that there are sushi places a dime a dozen in Vegas, I won't bother going back here again."}
{"text":"Omg! I was so shocked that they were not using sushi rice at a sushi restaurant. The rice was like the rice I cook at the home. When I asked the manager, Eric, about the rice, he even lied to me said it's sushi rice. However, when I asked to show the rice package (name), he walked away??! The attitude was ridiculous rude. Besides that, they didn't let me order more shrimp skewers without any limitation sign on the menu because their reason is they just changed the menu.. overall, I highly DO NOT recommend this sushi place!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $25 plus drink deals! This is my go-to spot when friends come into town. You are guaranteed to have a good time. If there is J-pop music videos playing that night, you are guaranteed to have a great time. 

Best rolls: banana roll and the vegas lasagna. Try the pork belly...and the mochi ice cream for maximum NOM."}
{"text":"The menu with pictures is difficult to read because there are no prices.  They REALLY push the \"all you can eat\".   I felt like I was forced into ordering the all you can eat.  Ambience is 3.9 out of 5.0 stars.  Sushi itself was 3.25 out of 5.0 stars.  And the service was a 2.3 out of 5.0 stars.  The staff literally stalked us.  They interrupted our conversation like 20 times during our meal.  The staff barely spoke English.  And I felt like it was overpriced for the quality of sushi.  For Vegas, I still think I LOVE SUSHI is the best.  But for all you can eat, the SUSHI-MON on silverado ranch and Maryland is the best.  I give this place an overall rating of 2.9 out of 5.0 stars.  And the salt water fish tank was mesmerizing and an orgasmic oceanic delight!  Mahalo"}
{"text":"In order to justify a 1 star review, I have to make a confession. Once in awhile I used to buy spicy tuna roll from Vons... the grocery store... that is just around the corner from Sumo Sushi. To my surprise the spicy tuna roll I ordered from Sumo Sushi looked and tasted exactly like the spicy tuna from Vons. Not what I expected from an actual sushi restaurant. 

Then my wife wanted a Futo Maki roll, a common sushi roll in Japan. The person taking my order had no idea what it was. 

The bill for 3 rolls and a cup of miso soup to go? $27. No need to ever go back.

Overall impression: Maybe if you're a bro and just want to throw back a couple sake bombs and eat a ton of crap sushi while feeling like you're in a club this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Friends and I were looking forward to an evening of fine Japanese cuisine, after reading the reviews on Yelp.  Unfortunately, the food was \"OK\" and nothing really outstanding.  Our group of friends have lived in Japan for two years and traveled extensively throughout Japan and Asia.  Note:  This is a Korean owned and operated Japanese/sushi restaurant.  I am very particular about the shoyu sauce, especially the wasabi.  The sauce was very light, especially when eating sushi/sashimi and the wasabi was not  the freshly grated root of the wasabi plant.  I have tasted better wasabi from a tube.  The hamachi sashimi was good, not really fresh though; hamachi kama was dry; uni sushi was good; sauce for the yaki tori was very sweet.  Overall the sushi we ordered were fine, but seem to lack the \"orgasmic\" taste described by other reviewers.  I have eaten at many \"Japanese\" restaurants in Las Vegas and must admit most were \"failures.\"  The only Japanese restaurant I would rate at the top would be Nobu's.  I would not recommend Sumo Sushi 2 for those who REALLY know the joys of eating fine, Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Service was excellent tonight. Very friendly staff. Fish was soooo fresh and came out really quickly, along with the othet foods we ordered. Pork belly was a little to fatty but the other parts of it and the sauce was amazing. Baked mussels are always a favorite."}
{"text":"I went there with a $25 restaurant.com certificate. Good thing we checked with the server before we order, cuz apparently u can't use the certificate on all you can eat!! Makes sense for the business, but sucks for the people who thought they got a deal.

Plus:
-We ordered a couple of things, the dishes came out pretty fast, I think we only waited like 5 minutes before our first dish came out.
-Nice waiter! Nice atmosphere! 

Not so plus:
-Freshness of the fish is only okay, I grew up next to the ocean so I know my fish. The texture of the fish is overly soft, kinda mushy. But can't expect too much since we are in the desert.

Overall, will I go back? Maybe only if I have another restaurant.com coupon."}
{"text":"Awful. We used to come here when we were in town from Hawaii and loved it. This time we had the all you can eat option and the quality was poor at best. Service was okay, not too friendly as before. My daughter commented that her shrimp sushi was slimy....UUGGHHH. Some of the dishes were good, the steak, but steak at a sushi restaurant? too much mayo on the dishes, fish was covered in all types of sauces, too overwhelming.  Ice cream dessert was not too good also."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, great unique roll creations and terrific service but it comes at a very high price point.  I eat here every once in a while but much rather go to a sushi bar with an all you can eat option."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a restaurant.com coupon and wanted AYCE. It was the entire reason we went. I was told that you cannot use a coupon for AYCE. It wasn't written anywhere on the coupon. I was told that their manager does not allow it. Pretty disappointed. We decided to do AYCE anyway because it just makes more sense. Service was ok. We got a tiny ball of wasabi to start and I had to ask twice to get more. Sapporo draft tasted pretty old and the cherry blossom was disappointing. Mussels were good as well as the Johnny #2 and Pink Lady rolls. We ordered a Jay Burrito and were surprised to find that it was a handroll when it doesn't mention that on the menu. I'm not sure if we'll return. Their AYCE \"rules\" were pretty ridiculous. I typically don't enjoy having to read a list of rules while looking at a menu. Also, they shouldn't be selling coupons if they won't honor them for AYCE. I'm going to exchange my unused coupon to use somewhere else."}
{"text":"Place is horrible , waiting 20 mins for a single roll, did all you can eat... Ate 2 rolls in their time frame ... They had someone here cleaning the fish tank and all you can smell after he opened it was nasty dirty fish water.... Not the greatest place to come eat, take your Buisness over to 808 sushi, I normally go there and decided to try something new... Big mistake ..."}
{"text":"Went here first time because of yelp reviews. My new favorite spot... found out it now owned by my other favorite sushi but this one is closer to home.  From food to service everything is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"First time customer here. They had good staffing but their service was really slow. No one ever offered water refills and we had to waive them down for orders on food. Lost my appetite after a while because they were taking so long to take our orders.
Seemed like they were avoiding us whenever they walked by the table. Sushi overall was ok however it wasn't worth $25.95. This place definitely has potential but needs improvement."}
{"text":"- The chefs are fun and friendly. 
- The AYCE is well worth the price. 
- Never have been disappointed.
- The fish is fresh and the rolls have a lot of flavor.
- If you ask the chef to make something special they usually have no issue with showing off there skills and make something not on the menu.
- They have a happy hour during the week and on Sundays. Sapparo and Saki for a $1. Can't beat that.
- All-in-all this place is great."}
{"text":"With all the choices Las Vegas has to offer on sushi you would think that this place
Would treat the customers better.

I was here last night, the waitress got upset with me because I asked for a diet ice tea,
Some places have sugar in their ice tea so I make it a point to say diet, she gave me a mean look , I wanted to leave it was so bad,
She said @we don't have that here\", so I said ok a diet coke please.

I did the all you can eat for the $30, the fish portions were very very tiny. After about 13 minutes she brings me the bill.. WTF? I just started.. 

The chefs were ok but this place is cheap
And the waitresses just do not care about the biz... The fish was smelly too .

C'mon...run the business correctly, now adays with yelp and review sites we can make or break these type of places.

Pick another sushi joint, there's one on every corner!!  

Naked fish on Durango is killer, they are not cheap and everyone is very inviting there."}
{"text":"It was my first and last time that I will EVER go to SUMO SUSHI. I rather starve than eat there again... Worst sushi I've ever had!!!!!!! I can't believe there was people eating there. My first roll was horrible, but I decided to to give the second roll a chance and it was worse. I had one bite of each and that was enough to spoil my appetite. It was soooooooo bad that I grabbed my napkin and I had to spit it out : ( Just thinking about it makes me sick. What a waste of all you can eat."}
{"text":"I went there many times with my friends and families because  their sushi is good, BUT
They have really dirty table top cover, but they keep using it without washing it.
I even told server about it, but they did not care.
I know they are busy, but their servers do not have ability to handle their tables.
Serving time is way too slow.
Not recomended"}
{"text":"Their actual sushi tastes great. Fresh fish, nice variety. Even though I cannot eat shellfish I still have a lot to choose from and they have always been very good at accommodating me. AYCE pricing pays for itself after two/three rolls. They have well-priced lunch specials that fill you up!

However. Their customer service is lacking. Sometimes you can have up three different waiters taking your orders and I don't even really know why. You have to flag them down frequently for more ordering or drink refills after your first round. The staff are nice, but the flow can be irritating. Usually they are fine on service, but it gets worse the busier they get. Overall, pretty good sushi but the service can be shotty."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times in the last year and a half, usually amazing food and wonderful service.  It's my best friends birthday- so I brought him here for an incredible meal. 
Man,.....SOOOOO DISSAPOINTED. Food was good but the service was deplorable.   We had to flag someone down to get out water filled, order and get the check.  I can NOT recall having a worse experience at a restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Service is fast and freindly.
Sushi chef's got skills.
I had the AYCE menu for $21,  I would recommend.
I can easily eat over $100 worth of sushi and appetizers!
Try the tempura fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Quality people quality food...very attentive and tasty!! Tuna was extremely fresh, Japan like fresh and the waitresses constantly make sure all is ok with your dining experience!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for a quick lunch. Never again. 

I cannot say anything about the sushi because I ordered the lunch special bento box. I ordered the teriyaki chicken. The bento box is suppose to come with teriyaki chicken, miso soup, side salad, tempura, rice and 5 pieces of California roll. 

I was first brought my miso soup, it was alright. Then my bento box came. They did not put any dressing on the salad, mine came with only 4 pieces of California roll, teriyaki chicken tasted like it was microwaved I ate one piece and did not like it but decided to try it a second time and I could not even swallow it. I am not a picky eater at all but wow that has got to be the worst chicken I've tasted in my life. I can't explain the texture either. It was like fake chicken lol. Now the tempura.. you would think how can someone mess up tempura? Well.. Sushi sumo you managed to do that too! It was overly battered, way too thick, mushy an oily. The tempura sauce that came with it was overly salty. 

I'm pretty disappointed because all I ate were 4 dinky California roll pieces, an alright bowl of miso soup, 2 bites of fake chicken and a few bites of soggy tempura. 

The hostess/server was friendly but it does not make up for the food. I mean, who serves a salad without dressing??? It was pretty pricey too for some limp microwave chicken. 

And I took a picture, yes that is a piece of chicken I spit out lol."}
{"text":"This place was really nice and our service was excellent. Our waiter was named Alex and he was very nice and friendly. I would ask for him when you go to this location. The food was excellent as well."}
{"text":"We went in to the restaurant at 10: 50 pm ,we were the only 2 people at the place ,the waiters were nice but the guys that was doing our rolls \" ROBERTO \" was really a bad sushi maker , without saying every time we asked for a roll or a side of ponzu sauce he made a bad face taking our order, to the point we had 2 rolls and we left .
We have several sushi places  in the south west are here in Las Vegas , this place is not an option anymore .
Really uncomfortable night .
Please people DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME at this location . Shame on them !"}
{"text":"You gotta try the naruto really good and everyone is super cool and for parents they have a big fish tank so the little ones can be distracted and watch the fish."}
{"text":"The customer service in this place is really good. The waiters and waitresses are very helpful and attentive. The food is tasty and the AYCE price is not bad either considering it includes everything on the menu, even the desserts. Definitely going to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi. So far the best sushi I've tasted. The chef was funny (forgot his name) but he let me try a little plum wine which was AMAZINGLY good. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I have been to sumo the second around 5 times. Being a larger fellow, I always get the ayce . This place is what a guy wants in a Vegas sushi joint. Big extravagant rolls that come out as fast as Schumacher drives his car. The Vegas lasagna is one for the ages. Sometimes they will forget an item or two , but who cares. Just order it again. I would imagine this only happens with ayce. You will have about 4 people waiting on you and bringing you food. Also the creepy Japanese music videos play on the projection screen , I enjoy that ."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy the sushi here!!! Had a lot if fun w my friends, my only gripe was that even tho they weren't busy the server was slow w our drinks, but the sushi came out fast at least. The chefs really get into character too it's kinda funny."}
{"text":"Really great experience! Had Tiffany as our server and she was amazing! She recommended us some rolls based on some sushi we already put in. The fried tempura ice cream was also amazing. You also get stamps for ayce visits. If you get 10 stamps, 1 ayce order will be free!"}
{"text":"SO good! We love it here! Great service, atmosphere and food!!! Love the Vegas lasagna, Orange blossom, Joe roll and many many more!"}
{"text":"The sushi is overpriced with small portions and they are very strict about their \"all you can eat\" menu. They will charge you extra if you leave any food at all on your plate, even salad.

The sushi is average, and the service is bad. There are so many better choices for sushi in Las Vegas than Sumo Sushi II. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Southwest Vegas!!
It's not worth it going any where else if you live SW and want to stay close. Sumo Sushi 2 has the greatest staff, always ready to help refill, you will never run out of water, drinks or sushi if you're doing all you can eat! 
Rolls are fun and very yummy! My favorites are Yum Yum Crunch, Dragon, Rainbow and Sunset!

The chefs are fun! It's 25.99 for AYCE dinner or 20.99 for lunch until 3pm! You'll have a really great experience here!!"}
{"text":"We came in after a bad day at work. We were hungry and not in the best of spirits, but this place changed that instantly. We were greeted warmly and sat at the sushi bar. Both the waiter and sushi chef took great care of us. We ordered off the AYCE menu. Super fresh, super tasty!"}
{"text":"This Place Is Great! 

I have been coming here with friends for the last 6-8 months and will definately continue to do so. The great atmosphere and very friendly/efficient service is helps in my decision but the main reason we keep coming back is the food. 

Everything is always fresh and delicious. No tiny rolls here with rediculous amounts of rice.. They pack a ton of fish and veggies into their rolls without the overwhelming amounts of rice. Its just enough and you will definately be full and satisfied. 

The head sushi chef and his dishes are amazing and JayJay is always our server. 
Definately a great place to eat and enjoy a good time."}
{"text":"Sushi Chef was the most unpleasant person.. he pretty much threw my plates at my 7 year old and I.. and my rolls just fell apart. He was so rude to us but when a couple and their child sat down next to us, he was nice to them. Then our server dropped my check, didn't even ask if we wanted anything else.. I guess you don't want my business.. sushi isn't worth the terrible service. Don't know what I did to upset you guys but when someone comes in trying to be nice and polite you should give that back in return.. especially when you're running a business.."}
{"text":"I have had 3 bad experiences at Sumo lately. I'm beginning to think it's because I'm Filipino. The bad experience is always with the same Sushi chef, the Korean one, same experience with the same Korean server. Time maybe to look for another Sushi place to go."}
{"text":"Used to come here regularly before the new management and loved it. However, I cannot say I'm a fan now. Service was rude and bothersome. Food tasted great, but turned into an awful case of food poisoning for both my friend and I. Bummed that we will have to find a new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"3.5, but giving a 4 for the Stars

Pros:

- AYCE...priced right and good selection between lunch/dinner menus...we ate like 30+ different items off the dinner

- Nicely portioned nigiri

- They have fresh oysters!

Cons:

- Some of the rolls tasted the same from one and another

- Udon was really simple

- Service was present...just completely without a friendly feel

Stars:

- Hooked up a kid meal without charge!"}
{"text":"I love ayce sushi in Vegas, and over time this has developed into my favorite spot.

I almost never have to wait to be seated, and I never feel rushed or pressured.  They have a decent crowd, but it's a big place with plenty of room, and you never feel crowded like some of the other ayce places.  They have some great walled off booths that are very comfortable.  Service is fast and friendly.  It only took a couple visits for the staff to remember me, and now I feel like a welcomed regular every time I come in.

This is where I bring my out of town friends that don't have the joy of Vegas ayce in their cities, but often I come here by myself and enjoy a long, leisurely dinner and I'm always encouraged to order as much as I want and linger as long as I like as a welcomed guest.

The food is great, the menu is varied, and I like both the rolls and the nigiri.  My favorite is the \"something wrong 69\" roll and the Cajun albacore, which I get every time and definitely recommend.  There is also a pretty good selection of non seafood, so it's perfect if your group is craving sushi but there is the one friend in the bunch that doesn't want seafood.

If you stop by, ask for Nate and he'll take care of you.  He's awesome."}
{"text":"-best sushi in Vegas (other than sumo sushi in Henderson)
-new management has WONDERFUL wait staff....truly want to make you happy
-all you can eat has wide variety of menu items
-food was prompt
-kids under 3 ft tall eat free (like a roller coaster ride) 
-large fish tank good for kids and adults
-waiters were literally waiting about ten ft behind the table ready to accommodate our every request 
Sushi is amazing here and ruined all other sushi for me forever.  Ponzu sauce is a whole different level.  Joe special, something wrong 69, spicy salmon were favorites."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time however the service and food was terrible.  Gave it another chance after a few years and it was amazing.  The food was fresh and our server, Tiffany, was great and gave us amazing recommendations based on our other orders."}
{"text":"Chu- Chu is the S***t! Every time I go in it's better then the last time! I have never had anything less then fresh . It's a great price for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"I never came here before the old management, but I really liked it. Service was wonderful and everyone is very friendly. All you can eat for lunch is $20.95 and it's pretty worth it. Towards the end, I couldn't eat the rest of 1 roll and the waitress said it was ok because of everything I had ordered previously. I was impressed with that so I tipped her 20%. It's hard to get great service these days in Vegas. The food was high quality too. There are better places to go, in my opinion, but this is really nice if you're in this area, which is close to Wet 'n' Wild."}
{"text":"Came here about 4pm on a week night, was not too busy since it was before the dinner rush, and as I was there till about 5:30 the dinner rush does pick up a lot. 
    I love sushi and have tried it from many different places in Hawaii where I know the fish is fresh and Japanese culinary skill always on point. Trying this place, we were cautiously hopeful...its delicious!
  My boyfriend and I got the All You Can Eat dinner special for $26 (which is a steal! because sushi can be sooo expensive in any place), with that you are able to choose anything from a four page menu of different appetizers, rolls, nigiri and dessert BUT you are limited to only 90 minutes for your meal, which I will explain later can put a damper on the meal.
  There are some restrictions of course, for some of the premium items you are only allowed to order it once per AYCE paying person, I think the only one we got was the Spicy Tuna Salad, which was great, fresh greens with sashimi in a spicy sauce, yum! (Really loved that sauce). 
   Somer other dishes that we got and that I would recommend, are the Sunset roll, baked mussels 2pc (of which we got multiple orders of:), Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, and any of the Tempura Ice Cream desserts. This place has one of the better tasting ice cream tempuras I've had the pleasure of tasting :))
   **Ive reviewed this as 4 star and not 5 star based on the time it takes to place the order, there seemed to be 2 waitresses at the time we went (4pm) with a third coming as we left (5:30). Our water needed refilling and we wanted to put in some orders but took a while. 
   **For the AYCE you have 90 minutes approximately and they recommend you order only what you know you can eat so as not to waste :) This meant we ordered a few dishes at a time, and once finished put in another order. The only thing that bugged us is that since we could not get a waitress as regularly as we would've liked we were waiting to put in our order and then waiting for our dishes to come out long after we finished our previous order of dishes.
We still really enjoyed our meal and would come back, and our experience would only be better knowing which dishes we'd like to get on the first order :))"}
{"text":"The sushi chefs are friendly and the staff is very attentive.  The tuna karai is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ok I went in on a Friday night around 7 pm this experience was even better than normal. I am in LOVE  wth this place. I am almost through my third stamp card too. Must go!!!! No really go now."}
{"text":"I love This place. The food is amazing, and service is  perfect. I like their tuna naruto, spicy Tataki roll.
Thank you Sumo sushi 2 always."}
{"text":"Looking for some good sushi for lunch one day.  I walked into sumo sushi.

I was immediately greeted by the sushi makers at the bar.  I was sat, looked at the menu, and struck up a conversation with the cook.  Such great ingredients, fresh wasabi, house made soy sauce!!!  Everything is done to the highest standards.  I am still hoping to go there for live sashimi nights (Friday and Saturday) live lobster, giant clam, sea urchin, and Japanese mackerel!  I am a regular and will recommend it to anyone who loves good sushi!"}
{"text":"NomNommm, I love this place because the food is AMAZING! It's my favourite sushi place! The prices are decent. 
Service could use more entertainment or a happy vibe because it feels quite empty... but I can't complain cause I love the food !"}
{"text":"Different every time we go. The first few times we ate here sushi was great, decor not so much. However not a deal breaker. The last few times we have went the service was very poor, the fish in the tank were dying and the glass needed to be badly cleaned. My sushi was soggy and couldn't hold shape at all. My partners fish was very dry and the miso soup tasted like dirty dishwater. I really want to like this place as I know how good it can be but it's just not worth the gamble anymore..."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi and awesome restaurant environment/set up! The private seating makes you feel presidential. They have this hugeeee fish tank with some IDK what the hell kinda fish and eel swimming in it LOL. Great to take your gf or wifey. They do offer all you can eat for Under $30.00. Sashimi is not included with the all you can eat which sucks but their raw sushi rolls were delicious and dessert is included!"}
{"text":"Great food and great chefs. We have been eating there for 3 years and recently they brought the old chefs back and they are back on their game! Excellent specialty rolls with mega flavor. Fun atmosphere and friendly staff. I would suggest reservations on the weekends as again, they brought their super chefs back and the place is hopping :O)"}
{"text":"First off, I know next to nothing about Sushi.  But I do know about service and what I would expect out of a restaurant.  Sumo Sushi 2 just about hits the spot, but does miss in a few areas.

To start, the area's where it does miss is in overall ambiance and location.  As my friend mentioned in her review, the music was set to XM 30: Hits, which at times had rap music playing (Chingy's \"Ridin' Dirty\" in particular).  This took away quite a bit from our mood.  The other downside is the location.  The sushi here is good but not spectacular; being further out on Durango, it is not worth the drive.

The food itself was good, perhaps a little exspensive but again I don't know sushi as well.  We had a fried roll with cooked shrimp that was good but not spectacular.  

A few things I particularly like are the sushi bar with the sports playing above it and the HUGE salt-water fish tank stocked with a wolf eel, ray and lionfish.  It is worth just sitting there and having some sake to check this out.  

Also, considering how close it is to my friends apartment, I will probably be going here anytime I hang out with her simply because of how convenient it is.  It was particularly slow there, as well, on a Saturday night about 6pm, which is bad for them but good for us. 

On Friday and Saturday they are open till 2 A.M. for your late night cravings."}
{"text":"This is a SUPREME sushi joint! The food is always fresh and delicious!  The staff is attentive, warm and joyful! I Love this place!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in Las Vegas! Amazing sushi, the staff is always on FIYA! Baked green mussels are on the all you can eat menu and are the best I've ever had in any sushi spot! Awesome prices! Miss you guys a lot!"}
{"text":"Tasty sushi, well organized menu with a picture for almost every dish/roll, and I have never been to a sushi restaurant where they have all you can eat. Such a fab idea. We had two waitresses throughout our dinner (kinda strange but I understand when it's all you can eat) and my boyfriend, his two relatives and myself probably ordered 6 times total. What I found was frustrating is that on our 4th or 5th cycle, we got the food we ordered the 1st cycle. Not really consistent and cannot understand what I'm clearly saying half the time. To conclude, a pretty satisfying experience but I must say : unless your into Japanese music blasting from two huge projectors from one wall to the next, it's not a romantic quite type of vibe."}
{"text":"i can say 'the worst sushi in Las Vegas'
rice was under cook without any taste.
it was way too much rice underneath sashimi so i couldn't taste of sashimi at all.
plus sever was new and she doesn't know any thing at all- i shouldn't try this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not often that we venture off to try new sushi places but I can honestly say I probably will never again. I am not a sushi snob by any means but this place was bad all around. Walked in smelled of bad fish (1st sign) , I ordered garlic tuna nigiri and it was completely inedible. Drowned in garlic ponzu sauce and falling apart. The rolls were very poorly presented, very sloppy and not quality at all. I get ayce, and I get you don't get the best fish ever but come on guys. We are usually in and out of our ayce extravaganzas in 30 mins maybe 45...we were here for an hour and 30 mins waiting, waiting to order, waiting for water refills, waiting for desert and waiting for our check. I waited over 15 minutes just to get my card back and at that point I was done. Its bad when you get all you can eat and choose not to eat anymore just because the food isnt good. We didnt get our moneys worth of the ayce price whatsoever but i couldnt do it anymore. I watched all of the staff stand around chit chatting and just leaning against the counter, no attention at all to their tables. I literally had to get up and get my check, sign and walk out. Needless to say we will never be back to Sumo Sushi...very disappointed."}

{"text":"I enjoy the food, service and atmosphere. ..Been coming here for a few years now and still enjoying...Wish they hadn't changed few of the things on the menu, but at the same time they added new good items to the menu.."}

I came on my lunch break by myself I sat there for over 10 minutes waiting for a server to come and take my order well I was waiting another table with 4 people came in will see you there and the waitress went to help them right away so I got up and left and walked out without even ordering it what a waste of my 30 minute break from work never again these people need to learn customer service"}
{"text":"5 stars and I don't take this lightly. I LOVE this place. The sushi is amazing, the service is impeccable, the music is nice (appropriate volume) and most important the staff is outstanding. My son and I had a 2 times a week sushi habit. But, we had to end it because the service was so awful at our old favorite spot. After 2 sushi bar AYCE experiences, we knew we found our new home. Thanks for making me fall in love with sushi all over again."}
{"text":"My family and I were a bit tired of the Vegas buffet, so we decided to venture outside of the Strip for our last dinner in Vegas.

We found Sumo 2 on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We also got a $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com, so we knew we were in for a nice deal. Little did we know dinner at Sumo 2 turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip.

The atmosphere was nice and friendly. Our table of 10 were seated at a corner of the restaurant. Service was good. But the real winner was the food. Everything was very delicious. We could not stop marveling at how yummy our rolls/bento/udon/grilled fish were. 

Overall, we had a great time here. My mom made sure we got a couple of their business cards so she could return to this restaurant next time she's in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"great ayce. orders come out really fast. the sushi can take some time though. one time we were done eating before the sushi came out. but their food is really good."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service!!  $25.00 for all you can eat was totally worth it.  Great rolls and nigiri and everything was brought to the table pretty fast.  Our server was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  On a busy Friday night, she was excellent!  Great AYCE spot.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Hokido years where my favorite chef Eric worked!! I am so glad he moved over to Sumo! He has added so much to the environment and is a professional at his craft!! The oyster shooter are my favorite. The service is quick and friendly and they always have lots of different high end fish on special."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I just want something yummy and fast. I always get the tuna tataki salad, its real light and the dressing is amazing plus they don't short you on tuna. The staff is always great and I feel like I'm having a meal with them even when I'm alone. Definitely recommend it for quick lunches or casual dinner."}
{"text":"I used to go to their original location in Green Valley when I lived over in that area. I tried this location when they first opened a couple of years ago and like the original location, the food quality and freshness of the fish was excellent. I never went back, because the AYCE movement took over the local Las Vegas sushi scene and I just had to have AYCE for the value. As of a few months ago, Sushi Sumo 2 has all AYCE! 

The freshness, variety, and quality are all still there. Everything I have tried here is excellent. The tuna is always a bright red, a sign of freshness. There is a huge selection of rolls to fit any taste. A couple of my favorite dishes are the Tuna Karai - almost like a poke. You get a large portion mixed in a very tasty sesame sauce. Definitely the best poke I've had. The other is the Tuna Naruto - a sushi roll without rice and seaweed. It's a variety of fish and veggies wrapped in a hallowed out cucumber, It's excellent. 

The restaurant us outfitted nicely and makes you feel that you are in a sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly and efficient as well. This is the best AYCE sushi place that I have been to."}
{"text":"Been here many of times...but today was unacceptable!!! My biggest peeve is getting sat and getting unnoticed for ten minutes. We decided to leave and go somewhere else for sushi. SS2, make sure your staff pays attention and communicates to fellow team-members about their station getting sat. So  that you dont have paying guests up and leave. 

Best of luck"}
{"text":"I was on my way to 808 Sushi only to find out that they are not open till 4pm.  WTF?  
Anyhow, knew Sumo was around the corner so we gave it a shot.  The AYCE menu (Which is normally my preferred choice) was not appealing at all.  The specialty rolls were not on that menu.  So we ordered ala carte.  
We ordered all specialty rolls and the food was excellent.  The service was pretty fast but then again there were only like 4 other people there.  I still left full and spent less than I did having AYCE at Oyishi a few weeks earlier which was much less impressive.  
I would certainly suggest Sumo if you are looking to go for an ala carte meal."}
{"text":"This is our local sushi bar and we  have never had a reason to venture further. This place offers cheap weekday drinks, good food, and fun staff. They can get busy on weekend nights so get there early for a table if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now and everytime has been great. We bring our 3 year old and he eats some rice and edamame. The waiters and waitresses are always on top of everything. The ambiance is good, sushi chefs are friendly and funny. I love trying different rolls We always enjoy our dinner here. We used to go to inaka quite often but I always felt like I was a burden on the staff.  At sumo sushi we feel welcome. Customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"When we moved to LV 6 yrs ago, SS2 was the BEST!!! Then there was a change in management...
We walked in, it smelled of bleach, however the menus were dirty and stinky, the beautiful aquarium our kids loved is a disaster, and the staff...
Well not one of them was Japanese. Not saying any other ethnicity cannot create bomb sushi, but the vibe is gone. I ordered a salad, it was drowned in dressing I couldn't even eat it, the server blamed the cook rather than apologize. I ordered miso soup that never came.
 The 2 female servers did not even know what was in the sushi rolls or which ones they were bringing to the table. They stood around chatting when \"If you can lean, you can clean,\" I always say. The server was way too chatty, soooo happy I was wearing a sweater, I am sleeved on both arms and I just knew she'd be one of those people would've stayed at the table trying to talk tattoos while we had a mouth full of sushi.
We missed the \"hip hop sushi place\" we knew and loved, the staff was all Japanese in very nice black pants/skirts and button up shirts. 
We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and got a voucher to use since it's so close to me but the last time I went was terrible.
first of all the soy sauce had a funny taste to it, it wasn't kikkoman, it was lee kum kee which is this chinese brand that tastes like watered down soy sauce with hints of teriyaki?  with sushi it just tastes off.
We had the all you can eat but nothing was that appetizing and the fish just didn't seem fresh.  
Also ordered shimp tempura which was NOT shrimp tempura, it was a skinny shrimp inside a mountain of batter and then encased in panko crumbs.
I still have a voucher left for them but i'm reluctant to use it and i've never hesitated at using free money before.
For the area you're better off going to Hokkaido (which has much better fish), or 808 (for tasty non-sushi japanese-hawaiian things...they have sushi too but it's also meh)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Amazing!!! Amazing!! That's all I can say to this restaurant. Chef Roberto is the best sushi chef in Las Vegas! He is very fast and efficient. The food here tastes fresh and delicious. The all you can eat price is reasonable and the inside decoration is nice and if you have kids, they have a giant aquarium tank for them to gaze at. This restaurant has everything you can ask for at a sushi restaurant!  5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to sumo sushi for my first time and just ordered some takeout. I ordered the Grand canyon roll, which was described as having crab, avocado inside, and topped with shrimp, scallop, and mushroom in dynamite sauce and also having eel sauce. It was just under $13 with tax.
 Unfortunately when I got home and took it out it was one box with a cold dry California roll like you would buy at the supermarket and a separate box with a shrimp scallop mixture that was warm and a separate container of eel sauce. I combined it all myself and it was bizarre and mediocre and falling apart. Maybe my mistake was ordering takeout instead of eating in or maybe I ordered the wrong item but I was very disappointed and felt a bit ripped off at the price. Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Enough selections so you can get your money's worth with all you can eat, without getting bored.
Nice ambiance and service, great food!"}
{"text":"I really like this place since I have eaten several times here after moving to the SW part of Las Vegas from San Diego. The 8 out of the 10 times I have eaten here the food was really tasty. The service is friendly and somewhat prompt if they're not busy. They have a good HH so make sure to pay a visit if you want to save some cash during lunch. I did have bad oysters last time I was there but they took them back and the rest of the AYCE was wonderful. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place, I get the all you can eat for $25 and end up eating at least $40 worth of sushi and the sushi is really very good. I see this place becoming a regular spot of mine."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have AYCE!! Order the tuna Karai, screaming orgasm, or sashimi's they are outstanding. They have such a friendly staff. I love coming here with my husband on date nights and he always orders the Joe special, why try to fix what's not broken?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and LOVED it. The chefs started bringing all kinds of stuff out as soon as we said AYCE.  Amazing flavors and great quality.  A Must try :)"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi joints in town, for the value.  Always fresh and always tasty.  Some variations on rolls depending on the chef preparing them, but overall good.

Have eaten here about once per week for the past 2 years.  Never disappointed yet."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of bringing our parents in for dinner on Thursday evening . My father in law is a sushi fanatic and has only been to one AYCE in Las Vegas. We showed him why sumo sushi has become our favorite sushi restaurant in town. As we all enjoyed the huge selection of different dishes including the amazing app menu, we couldn't help to notice even with a semi filled restaurant, our server was as on top of everything. Our ice tea was never empty, and was very prompt when the nigiri we ordered was up . We never waited more than 10 minutes for our orders and were asked if we needed anything else every time. Our server always had a smile on her face , even while running to cater to her many tables. My mother in law is a foodie and is kinda tough when ordering, she was nothing but pleased at all her choices. The green lip mussels are my father in laws favorite, he stated that they were the best he's had. All in all, great selection of sushi, cozy atmosphere and probably some of the best service in any sushi restaurant in the southwest! As a chef myself, I'm very picky about the restaurants I review and have not given many 5 star reviews. This is definitely worth once of those reviews."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place until now? This is probably my favorite ayce sushi spot in Vegas. Fresh sushi and great atmosphere! The service was awesome as well. I'll be coming here for my sushi fix from now on"}
{"text":"Really good sushi!! Wished the menu had actual pictures of what roll you want to order haha...I'm a visual eater !! Would come back..but next time I don't want to be seated in the booth in the back !! It was scary"}
{"text":"What a let down, I've eaten here in the past & have never had such a bad experience until last night.

Service: waiter was hard to understand & obviously didn't understand us as several incorrect order were placed for our table. I mean seriously Age Dashi Tofo came out as ice cold tofu with green onions on it. The second? time it came out the tempura was soggy and practically undercooked with cold tofu inside yet again. Then multiple wrong rolls. We ended up just asking for a different waiter halfway thru but the food was so bad her good service couldn't help the situation. 

Food: yuck!!! Fish was not fresh. All rolls on the menu have the same 4 items, no variety at all. Every roll with shrimp tempura in it had rubbery and soggy tempura. Cucumber Salad and all cucumbers in the rolls were overripe/old cucumbers that were limp and off color. Seaweed salad had a lot of liquid in it and just tasted off. Octopus was so nasty, it had to be undercooked or something...This is my favorite sashimi to get and I spit it out.

Overall: Don't go!! I will never go again. There are sooooo many other sushi places within a couple blocks that are way worth the wait, extra block or dollar(yet almost all AYCE is the same price)."}
{"text":"I first heard about this spot from a buddy who said that Jjanga honed his skills here before breaking into his own restaurant. So, I was intrigued how similar the food was going to be. After eating here, I would say that even though I think Jjanga has the edge, this is a splendid sushi restaurant!

This place is located on the deep southwest side of town. I was surprised by how far, but I guess it's good that they are located near a lot of suburbs. I also noticed on a sign outside that they were under new management, so some of the food might have changed since Jjanga had worked there.

After walking in, I noticed everything was dark, but in a cool, modern way. The sushi bar is huge, and can hold a lot of people. One thing that kinda weirded me out is that it seems like the chefs are hovering above you as you eat due to the highness of the sushi bar center.

I ordered a lot of items, and while I thought they were pretty good, nothing was bad. The fish quality they were using was very good. I really didn't like the rice too much, it was a little too sour for my taste.

As far as apps go, the chicken katsu, octopus skewer, fresh oysters, and I thought the fried calamari were really good. I didn't care for the pork belly, ribeye steak, and grilled octopus. And I thought the udon was ok.

This is definitely a solid place, I would put it in the same league as a Sushi Mon. I would definitely recommend this spot to those living in the southwest who don't want to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain for some good sushi. This place is also a lot better than the original restaurant in Green valley. A quality place all around."}
{"text":"Ugh where do I even begin. Came here as a part of five around 5 on a Friday and it was dead with only one guy serving. I believe he was also the manager because he was wearing business formal. Now when we set down he just brought the waters and asked if we were ready...and of course we're not ready because we literally just set down, and the funny thing was when we were ready he was no where to be found even though the restaurant was empty. So on so forth the food comes out and he doesn't bring us any ginger or wasabi.. finally flagged him down and for 5 people he brings a tiny tray with one serving of wasabi and just a bit of ginger... seriously? This guy was just so bad at what he was supposed to do and wasn't even nice about it and the vibe he gave out was so bad. Had to flag him down for more waters or to order when it was dead. Food wasn't even great but his service and vibe made it worse. 


Should of gotten the hint not to come in when we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"We eat here often.  We moved to Vegas 2 years ago and had finished dinner at a restaurant next door and saw their AYCE scrolling sign in the window.  Since we both enjoy good sushi we noted we should try them some time.  Came back a few nights later and sat at bar and met a great sushi chef who has taken good care of us over many visits.  The food in our opinion is awesome, the atmosphere fine and when we sit at the sushi bar the service is great.  If you sit at a booth it can be spotty.

They have an \"Under New Management\" sign on the outside wall although we understand management changed since before we moved here...so over 2 years ago.  Probably time to take it down although I guess it brings in new folks who want to see how \"New Management\" is getting things done.

Ever since that first visit when we walk in we are greeted by name which just adds another level of service in our minds.  We have taken several friends there including some who said they really don't like sushi and they all left very happy."}
{"text":"Another spot for me and the wife. Chenga and Woody always take care of us. Great Sushi! Refuse to go anywhere else. Good beer too! Be sure to eat at the bar, thats where its at!"}
{"text":"Crap! Gross! I cant believe that some say this sushi is \"the best\" or \"top notch\". Im not claiming to be a sushi PRO, but i love me some sushi. I really dont care about the price, if the food is good but expensive i am there. Im just saying i would not eat here again even if i were to eat for free. Hopefully that gets my point across.

Want a tip. Well give Smiths sushi a try, they have changed the company that use to supply the sushi. I will pick smiths over sumo any day.

{"text":"Waited half an hour just to get a water and no one come by to take order, restaurant wasn't busy, the host came by a few times to ask if the server took my order but no one did, how do you run a place without service?!?"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. Some lady a few posts down went crazy on the fish tank, well... We come here all the time and the fish in the tank are perfectly fine. I love animals and would be so sad if any were abused. It's insane to say all those things about the fish. There is one who has been there forever who swims in an odd way and that's just how he is. Tank aside, the sushi here is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Sumos has been our favorite sushi spot for the past ten years. We eat here at least once, if not three times a week. We know the menu, and know what we like that they make. Sadly the place has been changing, and it's no longer the same. The old staff is gone, the new staff try hard but they are ALL new. Tonight we came in, and there is also a new menu. Things we've ordered for 10 years are no longer acceptable to order. One person told us we aren't the first tonight to complain. I get change happens, and businesses must shift to grow sometimes; but the right thing to do for your loyal customers was to let them still order the items they have come here to eat for a decade. It isn't our fault you changed management. We may have to find a new sushi place to frequent. RIP Sumos."}
{"text":"Second time here and just as good as the first time! Amazing service and sushi!! Only bummer is that you can't get the aj for lunch... the young sushi chef was very nice and adorable!!!"}
{"text":"Never again. Really... like I can't even believe that this place is still open and had decent reviews on here. Its under new management... but a red flag was when i realized sumo sushi 1 was permanently closed.
The food is old, and tastes awful.
I ordered a poke salad that was saturated in some type of burnt hoisiny sauce. I couldnt even force myself to eat it. When I let the waiter know he was like oh you dont like it? To which i replied.. no its not that I dont like it, its not good, like at all.... He took it away, no appologee, nothing, and we got charged for everything. 
Poor slow service and they were fully staffed and there were only 2 other tables in there"}
{"text":"I often look forward to trying new sushi places and oftentimes I wind up comparing their food, service, and overall dinning experience. At Sumo sushi 2, unfortunately, they would rank at the lowest of sushi places I would eat at. We ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI BENTO, JAPANESE LASAGNA ROLL, and CHICKEN KARAGE. The miso soup that came with the bento box was watered down (not sure but it tasted like the ones in the packet), the chicken was dry and a tad burnt, Japanese lasagna was actually good however it took 3 tries to actually get my order right (I don't like eel sauce so I asked not to put it, but off course they got that wrong too), and lastly we waited about 30 minutes for our chicken karage to come out.

Food wise I'd give it a 6.5-7 out of 10. I think they need to eliminate their menus though. They have menus on the table under the glass plus they have the actual All You Can Eat menus they provide you with. I just think it's too much and it confuses the customer. Meanwhile, service needs a whole lot of improvement. There seems to be a lack of communication between waitstaff because the two servers kept asking the same questions to us. We also had to repeat our orders to them because it seemed there was some mix up, which probably could explain why our karage took so long and when we got it it did not look like chicken strips take 45 minutes to cook. Also, I think servers need better training on the OS because we got charged multiple times and our total was nearly doubled. 

Overall, I probably will not come back here. I'll save myself the stress and eat somewhere else. I am, however, giving the business two stars because the Japanese lasagna was pretty good and the waitstaff despite everything we experienced gave us a complimentary sushi to go. But sorry Sumo Sushi 2, I was not impressed. Perhaps you guys might try going on Restaurant Impossible and ask Gordon Ramsay to save you guys."}
{"text":"The fish is very fresh although the quality isn't consistent.  Sometimes the fish will be the best in the city, and other times it will lack any flavor.  The best thing about Sumo is the Yuzu Yellowtail.  It is the one thing that I keep coming back for.  The tart juice from the yuzu gives a nice refreshing taste.  

Service here is decent.  On busy nights, the service is impeccable.  Servers will ask how the food is and if we need anything else.  But, when there are very few people, the service is very slow and inhospitable.  Strange.

Make sure to sit at the bar if you do AYCE.  You'll get more sushi faster."}
{"text":"The wait staff was horrible. We had 3 different people serve us as we dined. Each one seemed like they were in a hurry and confused each time they interacted with us. My boyfriend was drinking an Asahi and when one of the waiters gave him another beer to replace it he got a Sapporo and had to remind the waiter. Also we asked for ponzu sauce and waited a while then had to walk up to the sushi bar from our table to get it. We ordered sweet shrimp and they neglected to serve the shrimp heads that are supposed to come with it...we had to ask for that to be served too. As for the Karaage chicken it was very dry and served with just regular basic ketchup. We had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and for more than the one napkin we each got. An attentive waiter would anticipate a guests needs but this staff needs more training apparently."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  The servers are great.  The rolls are creative and great!  They also crank out the rolls fast."}

Great waitresses who were prompt, accurate with our orders and they smiled a lot. You can tell that they actually enjoyed what they do for a living. Excellent service all the way around."}

{"text":"Same owner as UMIYA SUSHI!!! Excellent food, excellent service!!! Fresh dead fish, tasty appetizers, friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back all the time when I crave sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time, the moment you walk in you will be surprised how nice it is. The food wasn't as good as it looked and the sushi was okay some of the rolls we had didn't taste like anything. The interior is very nice ill give them that but no type of customer service. We were trying to talk to our chef at the bar but he ignored us when we asked where he was from. And I felt like I was being watched while I was eating."}
{"text":"The customer service here is TOP NOTCH! There are a lot of good sushi restaurants here in Vegas, but a lot do not have great customer service. That is not the case at this restaurant. They were extremely accommodating and always ready to take our order, even with a  group of 10+. Their AYCE price is the average for Las Vegas, and totally worth it because it also includes the entrees! 

Not only that, the sushi rolls and sashimi are absolutely delicious. Fresh fish, good rice, and the side orders are also yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is straight bomb diggity!! Came by myself and was treated like royalty from the moment I walked in. All the staff is super friendly and the food oozes with flavor. I got the AYCE for $25 and asked what it includes and they told me anything on the menu! Which I was taken back by because usually AYCE has certain items that aren't included. So this was sick! I started off with the Yellowtail and Tuna nigiri and a Screaming O salad which was sooooo good! Then I got the Joes Special and the Baked Lobster Roll. The Joes special was out of this world, but I wasn't a huge fan of the baked Lobster. Just too heavy for my liking. I was already sooo full after this and then the chef made me one of his specialty appetizers. It was soooo fricken good I just wish I wasn't already so full when he gave it to me so I could eat more! All in all though, this place was top notch and I definitely will be coming back! Good news, they're open till 4am also! Drunk Munchies!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. It used to be our favorite sushi spot in town however new management just took over last month and we went to try the food and did not like the new style at all. They have completely changed the ways the rolls are made even though they are still the same on the menu. The new staff informed me that I can no longer use our stamp card for ayce which I had already accumulated 8 stamps on this year alone. They also do not engage with the customers as much and refuse to make anything out of the ordinary. When we used to go we had our favorite chefs who took care of us every time. Those chefs all moved and opened their own sushi spot which I tried last week for the first time. It was amazing! I will make the further drive to eat at the new place. It's too bad Sumo 2 had to up and change everything. We have spent tons of money there and referred it to everyone we knew."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Sumo 2( usually at least twice a week). I have been eating there for 5  years. In all the time I have been going there, I can honestly say the food it always great, and the service and friendliness of the staff is the best in town. Jjanga, ChuChu, and Ku always take great care of me with my sushi, and JJ and Derek always have the best service. I have never seen my glass empty in all the years i have been there. For anyone to say the service there is a negative 1, that just blows my mind. I have eaten at many sushi bars in town, but I have found this to be the best by far. Most of the time I go there I don't even order they just give me one good dish after the other."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. We just wanted to try the place out and ordered to go. No prices on the menu, spent 23 dollars to get a California roll and 8 pieces of sashimi. Maybe the all you can eat might be worth it, but for the money they are better options around."}
{"text":"Awful service I would give them 0 starts if I could. Asked for no vegetables with our chicken said would be a extra $1 to not give us the food it came with the Ginger and wasabi hard as a rock and rude!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!! Ok. I go to sushi places A LOT. And it was my first time dining at Sumo today, I feel like I found some treasure! Fish was so fresh and the sauce on nigiris and rolls were just the right amount. They also have no rice rolls and the stuffed tomato was a killer! Sushi chef Hideki and Ramil were so much fun and super fast, and the servers were really attentive :) also the AYCE price is lower than most places and they even have 10th anniversary discount going on. So exited I found this place! Thank you for the wonderful experience sumo sushi :)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Hubby and I have been regulars for almost 3 years. The sushi is awesome, always fresh and very affordable. My favorite is Apple #1 and Lion Roll. Chenga (sushi master lol) are so entertaining and will make sushi creations for you that are not on the menu. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I love AYCE, but will not be returning to this place ever again. On a Saturday night I can understand places being busy. We expected some sort of wait, but surprisingly we walked in and the lady gave us a table right away, however, this table was for 5 ppl 1 chair was completely torn so really 4 ppl which was fine if it wasn't right at the front door. Seems like a waiting area. To get to the point right in middle of a bite on our 2nd round of ordering the same lady that sat us asked to move us elsewhere because another party needed an extra table and apparently we were sitting at said extra table. So we graciously moved reroute to our new table we thought why don't they the the table we were being moved to instead of having to move us, our food and drinks??? Does that make sense? Nothing went well after that. 
Even though the food was good at the time  the experience made it tolerable...."}
{"text":"Excellent service and I love the chefs, very polite and take the time to talk with you. I've been at this location 3 times and have loved the food and it's been very good. The AYCE is great and they have an excellent happy hour for spirits and beer and sake.
This last visit my friend had some type of beef served on a small dish and I had a bite, but it tasted like rubber. Other than that great sushi and rolls!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent, but no matter who runs this place....is always slow and off beat.  As usual we had to remind them to bring the food we ordered.  Half of it takes forever and the other half comes super quick.  After three times of ordering the same two rolls we finally got them.  So just be advised, go for the food, the rest is not impressive."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a friend's birthday party. We got times mixed up and ended up kicking off an hour later then intended but the staff was understanding and didnt give us any annoyance or anything of the sort.

ON TO THE REVIEW!!

Sadly there's not much to report. I completely agree with everything Tony T. wrote in his review dated on 2/10/2011

The price for AYCE is still +/- 25 bucks, tax, and your basic drink isnt included. 

I very strongly would like to confirm Tony's final comment in his review about the Korean influence with the sauces. A lot of the rolls and special items were heavily sauce dependent which did and didnt work out in their advantage a few times. 

Throwing out a few things of my own:

Cucumber Salad
 - Wasnt exactly fresh and the cucumbers have been swimming in vinegar for way too long giving them a soft soaked vinegar exploding result when you bite into them

Deep Fried Baby Octopus
 - Hope octopi reproduce like it's cool because these were simply amazing. Remember that comment about heavily sauce dependent? Balance was damn near perfect

Kamikaze Roll
- Pretty much a spicy tuna with some eel sauce. To me the eel sauce was poured on top of the spicy tuna rolls and the rice soaked it up like us bar hopping on Fremont street. Personal Preference but would have been better if they sauced the plate then added the rolls

Cherry Blossom 
- Yeah the one thing i ordered and didnt finish because i didnt really like it too much. To the best of my memory the menu described it as fried soft shell crab on the outside, Krab and cucumber and other stuff on the inside, avocado on the outside drizzled with some sort of sauce. The presentation was excellent it was just beautiful to look at. It itself on the other hand wasnt exactly to my liking and it's due to personal preference not due to anything on their part. Too little soft shelled crab, too much Krab and too much sauce ended it for me. 

Baked Mussels 
- Why is it that there are ALWAYS baked mussels on the menu at almost every sushi place but NO ONE orders a plate and when the mussels come out for the one guy that orders it he gets mugged? These were great, they even took the time to remove them from the shells and cut them in half for more bite sized pieces. Also not a lot of mayo before being baked. extra points in my book.

Bacon Wrapped Asparagus
- Wait wait wait...bacon wrapped asparagus on an AYCE sushi menu?!?! I had 2 they were amazing...

Cajun Albacore
 - A bit on the salty side from the Cajun dry spice rub. Albacore was fresh 

So yeah that's about it. I would recommend this place to people who enjoy sushi without a serious love for raw fish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Vegas... And I have been to a lot!! The sushi chefs here make it an experience And always welcome me and my friends like we are some kind of celebrities. 

The food is delicious, the rolls are unique, the staff is usually attentive, but the chefs are phenomenal. 

My favorite menu items are the tuna karai, something wrong 69, screaming orgasm, lion roll, mistake roll and the choo choo special. 

Friday nights are the best, because they always do sake bombs for the bar!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This was pretty tasty for AYCE. And the price ain't bad for AYCE either. It gets quiet busy after about 6pm, but was completely dead (we were literally the only ones there) at 4:30pm. There's BOGO beer and house sake after 5pm. The AYCE menu is quite extensive and has items to please even non-sushi peeps. I had about two sushi rolls, but otherwise ordered items like the ribeye steak, oysters, shrimp, mussels, etc. All quite tasty. But never fear, the list of sushi rolls is very lengthy. Lots and lots of options. Service was pleasant and attentive. They didn't kick us out after 90 minutes either (which was the time limit according to the menu). And I even got multiple desserts too (which is the limit is supposedly one). The plum wine ice cream is very tasty. The tempura fried strawberry cheesecake ice cream was super tasty. And,of course, who doesn't like mochi. I've never before been a fan of AYCE at sushi places. This is the first one where I actually ate a LOT and truly liked it. So if you're looking for ACYE sushi, especially if you want more than just sushi, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"I took my family here a few weeks ago, and we had a really good experience. With so many selections, we always find something good, and we always find something different.  But our server is what really made the experience so good. Nate came by to check on us often, he offered suggestions, and was eager to bring us more and more. He seemed like he enjoyed his job and was happy to be there.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi spot! I come down every other week and can't stop coming down. The staff is very friendly, sushi is always fresh and savory, dessert is tasty. 10/10 every time. Try the Mexican and Playboy Roll!"}
{"text":"The best sushi ever! We go there all the time and I never get tired of it! You can seat in a bar or at the tables next to the beautiful aquarium. Prices are very good, food is awesome. Customer service is great and people are very friendly.

{"text":"Yuck Yuck Yuck. I went to Sumo with my best friend and her mom, and had the oddest experience. First off, the sushi was really awful. The appetizers were good, especially the garlic edamame. Now, I think the rest of our mistakes can be attributed to a large language barrier between us and our server, but we got the wrong saki, wrong drinks, just a lot of \"wrong.\" Apparently it's under new ownership but the best part of the meal was easily the Kirin Light."}
{"text":"We took a friend here for his birthday. The service was outstanding, sushi was fresh, prices were good and we used a gift certificate from restaurants.com so it was very reasonable. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Both food and service are improved under new management! So far the best AYCE in southwest area."}
{"text":"If anyone has gone to sumo sushi 2 when they first open & compared to now. then you should know that sumo sushi 2 has completely changed. Before, this place never had AYCE, it was just mainly al la carte. They had the freshess fish that it tasted so amazing. until one day, lawwwds knows what happen!!!! everything had changed. im talking about the workers, the fish, and the customer service.  we tried the AYCE one day for the first time, and it was not impressive at all. fish was very chewy. there tempura batter was not even cooked all the way, even our favorite roll that we use to get did not taste the same and was disgusted. Not only that, they purposely make the rolls so big that they want you to be stuff from it that you won't order anything else. 

one word \" DISLIKE\""}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and parents on New Year's Eve, and we all ordered the AYCE for the variety. The service is great, and the food is decent, but there is a BIG caveat: my mother and I both got food poisoning. My father and wife, who didn't eat any uncooked food, were fine. I've never gotten food poisoning at any other sushi place in Vegas, so unless you want to take the risk, I recommend checking out another restaurant for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few sushi places in Las Vegas, and this one I've enjoyed the most! I always bring my boyfriend with me (who lived in Japan for 5 1/2 years) and he always says the rolls are just \"ok\". This place he said after taking 2 bites was not only delicious, but it's now his favorite place in Las Vegas. It's mine too! I can't tell you the names of the rolls I posted because the sushi chef asked what we liked and whipped something together that just exceeded our expectations. He's the chef that when you walk in and you're facing the sushi bar, is on the right. I believe his name is Bento. Every roll is amazing and he adds his own creative twist to give you something you haven't had before that's amazing! I will bring everyone here from now on!

I haven't had their AYCE sushi yet, but I'll probably write another review when I do. I know their prices look pretty reasonable. $20 for lunch and $25 for dinner. All I know it their tempura ice cream is great too! We had their strawberry cheesecake flavor."}
{"text":"7/19: I came here for my good friend's birthday party. It was pretty fun and the food was awesome. All of the nigiri were kind of plain and not crafted very well, though still decent. Red Rock Roll tasted good, and the presentation was unique and very bright. My favorite dishes were the Teriyaki Chicken, Salmon Collar, and I forgot what the roll was called, but it had japaleno peppers on top. I had a bunch of other stuff; forgot all the names, but they were all good. 

The pics of the food didn't turn out too great; I was occupied eating and having a good time :)

I'd give most Las Vegas AYCE food quality ratings 3.5 to 4 stars. Overall rating really depends on the service, which more often than not is sub-par. This particular place was an exception; nothing spectacular, but above average and our waiter filled up my glass for the most part. I'd revisit if someone wants to try it out."}
{"text":"I tried this place a while back. I  stopped going because well there is Sushi Fever ( yummers)   If im going to spend that amount of money on a meal i would like to walk away satisfied. The service was pleasant but  i could not find one thing on my plates ( i had AYCE) that i would have to go back for. There are too many eateries to enjoy in that area. Step your game up please and thank you."}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food came out quick.We had a few sushi rolls and fried pot stickers.Everything looked super clean and the fish tank was super cool.To be honest it wasn't my favorite sushi but good value for what you pay for:-)"}
{"text":"Sumo Sushi declined to use my Restaurant.com coupon stating that all you can eat is a promotion and therefore does not qualify. I printed the coupon that same day and there was no mention of not being able to use it for all you can eat. The owner should honor these obligations and has chosen not too."}
{"text":"Super fun, interactive sushi chefs when sitting at the sushi bar! Jay's Burrito is my favorite. Very nice prices for good sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm really digging this place. I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. I'd been here before (previous owners years ago), and I wasn't terribly impressed by the service. 

Tonight I was blown away. 

For starters, the servers and sushi chefs are really cool and energetic (I'm not a fan of sushi dudes who act like angry Portland baristas). 

Also, the service is so good, it's almost obnoxious. Three people stopped to (enthusiastically) take our drink order. Plus, the empty plates were taken almost immediately. 

Now the food. It's fantastic. Mike ordered the Crazy Boy (which should be called crazy white boy, because it's obviously for gringos) it's a charming twist on a California Roll. I was most impressed by the Snow White roll, various forms of spicy crab with white tuna on top. Kiss of Fire roll was good too, but it's not caliente enough for me. It should be called Gentle Kiss of Fire."}
{"text":"This WAS the spot for our family for AYCE until our last visit. I know there was a change in management/ownership at some point in the last few months so I'm not sure if that is it but nonetheless, the restaurant and quality of food/service has changed a lot! 

First, the portions of the plates on the AYCE menu have either shrunk or the plates they serve it on have gotten bigger. Second, coming from a family who is a coniseour of fish (raw and cooked) the quality of the fish is definitely not as fresh. 

The service was for lack of better words confusing. They had maybe 4-5 people on the floor but only one was allowed to take orders?!? It took a long time for us to place our second round.  They kept saying she will be right with you. During our first order my son had ordered a California and Philadelphia roll, all of our food came out and after we asked about it they told us oh its coming right now. About 8 min later the rolls came....my family is in the F&B industry and we can tell when an item was forgotten to be placed. So just be honest and tell us you forgot to place the order it will be out soon vs. Oh ya it's coming right now. 

Lastly, when it came to paying let's just say that was the last straw. I am really disappointed too since we did frequent this place ALOT. Have filled up numerous stamp cards over the last year or two."}
{"text":"Good service, nice folks, but the sushi smelled fishy and upset my stomach, the rice didn't stick together well or have a good taste.  I won't be eating there again, been a year since I had sushi and was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Food is good, Menu has changed, we kinda like the old menu more. There are server issues there. If you are lucky enough to get the hispanic lady, think name on check said Rosario... she is awesome. only time we have  a good experience is when she is there. Guy , we think is the manager. we can do with out."}
{"text":"First off, I do have to admit that I am somewhat of a sushi-snob.  I went here once... and have not gone back.  The food was okay for a Korean owned sushi place, however, what turned me off about this place the most was the customer service.  The sushi chef my boyfriend and I had ignored us half the time and when I asked for ooba (japanese mint) to be placed in one of my rolls he said that it would be an extra charge.  That's fine and all, I really don't mind that, but when one of my friends who is Korean told me that he went to this place and they didn't charge him for extras it really got me upset.  I think consistency is a key component when building a clientele base and this restaurant is definitely not adhering to that policy with their sloppy rolls, heavy rice, and selective customer service.  For the price and quality of fish, it is definitely not worth the 5 minute drive up Warm Springs.  I would opt for Sushi-Mon (in Silverado Ranch, not Sahara) where the chefs are friendly, the fish is good, and the portion of rice is small (even for all you can eat)."}
{"text":"Jumped in for 15 minutes to have 2 orders of Uni with quail egg. I asked the sushi chef, Paul, if the Uni was fresh. He let me try it before ordering to make sure it was to my liking. A true gentleman. And the Uni that he prepares was fantastic. Thank you Paul."}
{"text":"Awesome, yummy, great price for the AYCE, great atmosphere, attentive staff- creative, friendly chef Woody totally took care of us!  The fish was incredibly fresh, so light and pure- the sauces were great- and I love it when you can say \"just make me something\" and the chef is excited about it!  Sit at the sushi bar - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place . We don't go to any other sushi place in Vegas... The food,sushi and the employees are always awesome . I recommend everyone that loves sushi to come here !!!!"}
{"text":"Are here last night for AYCE with the wife and some friends.  I've been searching for a decent spot around me and most of them have failed or not met my standards. Sumo was definitely not one of those! We were seated immediately and the environment was very nice and private. There was some fun music videos playing on the screens that kept us entertained through our meals. They have a very large menu that did not disappoint. If you want an amazing tempura roll, go for the touch down. That roll was amazing and I'll be going back for it again. All of the rolls were great and prepared quickly for us. My friend ordered a bowl of ramen and said it was horrible, but I didn't have any plans on getting ramen at a sushi joint anyways.  I highly recommend this place and if you have room for dessert, get the tempura strawberry cheesecake ice cream to finish off your meal."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating coming here since I moved right up the street, I had visited the Sumo Sushi on Green Valley a long time ago, and it was amazing. This restaurant can't hold a candle to the original. The 1st most important part of a sushi restaurant is the foods quality. Their food was superb. The 2nd most important is the SERVICE and experience, which was TERRIBLE for a number of reasons. Eating at the sushi bar is supposed to be fun to interact with your chef, ours had no personality and couldn't explain anything correctly. There were maybe 6 people in the entire restaurant, and we had to get up to get our waitress to order. She forgot one persons beverage and then also one of our friends wanted to order off the menu, we had to flag her down for that, where as the sushi is fast since he is right in front of you. I have eaten at almost every sushi bar in Vegas seriously, and this was bad service at its finest. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow server will tell you someone will help you and nobody come...service is slow? Maybe they just don't care."}
{"text":"Sumo Sushi 2 was once one of my favorite sushi spot. I prefer them over 808 Sushi right around the corner. It is a solid sushi spot. I haven't been back for a while just because there was always another sushi spot that I just I had to try. We was kind of getting tired of sushi spots in our current rotation so since we haven't done Sumo in a while we found ourselves wanting it. 

So whats new? One there's new management, at least thats what the huge sign outside said. I've also heard some of their sushi chefs have moved on to other things. Now they were showing KPop!? music videos on a screen at max volume which took away from the nice chill dining experience I use to have here. Actually I'm fine with watching KPop music videos. Got kind of use to it once the food came. The food was also different maybe better at some things, still overall good.

I took a lot of pictures and ate a lot.

Salmon Kama http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=5gQymPRJ_OHAYfCkKe1aIg#oFq2FNb4K5Nt8d_kmUmfpg I've been kind of addicted to kama lately and been loading up on it when I eat AYCE sushi. Here's a pic from another visit http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=5gQymPRJ_OHAYfCkKe1aIg#5gQymPRJ_OHAYfCkKe1aIg It wasn't the best I've had but for AYCE kama good. It wasn't burnt or dry. It was moist, a little oily, but seasoned and cooked right to my liking.

Seared tuna sashimi with AJ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=zBPEH8qHCtNFmMTsmJ5fQQ#0M9w-iCtyw3iehNTrw9Gew Not a great picture but this is one of the items you can only order 1 of, I liked it a lot. It's only a few pieces of tuna sashimi but the AJ sauce is tasty and can be used as a dipping sauce to other things.

Nigiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=zBPEH8qHCtNFmMTsmJ5fQQ#zBPEH8qHCtNFmMTsmJ5fQQ No complaints, all were good quality and made right. I pretty much have had them all and enjoyed them all, the garlic tuna, sweet shrimp, hamachi, yuzu hamachi, uni, salmon, etc. Just go down the list when ordering. I don't think they had tamago which I believe I tried ordering and don't remember if I had it. Everything was sushi grade.

Rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=kx9Vu5iwq3RKSceA4B7HIg#kx9Vu5iwq3RKSceA4B7HIg Their rolls are excellent. Everything I ordered seemed fresh, didn't fall apart when I picked them up. They have rolls without rice and ones with lots of fish inside and out.

There's also who's your ex-wife, screaming o, oysters, agedashi tofu, mix karai, tonkotsu ramen. Again enjoyed them all. They usually have special item that are included on the AYCE menu or not, just ask.

Desserts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sumo-sushi-2-las-vegas?select=u-0Qua2JPatyR4RFuYeF8A#u-0Qua2JPatyR4RFuYeF8A Always make room for it I liked the green tea and red bean ice cream, tempera fried ice cream, and mochi ice cream.

Still have their nice aquarium with fish swimming and still nicely decorated interior with booth, tables, or bar dinning. 

Open til 4 AM always a good thing.

Still one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots."}
{"text":"Came in about 2:45PM today.  We had some good rolls, the Banana Roll was pretty good but best served as a dessert.  Taste of Fire I loved.  The other rolls were ok, like the Hawaiian roll which fell a little flat; as in bland.  We had the AYCE which was a good price, but the \"Fresh\" oysters were certainly not fresh, in fact pretty much on the verge of un-edible: very fishy.   The Red Snapper was the same way.  I would come back here if I had to, but it wouldn't be my first choice because of the quality of fish.  Service was fantastic though, chef's were very nice and the server was extremely attentive; great job guys!"}
{"text":"Visited with a few friends because it was close to home. Food and service were both okay. In a town where there's a vast variety of AYCE sushi places this one didn't really have a wow factor that would make me want to return on a regular basis. I might stop here again if I wanted something quick without having to drive too far."}
{"text":"\"Under new management\" usually is code for \"flailing widely please come back!\"
However after being talked into it by my girlfriend they won back a customer.

The service was perfect; from the friendly wait staff that checked in often to the upbeat sushi chef.

I wouldn't rank this as top tier sushi but it was the 25$ AYCE Dinner that is great. I can't say much about their roll since I'm a nigiri guy but they looked good

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Went here again for lunch to get a few rolls, and the food was amazing as usual! The lunch menu is a great deal as well as the all you can eat menu. The sushi Chefs  are awesome. The sushi is very fresh!"}
{"text":"Simply the most all-around satisfying (service + food + atmosphere) sushi experience I've ever had. A friend and I were visiting Las Vegas from Chicago and drove out to \"the burbs\" (sincere apologies to locals, but to us that means anywhere more than a mile or two from The Strip or Fremont Street) to meet friends who live in town. This was their go-to sushi joint and they promised us that the weekends were when this place really shines.

We passed through the door and you would swear that our friends were royalty. The waitstaff and several of the sushi chefs erupted in welcoming shouts and quickly escorted us to our seats right alongside the sushi bar.

Before I could even get my bearings, we were nearly instantly inundated with wonderful-looking maki rolls, tall bottles of Sapporo, sake bombs and what I can only describe as the most hilarious PG-13 sushi chef live performance that fell somewhere between Coyote Ugly bar antics, a Japanese game show and an amateur striptease. We were literally laughing off our seats and couldn't get enough (we have the cell phone videos to prove it!). If the food were just OK, I still would have loved this place, but I'm a sushi lover and this place delivered flash AND substance!

After a whirlwind 2-hour experience, we whisked ourselves out of Sumo Sushi 2 absolutely stuffed and absolutely happy. I can't wait to visit Las Vegas again and stop by this nondescript little strip mall sushi joint again. In one visit, it instantly became one of my favorite stops in town!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I just found my new sushi spot.  The quality of the fish is good, the chefs are fast and honest, love to have fun while you eat, and the best part of it all is the $26 all you can eat.  For having the quality of fish they serve at $26 AYCE is a pretty good deal considering most rolls at places are $12-16 for their specialty rolls and $5-9 for a 2 pc order of nigiri.

Another great thing about this place is that they are open until 2am now."}
{"text":"I wish this place was in LA right next to my house. Going to visit every time in Vegas. So good AYCE. Sushi, rolls, soup, noodles, teriyaki, fried rice. We tried several of the AYCE's in Vegas (not in a hotel) and this is the best. New management! Great stuff PLEASE keep it up! Oh and this is a family/kid friendly place, with TV's for sports!"}
{"text":"Once again, my boyfriend is making me give a restaurant 1 star higher rating than I would like.  But either 4 or 5 stars, this place rocks and you will always find great sushi and extremely friendly staff.  My only complaint is that they do not offer all-you-can-eat (I am from a town that offers this everywhere, so I am spoiled and quite bitchy about the prospect of a place not offering this buffet option) or any sort of discount/special.  If you like spicy crab or salmon - and let's be honest, who doesn't? - you have to try their Stuffed Tomato.  It is so good that even first time sushi eaters will be impressed.  Never had a bad experience here and I've eaten here often.  Goooo Sumo!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi place!  It's the first that I've been to in Vegas and I was more than satisfied!  Not only because of the price ($20.95 for lunch/$25.95 for dinner), but also because of the quality of the fish, and the fact that they didn't pack on the rice in the rolls/nigiri.  Back home in Cali, no matter where I've gone (except my one fav place that's been out of business for at least 6-7 yrs now) they try to fill you up on rice and the quality of the fish isn't exactly the best.

There's quite the selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even dessert!  Even if you don't plan on eating a lot, just ordering a couple of rolls will already pay for itself!

I was about to starting listing all of the nigiri that I enjoyed, but everything that I had was great!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW! My boyfriend and I are EXTREME sushi eaters! Our favorite sushi dining spot is Sushi Roku @ Caesars. We have tried many many sushi restaurants in Vegas and always compare to Roku and NONE have come even close until Sumo 2!!! The Korean female sushi chef was amazing. The fish OHHH SO FRESH!! We will be back...again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, the last time for the holidays, and every time it's fresh and delicious! I have the chef recommend some sushi so things are a surprise. I've been able to try some very unique sushi combinations that were all really great.

I like their nigiri and rolls. I'll also order a couple friend dishes liked the baby octopus... yum! The tuna or mixed karai is amazing. They must put crack in there! It's so good!

The fish is very fresh and menu selection wide. They have a ton of different and unique rolls and a lot of other dishes liked gyoza, steak, soup that are all included in the AYCE price. There might be a time limit but I'm sure it'll be plenty time for you to get full.

Service is great, atmosphere nice and people very friendly.

I highly recommend for sushi lovers and beginners!

Mmm... writing this review made me hungry for some sushi! Arg, can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We visit a friend 
And she pic up takeaway 
Food 
And it is wow wow wow 
Very good tuna poki (;"}
{"text":"Very nice little sushi spot. I opted for ala cart rather than all you can eat.  When I try a new place, I go basic to see how well they make the easy stuff. California roll, spicy tuna roll and steamed pot stickers.  All was very good. The spicy tuna particularly good with a great ratio of meat over vegetables. The potstickers were beautiful. A very filling lunch. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My favorite ayce sushi in town, and trust me i have tried them all!! Recommend seating at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs are amazing and everything comes out super fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive to the needs of the customers every time I come here I find myself more impressed. The food is good for both sushi and non sushi lovers. Personally I am a sushi novice and I leave full."}
{"text":"ok so im gonna make this quick cause i've had a few glasses of wine and im tired and full :) but i like this place.....maybe its because its really close to my house but i just dont see anything wrong with 25.99$  all you can eat .....so ok some of the rolls are an acquired taste like the pink lady (aka vag***a roll)  my bf left with an upset stomach because of that one but he's not a big a sushi fan as me ......the plum wine is basically like alcoholic koolaid but its good and it helps if you are ordering some of the spicy rolls.....they do start to slow roll you towards the end (there was 5 of us and we prob ate about 300$ worth of sushi) ....when i eat sushi im looking for creativity and freshness and this place has both as far as i'm concerned....they do have other items on the menu if you have someone who is not adventurous in your group.....the service was good ....casual atmosphere.... this would be the 3rd time i've been there and i havnt been disappointed yet .....im no sushi snob so i dont know how much validity my review has if you are..... BUT  i did live in la for 6 years and have been to some of the REALLY GOOD sushi places so maybe that helps lloll.....if you want good sushi at reasonable prices then go to sumo sushi ok....just for a price reference 3 people AYCE (all you can eat) a bottle of plum wine and a 22 ounce beer was 110 for a good sushi place i think thats a reasonable price if anybody has better for that price let me know! :)   goodnight!"}
{"text":"Small portions lol not recommended for pregnant women ! The worlds smallest avocado rolls with big prices everything g was small portions"}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend live in the SW area and frequent a number of sushi bars.  By chance we had not actually gone to this particular sushi bar until today at lunch.  As normal with all sushi bars, we are asked if we want the \"all you can eat\", but were more interested in lunch specials and were seated at a booth.

 We ordered a bento box and a sashimi platter and waited... and waited.  We watched as the people were up at the rail getting served by the sushi chef.  New folks would sit at the rail and get served and yet we just sat waiting.  As we were getting up to walk out after approximately 45-min, the waitress brought out our food.  
Concerning the sushi, they made a mistake on the girlfriend's order (spicy tuna instead of regular) and they quickly redid it, but it was loosely wrapped and falling apart.  The salmon teriyaki was ok, but there was something \"wrong\" with the tempura.  It was almost soggy.  The miso soup was probably the worse we have ever had at a sushi restaurant.

I would recommend going to one of the many other sushi restaurants in the SW area!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a bunch of times and can never seem to spend less than $150 (two people) because there are so many great things on the menu. No, it's not the freshest sushi but they do well with the quality offered.

My wife is partial to the miso cod which is usually very dependable and we've found that they are generous with the cuts of fish in the sashimi platter. My tip: order another roll or cocktail and pass on dessert - I'm pretty sure these are pre-packaged."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner last night. Had the AUCE sushi and everything was great!! Must try the Tuna Karai and the Orange Blossom."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, and even better sushi!  My husband and I ordered the \"all you can eat sushi\" and everything we ordered, from tiger salad to multiple appetizers and a variety of sushi. Everything was amazing and there are so many options to choose from.   10/10 will visit again."}
{"text":"The customer service was very friendly. We were greeted immediately upon entry. The all you can eat menu has a lot of options. $25.00 for all you can eat dinner is a very excellent value especially for ones who can feast like kings. 

The presentation of each plate is A+. The quantity A+. The quality B- almost a C. 

On the menu for AYCE a lot of the sushi rolls stated they had crab in them. I asked if they used real crab and was told they use imitation crab and they also use imitation lobster. That was a huge disappointment. Most places that use imitation crab spells crab with a \"K.\"  It is very misleading to state crab on the menu if it is an imitation. The portion size is huge. I did observe that they fill a lot their rolls with imitation crab to make each roll full. I could only each two rolls and that was because I forced myself. One roll made me full. 

I did leave room for dessert and that was the best part. I love the ice cream Mochi, red bean ice cream and fried tempura ice cream. I also had the green tea and it was not very good. 

It is a very nice place. The decor is Japanese theme  and the service was very attentive. But I gave 3 stars because the quality of the food was ok. By far I Love Sushi in Henderson is the best sushi place in town. It is not AYCE but it's best to pay for quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Love it here. Fourth time here and it gets better every time! Eric is awesome and provides excellent entertainment. Great Sapporo! The chefs are very welcoming!"}
{"text":"I went there few days ago we sat by the bar and the chef that was making our food was not friendly at All in the contrary he seemed upset that was making our food maybe he was not but that is the impression we got from him it made us very uncomfortable. The waitress was very nice but  The sushy? I had better. I was not impressed with this place we are not going back."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with amazing service!  Jjango is one of the chefs and he is incredible!  We used to frequent Oyshi but due to their poor service we tried out Sumo Sushi 2 on two friends referral and it was the best switch we ever made!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place. Its literally up the street lol...but that's not why I like it so much...I always get all you can eat and my fave is Stuffed Tomatoes... I wish I can keep reordering it though...soo bomb!!....timing is pretty average but then again I don't have the patients when it comes to sushi lol"}
{"text":"If JJ is your only choice of waiter, turn around and leave. He's a total asshole, and can't handle more than one table. I also wasn't please when he asked my friend if she was serious when she told him how much she wanted of each item she was ordering. It's like \"Fuck you, man, it's all you can eat, and she's hungry; back the hell off.\" 

Now, that said, the sushi itself was pretty good. I got the Kiss of Fire, which was sorta tasty, but nowhere near as spicy as advertised, the Mistake, which was EXCELLENT, a Philly hand-roll (which tastes the same wherever you get it, so..) and the Tuna Naruto, which is AWESOMELY light and delicious. That roll is definitely a keeper. My friend ordered the Crunch #2 (and when she asked for cream cheese on it, JJ wanted to charge her an extra dollar per roll, which isn't how any other AYCE place I've ever seen works.) and loved it. 

So, food four, service negative one, but I'll give higher weight to the food."}
{"text":"We stopped by yesterday and recieved the best service and such Amazing quality sushi. I have to say this is my new favorite sushi spot. Its a bit out of the way for us but it was soooo worth the drive. We will be back again real soon!"}
{"text":"Super noms! Try the baked salmon roll. Friendly fun atmosphere. Everything was really really tasty."}
{"text":"If it could be 10 stars for Yelp! reviews, that is what we would give this Sushi restaurant. We have been coming here for more than 1 year now and recently have been going once a week! Absolutely love the All You Can Eat menu. Pricing is reasonable and the variety on the menu is awesome. Where else can you get prime rib appetizer, fried rice, any and all sushi rolls as well as desert and drinks for under $27 (for dinner) per person?! Best bang for your buck. Staff is friendly and attentive. Sushi chefs are constantly preparing your rolls and everything is always fresh! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Last night me and my husband went to eat sushi since we live in the area and I saw the NEW MANAGEMENT sign. Here is my brief input: the place is upbeat they play good music and it is pretty busy with good prices but as soon as you check out my photos you can clearly see why my husband decided NOT TO EAT here. I was super-hungry so I just ordered 2 small plates. We spoke to 2 servers about our issue and the first one said he was very sorry but he couldn't change the tablecloth for us and when the 2nd server who we checked out with she just said they will be changing it...but I wonder when...anyway I will never return. This place is dirty and I cant imagine what else is going on behind the scene if they get away with the tables being disgusting."}
{"text":"The only reason why I came to this place was because my usual sushi spot (808 sushi) was closed due to change of hours. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and kept up with anything we needed, however, it took almost an hour just to get a few things we ordered. My husband and I spent most of our time there waiting for the food. I've been to many sushi restaurants and this place had to have been the slowest when it comes to bringing out the orders by far. The sushi wasn't the best either. This would be the first time for both my husband and I to get stomach aches after eating sushi. The fish did not seem fresh at all, as if it were sitting out to dry. Although I liked the private set up and how friendly the staff were, we will not be returning. I would prefer to not have to wait a long period of time for sushi that tastes like it's been sitting out."}
{"text":"Needs more sushi chefs.. They have been in and out of new management and upon that, things have changed. When you get the stamp card, they don't give you that last meal free like they do at Red Robins. You have to go in the following visit, which sucks ass because they were a first to do this ever that I am aware of. I loved coming here, but when you have some waiters that are too slow, it is horrible. Hopefully a newer management takes over and takes that place back to the top like before..."}
{"text":"definitely returning when i go back to vegas.

the sushi was really good. very fresh and as alot of people mentioned earlier, some were very creative. 

the main reason we tried this spot was that it was conveniently located 1 min away from the house lol. we were pleasantly surprised to find out that it was really good as well.

we had the \"i did your ex wife\" = a bunch of stuff in a jalapeno and deep fried. this was by far my favorite dish this time. i just wish they had a bigger portion.

the gf had the japanese pizza. it took forever and a day and wasnt really that great but still worth a try.

overall this place was a little pricey but worth it when you need that sushi fix."}
{"text":"Some people say AYCE places are on the way out, I disagree Sumo 2 is the best in the city. Fast fresh and friendly."}
{"text":"The waiter was so difficult to understand and made it very hard to know what we were getting. The sushi was on par with other AYCE places. The pepper tuna roll was fantastic. I would return just for that. Over all, bad service and but decent sushi."}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Might be my favorite Sushi spot.   Sign says under new management.  Not sure how they are related to the Sumo in Green Valley which is pretty good.  This place has great service and we were given plenty of attention.  I drank about 8 glasses of iced tea and they never let it run out.  That is a big deal to me.  Food was excellent and hit the spot.   Time for a nap."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town for several reasons: The food is consistently good, the service is always impeccable, and the AYCE menu offers a vast array of appetizers, salads, rolls, nigiri, and dessert. I had a couple of girlfriends in from out of town and they claimed the sushi was very fresh. Most of the specialty rolls are delicious. My favorites are the the riceless rolls, though the rules of AYCE only allows each person to order 1 of each. I only gave four stars because of the numerous rules the restaurant has on the AYCE and how strict they are. I believe between the four of us, we had ordered 12 rolls, miso soups, gyoza, rib eye, a bowl of ramen, and fried rice. We stuffed ourselves to a miserable capacity and had to leave 2 pieces of sushi. We were charged for the entire cost of the roll in addition to the four AYCE. Order what you can fit in your stomach, though, and you are set. Oh, and they play all-girl group Japanese pop music videos that are so mesmerizing that my friends and I barely spoke to one another. When we did, it was to comment on the videos. Great place."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with Sumo Sushi, for we called yesterday and asked about their working hours. They replayed that they will be open until 9pm. My wife and I invited  all all relatives, about 7 of us and headed to Sumo. We got there just about 8:45pm and for our disappointment they turned us way, stating that they were closed.  I felt betrayed by their sense of responsibility on given the right information to their customers and refusing service knowing that we called before going there. No good practice of businesses. Please next time if there will be next time. Be honest..,very simple"}
{"text":"False Advertisement: hours of operation are false. My boyfriend & I went in one night around 1 am  we got the AYCE & within half an hour they said last call!!! Wth your bright lights outside said til 4 am! The food was 'alright & as we were finishing up the waitress asked for the tip! Really!? Who does that!!?"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite. Spicy edamame is just right. The best nigiri I've had. The yuzu yellowtail is so tangy and the garlic tuna is just delicious. And the Ahi Poke my God, so perfect. So much better than I expected. Fresh fish, and good size portions, the only con I can find about this place is that they give a lot of rice, but then again for the size of the cut of Nigiri they give, it's understandable. I really like the desert selection, and their green tea ice cream is literally the best one I've had, and I'm always on the search for good green tea ice cream. The only way they could get better would be if they get a speciality desert that rotates or something. The sushi chef Ramir? (Pardon my spelling) was so great, we will definitely be back. And to think we drove by so many times passing them up on our way to Oyshi or Jjanga, when this place was there all along. Don't make the same mistake as us, definitely stop and try them out!"}
{"text":"I went here around midnight with my boyfriend and it was SO GOOD. This is def our new spot. 

I like that they have pink ginger (they aren't cheapos)

The service is wonderful

Mussels are a must!"}
{"text":"Vegas is known for its good eats and this off the strip sushi restaurant has been a favorite for this long time local for years. Something wrong #69 and Mixed Karai are awesome. The ambiance is trendy and cool and the sushi chefs are fun and social."}
{"text":"Came  hear and left. I was taking my 6 year old to dinner. I initially asked waiter how much for a six year old? They said same price as adult. I don't think so. My 6 year old is not going to eat same as me. Didn't get to try them :("}
{"text":"Hands down favorite sushi stop always get ayce. Live in centennial now and I make the drive"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi restaurant I have ever been in Vegas, as a local customer I would not recommend coming back to this place, three of us having AYCE, we ordered sashimi salad for our appt, fish taste like its frozen, sweet shrimp texture was mushy didn't have the tenderness like it suppose to be,most shocking moment for me was the sea urchin when the moment it's on our table I was speechless, it was blackened seems like someone dipped the whole thing in to black pen ink, and when we question regard the color of the uni he admit the color was wrong and it was not fresh and told us just don't eat it, but if you see the discoloration why would you even serve this to your customer, can server and owner be anymore careless? What makes me feel very uncomfortable is the restaurant was nearly empty but I had to ask our server to bring wasabi and ginger over three time, and not even apologized for the delay. Where are the standers of customer service? After dinning 2 of us got major diarrhea, I can tell you this's not a grade A restaurant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to this spot for a few months now. The W07 roll is amazing and the sushi chef, Choochoo keeps things entertaining. But last night we took some friends who had never been to Sumo and it was a complete disappointment. My friend found a hair in his miso soup. A bit un-appetizing, but hey, it happens. We then found two more hairs in our sushi rolls. Come on! When we notified our server, she was apologetic and had the sushi chef re-make our roll. But at that point it was hard to swallow anymore food. Not to mention, our server took forever in bringing us our bill. They were literally wiping down tables for closing, when I had to get up and seek her out to pay. If i come back, I will definitely sit at the bar where the service is ten times better than sitting at a table. Kinda sad though, this was one of our favorite places. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service and super friendly staff! Our drinks were always filled and orders were brought out in a fast timely manner."}
{"text":"All you can eat was for ~$25. I love how they have a minimum order per person of their cucumber rolled sushi due to it being really refreshing. I love shrimp tempura hands down. It was one of those days when your friend craves sushi and treats you out so therefore everything tastes great! The TVs and projectors on the wall all showed baseball during our meal. Unfortunately we ordered an octopus skewer but we never received it due to the volume of people slowly trickling in but other than that we were about tummy aching full. The Japanese music in the background was acoustic soothing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for À la cart! Had fried dumplings, a spicy tuna roll, and something wrong #2. A little more expensive than our normal happy hour at 808 around the corner. Tuna was more minced- and was a little salty. Casual dining atmosphere- VERY friendly staff! Fast and accurate. Didn't realize yelp wasn't loading while I was inside, so food photos were lost due to error. Sorry no food pics! Overall it was an okay place to stop in for a few rolls."}
{"text":"Strangely chopped fish, and excessive rice to fill you up.  Why go there when Sushi Koma isn't far away?  Tried this place once, it was a mistake and I went back to Koma."}
{"text":"You wanna know what the place looks and feels like?
-Sumo isn't a bad little spot. It's got a fairly nice amount of seating, and appears to be kept up pretty well. They also have a pretty good size fish tank that sits in the middle of the restaurant, which the kids will have fun checking out. 

Eats, how are they?
-They've got a decent sized menu, so we opted for the $24.95 AYCE. I'm no sushi expert, but if I had to guess, they were using a steak knife for some of the nigiri cuts. With that, nothing was terrible, but nothing really stood out either. If I had to make some recommendations, I'd say check out at least the Pepper Seared Tuna & Yuzu Yellowtail. Some of the rolls our table were okay, but nothing I would normally order myself. I will say they have a pretty good green tea mochi ice cream to finish off with though. 

Let's talk about service...
-Garbage! We literally had to ask for fresh wasabi SIX times, and one of those times was before we even ordered all our food...hoping it'd come out before the waives of fish. And if you want a water, you better ask 2 or more people at least 3 times each, all while crossing your fingers and hoping one of them pulls through with a glass. Oh, and let me not forget to mention that these jokers add an auto 20% grat to parties of 6 for this exceptional service. 

Potential to come back?
-Maybe if you're going to buy me lunch. Otherwise, I'd say save your $25 for something else. I don't even do AYCE that often, but this wouldn't be my first choice...or my 10th.

Yelp Rating - 2 stars - Meh!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was a bit slow. My bill was less then $25.00.  I left a $6.00 tip and for the service I was provided that was generous. I was willing to give the place a 2nd try since we always order takeout from there. I will not go back simply for the fact that the resturant added a $10.00 tip equalling out $16.00.  Capital one sent me an email alert. Simply not cool."}
{"text":"Came in last weekend with my brother. I really enjoyed the Poke Salad and Tanaki (sp?) Which was a spicy house roll. I like the way the menu is set up. It is sorted nice by type of sushi and spicy or non spicy"}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi place we have ever been to. Definitely worth the $25 a person for dinner. We sat at the sushi bar. The chefs were friendly & welcoming. The food was delicious.  Try the fried strawberry cheesecake ice cream for dessert, it was incredible! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time for AYCE sushi with my husband on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. It wasn't really busy for a Saturday night, which made me nervous. We sat at the sushi bar and so glad that we did because your sushi comes out a lot faster that way! You don't need to wait for your server to run it out to you since the sushi chef gives it to you right when they make it! The sushi was fresh and I was in love with the screaming O salad with the seared tuna. I'm not really a tuna girl, but this tuna was good. The seared tuna sashimi with AJ sauce is also delish! So after the hubs and I stuffed our faces with sushi we ordered the fried green tea ice cream and left the restaurant super satisfied.

$25 per person for AYCE sushi dinner, awesome sushi, great sushi chefs, good service, no wait... Yes please! Maybe the reason why this place isn't very busy is because people are all waiting 30-45+ mins at another place, but I'm ok with that! I kind of want to keep this place a secret all to myself!"}
{"text":"Guys! This is the first time i write review on  Yelp! 
The manager was very rude!
I was little confused about menu,when I asked him.  He was very mean,seems like he wanted to punch my face. And I was nice to him for the whole time. 
I am very disappointed! 
I was regular customer for almost 4years here. This will be the last time !"}
{"text":"Love the food here I really won't ever go to another sushi place if I don't have to but the service could be a little better/faster but still love it here.... (Ps they could turn the music down just a bit)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times as it has been one of our favorite spots. The last two times were not so good. Tonight we figured we'd give them another shot as every place has an off day. Tonight was the worst. We were seated and placed our order. We ordered several nigiri items and 5 rolls. Two rolls (the firecracker and red mountain) came out quickly. We received our second two rolls (green chili tempura and tuna naruto) about 10 minutes later. We then sat for about 15-20 minutes with no food waiting for our other items. Finally our stuffed tomato came. Instead of the usual 6pc roll, we got a 4pc appetizer. We had to remind our server of our nigiri orders. We received our yellow tail. It was dry. We were asked if we wanted anything else. We had to remind them of our seared albacore. We then received another order of yellow tail and what in no way resembled seared albacore. Sumo 2 has consistently gone downhill with not only their service but their dishes also. We won't be back, tonight was a third strike."}
{"text":"Someone actually gave this place five stars? Kill yourself.

I'd rather eat the dead raccoon from hot tub time machine than subject myself to another shitty piece of sushi from Sumo Sushi.

I'm grouping this in the same league as Inaka (Blue Diamond/Cimarron), and Inaka gave me food poisoning. I literally almost didn't make it home before I shit all over the place, and that goes for the 3 friends that were also subjected to Sumo's horror.

I liked the ambiance of the place, but I can't imagine why ANYONE would EVER eat here when Naked Fish / Sen of Japan are 5 minutes down the road.

My asshole hurts just thinking about Sumo."}
{"text":"Let's start off with service. There is service then there is being pestered .....If you don't want a server up your ass every 5 seconds asking if everything is alright then this is not the place for you.... you can be mid bite and they're asking you if it's alright .....The food is quality very good and fast ... can't say much more I live down the street I never come back"}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience in Vegas. Amazed they're still open. Over priced tiny portions. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Bought a restaurant.com certificate and went last night for dinner. Waitress informed me that they stopped accepting those certificates for all you can eat. When I told her that the cert doesn't say that, she said \"yeah but my boss decided a month ago she doesn't want to take them\". I told her that it wasn't my fault that they didn't update their restaurant.com listing and they should honor the cert. She refused and after \"calling\" the owner, she still refused to accept it. We walked out and plan on never returning. Shame on any business that doesn't honor their obligations. I would never have driven across town and dragged 3 friends without that cert. The worst part is the girl spoke very little English and just kept repeating over and over again \"I know\".  With a million great sushi places in Vegas and restaurants dying in this economy, there is no room for Sumo Sushi II. The funny thing is there were only 2 people in the place at 6:30pm when we got there. Maybe they should take the hint..."}
{"text":"I am sorry to those who I have become friends within the restaurant after years of my partner and I visiting weekly, but it seems this AYCE has made too many changes, lacks on service and food quality severely inconsistent. 

We were open minded when the new owners took over earlier in the year and do miss Choo Choo. He was always the reason for our visits as his personality was pure entertainment. They cleared the place of the old help and brought in a new crew that I warmed up to. 

The new menu was an improvement, but the service became a circus. You would have a person take a drink order and then every 30 seconds like a comedy show another person would come by and ask the same thing. Guess they do not understand sections? This did slowly go away, but now many of the servers, particularly female are pushy, rude, do not listen, and anticipate what you want rather than listening to you and getting it right the fist time. 

The food is never truly bad, but inconsistent. I can deal with the rice game, but don't serve me junk. Different days bring different people and thus different quality, different recipes, contrary to the menu and if they are busy, even with a ton of staff, hang it up as it will be a waste of your time.

Sorry again, but one good thing about Las Vegas is the ton of other sushi restaurants. Have to find a new AYCE that can get consistency and service right."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had a mediocre experience. Great happy hour with 1$ Saporos and Sake. My friend ordered a beer & it came out room temperature. It also had lipstick on it. But I understand shit happens & let's face it, you don't go to a local sushi spot for the service. 
The seaweed salad was great! We ordered the Lion Roll & the What The Heck Roll. The lion was amazing, would def order it again. The what the heck came out with all these onions, peppers & tomatoes that wasnt in the menu description. Not so great. 
The sushi chef was pretty entertaining. Over all I may return just for the Lion Roll."}
{"text":"What a really cool funky place it's such a chill environment for dinner or lunch. The staff is really friendly and helpful. The spicy garlic edamame is really, really good, best I've had. Tons of flavor and spicy and cooked perfectly. We tried the hot Cheeto roll which was so BOMB! Weird it might sound but honestly bomb! If you like spicy that's the roll to get. There food tastes really fresh definitely no chewy texture."}
{"text":"Love Sumo Sushi II 
The sushi is always the bomb!
Monkey brains make you insane. The staff remembers you no matter how much time has gone by since last visit! AYCE ..no judgement ! Happy to get whatever you want!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"At Lee's liquor and decided to call in a order.   $25 for two rainbow rolls, wtf!! Waited at least 20 minutes for my food to go and the place was empty!!! The roll was less then desirable and I didn't even finish it!!! Grrrrrr... Get it together sumo!!"}
{"text":"My girl and I were craving sushi, and was too tired to drive to our usual spot. So I decided to give this place a shot. The service was awesome, very friendly and attentive. The quality of food was to our satisfaction, but the here comes the deal breaker. With their AYCE sushi, they don't do half rolls. We like to try a little bit of everything. So unfortunately we won't be back here unless they convert to half rolls."}
{"text":"No offense but this place was pretty awful. The sushi clearly wasn't all that fresh and like others have said the rolls were sloppily made and often less than th advertised pieces. The service was also awful even though the place wasn't crowded at all. Now I guess we know why it wasn't packed. Drive the extra 5 minutes to Naked Fish and save yourself the misery."}
{"text":"I usually come here when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown. Food is decent, service is ok, just could do without the loud rap music they play. Over all not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Went there early this morning. 10 minutes before opening time. Door was unlocked, we asked for a menu and this lady very RUDELY said not open and no menu......
I guess they don't need the business.
There are a lot more Japanese  restaurants that would like our business."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with my fiancé. We have a stamp card.. So many meals get you a free meal. They have a great all you can eat menu. We prefer to sit in the booths, very private booths. Beautiful fish tank. Friendly staff. Not overly busy at the times we've come they can assist you and take your order relatively quickly. The food comes out fast. The sushi chefs know what they are doing. I also love the beautiful fish tank here!"}
{"text":"I've tried to give this restaurant a couple tries, with it being around for a couple years, always changing management but unfortunately it still lets me down. 

I give 3 stars because service was terrible when we first arrived but got better towards the end & the sushi rolls were good. We almost walked out but it was late & just wanted to eat & get home. We weren't greeted, not attentive, rude attitudes, no customer service. Our waitress took our order without writing it down, came back a couple minutes later with pen & pad to have us re-order so she could write it down. Never said thank you, checked on us once. It'd be different if it was busy & she was the only waitress but it was us & two other tables, very calm & quiet environment.

I probably won't come back unless put in the same situation as tonight where it was late, only place open & close to where I live."}
{"text":"Great sushi for what you pay. Always enjoy going here. Fresh ingredients and fun atmosphere. Service tends to be extremely slow."}
{"text":"Love this place! The music, atmosphere, staff... And above all the best sushi out of all the places we've been to in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here, the first visit was great, great food, great service. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about this time. We were seated & waited 25 minutes nobody came & asked us for drinks. This is unacceptable service. To get unnoticed for twenty minutes after entering a restaurant. I will not be back. The lady who sat us did not even pay attention when we walked out either."}
{"text":"The worst pieces of raw fish ever laid on top of rice.  The quality of ingredients were so bad I'm tempted to eat here again just to make sure I've really found the worst sushi restaurant on the planet."}
{"text":"Ordered my sushi through uber eats. Delivery was very quick but the lasagna roll that I ordered tasted very salty and wasn't that great. I'll give this place another try though..."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service is horrible. Our server hardly went to our table i have to stood up just to get his attention. Second server came and he also just keep passing by us, look at our table without even asking if we need anything! They dont pay attention to their customers. Dont waste time and money here."}
{"text":"We usually love this place and often go in to sit at the Sushi bar. We have always enjoyed great service and great food (my husband is an all you can eat guy). However, we visited here on Friday, April 3rd with some visiting family and we were highly disappointed. Three of the people at our table did all you can eat and the service was terrible. We were sitting at a table and after originally ordering, they only received part of their first orders, drinks were not refilled unless someone was flagged down, they brought the same rolls twice, and the wrong rolls. Very poor experience. If we go back, we will definitely have to sit at the Sushi bar again. Unfortunate...."}
{"text":"I hate to give them so bad a review as the food I've had so far has been great but I've now been sitting here for 45 minutes since finishing our first roll on all you can eat and the server is literally actively ignoring our table.  Wow is all I can say.  Been out of drinks for at least 30 minutes.  Never Ever coming back and the \"new management\" advertised needs to fix this as there are many sushi alternatives I would recommend."}
{"text":"I would pick quality over quantity any day. Only came here instead of fish n bowl because I wanted to try a variety of stuff. I could have use $60+ towards fish n bowl instead. My complaint is the salmon nigiri it smell nasty the color was dried red probably been sitting there in a fridge taste like fridge omg never will I come here so gross not everything but it's not worth it to me."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here however I eat sushi fairly often. The booths are enclosed which allows for some privacy and extra room if your party is small. We opted for AYCE (well priced) as we mostly do when going out for sushi. The fish is fresh and the portions a good size. The service was great and the servers were very attentive however we went later in the night and it was slow so YMMV. Overall a pleasant experience and I would go again."}
{"text":"Very good customer service. Only spent less than 40 for a bunch of food. Food was delicious! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"The AYCE is the best deal 30 bucks.Food is always great!!Never had any issues.Service is always fast and they are good. we went with a large group with a couple kids and the staff was great.Kids love the fish tank and food.I would definitely recommend going.If you have a large group call and make a reservation.Beers and sake buy 1 get 1. I will definitely return.Kids under 3 free."}
{"text":"Out of all the sushi places I have been to around the country. This by far has some of the most fresh tasty sushi there is. The service is always phenomenal and makes you feel like family. If you want amazing food with great service look no farther. Something wrong 69 is my personal favorite roll."}
{"text":"i would give it zero stars .... there sushi is of the lowest quality.... always old and nasty... service was awful... the manager is a dick and i would kick his ass in a heart beat if i had the chance"}
{"text":"Best blue fin tuna on Las Vas Vegas!  I lived and used a corporate expense account for 20 years and have eaten at some of the best Michelin restaurants in the world.  You will NOT find better blue fin tuna sashimi anywhere at Sumo's Sushi prices.  Buttery and delicate texture, almost buttery but in a good way.  There AYCE is a steal!   A quality fish at value prices. Sit at the sushi bar and ask for sushi chef Betto."}
{"text":"I always start with the screaming O salad.. Very delicious.. Every roll I've tried is very tasty and flavorful.. I have already recommended this place to my friends.. Definitely a quality all you can eat.."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe this place is still in business let alone has 3 and a half stars. Anyone who gives this place more then one star must of been payed to do so. 

Ok so we wanted to try something new its by our house and it had decent reviews what a mistake! 

We ordered AYCE because we were hungry and both wanted 3 or 4 rolls and some dessert. I ordered a lasagna roll, the crazy ass roll and the deep fried Cali roll. The lasagna roll was ok at best and that's stretching it, then came my deep fried Cali roll I took one bite and was totally disgusted!!!! The tempura was hard as a rock and just tasted wrong and the crab wasn't fresh at all it tasted nasty as if it were fake! Trying to eat this was so hard I wanted to throw up every bite I took by the 4 roll I spit it out threw up in my mouth and said fuck it id rather pay extra on top of my AYCE price then eat another bite of this roll! Oh and mind you I'm already full by now because the rolls are double the size of a regular sushi place!  If I had known that I wouldn't have ordered AYCE in the first place! So moving on, I still have my 3rd roll coming when it came I took one look at it and said I can't eat this! I was already sick to my stomach by then from their poor quality sushi! 

What a waste of our money! Me and my fiancé are both sick from this place. Worst sushi I have ever had!!!!

Please for the love of god run if you see this place just run!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sumo Sushi 2!!!!!!!!! 
O-M-G!!!!! 
FRIGGIN ORGASM!!! 
69!!!! 
YUMMY!!!!!

What happened here? My mouth and body were just trippen!

I've had some good sushi in my lifetime but boy oh boy was this place AWESOME! It always helps to know someone to who works whereever you go. It also helps to tell them what you like and let them make special things for you that are on and off the menu. MmmMMMM! I'm SOOOOO going back soon!

The first thing I had was the ORGASM. It was tuna sashimi with other things and topped with some special sauce. Whatever it was, it did give me my first orgasm and set my body up for the next orgasms as well!!!
My FAVE rolls were the 69 roll (yes 69 roll is the name) and the Tuna Naruto roll (I think that was the name). 

The 69 roll was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo good!!!!!!!!! It had this special garlic sauce that was just amazing on the roll. WOW. SO friggin good.

Of course we had sake bombs which was complementary to the rolls, sashimi, and special stuff we had. MmmMMM! 

You MUST go to Sumo Sushi 2. 
Tell them what you like and let them make you some stuff.
Be nice and hook up my buddies with some beer and sake bombs!
Have a great time and get ready for a MOUTH-GASM!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, convenient location, but service is its weakness. I would definitely order to go or take my teenage sons, but I wouldn't go back for a date or a special occasion."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this place. As long as we aren't being served by the tall guy with the glasses that I assume is the manager. Food is good, service for the most part has always been really good. I prefer eating at the bar because the sushi chefs take care of you. They leave you be until you want to order more. Their appetizers are good, most of their rolls yummy and I love the big fish tank. Prefer this place over some of the other popular places in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered all you can eat. First round came reasonably quickly and was very good. Spicy tuna, kiss of fire, couple of appetizers. Still waiting for the waitress to return for round two. Forty minutes later. Completely ridiculous and unacceptable. Will not come back and will not recommend to anybody else."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went there for a birthday celebration. Our server Tay was friendly, energetic and on top of it.  Everything that we ordered was greatly presented and delicious.  Very happy with the whole dining experience.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I love Sumo! We come here all of the time.. The food is super yummy and the staff is always super friendly! One of our favorite places for AYCE."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi 
Good customer service 
Sushi was good in taste 
My favorite sushi will be back again"}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite spot to eat Sushi! The service is impeccable, and the AYCE is absolutely worth every penny.  The fish is always fresh and the flavor is never disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go very often.  Food is great and as well as the services.  I love the AYCE menu.  Lots of options to choose from. Apps, soups, nigiri, burritos and lots of rolls.  My favorite rolls: orange blossom and Japanese lasagna.  Their garlic tuna is on point!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday, no wait to get in, and the fish is really good, really fresh baked muscles are really good, just an overall good AYCE sushi place on this side of town"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that the service here was bad based on other reviewers who rated this place 3 stars and below. If you're Gonna compare the the sushi at Smith's and here then you probably do not know what good sushi is. The service was exceptional! We arrived around 7pm with a party of 7 adults and 2 children,  We was seated right away. Our servers were prompt with our orders and there wasn't a bad dish that came to our table. This was by far the best ayce joints I've been to in town. 

Honestly I had my doubts about coming here after reading the reviews, and I'm glad I came. I knew this place was gonna be a go to spot for ayce after taking my first bite. 
The nori was fresh and crispy which is what you want in a sushi roll, not the soggy chewy ones that other ayce sushi joints serve you with. The fish was fresh and did not have any odors, if you can tell a fresh fish from one that was sitting in the cooler for days then you know what I'm talking about when it comes to what is fresh and what isn't. Being able to tell what's in your sushi also determines how well you know your sushi, just because it smells \"fishy\" doesn't always mean it isn't fresh unless you got a salmon nigiri that gave away an odor then you definitely have a problem. Which in our case the salmon nigiri was great!! Or other nigiris for that matter. 

The highlight of my night was how fresh everything was especially the Uni which blew my mind on how fresh and buttery, it almost tasted like they picked it straight from the ocean before serving it. I've had Uni at other places at it almost makes me gag and force my self to swallow it. I had no problems doing that here. 

Pros: great service and food
Cons: open till 11pm"}
{"text":"Best food and AYCE sushi place I have been too!  Amazing service. Fast and prompt service!  Fun atmosphere too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great in the beginning and after an hour of being there they kind of forgot us and kept passing our table. Other than that's I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing is an understatement. 

My sister and I visited Sumo Sushi 2 a couple of weeks ago after her efforts of convincing me for months of the great quality and innovative sushi. When we arrived, we were promptly seated in a table near the sushi bar and of course, we ordered AYCE for two. I have to be honest, I don't quite remember the exact rolls she and I ordered but I do distinctly remember ordering only 3 rolls and a few appetizers. (Now, let me put this into perspective: when my sister and I go to Umiya, we probably order 7 rolls, at least 23 orders of nigiri, and then a couple of appetizers and dessert so ordering 3 rolls and a handful of appetizers is NOTHING to us.)

To put it shortly, I feel like the biggest downfall of this place was their usage of sodium. The rolls weren't impressive because it was drenched in sauce which some tasted too tangy or too salty. We tried some of the \"special\" sushi appetizers and it was soaking wet with sriracha and soy sauce. This place is a match made in heaven for those who suffer from hyponatremia. Even though we tried to stick to what fellow Yelpers recommended, they simply didn't even come across as decent. And let me tell ya, I'm not a difficult girl to please when it comes to sushi. I think that the best thing I had was the coconut shrimp and even then, it was fried a little too much and too sticky for my taste buds.  

The food was mediocre but service definitely rivaled it. For some reason the waiter had this talent of impeccable timing to check on us when we didn't need anything and disappearing into thin air when we needed something. On the other hand, the people who were having a ball drinking sake bombs with the sushi chefs were checked up on very often. Hm, I wonder why.  

My sister was extremely disappointed as well. She remembers visiting this place a couple of months back and having an amazing experience with service and food. 

The verdict is that I most definitely won't be coming back. I don't recommend this place one way or the other and hope that they make major changes soon."}
{"text":"We landed in LAS around 7pm and headed to Susmo Sushi straight from airport. We were surprised this place is quite far from the strip. From the map, it looks like it's pretty closeby.

The atmosphere was nice, it's got flat screen TV on all side of the resto. The NCAA finals were on all every TV when we were here... Duke vs. Butler. Unfortunately, Duke won by 2 pts.

We ordered quite a few rolls! The 69 roll was awesome! it has a very unique sauce on it. The orgasm roll (not really a roll, just sashimi on it) was not bad. Unfortunately, that's the only 2 rolls we liked. We also tried what the heck roll, which was way too sweet for our taste, and another roll that's so forgetful that I dont even remember the name of it. My mom ordered unagi-ju. It has this sour taste to it, which is kinda weird cuz it's supposed to taste sweet.

If you eat here, definitely order the 69 roll, but other than that, nothing else is too special. I dont think I'll come back here again next time, esp since it's so out of the way from the strip."}
{"text":"Whoever said their service sucks, is on one. Service was on point, and Eric was awesome. Great sushi as well!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. As soon as you walk in the door your greeted an asked If you want the sushi bar or a table. Most of the time we sit at the sushi bar so we can talk to our favorite sushi chef Beto. I also love the fact that they have all you can eat on most everything for $25.00. But if your not in the mood for that their rolls are very reasonably priced.
Everything is always fresh an tastes amazing so no matter what you try you won't be disappointed. An if you you like spicy they have it an can make it as spicy as you want. I usually start with  the tuna Karai spicy an it's awesome. The steaming O is also very good an if your eating all you can eat it's on their. 
 An nothing goes better with Sushi then sake. And they definitely have their selection of that. I also recommend the spicy garlic edamame as an appetizer they are to die for especially if you like spicy. So go in an try them out. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is slow but the fresh fish makes it worth the wait. One of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in Vegas. The menu has some amazing specialty rolls (sunrise is my favorite) and the staff let's you order as much sushi as you'd like. You may have to flag the staff down but I think it's worth it for the sushi."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and we were so happy we decided to try a new AYCE spot! My boyfriend and I both went for the AYCE option, which is $25.95 for dinner time. Everything we ordered was so fresh and delicious! We eat sushi as often as we can, and our true lovers of fresh fish, and this restaurant met all of our expectations! We ordered gyoza, crispy rice with spicy tuna, mussels, and seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce for appetizers and all were delicious! For rolls we ordered the tuna naruto, firecracker, sexy roll, spicy tataki, and a spicy yellow tail. We also went for some halibut sashimi, and everything was fantastic! Another plus for all of those Sapporo lovers out there, the special they had going on while we were there was a buy one get one free 20 oz! The service itself was also spot on, our waitress was so friendly and attentive. Other service staff also chipped in too just to make sure we always had full waters and occasionally take our orders because we eat a lot  The sushi chefs got our orders our fast without our rolls looking sloppy or rushed. To sum it up, we will DEFINITELY be coming back here."}
{"text":"The best sushi spot in town.  The fish is incredibly fresh and their creativity always amazes me.  One of my favorite rolls is the Johnnie roll in which cucumber holds the roll together (in place of the seaweed/rice).  Their sushi nachos are also fantastic which includes seared tuna and avocado on a fresh tortilla chip.  The staff is excellent and incredibly welcoming.  You will really feel at home.  Sumo sushi 2 has become not only my favorite sushi spot but, a great place to hang out on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely bringing my friends here when they visit. The Korean waiter we had was friendly and knowledgeable. Try the Tiger Roll with lychee sake :)"}
{"text":"Will never return and if you care about service you won't even try this place. We were led to three different tables before we were actually seated because the host could not understand 6 plus a high chair. He kept taking us to different tables and removing the sixth chair. Then when we were finally seated they didn't give us an a la carte menu only an ayce one when asked about the a la carte menu the referred us to the menu taped under the tabletop so basically 6 of us had to share one menu and when we asked for another yet would only give us 1. Our food then took forever to come out and when it did it didn't come out all together and most of the food was already cold. The taste an quality of the food was pretty terrible.It also took a good twenty minutes and multiple request before we could get the check. The server told us she have us our drinks for free which was hilarious since most of us ordered water and then they were trying to charge us a 20% service fee for basically the worst service I've ever experienced. When I complained she said there was no way to remove it but when I asked to speak with the manager she magically returned with a bill minus the service charge. They also blast k pop music so loud that even my 2 year old niece complained it was too loud."}
{"text":"YUCK!!!!! Went there for the first time tonight and it was horrible!!! The sushi was not fresh..the Japanese lasagna tasted like charcoal.. and the food came out way fast which is probably a bad sign when ur dealing with sushi.. me and 2 friends did all you can eat and we could not even bare to choke the food down so we had to sneak n put the rest in a dirty diaper sack!!! My stomach hurts sooo bad I wont be surprised if i get food poisoning!!!!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews on anything but had to share my opinion on this place.  The food was so bad.  The fish was not fresh at all.  I felt like I had overpaid for the little food we ordered.  The only good thing was we were not charged for all the uneaten sushi on the AYCE.  I would not go back even if it was free."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious, always amazing service. I like coming here because it's very convenient for the Southwest local, but I also really love their sushi selections and Happy Hour specials. 

Thank you, Sumo Sushi!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a major disappoint. 

We decided to try this place out since we live so close to this location & we wanted to try something different as well. This is definitely one of those instances where I reaaaaally should have just listened to the reviews. 

I am leaving with a two star review, because even though we had a horrendous dining experience, most of the food we ordered was very tasteful. And the food came out very quick as well. 

Our server was HORRIBLE. He was insanely rude, to the point where it was almost condescending when he was speaking to us. I really wish they had names of the receipt because the service from him was so off putting I would've like to speak to his manager about his attitude problem. There was no reason for him to rush us through dinner either. As there was only 1 other small party. 

Please save yourself the $$$ and go to a AYCE sushi down the street. I would've like to come back & enjoy their food. However for that service & the price for it, I'd rather drive a few more miles up the road to enjoy sushi with great service."}
{"text":"They advertise on all you can eat they have lobster roll, shrimp roll but it's all grounded up imitation crab. Better served somewhere else.  Terrible. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"We eat here often it's our favorite sushi place the food is amazing and so are the people that work here just great! :)"}
{"text":"Well we went to three other restaurants before we happened upon this little sushi gem.

There was no wait and we got seated immediately. Praise the lord because we were starved!

I loved their seating! Every table was in its own little private cubby it felt very warm and welcoming. The appetizers were very yummy!

We had:

Oysters 5/5
Spicy Garlic Edamame 3/5
Coconut Shrimp 4/5
Creamy Shrimp 4/5

They had two appetizers I really wanted to try but my tummy was too full! So if you go and try the Whose your Daddy? Or the Ex-Wife let me know what they are?!

We only had a few rolls, but the ones we did try were delicious!

Dragon Roll
Sea King Roll
Bad Boy Roll
And another roll that I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the name off which is a shame because it was my favorite roll!

Of course we ended our under the sea adventure with Mochi!

The service was good but it did take a long time for the actual rolls to come out with it being dead I thought that was kind of strange but it could've just been an off night. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Bless your heart Sumo 2.  The staff are phenomenal.  Joy was our server this particular evening, and she did nothing but kicked ass. We had a party of 8 people including 3 wild boys, so thank you for being so patient with us. 

I had my eyes on the kids, so i really didn't pay much attention to details, but i do recall the decor was quite lovely with a big ass aquarium in the room.

We ordered bunch of sushi stuff for the table as well as other side dishes, but none were memorable. Even so, our sashimi were just OK at best.   We saved 50bucks from http://Restaurant.com and our tab was still $240.  Kind of made me think that we should have gone to AYCE instead after all.  Next time i won't doubt those brats lol

We went mainly for the kids since they wanted to eat sushi, so it was nice to take those rug rats out to dinner in a mature setting.  Hopefully they didn't agitated the other patrons in the restaurant because i did not have the heart to yell at the boys since they are not my own.  The children didn't eat much of the sushi stuff after a while, so we got them a bowl of udon to share amongst themselves.  Not sure if that did the trick, but it did kept them quiet for a good 5min :P

The desserts here are not worth your while other than the mochi.  Do not get the creme brulee.  It's like a cheesecake done horribly wrong. 

Verdict: kids say the darndest things e.g. \"I wanna eat sushi!\""}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in town, I must carve out time to visit Sumo.  Inside the suburban retail exterior is a hidden treasure.  The ambiance provides a delightful essence of kabuki and a slight vibe of harajuku.  The hostesses and sushi chefs are always so friendly, attentive and appreciative of your patronage.  

I HIGHLY recommend the XXX sushi roll!  DIVINE!  Also, you cannot leave without having a taste of the tuna karai.  BLISS!  As soon as I start to mouth off about the wicked desert heat, I think-- a li'l Sumo will stop my bitching in a heartbeat.  If Coach Sushi and Sumo were in the same city, I would simply be beside myself!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very down to earth and friendly environment. Everyone greets you including the chefs. Food is amazing and super fresh. AYCE is the way to go! If I could, I'd eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are well balanced...compared to other sushi restaurants who add more rice to make it look bigger. The food tasted great and the ingredients complemented each other. The ambiance is relaxing and comfortable. Great service."}
{"text":"We came today to celebrate my big brother birthday and Tiffany the waitress took care of everything A-Z 
We are very happy with the food and the overall service, highly recommended for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"The sushi is very high quality and the price is decent. It is not an all-you-can eat place but like i said before the quality is superb. Been going there for about 2 years and still loving it. Staff is friendly and entertaining. If i could I would eat there everyday."}
{"text":"Eugene was outstanding ! Best AYCE service we have received in a long time. 

Thank You. 

Food was great!  Very fresh."}
{"text":"Great place. All you can eat sushi! Delicious and creative."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUMO SUSHI 2!

It's my Favorite restaurant in Vegas - PERIOD!
$26 for AYCE!

Go with a good group of people if you want to try a variety of rolls. A huge list of appetizers are included too! Ahi Tuna... yum

Now what to eat... everything!
I remember a Johnny Roll (cucumber outside) was good and not too filling - like rice. There was a vinegared roll that also stood out. All the rest were good too. Just keep eating till you pop- you won't regret it!

- Just make sure you finish all your food or it goes to a la carte pricing!"}
{"text":"I usually love this restaurant but the quality has gone way down! 

Most of orders had something wrong with them. The unagi came out missing the the sauce and seaweed wrap.  The dynamite was burnt and didn't have any cream.  The garlic edamame was extremely burnt.   

It looked like the restaurant only had two servers. I felt bad for them at first but I didnt towards the end of the night. When we told them the problems with our food, they shrugged us off. On top of that the sushi chef gave my family a dirty look for voicing our concerns with the food. It was as if they were only interested in satisfying their customers at the sushi bar.  

I dont think I will be back for a very long time. I'm not happy at all with the way my family was treated tonight.  Save your money and eat at a sushi bar that gives good service"}
{"text":"Expensive, but I love this place!
Sitting on the bar here is awesome."}
{"text":"Ok I didn't eat at the restaurant. Our Co work Jenny brought sushi for this restaurant. Her brother owns it and I have to say OMG it is great. Now that I got a taste I'm gonna go to the restaurant  and try it with some saki."}
{"text":"If possible,  I would have given 0 stars. 
Decor isn't bad when we first entered the restaurant. We sat at the bar. That was when things started to seem odd. One of the sushi cooks offered us an order of seared tuna before we even ordered. That was a pleasant start,  but soon we felt the creepy stare of a cook. It was so uncomfortable that it interrupted our conversation. He then asked if we were of \"Asian descent\". We awkwardly answered and tried to continue with a serious conversation we were having. But he was still staring! 
There were only a few diners on a Saturday night. Yet, the service was hilariously bad. The servers were inattentive. We had to flag them down several times for each request. They had gotten our orders wrong twice. The cooks were busy having beers and chatting with a couple of guys. We were curious as to who was going to make our food.
As for the food... The very first dish we received had a hair on the sushi! That was a first for either of us. The cook we handed it right back to had an \"oops\" expression on his face. Half of the food was overseasoned/salty. 
When we opened up our Yelp app to look up this restaurant, a staff member popped up from behind us and asked if we wanted some ice cream when we had barely began to eat. He explained that he was just joking because he saw that we were on Yelp. I'm speechless. After we got our checks, paid and started to leave,  there was no one to say 'goodnight', 'please, come back again' or 'thank you'. 
Suffice to say, we're not coming back."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi! Delicious and creative rolls.
The atmosphere is beautiful and the servers are polite and fun. 
I highly recommend giving this location a shot."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was sub par, would not eat here again, if you want a more authentic sushi experience I would look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was great, second time coming here and its probably one of the best cheap sushi places in Las Vegas. But probably one of the worst service I have ever got from a server. He interrupted me as I was ordering, basically raised his voice at me trying to talk over me, walked away from me while I was still ordering, he never really checked to see if we were ok, and usually I can understand but we were one of 2 parties in the restaurant. He basically seemed like he hated his job, or he hated us(giving sarcastic tone the entire time). Food=GREAT, service= Disgrace to even be called customer service or even a server."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! Even with new management.. We've been going here since 2009!! Love the sushi's.. Best part is the spicy garlic ponzu with anything. Will definitely keep coming.."}
{"text":"I've come to sumos for years and so happy I have rediscovered it in the south west. Beto is the best."}
{"text":"Good sushi! This isn't the best sushi place I've been to but it's definitely not at all bad. It's quite good actually. Try the scallops. Real tasty."}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place! It's the only place we've tried since moving to Vegas. The service, quality and taste/freshness of the food is what keeps us coming back! Love the atmosphere, the friendly staff, and delicious rolls! Kid friendly, my 21 month old loves their Chicken Teriyaki! Love that the booths are secluded so we even get privacy while dining. Food comes fast and beautifully plated."}
{"text":"The old crew left to go somewhere else. The new crew is very friendly. I didnt realize that the hours had changed under the new crew so they had to kind of hurry us up around 1030pm. The sushi was alright, id say it was slightly better before.

If anyone has info of where the old crew headed off to, please let me know. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place advertises that it is opened until 12am. It is not. I came before 11:30pm and they would not let me in or serve me. The entire staff came out and I asked them why they advertise that they are opened until 12am and they didn't really have an answer but exclaimed that they close whenever they want. Great answer!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sumo #2 3 times now...I've tried other (more popular) places in the same area SW of the 215...what keeps me coming back is the freshness of the fish (+1 star).  The price, mentioned in several reviews posted before mine, is on par with the other places offering all you can eat sushi.  Some of their long rolls tend to be too fancy at times.  I mainly go for the nigiri and tuna karai...and I'll have an occasional long roll or two as well.

One of the bright spots of the economic disaster that hit LV is the large emergence of AYCE sushi establishments.  Overall, I have to give 5 stars, because Sumo was one of those places that started off with great quality a la carte sushi and converted to AYCE while maintaining the quality."}
{"text":"Their service sucked I've waited 30mins just to order my rolls. No one came to ask if we needed help nor even acknowledged us."}
{"text":"Quick service. Most of the food looked good. I am a sushi fanatic and sumo didn't have the best quality of fish. Although their all you can't is only $25 for dinner. I had the tuna poki and I got home was was feeling very sick. I don't think it was fresh.  My family seemed to enjoy their meals. On another note, we sat next to the large fish tank and while I was eating I saw a dead fish under in the rock cave. Not what i wanted to see. Fish was about 4-5\" long. Ewww. But the service was great"}
{"text":"Headed over to Lee's for beers, thought getting some healthy sushi. We ordered 3 sashimi and 2 sides for $40. The portions are TINY! Very very small. I understand that the product is good quality, but man. I'm a dollar a roll kind of girl, not $8 for 2 pieces!!!!"}
{"text":"In Spring Valley this is my favorite sushi place. The restaurant has a nice ambiance. There is a giant fish tank that is fun to look at while eating. Their sushi rolls are consistently fresh and pack a flavor punch. Like most sushi restaurants in Las Vegas they offer an all you can eat menu. I ordered all you can eat. I noticed that once I ordered this the waitress came by less frequently (I'm guessing so I would eat less items since there is a time limit). My other complaint is that you can only order one tiny mochi ice cream piece under all you can eat. As a mochi lover I was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a good tasting sushi place around town. This place is just like ehhhhh. Not even good. The best thing I got was the uni sashimi. That was decent but it took the win. I guess if you're not picky, come here. But I like quality and good taste. Not for me."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here.  I live in the area and there are numerous sushi options -- this place is by far my favorite!  The AYCE menu is extensive.  The service is legit top notch every time I go which is a huge factor for me, especially when doing AYCE sushi where you and your group are constantly ordering.  They have amazing cucumber rolls and their baked rolls are my fave.  They even have a punch card rewards program.  This will always be my go to sushi spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've been here a lot and this time I dunno, the food just didn't have the flavor. Something about this place has really gone downhill in the last few years, I suspect around the time they caved and started offering All You Can Eat. 

I got the AYCE while my boyfriend ordered some soba noodle dish off the regular menu. I got my usual nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, garlic tuna) which were just OK. I ordered a candy cane roll which was not that great and I ended up not eating half of it. The baked green mussels were pretty good - I like that they only bring you a small serving of the appetizers so you aren't gorging yourself. 

The fried shrimp tempura was really gross. I don't know if it is just me or what, but the panko breading just doesn't have any taste and reminds me of sawdust. Cucumber salad was light and refreshing. 

The service was fast and friendly, and the sushi chef cracks me up. I will give it another try again, just wasn't as impressed with the food quality as I have in the past."}
{"text":"Amazing service and presentable/delicious food. Definite recommendation for all sushi connoisseurs."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites! Very fresh and great customer service! They know what we want when we walk in now and have it ready before we go to order!"}
{"text":"Love Sumo Sushi - we go for the all you can eat option. I try different rolls and they are all good but my favorites are the spicy variety. The seaweed salad is delicious. At lunch time we had a party of 5, got served right away. Dinner time party of 4 and party of 2, both times we were served right away."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on yelp before, but I just have to share how I felt about the food in this establishment.  Absolutely salty except for non-sauced items like nigiri.  I had the all you can eat option and left me sending back bunch of items after taking my first bite even though I may be charged for unfinished food.  Waiter was nice enough to take back at no charge.  Pork belly I ordered was all fat.  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"So we came in last night really close to closing time to do a last second AYCE binge and felt pretty guilty because of how good this place was and we have been driving by it for years and never stopped by. We sat at the bar and were the only ones in the place the majority of the time. 
For us there's always a check list of things a sushi place has to have in order for us to come back or become regulars and it always seems to be impossible to get everything
Good Tuna Nigiri 
Good baked green mussels
Good customer service ( on bussing plates and refills) 
Being able to get half rolls
a couple of good rolls
And good unlimited desserts
And Sumo Sushi had all of this and more. The garlic tuna was the best I've had anywhere and so was the yuzu yellowtail. The other nigiri was all good as well (shrimp, peppered tuna, octopus, and squid) but the GT and YT really took the cake. 
For rolls we only got a joe special since we splurged on nigiri and appetizers which there is a good selection of both, which was pretty good but not super memorable the next day. 
For apps we got the Garlic edamame which was really good. The ahi poke was kind of spicy and separated the seaweed and tuna which I liked but really good. The creamy shrimp was a sort of shrimp crab Rangoon which I was a fan of. Baked green mussels here were pretty good as well not particularly different than anywhere but still pretty good. We also got the tuna sashimi which I can't remember what is was called but it was really good but comes as a one per person item. 
Now the dessert is where I will love a place and come back or not and the desserts here were really good because the only one per person item was the mochi which left us with Vanilla, green tea, strawberry cheesecake ice cream and tempura ice cream as well. All the ice cream was really good. The green tea was the sweet creamy tasting kind and the strawberry cheese cake was really good. We will definitely be back also from the great customer service we got from our sushi chef Ramir."}

Dancing Tiger Roll just didn't work. It might have been the eel sauce. Ignoring the eel sauce, the ingredients in the inside seem fine. The 69 roll was a really good roll overall. The gyoza was fine. Didn't get a chance to try Uni or Toro to really test this place.

Service: 
When we wanted to get Uni, the sushi chef recommended against because the quality wasn't that great. That gets them some points for being honest, but is this the norm?

Price:
Pre Restaurant.com GC, this place is more expensive about $2 or $3 more than Naked Fish across the menu. This seems minimal, when you order a lot of rolls it really ads up. However, once you use the $25 off of $50 on Dinner Only, things start to get more affordable. There is usually always an 80% Off code towards the end of the month.

Worth trying again with a Restaurant.com GC, otherwise I rather just go to Naked Fish."}
{"text":"All of their sushi is very good. Not too much rice on the nigiri which is great. Also their lunch menu has some very tasty options other than sushi."}
{"text":"That hot Cheeto roll is imprinted on me. It was so, so damn good. Definitely a MUST when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Usually a great experience but last week not so much. Service wasn't great and the food quality not up to the normal standard. Still a nice place but I expected better."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. Not the best sushi I've ever had bit also not the worst"}
{"text":"I typically like to go back to a restaurant before I give a bad review. Well, yesterday was my second time back with the same inexcusable service.

(Keep in mind this was consistent both visits)
Cons: Food was lukewarm
           Waitress always had to be called over,never once just checked on our table
            We went during happy hour- buy one sake or beer and get another free-\"they forgot to bring the free sake and beer\"-we had to remind them while they dropped off the check
             The music was not family friendly 
             The sushi was poorly made, fell apart before could put it in my mouth

Pros: No wait for seating
          Clean and neat
          Big selection on AYCE 

Overall, I will not be returning. Customer service is not acceptable and the food was not appetizing. I will be looking for another sushi place to call home."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times prior to this visit so the food is good . The problem this time was our server stopped coming around about 40 mins into our session . We're sitting near the sushi bar & kitchen & I see our sever walking back & forth w/o stopping by our table . We waited another 10 mins before flagging her down to ask her how much longer for the food we're waiting for . She tells us that it was delivered already , NO it wasn't ! Then tells us she'll look into it . Time goes on & still no food . As she walks by I ask her again, where's our food ?!? She has no answer . So we reorder .... just for her to tell us 15 mins later that it was delivered . If you're going to have an All You Can Eat sushi restaurant keep it that way . I get it with the 90 min time limit but 40 mins into it & our server stops taking our order . We'll NEVER go back , too many other choices in Vegas . 2 stars for this last experience !"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this awesome Sushi place not far from our home. Good food and fast service"}
{"text":"I actually come here every other visit I make to Vegas and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet! Well for starters, I love the fact that whenever I try to come here, they're never ridiculously busy. I always get a seat right away. 

Their rolls are delicious and their appetizer menu is extensive. They have sashimi salads that are GREAT and I tried this no rice roll called stuffed tomato (which is crab rolled with salmon) and oh myyyyyy. I still day dream about it! 

I think this restaurant is underhyped since it's tucked away from tourists.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"The AYCE lunch price is around $20. Lots to choose from. Hubby's favorite was the Touch Down. Was suggested by my brother and I'll have to thank him when I see him next."}
{"text":"We ate here often before they changed management, and while they were excellent before... I have to admit the new Sumo Sushi II manages to surprise and satisfy me even more.

The new dishes they have are out of this world. I'm not quite a sushi pro, but I've had at least 10 places in Vegas alone. What they create here don't taste like tasty carbon copies; each roll had a distinct flavor, some even surprising twists on old favorites (the delicious black pepper kick to their volcano roll for instance). As others have said, you must try the karai. In fact, everything that has one serving for AYCE is worth the order. We even had a special salmon roll, freshly torched in front of us. The gimmick was fun, but the taste incredible. On top of the taste, the staff was very attentive and in good spirits.

I've had sushi as good, but for $25 AYCE dinner, the quality to price ratio makes this a steal. Definitely give them a shot!"}
{"text":"this place is great!  sat at the bar and the Sushi Chefs were great, friendly, helpful and looking out for me.  The waiter service looked good for those at tables/booths.  

the sushi was great, fresh, and delicious.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Where the hell do I begin?? NASTY!!!! What a waste of $70!! 3 dishes they brought out was going bad!! It tasted spoiled! I think it was the Hawaiian roll, the ikura roll (fish eggs), and the Uni ( tasted like turpentine :-/ ) stay away from this place!! Don't waste your money on waste here. All the waiters could say was SORRY about the nasty food, we got no refund! I'm definitely going to complain to the health department that they are serving spoiled food. JUST HORRIBLE!!!.... And they need to clean their damn floors, my shoes were sticking on them!"}
{"text":"Went there for pre Valentines dinner. 
My new favorite sushi bar on my side of town.
Eric is the best sushi chef in Las Vegas. And all the servers are super nice. Of couse sushi is so fresh and food from kitchen are top notch. Best of all, soon they will open until 4AM. I'm so glad good business is growing."}
{"text":"I ordered to go. And it was great. Fast, well done and delicious.
Will most definitely order from them tonight for dinner"}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch special- $12 for miso soup, salad, and 2 sushi rolls- more than enough for me! We've gone here many times and always enjoyed our meal. They aren't very consistent in the food (cucumber salad is different every time we go), but it is always delicious."}
{"text":"Really great quality sushi. I've had almost all of the specialty rolls and have never been disappointed. I've also tried the Tuna Tataki salad which is probably enough for two people.

The only thing I would suggest is to get there before 8pm. Since the sushi chefs usually end up drinking with the guests, countless sake bombs later and as the nigh wears on, you start to wait a little bit longer for your order to go through."}
{"text":"Great place! I like the staff a lot the chefs are very friendly and easy to talk to and the prices are pretty good. Their rolls are really good the appetizers are bomb."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location near the 215, tucked away in my neighborhood. The service is usually very attentive. The atmosphere is lively, with plenty of buzz and TV screens showing sports and sometimes J-Pop hits. The food is excellent (personal favorite is the spicy crab roll); don't hesitate to try some of the less traditional baked rolls as well!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Always fresh and always great service.  A lot of sushi places you get ignored or slow service, but not here.  If anything, they might check on you TOO much, if that's even possible.  Super friendly, lots of choices and every kind of roll, great AYCE.  Seriously can't go wrong with this place, it's always great."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good 5 years ago...now new chefs and managers are not so friendly and the food is mediocre....so disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've dined here a few times and the service is always A1. They are super quick and very friendly. A friend of mine introduced me to this place which I had no idea was located in my area. When I come I always order the all you can eat which is an amazing deal. It's 23 for lunch and 26 for dinner and well worth it. Make sure you come on an empty stomach because there are so many options. My favorites are the Japanese lasagna, scream honey roll, the orgasm roll and the Vegas roll is a hit too! The baked muscles are amazing as well, I love the tuna salad those are the best appetizers. They offer a few different sake options and beer, I wish they had a full bar for those of us who enjoy cocktails that's the only con. I love there deserts the tempura ice cream with strawberry sauce drizzled on top is addicting. They have Mochi as well. They stay open pretty late for not being located in China town, they close at midnight which is nice I'll continue to dine here with my friends."}
{"text":"Great selection of rolls, good daily/happy hour specials.  Very quick service, nice atmosphere and good staff.  My only complaint is the music is a little loud."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. DONT DO IT!!! The quality of everything was very low grade. We couldn't finish anything because of how bad tasting it is. Me and my husband are huge foodies and we were very disappointed. Guess we'll just stick to Nobu!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats and was very impressed. They packaged everything neatly with al the sauces on the side. Even the ones I asked for extra. Would definitely check this place out again."}
{"text":"We love coming here for AYCE sushi and happy hour! Tiffany always treats us like family and the sushi chefs (especially Beto) are always so kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Eh- what can I say-
Friendly staff, which is good, but quality is very........\"low\"......... not bad, but just not really all that great,
Good variety of items, pretty good size portions though with AYCE I would expect smaller portions to allow for more order variety."}
{"text":"Sushi anywhere you go is pretty pricy but it if it's good food it's worth it! I've had sumo multiples time and it's been take out. We always order their baked rolls especially their \"Who's your daddy,\" it is so good! The sauces they also serve with these rolls is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was great! But, and this is a big but for me. My group and I would order something and wait like 30 minutes and never get it. Order it a second time and wait for 30 minutes and never get it. So we just gave up. I could understand if the place was packed. But when there was 3 people in there (our group only) and never get your food. Something is wrong."}
{"text":"I'll start with the cons: the front doesnt look appealing, seemed a bit \"cheap\" but that's because I'm from a competitive and aggressive sushi area. During service, a few missed orders but it's AYCE so it's forgiven. I do wish there was a hostess so I wasn't walking in, awkwardly asking questions and for a seat. With that being said, I wouldn't say it should stray you away from trying this place. 

Here's the pros: great food, great options for an AYCE. For a casual eater, there's probably a lot of items you've never tried that they offer and that is a good thing. I, myself, am quite experienced and enjoy a variety of things and this place was able to offer that for a $25 ish AYCE (dinner). It is Korean owned so I enjoy the quality/variety of items offered.

The chef (he calls himself the rookie), Siko (pronounced See-ko), was nothing short of awesome. I ordered Saba, Hamachi, and Ika to start. The female server came and suggested the Tuna Poke and I also ordered an agedashi tofu along with it. I was content. The rice was tasty but a bit wet (nigiri fell apart a few times). But that's okay because most place don't offer flavorful sushi rice. I was most impress by the fish, it had a soft and fresh texture which I enjoyed immensely. The tuna poke was flavorful and the agedashi tofu was alright. I followed up by ordering uni, amaebi, sake, and hirame nigiri with an order of pork belly and fresh oyster. The sushi chef did forget my hirame but it did not faze me as I was content with the offerings served. The pork belly was flavorful and served on a sizzling plate (tasted like Korean marinaded pork belly). The fresh oyster was delightful and composed with massago, chopped scallions, spicy sauce (sriricha?), sweet sesame oil soy with a touch of yuzu (I assume). The uni was creamy. I did not care for the sweet shrimp and they don't fry the head unfortunately (bummer!).
I then ended it with a spicy tuna handroll, hamachi roll, and seaweed salad. The owner then served up another order of oyster. I ate everything with a few bites of rice leftover. Keep in mind, this is how they get you in AYCE, they fill you up with rice so stray away from rolls if you want your money's worth.
At the end I was full. I had a nice conversation with the sushi chef. The owner talked to me for a little and the server was sweet offering me ice cream.
I tipped the house 22% and another $5 to the sushi bar because I was satisfied. 

All in all, don't judge it by the front. It's a decent hole in the wall. I will visit again very soon.

A few things to help: all Front-of-house should introduce themselves and be more attentive. Apologize for missing orders even though it's usually not a big deal. But very minimal things to the whole experience, I enjoyed it very much. Thank you! 

You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot. The fish is always up to quality, very friendly staff and owner and very creative with their rolls"}
{"text":"This place can be summed up in one word - awful. In a search to find a good sushi spot in Las Vegas, I came upon Sumo.  Walking in, I took a look at the menu and decided to give it a shot. Looking at the AYCE menu, I decided to go with a la carte. Thank god I did.

Ordering a few simple rolls, they came out promptly but were warm and soggy - the opposite of fresh. All rolls were chewy (should have ordered soy paper for the extra charge) and the Philly roll had enough cream cheese to choke a horse. Add to this the fact that the waters came out in dirty glasses with no ice and that gives a full snapshot of the meal. 

Once I stomach down a few pieces, I looked down to find my napkin and unfortunately saw the sides of the \"white\" table cloth. These resembled a scene out of CSI.

Immediately asking for the check, we walked out with no intent on returning and very thankful we steered clear of the AYCE option. The only reason this review has 2 stars is because the staff is very friendly, constantly smiling and always prompt when refilling our tap water."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here and I guess they're under new management now. Completely different experience then what I've had in the past. Rolls just weren't good. Kept getting strange hints of different things in the rolls. Their screaming o sauce tastes like straight onion! Just not good, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food for good prices. Every once in a while we go in and their customer service is not great, but they have stepped up their game recently. The Dancing Tiger and their Screaming O Salad are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon probably around 12:45ish. We were greeted immediately and seated. We were the only couple in there for about 15 minutes which is weird because it's Saturday. We did the ayce which is 20.00 from hours 11am-pm. So for two people the total was about 43.00 bucks, but it sure is worth every penny. Everything was made perfect. The chefs we exceptionally nice. The food was amazing. We ordered the sunset roll, salmon roll, fried rice, house salad, egg rolls , coconut shrimp, hungry roll, and the mochi strawberry dessert!!!
The best sushi in southwest Vegas. I will definitely be coming back to the ayce!!!!"}
{"text":"I my first visit back here since new management took over... was nervous,  lol... but ended up pleasantly surprised.  I ordered take out but the staff that helped me was very friendly and helpful.  And all the food I ordered was excellent.  Some things are better, some seem the same and other are worse... but that's to be expected I think.  The menu appeared to be the same... but now it's got pictures of the rolls which I thought was helpful!   The tuna kurai... was different... more like a salad... but still had a ton of tuna and they topped it with crunchy wonton pieces.  I actually liked it better, which is saying something because it was always a favorite.  The spicy garlic edamame however seemed worse... still coated in sauce but no where near as tasty.  Everything else I ordered seemed about the same... which was good. I guess if quality is going to drop somewhere.... The edamame is not too bad in my book."}
{"text":"Terrible!  I had a roll with shrimp tempura in it and the shrimp tempura tasted like it was made a day or 2 ago and was stale and hard (just like when you leave a bag of potato chips open for a few days) it was NOT fresh at all.  The few other items I ordered were eh, 1 of the sauces with the burrito rolls was like ranch dressing.  The uni was not fresh and was starting to go bad. For those of you who enjoy uni, it's a noticeable difference between fresh and bad. They don't do half rolls and their service was fine.  I was there at approx 6 p.m. on a Thursday and there was hardly anyone in there for the hour I was there. (maybe 3 other tables). They are in a very good location and should be busy but they're not because their food is bad and people know it (look at other reviews)  Goyemon, Sushi-Mon, Hikari, are ALWAYS busy, good service and fast with getting orders out.  ALL 3 of these places are better than this place and the owner should learn from them."}
{"text":"Well, to start off, I live right next to them and I thought about trying this place out. Me and my boyfriend had all you can eat. Everything was amazing. My boyfriend ordered a roll with mushrooms, which I am allergic too so I told the waitress I couldn't eat it. She told me I'm still gonna get charged for the roll on top of all you can eat prices. And she said \"you can just pick the mushrooms out.\" I was really upset about this and asked her about getting a different roll and she said \"it doesn't matter if you get a different role. You have to pay for this one if you don't eat it.\" Overall I gave them a few stars because it wasn't a bad place. Just poor service."}
{"text":"Sitting down in the restaurant we had very high hopes - great atmosphere, and our 2 year old loved the fish tank, which is amazing and kept her entertained. We were impressed about the kid friendly touches, like the Barbi plate they brought out for her, and the cute bear-faced bento box her food was served in. But then the food came, and it all went downhill.  The chicken in the bento box was about as rubbery as I've ever seen, and she wouldn't touch it.  The fries were fresh, hot, and bland as the day is long.  The pork tonkatsu was fried through to the point of being cardboardy.  For my wife and I, the only way we could describe the sushi was that it tasted \"handled\".  The rice was fine, but the fish, and I mean no roll was spared, seemed to be strangely soft and closer to room temperature than I'm used to.  It really seemed like someone had rolled it around in their hands for an awkwardly long period of time before plating.  Can't say whether it was the quality of the fish or technique, but we won't be going back to investigate further, which is a shame, since the setting and service would have made this place a staple if the food was even just passable."}
{"text":"horrible, horrible service!"}
{"text":"Probably my all time favorite sushi spot in Vegas! The ayce options and price are the best in town. Service is always great too! Tiffany is always such a doll and remembers me when I go in. The staff is super sweet and makes you feel so welcome! They're extremely helpful too if you have any questions. 

Definitely recommend!! Must get the baked green mussels, pepper seared tuna, and the flaming hot Cheeto roll. 
Take your friends from out of town here & they will end up jealous of your sushi spot!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times already and by far this is the best sushi spot I've been to.  The sushi chefs are awesome and so super friendly.  They are so friendly, that when I took my cousin's here one time for dinner they were all over them.  LOL.  They just loved how cute my cousins are.  :)  The best sushi guy I've had, Tak, works there too.  He knows his ingredients, and knows how to entertain the taste buds.  I come here as much as I can.  I'll even walk there even if i have to.  Yeah, I'm a fan of their menu.

From the outside, it doesn't seem like it's a great place to eat at.  But, once you step in it's like being in a whole different world.  The feng shui is perfect.  To the right are the hostesses ready to greet me and seat me down.  There's really no wait since I go at the right time.  I mostly go to the bar since I like talking to the chefs.  They're just awesome.  Tak is the best too.  He talks only as much as he needs to and is very polite.  To the left by the entrance a few feet away from the bar, a huge fish tank lies there with a lot of tropical fish.  I could see Nemo swimming around.

As soon as I'm seated, Tak has a cucumber salad garnished with crab meat on top ready for me to eat.  The first item I order is, of course, the oysters.  The oysters in here are huge and plump.  Very tasteful.  It's prepared with salmon roe on top, green onions, and some soy sauce mixture with something in it.  It's so tasty.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back for it.

For my next item, I chose a crunchy roll #2.  This a sushi roll with shrimp, calamari, crab, cucumbers, and I think avocado in eel sauce.  Over the rice, there's tempura crumbs coating it.  The best part of the whole Sumo Sushi 2 experience is Tak's Special.  It's a lightly seared tuna in some kind of soy sauce mixture dressed in fried sweet onions.  It's so simple but when combined in my mouth, it's like fireworks.  The blend of the tuna with the crunchy onions compliment each other.

If you like Poki, this is the place to eat it.  The way it's made is different from all the other sushi spots I've eaten at.  It's a little spicy and has a good kick in it.  The other great sushis are the Lasagna, Joe, and so many others that I can't think of it.  I've had majority of their sushis but they're named differently and the ingredients are like none I've had before.  

The dessert to go for is the Fried Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream.  I couldn't finish it myself and would require at least two people to devour it.  Mochi is good too, but anyone can get that from the store.  I love the fact it's not too expensive.  But for those that love to eat a lot, maybe it might be a little pricey.  

Mmmm... Sumo Sushi 2."}
{"text":"So we tried eating here again..when we pulled up it said under new management do we decided to forgive the past and try it.ill tell you guys this the food was average but the service was phenomenal! Everything came out pretty fast and my drink was always filled up."}
{"text":"My first time at this location.  Very much satisfied with the service and food.  We got the Johnny Boy, 911, Uni and the Screaming O.  We will most definitely be coming  back.  I've had the Live Uni at the old location and have to try that again.  Not to mention the BOGO tall Kirin Light!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but service sucks. Gave this place a couple times to make up for lack of service, we waiting for 10 minutes for a menu after asking for one. Takes forever for someone to take your order. Luckily the sushi chef asked us what we wanted."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going here. First time coming here tonight and they said that dessert were included to the all you can eat so we went. But while waiting for our order my wife notice that there's a limit on mochi 1 per person. How can you say a place with all you can eat food and limit you for eating the food?? Don't make sense right so the manager came out and told us that she will give us 2 per person so I told her to cancel the order and we're going to goyemon who serve all you can eat for real. No limit on what you eat. So if your looking for sushi place that really served all you can eat go to goyemon or Kobe sushi. Good luck to the new owner / management on this place. We're not going back here and I will spread the word to all my friends and family not to come here."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times and each time is incredible. The food is the best Asian I've had. We took my boyfriend's brother here and he's a sushi king, and even he agreed that this is the best sushi he's had. The all you can eat is so good!!! The sushi is soft and the rice is perfectly sticky. The quality of the fish is top notch. The rest of the all you can eat is fantastic too. It includes appetizers and soups and all. Everything is perfectly made. And I'm super picky, lol. Thanks Sumo Sushi :)"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious for \"all you can eat\". Plus, drink specials from 5-11p. This is neighborhood gem!!  Just don't take my spot!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi if they would stop piling a bunch of crap on it that takes away from the integrity of the food. Nice environment."}
{"text":"When we got to the parking lot it was empty. I was thinking it might not be great but I was wrong. The fish was fresh, our server hyunju was funny and prompt. And we always do ayce and I definitely recommend this place. Btw, the music is very eclectic from 80's to top hits. Pics to follow. Everything we ordered was awesomely great!"}
{"text":"They are under new ownership and in my opinion have only gotten better! The customer service is out of this world. The Ayce sushi is great. I love the different rolls you can choose from. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on date night."}
{"text":"Sumo Sushi 2 is so fantastic! The service here is splendid. Drinks come in quick and so does the food. The sushi chefs here are also amazing! They're funny, make sushi quick, and best of all, delicious! I highly recommend this place for those who loves sushi. The appetizers here are mouth watering. The pork belly and the bacon/scallop skewers are outstanding."}
{"text":"This is a good place overall, but nothing spectacular.

Let me describe my experiences at this place...

Food: The food is definitely not bad. It's not the best sushi place I've been to, but it's deifnitely better than most shopping center-located sushi places. The taste was good and fish fresh. I loved their unique combinations and dish names such as \"Orgasm\" etc. It was modern and fun. The rolls were extremely average, albeit fresh. Not too much taste, yet freshness was definitely top notch. 

Service: Waitresses were not very knowledgeable about their dishes or specials. I found two of the three servers to be sub-par in their cuisine knowledge, price knowledge and friendly attitude. They were passable, but definitely not great on the three occasions that I dined here. Sushi chef was okay, but not nearly as friendly as at other places. The wait staff overall seemed annoyed that I visited for lunch, although I did drop over $100 on the bill...which brings me to the next topic...

Price: Overpriced. By far. Check out my other sushi places reviews--this by far was one of the most expensive. For lunch, no all you can eat sushi was offered and individual pricing was definitely on the high side, considering that this place is located in a shopping center and that food was good, but not spectacular by any means

Ambience and Atmosphere--excellent. In this aspect this is definitely one of the best places--everything from black granite counter tops, to cloth napkins to a humongous fish tank circling the dining room--this place screems style and modern fashion. I loved that it is located in a strip mall, but feels like you are dining on the strip. I did not notice any rap music, in fact music was a subdued elevator type of music, which suited my eating style just fine.

Overall, this is not a bad place. But, there are definitely better in a neighborhood. If you have coupons to use for this place or don't care how much money you spend, then this is definitely an excellent choice, but if money is at least a small issue, than there are better options near by. Although, I may visit this place again in the near future. Not all bad, but not terribly exciting is my verdict for Sumo 2"}
{"text":"I come here frequently for the all you can eat (we live down the street).  My wife and I are vegetarians and there seems to be plenty for us.  I like the vegetable burrito (it is like a giant tempura roll), potato croquettes, agadeshi tofu (sp?), miso ramen, and tempura vegetables.  There are some vegetable rolls I also dig."}
{"text":"Great sushi with great service. Stay away from everything on that separate desert menu. I found it funny that they have a giant fish aquarium filled with fish completely unaware of what is going on outside the glass lol...made my sashimi that much better!"}
{"text":"Don''t Waste your $$!!!! My friend and I had went there 5/12/17 the waitress was mad rushing me to get my Order as If it was busy. While I'm trying to tend to my autistic son. Than it took forever to get our order than when food finally arrives the rice was super soggy and fell apart.
I had complained it to servers than they told sushi chef to put our sauces on side on our next sushi roll but of course still soggy. I'm horrible  w/ chopsticks. So used my hands and still disintegrated before I can bring it to my mouth. Sushi wasn''t good.  It use to be good now it's horrible. I won't ever come  back Again."}
{"text":"I came in at 9 and was the only person besides another couple who was sitting previous.. I must have waited forever for my sushi to come. Matter of fact I am writing this review while waiting for my food. I will NEVER NEVER come here again. The worst service ever. When first walking in I was asked to move closer and I refused due to me wanting to sit away from the other couple to have some privacy. I swear worst place ever."}
{"text":"I love sushi. So I've had my fair share of good and bad. First, all their cucumber dishes had to be expired. Cucumber was bitter as it could get. Then the fish was definitely not as fresh as it could be.  They pack everything with as much rice as possible. Their pork belly is a joke. To top it off, the servers had friends eating there and it was more important to serve them over their customers.  I don't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Bought a restaurant.com voucher and it does not say that you can't use it on take out. I read in some reviews this place is not kid friendly and being that I have 2 young children I wouldn't want to give my business to a place that isn't family friendly.  Going to get a refund and spend my money elsewhere. Too bad for them....my kids love sushi. $$$"}
{"text":"Very nice and affordable and the place was super clean and the waiter was so sweet and nice  food was amazing love the secret menu the have chetto roll super spicy but boom..."}
{"text":"Only can attest for the AYCE lunch deals. Great selection and service, and would say it's definitely worth it. Would recommend giving this a try to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ever since new management it has tanked sorry just not the same :( quality isn't that good anymore  . Everybody is too serious . Isn't a fun experience anymore ."}
{"text":"Pink lady and volcano rolls are the best!  I have been going here for 2 years and I think they have the most friendly/funny sushi chefs in town.  If you're looking for a good, chill place to have sushi I would suggest this one!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places so far. The food is amazing here depending what you get. The fish is one of the freshest that I have had living here in Vegas. The quality of the fish doesn't change with choosing the AYCE option, which makes the price definitely worth it.The staff welcomes you right when you walk into the door, and the chefs interact with you when you sit at the bar. Their sushi chef's are SO friendly! They are definitely a reason why we return to this sushi spot. The atmosphere is relaxing, with little enclaves for parties if you enjoy your own privacy. The fish tank is beautiful there, and really adds to the overall feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Whoooooooo they're great 
Customer services is # 1 
We came on Mother's Day 
Thank you so much for good sushi and more 
Will recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Very tasty, incredibly friendly, great value for the prices, open until 4 and right next my house. I seriously could not be any happier. I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"Only give it a 3 due to not having half orders for sushi bar ayce customers.  When your new to the place and you want to try rolls, full orders are to much. Would have went back again if they did held orders atleast at the sushi bar. Fish was good"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this Sushi joint, and told me I would be blown away, as the Sushi chef - Beto (sp?) is amazing! I would have never thought that such an amazing sushi joint would be in a strip mall. I went 2 nights in a row and can't wait to go back! Probably one of the best Sushi joints I've been to in the US. Beto's dishes were fantastic - I can't say enough good stuff. The staff is very outgoing / friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place in town!  Their sushi is fresh and tasty.  The staff is fun and they make you feel at home.  Good times on the weekends with all those that come to this place.  

I have been to most places in Las Vegas and no one can match their dishes.  

If you are out of town, take the cab ride out to this place and get some great sushi. 

Great service, fun people, and even better sushi!!!!  

Don't miss this great place!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this a 3 star was because one of the sushi chef was nice and got my order serve quickly.  Additionally, the sushi were good but the server was terrible. The last time my nephew and I were here the service was already bad but I told myself I'll give it one more try but I guess my visit yesterday will definitely be the last. Will definitely not be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've been here so I guess it's about time I posted a review. The AYCE here is reasonable and very good. The consistency changes each time I'm here though. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it means more sashimi or bigger rolls, other times it might mean a roll is made just slightly different than the last time you were here.  This happened to me with the Valley Roll. Both times it was excellent but the second time i ordered it they seemed to add a sauce that wasnt there before .Again, this isn't a bad thing. The quality of the food is still very good and the service is always excellent. I really like that they include appetizers in the AYCE menu too. It's a nice twist that most other places don't do."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious sushi!! Price isn't bad either about $10 (some are $8, some are $12) for large 8 piece cut roll. Service was great. There's also an awesome projector system that was playing really cool JPop songs. This is going to be my new go to sushi spot. Get the Yum Yum Crab roll if you like baked rolls, you'll know why they call it Yum Yum. The Sunrise Roll was great for fresh rolls...just the perfect amount of spicy!!"}
{"text":"Great service, always fresh food, and the price is worth the value! A few times a month is not enough... wish they stayed open later though."}
{"text":"Being the sushi elitist I am, this place was actually really good.  My sister and I got takeout the other night and it was prepared quickly and was fresh.  The menu was huge and they had a large offering of special maki rolls, along with a good selection of sashimi and nigiri.  There is a huge tropical fish tank in the lobby that is L shaped and has a really cool fish in it, however I think due to how new the place is there really aren't all that many fish in there yet.  If you're in the area, give it a try.  Next time I'd definitely eat in, or eat outside on their patio."}
{"text":"We'll start with 10 orders of salmon sushi please. 

This has been our go to spot for AYCE sushi for a couple years and I have no complaints. Other than the fact that I end up eating way more sushi than I would have ever needed to. 

Coming is here is usually an event for my boyfriend and I and a family of 4 we come with. I enjoy coming with a larger party so we can have more variety, more options and taste more rolls. 

The service has always been fast and attentive. Even though they are probably shocked at the amount of food we order. The fish always seems fresh and the rolls prepared and constructed beautifully. I think the price is fair too, considering the AYCE is not only sushi but appetizers and salads too. 

The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit and we usually sit In a big table tucked into the corner as if we have our own little room (perfect for kids)."}
{"text":"This spot is under new management, as everyone else is stating. The spot in my opinion is hit and miss, it seems as though they have their good days and their bad days, regardless that is unacceptable with any restaurant. 

With sushi, there is no off day, have an off day and people notice very quickly. I remember their rolls tasting better, AYCE is probably the best deal. I'm really only there for the Nigiri. 

I've had good experience and bad staff wise, something that needs to be address, don't enjoy your job don't come to work, or bring drama with you. I've been a server, and am currently a Bartender, I leave my shit at home, I'm here to make money, not mope around."}
{"text":"If I could write a death bed menu it would no doubt have the baked Las Vegas roll with crab & lobster. Service is fun & fast. We love Maria the server and ask for her every time."}
{"text":"We went here on Valentine's day! Maybe one of the worst Sushi experiences weve ever had. Service was extremely slow. Food came out without flavor and without proper ingredients as stated on the menu. The waiter even stated that they haven't been busy so the kitchen is \"cutting corners\". Fish was good, but sloppy service and forgeting our orders made it such a terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome!! The sushi was delicious and the chef/s were so energetic and friendly! And funny! Will go again :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. Worst service ever!! My husband was full and done eating by the time I received my first roll, mind you his rolls took at least 20 min.  Our appetizers were never brought our drinks were empty. The chef did ask how things were and I informed him of the lack of service he also made a delicious plate as an apology. He grabbed our server who then came over not to apologize but to ask \"anything else\". Uhhh yeah some food. She was very quick to bring us our check. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this place as it was truly horrible service."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! My husband and I go at least once a month for the AYCE. They make everything fresh right there. The sushi chefs r all sooooo nice and really make u feel special."}
{"text":"Love this place and their sushi. All you can eat, I didnt have any of their creative sushi, just stuck with the basic rolls, super white tuna, fresh water eel, uni, snow crab, salmon, yellowtail and more. All the rolls were fresh and tasted great. Sushi chiefs were funny and fast on service. Make sure you seat at the sushi bar to get the whole experience. The place is spacious and beautiful. Another all you can eat sushi spot to try."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and welcoming.  My complaint in which we won't be returning is the fish to rice ratio for the nigiri.  Small sliver of fish and a big chunk of rice.  Stars goes to the wait staff."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my FAVORITE sushi spot! The sushi is always fresh and the selection is amazing. From the sushi, to appetizers, to delicious desserts, Sumo 2 has it all figured out. Some of my favorite sushi rolls are the Tuna Naruto (instead of nori, the roll is wrapped in cucumber) & Salmon Killer. I also love the garlic ahi nigiri & you have to try their Screaming O Salad. Appetizers are on point and my favorite is the bacon scallop skewers and the bulgogi. Majority of the time, sushi comes out quickly and the staff is very helpful. I will be back over and over again! Thanks Sumo Sushi 2!"}
{"text":"I Just love this place. Those who live close to this place know how I feel. This place is on par with my other favorite all you can sushi spots. You really can't beat $25. I usually eat close to $160 worth of sushi every time I go. Besides being good, they are also fast. 

I am also big on spots that are not crowded. I have been here like 10 times and never have I waited to be seated. 

Favorites -
Salmon nigiri
Lobster Crunch roll
Lasagna roll"}
{"text":"This was one of my best sushi experiences. The staff was extremely friendly and funny!!! Te was awesome. He recommended \"Something Wrong\" and it was delicious. The atmosphere even at 5pm was amazing.

I will definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"The staff at Sumo Sushi 2 are indeed pretty awesome.  They are friendly, attentive, and efficient.

I read some Yelp reviews earlier in the day, and decided I was feeling in the mood for sushi and trying a new place, so when my GPS listed Sumo Sushi as one of the nearby sushi restaurant I knew right away that that was where I was going to go for dinner.

The ambiance was great. Right when you walk in, you can see large aquariums (salt water) with colorful fish swimming about.  The lighting is on the dimmer side, which sets a good atmosphere for those on a romantic dinner.

I tried their AYCE menu (~$26 +tax).  And overall I thought the fish served were fresh, including their special sashimi (3 options available on the AYCE menu).

Special Sashimi:
Tuna Karai - basically cubes of tuna with a blend of spicy seasoning.  They can make this really spicy if you request it, but it was pretty spicy without any special request.  So unless you can handle the heat, don't try to impress anyone asking for 9/10, then not being able to finish it :p  It was good, if you like tuna.

Cocaine - this one was good too, slightly different flavors, but not all that different.

Screaming Orgasm - slices of fish dressed in their \"Orgasm\" sauce.  Not bad.

I mostly had their nigiri and some items from the appetizer section.  The nigiri were good, except they didn't have uni when I went, so that was rather disappointing.  Of the items on the appetizer section, my favorite is the Kurobuta Sausage, which was basically 1 pork sausage sliced up and served with ketchup. In hindsight, I should have ordered like 2 or 3 of these (since I don't think it is on the menu at other AYCE sushi restaurants).

Of the rolls, I was only able to ordered two:

Tuna Naruto - refreshing roll of various fish (salmon, tuna, krab) wrapped in cucumber.  (No rice).  The chef who prepared it has good knife skill, so it turned out looking as tasty as it was beautiful.  

Something Wrong #69 - not a bad roll, but drenched in way too much spicy garlic ponzu sauce or was it regular soy sauce (?), because it was so salty that I drank 2 cups of hot tea trying to finish it all.

After that I was done. Too much rice + hot tea = bloated stomach.

Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Price: 4/5 reasonable for AYCE.
Location: Off the Durango exit on 215, so great for locals, but not for out of town visitors.

4/5 in my book.  And just FYI, the sushi has Korean influence in terms of the way they flavor their special sauces, rolls and such."}
{"text":"I told the chef to make me what he thought was a good roll and told him what kind of fish I liked. He made me a Candy Cane roll with soft shell crab inside, yellow tale & tuna on top, topped with a garlic ponzu sauce.... OMG it was sooo good. I think the roll was about $13-14, which is a bit expensive, but it was so good, I'd order it again!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi place! I love the rolls and yummy appetizers! Lunch is only $20 for AYCE and dinner is only $25! Definitely worth the price and the quality is very good and comparably better to other sushi places that I've been to did not have AYCE."}
{"text":"I have gone to this sushi joint numerous times. Great customer service, delicious and fresh food, and timing is great! I have Dinden and have done many takeout orders and I have never been let down! Yum Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Third time here. Each time I bring new family or friends and they all agree that this is the best sushi they've ever had. 

Jjanga Chang, the sushi chef, is amazing and very friendly. If he has time, he'll come to your table, if you ask. 

Ordeed the \"Cocaine\" bowl to start...... Fantastic! Had the \"fat ass\", the \"who's your daddy?\" And the \"mistake roll\". We kept going. 

Before coming here, ordering nigiri and sashimi was daunting for me, but everything is so good that I even ordered the octopus nigiri. 

BEST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Anytime I see a \"under new management\" sign I always think \"this place is in trouble\"........

We live down the street from this place and have meaning to go for awhile.....So glad we did! They have this lobster crunch roll on their menu that's probably the best roll I have ever tried! AYCE I think was only 25$ and all of their \"dinner entrees\" come with miso soup, salad, rice, and veggies. I had he miso salmon (15$) simple, good and so cheap for everything you get with it. Can't wait to go back! Get the lobster crunch roll!!!"}
{"text":"No lie...this place deserves every star. The sushi is just great and staff makes you feel like family!"}
