{"text":"Passable but don't go here if you're looking for authentic Portuguese chicken. Visited here recently to get some take-out for a family dinner. The front desk service was awful. We ordered a whole chicken, with hot sauce on the side and the usual sides of parisienne potatoes and dirty rice. I also ordered the fish filet dinner.  Okay, so I was raised Portuguese (see my other reviews) and I can tell you that this place does not serve the real deal. The chicken itself was okay. The potatoes were okay (no brainer). The rice was soggy and tasteless. Traditionally, the Portuguese dirty rice has black olives in it and often, baby clams. Nothing here. The hot sauce was atrocious. I'm not sure how they make it but we were all perplexed as to its strange aroma and taste. Definitely not peri-peri sauce! The fish filet was okay but alas, it was breaded in a herbed bread crumb mixture. Traditionally, us Portuguese don't put herbs in our breading. I will say that the gal putting the food together was a hoot and on the ball.  It makes me wonder: is this place actually run by a Portuguese individual? On any note, the food is passable but definitely not authentic."}
{"text":"Went in there place was empty, got two quarter chicken with rice and potatoes. Nastiest food I have ever had in my life. Was cooked within five minutes. Chicken was warm in some spots and cold in others, rice was disgusting and potatoes were soggy as hell. Would never come back."}
{"text":"Good chicken, yummy sides, great bread, and good portions. The place is small and can get a little confusing between who's waiting for take out and who's waiting for a table when you step into the place. Piri piri sauces are nice and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"It was a cute restaurant, with cute decor. Service was not clear that we were to order at the counter and then sit down, so found it unorganized. We ordered fish and chips and the Rotisserie Chicken but we didn't really taste anything special. The food is good but nothing great. Probably would not go again."}
{"text":"It's really good! The real thing and the way  they grill the vegetables so authentic right on the fire chicken is delicious too!! Piri piri sauce to choose from"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are bomb and full of fresh ingredients! I have also tried their classic chicken entree with rice and potatoes which was good but not fantastic. The sides could be more flavourful.  Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this little diamond right beside willison chrysler on eglington avenue east (vic park). The first thing that hits you is how inviting the space is, clean, modern but without all the pretention! Service is attentive, friendly and conciderate it is quite clear that customers come first here. Now to the best part, the food. If location, location, location are the hallmarks of real estate success then quality is the cornerstone of good foodservice operations. From the fresh daily portuguese buns to the homemade sauces and fresh cut fries it was all good. All in I paid $16 for the combo with an authentic custard tart. Seemed pretty cheap concidering the quality and fair portion.  In these times of mass chains and corporate food it really is important to stand behind the family run businesses, especially when they put out a good product like this!"}
{"text":"Their portions are big which is nice. I ordered a salad with peri peri chicken.   However I did not enjoy my chicken. It was extremely bland and borderline unappetizing. Their salad was average.   I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Drove by many times before and finally got a chance to try this place. Enjoyed the hot chourico with cheddar cheese on a bun but was surprised by the total... 12 dollars! Decor was nice and service was friendly but I would think twice before going again unless it was payday."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the family for lunch and I left happy with their amazing custard tarts.    The place had costumers constantly coming in, mostly for take-out and what seemed like frequent costumers so that says a lot about the place.  You can also dine in which is nice. Nothing fancy, really.  Your food is served in the same take-out packages since you may save some food to take home.    The waitress we had was kind and courteous.  Was a little behind with providing cutlery in the beginning as well as the drinks.  Also didn't offer to refill any drinks including water.  Otherwise, she was still very nice.  I'm a little easier when it comes to this type of service but for those really looking for hands on service, you'll probably find more things to complain about.    [Mains] Rotisserie Chicken - when we got these, they were cut into pieces but it seemed like there was more white meat than dark meat.  I personally prefer dark meat but the white meat I did have wasn't as dry as it usually is at places.  It was actually still quite juicy.  Also tasted great with their hot sauce.  4/5  Parisian Potatoes - This actually came with the rotisserie chicken since we ordered a Family Meal.  They were nicely seasoned and cooked but still had a little lack of flavour.   Would've tasted great with some kind of dip but then the sauce from the rotisserie chicken went nicely with it.  4/5  Rice - Was just plain rice cooked in what looked like tomato sauce.  I could be wrong, though.  Overall, it went nicely with the chicken.  If you like to have some sauce on your rice, drizzle some of that rotisserie chicken sauce on it or even the hot sauce. 3/5  Salad - Freshly made with iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and chick peas, with your choice of dressing.  We had the balsamic which went nicely with the rest of our meal. 4/5  [Dessert]  Custard Tart - Haven't had Portuguese tarts in a while but these were unbelievable.  I'm actually tempted to make a drive out now and get some.  If you're full from your meal, I would recommend getting some to go. You can get a pack of 6 for $9."}
{"text":"_____when My family and I went here for lunch yesterday. We were struggling to make a decision where to eat lunch until my mother suggested for us to have churrasco.   _____atmosphere (4/5) The place looks great. The set up of the tables, the cute decorations (plates and the nice mural of Lisbon) makes the place very inviting.  _____food (3.5/5) The food was actually good. It arrived fast which was surprising and they served some hefty ass portions. Dining with my parents always ends up us having a table full of food as my mom would always say \"sky is the limit\", which means, order as much as you want until you explode. We ordered the Family Meal (#1); which was for $25. It included rice, mixed veg, parisian potatoes and a whole chicken. I wanted to be a fatty so I asked my mom to order me some fries too because I seen in the menu that they make them fresh, as in, they cut them real potatoes and fry them. I CANNOT EXPRESS how much I appreciate that. I looooove fresh cut fries and this place does them. However, the chicken was just alright. It was tasty, but I know I've tasted better. Bairrada and Churrasco of St.Clair are definitely tastier. I think it would've been better though if we asked them to put the sauce on the chicken instead on the side, which could've made a lot more difference. Maybe next time.  _____service (5/5) GREAT. Girlfriend who served us was very attentive and catered to us very well. My mom can be quite difficult to serve and she was very patient. She was pleasant and made the experience really great.  _____overall experience (4/5) Yeah I definitely will come back. It's not that far from my house. I know I've tasted better food but their FRIES. PLEASE. Don't get me started. Also the chicken is okay. The fact that I do not have to go all the way to Forest Hill or Little Portugal for this, and the fact that this is close to Scarborough, will def make me want to go back.   xxoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"Delicious rotisserie chicken and the potatoes are to die for. If you like spice get the whoop ass sauce on the chicken."}
{"text":"I'm sorry nice staff, but this is not Portuguese churrasco chicken, not even close.  The chicken is warm at best, no grill marks or that famous taste of char and piri piri.  They use warming table where everything is already made.    We ordered the half chicken and got it in like 2 minutes. With soggy potatoes, mushy rice and this weird concoction of cabbage and broccoli.   Churrasco places usually take time. You see the grill going and smoke from the lovely chicken pieces.  half chicken with pop $16, take a pass.  off to st. clair west again for the real thing.  note: they were busy so i'm happy for them, but if you've had the real deal before you will be very disappointed  with this rendition  note 2:  the Portuguese couple beside us had the seafood platter special and left more then half on the plate."}
{"text":"Churrasco serves up a variety of Portuguese eats from sandwiches to soups, chicken to seafood.  The dining space is fresh, clean, bright with dainty accents.   I had the half grilled chicken.  It came with some potato balls, steamed veggies and rice.  The chicken was topped with Piri Piri sauce which wasn't horribly flavourful in my opinion.  The chicken itself, not dry but not moist, sides were simple but good.  Overall, I would stop by again if needed a semi-healthy bite in the area but it's nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot whenever I'm in the area. Their food doesn't knock me off my socks mind you but the staff are eager to please and are welcoming and friendly.  That is why I keep going back..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner (to go) from Churrasco Portugril on Saturday night. It was really good. I had their special: the \"Drunken Piggy\" sandwich. Pork, cheese, chorizo & apple butter. Yum! My bf had their rotisserie chicken with rice & veggies. He said it was better than Swiss Chalet (huge praise for him) but he said he'd get it \"spicy\" next time. The people we super nice. Not fancy, but a nice looking place. I hope they consider adding delivery to their service offering at some point."}
{"text":"I miss this place been going here since 2006 when it first opened at birchmount and danforth. but now they moved which sucks. good chicken here you need to try it! Joe is very friendly and so is the staff. My personal favorite is the Prego. Steak sandwich  with cheddar mushrooms jalpeno peppers you guys need to try it  it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My old employers used to buy food from here quite often. They used to get the Piri Piri Chicken, vegetables and potatoes. The food was good but nothing spectacular. The place is  clean and has that Portuguese style look. I've been to Portugal before and the place resembles the type of tiles that you would typically find in Lisbon. Overall, the price for the food is decent and it is definitely a place you should try if you like Piri Piri Chicken. They have a lot of customers that pickup, so it was not very packed. A plate of piri piri chicken, rice, potatoes and salad will cost you a little less than $15."}
{"text":"Super boring and unseasoned rice and chicken and potatoes. Very expensive and blah for what you pay for. You can get a rotisserie chicken and fries and rice from any place for half the price and ten times the taste."}
{"text":"Got the 1/4 chicken dinner with no drink. 13 dollars for the smallest piece of dark meat imaginable and sides that were barely edible. I didn't touch the veggies because they were too soft and mushy, and the rice tasted like it was cooked yesterday. Potatoes were nothing special, could get those at any Portuguese place. Same goes for that tiny piece of chicken, it was average at best. The reviews I read are surprising, not sure if I came straight the wrong time of day?  I service was friendly, but not very informative at all... I seemed to pay the same price for my dark meet combo that I would've paid for white?"}
{"text":"Churrasco Portugril from my knowledge is one of the rare Portuguese Churrasco restaurants in this part of Scarborough.  As far as I know, the other choices nearby are either Pizza Pizza or Wimpy's.  As I walked inside with that recognizable Churrasqueira environment of exciting multi-color decor and this one even had a Portuguese mural on the wall(with a woman walking towards you).  The staff are absolutely welcoming friendly group of Gentlemen behind the ordering counter.  (+0.5 *Star*)  Another unique quality to this shop is the items they have on their Menu(Piri Piri Wings, Pork 'n Cheese Sandwich, Slawpy Joe, etc...) that other Churrascos do not have.  (+0.5 *Star*)  1/4 Grilled Chicken Meal($9.49) IMHO is slightly pricier than I would like but that's because I'm willing to travel while locals might not have that option.  If I live or work nearby, I would welcome this place as an additional Food selection a bit more.  The Grilled Chicken was taken out from the oven NOT the Swiss-Chalet type Rotisserie which is another one of their Chicken option.  It was cut up and slathered with my selection of Sauce(HOT).  It was more of a Salsa Tomatoey base sauce than the Wet Oily ones I've had but the heat was still noticeable.  The Tomato Rice Pilaf side was OK while the Parisian Potatoes had some additional seasoning lightly sprinkled on.  Might go for the Fries next time.  As I sign my Credit Card receipt, the man tells me to take the Pen which surprised me. Then he put a Calendar on top of the Pen.  I had my hands full taking my Meal, Drink, Pen, Calendar, Receipts to my table.  Note: Hot sauce is on the counter for your pleasure if more is needed."}
{"text":"I heard about it from a friend but never had the need to really come here...just because it's sort of in a random area that we don't rly spend any time there. So on a random evening we decided to try this place because we wanted to try a different chicken place and we were absolutely not going to Nandos. We went in to the restaurant, it was quiet. Lots of seating available. We ordered a family meal for around 25$. Just because of our previous experience with Nandos and their portion sizes we were not sure how this place was with theirs.   Let me tell you...SO MUCH FOOD. For the price it was SO worth it! Plus they all came in takeout containers so no need to waste plates. The only difference that I was expecting was a piri piri flavour that Nandos had.   Our meal came with : -bread -roasted potatoes -fries -whole chicken -rice  Well worth every penny. The staff are super nice too! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved it so much went the next day after my first visit. Got roasted veggies, potatoes, and rice for dinner. I also got a sandwich pulled chicken and coleslaw. ...very good"}
{"text":"Seafood plate was not good calamari was rubbery the shrimp was over cooked .. The soup was good. The piri piri sauce was not authentic. My friend had The slawpy Joe was okay."}
{"text":"Open concept restaurant where you can see the chicken roasting on the rotisserie and the staff preparing your meal. Atmosphere is relaxed, restaurant is clean and bright: loved the colorful tile. Noticed lots of people coming in to pick up large take out orders, also many Portuguese customers eating in.  We ordered the following: - Drunken Pig Sandwich combo (salad with vinaigrette dressing and Sumol Passionfruit Soda) - salad fresh, sandwich delicious and flavorful, soda tasty. - New Prego Sandwich (fries and bottled water) - steak tender a little bland but perfect after hubby added the piri piri sauce. Fries were awesome! The type you get at a fish & chips place and yes they had malt vinegar! - Custard tart (from Nova Era a Portuguese bakery)  very soft, consistency between a custard and pudding, shell hard. Sweet, needed some coffee to go with it.  - Cafe Latte made from Nespresso coffee - strong, goes well with sweet desserts.  Plus points: - all bread and desserts are fresh, baked daily and are sourced from the Portuguese bakery Nova Era. - They sell Sumol a carbonated fruit juice which is a drink option included in their combos: a nice break from pop. - attentive and courteous staff  TIPS - phone ahead for take out orders to avoid the wait - taste is relative, follow the reviewers who have similar tastes as you. - it's not fast food, sit down and enjoy the company you're with."}
{"text":"Churrasco Portugril is this small Portugese Chicken place and is really the only one in the vicinity from what I could find on Yelp. Being a big fan of Portugese chicken and having moved closer to the area, I was hoping this place could be a staple. The restaurant itself is pretty nice on the inside and out. They have a counter that runs along the front of the restaurant, but I was here for takeout.   Half Portugese Chicken with a choice of three sides (veggies, parisian potatoes, fries, and tomato rice pilaf). The Portugese chicken was done OK. The chicken was slightly charred on the outside and real nice and juicy inside (chicken breast was a bit dry though). The sides were nothing really special, especially since I got so many tomatoes - my choice, so I'm not blaming anyone. The chicken is OK enough, but not enough to warrant repeat visits though.  Staff is very friendly and the place itself is big enough if you want to come with friends. Other than their individual combo meals, they also have family meals that look pretty good (not that I would eat one all by myself or anything....). Not as good as other places I've been but selection for Portugese chicken is slim pickings around these parts"}
{"text":"Having just got back from Portugal, I was on the hunt for some authentic Churrasco chicken.   Firstly, the decor is impressive. Unless you've actually been to Portugal, I don't really think that you can appreciate the authenticity and effort they've taken to make it as Portuguese as possible.   The place is new, modern, and super clean. The staff are EXTREMELy friendly (like most Portuguese people) but went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience.   We ordered the half chicken, which came with 2 sides. We opted for the grilled chicken and it was spot on. Tender, well marinated and simply delicious. They offer a slew of sauces on the sides and I tried them all. The spicy was my favourite, because I always like to kick it up a notch, but they were all devious in their own right.   The potatoes were also extremely delicious.  We had some tarts for dessert (nata) and they were very good as well. My only recommendation is that they slightly warm them up before serving (as we were spoiled in Portugal).   All in all - a simply fantastic meal at a very reasonable price - with extremely friendly family service with a smile!  Obrigado!"}
{"text":"Nice greetings, clean space, food is just meh, nothing really jumped out at me here."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a long time. Finally had an opportunity to check it out. Extremely friendly helpful staff. Asked what they recommended and decided to check out their Pulled pork and cheese. Just the bun alone sold me quickly on the idea. Wish i knew the bakery they got those from, it held up real nice to the pulled pork. Quite a tasty sandwich. Definetely filling. Put on some of their medium hot sauce and it gave it a nice tang.  Should have took a picture because i feel the picture they have pictured doesn't do it justice.  Maybe next time. Definitely be back to dig a little deeper into the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna do it............give a five star rating to a restaurant. Yep I am. I'm always so hesitant to give restaurants five stars, why? No idea.  Maybe I feel like giving five stars makes me feel like the  teacher that gives everyone A's for effort or maybe there is always something that bothered me....don't know. But as my boyfriend and I were eating here Saturday night we could not think of one reason why this place shouldn't get a five star rating. The price is extremely reasonable. The food- DELICIOUS (churrasco chicken is always good but this one seemed even tastier....and if you want a little bit of fatty heaven get their custard tarts!). Portions were way more than enough. Staff very friendly. The decor is as is should. It's not a fine dining/date night establishment but doesn't claim to be or need to be. Everything was perfect. It gets the five stars and if you go get the custard tarts (even if you're full....your belly will thank you later)."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and has s couple of table to dine in. My partner and I opt for take out. We both got the 1/4 churrasco chicken ($10.25) with their own house made sauce choosing from mild to hot. The sauce is amazing! The customer service at the front is good as well. Overall it was okay, nothing to rave about. If I was in the area again and craving this I will come by again."}
{"text":"Bread is amazing, rice and potatoes are good. Chicken I was not impressed with...  Maybe with no sauce it tastes better?!?  Who knows. Decent price, but dont think i'd do the Family pack again."}
{"text":"The only thing I enjoyed was the decor. Everything else about this restaurant was awful. My partner and I shared the half rotisserie chicken dinner and the seafood platter. Both were pretty terrible. The potatoes were piping hot and everything else tasted cold and re-heated. The seafood was apparently grilled fresh but it was rubbery and had no grilled flavour whatsoever. The chicken was okay but we did not enjoy our meal. There was little to no service. They yell out your order and hand you your plate of food over the counter, then you walk to the other side of the \"restaurant\" to pick up your own silverware. I was hoping they didn't expect us to pick up our plates after and wipe the table because we just got up and left. Bleh, skip it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my son's sandwich was about 3 times more bread than filling and was pretty dry. He couldn't even eat it. In addition, we had wanted to eat in, but they packed up our meal in containers and bags and we both felt a little odd about sitting down and unwrapping it all right there so we took it home where it was no longer really all that hot. When I ordered it to stay and enquired about Piri Piri sauce, the woman behind the counter pointed out bottles of it we could try on our food without having to buy our own bottle that day, but because they packaged it all up, I couldn't even do that."}
