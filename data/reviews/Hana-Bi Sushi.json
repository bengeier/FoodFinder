{"text":"On a recent visit, I was disappointed to find that the food quality and value seems to have to taken a dive compared to a few years ago. I remember when I used to frequently enjoy their bento box lunch specials, their portions were quite generous and it included the usual generic non-raw sushi rolls (which I don't care too much for), sashimi, my favorite Tempura Yam Roll, a fried dumpling, and a bunch of fried tofu. On multiple occasions, the sushi chef even made me hand rolls on the house!  I went back again after a long while and was disappointed to find things have changed... - The amount of sushi they serve with the lunch specials is down to just the generic sushi rolls, which were very subpar and tasteless. - There was not as many fried tofu as before. Also, both the fried dumpling and tofu were quite cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while before being served to me. - Some of the few select side dishes that I usually order have gone down in quality and up in price. For instance, chicken yakitori was very hard and dry (I used to enjoy this dish but it was so difficult to chew), and takoyaki was way overpriced and tasted frozen.  It pains me to say these things about this place because the people who run the place are very nice and the atmosphere is pleasant and humble, but I just did not leave satisfied the same way I used to before. I should also mention that this review is based on multiple recent visits so I could be sure it wasn't just an isolated bad experience. Now I will likely consider other places in the area before I choose this place again unless things improve.  Previous rating for before would have been 3.5 stars: Good food for great value. Not something out of this world, but leaves me happily full after a meal."}
{"text":"I usually rate my food on two criteria. How good it is, and how much is costs. Amazing food at low cost is the ideal,  but mind blowing food at twenty times the average cost is not a good return on investment, as it were. At hana-bi, you get great food for a low cost, but in its region it's the best there is.   We initially tried this place a while back when they had the buy two rolls, get one free special. Since then I've been back almost once a week for the past 2 years. They have the best sushi in its price range. You can get great sushi for $10-15 a roll, and the service, while not absolutely legendary, it is nice. Don't come here expecting world class service, decor and food. Come here for good sushi, decent service, at an affordable price. The rolls are filling, well made, and absolutely to die for. My personal favourite is the mountain roll, but i also recommend any of their torched sushi, polar bear roll, beautiful roll and tataki roll."}
{"text":"I've come here twice and had a different experience both times. The first was dinner, we ordered the Omakase for two and was great, the food tasted good, presentation was amazing and the staff and chefs were too busy watching soccer on the TV but service was still Ok.   Second time I went out was for lunch and we both had bento. The food this time was not good. The fried tofu and gyoza were cold (and we were the only customers at that time!) the sashimi was warm and didn't taste fresh. The maki were sloppily made as well. And again, the staff were too busy watching soccer. Also when the waitress saw we were done she just came and handed us our bill without asking if we wanted the ice cream that came with the bento. I also had a very bad tummy ache not one hour after eating there.   Needless to say, we aren't going to be coming here again."}
{"text":"This is one of our friend's fav place to enjoy sushi, so we gave it a try today. On a Saturday, we're lucky that it was not as busy. We ordered their 'Love Boat' 75pcs.  Sashimi: salmon, tuna, butterfish, tai(seabream). Sushi: salmon, tuna, butterfish, unagi, uni Maki Rolls: one was tuna mixed, one was spicy salmon roll, and one special dynamic roll with salmon..  This fed us four, but its b/c 3 members weren't that hungry. I'd say it was not bad, but I had better sushi joints in the city. Seating capacity is about 50 possibly so reserve if you wanna give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Chefs often give on the house sushi with your meal.  Yummy green tea ice cream to finish.  Fresh sushi.  Great people."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week with a friend. We both ordered from their lunch bento box menu. From a price perspective, it's phenomenal, but from the taste point of view, I can only give them 1 star. I ordered a pork katsu, it comes with some california rolls / salmon roll. The rolls were not too fresh, especially the salmon one....it tastes terrible, I didn't even finish the second roll. I felt a little sick after the lunch, although I wasn't too sure if its the restaurant or I was sick to begin with. The pork katsu was dry and very thin...service was okay."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good sushi and surprised us with various on the house items."}
{"text":"1) Didn't get order right.  2) Served only one cup of tea for two seated guests. 3) Salmon teriyaki tasted old and left an undesirable aftertaste the whole day. 4) Service was slow.  Pretty terrible experience."}
{"text":"Went with 6 other people and we ordered a boat of sushi. The people there were really friendly and they gave us complimentary salad.   Food is good considering the price, similar quality to an all you can eat sushi place"}
{"text":"ugh love this place. food is good, not extrodinary, but good. not extremely expensive but it's decent. sometimes they even give you a free roll! really love the service tho, it's really excellent.  got the sashimi bento for lunch and took only 10 mins to come, which isn't half bad. it tasted good and the tea is great.  plusss, you get green tea icecream. how great is that?"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hanabi! The food is great, the place is cozy, and the people are super friendly! Some of my faves include the crunch roll, green dragon roll, seaweed salad and Kalbi. It's a plus that they serve complimentary salad, miso soup, and green tea ice cream after dinner. The sushi rolls are overall amazing; the rice is cooked just right and the flavors blend together so well. Hanabi is definitely underrated but it is a jewel in Markham and a must try. Plus it is always nice to be greeted when you enter and leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was excited to try this place because of the high ratings but was extremely disappointed at the quality of the sushi.  We ordered some of their special rolls, the Beautiful, Black Dragon ,  Crunchy, Orange Dragon, Tataki and another roll. They all looked similar and tasted similar as well...  The avocado in all the rolls was raw, meaning hard avocados with no avocado taste. I have eaten a lot of sushi and never have I had sushi with raw avocado...  They fell apart easily as well.   We also had the beef sashimi and the tuna tataki which was mediocre... The beef was sliced way to thick, and was chewy.   The service was painfully slow.  There was only one waitress. The poor waitress was buzzing around and I saw customers getting the menu instead of being served. I feel bad for the waitress... And the other customers that were there tonight.   Things were edible... That's about it... Definitely not going to give this another chance."}
{"text":"We got the LoveBoat ~ sushi and sashimi platter. There was even sea urchin sushi!! The fish is fresh, sushi freshly made. The chef even gave us some complimentary hand rolls. We also got the tempera dinner, freshly fried shrimp and veggies. The panko batter was thin and crispy, We were really full. We also got green tea ice-cream for dessert. I haven't had that for a long time, good dessert to end the meal."}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly atmosphere. Cheerful, attentive service. Fresh, succulent sushi. You can eat well for under $15."}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant with a group of 14 people.  The restaurant was about 15-20% full and we were willing to split up, but we were told our group was too big and they would not accept us.  Extremely rude service and would not recommend."}
{"text":"We have been here many times for sushi. The food is okay for the price. However, the last time we came for lunch it was awful. The service was slow. We ordered two lunch specials and the black dragon roll. They forgot to remove the plastic wrapper on the black dragon roll. The worst part was, the chef did not even offer to make us a fresh one. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Used to be better... The sashimi would be bigger and sushi had less rice... I ordered B1 Love boat (sushi and sashimi) on Dec 31, 2012. and I was not impressed. The uni was not fresh at all.. I ordered something called tataki Sa roll.  That was not bad..."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 8.5/10 Overall experience: 8.5/10  Hana-Bi is a small restaurant located in the First Markham Place plaza. I've been going for a number of years, and even seen it through a change in management, but still feel the same about the place.   The sushi is good - it's not the best you're going to get, but it definitely is quality. The udon is really fantastic, I would highly recommend!  The service is great. The waitresses are always friendly. The decor is as you would expect in a Japanese restaurant. It's clean, however, a big plus when it comes to any Asian spot.   THE BOTTOM LINE: it's no Tokyo-quality sushi, but it's good all the same!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to hanabi but lately the service has not been as great as before. I stopped going to their restaurant because I actually saw a small cockroach once we told the waitress and she was to slow to catch it and it disappeared. It freaked us out and the waitress or anyone didn't do anything for us ... Not even apologize. That was the last time I went to hanabi and I would not go back. They also had a tendency to give you the check without it being asked so they can push you out of the seat so they can give it to another customer. That's what my boyfriend hated the most and refuses to go back ever. Also I think they changed management and the sushi was not as good as before. Bye hanabi."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer of this restaurant. Owned by Korean shef. He is very nice and gives us free food everytime. The food taste is good. I Like their rolls. Crunch roll, Tataki rolls are good choice."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Don't come here. Never have a left half a sushi/sashimi boat unfinished. Piece of uni sushi still on it as well"}
{"text":"Since I've been here a few times already, I finally decided that I should write a review for this place. To be honest, there isn't really a lot of Japanese a la carte options in the area of Markham. When it comes to Japanese, there are times that I crave specialty maki rolls or bento boxes and Hana-Bi comes to mind as it is close by and affordable pricing.   It is a tiny restaurant and I enjoy the peacefulness of the place as I can have quality conversations with my friends over our meal. Tonight, both my friend and I ordered bento boxes for dinner. I ordered the sashimi and kalbi bento. I love it, it was the perfect portion. The meal also came with miso soup and salad. But if you're hoping for a complimentary dessert (scoop of icecream or something), you're out of luck. Honestly, had the meal came with a dessert, it woulda topped it off.   All in all, I enjoyed the service even though there was only one server. I would recommend this place to those in the area."}
{"text":"Where's the 0 stars button? The food was good. Salmon Combo with 6 Sashimi, 6 Sushi and 6 Rolls for only $13.99. But things took a turn for the worse. Now I know why it's so cheap. The sushi chef was constantly coughing on to the food he was prepping without covering his mouth or anything. That is disgusting. I question how sanitary the food is that I just ate. This is Ontario, you're given legislated sick days. He should have stayed home or the very least warn a face mask. Not coming back."}
{"text":"One of my go-to à la carte sushi places. It's a small restaurant but the food is good and affordable, staff are friendly, and service is good. You get complimentary soup, salad, and green tea ice cream when you go for dinner. They also still serve soft-shell crab and spider rolls, which is hard to find nowadays."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & had a great experience!   Highlights:  1) affordable 2) complimentary extras: salad, miso soup, green tea ice cream (!)  3) friendly service 4) vegetarian friendly (will substitute)  Quality of food itself = good although not exceptional, a bit low relative to the quality at other sushi restaurants. LOVED the yam rolls. Would recommend to anyone seeking to indulge their sushi cravings w/o spending too much $"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to sushi place. Reasonable prices and the quality is pretty good. 6 people, we ordered the medium love boat and 30 pc sashimi which was plenty!!! About 16$ a person , so quite worth it. Would recommend for group dinners!!!!"}
{"text":"Hana-Bi Sushi offers amazing value and the quality of the fish is good.  Servers are nice and always have a smile on their face. Chefs sometimes give out free hand rolls on the house which is pleasent.  I been here a couple times and I usually ordered the large maki roll platter 42 pieces for $24 which is an amazing value.   I have tried other special rolls as well and they were all so good.  You get salad, miso soup and green tea ice cream with your meal as well.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 4/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3.8/5 ... Decent price for decent quality. Friendly staff Cozy small shop    Only complain is that some of our sashimi pieces had a \" frozen texture \".   Everything else was smooth sailing.  Would recommend and revisit !"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the actual restaurant, but judging from my experience with them through UberEATS, it's just alright.  Wouldn't say their sashimi is too fresh, and sea urchins often had an odd texture and smell that tells you it's gone off yet still edible."}
{"text":"Hana-bi Sushi is a cozy little joint located in the First Markham Plaza. It is probably the smallest sushi venue I have ever been in, but I felt comfortable and was greeted kindly.   A fairly large menu was presented to me and I browsed through it whilst sipping green tea. I decided to take advantage of a lunch special as it contained a wide spread which would allow me to get a good feel of the chefs skills and quality of ingredients. My bento consisted of 2 salmon sushi, 2 red snapper sushi, 2 pieces of anonymous maki, 2 tempura rolls, a portion of bulgogi and some gyoza for $9.99.   I was excited to dig in, but disappointed that everything remained fairly at par. The sushi had more rice packed underneath then usual and there was no wasabi between the fish and rice. I like the temperature of my sushi to be cool and fresh, this was at room temperature and extra chewy. As for the bulgogi, I have eaten it almost everywhere and I have had much better. The gyoza was under and unevenly cooked and my bowl of rice was dry and I believe it was placed in the bowl long before it made it to my table.     I probably will not be returning to this restaurant, however this could have been just a one off experience I had. I have come across positive reviews online and some via word of mouth, I also feel the venue is homey and the service is good. Unfortunately, sushi can not hold a candle to other local gems like Tomo.   Dewa Mata."}
{"text":"This is a korean owned sushi place, so there are a few menu items with a clear Korean influence, such as the bulgogi/kalbi items for the bento as well as the Korean version of chirashi, which I forgot the name of right now. My bf and I ordered a sushi boat, and on the whole we were very disappointed. The rice for the sushi was already too moist, and the sushi chef (presumably someone new) wanted to ensure the roll was secure, so what we got was moist rice that was packed tightly into maki and nigiri rolls. Flavour wise, the rolls and the quality of the fish in general weren't bad. However I had the uni sushi, and it actually triggered a gag reflex. Since it was my first time having uni, I checked with my bf to see if it was supposed to taste like that, and he said what we had was far more fishy than it's supposed to be.  However, Hana-bi did redeem it self when they gave us complementary spicy salmon hand rolls, which I thought was a nice gesture.  Overall I was generally disappointed with my experience here, however I am willing to give this place another try with their bento items/ lunch menu since they looked like a great deal. Plus friendly service also helped to redeem the restaurant a little."}
{"text":"Came here today on Nov.3.2014 for lunch !!  The food tasted ok laa... it wasn't the best. But it was cheap !7.99 for lunch special bento box !! Came with a decent amount of food just enough to fill me up !!    The sashimi slices were very thin though and small... but not bad .  The california roll felt a bit empty..   Service was ok... they forgot to give us cups to pour our tea in.. but they apologized for it and that makes it better~   But will come again~ for lunch one day haha."}
{"text":"Our favourite go to sushi spot.  Always fresh sushi.   Good deal on the salmon special dinner for $14. Great tempura.  Friendly service. Hard working family business."}
{"text":"We got the dinner for two, which included a sizeable portion of the typical sashimi/sushi, some veggie tempuras, two pieces of tofu, shrimp tempura and yakitori, rice, and your choice of beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki. My favourite were the tempura, tofu and yakitori, which all came on one plate. The sushi and sashimi were decent, nothing too special. Most disappointing was the entrée (rice and meat teriyaki). The portions were TINY given that this was for dinner; I finished mine in about four bites.   Service was unimpressive. There was only one waitress there and she was often busy in the kitchen so there was a lot of waiting for our food, or to clear our plates.  Overall, it was an average experience. Might come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is great! They don't cheap out and just have a lot of rice. I just adore their rolls, and like previous reviews, I have received things on the house and the people here are so nice and friendly. Service is fast, and I will be coming here on my lunch break again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst sashimi and sushi I have in Toronto.  The sashimi is worse than T&T supermarket quality. Even my cat won't even touch them. The sushi is terribly make.  It taste very bad. It smells bad. It looks bad. The soy sauce don't taste like soy sauce. I cannot find a single item that is acceptable. It's reach to a level I'm worrying about my stomach will feel bad. Also missing order and still charge on the bill. Please DO NOT go this place."}
{"text":"I had a craving for sushi and we ended up here for a quick lunch. I had the bulgogi beef bento and the fiancé had a spicy sushi bento. We weren't impressed with the quality of sushi. One of my fiancé's tuna pieces had gone dry and he didn't feel comfortable eating it. When we have a la carte sushi, we expect a certain quality from it, as opposed to the mass produced all you can eat sushi. The sushi we got here was not even up to par with all you can eat sushi. The sushi are smaller than expected. The beef bulgogi was nothing to write home about. It kind of lacked the flavour you would expect from a bulgogi and it was kind of dry. My fiancé and I left unsatisfied with our meals. The server was very sweet, though."}
{"text":"I don't know if they're under new ownership but the portions became smaller and fish isnt as fresh. Lost my business. Goodbye Zen Box 9!"}
{"text":"Gosh, they are so friendly. All smiles. Happy to help if you want something not on menu. The ladies who serve have the most beautiful smiles.  The food is absolute fantastic. Huge rolls, with Rice very little, just right. Many other places rice is overwhelming (rice is cheap).  Parking gets a bit tricky in the huge parking lot after 5PM. There is always parking, you may have to walk a little through the parking lot.   I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Lunch special looks great however if you want anything else you're paying 10 bucks for a bento box.   It was okay."}
{"text":"I adore Hana-Bi, and it's not just because they've given me (and other patrons) free food from time to time. This place serves up consistent quality at a decent price every time I go. It is definitely a favourite sushi place for myself and my family.   First off, the sushi and sashimi. This place does sushi right, with large pieces of quality fish and seafood. The uni sushi (sea urchin) is definitely one of my favourites. It is always very fresh with an ample amount of sea urchin. Sashimi are thickly sliced. The rolls I've tried have also been very delicious with very beautiful presentation.For lunch, I usually grab the bento boxes. They always leave me stuffed and are a very decent price for lunch ($13-$15).    Service is friendly and quick. It's a small space but it never seems too crowded. The servers always greet you when you come in and make sure your tea cup is filled (which is always an indicator of good attentiveness). Definitely a great selection in a city with too many options.  (9/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I'm rather surprised. We were going to go to Shiso Tree for lunch, but they're closed on Mondays. We then decided it was either this or Kaka. Because we were already in front of the door, we came here. They have a lunch special that includes 7 pieces of sashimi, 4 pieces of nigiri, 6 pieces of maki, 2 gyoza, 1 agedashi tofu, soup, salad, and rice. The whole thing costs $8.99. It's rather impressive.  They're Korean-owned, and I have yet to be to a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant that has terrible quality. Is it the best quality? No. But neither will it give you food poisoning. They didn't skimp on the fish either.  For $10.99, I got the lunch bento that included tempura (2 shrimp, 5 veggie or something like that), 4 nigiri, 6 maki, 2 gyoza, 1 agedashi tofu, soup, salad, and rice. The tempura could have been lighter on the batter, but it still fixed my tempura craving. The rolls in both boxes were 4 California and 2 tempura yam. Oh. Speaking of tempura, one of my veggies was a piece of tempura orange pepper. That was interesting.  The lady who ran the front of the store was also rather sweet. When we walked in, we were the only people in the store. She asked if we had driven or we had walked, because it was cold outside. After lunch, she asked if whether we had work or school that day. It was a thoughtful gesture.  They also have specials plastered everywhere. I believe there was one that's a Korean ramyun and a dynamite roll for $8.99. There's another that runs from Mon-Thurs: Buy 2 maki, get 1 free. Oh. And I believe takeout is 10% off. Perhaps cash only. I forget.  For those who live close by, here's a fantastic place to get a cheap sushi fix."}
{"text":"Tried their food because hubby found a 20% off coupon and they deliver. We like the fact that they deliver but are glad we didn't have to pay full price. To start, the avocado and sweet potato rolls were good.  We were surprised to see Edamame beans on the house which was very nice of them. Their gyoza were OK too. However, rarely have I had fishy tasting California rolls. The shrimp tempura rolls' shrimp didn't taste very fresh either.  We were surprised to find our kid's chicken teriyaki dinner to be wrapped in saran wrap.  I would never put hot food in saran wrap!  Presentation there was a definite fail.  I understand that they were trying to keep the saucy chicken separate from the avocado rolls, but use a different container if that's the case.  It looked like the chicken was in a clear plastic bag. We would much rather go to Mi-Ne around the corner."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place besides all you can eat. For reasonable pricing, you can get quite a lot... even for large groups, it's quite filling! We went as a party of 6 and ordered the love boat of 50 pieces and sashimi of 30 pieces- fresh!! This comes with soup and salad which is not too bad! I would definitely come back and recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Hanabi and while their restaurant have undergone numerous changes over the years, I still enjoy their food to this day.    We went with the MC3 special roll platter which includes 5 special rolls for $45. That's a really good deal considering many places now charge close to $12-15 for special rolls. While the rolls don't look as good as Osaka's (and lack a bit of finesse), the quality and taste is still more than passable. It was still very much enjoyable. My favorites were the kamikaze and mountain rolls. The kamikaze featured spicy tuna while the mountain had spicy salmon. The best part was that these rolls featured mostly fish and not just breadcrumbs so good job Hanabi. It was also interesting to note their crunch roll had cream cheese in it too. The closest place I can think of sushi similar to Hanabi's is Akane Sushi.   I also tried their hwe dup bap and it was decent. I expected more from the veggies (it was the same as the salad they give you, no fancy spring mixes or spinach here), but the sashimi chunks seems to be quite good here, although it could have use a tad more fish.    Hanabi might seem like an average place, but it's still a nice, cozy small place to grab sushi and more at a decent price. And if you're near the First Markham Place area and are craving a simple bite, this place is also for you."}
{"text":"My friends and I have always loved Hanabi  Much like the other reviews before me, the restaurant has undergone many many changes but has always remained consistent.  My favourite owner was Woody who always made the most delicious specialty rolls for our family when we came in. He really made us feel like home.  That being said, the new owners are also extremely friendly and you always feel welcomed at Hanabi Great service. Great food. Definitely would recommend stopping by for lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot but ever since they changed owners the quality of the food went way down. Got the zen box for 15.99 with salmon teriyaki... the piece of salmon was charred to the point it tasted burnt. The sashimi in my box was also very thinly sliced...I understand if they wanted to be stingy with the tuna, but they cut the salmon thin as well. The only good thing about this place was the service. Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"Hana-bi is located in Woodside plaza at Woodbine and Hwy 7 behind the Cineplex theatre. I came here for lunch on a weekday and ended up with a bento box, a la sashimi. How I'm no expert in sushi, but I know a good bento box from experience.   The quality of the sushi was sub-par and pretty boring, I could see coming here if, say I worked across the street, but even a 5 minute drive isnt worth the effort.   Also, the service was just OK, nothing special here."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that has not already been said?    This is your true mom&pop sushi restaurant, run by a Korean family with an all Korean staff, naturally.  Their menu consists of the basic sushi dinners and Korean staples such as bulgogi and kalbi bento boxes. I've been coming here for years!  They have a great lunch menu deal that's all under $10 - and their service is quick, their staff are quick and attentive, overly friendly with a smile!   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but when I want some good decent, dependable sushi this place comes to mind!  I definitely prefer this place over Nakwon which is also located in the same plaza for Korean food as well.  A cozy, comfortable sushi joint in a sea of a Chinese restaurants at FMP, this place should be on your list for when you need that Japanese and Korean food fix while in Markham!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best sushi places in the area in terms of price, and service. I've been on a quest for the past 6 months to find good, cheap sushi around my work at Hwy 7 and Leslie and I think I've finally found the place!   This isn't a large restaurant and it's packed with tables but the service is quick and friendly especially at lunch when we had to wait ~5-10 min for a table. They were apologetic for the wait and ended up offering us a free dish for hanging around! OK maybe I'm a sucker for free food but I haven't received service this good in a LONG while.  In terms of price, you can easily have lunch here under $10, there's bento's and teriyaki dishes at $6.99 and $9.99 and sushi platters starting from $10.99 (for 14 pieces). It is also Korean owned so they do have a few korean dishes and soju specials but regardless their sushi rolls were by far better than any other sushi joint around (better than Wasabi, Gals, Inaho, Sapporo, etc - except maybe not Miyabi). Don't expect to be WOW'ed at the freshness of the fish but all in all it's a clean place, with great service, fair prices and tasty food.   I guess there's a reason this place is always packed for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as an alternative to Osaka sushi restaurant in Markham.   I have always been a fan of hanabi but haven't been in quite a long time.  Special rolls were quite good. Their hae du bap was standard. Nothing stood out. Could have used more spicy gojujang sauce mixture.   Service was good considering the number of customers in the restaurant. But it slightly got worse when more customers came later in the evening.   If you love special rolls and don't want to pay as much as you do in Osaka then this is the perfect restaurant to come to. It will save you a couple dollars per special roll and comparable in taste and freshness of fish."}
{"text":"We ordered love boat (30 pieces) for two.  Fish was quite fresh but the cut was not very good.  We found bones in unagi and salmon and there's also tough connective tissue in salmon.  Fish pieces were also smaller  I believe there are other sushi restaurants that offer better value"}
{"text":"Very standard sushi, good prices considering the location (compared to downtown) but quality is like a good AYCE place:  Tempura is overbattered but everything tastes good when it's deep fried. Fish may not be fresh but who knows it's all covered in spicy mayo. So really, it's all good."}
{"text":"Hanabi has become one of my go-to sushi restos in Markham. The prices are right and the quality is good. Sometimes they'll serve complimentary salmon skin hand rolls and deep fried tofu (fresh and crispy)!  The SERVICE is excellent. You're always greeted at the door by all the staff. The waitresses are very attentive and very polite.. and cute. The food comes out pretty quickly as the sushi chefs are constantly crafting.  The ATMOSPHERE is quite Japanese inspired. Lots of light wood finish with Japanese art. But as others have mention it's a tight area for a Markham resto but you can get around just fine. If it were located downtown it would be more acceptable.   The FOOD is fresh every time I've gone which can very from weekend to weekday. Everyone I've taken are happy with the food. My favourite is the Hae Dup Bap. Fresh sashimi on salad and a bowl of rice with BimBamBap hot sauce. Amazing in the summer. You'll be full and won't be over heated. Comes in under $14 for the dinner size. The bento boxes are great too at $15. Both come with a small Japanese noodle in soup, salad and miso soup. Also note that the green tea has toasted rice in it which adds a little bit of flavour."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this cozy restaurant on a Monday night and glad we did. The restaurant was dead and we did not have to wait for seat. Majority of their customers came for takeout. We ordered the tatiki roll, hanabi roll, gyoza & the kalbi beef sizzling plate. The waitress was really friendly and gave us complementary miso soup, salad and rice which was really heartwarming. The rolls were very good and I definitely recommend getting them. The gyoza was a little overcooked as it was really hard and the kalbi beef was decent at most.   Overall, it was a cute cozy place - will probably visit again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Really love the sushi at this restaurant. The pieces are a good size (not monstrous) and the quality is very good. The restaurant is pretty small so the line up for me took 15 mins or so at dinner for 2 people"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner about a month ago on a Friday night with my family of 5. The restaurant was a small place, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes without a reservation. I've been here a few times and have had a good experience consistently.   We were craving sushi, so we ordered a huge boat of sushi. We were each given a small bowl of salad and miso soup soon afterwards. The soup didn't have that msg aftertaste you'd find at some places, and the dressing on the salad was just right; not too sour, not too sweet, not too bland, not too much. The sushi came in about 10 minutes, and for the amount that we ordered, that was pretty fast. We had an assortment of raw fish, including no tuna and hamachi, as well as raw squid, avocado, and sea urchin. All of it tasted fresh and delicious. The sushi didn't have too much rice like some places, and the fish servings were adequate. We also got a soft shell crab roll, which had avocado, cucumber and cream cheese. My family didn't like the cream cheese in it but I thought it was good so I ate all of it.  What I find stood out to me was that every time I've went with my family, they always bring us something random that's on the house. I'm not sure if that's something they do often or just with larger groups. They use \"scrap\" pieces of fish such as the bits of meat missed when filleting a fish and make it into something delicious. This time, they made a hot dish of salmon pieces with onions, bean sprouts, carrots and sauce. The salmon was done well but had bones in it. It was free though so I can't really complain. It's a nice touch, and I like the idea of not wasting food.   Overall, this is probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants and I'd definitely come back another time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, around 8pm. There was only 1 table with customers, rest was all empty seats. (Mind you, this place is usually jam-packed with people waiting in line!)  We ordered two rolls; Crunch and Orange Dragon, and a sashimi boat.  They made a terrible decision of serving all these on the same plate (boat), which resulted in missing sauce for the rolls and missing three pieces of sashimi when we order a total of 30.  The sashimi were insanely small and thinly sliced, you actually can't really taste them because they were so miniature.   The only up to standard food was the tempura, the batter was fresh and fluffy.   Reading through other people's comment, I believe they've changed ownership. The quality of food has gone way down, and it really shows in the lack of customers.   I will definitely look for other sushi places because there is no way I'm coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Was debating on what to have for lunch yesterday and decided to walk around the outside of First Markham Place and look at the menus that each restaurant has to offer. I remember walking by Hanabi-Sushi and saw that they had a couple of hand written promotions posted on their windows. The first being buy 2 maki rolls and get 1 free and the second one was a lunch special valid for Monday- Thursday 8.99 for one dynamite roll and 1 bowl of Ramyun (Spicy Korean Instant Noodles). I thought that it was a pretty good deal and went in. Was automatically greeted because the place is a tad small. Very authentic Korean/Japanese restaurant. Waitress came over and I had indicated that i wanted the promotion on the window. She wasn't aware of the promotions and had to ask Kitchen. So i thought that was kind of a downer. Nonetheless, she placed the order for me and my dynamite rolls were made fresh and delivered to be in less than 5 mins. Their dynamite rolls were lacking in colour. Lots of rice and the seaweed didn't seem to stick together. What i do like is that their rice was still warm. When i say lacking in colour, i mean that they didn't provide enough of the stuffing that the dynamite roll is made of.   My Ramyun came and it was indeed the Korean Spicy Instant Noodles just a little dressed up. They added some seaweed, mushrooms, peppers and onions to the bowl.   Sure, it was satisfying, though, the deal isn't that great. I could've bought the instant noodles at the grocery store and ordered a much nicer dynamite roll from elsewhere.   All in all, might be back, but food was meh."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count, before and after the Japanese restaurant at this location changed management.  Hana-bi is a new management in place a few years ago.  Throughout the years, this restaurant has been a rare survivor in a sea of all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Japanese restaurants in Markham/Richmond Hill areas.  The quality of raw dishes, such as sushi, sashimi and rolls, is consistent: better than most AYCE, but won't blow you away.  The prices won't blow you away neither.  So it is a fairly valued Japanese restaurant, especially if your food of choice is raw.  If you prefer cooked food, such as teriyaki anything and all things, the value is superb.  Good food fairly priced.  Service is sufficient."}
{"text":"This place is at best mediocre. I used to come here all the time. They used to give out chef's compliments which is a usually a handroll or sushi. I think owners may have changed, that, or inflation.  Anyway, fish is not the freshest, and not much selection, just the basic salmon, white tuna, octopus. It's not worth the price, imo. Lunch specials are not bad.  I would only come here when I'm too lazy to go anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"I remember coming here since about 2008, 2009?  I think at the time, it was a great alternative for the numerous Japanese restaurants out there.  It was simple, a la carte and nothing more.  I think this restaurant hadn't aged well.  One of the most interesting things that brought me to write something about this place was that I've always thought it was good enough you don't have to say too much, people still flocked over here.  Look at the number of check-ins, reviews and tips, and you can see: this place is quite good.  So, why have I suddenly felt the urge to start writing?    Simple, this place has changed now.  Meals here always were simple and quick, with a Yakult yogurt drink.  Times have definitely changed, I know everything is more expensive, but those are a thing of the past.  But what has made things a lot worse nowadays is that the food quality has drastically decreased.  The speed at which food is being delivered is rather slow.  There's a lot of fuss and bustling about in the kitchen, and behind the sushi bar, but it seems like food isn't coming out that quickly.  In the past there were two chefs working behind the sushi bar, now it's down to the work of one person.  I'm guessing that is the reason they've been giving out the salmon's head out on the house to keep people from getting too hungry.  While we were there, two other people had ordered takeout, and they've been around for quite a while.  Our order didn't get out much quicker based on that progression.  So, now that the food we ordered finally got to us, we weren't too thrilled though, and the wait was not justified at all.  For lunch, our order was 3 lunch specials, 1 each of L1, L2, and L3.  The sushi rice was unfortunately dry, the seaweed (sorry, the nori) was soggy, there was no pickled ginger, and the pieces were just tiny.  Pair that with some dry rice, well, it wasn't that great.  Then came the question of the food that came out with the rest of our lunch.  L2 and L3 orders were chicken teriyaki.  The food in general was cold.  Considering a restaurant where they really cranked the heat on a day that was cold for April (7 feeling like 3), I was surprised the chicken teriyaki was dry and cold, the fried tofu was soggy as well cold.  The sweet sauce on the tofu that caused the sogginess?  That was cold too.  The vegetables that came with the chicken teriyaki wasn't cooked well enough, so a few of the onions were a bit on the raw end.  The rice was also dry here, and cold.  We heard a few beeps of the microwave, so I'm not sure if the chicken teriyaki was heated that way, although I won't be surprised if it did.  What we can tell though, was that the dryness of the rice is likely a result of being pre-scooped and just left sitting there for a while.  Ok, the food wasn't stellar, but why only 1 star?  The pass, i.e..the window where food comes from the kitchen to the dining room, is visible to many diners.  A few diners (including one from my party) noticed someone taste-testing the soup for the ramen, and subsequently putting the same used spoon into the ramen bowl.  Whoops.  Something else that a member of my party pointed out was that they weren't entirely careful about the way they handled food.  It's these sort of things that causes you to lose your ease of eating out.  I know no kitchen is perfect, and you're bound to run into a lot of restaurants where the food handlers aren't perfect, but the part where we are able to see the faults being made is much more traumatizing.  I don't know what happened in the short period of time between everyone's mid-level reviews in January of this year, and today, but things have gone down a lot.  Yes, there's that one unusual 4 star review from April this year, but it seems to be trending downwards.  I used to think this place was consistent enough and didn't need me to write about it to boost its attending numbers, but it seems like the team working the food has lost the touch the previous teams had.  Part of me wants to come back and give them a second chance because of how great they always had been in the past.  However, after what I witnessed today, I'm inclined not to come back."}
{"text":"My favourite place for sushi!   As I've gotten older, I really come to appreciate these small, intimate sushi restaurants. For the most part, I don't like to get all you can eat anymore because the quality is not there.   Things I ALWAYS order at Hana-Bi:  1. Spider Roll 2. Seafood Udon   The sushi here is all good!!   The staff are always super friendly. I've been here a few times where the manager recognised me and actually gave my friends and I a complementary dish!   For lunch, no reservations are needed as it's generally not too busy. If you're having dinner around 6-7:30 I would make a reservation."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch special & a seaweed salad to go! The lunch special itself comes with a miso soup and a green salad.   Loved that it also came with some fried dumplings (was not expected)! Not 100% if the second tiny container of sauce was for the salad or for the dumplings, but still tasty either way.   The California rolls were a bit smaller than expected, but they definitely made up for that in the quality. The sashimi was cut into good portion sizes. The quality of the fish is superb.  Lunch special box: $8.99 Seaweed salad: $5.99"}
{"text":"I love eating here, I only eat salmon so when I change my sashimi or maki into salmon they sometimes mess up, but I'm cool about it. They will charge you a few dollars for the change, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and great lunch deals, but the sashimi isn't the freshest."}
{"text":"i think its one of the better sushi places in the area. (if you've read my reviews, i'm a NO GAL SUSHI), the food here is consistent. i've been a couple of times and get the same satisfaction everytime.   Today i went for lunch, and had their L1 which is their lunch special that comes with miso soup, salad and a bento box with sashimi and some rolls. the portions are SMALL!! but for the price, 8.99, i guess it was ok. its not the BEST thing in the world, but it satisfied me, and i dont think i should be eating too mcuh anyway, so the portions are ok. they will fill an asian girl not looking to be bloated  nothing fantastic, if you're looking for FANSTASTIC, dont come here. but if you're just looking for sushi, its a good place.   the restaurant is small, and they squished my friend and i to a table near the kitchen area when there were clearly other table opened. they wanted to make space for other 4 people groups, but we went when it was nearing the end of the lunch time, so that wasn't too smart of them."}
{"text":"My friends and I have decided to hit up Hana-Bi for some sushi last night while we were roaming around First Markham Place. It was relatively quiet for a Sunday night around 7:30pm; we were the only table there. The ambiance was warm and cozy. The only odd thing was there was no background music that evening, so you can literally hear what we were yapping about.  Hana-Bi had a huge selection of raw and hot foods on the menu. There were a handful of items off menu written on blackboards and displays too (from BBQ Mackerel and Grilled Calamari to Udong and Bulgogi dishes).  We received complimentary miso soup and a plate of assorted tempura (shrimps and veggies) on the house - it was very nice of them. The tempura was delicious. The lady server was polite, courteous, and soft spoken. The food also came out quickly. The Sensual Pleasure Roll (LOL, right?) was tasty and it was a good specialty roll size. We enjoyed that very much.  The four of us also shared the SS1 platter with an assortment of Sashimi, Nigiri and Sushi Rolls. Taste was decent but the size of each piece of sushi and the cut of each sashimi were much smaller than what I normally would expect. I wonder if they ran out of fish and sushi rice this evening... or if this was actually their normal? The nigiri IMO was definitely not up to par - the fish did not stick to the rice when I picked it up, the rice was uneven and oddly shaped, and one of the fish was so small that it did not even cover the rice :\   Hana-Bi gotta up its game because even Aurora has better sushi now."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I've ever been. Me and my family go here all the time on the weekends. The sushi is not small and they don't break apart. The size is bigger than most and they're so friendly. A place where they don't charge you extra for the spicy mayo on on the side. All in all food is great and the staff are hospitable I recommend the special rolls! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place all the time years ago.  Just paid a visit yesterday & wasn't impressed with the downfall in quality of the sashimi.  Service wasn't too pleasant, chefs and waitress were watching soccer the entire time on really loud volume. (Their break time I guess)  Sashimi tasted dry, wasnt soft. Kind of like it was dried out with a paper towel (especially the tuna).  Beef overall was good, tofu was overly battered.   Don't think I will be coming back anymore.. pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"A small place but consistent each time. I usually go for lunch and everything taste freshly made. They are fast especially for take out and tables here flip over pretty fast.  Nothing unique to write about but a good place for bento and rolls of you're in the area. Prices are the going rate. They are running a salmon bento special 13.99 for what looks like a lot of salmon different ways.  There always seems to be 1 waitress at lunch but she is efficient at taking orders and removing plates.  Wifi password is same as login name"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi in Markham. I have been coming here for 8 years. The fish here is always very fresh and at great value. Strongly recommend the tataki rolls and hamachi negi roll.  Servers are pretty friendly here. The chef always send me free handrolls!!"}
{"text":"Smallest sushi I ever seen.  The sushi are so skinny.  I forgot to took pictures. Taste are normal.  Just like most other sushi places.  I tried it just be cuz I was at first Markham place, but I won't go again."}
{"text":"Forty dollars for 22 pieces of teeny poor quality sushi sashimi and rolls in a \"love boat\" for two persons. They don't even give a full six piece California roll .... Just three pieces. The menu said there would be uni. Guess what? No uni, no akagai, no mackerel....basic basic BASIC sashimi and sushi one should expect in a boat at that price. Ridiculous. I got home and had to cook myself a second dinner."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and always leave happy and full :)   The restaurant is quite small but you can usually get a spot within a quick wait. The sushi is always fresh and delicious and some of their rolls are really unique and yummy. I usually get their bento box which is the perfect thing to satisfy my sushi craving.   Service here is always excellent, the waitresses are always extremely pleasant and quick. The sushi chefs are really nice too and they usually give me a roll or appetizer or something on the house which is nice of them. The small bowl of green tea ice cream at the end of the meal is always the perfect touch of sweetness to leave me feeling happy and satisfied.   It's a really relaxed place that I go to when I just want good food and good company without the fuss. When I'm in the area this is usually where I recommend we go for sushi."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite frequently with friends until recently.  We were attracted to their very cheap bento lunch specials and cute family run business, but recently we found a cockroach in our meal.  We reported it to the owner, who immediately killed it with the tea pot.  I really like the cute family that runs this place, but I do worry about the cleanliness of the food now.  I am okay with hair in my food, but a cockroach is a cause for concern."}
{"text":"Hana-Bi Sushi is runned by a Korean family. I have to agreed with Bijan that it is the best lunch specials ($6.99) in terms of price in the area!!  What can one expect from $6.99?? Here at Hana-Bi Sushi will buy you  - green tea - miso soup - salad - bento box with 2 tempura tofu, 1 dumpling, 6 pc of Sashimi, 4 pc of Cali roll, 2 pc of big roll, 4 pc of sushi - yogurt drink as dessert - nice and friendly service  The restaurant itself is nice and comfy. The service is quick and friendly. The food is decent.  I will be definitely be back for a quick cheap lunch again! Just think how much T&T asking for one of their pre made nasty tasting sushi!  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac!"}
{"text":"Great gem in Markham!  Especially their lunch special is the best deal in town.  Not only is it priced great but the quality and quantity is unparalleled.  Highly recommended.  My favourite is their L2 lunch special."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Came here after my friend from Japan recommended this place... To be frank, the portion sizes were a lot smaller than I anticipated, and although the fish tasted fresh, I just wasn't impressed with the overall vibe I got from the food.   The staff were super friendly and the service was relatively quick. Ultimately, the environment is very comfortable, but unless you were looking for a sushi-craving satisfying lunch, I would suggest otherwise."}
{"text":"WARNING!! COCKROACH INFESTATION!!!!   STAY AWAY!!!  My friend and I went for dinner last night (September 22, 2016) and near the end of our dinner we found a tiny cockroach crawling around our plate. We immediately called the waitress   She took the plate to the back and came back saying \"my boss said he can make u a new one\". I told refused her offer and told her to tell her boss that we were not going to pay and that I would further notify the Health/Food Safety board. they still made us pay."}
{"text":"I have no idea why the ratings for Hana-Bi aren't higher. The owners of Hana-Bi used to own a place near where I lived but ever since they moved I've never found any good sushi near me, so now I always drive 30minutes just to go to Hana-Bi. The owners are the hardest working people I know and it shows in the quality of their food. The prices are average/reasonable and I always know I'm getting my money's worth. You should definitely check out Hana-Bi next time you're looking for good Japanese food."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years now. Always been ok with the food. The quality and quantity is always above average compared to most places in the area. Never had problems with their service and some days they will offer free complimentary apps which I did receive a few times."}
{"text":"For a salmon sushi lover, Hana-bi is a great place to come to because they have a special combo at $13.99 where you get salmon sashimi, salmon sushi, and salmon maki rolls. Yep... lots of salmon to satisfy your craving!!!  The portion is really good so you don't leave hungry.  On top of that, this combo meal comes with salad and miso soup.   Also the staff there are nice and attentive.  They always come to make sure the teapot isn't empty.  It really is a nice little place where you can sit down and unwind and to enjoy your meal."}
