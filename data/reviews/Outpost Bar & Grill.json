{"text":"Prototypical neighborhood joint that's clean (unlike so many others).  Earthy and comfortable with the services and drinks you'd expect.  Very friendly bartender, great jukebox, electronic darts, and video poker/slots.   We're coming back again soon!   I'm withholding the 5th star until I try the fish fry that everyone raves about."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I liked the grilled cheese. Its a decent size meal. Bartenders were okay. Good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Well executed fish fry.  Atmosphere is typical of a WI pub on a Friday night.  Decent salad bar (but undifferentiated).   Nice beer selection on tap.   Kid friendly.  Very attentive and energetic service.   Fish was very good and servings were plentiful.  Prices were reasonable.   Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar and grill.   Great staff.   Food was very good and the prices reasonable.   Good selection of beer on tap.   $8 pitchers.   Food is mostly burgers, but with a few other things as well.   Good onion rings. Liked the fries.

Go for a fun, low-scale experience.   If you want up-scale pretension try the place (1855) across the street.

Sports on the TV's almost all of the time."}
{"text":"We dropped in when our first choice had too long of a wait, but we'd wanted to try it, glad we did! It is a patriotic, comfy place. Very welcoming. AND the have yummy burgers & fries! Oh, and The Husband's Patty Melt was really good, too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good old neighborhood bar.  Just a nice place to enjoy a good burger or enjoy a great Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Outpost over many years and have never been disappointed.  Fish fry is the best-it's hard to do Catfish well and theirs is always excellent.  Great drinks and beers and the servers are sweet and attentive.  T shirts and shorts are welcome.  

Pricing is very reasonable, portions are great, they aren't trying to be a supper club but serve excellent bar food.  The best neighborhood bar around!"}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry is really good. You can get it ordered in  different size portions. From small to large. Small place so there is a wait normally 30 mins unless you are real early. Salad bar is only negative factor since it is nit stocked very often and stuff runs out. Would be nice is staff paid attention to that better. Burgers are good and soups and other sandwiches they offer."}
