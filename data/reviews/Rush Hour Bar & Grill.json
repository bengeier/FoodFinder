{"text":"Yee-Haaaw! If there was a low-end cowboy bar in Twinsburg - this would be it. Or, college bars gone dead and old. We came at 640pm...tables had food scraps or were sort of dirty. The waitress was about 6'2\" and could beat up any male biker. Sort of looked down on us non-laborer types and wasn't too friendly and accomodating. She remembered the order in her head but didn't write it down.  Our order came back all goofed up. We had the fish and chips, Lake Erie Perch. It was small in quantity. Overcooked/overfried. Ditto that for the chicken wings. The chicken parmesan was not too good either - my partner ordered that. If you eat here - stick to the burgers. Who can goof up a burger. Don't order other stuff.  We requested knives with the food. We had to ask twice to get them. They had to wash them before giving it to us. There were 10 people at the bar and restaurant and service was pretty lame.  We used a restaurant.com coupon and we were not presented an itemized bill. We were overcharged a few $$$ too.  In today's bad economy you'd think they'd try harder to grow their business.  Good-bye Grumpy Hour Bar and Grill!"}
{"text":"Although bartenders are slow they have good food. However ladies beware if visit alone, you may meet strange old men who wants to talk your ear off...."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, great drink and food specials and the food is tasty! I always stop in when I am in town and have not been let down yet. Nice patio as well."}
{"text":"Not a great place. Beers are crappy on tap unless you enjoy miller or bud.  Service is slow. Was there over 5 minutes and the place was dead. Finally went up to bar to get my own drink then my server approached me."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time 5-6 yrs ago.  They had great food and drink specials.  Not sure if there is new mgmt but food is not the same as it used to be...it's a shame bc it was my favorite place."}
{"text":"This place used to be fun. New ownership and all the good staff is gone = just another lame bar. Skip it."}
{"text":"Great food and FANTASTIC  service.. Thanks Sarah!  Perfect tasting drinks and the food was hot and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Rush Hour on a Saturday night for some live trivia, drinks, and some wings with 3 other friends and ended up having a pretty good time.  During the Cav's debacle RH offers 5 for $7 buckets of domestics and $0.35 regular and boneless wings.  We decided to put down about 8 buckets of beers 40 wings, 2 different flavors, spicy garlic and hot BBQ.  The wings, both boneless and regular, were cooked properly, lots of flavor and sauce, and really were quite delicious.   We weren't offered blue cheese, ranch, or celery which kind of irked me but the place was jam packed and I really didn't want to crowd the table anymore then the double fisting beers already were.    The overall service was slow as stated in the previous review but the amount of people definitely attributed.  Given that there is a Mavis Winkles and Paninis on each side of this bar, it really surprises me that a place like this can maintain its regular flow of drunks.  Although I can't complain about the prices nor can I about the food that we tried.  I can see myself coming back maybe during the summer but really not quite worth the 40 minute drive.  If you are local, give it a shot, its got the daily happy hour potential."}
