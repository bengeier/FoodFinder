{"text":"We had an event for about 100 people.  Waiter's Choice catered the spread and did a wonderful antipasto with delish prosciutto and cheeses and olives.  They also included filo dough cups filled with mini salads, chicken fingers and a spinach artichoke dip.  Everything I tasted was incredible.  They were prompt, professional and the food was to rave about!"}
{"text":"Waiter's Choice is the BEST for executive lunches! I ordered a large tray of sandwiches and sides from this company to provide lunch for about 35 people. The sandwiches were AMAZING...fresh with herbs sprinkled on top. The sides were also super delicious. This is an AFFORDABLE company with GREAT food options and a FANTASTIC staff. Thanks so much Waiter's Choice!"}

{"text":"For catering it doesn't get any better. Choices are great and the food is even better. I think they have the best BBQ in CLT. I've used them for work and for personal events. Super helpful and always professional."}
{"text":"WC catered our Thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob. We ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal. Everything tasted delicious. The turkey was not dry as it sometimes can be, and I was a big fan of their mashed-potatoes and tea (I mix sweet & unsweet together). High marks for a great job!"}
{"text":"I've used Waiter's Choice for dozens of catering jobs. Mostly corporate lunches at work for 10 to 120 people. I have used their white tablecloth formal setup as well as their express style service. Most recently they catered breakfast  2 days last week and lunch 3 days last week each for 20 people. each delivery was perfectly on time, and exactly what I ordered. They are always professional and the food is great. in the last week alone, I have eaten their fried chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage, egg and cheese croissant sandwiches, cookies, brownies and a variety of sides. Keep up the good work, we need more place like Waiter's Choice that understand how to manage good food and fantastic customer service at reasonable prices."}
