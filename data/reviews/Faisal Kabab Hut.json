{"text":"Great food we had biryanis and bean mash with bbq kebab platter extremely slow service expect to wait more than an hour to eat"}
{"text":"Best Pakistani Food in Calgary!!!

Chicken Biriyani is the best! $6.95 is good for 2.

Kababs are really good.

Too busy and customer service could be better; but remember its not fine dining; 

Really low prices and great portions.

Decor is dated

The taste is addictive despite of the poor service."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant no one was interested in seating us upon asking 1 person said there is No space come after a while. I went there as someone recommended me saying food is good but looking at the shabby and un hygienic decore also the hassle of finding parking I won't go again."}
{"text":"Hands down best food at this place best Chicken seekh kababs, there Daal is so damn good too."}
{"text":"We ordered food from this restaurant for two people and they told us to come in 30 min. We went there they asked us to wait more and we kept waiting for 40 mins. After 40 mins they came and asked us to reconfirm what we ordered. We were like ... Whaa ? It was already 1 hour and 10 min of wait and they still did not start cooking our order. We complained , they don't care, they didn't even feel sorry. Very bad attitude and very bad service. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Good food, not the cleanest restaurant, but for takeout this is the ultimate destination"}
{"text":"The d√©cor in the place could use a bit of change--from the old carpet over the creaking floorboards to the dim lighting, it does look like the building's seen better days.  Not the most important point, however I feel it bears saying.
I also have to say I did enjoy the food--if you're not the best with spicy foods though, do definitely ask your waiter, as the spiciness levels varied greatly between the dishes our group ordered (from mild to eye-watering!).

The quality wasn't too consistent, as some dishes were vastly weaker than others--I found the butter chicken was just decent, but meanwhile the salmon we ordered was spicy and absolutely delicious! :)  My Pakistani friend introduced me to this cuisine so I'm glad to have tried it here."}
{"text":"This is number one on my list when it comes to Pakistani/Indian food in Calgary. The BBQ platter, Butter Chicken, Mutton Biryani with a side of Naan is my go to combo every time and i have yet to be disappointed. They have second location i believe its called Fatima on Falconridge Blvd, both are 5 stars."}
{"text":"The location was very convenient and easy to get to. The atmosphere in the restaurant was lovely and authentic, with the nice seating option of either upstairs and downstairs. The service was also quick and efficient. 

However, when it comes to the food if you aren't spice proof, then be careful what you order. The menu does not specify the level of spice in each meal which makes it difficult for people that can't handle extreme spice. We ordered biryani chicken and samosa and while they were very tasty I couldn't enjoy it due to my eyes and nose watering.

The prices are very reasonable for the portion size."}
{"text":"Food is always good at this place however when it come to service, they are well below par!! The lady who is probaly the owner will never accept her fault. Just listen to the customer once and your business will definitely get more better reviews."}
{"text":"They have good seating arrangment for families, food is generally good with better service than other Pakistani/Indian resturants. Only thing is that they dont know the difference between Nann and tandori roti. They are selling tandori roti in the name of Nann and for Naan price. If you want fresh real Pakistani style naans then go to Chatkhara resturant"}
{"text":"Faisal is perhaps the best Pakistani / \"Muslim\" restaurant in Calgary.  Their \"BBQ\" grilled meat platter is very popular.  All of their curries and Karahis are excellent.  While vegetarian options are limited, they are good.  Best Naan in Calgary.  And their lunch specials for under $10 provides enough food to easily feed two people. 

This restaurant serves excellent authentic tastes of Pakistani food at a great value.  Pakistani/Indian food is meant to be eaten as a shared meal.  Go as a group, order different items and share!  Expect no more than $15 per person even if you go all out."}
{"text":"So first let me start off by saying I've never had Pakistani food before. My rating won't be based on authenticity. Some Indian friends of ours took us here and because they have the best beef haleem. However, it seems like everyone else in town knows this as they always run out. You may have to go at lunch time to get the opportunity to eat one.

We had the chickpea chana curry, the beef nihari, and the Afghani kebab. This is how good it is: my husband is American and always throws away food instead of taking leftovers, and he ate everything.  He wasn't even hungry! That beef nihari is slowly cooked over 14 hours, and is just so tender and flavorful. The chana had more kick, but the yogurt on the side can help calm things down if it gets too intense. The Afghani kebabs are marinated in dairy, and it does taste a little different from other kebabs (but still delicious). It was so f*cking good. 

The space just looks ok, but you're here for the food so who cares?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Very friendly staff. They served us free salad while we waited for the food.
We drove far from where we live to try it out after a co-worker recommended this place.
We are kind of addicted to Indian/ Pakistani food. Not from that culture at all, so we are still experimenting lots, get suggestions from friends who are from both countries to eat the 'real thing'.
This place is not fancy -but the food is really good.
We had  2 Seekh Kebab ( Beef and Chicken) and Butter Chicken. Very delectable and everything was fresh - made to order. The Garlic Naan bread was yummy. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere - Probably the best Seekh Kababs in Calgary (maybe second to Mirchi), it has a very similar taste to the Kababs they serve at Mirchi (across from Safeway on 12th ave in Downtown).

We go there at least once a month just for the seekh kababs however, their tandoori fish and chicken karahi is also great.  The yogurt sauce is heaven when you have it with the kababs - i also noticed that the cucumbers in their salad does not stink just like in some other restaurants.

If you haven't been to Kabab Hut you must at least once for their delicious seekh kabab - Trust me you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Recommend by friend who speak so highly about this place.

We all loved the food. 
Quality, Quantity and taste were perfect.
Above all despite of being so busy our waiter did amazing service going up and down getting our food to us."}
{"text":"This has always been one of our favourite restaurants in Calgary... Recently we tried bbq platter and chicken biryani and as usual they were great in taste..."}
{"text":"This is in the desi block of town. Don't go for the ambience or service but for the taste of the food. The prices are very very reasonable. The Nan's are tasty and soft for $.99. Just go for the plain nan instead of the garlic naan as there is no difference other than the $1. The Maas daal is delicious. The chicken seekh kabab is a must try among the appetizers. The ginger chicken is tasty and boneless. The palak paneer was ok. All the dishes are $7.95 for vegetarian and $9.95 for chicken. Overall worth a try without dropping a significant weight off your wallet however I can't say the same about your tummy!"}
{"text":"I booked the table at 2:30PM on 9jun for dinner and open my fast with family, we showed up 20min prior to time and guy at the reception turned us back saying sorry, we are all booked. Then he said I tried calling you 30min ago to say we got all booked which we never received any call. This was ver unethical and against the business practice. I would never go to this restaurant and let my contacts know. I got really upset because we booked in afternoon for dinner but they overbooked someone else and said sorry now I cannot do anything. Worst customer service, no ethics, I must go public on their business practice."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but has deteriorated recently. The interior was never a strong point, however there is a big decline in food quality on my recent visit. Not impressed by food at all, the taste was bad and appeared reheated many times. Please do not order gulab jaman, they are harder than snooker balls. Not recommended. Big deterioration. Is there a management change?"}
{"text":"It is easily the best pakistani food I have had in North America and I have had a lot of it. They have the best haleem and kababs. Their samosa is great too. I am not a big fan of their biriyani (I am a biriyani snob) and yet every time I am there, I come out happy and content."}
{"text":"Best Pakistani food in Calgary for sure. The place is very, very busy but the service is usually very fast. 

Their food is inexpensive and amazing. Try the Beef Nihari and of course the Beef Seekh Kebabs. Also the Fish Tandoori is awesome. And the Naans are the best in the city."}
{"text":"The food is authentic & delicious. Customer service is above average, but most importantly, you get the best bang for your buck!  Portions are plenty for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Authentic!!! 
Best seekh kabab and tikka in Alberta. Those who have given this place lower than 4 stars had perhaps ignored the price point. Best value for money :)"}
{"text":"Best shish kebab in Calgary. It's a bit of a dive, but a comfortable dive. But besides the decor, I have no complaints because it's clean and it has charm and character, the food is amazing here. Not to mention the staff is accommodating, kind and tries to make you comfortable.

Next time I'm definitely ordering their fish tandoori Tikka. I saw it come out for someone else on the sizzling hot plate - heaping tandoori fish, everything looked and tasted fresh, spices to perfection. Completely delicious. 

The lunch special is totally worth it in my opinion. You get a choice of eight great dishes, it was so hard for me to decide. I chose shish kebab. I got two large tender very flavorful sizzling shish kebabs on a hot plate over onions and a slice of lemon. And then fresh really delicious saffron rice, fresh butter naan-that melted in my mouth, A cold soda in a can, yogurt dressing for the meat and rice and a little side salad for something like $9.50!

This is my new favourite Pakistani restaurant. I came here once last year and also had a great food experience and some of my friends came a couple years ago and I've heard nothing but good things. I think this is a hidden gem. If you're in the area try it out. If you're not in the area go there. I went on a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant had one table left open."}
