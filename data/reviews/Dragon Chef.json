{"text":"We ordered 4 small trays for a party of 2 pork trays, 1 beef, and 1 chow mein, but when we served the food we noticed that it was all vegetables with hardly any pork, beef, shrimp etc.  So we pretty much paid $150 for green pepper, onion and other vegetables mixed in sauce.  We will NEVER order from here again, they rip you off big time."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for take out. It is a typical Chinese Fast Food joint.
So you can expect plenty of deep fried goodness and grease. Otherwise you are in the wrong place.

I usually go for their set combos which are a great value as they pack the combos with a ton of food. I have also tried their Cantonese fried noodles and pad thai, it is passable; as I mentioned before; this is not a 5 star restaurant. It is a fast food joint.
But the food is rather decent and well priced.

It fits the bill for me whenever I am in the mood for some General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, egg roll and chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Hi All,

I had an egg roll to start off with and basically it was a deep fried shell with grease inside...tossed it away immediately- AWFUL!.   Also had Mei Fun which was average, but not too bad.  In addition, I tried the Szechuan shrimp- also average.  

Since I am visiting the area for work, I would not return here so I can do more yelping...but if this is the only Chinese place in the area and if i had a deep need for Chinese food, this place would work.  

Would have given it three stars...but that egg roll was incomprehensibly bad.  The other food- shrimp and chicken was decent quality.     

Service was friendly.  There is a sit down area of about 6 tables, however this place is mostly designed for take out.  And they do not accept American Express, but Visa worked.

Unknown if they do delivery.
