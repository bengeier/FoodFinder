{"text":"My family went there to celebrate a birthday party and I have to say that the service and food was great.  The staff was attentive and the food was good.  Everything we ordered we received in a timely manner.  We were quite impressed.  We thought the prices were on par with other AYCE restaurants but there was definitely more variety.  Great spider roll and the sashimi was fresh.  The cooked food was good too.  We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying that I am not the most adventurous sushi connoisseur. I am fab if they have spicy salmon, dynamite rolls, dragon rolls and tempura on the menu. If you can't find these on the menu, you probably aren't at a sushi joint. Hint: Is there the golden arches in the restaurant?  I found it odd that the dinner menu started at 3:30, but to each his (or her) own. As a result, it was a tad expensive for my starving student's taste buds.   Everything was delish, and freshly prepared. (trust, I gave those chefs a staredown while I salivated over the thought of my dynamite rolls)   Staff could have been more attentive.  Also what up with the decor? I understand sushi restaurants can read tacky, but tinsel and Christmas bows? cutee... Then again, as long as the food was coming in, my attention was more on my chopsticks and battling my friends for that last piece of sushi."}
{"text":"Probably not a good idea to go to an AYCE on a low carb diet :) But at least you're allowed to order 15 pieces of salmon sashimi here during the lunch AYCE! Restaurant was empty, service was awesome. I love that its just tiny pieces of blank paper that you write down your order numbers in - way to cut costs! :)  The food that came was okay, I mean not that great, not bad. The portion of edamame was quite large, which was good for me :) Otherwise nothing really stood out here except a pretty cheap AYCE meal. I'd come back if someone had a huge appetite at lunch."}
{"text":"I went back to this place about a month ago and I have no idea what happened to it. The quality of the fish they used that day we went was absolutely horrendous. I've never ordered much other than sushi at an all you can eat Japanese restaurant but that time I couldn't bear to eat any of their fish after the second round or so. I hope it was just a one off, but it honestly put me off to have had such a bad experience, even if it was only once. So even if they're not consistently bad, they've at the very least become hit and miss."}
{"text":"For an All You Can Eat restaurant, this place is decent.   The salmon sashimi is always fresh, but the other types of sashimi seems to be defrosted the day of. I wouldn't suggest any of the hot food, but why would you order hot food at a sushi place anyways? I love the Snow Roll and Torch Roll - I think they just came out with specialty rolls, and I\"m glad the price hasn't gone up.   The quality and service is not as top notch as places like Nami and Take Sushi or Yuzu, but you get what you pay for. If you pay by cash, they give you an automatic 10% off your bill! (Note: The tips are already included in the final bill, so don't make the mistake of tipping extra on top of that, unless your server was awesome)  I'm a regular here only because I live so close to it, and of course because I'm a huge fan of Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"First and last time I ever go to this dated all you can eat sushi place. Besides being mediocre food ( across the street Ginza Sushi is 100 times better) what really upset me was the state of their washrooms. Totally disgusting and I made the employee clean it right away. I will never go back and you have been warned."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we could've served ourselves. Our order of salmon sashimi didn't taste too fresh and actually still had bone in it. Tuna sashimi was frozen. The sushi was nothing to write home about and the crab sticks tasted old and dry. There were orders that never showed up and we were given things we didn't even order. There were 4 tables there including ours!!    Not to mention the eardrum killing music selection they had blasting the entire time. One song will be country and the next was rap.   Their motto is \"if all else fails, ADD MAYONNAISE!\""}
{"text":"Another cheap sushi restaurant. I order a 18 pcs of sashimi and the fish was a size of my baby finger. The salmon was a little fair. I order a large sake and told the server make sure it's really hot. It came out warm."}
{"text":"Wow this place has excellent sushi. How is this only 3 stars average? This is definitely a 4 star worthy place. Sushi on the flavor level was extremely good, and this applies to basically everything we ordered. You can also judge a sushi restaurant based on the quality of the ginger, and this place has the chops.  The only reason I'm docking a star is that the service is mediocre at best as there were only 3 other parties in there and many times we could not find our waitress. Also the salmon sashimi pieces were quite small, but hey its all you can eat."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi spot I actually like as they have cooked sushi options as well (not into raw anything). I like the Fried Red Snapper roll and the teriyaki chicken is good as well.   This place is all you can eat and they have many regular cooked food items as well which makes it all the better for someone who does not like raw sushi or sashimi (all the women in my life love sushi (mom, fianc√©e, cousins, friends).   I compare every other sushi place I go to to this one and I prefer sushi fun.   As other reviewers have stated they do VERY often forget to bring you dishes you ordered which kept me from giving them the four stars I initially clicked on.  This will continue to be my fav sushi spot until I find somewhere else with as much cooked sushi options  Note: I was told by owner of another sushi spot to never order rice just an fyi"}
{"text":"I ordered their food for delivery. The food only took 30 minutes to get to my house which was good but I opened the food to find an unpleasant surprise. The miso soup is oily enough to be used as gasoline and the noodles were cooked with the promise of 100% no taste. I also got the dynamite roll which did not have the ingredients to be called a dynamite roll. The chicken that I got was 95%bones and 3%fat. The 2% of chicken that I did get was dry and flavourless. Above all else, it was extremely expensive"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical coming to place at first. Sure, its in the same plaza as my all time fav middle eastern restaurant, but it was right on top of The Sports Nut bar (which is one of the sketchiest places i've ever been too...yet i've been there at least 20 times).  So I was ready to take this on with a grain of salt. But boy, was it great!  I really enjoyed the food here. They had a really great variety. The service was actually  pretty good too (We were there around 4pm on a Saturday, so it was empty. Maybe thats why we got the amazing service). We got to sit in the booth, which was awesome.   They had some really great different rolls from other places, and so many different types of Shrimp!  The Crispy Shrimp was my fav. Deep fried shrimp, served with spicy mayo. Not actually crispy, but it was delicious. I wasn't a fan of their tempura, but the other food greatly made up for it.   But my favourite part was desert. Most AYCE Sushi places dont have great deserts, just your standard fare of Green Tea/ Red Been/ Chocolate / Vanilla Ice Cream, which they had, in addition to Deep Fried Ice Cream, and Deep Fried Bananas served with chocolate sauce. It was awesome.  I'd definitely come here again. And its great in terms of public transit too, right off the Clarke Viva Station :)"}
{"text":"Have driven past the plaza this reataurant is in so many times, but never noticed it.   Anyway, The food quality is good, and the servers are helpful.  I ordered their fifty pcs tray for takeout. The tray included twenty pieces of sushi and thirty pieces maki sushi.  All items were freshly prepared. The price was reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great Service (Friendly, Attentive)... Amazing Buffet (Selection, Quality and Quantity) Good Location (Parking, Spacious Restaurant with Plenty of Seating) Lunch $12.95 11am-4 ... Dinner $19.95 4-11pm One of my Fav's now when I'm in the area :D"}
{"text":"Decent AYCE restaurant. Booths are nice, Japanese style. The place is decorated very nicely. Lots of light, bright colours. Mainly red.   Menus are nice, everything you order - you can write down yourself. By the number and the amount of the item.   Service seemed very quick. There are a lot of things on the menu and the food was very fresh.   Servers forgot a few things here and there...  All and all.. A decent restaurant.   3/5  Note: bottomless drinks are not included. 10% with cash. 10% mandatory service fee."}
{"text":"I have to bid farewell to this AYCE. My fiancee and I went there last night and were disappointed with the overall quality and service. Normally, I would order the soup/salad/ and a few appetizers first as they are put under the APPETIZER category... but I was surprised that I had to ask 3 times if the soup and salad we're coming half way thru our meal, our waitress just snarled and said its being made.. I didn't know they made seaweed salad from scratch lol.   The portions of the sashimi were the size of my pinky nail and got smaller the second time around. I left the restaurant feeling a little groggy and unhappy.   I'll stick to my other AYCE... Sorry Sushi Fun you're cut"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and they have been keeping up their standards on every one of my visits. I have had great sushi and this place would not come close but the food is definitely worth the price. The service was not really bad either."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sushi-type buffet, I recommend this place.  Their lunch and dinner menu are great -- they have different types of sushi and an assortment of different types of sushi rolls.    Prices are reasonable but I do think they should offer a lower rate or even free for kids under 3.   The only thing is that the decor of the restaurant is a bit-dated and old -- I think the restaurant has gone thru a few ownership changes.   They've pretty much focused on the food and service."}
{"text":"4/5 - Food 4/5 - Service Great for a quick all you can eat. I received good service. Gratuities are included in your bill."}
