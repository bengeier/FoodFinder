{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner with two friends. Each of us ordered something from different sections of the menu and were all very happy with our selections. The decor is attractive, the waitstaff attentive and the food delicious. More than enough food to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in service and food was mediocre at best. We ordered General Tso Chicken and Sesame Chicken. One of the entrees were cold.   The fried rice was very bland and tasted like it was not fresh.   We will not go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Very fresh sushi and incredible rolls!  Beautiful dining area and bar.  Such a treat and I'm from California where the sushi is hard to beat!  You will love their menu!  Some of the dishes are fried so just be sure to ask if you don't like fried food ( which I don't).  You will not regret dining here and the service is great too."}
{"text":"Use to come here when it was Sakura they have made excellent changes to the menu and the decor of the place looks completely new. The food was ok not a fan of the sauce they give you with the fried wantons or their shrimp sauce. But rice and fried wantons was good and so was the shrimp tempura roll. Overall the service was great and food was decent."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and have had mostly good experiences. The staff are very friendly, good service, good quality food, and it is served quickly. We had some service issues with staff one time, but when we expressed our issues, they resolved them immediately. Place is rarely packed and we have been seated ASAP everytime we go. There are very similar restaurants close by (Cherry up 49, RB in Tega Cay, & Fuji up in Steele Creek) and they also do a great job--it will be interesting to see if all 3 can make it! Check them OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, nice decor. Lunch time was not busy, food came quickly and was well presented nicely.   Probably a good spot for dinner and is a good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, service and value.  Decor is nice and quaint.  Very pleased with Shia.  Will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"We are delighted to have Shia in our community. I have eaten at several establishments in Lake Wylie and this place is by far the best for food quality as well as a most friendly staff. Keep up the good work and you will have yourself a loyal customer in me."}
{"text":"Nihao.......This restaurant was fantastic.   Just go.... The presentation was amazing.  The taste exceptional. The staff, fun....... The restaurant looks very basic from the outside, in fact many people would just drive by....but....once you get inside...Sushi bar, granite tables, full menu, fresh food.. .Most importantly, the food is prepared fresh.  Just try it...."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best but the service was good.  Waitresses were friendly and attentive. We ordered the steak soup and udon and both dishes missed the mark. The flavors did not merry not well, tasted more like instant noodles which is fine but not what we paid for."}
{"text":"Went to Shia Bistro tonight and the experience was amazing.  Our waitress was Ashley and she was very helpful and very pleasant.  We started the night with their Crab Raggons, a glass of Sangria and their house red wine, the drinks were perfectly made and the appetizer was scrumptious, we followed with two of their rolls, Boston Roll and the tempura shrimp rolls, they we're also delicious and very savory. For the main dinner they made to order their Teppan-Taki but with all three steak, shrimp & Chicken.  I would recommend this place to everyone, the whole night was perfect, nice ambiance, great food and wonderful service.  Go! You will love the place.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem! I recently moved to the Lake Wyle area and have been searching for a good sushi place. The reviews are all true! Delicious, fresh food with a clean and quaint atmosphere. I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and is out fairy quick. The staff is very nice. The is a bit pricey for what you get. We have been there twice and the entire family enjoyed it both times."}
{"text":"We were a regular customer at another sushi restaurant and they refused me a reservation one Friday evening, so we decided to visit Shia and we are so glad we did.The decor is fresh and clean and the service is excellent, especially if Nina waits on you and the Sashimi deserves 5 stars for sure.  We love sashimi and I believe that it is the true measurement of any fine sushi restaurant for raw fish is either fresh and good or not.  Shia has started some new features and you need to check them out.  They have just started an excellent variety of desserts and they are creating sushi rolls that are true specials, like today's Dancing in the Sea roll and the Lake Wylie Valley roll. Both are very good.  We always have a sashimi appetizer and a couple of the fresh, made as you wait, sushi rolls, along with excellent service  and an adult beverage of too !!"}
{"text":"I love going to Shia, the food is always delicious, the atmosphere is relaxing, the staff is very friendly and the prices are good.  I love getting a pot of their hot tea with my meal.  We have been many times and it's always been consistently good!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, shrimp, and wine. Can't go wrong with anything here. This is our favorite restaurant and the staff is the best!  They have live acoustic music occasionally.  The Four Season Roll is my favorite selection and if you're here for lunch, get the Lunch Box special. The Lo Mein is great.  Tip: if your table is having 4 pours, it's better to get a bottle. ;)"}
{"text":"Updated review....  This place switched owners and let me tell you..you def can tell. I went there a couple of weeks ago and I ordered the rainbow roll...I took a bite..it still had clear plastic wrap on the outside of the roll. Completely grossed me out. They did not charge me that is a plus. But the food is not the same...we ordered a few different things. The service is horrible and I get that they are taking over. But this place will never be the same...I miss the family atmosphere when you walked in greater with a smile and seeing Shia behind the counter. It's not the same. You will be missed.       This place is by far the best restaurant in lake Wylie if not York county as a whole. The staff is always polite and attentive.. It's family owned and simply comforting..I always feel welcomed when I come to eat. The place is beautiful and very clean. Family friendly as well, which is a plus for me. The sushi is amazing, I would recommend every roll, I have tried them all and I have never been disappointed. I always go here with my family and my kids love it, I love it. Their peach tea is on point. If you're in the area, you must stop in."}
{"text":"What an unexpected And very pleasant surprise. It is a small restaurant, but a gem. We were a party of 5 adults and a toddler, which can be a challenge under any circumstances, but we were early, 6:00 O'clock, and seated immediately. Our waitress, Elizabeth, was very attentive and conscientious about ensuring she brought my son both his food and drink as soon as possible, helping to prevent hungry child meltdown.  Two large parties arrived in quick succession and everyone seemed to order sushi. Elizabeth came and explained that there were only two Chefs and apologized for the somewhat longer wait time, which we also appreciated. She ensured we were kept stocked on drinks and kept bringing my son refills on his rice bowl.  When the sushi arrived it was not only a lovely display but the fish was superb. Order the one hot kiss, it is a fabulous chopped scallop appetizer. We did a sushi sashimi meal, a number of rolls and nigiri. We were stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"So I went back, and LOVED it all over again. Ms. Jean remembered me, so she has that touch with her customers, awesome! The sushi was again ridiculously good, and the fried rice, noodles, and shrimp were DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We chose to grab an after church lunch at Shia today and it was once again a great meal.  I had the sesame chicken jewel box that comes with the entree,  fried or white rice, your choice of a sushi roll (from a select list) and sweet carrots. I chose the Philly Roll and fried rice, but also added an egg roll because I was in the mood for one. Shia has my favorite sesame chicken by FAR in the Lake Wylie area. The egg roll was good and pretty nicely sized for the $1.75 up charge.   Hubby got pork fried rice and said it was good, but he would have loved some duck sauce to accompany it.   There seemed to be just the one owner/waitress today so she was hustling to get everyone served and glasses filled, but other than a couple of minor waits for chopsticks and water, no complaints from us.   We used a 10% off Yelp check in to save a couple of bucks and we ate for just under $16 today."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. The sushi is fresh and well prepared. The Teppan Taki dishes have large portions, enough to share."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Charlotte! Great service! They are so friendly and prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"I must update my review bc of new owners, new chef & new staff. This occurred approximately one month ago & this was my first time there in 2 months. The place looks the same & the menu is mostly the same. The food is just \"OK\" but the service was horrid.  We were a grp of 5, ordered calamari & a sushi roll for appetizers. One in our party ordered miso soup with plain fried rice as a main course & told our waiter this is what she intended. After a long wait, a table of 4 next to us who arrived later than us & placed their order after us but got all their food BEFORE us, I asked our waiter where our appetizers were. He said he'd check & then shortly came out with the sushi, calamari & a bowl of miso. Before we finished the appetizers, he then brought out 3 of our party's main dishes. We then had to ask him twice about the fried rice that was supposed to go with the main dishes. He finally brought out 2 bowls of fried rice & said more was coming. By now, my wife's main dish was cold & she still hadn't gotten her fried rice. I had to inquire twice more about the rice when another server told us they had run out & was making more. When they finally brought out the 3 other bowls of fried rice, the food was cold. When we pointed this out, they had to take the food back to the kitchen & reheated it. This reheating rendered two of the dishes dry and didn't taste very good.  They did try to make things right & gave us 10% off the bill. But none of us felt it made up for the frustration we had to deal with.  I think part of the problem here is a language barrier as all the servers struggled with their English. I'm a first-gen Chinese immigrant but learned English at the age of 4 so was able to communicate with them in Chinese to a certain degree. I find it inexcusable that I had to speak to them in Chinese to get them to understand what we wanted. I'm sure very, very few other customers have this ability so their experiences might actually be worse.  Given that the entire crew at this place is new, I'm sure there will be growing pains. But we're not going back until things get better sorted out."}
{"text":"Came in here to get some sushi but ended up getting their piping hot speciality, the Teppan-Taka Seafood. Excellent dish to split with someone. The sauce was really good and there was a nice variety of seafood. The staff was excellent and the place was clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went on Christmas Eve w my family.  Did not arrive until almost 9 and there was a line...the staff continuously updated us on timing and made our wait tolerable.  Once seated, our waitress was delightful, fast and accomodating.  Our food was super fresh and the three crown broccoli is amazing.  Hidden treasure in Lake Wylie!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great lunch box specials every day. if you're in the Steele Creek area of Charlotte, cross the border and come to this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is excellent! Sushi fresh - love! The Tom Tom soup is a must for shrimp lovers-- shrimp on a spicy red seafood broth and mushrooms-- mm Best tofu-- it is not mushy nice stir fry. The Seafood Teppan-Taki dish- excellent but my fave Royal Crisp Duo--shrimp,scallops with broccoli in a chili sauce -- kind of like a little heavier tempur batter"}
{"text":"We love this place - the food and presentation is GREAT!! And the staff are all so much more friendly than  the other Asian food option in Lake Wylie . Wether you are interested in appetizers, sushi or something from the kitchen. You will always get the freshest ingredients and awesome service!  And the prices are VERY reasonable.   Well will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is upscale with a treat for your palate. Wine was great, drink and food specials...all upscale. Sushi is delicious and you'll find new things that will delight you. They offer kids meals and dinners are enough to split. Service is better than average, is a family owned business so I enjoy supporting it.  I think you'll like it if you try it!"}
{"text":"Shia continues the phenomenon of quality affordable Asian food in this area of SC/NC.  There are very limited choices when it comes to finding good dining options in the Gaston County/Lake Wylie area except for Americanized Asian quality meals.  The outside is unassuming but inside is modern and inviting.  The variety and quality of the menu, from sushi to almost all of the Asian cuisines is reason to stop and come back."}
{"text":"Regularly visit here for a dose of sushi lovely people working here try so hard to meet every need. Highly recommended you should stop by. Oh and Sunday bring your own booze they don't have a license"}
{"text":"After reading some good reviews from fellow Yelpers, the hubs and I decided to give this place a try.  It's amazing to me how many fairly decent sushi restaurants you find within a 5-mile radius in this neck of the woods, when it's slim pickings on so many other types of restaurants.  You immediately can tell before you even go in that Shia has made mad improvements to the space.  Years ago, we walked out of a scary Asian place that used to be in this spot.  Of course, the whole \"Asian fusion\" (Carolinas?) thing is still going on with a sushi chef alongside a kitchen pumping out a bunch of Chinese, Japanese and Thai standards.  We stuck with sushi, and were pretty pleased.  The place was pretty dead, but it appeared everyone got fairly decent service.  The only flub-up for us was that the bar had not chilled the sparkling sake (sounded interesting) we saw on the menu, so we went with warm sake.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"I am pretty much a sushi snob and this place has some great sushi!! I ordered a few rolls (Alaskan and Dynamite) and you can taste just how fresh the fish is! I'm probably going to order a few more rolls even though I'm stuffed because it is just that good!  The waitress was extremely friendly and happy to make recommendations since I had never been before.  I have my new sushi place in SC/Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh blown away. What a jewel of a place...can't name the dishes we ordered, but the reviews are spot on. You can't go wrong with any items on the menu. I was a bit turned off by the slow service, but analyzing our server, I realized he was working alone until 3 other servers came on shift to get ready for the dinner rush on a Friday. They were a bit slow at first, but the customer service and great attitude was clearly visible. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok folks sorry to say but here we go again! This place Sucked! What is the meat in the chicken lettuce wraps? I've been a chef for a long time and never seen anything like that . This is not a Japanese sushi restaurant this is a Korean restaurant which is not a bad thing but it's definitely not a place you want to go for sushi as far as I'm concerned if you want the real deal."}
{"text":"I'm not a ALL sure why this place gets so many good reviews. The food is very unimpressive, dry and overpriced. I'm not even particularly picky, but I KNOW excellent Asian food when I eat it and THIS....ain't it."}
{"text":"Food is really good especially for the price and the unexpected location. Chicken lettuce wraps are great. Sushi was surprisingly good as well. Nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here a while back, and it was superb.  The sushi was amazing, top 5 experiences ive ever had with one of my favorite food types.  Sadly I live 1hr away, so I rarely get to go. But i found myself down in Lake Wylie for work stuff and when lunch came around there was only one place to go.  Amazing service. Amazing food. Superb interior decor.   Go here and be happy."}
{"text":"A diamond in the ruff. Fresh and wonderful food. Shia has wonderful artistry. They have uni often. EVERYTHING is FRESH. Amazing find. Jean and the staff are amazing. Absolutely love this place. I dare say the best sushi in the Charlotte Metro region, handsdown"}
{"text":"Adorable wait staff. Delicious sushi. Prices were reasonable. Will defiantly be back! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered at at the other places in Lake Wylie and was either floored by the price or disappointed with the good. Tried Shia and was impressed with the quality of the food, service and price. Best in town by far!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited the restaurant since it opened  and I was amazed at the transformation that had taken place from the previous restaurant.  The restaurant was beautifully decorated and the food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  This restaurant is definitely worth checking out, it is certainly one of the best restaurants in the Lake Wylie area."}
{"text":"Omg best Chinese around. Ruins it for all the rest! Get the shrimp in garlic sauce it is perfect. Nice and clean. Wonton soup is excellent too."}
{"text":"Very near to lake Wylie marina , so makes a good place for dinner after whole day in nature . Everything we ordered was delicious . Nice portions , cutlery and garnishing. Loves wavy white plates. Soups taste good . Variety of options available . Quick service . Have sizelers . Variety of noodles and fried rice . I loved the mango ice tea ."}
{"text":"My number one pick to eat in Lake Wylie. Great sushi! Always fresh. The staff is friendly and attentive. Some days can be a bit of a wait, but totally worth it. If you're not looking for sushi, I suggest the teppan taki or lo mein."}
{"text":"Delicious! Is all I can say! I came in expecting to get a volcano roll but didn't see one on the menu. Which is totally fine. Makes me try new things. So, I tried the pink dragon roll and the Boston roll. Both were delicious! I figured the Boston roll would be smaller since it wasn't a speciality. I was wrong, the roll is huge and delicious. The pink dragon roll was delicious and huge as well. Service was great."}
{"text":"RIP Shia. I will miss you. The place is under new ownership and name change to Rainbow I think. Which is kind of funny since there use to be a different *ahem* establishment in our area called Rainbow.   Anyway, the service - although pleasant - was terrible. We were the only in house diners, 5 in our party. After 10+ minutes, we had to flag down our server just to get water/sodas.   The food came out in stages and very disorganized. They forgot to bring out some of it as well.   To top it off, the owners have at least 3 young kids running around the place like banshees. The youngest - 2 maybe, was walking around barefoot. The older boy of 7 or so would take knives out of their service area running around with them chasing his older sister and then.... PUT THEM BACK in the service area!  Worst of all, stomachs were greatly affected by the food - I'm guessing unsanitary conditions.   This place will not survive nor will we return."}
{"text":"Wife and I were looking for a good Sushi place in Lake Wylie. We stopped in here and were very pleasantly surprised. The staff was super friendly.  The sushi was good and very fast to the table. The atmosphere was pretty good also. A good place to bring your wife for a casual, sit down dinner."}
