{"text":"Very disappointed. Used to go quite often, but probably never again due to having my last two orders messed up.  Since they hired the new cook everything has gone downhill. I wouldn't be so upset if the orders weren't messed up due to failure to even look at the receipt properly. It's pretty sad that when you order a damn cheeseburger the cook doesn't even put the bloody cheese on it."}
{"text":"I'm always amazed when a good business decides to treat regular customers poorly for no apparent reason.  I ordered a big breakfast combo, which includes a beverage.  I decided on tea.  The cashier charged me an extra  $1.20, so I asked why.  Turns out a drink is extra after 11am.  Fine, but no mention of that on the menu beside the price.  I asked the cook about it who has definitely come to know us in the last few years.   \"Yup, it's extra.  Just don't charge him for the tea today but next time it's extra.  The boss sez.\"  We have been going there about every few weeks for the last 4 years.  Our bill for my wife and I was going to approach $40 for a diner style breakfast.   I hate being nickeled and dimed.   If that is what a business wishes to do, fine.  But post your real prices in plain view and let me make a decision, like walking out, which is what we did.    Double check your receipt.....  this is really quite a deceptive practice for a restaurant.   Sad."}
{"text":"A pal from work eats here often and she wanted me to try it out after work. We decided to have a late lunch/early dinner on Friday. It's hidden in the mall right at the south-east corner of Lawrence and Keele. There's a huge parking lot on site, but let me warn you - it's a very crowded one. The Flame is a very unassuming mom & pop restaurant. I had to do a double-take before seeing it. When I first walked in, I felt like I was back in the 80's. The decor is a little outdated with the clientele being a little rough around the edges; however, the food was very tasty (and reasonable). I had the cheeseburger with fries - the portion was generous. The fries were good, but the cheeseburger was delicious. Their burgers are homemade and very fresh with a mix of a few meats.   N.B. - Cash and Visa only.  Good for: burgers, all day breakfast"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style in front, table service in the back half. Pork souvlaki dinner is my go to. Meat quantity going down while price has gone up. Needs a restaurant make over."}
{"text":"Our family went here for lunch great home cooked food. Their burger combo with a side and a pop was under $10 we had 3 cheese burgers with salad with house dressing and a order if onion rings to share and my other daughter had their spaghetti with garlic bread and we added a pop for her.  It all came to about $55 for 4 people and we were full.  Generous portions.  Doesn't look like much but it's clean it's set up cafeteria style and there is a bar at the back.  Bathrooms are downstairs except one disabled one upstairs.   Staff were very nice"}
{"text":"Great burgers, souvlaki and breakfast. They close fairly early tho from what I remember"}
{"text":"Cashier refused back bacon on bun order then tried to refuse burger order as well, claiming cook was \"busy.\" If she cannot handle orders at breakfast, how dare they try to call this a restaurant now? With this change in staff and service, we won't be back. My daughter has egg allergy and refusing her back bacon order was unreasonable."}
