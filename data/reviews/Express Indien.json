{"text":"As an Indian living in NDG my choices were limited to the ones on sherbrooke street. Express Indien was a bit of a surprise. When I first went there I had the Biryani which was aweful. I didn't go back for a year. Then a friend dragged me there and I had the Thali lunch (mixed meal) which was priced at $10 and wow ! the saag was good as was the butter chicken. The Naan was one of the best I have had in town. The chef worked in some known restos in India so he knows what he's doing.He uses a real tandoor oven so you get that light texture and smoky taste. For ten bucks ! a really good meal that beats the Mc fast meals any day and much healthier ( he doesn't over do the grease). Not too spicy either. 
Decor is simple and clean. Just a  good meal at a good price. Nothing to write home about but it works for me."}
{"text":"Alright food; unremarkable place.

We had vegetarian samosas, butter chicken, and shahi paneer. The samosas were just filled with potatoes; well-seasoned and nice pastry, but kinda boring. The shahi paneer had a nice bit of heat and the cheese was good but the overall flavor was forgettable. The butter chicken was very tasty though!

The place itself looks pretty dated and if I hadn't read positive reviews beforehand I think I would have skipped. We weren't given any condiments until we were almost done with appetizers; skimped on the papadums; owner's family walking around quite a bit...

Overall not a bad meal and I wouldn't mind going there again but we will explore alternatives..."}
{"text":"On a personal note this place is a great neighborhood restaurant.  From the owners to the employees all respectful and admirable.  Food is without a doubt all awesomeness, always on the money same taste and flavor at all times.  Always a pleasure buying from Xpress Indien. 

Multiple thumbs up.

Keep up the good job in keeping us and our tummy happy"}
{"text":"Nice place, great prices. Meat was really dry unfortunately but the rest was pretty good! 

Give it a go"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to. that's saying a lot in a city with so many of them. The prices are unbeatable and if there is anything not on the menu they will make it for you."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the quality of the food and the tastiness of the sauces. I had the daily meal (Tahli) with chicken. You have a choice of lamb or vegetarian. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Back on top!! We've fallen in love with this place again, our previous experience must've been an anomaly and Ram the owner has assured us their attention to detail is still there. And it shows: the food is terrific. We are back with a vengeance and are so thankful to be so!"}
{"text":"Well prepared food in an unpretentious setting. I could see myself eating butter chicken here for lunch on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant first time my family and i Went There we absolutely fell in love with it the cream butter curry chicken dish is amazing the vegetarian dish are to die they give you the choice of level of spice you want in your food  the service is fast they are very clean and have a warm hospitality and I can't complain about the price it's very good"}
{"text":"Our friend Aron recommended this little place that is just a few blocks from our home, so we gave it a shot.
Walked in at 11:30 am on a Saturday.    It was empty except for one man in the restaurant who was busy on the phone.   We stood awkwardly for about two minutes in front of him until he finally said, \"Yes?\"
He didn't even bother to take the phone away from his ear.
We said we'd like to order Repas Royal for 2 (dal soup, tandoori chicken, poulet tikka, seekh kebab,  tandoori shrimp, lamb curry, vegetables, naan bread, rice  and Gulab Jamon for dessert) and an order of onion bhaji, all for takeout.
He said it would take at least 40 minutes.
We asked about delivery, he said it would cost $4.00 and would take longer to arrive at our home because he had to call the guy.    Ugh, ok.    We decided to order, go somewhere for a coffee and come back to pick it up.     He never put down the phone the entire time we were there.
  
Fast forward 45 minutes.....the restaurant is still completely empty.    No sign of the man on the phone.   We wait.
He finally shows up with the food in bags.    $46.00 for lunch which we take home.
The food.....VERY small portions.     Soup was just ok.   Everything tasted the exact same, which we found so strange.    
We never received the seekh kebab but we didn't want to go back so we just took it as a loss.
Vegetables were a mix of fresh and frozen cooked together.    
Shrimp was frozen, so was the meat - they defrost it in warm sauce once an order comes in.    
Onion bhaji was greasy and mostly batter.
The one high spot was the naan bread - it was very good.

We're huge fans of Indian food and being in NDG, we are spoiled for choice.
We won't choose this place again.    We'll stick with Maison India or Ganges on Sherbrooke."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only Indian resto in this neck of the off the beaten path NDG. The store front says \" Yagel Bagel\", but go right in , you're at the right place. The establishment is small, only a few tables, and I've only ever been here for lunch, and so far so good. Reasonably priced , well prepared Indian food, perhaps not gourmet, but good nonetheless. I never had to wait forever to get served and the food was always piping hot, and prepared as I prefered. (medium spiced) There are 2 menus, 1 a la carte and a special lunch menu, featuring the veggie or meat thali, or briyani, with daal soup & naan, extra. The soup could have used an extra flavouring  of something or other, the naan was good & served toasty warm, the  chicken thali better than at some other places I've tried. The only other dishes I've ever had were: chicken Kashmiri, chicken Korma and the ever popular butter chicken... all good.  Overall, I've always left the place feeling pretty good, satiated and happy to have been referred here by a colleague."}
{"text":"Outstanding. After decades of dining at Indian restaurants all over Montreal, we find this absolute gem right in NDG. The best Indian cooking we've enjoyed since the Bombay Palace on Ste Catherine St closed its doors."}
{"text":"The. Real. Deal. 

Finally, after months of beating the bushes and getting greasy fast food Indian everywhere we followed a trail to Express Indien and I'm putting it down as the best we've found of the dozen or more Montreal places. The small dining room isn't fancy but it's not gross either. It's a little hole in the wall place and the chef came out to talk to us--that kinda place. 

Perfect pakoras, flakey and not at all greasy. Wife got the chicken Tikka Masala, I got butter paneer, both were excellent. Lassi was great, naan was great, rice was solid. Everything you could ask for in real Indian that's neither served from a bucket nor pretending to be fancy. Go give these people your business."}
{"text":"I've had the best thali of my life at this small, friendly restaurant on Somerled. Under $10 you can have almost half a pound of delicious food ! What I liked the most was the choice of dishes available to include in our thali and the possibility to have it more spicy. Also, the service is really quick and the people are so kind ! And they deliver!!! :)"}
{"text":"The taste is there , les plats sont preparés avec soin , saveurs delicats, bonne presentation, la deco un peu simpliste mais seems clean.. dans un quartier méconnu."}
