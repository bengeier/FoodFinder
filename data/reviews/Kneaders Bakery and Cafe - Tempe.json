{"text":"Like the food and atmosphere but service is almost always poor.  Free refills on French toast and pancakes but you are always an afterthought at that point.  The wait is often very long as if they are telling you not to consider ordering a refill again.  No sense of urgency by staff at busy times.  Will be a long time if I ever return."}
{"text":"Personally I think this is/is going to be a better location than one on Ray. Staff was more professional and courteous, all the samples were fresh (so moist!!) and tasty, and our purchase from the bakery was so good. Haven't tried the deli food yet but at a glance they looked good, too. Will return soon and hoping that I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I awoke this morning and looked in the fridge - what stared back at me was a head of organic lettuce and a bottle of champagne.  Dismayed I checked the pantry only to find soup and some expired almonds.  And most importantly, no coffee to make.  I laid down in the fetal position on the floor.  How did this happen?  How did I neglect my grocery reserves for so long?  How am I going to function at work with no breakfast?  I thought all hope was lost, that I would simply have to go slightly hungry today, or worse buy a crummy bagel at my place of employment.  Through a foggy haze I had a thought, I could buy breakfast before work!  After all I had woken up to a healthy direct deposit laying in my bank account like an angel from above so I could spare a few bucks.  But where to go?  Dunkin Donuts? Starbucks? Einsteins?  All were out of my way and would cause me to be late for work.  I quickly googled, \"breakfast places near xxxxxx\" and kneaders popped up.  I arrived around 7:30am eager to fulfill my breakfast needs.  When I walked in it was as if I stepped back in time to an olde tyme bakery.  I quickly began scanning the menu for my prize.  Ultimately I selected the sausage egg and cheese sandwich with an iced coffee.  I selected a table and awaited my bounty.  About 10 minutes later I was presented with a breakfast sandwich fit for a king.  10 minutes may seem like a long time, but I could tell the eggs were freshly made, the sausage was real sausage, and the croissant was buttery (but not greasy face buttery).  So yes, slower than your convenience place but well worth it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Come on man!  This place is so pretty inside! The pastries are presented beautifully! And their food smells sooo delicious... But  Our breakfast took 22 min to come out to us... (They have a drive through... So should I have gone through the drive through instead?)  They ran out of coffee and couldn't replace it until I bugged them multiple times and still she didn't replace it until new people came in to work and I approached them. It's a breakfast pace with no coffee? My suggestion: go through the drive through and bring your food inside.  Sorely disappointed kneaders.. *smh*"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I am very impressed with how the employees interact with customers. I truly felt like I was a person versus feeling like just a regular customer. Employees are true professionals and Marvin (the manager) really emulated top notch customer service! Marvin helped, answered questions, walked the floor, greeted & talked to customers and was very knowledgeable about the product. He is a true ambassador for Kneaders & I would clone him to have managers like him all over Arizona! I will continue to come to this location and will let all my military friends know about my great experiences here! Thank you Marvin!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband is always on the search for a good, home-made like brownie and he's found them at Kneaders. They have Cream Cheese, German Chocolate and Regular brownies that he can't get enough of. The cinnamon roles are fantastic and even better, the people who work there are always super friendly. They brighten your day. I don't write reviews often, but had to for this place. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Walked in to great looking pastries and small menu. Decided what we wanted only problem was there was no one to take order. One staff member seemed to be running the whole show ( I think her name was Stacy give her a raise). Poor girl was doing dining room, drive trough, cash, while another competent cashier was assembling baskets and management no where to be seen. She finally Managed to catch her breath long enough to take our order, walked out, coffee empty as well as half and half, pet peeves to have to ask someone to fill them they should be full! Food decent, nothing special, longer I sat there chatting with my breakfast company the more I could see other customers getting irritated that there was no one to take orders when they came in, one guy even yelled to someone who appeared to be a baker, \"hey is there anyone who can take my order!?\" Management get a clue, come support your staff!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the pastries and smoothies. Friendly service. It takes way way way too long to receive your meal. Doesn't matter if it's drive threw order or you go inside. I ordered a slice of cheesecake that is pre-made and waited about 15 mins if not longer."}
{"text":"The food is so so good. Delicious bacon only $1/a side order!! The muffin tops are amazing. Clean and friendly. Fresh delicious food!!"}
{"text":"This was a good bakery and café.  The food was very fresh and bread tasted heavenly. We went there at lunch time and the line was very long. We had the Chicken citrus salad and the turkey , bacon and avocado salad. Both were delicious but we had to wait about 35 minutes to get our order (we dined in the restaurant ). After we placed our order, one of my friends was told that they were out of the soup that she ordered; at least we were stopped at the cashier when we tried to order bottled water...they were completely OUT at noon on a Monday! To their credit,  they did give her another soup of her choice as well as a free loaf of pumpkin bread. That made up also for continuing to forget our free birthday dessert.  Something was definitely off with their service today but we will try them again. ..not soon though."}
{"text":"I have been twice for breakfast using the drive through.  Both times the wait was really long - 8 minutes one day, 6 the next. The first time the lady in front of my was only handed a smoothie.  The second time it seemed like a large order may have caused the delay.   The sandwich tasted good and was served very hot, which I appreciate.  I like the selection of breads.  I tried the Asagio bread and the hazelnut grain bread.  Both were delicious.  The chunks of hazelnut may be a bit large for some people.   Not sure I will continue to go here.  The breakfast sandwich was just one piece of bread cut in half with the egg, ham and cheese on it.  The total was over $5.  A little expensive for me."}
{"text":"Restaurant itself is amazing. However today I almost got ran off the road by a delivery truck driver who was on their phone... After calling the business I came to find out it was THE MANAGER of the location driving the truck!!! They really need to have better driving skills!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for our first visit today with my family. Needless to say it was a great first experience. They had so many little treats to pick from! And I'm not talking about just cookies and desserts! They had cute little gifts you could purchase too! They lady who took our order was friendly and had great recommendations for our family. Your food was scrumptious and super tasty! I can say I would recommend the turkey cranberry! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love Kneaders, usually. Today I ordered a pesto chicken panini. Got home and there was no pesto on my sandwich. It was completely dry. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Rediculous! My husband after working a 10 hour day on Valentine's Day stoped by to pick up a call in order I did after waiting in line for 20 min they said something must of happen and they did not get my phone in order.  Then said let me call my manger after 10 more min about an hour total from when it's supposed to be done with myself and two hungry children at home waiting he was told to leave his name and number so the manager can call him later tonight.  It completely just blows my mind, at very minimum they should have said lets knock your order out and get you and your family fed and deal with the rest of it later. But nope no food an hour lost and charged my cc... lost my business forever"}
{"text":"been here about 5 times. food is ok, but service is pretty bad. every single time they messed up our order somehow. seem to be staffed with morons."}
{"text":"I just love their pastries!! Delicious breakfast sandwiches  too! I recommend the croissant egg and bacon sandwich there!  The inside of the store is kind of like Cracker Barrel, relax feminine atmosphere in my opinion they have things to decorate your home or do crafts with."}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:19 and the place was empty. My first impression was that it looked Christmasy and like a gift shop almost. So, I get to the register and order a turkey bacon avocado salad w/o bacon. Cashier was knowledgeable and was able to tell me everything that came on the salad. I paid about $9 for a half salad and a drink. I get my salad and it is NOTHING special. It's just lettuce with about 4 grape tomatoes some over salted turkey, 4 strips of avocado and some ranch dressing on the side. On the side I got two pieces of wheat bread. Nothing special about any of it , salad was a little below average. Panera/paradise is a LOT better than this place. The atmosphere, food, taste just everything was better. I was disappointed that I got some basic ranch dressing w $7 salad. And that the bread wasn't good either. Overall just not for me"}
{"text":"The chicken, ham, and cheese on focaccia is my all-time favorite sandwich. It is HUGE and delicious. I also bought most of the desserts for my wedding from Kneaders and they were a hit. The cream cheese brownie is incredible. Absolutely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"All of there breads that are made everyday are amazing. The cinnamon French Toast is a must get."}
{"text":"Love this place! The French toast is so good and we always get the cinnamon bread and pumpkin bread to take home. Their gift baskets are really nice and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Second trip to this place, and decided to order online 45 minutes prior, so that I could just pop in, pick it up and leave.  Sadly, that wasn't the result.  I didn't even order anything hard - a half salad and cup of soup.  I waited almost 15 minutes.  It seemed like they were totally unprepared for the lunchtime rush.  Then they forgot part of my order. The salad was pretty good - BBQ chicken - but there were only maybe 5 little slivers of chicken.  The soup was ok - loaded baked potato - it had good flavor but was not thick like a good potato soup would be. Finally, the peach tart that was forgotten.  My second (and last) dessert experience was not good.  Something in the tart and the pumpkin cake I had previously has a weird flavor and smell to it - like what I imagine dog shampoo smelling and tasting like.   Sadly, despite it's close proximity to my job, I will not be returning.  I'd rather go to Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Just came from fasting & a blood draw so obviously I was ready for some good eating to get me filled back up.  This place was not the place for that.  Ordered an Italian omelette and it was not even an omelette as it just looked like 1 (maybe 2) eggs scrambled and then mixed with the other couple of ingredients. The \"toast\" was also very soft & mushy.  I will include a pic so you can see what I'm saying.  Anyone can create a bad meal if they are having a bad day, but then when that is topped off with  nobody coming to your table to check on your meal so that you can tell them about it and you also leave no way to contact the restaurant on the receipt to provide some honest feedback regarding your meal.....that tells me they aren't interested in what their customers have to say.  Depending on how this is handled will determine if I return to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Tagged along with family as they dropped by here to get gingerbread cookies.  My sister apparently likes this place.  The interior of the store is quite nice (I remember the lighting being very soft and flattering).  There is quite a bit of food merchandise (pancake mix, candy, gift baskets) and, weirdly, a display nook of costume jewelry and a handbag.  They also have very large pastry case displays filled with goodies.  I do think the baked goods look \"too perfect\" and mass produced though (this was a red flag).  The cashier was pleasant.  While family members seemed to enjoy the treats, I found them lacking.  The gingerbread man (with chocolate pants, a detail family enjoyed) had a very dry texture and was somewhat \"dog biscuit-like\" (very bland and crumbly).  The peppermint brownie was HALF frosting (chocolate frosting over peppermint frosting/creme over a chocolate chip brownie), which attempted to distract from the fact that the brownie itself was on the dry side, but it didn't make up for the loss of brownie \"gooey-ness.\"  I won't seek this place out again, but I would veto it for lunch either.  We really need a high-quality bakery cafe to replace the Panera-fied and bastardized Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"Where is the manager here? These poor teens are trying to run the restaurant by themselves and so far two people have walked out because of over a 30min wait to get their food. There are numerous other people currently in line who have been waiting for over 15min. There should be a manager here, this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Saw their menu for breakfast and was pleased to see they had an option for fruit and a half sandwich. (Exactly what I was craving). Their breakfast starts at 7:00... I came in at 8:30(ish) and ordered the half sandwich and fruit combo... to find they hadn't cut their fruit yet. Personally having been in management in a similar style cafe, I found that a bit ridiculous.... so I opted for the sausage sandwich... to be told they didn't have that (inventory issues...also unacceptable..... but a little more understandable as it is Monday and maybe they had a big weekend breakfast rush)... I went to fill my cup with ice and noticed the soda machine was FILTHY... like their closers must not have cleaned it, nor did the opening crew bother to wipe it down. Much too filthy to have been done in an hour and a half with the very small amount of people in their lobby.  Now being as I worked in the restaurant industry I'm not much of a yelper. I realize restaurants have good and bad days. But this is 3 issues on my first attempt at getting breakfast here..... not pleased. The only good thing about my service was my cashier (Alishia) remained calm and collective regardless of my obvious annoyance... I almost felt brushed off by it... but I'm glad she will continue to smile and go throughout her day regardless of a annoyed customer at 8:30 in the morning."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh and friendly! The French toast is so good! Worth the upgrade for a smoothy and the kids could bring the pastry for their teachers. What a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I had a morning filled with meetings and needed to grab something to keep my stomach happy through lunch.  The American omelette was just right. Eggs nice and thin, perfectly wrapped around nice chunks of ham and pieces of broccoli. Two slices of toast rounded it out ideally.  A lovely quiet spot to eat a fulfilling breakfast that won't leave you hungry in 20 minutes, but also won't take an hour or break the bank! #lfthx #kneaders #kneadersbakery #organicad #kneaderstempe"}
{"text":"I pretty much eat dinner here every Wednesday night.  I would say I have been doing that since maybe August.  I have never had one issue here with the food.  It has always been fresh and yummy.  I have tried the various sandwiches at this place and been happy with them.  Last night was a ham and swiss sandwich, BBQ chips and chocolate cake.  The food was all good and yummy.  I even sampled some of the asiago bread and had them use that for my sandwich too.  What a great place and I am not sure why the rating is where it is at for this place."}
{"text":"Their turkey bacon avocado sandwich was amazing!!! By how many people were there, they got my order out relatively quick!  I usually go for their delicious breakfast but got a sandwich instead this time and it did not disappoint. But I do love their breakfast and will be going back again! #LFTHX"}
{"text":"Terrible! Avoid! The bread on my sandwich was stale. There was literally next to no meat on it. Requested onions and got next to none. Called, and the 19 year old manager said to come get a replacement. Keep in mind, this is a 20 minute drive for me! But what choice did I have? Food poisoning or make the drive? I'm met with the WORST apology ever, handed my sandwich, and that's it. No refund of even a portion of the money I spent. No offer of even a cookie. Just take your sandwich, despite how inconvenient it was to get it, and make the 20-minute Trek home. Oh no! I lied. They offered me a bag. In case it was so hard to carry the container. When I get home, I realize that the sandwich was still messed up! Needless to say, I'm not going to drive another 20 minutes to get it corrected. So I call up the manager! And this time what I get is another half-hearted apology, and that's it! So, my review is pretty simple. The food quality is disgusting. The customer service, is pathetic. The service, is ridiculously slow. Would I recommend this place to anyone? Maybe an enemy. Or someone I want  to have food poisoning. But not to anybody I actually cared about. Again, buyer beware! They certainly do not live up to their hype."}
{"text":"This place is one of my go-to's for grabbing a quick, healthy salad on the cheap. I finally tried a dessert tonight and holy chocolate it was delicious! The staff at this location are very friendly."}
{"text":"Hmm. I wanted to like them much more because they are a great close-by dining option for lunch. Been there twice now but I haven't been impressed at all by any of their sandwiches. Mind you the actual BREAD is pretty good but that's where the great flavors seem to end. Might as well grab a loaf there and make my own sandwiches at home. So you walk in, stand in line while watching all the items for sale. Then you get to the cash register and pay. Then you wait what seems like half an eternity to get your food. Of course it might just seem that way because there seems to be no system for the people delivering the trays to know who ordered what - no numbers to put on your table - the folks with the trays just go around shouting names and what was ordered until they find the right table. This is kind of silly because there are tables all around the perimeter of the restaurant and I'm sure it adds greatly to the wait time. They have loyalty cards but I don't think I'll fill mine up any time soon. Parking is a real clusterfarkle. They're building yet another business between Jimmy John's/Smashburger and Kneader's and in case the parking situation doesn't already bite - just wait till they're done."}
{"text":"Horrible location! After my experience today I will never go here again and I suggest you don't either. I arrived at 12:06 and ordered a turkey,bacon, avocado salad with no tomatoes Took 25 min to get my order. I drove to work to go eat and open the salad and the only thing on it are turkey and onion. It was missing everything else. I call to complain they say they will fix it and to come back. (This sounded good so far minus me having to leave work again and postponing lunch 2 hours) I arrive back and they said they will fix it right away and give me my money back. That's when I wait again...and continue to wait. There are 4 people in the restaurant why it took more then 5 min to remake a salad I have no idea. 15 minutes later I was still waiting. I had an appointment at 2 so I just ask for the manager so I can get my money back. He asked what I wanted and I said I wanted my money back and I did want my salad but I have to go and this wait has been ridiculous. That's when the cook looked over at me and said, \"If you want your salad so back why don't you F***ing come back here and make it yourself\". I was shocked that a place of business is run like this. You have loser my business and my friends and family for good!"}
{"text":"Great customer service as last time. I tried the chicken salad it comes on a croissant. While it didn't taste bad it was too grown up for me not sure if it had potatoes in it or what. Too many crunchy things for me, next time I go I will ask what's in it. I do not like onions and tried to just pick around the crunchy items. My 7 year old said it was good. I also got a new bracelet while I was there and joined their frequent diners reward program."}
{"text":"This Kneaders is always consistent when it comes to business catering. Our office is located at Broadway and the 101 and this location never fails to make our deliveries on time. The ONE time our delivery wasn't on time was because a change to the delivery time was never noted on the order, and the Kneaders staff took it upon themselves to send along a gift basket of popcorn and seasonal loaves of pumpkin/cranberry breads to express their apologies for not handling the order properly.  Everyone in our office loves the Kneaders Best - Continental Breakfast. Comes with OJ or Coffee and an assortment of pastries. The pastries are so large that many people here cut them in half to try a variety of what's available, and everyone swears they're delicious."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh. I love the veggie avocado sandwich, and the hazelnut bread is amazing. Good smoothie menu as well. I do appreciate having a drive through for a healthy fast food option, but the drive through took 30 minutes. Way too long. Also, the kids sandwiches only come with sourdough bread. They should have the option for whole wheat."}
{"text":"I used to like this place.That has all changed. I went there today to grab a quick bite for lunch. I love their chicken salad sandwich on croissant but as I'm watching my carbs, I asked if they could substitute the bread for a bed of lettuce. A special order, if you will. Well, apparently, special orders are not their specialty. They offered to make me the Turkey Avocado salad and instead of turkey, sub the chicken salad. I said that was fine, I didn't care as long as it had the chicken salad. The drive-thru person I spoke with said, \"That will be $12.49.\" Not bad, a little pricey but for a good salad, I'm willing to pay that. When I get to the window, the cashier says it's actually $14.29. I ask why the difference in price? She said the manager overheard our conversation and said the chicken salad costs more than the turkey. Basically, I paid $15.00 for a crappy a salad that had barely any chicken in it and guess what? No avocado either!! I could have gotten a bigger and better salad anywhere else. Congratulations, Kneader's! You just lost a customer over $1.80! I hope it was worth it. I will NEVER return to this establishment, which is a bummer because it is so close to my office. Oh well, I know there are far better places out there."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE GM JAKE LAYTON RIPPING ON HIS OWN FOOD Yeah I wouldn't recommend chicken at a fast casual establishment if you want prime chicken breast meat. We offer the best turkey I have ever eaten and the chicken is not the quality of the turkey  UPDATE: Jake is not nice. He likes engaging customers via email and trying to defend his chain's crappy food rather than accepting that the customer is right. Jake won't last in that industry long in the age of social media.   Will start with the good. They hired a new manager (Jake from Utah) and he reached out to me to offer a free meal from a bad meal that I had way back in February. Jake was very nice and anybody who leaves three stars or less on a review will likely get the free meal offer. I ordered the chicken chopped salad and he threw in a free pastry, which is the only reason this place didn't get one star.   The pecan tart - half covered with chocolate - was excellent, but the salad had major issues. A good portion of the chicken was inedible due to fatty pieces of meat. Some of the chicken was in strips, but there were alot of odd chicken pieces also tossed in there as well. Finally, a salad needs good lettuce, but I couldn't eat 75% of the lettuce served. Most of the lettuce was brown, wet and had a dark, dark green color. Well Jake, you might be the GM, but he needs to improve the food quality, not just offer disgruntled guests another bad meal."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've ever had. Food is tremendous and my daughter enjoyed her Valentine's day cookie"}
{"text":"Small salads and nothing special, it's really nice looking inside but the food wouldn't bring me back. I'd rather go to wildflower if I am looking for this type of food, same price but larger portions and real utensils."}
{"text":"Staff was so friendly and the breakfast French toast was a great treat! #lfthx #kneaders #kneadersbakery #organicad #kneaderstempe"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the turkey croissant today.  It had very little turkey, two tiny wilted pieces of lettuce.  I took it as a take out so I didn't realize how poorly made it was until I arrived at home. .  I will return because normally I've gone to this location for sandwiches, pastries but mainly for the sourdough bread and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Sorry for the half-eaten photo; I just could barely stop eating to take the picture it was so good! I'm a huge fan of warm breakfasts but I also don't have any time in the morning and I'm also kind of picky, so Kneaders breakfast sandwiches are perfect for me! I highly recommend the sausage/cheese/egg croissant; the cheese is folded into the egg and everything is right in the world when you start your day with this deliciousness. Plus, it's Monday; I had to reward myself for making it here, right?!"}
{"text":"Great food, and good service. After I had called in my order and Picked it up.. I got home to realize they had given me the wrong order, I called to tell them... and since I was close they delivered the right meal to my house.  Very happy that they dis"}
{"text":"Absolutely love eating at this location however today makes me want to go elsewhere, the gal behind the counter was rude and acted like we were interrupting her me time. I totally feel if you aren't a morning person or you don't like working with the public don't get a job in the food industry. If this person would take a happy pill I would give this place a 5 star rating because the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Great new place right off the 101. I enjoy the convenience of a drive thru with the quality of a bakery."}
{"text":"Normally I think Kneaders is pretty decent but not this time.  I ordered a hatch green Chile and pork stew.  It tastes like spicy water with chunks of meat in it.  I use the word meat to loosely describe whatever it was floating in the soup.  It's almost like the recipe called for a cup of spices to cover up the lack of flavor.  If you want a soup I'm sure the other soups are fine.  Just don't order this one."}
{"text":"Maybe a 2.5 only because of the coffee!! Food was good what I didn't like was the Iced coffee's if they want to compete with other coffee shops this coffee HAS TO IMPROVE BIG TIME!!  It was bitter I got the different ones all bitter I had to throw them away! (money down the drain)"}
{"text":"Awful. F this place. I work for Doordash and I came to pick up an order for a customer and the service here is f'n ridiculous."}
{"text":"The bacon avocado salad is a nice compliment to all the delicious desserts Kneaders offers. Their french toast is also my favorite breakfast on the block!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Pesto Chicken Sandwich with no onions... the \"sandwich\" was barely a sandwich at best. Minimal chicken, and no pesto at all.  Also, ordered a \"bag of chips\"... it looked like someone's child ate half the bag and then sold it to me.  Maybe Kneader's is strictly for people dieting... I really don't know. Paradise Bakery will always be my number one."}
{"text":"Don't count on either fast or accurate service for takeout.  With four people doing the work of two behind the counter it should be easy to do better.  Food is barely passable, and poor service too."}
{"text":"Yes the bread is amazing. Their morning staff is awful.  Waited 25 minutes for an order of French toast,  had 2 people ask me about it,  only 1 helped.  Horrible service in the morning.  Breakfast food is ok, maybe their lunch is better.  Go at night,  the manager is really nice at that time."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the low reviews.  I really love this place.  The only negative is that the service is soooooooo slow.  I always get soup in a bread bowl and a smoothie.  My favorite soup is the white cheddar poblano.  They didn't have any this week so I got artichoke portabello and that was pretty good also.  My girls like the cream of broccoli.    The smoothie I get is the pink pina colada made with peach juice instead of guava juice.  This time we bought the triple chocolate bread and brought it home for breakfast the next morning.  Was super yummy."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, this place is ridiculously over priced for what you actually get. There were three of us, two got a drink, and it was $33.    We ordered a Reuben sandwich, there were only three small slices of corned beef on the entire sandwich! A Reuben is supposed to feature mainly the beef! Luckily it tasted pretty good, but you can't recover from a $10 sandwich (with no drink and stale potato chips) that has no meat! They also put onions on their Reuben, which feels like a sin. That's just not a Reuben, which is I guess why it's with the paninis, but still.   The French Dip had the exact same problem, absolutely no meat, except it was worse because it had no flavor either. I love au jus more than anything, I've actually never met an au jus I didn't like, but this one lacked any sort of flavor.   Then the chips, I'm not sure if they were house chips or what. I can't describe them adequately because they were a mixture of soggy but stale. It was weird.   TLDR: Over priced. Not enough meat. Soggy/stale house chips. Okay taste."}
{"text":"Great place to get a Reuben. I've been to this location multiple times and love it. Also, don't forget to get one of their cinnamon rolls! Seriously the closest thing to my moms homemade ones. #LFTHX"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I've only been here one time but the first impression was solid. The staff was very friendly and was always smiling. The food itself was way above average. I frequent places like Paradise and Wildflower and the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich I had here was much better quality than anything I get from the competitors. I also liked their little \"store,\" and appreciated the assortment of pastries. The only knock was that there were a few tables that remained dirty for the entire time we were there (about 20 minutes). If they press for a quicker cleanliness check, this place will be 5 stars for what it is."}
{"text":"Ehhhh........I don't like to give one star. This is nothing more than a step down from a Paradise Bakery. I ordered a scramble for breakfast and when they brought it to my table it looked like it been dropped on the floor then scooped up on a plate.  When what I assumed was the manager walks by he asks me how my breakfast was, I didn't say anything, I just gave him the most dis-satisfied look I could possibly give and pointed at my eggs............and walks away. WTH??  Next time I come in and dis-satisfied with my meal, I'll be sure to stand on my chair and announce that my breakfast looks like a 5 year cooked for the first time and it tastes like COMPLETE CRAP. As he continued to make his rounds, he refused to make eye contact with me and avoided my table within 10 feet.........good customer service buddy.   Plenty of other options in that parking lot. There's a pile of dirt to the right that might taste just as good."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here for lunch so I can't say how the breakfast is. The sandwiches are fresh and the bread. But do NOT go here if you are in a hurry or want a quick meal. I went here before and knew it took a while so I ordered online when I arrived they hadn't received my order in which I paid for. I had to speak with three different associates before they finally started to make my meal. After 15 minutes I finally received my food. Paradise is definitely a quicker option!"}
{"text":"I heard how good this place was from co-workers so I decided to give it a try. I. Was not impressed. I had the Turkey Avocado Bacon salad my friend had a chicken salad and they forgot to put the chicken in it. The salad was a salad nothing special. We also had dessert. I had the Napoleon. All you could taste was whipped cream. There was hardly any pastry cream on it. All that whipped cream was making me sick. My friend had the Triple chocolate pudding cake. She wasn't impressed with that either.  Nothing special just a chocolate cake with chocolate chips and chocolate frosting.  Service was fine.  I wouldn't go back again.  I can make the same salad at home and probably a better Napoleon."}
{"text":"All I need to say is take down the CHUNKY CINNAMON name out of the French toast if they're gonna give me plain ass French toast I can get anywhere?"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to an appointment and was not disappointed. This place was amazing! You must try the new unicorn eclair, loved it!! The cinnamon rolls are great, fresh and perfectly cinnimony!! Don't forget the fresh OJ too! Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So, Saturday morning at Kneader's is a disaster. Long line and only one register open. Staff doesn't even smile. They move at a snail's pace. Ordered all you can eat french toast at 9:50. Waited 20+ minutes to get it. Asked for refill at around 10:20 and still waiting for it at 10:50... 25 minutes ago they said we'd have it in 3 minutes...What a joke! I gave 2 stars because the food is tasty, if you can ever get it."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for breakfast! The french toast were delicious and the drive-thru makes this a conveniant stop!"}
{"text":"Went to this location again after noon and as usual they are out of chicken salad so I can't order it.  Since this happens every time I go there after the lunch crowd is gone why don't they anticipate and make a little more?  It's a terrible customer experience to always have them say we are out of it, find a different sandwich.   I don't go during the lunch rush because the drive through you wait for a very long time to order.  It's also really hard to find a clean table so I rarely eat inside this location."}
{"text":"at minimum we expect good service and ..for us..hot coffee. it's self serve and they have 2 reg. coffee options,  both were cold. we notified the staff and then 15 minutes later had to remind then again. no one was in the restaurant and plenty of staff walking around in the afternoon.  10 min later the new pot arrived with an apology. we tried it...cold coffee.  the staff person apologised ..dais the extra pot was supposed to be bit not apparently no one chucked it. she said she would make a new fresh pot. 15 min later the pot arrived.  it was hot but the 2nd dark roast pot never showed up.  nor will we next time.   the carrot cake was delicious but needed our coffee we paid for. details count."}
{"text":"The baguette is too soft, not crispy enough.  I don't know why but they have a tendency to undercook their bread. I've tried the french dip but after seeing the picture on yelp, i asked them to add extra veggies because it looked pretty simple for a $6.59 sandwich! Even with that extra, it was not great. There is no sauce. Just ham and swiss cheese in a baguette. I think the Ciabatta is my favorite bread. The salads were pretty good too. Potato salad as a side was nice. I don't like their soup."}
{"text":"Why did it take so long for me to come to this place? I love it, delicious food! I recommend the French Toast!  ......now I'm trying to make this review long enough for them to post it... Kneaders is awesome! My wife loves the decor."}
{"text":"First time in I decided to order the Thai Chicken salad. My daughter ordered chicken salad on a croissant. We both \"added\" a smoothie/frappe to our order because they offered a 50 cent discount if you \"add\" it to your order. We also brought our own cups because we do our best to not use plastic but they refused to use them claiming \"health department rules\". We use our cups at Starbucks and Panera no problem. So we asked them to put the drinks in one of their compostable cups to save using plastic which seemed to really put it them out. My salad was delivered without the chicken. And my salad wasn't anything special (once I got my chicken). Just OK. My drink, however, was terrible! I decided to give it back to them! They did offer an apology and refunded the drink (and $1 credit for the combo mistake)"}
{"text":"The design is not ideal so You wait in line for too long but that gives time to see all of the pastries and breads. The food comes out hot and fresh and the coffee was rich and pleasant.  A bit on the  pricey side for breakfast, but worthy for brunch. Clean and modern establishment.  Will try again."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Consistently. And they give you good portions of meat on your sandwich, not like subway or Panera bread (across the street.) One of my favorite restaurants and worth every penny - I look forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow in the drive through line. Stuck here for 20 mins just for a salad and I am still waiting. You want a quick lunch, don't come here . Food is standard but they need to improve management."}
{"text":"I've had their pastries ... but the first time coming in here for lunch. My daughter and I decided to try it out... and OMG!!! Amazing, the soup is sooooo good (Irish Stew) and the sandwich's are so yummy!!!  I got the turkey, bacon, avocado on focaccia...so fresh and soft is the bread. My daughter said the dip for the French dip was amazing.  We will be coming back again, and bringing friends.   #lfthx #kneadersonelliott #kneaders #lfthx_chandler/tempe #kneaders #kneadersbakery #organicad #kneadersonelliotintempe"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times have been delicious. The first time I went here I got the BBQ chicken salad and the chipotle ranch dressing that comes with it is very tasty! The second time I went here I got half of a veggie avocado sandwich and although it was simple (avocado, onions, lettuce, cheese, & Kneader's sauce), it was really good. I will be coming back for a whole sandwich! I just wish they had a couple of vegetarian soups, then this place would be perfect. Love that they have a drive thru too."}
{"text":"Not horrible. No sandwich descriptions on the overhead menu. Staff couldn't tell me what was on the sandwiches or in the smoothies. No familiarity with the product they were selling.  Ordered safe: a BLT. Not so safe. Red onions, mustard, and cheese. Not outrageous, but not part of a standard BLT. If your product deviates significantly from the norm, say something.  Ordered safe: a French Dip. Again with the red onions - and this time an au jus with balsamic vinegar? Ok...  White chocolate macadamia nut cookie? Stale, but tasted ok. Eclair? Hard, hard Pâte à Choux filled with cheap whipped cream (possibly artificial).  Quick adds to original review:  The bread itself was tasty :-) My smoothie was chunky with unknowns :-(  Save your money, time, and taste buds.  Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy John's. They have a menu that tells you what is on their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Today (3/22/17) has by far been my worst experience at the tempe kneaders. First no employee would even acknowledge the line building up at the register, and once I finally got to place my order, it took nearly 30 minutes get my order of French toast to, and when it arrived, it was cold and had likely been sitting out for a while. If you want good service and warm food, go to the one in Gilbert but don't bother with this place. I give it a two because they did remake my food (which only took about 5 minutes)"}
{"text":"I have been hitting this place up a lot recently for my sandwich needs. I am currently enjoying the Ruben on rye and the sauce they use with it. I like that it feels a little less chainy with the different soups they have each day also with the homie decor inside.  The servers are actually really friendly here and make the experience much better than most places. They noticed I was frequenting their restaurant often so suggested I start using the loyalty card. When on the drive through it does take a little longer than a typical fast food place but I really don't mind as I know my sandwich is being made and not just sat there going stale.   I do wish they had more options that don't include bread. Salad bowls etc. If you are avoiding the carbs this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I really want to love this kneaders because I go so often and it's so close to the office. They just make it so difficult to give 5 stars. The food is always amazing! The to go service however is extremely poor! I have ordered at least 6 times since the new year. Every single time my order is NEVER ready and I even went 15 mins later than my arrival time, still the same outcome. That's not the worst part, the worst part is something is always wrong with my order. You would think I learned my lesson by now and check the bag, but I haven't. Sad part, I get the most basic lunch: Chicken Caesar salad and broccoli soup. Ugh! It's so frustrating! Unfortunately I will have to find another place near by that has comparable food."}
{"text":"The reason I give them one star is because we use to love kneaders! This location is WAY to slow!! Plus they always mess up our order. They've lost a customer for sure. We will never go back. Waiting 30-40 minutes for a salad or sandwich is insane!!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders but I just spent 12 minutes in the drive through waiting for 2 sandwiches and 2 desserts with my SCREAMING baby in the backseat. Their service is SO SLOW. They were hardly apologetic and there is no reason why it should have taken so long. I was NOT impressed and I will think twice before going back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is without a doubt some of the worst I have experienced. I have tried on several occasions to use Kneaders for business lunches as my office is close by. I place the order ahead of time and each time I have arrived they seem surprised by my request and have to find my order to start preparing it. This last time today it affected an important meeting for me. I waited for a half hour while they made 4 sandwiches and I watched the guy packing it up stop 4 times to text on his phone. He then took it somewhere and set it down. They had no idea anyone was waiting so I had to ask 2 different people to please get me my order. I have given this place several chances to redeem themselves but this is obviously a chronic problem. Not going back."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, and I have been misled.   I went with my wife and some family on a Saturday morning. After waiting for about 20 minutes for our food to come out, we  noticed people who ordered after us were getting their food before us.  I went back to the counter to ask and the cashier had no idea what I was talking about. No one actually gave our order to the kitchen staff.  No apologies.   Food finally came out about 10 minutes later. It's now been approximately 40 minutes since we ordered 2 bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches and a order of French toast.  My sandwich had 2 \"slices\" of bacon on a $7 sandwich. They were extremely thin and tiny.The French toast had strawberries in the side of butter.  Slow, expensive, rude, and misery best describe this location."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would! Went there and ordered turkey bacon on focaccia and two salads thru the drive thru the sandwhich wasn't what I ordered and I told the girl and she argued with me! So I just took in fear of her \"fixing\" it and then spitting in my food. When I got home the salads were all lettuce and a tiny about of chicken and croutons.. If I wanted a full head of lettuce I would have just ate the one I had in the fridge but I wanted some sustenance with my meal. Ugh never again will I visit this kneaders! They need to fire a lot of them at this location"}
{"text":"Always super fresh food and friendly service. The bread and yummy treats here are worth the carbs"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I'm writing this review. I had high hopes for this place. The inside is super cute, the boutique-style stuff they sell is darling, and the bakery goods were absolutely delicious looking. Most of the food we ordered was good. The service, not so much. Our order was wrong and the employee fought with me about it, saying I didn't order what I said I did. She was rude and unhelpful, and then said that we didn't pay for something that we had ordered and paid for. So I went inside to pay for it so my husband could eat, even though I KNOW I paid for it on the original receipt. I wasn't going to fight about it, and I wasn't going to let my husband sit there with no food while the rest of our group ate. Oh well. We won't be back. There are plenty of breakfast and bakery options in the vicinity."}
{"text":"The food is always good but I spent 20 minutes placing a pick up order using the app and it wouldn't let me pick a pickup time for today. so I phoned and the choice for talking to a manager just took me back to the main menu. Finally got a manager and was cut off. Finally got the manager back who would take my order but had no interest in fixing the app. \"I don't know anything about that but J can take you order over the phone.\""}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Kneaders, and I was impressed. Not only was the food great, but I also enjoyed the environment. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, and the croissant was so soft and flakey. My husband ordered a panini, which I had a bite of, and it was delicious. They had so many tasty looking pastries, it was hard to choose just one. Of course, since its Halloween, I went with a seasonal sugar pumpkin cookie. I will definitely be back. I can see myself coming here for lunch... I prefer this place over Panera."}
{"text":"Kneaders has always been a favorite of mine! From the pastries to the breakfast to their sandwiches, seriously it makes my heart happy! The staff here is super friendly and more than happy to help with any questions. They're ALL YOU CAN EAT French toast is totally my favorite! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It was very good, it tasted like food from a farmers market, fresh. I bought the chicken sandwich with avocado, loaf of sourdough which was delicious, and a razzle berry smoothie which was finished before getting to the house! FYI: Bakery sandwich drive through!! Awesome"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Food was incredible, huge portions. Split the turkey, beef and ham club with avocado. Half the sandwich was plenty of food! The cookies are seriously the best I've ever had and I bake a lot! Don't bother with Paradise Bakery. This place is way better! Definitely found a new favorite."}
{"text":"So the food here is good, the problem is they almost never get your order right.  I've gone here multiple times (at least 20 times) over the last couple of months and this location has only accurately given me my order about 20% of the time.    I ask for no mayo/kneader's sauce on my sandwiches and it almost always has sauce.  I ask to add avocado (which you pay more for) and it rarely gets the avocado.  I've also had extremely long waits in drive through (once over 35 minutes with no way out due to the design of the drive through)!  I don't generally write reviews but I had to add this review since my experience has been so poor.  Even though this place is very close to my work I'm going to have to call it quits :(."}
{"text":"OMG. I may gain an additional 50 pounds thanks to Kneaders.  My weakness is bread. Always has been...and kneaders is baking up a TON of fresh bread on the regular, nearly every type you can imagine, PLUS the dessert case is brimming with the best brownies, bread pudding, cake and pie that you have ever had.  Their sandwiches are huge, so if you order one, plan on sharing or having half of it to take home. And believe me, you will want to save room for pineapple cake, a cinnamon roll or brownies. BELIEVE ME.  They also server all you can eat french toast on the weekends. You are speaking my love language Kneaders!!! And why is is the best, melt in your mouth, gooey, cinnamony french toast ever?  Watch. 50 pounds are coming at me. UGH."}
{"text":"First time at Kneaders. The paninis were good and came with chips. We refrained from the sweet temptations on display. We will probably come back to try the breads and desserts, or for another sandwich due to proximity to our house, although there are other choices nearby. There is no Wi-Fi available, and if you are thinking about bringing your laptop, there is only one accessible plug to any of the tables."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for a quick dinner. We ordered a salad and a sandwich for the adults and a grilled cheese for the kid. We were all satisfied with the food. We didn't order any desert but everything they had looked delicious (in the bakery area). The establishment was clean and not too noisy. They had other options I'd like to try and we will be checking it out again."}
{"text":"Loved their freshly squeezed orange juice. I had pesto chicken panini which was decent. Great location!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch today from Kneaders Tempe. I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado salad, full order. I definitely have enough for two meals! Dressing was generous, so I used only half. It's flavorful, but a little light on the pulled turkey. Service was good - quick enough that I knew they were making the salad fresh for me. I love their retail area and was so tempted to buy several items. I'd go back for coffee and a little shopping the next time I have to shop for a girlfriend's bday or something like that!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I am sitting at Kneaders in Tempe and I ordered the Sourdough Pancakes with some coffee. What is remarkable is that I am one of 4 other patrons? I went by Biscuits, Wildflower, Marks Cafe (closed today) and Einsteins and they are all packed. In their own way all of those are good places to go but Kneaders has great food, respectful fast service and the atmosphere is good. Why are they not full of people as well?  I probably should mention the food. The coffee is hot and as good or better than most. The Sourdough pancakes are \"WONDERFUL\"! Frankly I think the best pancakes in the valley are at Joe's Cafe in Phoenix but I will drive to Kneaders for these Sourdough pancakes.  For those of you with Gluten issues, sourdough is \"safe\" for most of us. So it has been a grain product i can eat and still be conformable. They serve three of them (huge) with some sort of syrup and a whipped butter with strawberries. Yuummyy!  The music is not too loud and the tables have enough room between them to make it comfortable where ever you sit (unlike Wildflower).   I posted this and then realized I had left out the Pie. Sacre Bleu! They are really good with pie. If you get a pie craving in the afternoon drop everything and go to kneaders and get coffee and a slice of pie.   I can come here and set up my laptop, get some coffee and get all manner of work done.  Not sure why more people don't come here but I encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. But the sandwiches are just average. They have some interesting bakery items but since the cranberry sauce on the\"turkey cranberry crossaint \" was mostly liquid and lacking cranberries I would question how good they would be. At most this is good chain food. Greasy customer service."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to a Kneaders Bakery and I was pleasantly surprised by the price and quality of the meal.   I ordered the $5.99 Chunky Cinnamon French Toast and paid for the $3 combo which included coffee and a side of fruit or oatmeal. The French toast was the thickest slice of toast I believe I've ever had and it came with strawberries, cream and a caramel type of syrup. I didn't know what to think of the caramel syrup (I even asked for maple syrup, which they didn't carry) but surprisingly it all went well together.  I thought the staff were attentive and answered my questions. I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"I loved the set up of this location. It kind of reminds me of going home to the family home. I ordered a Mexican Omelette and a smoothie. I will be back to try all of the smoothies because the raspberry one was so delicious.  The Omelette comes with 2 pieces of bread and you can make it a combo with oatmeal or fruit w/ coffee or juice."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to where I work and is on my way home for my lunch break. Service at this location is extremely slow and placing an online order hardly remedies the situation. Numerous times have I arrived after the scheduled pick up time to find out my order is not ready and will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes. I don't recommend coming here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I have a busy day today so I stopped at Kneaders to pick up my breakfast and lunch. I chose one of their smoothies for breakfast and yummmmmy - the pink pina colada is the bomb. It'll be done within a minute. I can't wait to try the club sandwich. Is it lunch yet?!"}
{"text":"It was 230 p.m. and there was a wait. Of course I understand this.  Their menu is kinda complicated if you've never been here before.  Shouldn't they have a place on the menu board that says exactly what comes on a sandwich?  And you may order soup with your sandwich and they give you a salad too?  It doesn't say that on the menu board. So like I said, it can be complicated. So anyway, there's a wait. We order soup, water, and a dessert to share.  Why does it take as long for soup as it does a sandwich? Soup was nothing close to homemade.  In fact, it was very similar to soup from a can.  The Chicken Noodle was viscous like Campbell's soup.  Even Progresso has a better broth.  The noodles were kinda pasty.  The Tomato Basil Ravioli had my kid telling me Chef Boyardee.   Normally we have sandwich and soup so I've never focused on the soup.  This time I only had soup to focus on. I do like that they have soda water on the fountain.   We shared a slice of the Berry Cheesecake.  Super dense, creamy, and tasted like a marketed cheesecake complete with the flavor of the cardboard still on the graham cracker bottom. Hmmm. Must've been today's cook, huh?"}
{"text":"The bread here is great! You can tell the store runs smoothly as the staff Is friendly and relaxed. Turkey sandwich was just right, soup was great."}
{"text":"Great pastry and bread selection. Good coffee and a super cute retail section! I'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"$5.00 French toast buffet?!?! Can't go wrong with that for a lazy weekend brunch.   I got a takeout sandwich from here too and the people behind the counter were extremely friendly and smiley. Great new place"}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches and friendly service. Kneaders offers sandwiches, soups, and salads, with an impressive array of baked sweets. I stepped in here for lunch and browsed at the menu before deciding on the portabella grille sandwich, and a mint chocolate brownie.   The portabella grille, strangely enough, did not have much portabella in it. Instead it consisted mainly of roasted zucchini and red bell pepper. While the bread was very good, the actual ciabatta bread was so thick compared to the vegetable mixture that with each bite, I could taste mostly bread and little filling.   The mint chocolate brownie was decent, albeit super sweet.   Sodas are Coke based and there is a nice selection of iced teas to the side as well.  Although I wasn't too impressed with the portabella sandwich, I'd definitely like to try other items to see if they are any better!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, and i like that i can grab something yummy quickly through the drive through, especially as a working mom, and their service is great!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice and helpful staff. Plus breakfast is available until 11am!  I also appreciate that they use compostable coffee cups. Found another good place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Just- really good sandwiches. Grilled cheese is the bomb. Cookies are too thick for sugar cookies, but still good."}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly and the food is yummy. The pastries are always delicious. I love all of the seasonal pastries they offer! Last time I was here I had the spice cupcake which was great and this trip I tried their chocolate cookie which was dipped in crushed peppermint candies and it was amazing! I also love all of the samples they offer upon ordering, and they let you taste the soups before you decide. Excited to come back and try more goodies"}
{"text":"So I went to this location today and there was only one person in the drive thru.   I figured I'd finally give the drive thru a try and ordered there.  Big mistake!  I waited for over 10 minutes for only one person in front of me.  And when I finally got up to the drive thru window the woman who helped me was not friendly at all.  She opened the drive thru window and didn't say a word, not hi or how are you doing, she said nothing.  She did not seem to be enjoying her job at all.  So the lesson learned for me is to definitely not go through the drive thru at this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered online so I could pick up on my lunch (I work in a building in the same lot) and had to order a co-workers order when I got there. My food was ready upon arrival and I waited less than 5 minutes for my co-workers meal.   The food was delicious. My favorite part of my sandwich was the freshly made bread! Oh my!! I was always subjected to my family's raves about this place in Utah and now I can boast the same.   The thing that really stands out when you walk in though is the gourmet desserts and cute retail setup...oh and their amazingly friendly staff! Quick to offer a smile and assistance. I would go back just for the service really. Worth the $9 I spent on my sandwich that came with crispy chips and a pickle."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is not chopped. Didn't love the salad. Cashier was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today with a friend and our kids. She has been to other locations, and has had excellent customer service. This location however has horrible service, and we waited way too long for our food. Plus when the food came the croissants came out last and were not heated. When we asked to have them heated the girl asked us to hold on. After waiting forever another few minutes was not possible. Once we were done the server (cashier #6697) came back around and asked if we got our heated croissants. As she was the only one who knew we asked for them to be heated of course we did not get them heated! I would not return to this location as the service was terrible, and the food was mediocre at best. The shop inside is cute and I would consider trying a different location for their lunch. As far as any highlights of this location I will say that it is clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast sandwich on a croissant and iced coffee at drive thru. Sandwich tasted like it was dipped in grease and coffee was way too sweet. I had to take it home to sop up the grease with paper towels and brew myself some fresh coffee.   People tell me they love this place. This was my 3rd and final time trying to see what people are raving about."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite fresh and healthy place to eat any type occasion. They serves breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The place is really cleaned and cozy feelings vibes. It's pretty small cafe but modern hipster looking. The bread its has a fresh and good smell. I liked it how its so moist to taste it. I haven't tried any beverage beside latte and frappe but its too die for. My favorite is chocolate berry frappe"}
{"text":"The food is good, and I love their desserts! But they always get my order wrong. I end up having to turn around and go back to get it corrected. Super inconvenient!"}
{"text":"Kneaders has been in this location for awhile now. I finally looked them up. I wanted to try the French toast it looked amazing on the website. So today I came in ordered French toast. Wasn't to impressed kinda disappointed. Wish it had more flavor and not so plain I could have made it at home. 10 minutes went by and I am still waiting for just French toast. The girl walked out looks at me turned right back around and I can hear her ask them if they started the order. I then hear the guy say I didn't know there was anything.  So my French toast is finally done and the girl walks out and says my name taking the long way around trying to play it off. Sorry it didn't work because u looked straight at me knowing I didn't have my order and there was only 2 other groups that were in there. I don't know I will come back and try the lunch and see how it is."}
{"text":"So I recently came to kneaders and had a bad experience. However their awesome manager Jake made things right. I went back again and got a club sandwich and turkey cranberry sunflower salad and the food was great and it came out right away! I also Got a brownie and it was seriously the best brownie ever! It was really nice inside and they have a drive thru very big +."}
{"text":"I've been to Kneaders for dinner a few times and it was good but not something I crave so I haven't felt the desire to try the breakfast till today. So I went for the all you can eat French toast and I am sooooo glad I did, it was awesome!  All I can say is that I don't have to put up with Paradise Bakery's average at best and over priced breakfast anymore!"}
{"text":"Don't be in a hurry. Long slow ordering line, slow food service. Harried employees, though very pleasant. Too many better choices to come back here. Hire more people for goodness sake."}
{"text":"Walking in I had high hopes for this place, it looked cute and homey. We walked up to the register and I ordered a chicken salad on a croissant and my mom ordered a thai chicken salad. We got drinks as well and we always take our own cups with us because we try to use as little plastic as we can and the lady told us she couldn't put our drinks in them because of the department of health, and used Starbucks as an example saying they can't use them, which is not true. I work at Starbucks and we consistently put drinks in personal cups, which is why we sell them, we even have a cup discount. So she made a false accusation and had a terrible attitude with us the entire time. Then the food and drinks we not great. The salad was not thai at all, it had a basic vinaigrette, rubbery chicken, red peppers, and cashews. My sandwich was just fine, not a lot of flavor. Overall unhappy and treated poorly. All we got was a refund on one drink. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I just wish they had something glutton free that would taste as good as all their other stuff. I want to just sit down and cry  that I can't have dessert here!"}
{"text":"OK I have to admit I'm not been a fan of chain restaurants and when it opened up down the street from my house I had a lot of reservations on coming here.   Proud to say I was not disappointed in my meal tonight as we had the southwest barbecue sandwich with the combo and their cup of tortilla soup.  The bacon avocado salad was good as it had lettuce, slow-roasted turkey, bacon, avocado, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions & ranch dressing.  The meal comes with a bread of choice.   My only downside is that when in eating a salad , i can't really enjoy with plastic utensils. I need hardware to 'jab' through the ingredients to get a good mix on my fork.  If you have time, check out the mini trinkets and items (for sale) as they make some pretty cool gifts for friends. They also have a gift wrapping station so you can personalize.   Thy have a lot of pastries available but a little to pricy for my likings. Almost wish they had a sample day of different pastries instead of bread to help pick something out."}
{"text":"Food is ok, the service is extremely slow and they don't get your order right. I would not recommend this. Walk across the parking lot to Smash burger or Chipotle, much better service."}
{"text":"What a great place to it! I will be going here every chance I get! Great scratch made food and great staff. You won't regret coming here"}
{"text":"1st time here.  I pointed to the pic on the menu board with 1/2 salad, sandwich and charged full salad including brown wilted lettuce and a$14 tag to go with it.  Salad came with bread. Ordered focacia with salad and asiaho cheese bread for sandwich.  Didn't get either....  Listen better at McDonalds.... Their salad isn't wilted either. Pretty bummed."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and super tasty. They even have a rad breakfast menu. Would recommend stopping by if you're in this area."}
{"text":"Thank you Marcus! We had such a great experience today. The food was great and definitely a difference in quality from my last visit. My son had a turkey sandwich and I had the chicken salad and we both had potato soup. My son loved the soup and sandwich and wants to come back to have the club sandwich or as you called it \"The Dagwood\".  We really  appreciate the attentive service and the care you provided us today. Definitely, will be back to visit again."}
{"text":"I created this account for reasons like this; when exceptional services/food  is rendered I like to acknowledge it. First, the staff was beyond friendly and did a great job getting me and my family our food in a timely manner despite how crazy busy they were. There were workers going through the lobby doing an exceptional job of turning tables, restocking etc. all while going back and forth delivering the yummy food. ( I know how hard this can be especially during rushes working in the food industry myself) We needed a to go box/bag and right when I arrived at the counter to ask I was approached by 4 different people asking if I had been helped. Talk about service! It was awesome!! I also learned that I can call in and order my food or place the order online by the kind girl who was greeting people at the door! My lunch breaks are short so I love knowing that's an option.  The decor of the store is beautiful and I was quite surprised to find out everything is for sale!! Great for me not so much my wallet hahaha  The food....so delicious. I ordered a Chicken Rasperberry Nut Salad and about died at how large the salad was and it came with yummy fresh bread on the side. The Raspberry dressing was so good!!The pastrys...dangerous good for both sight seeing and to taste!! Truthfully you can't go wrong with any pastry from the looks of it. I had a chocolate dome and ended up ordering 2 more to go for my sister to try; she loves chocolate.  I love that everything is made from scratch and fresh. Overall my experience was an amazing one. I'm a person who appreciates good quality service and food and both those items where top notch here! I will definitely be back and won't hesitate to tell people to GET IN THIS PLACE, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Meh is all I can say about Kneaders. My aunt loves this place and thus so my mom and I decided to try it out. It wasn't busy at this location when we dined, so we took our time trying to figure out what to order. I got the aura of a wannabe Bob Evans [selling things] + smallish Panera [selling food].   The cashier tried to be helpful but he'd not eaten much off the menu so couldn't really tell us outside of the tuna sandwich what was good. I ended up getting the turkey artichoke panini. The flavors were good, but the turkey appeared to be overdone in spots - a couple of bites were a little more difficult to chew than others. My mom got the chicken salad [very uneventful, her words]. She really liked the croissant though! I got the combo since it came with 2 things of parmesan chips and a dessert [not sure why they have that odd of a combo]. We loved the chips! The key lime tart was decent. My mom was excited to get a dessert when we arrived, but after the disappointing meal, she just didn't feel like it. I think we'll just stick to other bakery-cafes."}
{"text":"We came for Saturday morning breakfast.  The restaurant is very clean and homey, great atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  But the food was awesome.  We got the cinnamon roll French toast which was good...but the Greek omelet!!  Wow!!!  My husband said it was one of the best omelettes he has ever had!!  We are trying to go as meatless as possible and two of the four omelettes didn't have meat.  The bread pudding was super good too!!  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by how fresh and delicious the food was. I can't wait to eat my way through more of the menu."}
{"text":"#hazelnutbread #desserts and a #fireplace      Food - avacado veggie sandwich and a coke $10.00  Current mood- yum in my tum!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast and it was really delicious! I had the pecan pancakes and he got the French toast. The portions are very generous and the caramel syrup is to die for! A nice bonus is the super cute store they have there. It kind of reminds me of a mini version of the gift shop inside a Cracker Barrel. What's not to love? We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders' salads! I always get the Thai chicken salad, the dressing is so good. No matter what location I go to, I know I'm getting quality, healthy food. This Tempe locations happens to be my favorite, the staff is always friendly and it's super convenient."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite lunch spots! Never fails. Best turkey bacon avocado sandwich around!"}
{"text":"The bread here is delicious. I enjoyed Kneaders before I went Vegan. Now that I am, it is a bit difficult finding things I can eat. Based on a previous review, I was able to concoct this Veggie Avocado Sandwich with cucumbers and cranberry sauce. It was delicious and filling. I wish there were more options available and that the things that are vegan/vegetarian friendly were more clearly marked. That's the only reason for the three stars."}
{"text":"Peyton the night manager was simply amazing. Gave amazing suggestions for everything and was probably the most helpful worker we've come across in a while."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in a Kneaders and I really enjoyed it! I got a cappuccino and french toast. The service both at the register and at the table was GREAT. I felt well taken care of, and that it was a place that encouraged repeat customers/regulars. The atmosphere was gorgeous, and I sat next to a burning fireplace. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry this morning, so thought I would go thru a drive thru for breakfast and having heard about Kneader's breakfast, I thought I would give it try.  I ordered the mexican omelet and it was delicious....as is all the other food items I have eaten at Kneader's.  It comes with their amazing whole wheat bread which? is always tasty.  The drive thru girl was charming and sweet and the whole experience was another good one.  Kneaders knows what they are doing....I suggest you try them if you haven't? already.  #LFTHX"}
{"text":"First time there and never going back. A friend and I went on our lunch break, since it is close to our office. I thought the interior was super cute, I definitely was not expecting them to sell trinkets and little home décor items. I ordered first and got the avocado sandwich and half berry salad. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time, but my friend got her food first. Ok, whatever. Then like 5 min later I get my food. As we get up to leave, bc we ordered to go, my friend noticed my half berry salad compared to her half berry salad. They had completely left out some of the berries, the feta cheese, and the candied almonds on hers. We ask for it to be fixed, since mine looked so much better, and like 10 minutes later it comes out again. Why would it take that long to re-do a salad, esp when you have a customer who complained and is waiting?? It was so frustrating. While we were waiting, I noticed that I did not get my side bread that was supposed to come with my salad or the chips that were supposed to come with my sandwich. So my friend's salad is messed up, and I don't get any of my sides. And when we came back to the office, my friend noticed they put the wrong meat in her sandwich. OMG. It's shame they don't have it together there because the salad was very good, but it's not worth the headache of dealing with everything else. Paradise Bakery, I will never cheat on you again."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this location and I was impressed with the service and the food on my first visit I decided to stop in again. On this visit I came in the late afternoon only to stand around longer than I should have by the cash register for someone to take my order. I finally ordered my cinnamon roll to-go and perused the odds and ins of the place plus I checked out the other baked goodies in the case. Just when I walked out I realized that I need a fork and napkin and to my surprise they put it in the bag.  My cinnamon roll was dry on the edges and wasn't very good at all.  I'll stick with the salad like on my first visit -probably a healthier option anyways. I will probably come back but this visit was just a meh to me."}
{"text":"We decided to go give their breakfast a try! Our cashier recommended the unlimited French toast. The servicing was generous and delicious! The only thing I would recommend is being able to add eggs as part of the complete breakfast combo! But overall, it was delicious! We will be back"}
{"text":"Where do I even start? So I work in the building next to this location and decided to try them out for lunch. I tried to place an order online for pick up but they didn't allow me to pay when I got there, which should have been my first clue not to go. I brushed it off and called at 11 for pick up at 12.   Now when I got there the line was literally out the door. I went up to the pick up window and waited...and waited...and waited some more. I walked up to the cashier at the main line and she told me she will have somebody come down. Nobody came until 12:18.   After telling the guy I was here for a pick up he had me pay for my stuff...which was a big mistake. My order wasn't even ready! So I still had to wait for them to make it. If I place an order a HOUR in advance it should be ready to go! I would have left but I already paid. I didn't walk out of there until 12:35. What made it even worse was the fact the cashier didn't say sorry for the wait or offered a drink or something. Just gave me my bag and said \"here you go\" and walked away. I made sure to let everybody in my department know about this. I will never waste my money on this place again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kneaders Bakery and to my surprise they had a drive thru. Very convenient when I don't want the hassle of getting the kids out and back in the car. My husband and I each got the turkey, bacon, avocado on focaccia. Sandwiches are huge and we could've easily shared but I'm ok because I have lunch tomorrow. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it! I'm glad there is a location close to our house in Chandler but this is perfect for my husband as it is very close to his work."}
{"text":"Q:  What did one slice of bread say to the other slice of bread when he saw some butter and jam on the table?  A:  We're toast!  Ah, Kneaders.  I do love the smell of freshly baked bread upon entering the establishment.  While I don't normally go out to get a sandwich and soup fix, I had been feeling an on-coming cold and needed me some comfort food last week.  So off to Kneaders we went!  I got a delicious Turkey Cranberry Croissant with a bowl of their Cream of Broccoli soup.  I really enjoyed my sandwich.  The meat was moist, it had just enough cranberry sauce, and the croissant was buttery and flaky.  It's was reminiscent of the day after Thanksgiving when you make a leftover abomination sandwich!  The soup though was a slight disappointment.  The Cream of Broccoli was watery and overcooked to the point of no return.  I get that the soup has to be left on burners but I think this one was set at a temperature much to high.  Eeks!  Anyways, they have a wide array of sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts, breads, and even kitschy home decor and aprons for you to purchase.  Stop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"First of all the bread is really delicious and the variety of bakery goods outstanding.   The turkey salad with greens and avacado is a great energy salad and the veggies  are fresh.  The soups however , particularly the broccoli taste like old Ca***bells from a tin can .. I ordered 2 nights in a row fairly close to closing time ( 840 and 835).   Both times the salads were perfect but the soup was watery and thin.  I informed the manager on duty and was informed that \" I made the soup, I know it's right\" to which I rebuted \" No , it's watery and thin. \".  Also the attitude of the cashier and support staff was apathetic and indifferent. They seemed more concerned with closing the front door at exactly 9 pm and sweeping us out the door.     I realize that the hours are long in retail...been there ...but for your own business sake please garner a better attitude toward your locals that live  within 500 feet of your store or you will lose clients ...you need dinner customers just as much as breakfast and lunch.    Later"}
{"text":"Good food and the company has great people working there. plus they take car of there employees!"}
{"text":"I loved this cute new spot. There's usually only one cashier who takes the orders so the wait can be long. But I loved the food and the bakery had such great selection. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Today the service was terrible. The cashier didn't listen to our order. When you spend $30+ dollars on sandwiches, you expect better. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I've have quite a few different sandwiches, salads, and pastries and they don't disappoint. I used the drive thru recently and it was super busy, taking a while for my order. The drive thru attendant thanked me for my patience, apologized, and he gave me a whole loaf of their seasonal orange cranberry bread as service recovery. I thought that was quite nice!"}
{"text":"Great food and product! I just don't understand why it takes so long for everything! I go through the drive thru, expect to be there at least 10 minutes. I've ordered a sandwich, smoothies, and coffee  Always takes that long  Currently sitting in the drive thru waiting for JUST a coffee. It's been 12 minutes since I got my receipt. And prob a few more minutes since I actually ordered.  Not sure I'll come back unless I have a lot of time to kill. I've given it like 5 chances, with no change"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place its right by my house and has healthy options however I've been disappointed both times. The last time I ordered a spinach salad with fruit and chicken. The fruit which by the way was about 5 pieces was moldy and had to be thrown out I was left with spinach and chicken that I could have made at home and not spent $8. You're better off going to Panera where you'll get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is soo good!! I had the tuna on Asiago bread and added cheddar with a side of their Parmesan kettle chips and their chocolate mousse dome. Every bite was delicious and perfect if you are in the mood for a tasty cafe style lunch. Very similar to paradise bakery to give you an idea. My 5 year old had a PB&J ( hold the J ) with milk and grapes and a cute fish shaped cookie and she loved it too! It came to about $18 for our meals which seems pretty reasonable for how good it was. I'm planning on going again in the morning with my kiddo for breakfast ( they apparently do all you can eat French toast ) would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hands Down THE BEST customer service experience that I've had in a long time. It's great to get a warm feeling when you go out to grab food with your family. The night manager Peyton had great personal skills and kept us smiling while we waited for our food. Not to mention, our large order came out in a timely fashion."}
