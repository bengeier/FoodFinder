{"text":"Family owned and operated, this place offers a more authentic Jamaican cuisine experience in Markham. Their Ackerman and salt fish, available on Fridays only, is excellent but call ahead to reserve your order because they sell out every week! Jerk chicken and pork, roti, patties, curry goat etc all reasonably tasty, rice and peas is a bit bland.  Typical Grace pop selection is also sold."}
{"text":"Great place to go Jerk Chicken. Friendly staff and service. This is regular place for takeout when I have the urge for some jerk.=]"}
{"text":"Been a few years since I visited.. has this place shut down?

Good memories of a patty on coa coa bread with goat curry all over.. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"This was my first visit for some take out here. I wasn't sure what i wanted so I asked for a recommendation from one of the two staff there. What I ended up with was a combo or jerk chicken and jerk pork with peas/rice/coleslaw sides.

The staff were friendly, atmosphere was simple but nice. My food was ready, packed, and paid for unbelievably quick. (In and out in less than 3 minutes it seemed).

The meat was obviously the best part and it was really good. Nice and spicy but friendly if you're sensitive to hot food. If you're a veteran for hot food make sure you get a hot sauce on the side (and that's crazy hot, I think a scotch bonnet type sauce). I had to knock stars off because the rice and peas tasted somewhat bland and this makes up the majority of the meal. 

Will i go back, yes! I'm trying the roti next."}
{"text":"I love the jerk pork and they have curry chicken(mild) OMG you have to try this food. Roti and a few other items. Very simple decor. Very clean."}
