{"text":"Always incredibly friendly baristas and accommodating . Drive thru has never taken too long & espresso quality is high. Love sitting outside as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff! They remember your name and drink orders and are always welcoming and friendly. They make great recommendations, and I've never Left dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I hate coffee, but I love tea. But, I like coffee flavored things. Explain that one to me.  CB&TL has a great tea selection & I would rather come here than SBUX any day. Also, a great place to meet any potential suitees in lieu of going on a date ;)   The staff is very nice, informative & helpful. They also keep this place fairly clean."}
{"text":"Good coffee, horrible service. I was the only one in the store and the young girl at the counter was abrasive and made me feel as she was doing men's favor by helping me. Every question short and no 'Thank you', 'please', 'my pleasure', at all. I would have been happier if she would have at least faked it. On top of that, they slam everything in the store (behind the counter) and make being in the store uncomfortable. Sad to say that you lost a customer because you tolerate a surly employee."}
{"text":"I can only review on the Red Velvet Cocoa. I never had it before today and all I can say is, \"Yummy!\""}
{"text":"Here's a recap from my visit to the coffee bean on Sahara: I had the tortilla soup and egg cheese potato burrito. Great service. Product placement good, but no pricing so you don't know how much these are including the salads and sandwiches. Soup was excellent and they microwaved it for me . Burrito was also very good. Nice packaging and even got salsa for my burrito. Overall experience \"A\". I would come back again   Soup, salad and sandwiches see to be a new addition and a welcome one."}
{"text":"I love coffee bean and this is my fav location.  I go everyday before work and there so friendly they know my drink by heart VERY friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love this place!  They know my drink and my name!!  (7 shot 33 oz  Americana with hazelnut/sugar free vanilla with no no water over ice!)   I know it sounds intense (and it is) but the taste of their coffee is like no other - better than any coffee house I've ever been to anywhere, so far.  Plus the prices are reasonable.  They even offer a coffee card for $25 dollars with a free drink.  The Barista's are always friendly and get your drink out A.S.A.P.   As an committed ex-Starbucker - I have found my new coffee home and will never look back again..."}
{"text":"Very friendly and sweet staff. They are dog friendly with treats for drive thru buddies. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee bean location. Love the outside patio area that has lounge type chairs, the staff is always really nice except to youngest blonde named Kitty I think ( this is a hint to extremely nice store manager to work with that girl and teach her to smile). Other than that everybody else is super nice and helpful , location is always clean and neat and coffee beverages are ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"I'm a 2 year several days a week loyal customer of COFFEE BEAN AND TEA on SAHARA @ FORT APACHE, in Las Vegas. I usually order my FAV iced coffee,  the \"Iced Carmel Latte\" with almond milk and at times I extra shot it. It's a must to get 24 or 32 oz. Because if your going to treat yourself you should always go big or well you know. Today Mimi (one awesome girl) handed me a new iced coffee to try along with my order. I had to jump on here and give a shout out and review this sweet tropical tasting little treat of paradise. If your a coffee fanatic as I this coffee drink gives you that summer iced tropical coconut burst with the sweet dipped taste of the Carmel drizzle. It's refreshing with that light back taste of coffee, if you want more of that coffee taste with that tropical indulgence ask for that extra shot. Thanks Mimi, and all the crew at SAHARA Coffee Bean and Tea! You're all awesome! !!"}
{"text":"Great Service.... I usually go to the location closest to my house but today I went out of my way to this location & the 2 girls that were working were absolutely Great & Super freindly... This location is now my go to!!!"}
{"text":"I came in here around 9am, and it wasn't that busy, yet service seemed so absent minded. The 2 staffers were nice enough, but the place was messy and dirty. It seems like the drive-thru took all their attention. I suppose it would help if an extra person was there, but it seemed like there was a great lack of communication and teamwork between the coworkers. I would hate to see what it's like here when it gets busier, because just average foot traffic was too much for them too handle. I don't see myself coming back here, even with a coupon that they gave me."}
{"text":"Ok honestly, I work at Starbucks and get discounts at Starbucks when I'm not working but I still choose to come to coffee bean & tea leaf. I'm not a coffee person but I am a huge tea drinker!! The amount of tea latte options they have is awesome. Hot tea lattes, iced tea lattes- they are all great! Starbucks just doesn't have the amount of tea options they have here. It's a shame coffee bean & tea leaf aren't as \"popular\" or \"trendy\" as Starbucks....but that's ok- more for me! Love this location because of its drive thru. The baristas here are so friendly to me even though I work for the other guy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months now and I'm loving it. The staff is amazing, always upbeat and perky even when I am half awake at 6am. I get a cappuccino with two raw sugars and 2% milk. Josh always makes my drink perfect. Thank you for the consistently great service!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO excited this opened...it along with Jamba juice took over this long over due \"used to be\" McDonalds building. It has a drive thru and I don't have much to say (because thats how i patronized this place) other than the green tea is delicious. Be back for a more exciting review when I try other things!"}
{"text":"The Bagels are inedible, I asked for more cream cheese to try to choke it down, I had to buy more ... Ok.... Then had to re wait in line to pay for it.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"What a lovely spacious Coffee and Tea house! Great location and A large patio area! My favorite is the Hazlenut Ice blend topped with whip! The wait was short..Service good..And beautiful art displayed!"}
{"text":"I have one word for you. PEET'S COFFEE IS THE BEST COFFEE IN TOWN. End of story. Somehow a 24 oz cup at this coffee bean was smaller than a 20 oz cup from Peet's. Huh? The staff are friendly and service is quick, which is why the 2 stars. But after getting iced drinks at Peet's I realized what a jack this CB is. All the iced drinks are 3/4 ice and 1/4 coffee drink. It's cold but a $6 latte should last longer than 4 small sips. At Peet's they put just enough ice in to cool it but still give you your $$ worth. And the quality of coffee is so much better at Peet's it's ridic. I tried a croissant at CB once and it tasted like it was 3 days old and possibly used as a soccer ball during slow times of day. By comparison a chocolate croissant at Peet's was flaky, warm, delish, tasting like it came from a gourmet French bakery. CB charges gourmet prices for ghetto products. The only place CB may be better than is Dunkin Donuts, which is a pretty low bar. And somebody needs to inform CB corporate that the up-sell at the drive through is super obnoxious. When I say I just want a drink and that's all, stop asking if I also wouldn't like a sandwich or banana or salad with my coffee. I don't leave my house not knowing what I want at all, somehow end up at a CB dt and then figure it out with their help. Annoying the crap out of the customers isn't good service, it's completely disingenuous and not authentic. It makes me want to throw my coffee at the person handing it to me at the window. Good riddance to crappy coffee and excessive customer service. At Peet's they're genuinely friendly, the coffee is bomb, and they give me what I ask for, no more and no less. I wish they would demolish this location and build a Peet's. Did I mention Peet's is the best?;-)"}
{"text":"Honestly the coffee is really smooth- never tastes burnt and it never is too harsh or watered down. The cream they use is great and their ice blends are amazing!   Also their tea is really good also! I enjoy this place more than a lot of the other coffee places~"}
{"text":"Make sure when you buy your drink that they not going to add hot water for the expensive price that you pay for your drink you deserve to get it right."}
{"text":"Good prices over Starbucks and their hazelnut iced coffee is my fav! Staff here is always super nice and the drive thru doesn't take hours to have your coffee ready."}
{"text":"It was alright. It has a cool bar to charge your laptop. The gluten free carrot muffin is pretty good."}
{"text":"I always receive the best customer service and promptness from this location! Not to mention the drinks here are consistent in taste and quality every time I order, which is huge when working in the food and beverage industry! I just wish they were open later everyday"}
{"text":"The staff is always awesome but they keep messing up my coffee. Once they didn't give me the right flavor, another time they made my coffee with burnt beans. How can you have a burnt bean flavored coffee?! I didn't understand that. Twice is enough for me not to return. Sorry CB&T."}
{"text":"This is the newer coffee bean Ive been wanting to try for a while but just havent had the time to get to since I'm an avid starbucks drinker. Why? Because of the fact that starbucks has a rewards program. Thats def something that Coffee Bean needs to get.   I actually like their coffee better AND prices.   Didnt like that when I came in the cashier was taking the orders of two ladies at the front and then afterward continued to chit chat with them. Excuse me but i was waiting in line. I do understand they are regulars and your friends, blah blah blah but when theres another person waiting it should be common sense to be nice but keep it short. Annoyed me but whatever.  Coffee was delicious like I remember. Got the carmel coffee with a plain bagel and cream cheese to snack along with it. Can't say no to carbs and dairy, especially when they are packed together,"}
{"text":"The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is my favorite coffee chain of all time! The staff here are very friendly for the most part. For some reason though, just at this particular location my drink orders always feel very watered down. It has deterred me from coming to this specific franchise, honestly. I will say, during my most recent last visit, I actually turned around to let them know it felt watery (which I normally don't do), and the woman at the drive through was SO kind and accomodating! Maybe it's just me and the drink I get specifically, which is the Iced Cherry Blossom Tea Latte."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this location probably 3 times a week. I go strictly for winter dream tea. Every time we go the girls are friendly and  fast. Their croissants are really inconsistent tho sometimes they are hard and othere times they are perfect..  They have gotten really slow my croissant is almost always not warmed or burnt i will no be coming here."}
{"text":"Large iced mocha extra shot is all I ever get. Pricey, but tasty.  When the weather's nice, it's great sitting out on the patio area. There's also a gas fire box & ceiling fans.  Free WiFi is also nice."}
{"text":"I love this Coffee Bean! The service is always fast and friendly and I have never had a bad experience there!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever ordering food from here and I'm a bit disappointed. I ordered a burrito and when I unwrapped it one whole side of the tortilla was stuck to the paper. So as I peeled the paper off, the tortilla came with it."}
{"text":"Terrible macchiato and not able to use my gift certificate. Not happy with my order. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I really love this location! I'm shocked at the review that staff are not friendly. They are extremely pleasant and have a passion for what they do. Every time I come through the drive through they are full of energy. Has my order been messed up? Yes, but they are quick to make it right. I  enjoy grabbing my coffee here most mornings."}
{"text":"JJ suggested I get the Jasmine peach tea on ice so I did and I enjoyed it but was sad that he put too much ice. 24 Oz cup was a 16oz drink basically."}
{"text":"I've been to many coffee bean locations, and this one really stands out! The staff is so friendly! We went the first day when we were visiting Las Vegas, and the customer service was excellent. When we went back again, the staff remembered us and Sven called me by name. The general manager is so so friendly and nice! They have high chairs and a changing table in the bathroom, too! I wish I could transport this location to Los Angeles !"}
{"text":"Aleita, Lauren and company are great! They are friendly and very nice to interact in ordering. The coffees and teas are made in a timely manner and in my case done right. Definitely a nice coffee shop to visit."}
{"text":"I have visited this location twice. The employees are always friendly and my drinks always come out great!  I had a coupon for a free drink once and the barista gave me the largest one I could get. It was nice of him to recommend it."}
{"text":"Love the comfy chairs while uploading recent real estate videos to YouTube.  Have you ever tried their Kevita drink? My first time & it's GREAT!!  They have a nice outside patio w/ a fire pit for when the cooler temps come around.  I would have given them a 5 star if it wasn't for the brash treatment that was given from the apparent manager to what I believe was a new employee when she needed help with someone else's order.  1st time here....I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to really like CBTL, so I was happy to get a gift card from a customer. I usually go to the Lake Mead location, which I prefer.  I was disappointed with my coffee and the service today at the location at The Lakes. I ordered a medium light roast in a large cup so I would have room for milk. Without telling me, the barista charged me for a large. Not a big deal, but I think it's shady to charge someone more without telling them. My coffee was also burnt tasting, but after my poor service from Aleita, I didn't feel like saying anything. That coffee tasted like it was several hours old, at least. Might as well have gotten it from a gas station.   Once my gift card balance is gone, I'm not likely to return. Definitely not to this location. On the plus side, CBTL has great ice blendeds and good pastries."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf even though I have been an aficionado of the brand. They have gotten my order wrong, and have not been the most friendly. They gave me a large tea that was very weak, as it had only 1 tea bag. Everyone who drinks tea at these establishments (and who serve them) knows that you must put 2 tea bags in a large tea or else you are just drinking flavored water.  And the other CBTs do put in 2 bags.  Well, the last couple times I went to THIS one, they put in 1 tea bag, so it was pretty watery. I asked about it, and the snotty girl said I had to pay \"extra\" for another tea bag. Well, that's the first I had heard of it. Also, it makes no sense. Tea is basically water. We are already paying MORE for a large tea--if it does not come with the additional tea bag, what are you paying for?"}
{"text":"One star because Im hoping to get the attention of someone at the Coffee Bean!! Question: WHY DO THE COFFEE BEAN & TEA LEAF MANAGERS SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN ASK TO OFFER 'heavy cream' ????  THEIR COFFEE IS TERRIFIC, this refusal to hear a customers request is a -1star.  I have discussed this with other 'would be'  COFFEE BEAN  Patrons who also say they are told 'not permitted to order heavy cream from their distributor'  Or 'I dont know, but we are unable to carry heavy cream'  Neglectful customer service and Just doesnt make sense in general!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! They multi task the drive thru window and inside customer flow very efficiently. I had a wonderful time sipping my drink and conducting a quick business meeting in their comfortable lounge."}
{"text":"I'm big on customer service and this location was lacking any customer service. I was not greeted when walking up to the counter by the 2 workers behind the counter. One was making drinks and the taking orders at the drive thru. When I was greeted by the drive thru person she said \"we'll be right with you\" but I stood there for another couple minutes until someone came out from the back and said \"have you been helped?\" (In a not so enthusiastic voice) when I finally got my drink it was given by the barista who also had no enthusiasm for being there or serving. On top of it all my drink was too sweet. I will not be going back to this location. They could learn a thing or two about service from Starbucks. It also was not busy. There was only one other person who ordered a drink before me (in the store)"}
{"text":"Have to give it an A-OK because I just grabbed a Latte so don't know better or worse except better than Starbucks but not as good as Illy !"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for all things cool and refreshing! I love this Coffee Bean location. Alieta, Nessa, Alex, and Amanda are my girls that always brighten my day and if I miss a day coming thru the drive thru they know it....they always have a beautiful smile on their faces and a kind word for all. You should treat yourself and pay this location a visit! I love you Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for my mocha latte every day for 3 years, passing by 2 other coffee houses that start with the letter S - - I'm a coffee snob plus I like going to places where they know my name. The espresso is robust, the employees are super duper friendly and I love how you can get a free drink when you put $30 on a gift card. So many reasons to love this coffee bean. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I do have to say that I absolutely LOVE this Coffee Bean! The staff is beyond friendly, the facility is very spacious and clean, the drinks are delicious and consistent with the CB quality we've all come to know and love and the WiFi is rock solid. As this is the newest Coffee Bean in the valley, some have complained about the intermittent WiFi, but I can tell you that whatever problems they may have had initially, have been resolved. The speed tests I've conducted from my laptop over the past several trips here have hit an impressive average of 10-13 Mbps (download) and 1-2 Mbps (upload), even while others were sharing the bandwidth as well.   Being the new kid in town, this Coffee Bean is relatively mellow for now (which is good for those of you in school who like to study at coffee shops ;)), but something tells me that once people discover this hidden gem in The Lakes, it'll become a favorite spot for all to share."}
{"text":"This is my usual spot to get a coffee. Great location, staff is super friendly. Amazing coffee. I'd say that a Coffee bean staff make better coffee nowadays than many popular coffee shops. The place has its owning parking that you can use if you plan to stay for more than 20 mins. It also has great table on which to study, which I always do. One little remark however that it gets too cold inside sometimes, even if the weather is 80 degrees outside. Hence, my recommendation is: \"grab a jacket or a hoodie, when you go there and plan to study\". Would go there again."}
{"text":"They severed me a piece of coffee cake that was seriously like a brick when I asked for a fresh one they said they'd heat it up for me. Seriously?! And this was after the guy made such a fuss about me asking for black forest with no espresso beans. I used to really like this place but it's really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Back at coffee bean.  Yea Aleita is still manager.  I love my iced tea lemonade & Anthony is making do with water.  It is actually very nice in the patio."}
{"text":"I love the Coffee Bean. They have the best mocha frap type drinks with extra shots of expression lol. This Coffee Bean is always professional, and makes the experience really quick. They multitask like pros. That's why I recommend them to everyone.  Thanks, Josh"}
{"text":"Great staff and best made drink. So far, this is my favorite coffee joint. Very good Ice blended coffee. Definitely recommend this location to everyone."}
{"text":"My regular stop for an afternoon break. Cat's staff is very friendly and helpful. And they even gave me a complimentary drink to make up for a mistake in my order.  Great service, and I love that they remember my favorite drink."}
{"text":"Consistent friendly service and quality products!  Clean facility.  My favorite cold drink is Jasmine dragon tea latte iced."}
{"text":"Ideal spot for meetings or connecting with friends. The service is great, there is a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, and the menu is excellent. Easily one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean environment and excellent service. The manager is the best. She always at knowledge of my favorite drink and call  me by name. I love their hazelnut ice blended drink. It's always a pleasure visiting this place. Location is excellent, plenty of parking spaces."}
{"text":"COFFEE BEAN, Sahara  A brand NEW, EXTRA SPACIOUS Coffee Bean with great service; inviting seating areas inside and outside!  - If you like Coffee Bean, you'll love this particular one!  YELPIER DETAILS: - One afternoon, I was actually heading for Starbucks on Sahara and Fort Apachi, but the way to Starbucks was blocked and I was forced to make a left turn in the parking lot, and was totally surprised to spot a brand new Coffee Bean, with people sitting in its huge, attractive, covered patio with high ceilings and ceiling fans! I ventured in and was cheerfully greeted by the barista! I really loved this place with its bright, spacious, comfortable setup! The lounge has huge pic windows looking out into its gorgeous patio and streets!  More importantly, its staff here was exceptionally friendly and cheerful! One of the staff even offered to carry the order of an elderly customer to his table! Good training! The young lady manager was also busily helping out and greeting customers around her, making customers feel welcome! I like that in a boss! The drinks and food items were up to normal standards, as expected!  - The main door to the restrooms was tastefully \"hidden\" behind a wall paper! The men's room was large, equipped with no touch forcet, and kept super clean!  I really love this place and will start coming here more often! Give it a try, you'll like it!  Peterskis, Oct 2012 ---"}
{"text":"The two women working this morning were very polite and acknowledged me when I got there but...they were short staffed for so early in the morning and didn't care that everyone could hear them complaining to each other that they were both overwhelmed.  I came because there's good seating here and it gives me room to do work. But I didn't care for my drink.   I love cappuccinos and I love the red velvet hot chocolate but I don't know what happened back there during this \"rush\" but it wasn't good.  I've worked in a coffee shop before and it didn't seem like something you could mess up, but it is what it is.  At least I had coffee before work today. I love the coffee bean maybe next time my experience will be a little better."}
{"text":"I went to this place the other day. I felt like an having an iced tea. They must have had fifteen kinds of tea: Black teas, herbal teas, tropical blend, etc. I asked the girl behind the counter, to choose one for me. However, I chose my doughnut, myself.  Very good and not very expensive. The only problem is, that if your inside, the constant use of the blender can be quite annoying. There's a small patio outside, which isn't as loud, but when it's 100+ degrees out, then I'm not too keen about sitting outside. So, there you have it..."}
{"text":"The coffees and frozen drinks are very good. The yogurt was premade, so the granola was mushy."}
{"text":"Wide-open and spacious environment with ample indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor seating lacks power outlets in most areas. The store is clean and the service is prompt and friendly. Bring a book and settle or meet a friend over a cup."}
{"text":"I am biased because I am a coffee bean loyal customer, but I don't like bad service and that's something I've never received at this location.   I must say their drive thru line seems to always move quickly and efficiently.   Once in the drive thru they took a little extra time with the couple of cars in front of me (which really didn't seem like a long time) and they apologized for the wait and gave me a coupon for a free drink of my choice on my next visit!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the wonderful honest staff. My husband left his bag outside with his kindle etc... I called hours later and they had stepped outside where we were sitting to put the bag in the back when they realized we left without it. I couldn't thank them enough! The reason we come here is for the wonderful pastries (they're the only coffee bean that carries some of the same ones we used to get in California) and of course the coffee and tea is MUCH better than the \"other\" franchise. I told them how much I love a certain pastry and they ordered it for me. I just love this staff!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious coffee in town! I love the coffee and employees here! All the employees are friendly and seem to never have a bad day =D and i highly recommend ice hazelnut latte here"}
{"text":"I love this location. The GM Miss Hayes is so sweet! The coffee is always perfect and the food is always spot on  thanks for being my go to place in summerlin"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in Las Vegas. Amanda is the best!!! She greets you everyday with her happy face!! My drink is always made to perfection!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to this location!! The staff is extremely sweet and super polite!!"}
{"text":"There's a black girl who works the drive-through area now. She always remembers our order (it's a complicated order) and makes it perfect every single time! I love this lady, I'm glad she's working the drive through. She has so much personality and is always friendly and on point! I absolutely love the service I receive here. :)"}
{"text":"Personally, I think The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is one of the better coffee franchises out there. Their coffees taste better and their chai tea is pretty good. I even like their blended drinks better. The last time I was there, I had this rocky road drink that was ridiculously sweet and delicious. My sister had this caramel blended drink that she liked better than Starbucks'. In her words, \"this ACTUALLY tastes like caramel!\"  This particular location is really nice and comfy. They have a couple of couches and free wifi. Overall, I'd prefer to stop by here first than to stop by Starbucks."}
{"text":"On the scale of coffee chains I prefer coffee bean to starbucks but less than dunkin donuts. I was stoked when this location opened, but that quickly soured.  The wifi is awful and the place is overrun with parents and kids. The parents are fine, but the kids are usually small and loud. It's Summerlin and I'm used to it, but I don't like it.  The wifi was both slow and not capable of working with my chrome browser. That's unacceptable and I won't return any time soon...which is a shame.  The outdoor seating and club chairs inside are very comfortable. Rather than deal with kids and non-working wifi I'll take my coffee work time elsewhere. There are coffee joints every 10 seconds you drive around here."}
{"text":"How to say Good Sunday Morning? Begin the day with 2 Café lattes to go.  One for you and one for a friend. Don't have a designated friend?  Buy the second one and surprise someone with something tasty.  Generosity is great 365 days in a year. I appreciate the service and selection. I am interested in the Happy Hour and shared this as a Tip. Thank you for kind service Kat McDonald, manager."}
{"text":"Rude. Tried them a few times. They act like they are doing me a favor whenever I order there."}
{"text":"* There is a seating area outside but I would        recommend to stay inside during hot days. * I really like the atmosphere inside. * The people are very friendly and work fast as hell! * The price is normal and similar to others. * Always clean and great service! *Totally recommend the new Salt Caramel Latte & Ice Blended. *Watch out it's seasonal, get it soon!  \"Salty and sweet come together for fall. This rich, balanced flavor is garnished with caramel syrup and topped with a salted caramel crunch. This delectable beverage is sure to be a coffee lover's dream.\" - The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf"}
