{"text":"great and tasty jerk chicken, decent portion size."}
{"text":"If you want angry service come here. The portions are small and the food is not as tasty as the place down the street. Try not to annoy the women who work here by, heaven forbid, actually ordering something!"}
{"text":"This restaurant truly is a delight, even if you are not a king. The portions that the nice lady here serves her customers are very generous,truly a meal fit for a king. The amount you get is unbelievable especially when you factor in the low price ($5.00), I cannot believe this place is able to charge a low rate and stay in business, nor can I think of many places that I can get a big meal with practically every food group that will fill me up for a  low price. The flavour alone is enough to keep me as a customer, the other pluses about this place are a bonus. The coleslaw to begin with is sweet but just enough to compliment the flavours of the main attraction. I chose curry goat, as it is my go to when dining in a caribbean restaurant.The curry goat was well seasoned, juicy and meaty. The combination of the juices from the meat with the rice and deliciously sweet coleslaw makes for an unbelievable flavour combo in your mouth. The only let down with  this restaurant will be if  you where a customer of Mitchies eatery, because unlike Mitchies this restaurant  doesn't have french fries with spicy gravy. However that is the only thing they do not have. To be fair this place loses one star not based on quality, quantity or service. It loses a star for not having the fries. A product I grew up having pretty much every lunch period in grades 7&8, so based on nostalgia or lack of I deducted one star."}
{"text":"Chance up on this place when I was in the area and looking for a quick bite. This area is a big ghetto to be honest but you can tell the folks here work hard to make an honest living.

There were a few jerk places in the area but I was lured in by the signs outside for $5 jerk. Though the place is of a decent size, there's really no place to sit for your meal. It's as clean as I would imagine any place here can be and the lovely lady behind the counter was very welcoming.

On to the food. The jerk was seasoned well therefore had excellent flavours. Only downfall was the chicken was a little dry-- quite dry in some areas. Maybe it was sitting in the warmer for too long (I was visiting at an odd time in the afternoon). Chicken aside, the rice was fantastic and the coleslaw was a bit on the sweeter side (typical). 

All in all for $5 you can't really go wrong. I would say the jerk is pretty good and it's a satisfying meal but don't go out your way to visit."}
{"text":"I was working in the neighbourhood and we were recommended this place for jerk chicken.

For $5, we received a styrofoam box filled with rice n' peas, coleslaw and jerk chicken (a thigh and drumstick).
Plenty of food given! It was simply delicious and not too spicy. She was very generous with the gravy.
I noticed their Tuesday special is only $2.50 for the same thing. What a deal!

The service was great, she was very sweet and friendly. Love it and will be back.

Tip: It's a take out only place. There is no seating in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just went back to Kings Delight and have to say everything looks the same, ambient vibe and still no seating. So today I went in cause apparently Mother Nature hasn't made up her mind whether it's still winter or spring. Decided today wasn't a day to venture off to anywhere else and was feeling less motivated cause of the weather. Let me tell you, I went in and got a medium size portion and it was filled to the brim. The chicken pieces was so good and the rice pretty much full that the container couldn't be contained (lid closed).

Attached is rice and peas, fried chicken with coleslaw (sweet) $8.00.

They have other sizing from $3, $5, $8, and I believe $10?
They still carry other flavourful food like oxtail, curry goat. Still no Roti since the last time I went."}
