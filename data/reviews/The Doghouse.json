{"text":"chicago hot dogs are GREAT and now i can find them right around the corner.. such a treat!  these are the real deal and just about every i have gone, the people working there are are almost as excited as i am about them! prepare yourself for a poppyseed bun, and tons of toppings that fall on the floor as you try to eat it.  -like a salad on a bun!  ask them to make a veggie version for you and it is not a problem.. if you are in the mood for an all beef version or kosher dog, this is your place.   recently, co-workers and i generated a long list of hot dogs that we wanted to order for lunch, all of them different of course.  i called the order in and about $50 dollars worth of hot dogs were ready and waiting for me, labeled and organized so everyone would be happy and there was only one person working there that day!   such a treat! help to keep this place open and year round!!!"}
{"text":"The inside is nothing special -- in fact it's rather dingy and a bit unkempt. HOWEVER : look past the appearance and you'll find the best-tasting dog around!  The guy working there (not sure if he's the owner) was the cutest, sweetest man who was very vibrant and obviously loved his place. My mouth is watering thinking about the juicy hot dog, the warm, soft bun, the tangy sauerkraut, and the creamy brown mustard. MMMMM! According to my hub, the corn dogs were also \"rereeegooooo\" (that's \"really good\" with a mouth too busy eating to respond).  Great fries, too; they kind of remind me of the Burger King fries from back in the day, but bigger. (Not sure if BK has changed their fries, but it's been a minute since I've graced them with my presence.)  I would HIGHLY recommend the Doghouse to anyone craving a beef dog, turkey dog, veggie dog (nah) or polish dog with all the fixin's!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome...did agree with a previous poster about inside the restaurant...definitely nothing special and some kind of WOW factor but the food was delicious!  Had the italian sausage meal.  Nice little crunch to the sausage (which I like) and it very flavorful.  I love the fries, sooooo good! lol...the only reason why I stated that it is not good for groups is because the place is kind of small and there are not a lot of seats (maybe like five or six stools along the wall) but the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"The Chicago Dog is awesome! I'm glad this place is right down the street from me because I'll be heading back for sure. If you have a taste for a dog any way you like it, you should check this place out too."}
{"text":"I gave the Doghouse in Cleveland Heights a 1 star for not having sauted onions for a proper Maxwell St. Polish. In hindsight I appreciate the Doghouses efforts, it's nice to have a Chicago dog around even if it doesn't compare in quality to joints in other places. Using a Vienna beef or a higher quality dog would go a long way.   Avoid the $1 Monday dog special. I ordered two dogs, and one was a really funky greenish color (tossed it in the trash). These $1 dogs are coming from a lower quality stash/different brand then their normal dogs."}
{"text":"So, you know how you keep meaning to go to such and such a place and then finally you do and you taste like THE yummiest food and you're really really REALLY ticked off that it took you so damn long to go to this cool place because it's so, I dunno, FREAKING GREAT!!!!  Well, Yelpifiers, that was my experience today. Was tooling around on the chopper and decided to finally get my tush to The Doghouse. I explained to the really nice man (Larry, the owner) that I don't get a chance to get to that part of town often so what would he suggest out of his 2,500 (or so it seemed) items. He said, \"The Italian Beef Sandwich.\" I found that very interesting because I've always wanted one but never had been anywhere that made them. So that's what I had and holy cow, that was one of THE best damn sandwiches I've had, period.  If you don't know what it is, look it up then go get one. Send me thanks.   OK, so I finished that at the speed of light (which, I just heard, is NOT the fasted thing in the universe.  Methinks Mr. Einstein has some 'splaining' to do). I was still hungry and decided to go with his second suggestion (and, apparently, a Yelp favorite), the Chicago Dog.  Wow, wow, wow. Not as compelling or detailed a review of said item as can be found here by others, but let me just say it's simply THE best hot dog I ever had. THE best. I want another. I shall have another. Soon. As a matter of fact, since the Lakewood location is closed Sunday's I a going to take a spin to their location near Coventry on Euclid Heights Blvd.   Look, in all seriousness, these small family-owned and run places are a large part of what makes our city so damn great (you listening, CHAD!!??), so do yourself a great favor and go patronize The Doghouse.  I may not live anywhere near Lakewood or Coventry, but I'm going to make it a point to visit one location or the other as often as I can.  Oh--meant to add that although I did not order fries today the gentleman let me try one regular and one (one, not an order) sweet potato fry. They were absolutely perfect. The sweet potato fry was especially impressive because most (all?) places just don't make them all that well. This one was quite literally done to perfection. GET SOME!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and enjoyed the result very much.  It's a small take out place tucked in next to Chipotle on the Corner of Warren and Detroit.  NIce sized all Beef dogs are steamed then char grilled and dressed with a variety of toppings.  Lots of topping combinations to choose from (mostly named after cities the Chicago, the Cincinnati, etc.).  I went with the Southern Living (Kraut, Cheese, Brown Mustard, and Bacon) and the Polish Boy (foot long dog, Coleslaw, Fries and BBQ sauce) which were both excellent.  The fries were crispy, and just so-so, but I'll be back for more dogs in the future for sure."}
