{"text":"Newly renovated | lacking service | food quality lacking | dim sum

Review based on weekday dim sum only.

Dim sum Monday to Friday 11am - 3:30pm
Weekend 10am-3:30pm.

No special price (S, M, L, XL, SP, J, SJ) range from $4 per plate to $13.

Some dishes were ok some were horrible. Had the fishball soup noodle for $17.80 and there was barely and soup and the fishball seemed like it turned bad. I came with 7 people and we all spit it back out.

There were only 2 servers so we barely got service. 

I rated the previous restaurant at this location a 1 star. I was hoping this place would deserve a bit more. Unfortunately it only has the looks. I hope to try the dinner and see if they are more deserving."}
{"text":"Calling themselves \"Amazing\" is really stretching it. I mean, their food isn't terrible but for the price you're paying, you actually expect more. 

I only had their dim sum but I think that's enough for me to decide to never come back. It's your typical dim sum with fancy things thrown on top hence the price markup. Totally not worth it, IMO. Service was alright, the layout of the restaurant was a little awkward (very lengthy)."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Chinese, it's time to learn, cause most of the menu has no translation. Some of the items are really expensive, some are really good value. Very tricky tricky Just to start people off, for dim sum, they offer combo A, B and/ C. The combos are basically a mix platter of typical dim sum food. Great for two people to get a variety of dim sum, or for the dim sum nubs to try multiple things in one go. For lunch, lunch combo A, B or C is good. Each combo has main, congee and three side dish. A is fish, B is crab and C is lobster. D seems over priced unless you really want to eat that type of fish. And they say it's for 2 people, realistically, I would say 3 people really. Finally, for dinner, go for ?combo, three side dish, lobster, fried oyster and chicken. Right now for grand opening they are giving away fried squab for order over $50 after 5:30. Can definitely feed more than the 4 people they recommend. 

If you come here, think dim sum earlier in the day. Lunch and night would be Chinese seafood combo."}
{"text":"An upscale Cantonese restaurant in Markham.   Amazing service with delicious food.   Not your typical seafood restaurant.  They have lots of special dishes you won't find elsewhere.   Their GM, Joey, is awesome.  Come try this restaurant for dim sum or dinner.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is only for the special \"pencai\" (mixed food in a pot) I ordered based on the information on their poster.  I had dinner at this restaurant twice and both were good. I was told that this dish from T&T did not look anything like what they advertised for. So I was prepared that what I would get would look different but I was still positive that this should be better than a grocery's based on the two dinner experience. When I picked it up it was wrapped in foil. After I got home I opened it. It didn't look too bad. I wish they told me that the pot is a steamer. I thought the food went along the way from the bottom of the pot so I only used low heat to warm it up, which took some time. After we dig in, we were all very disappointed and didn't enjoy it at all. The dried abalone was okay and the taro was acceptable. All other ingredients were of bad quality. There were lots of cabbages and lotus roots. The bbq pork was hard. The bbq duck had lots of bones and very little meat. The taste wasn't good either. Most of the ingredients were not fresh!!

Conclusion: I will not buy this dish from anywhere anymore. It won't be good."}
{"text":"Very good overall, good service as well.
Will definitely go back.
The steamed fishes were excellent, cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Despite sharing the restaurants with a very loud Chinese gala dinner. Despite being barred from the bathroom because some lady decided to change in the sink area and not a stall. Despite awkwardly walking through people singing and dancing to get to our little area of the eatery. I am fully impressed by my first, and definitely not last, visit to Amazing Seafood House. 

Any one of those things could have made it a very annoying dinner experience but wow. Just wow. No small feat by the kitchen and wait staff who were phenomenal and the definition of professional. The 2 ladies managing our small section of walk-in customers were chatty and friendly, while keeping food and dishes moving at a non-stop pace. They served our food faster than at a restaurant that ISN'T hosting an event taking up the other 90% of the space. 

The food itself ranged from pretty good to crazy good. The steamed grouper was the highlight. I've eaten countless versions of it at countless Chinese restaurants, but none came close to this. It made my parents reminisce on the fish they used to eat in HK. The meat was firm and the fish had a freshness that is hard to find in fish sold inland. 

Another highlight was the pork bun. Traditionally more of a dim sum dish, but our waitress recommended we had to get it. Sure we had to wait a bit longer for it, but damn, I'm glad we waited. The bun was soft and sweet and the filling was chunky bits of savoury pork and seafood. Dessert was sweet almond paste with almonds that were grinded by the chefs themselves. 

While the food is on the pricier end, the total for 6 people came out to under $250, which is extremely reasonable. You might also get treated by surprisingly good deals, like the outstanding chicken soup we got for $18 when it regularly costs $68. Dim sum specials run every morning if you go before a certain time. 

Chinese banquet halls often name themselves with either a literal English pronunciation of their Chinese name OR they use some generic positive descriptor like \"Glorious, Diamond, Premiere\". Well Amazing Seafood House has earned the right to call itself that. Amazing food, amazing people. Call me amazed!

{"text":"Ok Amazing Seafood house really is pretty amazing, the food is very good, the lobsters are good (but most seafood specialty restaurants do a good job on this)  Every dish there is delicious. I have only been here twice since they opened but I would definitely come back for lunch and dinner.

They need to make an English menu, and they need to stop scamming us the weight of the seafood. 
How can 5lbs of crab possibly be 2 small vancouver crabs. 
And when you add a 4lb lobster... they tell they only have this 5.5lb one to charge you more. But in the end it still looks very small. 

Besides the tactics they use that are not very honourable, the food actually is amazing."}
{"text":"Came to the Amazing Seafood restaurant, which replaces the short-lived Miss Congee restaurant that closed down after only a year or so. 

Our dinner experience was off to a rough start when we found out our reservation was not recorded down for the proper date. Rather than acknowledging their mistake and apologizing, the lady at the front said they were fully booked and spent the next 5 mins flipping through their reservation book. Luckily the general manager finally came by and was able to give us an open table.

The restaurant atmosphere is very nice and has a very modern looking decor. The supervisor that came to take our order was very helpful and patient. However, some of the other staff could definitely use some more training. One server brought us a bowl while openly coughing with her mouth wide open, which was quite disgusting and unhygienic. There are no English menus, so if you can't read Chinese, good luck ordering.

The food here is generally quite good and the food was served quickly. The complimentary pigeon was too salty and the meat tough for my taste. The chicken was decent but nothing special. The snow pea leaf dish was very nice as it came in a fish broth soup. The ribs were also very tasty and delicious. We ordered the recommended flat fish, which was quite pricey at $38/lbs. For a 2.5 lb fish, there wasn't too much meat. But the fish was cooked perfectly and was very delicious. For dessert, they served a complimentary cashew soup with a couple of small mango and read-bean sweets, which was very nice.

Overall, I was pleased with the quality and taste of the dishes as well as the speed of the food service. The price is a little more than a place like Top Choice or Win's where you can also get fresh seafood, but cheaper than Dragonboat or Yu's. Once they train some of their staff better, get their reservation system sorted out, and have English menus, I would be happy to give this restaurant another visit."}
{"text":"\"Amazing\" is quite the overstatement. 

Price point was way too steep compared to the quality of food that was given. Dimsum menu didn't offer a huge variety nor dishes that required extensive work. Many items were considered Large, which is about $5+, so it's definitely pricey. 

Servers were staff from around the area (like.. other dimsum places), so service wasn't the greatest. They weren't rude, but they weren't exactly attentive and it took a while to get anyone to come over. 

We were placed in the little room beside the door with several other tables, and there was a staff member who's supposed to check in regularly, but evidently not regularly enough. 

Not my fav. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This used to be a short lived congee place but has now been transformed to Amazing Seafood House. It opened recently so it has some specials going on during dinner service.

We drove around lunch time on a weekday and decided to hop in for a try. To our surprise, it was pretty packed so we had to wait a few minutes for a table. I guess the people going for the pre-11 am early bird special have not left yet even around noon.

We sampled all the usual dim sum except har gau since it was $7. Just did not think any har gau would be worth $7. t. Everything was all right. We ran into their \"captain\" who we knew and frequented one of her former restaurants. She waived the person person tea cost and gave us a 10% discount so it ended up to be a fairly good deal. Since their dim sum (S, M, L, ...) is $1 more expensive than most around the area, it would have been a costly dim sum lunch had we not got the discount.

Parking is a bitch during busy dinning hours so beware. They have a free fried squab promotion going on right now so we will probably come back to sample their dinner service soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner for four here recently. For a $$$$ category restaurant, I didn't feel like the high price was justified. The food was mediocre-to-good, but not great. One of the dishes took an hour to come out. They changed our plates quite frequently, more than average, if you care about that. 

The restaurant is quite pretty inside, and it's in a plaza with Dollarama and parking is tough to come by, especially during peak dining times.

Overall, I'd suggest to try it to see what the hype is about. I, however, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not so amazing

undercooked chicken - wasn't apologetic

We ordered fried ribs with olive vegetables and got honey garlic spare ribs.

Service was indifferent and unattentive

Not amazing"}
{"text":"NOT-so-Amazing...We ordered the set menu for four with shark fin soup, which was the highlight of the menu. The soup was delicious and I would highly recommend it! 

Unfortunately, none of the dishes following them were particularly good and the service was horrible. They served a deep fried shrimp with wasabi mayo and fruits (blueberries, strawberry and kiwi)... Not sure which Chinese cuisine serves this. Moreover, it did not compliment the set menu and seemed like it was quickly slapped together.

In terms of service, the other waiters and waitresses do not pay attention to tables that do not belong to them. Our waitress barely came by at all, and we waited for at least 15 minutes after we were done two courses, leaving the empty plates sitting at the table. This is unacceptable for a Chinese restaurant that is marketed as upscale."}
{"text":"Great service; attentive and fast.   Their dim sums are good and they serve double steamed soup during lunch as well; an order is good for two ($5ish).   Dinner is a bit expensive and the foods are mediocre.  Lunch is worth the money, but not dinner."}
{"text":"Had a less than \"amazing\" lunch here during my recent trip to Toronto. If \"amazing\" describes good that is marginally better than an average Chinese restaurant for a much higher price, then it guess it's amazing?

Their dim sum menu actually isn't very extensive, with only 53 different items available. With large items already north of $5, I was prepared to see a bill of $60 for a table of 3. Sure enough it was around there.

The food, again, was only marginally better than a typical dim sum place...and that doesn't cut it. Dragon Boat is still the winner in that department, and if I want typical dim sum at typical places, I'd consider Tak Fu in Scarborough.

Service was also poor. It seemed the servers wanted to rush us out ASAP, since we arrived quite late for lunch (around 3pm), and they were setting up for dinner."}
{"text":"Need choices for dimsum that are not very common. But their domain menu is not big. Their dinner menus can be pricey, and there are no banners menus. The place is configured in such a way that it is not good for big banquets but business meetings. Clean place and decor. Friendly service. Tasty food and nice presentation. Price tag not too high."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off! I've been to several restaurants under the same genre and for the record this has been by far the only place that makes you feel they're only after your money. We dine here once prior to this experience we had and thought it would be a nice place to celebrate a birthday. We called in a week ahead to reserve a private room. We were told the minimum spending would be $500 to reserve the room. So we decided to visit on Wednesday (our dinner reservation was for Friday) to select our dinner menu. We were greeted by a so called \"Manager\" of the restaurant. She sat with us for 2 minutes to give us the menu and her business card. My partner and I went through the selection of food choices and decided not to go with the packages due to our several of our friends have particular allergies etc. By the time we finalized our choices we asked for the manager to discuss portions. We weren't exactly sure how big is each dishes. We started with 11 dishes and were told that won't be enough for group of 14. So asked for their opinion in such party what would be appropriate. We were advised each dish should be multiply by two and it would be combined as one dish on the day so it wouldn't take up significant room on the table. After taking in her suggestion we  were a little bit concern but reassured everything would be fine. Then she reviewed my order and said two of each side dishes wouldn't be enough. Again, this is our second time back at this restaurant. The first time it was a similar party arranged by a distant relative for group of 14 as well. We trusted her judgement and went ahead with the decision. On the day of our gathering we were stunned by the portion that was served. We called for a stop by the 10th dish served (two of each so technically 5 selections). But we were told everything is made already. Yet it was still not served until 30-40 minutes later. Our reservation was at 7:30pm, we left by 10pm. The bill at the end of the night was $1000 without alcohol. All our guests confronted the restaurant in the middle of our meal and was given a reply \"I told you it would be too much.\" This is definitely not a place I would be returning due to it's money grabbing strategy. I would much rather spend thousands at Fishman Lobster House than here! Be alerted of what the staff is telling you! We ended up with a table full of food to take home. They must of felt guilty because at the end of our meal we were given free dessert buns on the house."}
{"text":"My family and I finally came to try this place after it replaced Miss Congee. 

The decor was really nice and they had private rooms that you could book. 

The menu was relatively small, they had a la carte options and also prix fixe sets. 

My family got 6 items off the a la carte menu: 
- Deep fried tofu appetizer ($6.88) 
- Shrimp & Scallop veggie dish ($32.8) 
- Green Beans (14.8) 
- Sweet and sour pork ($18.8) 
- Stir fry angus beef with green onions ($18.8)
- Snow pea leaves in soup ($20.8) 
- Rice ($2 each... crazy) 

The deep fried tofu was delicious, but the portion was tiny, considering it was $7...
The shrimp & scallop dish was NOT worth it. They only gave 4 pieces of shrimp and scallop, so not everyone in my family got one... it tasted mediocre too. 
The green beans were prob my favourite, very flavourful! 
The sweet & sour pork was presented in a cute edible bowl, which was interesting. They served it with a lot of fruits. 
The angus beef was decent but 70% of the dish was onions and mushrooms
The snow pea leaves was a disappointment. It lacked in flavour, and was bitter. We even had to ask for salt to give it some taste.

In terms of service, I thought it was pretty poor. We asked our waiter 4 times for rice, and it took them about 20 min to bring it out. By the time the rice came, our food was cold. 

Overall, this place is decent but I wouldn't choose to come back because the prices are way too high for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Amazing Seafood House is not \"amazing' but quite A-OK.

We were here for dinner celebrating a birthday and was able to pre ordered some Chinese Birthday buns. Those are house made with a salted egg filling! So good and they were complimentary too! 

Braised Grouper Tail ($38.80) which I would highly recommend. It is great value with perfectly cooked fish and side of tofu, bean curd sheets and puff

Seafood in Rum Sauce ($24) was a miss. The sauce was watery and the seafood overcooked and not fresh.

The other dish we ordered all A-OK/

Dessert was nicely presented.

Service was attentive but we were there on a weeknight when the place is quiet.

Not a bad option if you are with a group of people and want to try out some Cantonese dish."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for New Years and loved it!  Lots of great dimsum dishes and their name speaks the truth.  Just a little pricy than most dimsum places but still yummy."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday to try out this new restaurant, lived in Markham for 6 years and dine out for lunch 3 - 4 days a week. So thought we would try this new establishment.  Went in and stood waiting to be seated, the place was 25% full, had to wave and wave to get seated although there were plenty of staff either standing or doing something. Finally got seated and again had to sit for over 15 minutes no menus, waved and waved and finally got menus, all in Chinese with small English subtitles below.  First glance very expensive and poor explanation of what the dish actually was. Decided to go with Dim Sum, ordered 4 small selections, 3 rice noodle as we did not know what the rest were, selections small $5 each, Ordered mix stir fry vegetables thinking would be safe, but it never came they forgot to order although clearly marked on menu card.  As well ordered small congee - pumpkin - has some corn in it and some purified pumpkin in 4 cups of water - $6.99 - compared to ANY other Dim Sum or other I have tried in Markham or Richmond Hill, this should be rated a negative  5 Star. Horrible experience. Not amazing all.

Save your money find other selection or go to McDonald s at least you will get enough to eat. 

I dont give this restaurant long to stay alive. By January will not be in business."}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant in Markham. The light over our table was flickering during the entire meal (probably due to recent renovation).

Highly recommend the fried tofu dish ($4.99). It's nice and crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth soft on the inside! I would go back just for this dish.

Our dinner also consisted of chicken (which didn't have much of a taste), lamb, Alaska crab, lobster, dessert and some other dishes as well. It came to around $750.00 and I'd say it's quite pricey in comparison with Fisherman Lobster Club. Probably would not go back for dinner.

*Edit: so disappointed because they raised the price of the tofu dish to $7 two months later!"}
