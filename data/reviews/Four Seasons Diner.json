{"text":"The foods are very delicious!!! It's the first restaurant which has porridge & many dishes in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't mess with the bold waiter, we asked politely for rice and he just started yelling at us. BAD BAD SERVICE and no one deserve to be treated like this!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, lady owner never turned in our order and we had already waited for 20 minutes for our cold dishes if we have never go to cashier register asked our food she just keep doing her own stuff. Really bad customer service and do not care the customers !"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. This is a Taiwanese restaurant, even their fried chicken leg with rice did not taste good. That's supposed to be a signature Taiwanese dish that's pretty hard to mess up. Most food lack taste & flavor.  We also ordered the spicy wonton, which is also pretty hard to mess up & it turned out with not much flavor either. I had to mix my own chili with soy sauce to try to make it taste a little better.  Definitely not come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is sucks. Mostly like a fast food place which most foods are precooked in a big batch. Definitely over priced. The noodle I ordered was like  a uncooked dough. Will never come again"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and walked in when it was still closed but for some reason a group of people had strong armed their way in. So we came in the door which was open and didn't get turned away. Rather the Lady working there was very kind and let us know what was happening and we were able to or some fish filet noodle soup. the food is decent but the 5 stars is for the lady that let us stay and eat, cause boy I was starving and wanting some noodle soup. thank you"}
{"text":"Cheap and hearty breakfast food! Pretty good stuff, especially for the reasonable prices. The corned beef hash and homefries was really delicious! But the biscuits and gravy was only so-so.   The waitstaff was really friendly and helpful, lots of coffee refills. Overall a fun atmosphere with lots of local charm."}
{"text":"This is a great Taiwanese food we can find in Las Vegas after days of buffets....  We will come back again for the porridge with three choices of dishes.  We also love the shave ice and ordered it every day as my kids request."}
{"text":"Food is okay generally. But the service disappointed me. 15% tips are mandatory which does't make sense to me. Water was not served till the end, and it still shows the option for tips on the receipt without reminder the tips already included."}
{"text":"Prong noodle soup is great but best of all beef brisket noodle soup! Taste just like Taipei food... Sooo good. I MiSS Night Market!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese porridge and reasonable price.   Great flavors. Feel like eating at home.  They need a bit improvement on service though."}
{"text":"taste very good! Very authentic Asian food. The sour spicy fish pot I will rate 10/10, for a reasonable price you can get a descent portion of veggies mushrooms and fish, and you can choose either rice or thin rice noodles to go with it. Also a great place for take out!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! Overpriced!  Me and my husband went and ordered two noodle soups and 1 appetizer, the total was 26 bucks! Too much for bad food... Never again!!! Ughhh"}
{"text":"I will never come back here! First off, they didn't have the item I want from the menu.. y will u have it on the menu then?!? Huh?! Then their noodles for wonton taste old noodle.. plus soup was no taste! As if colored water! Don't go here! I regret paying almost $50 for lousy food!"}
{"text":"We went there last evening as a last-minute place to grab some food after having foot massages at a local establishment. It was empty. However, the girl at the register was very sweet but had limited English capability.  My boyfriend ordered a bowl of Ramen I commented on a Seafood ramen but yet wanted some fried noodles. I guess she didn't understand what I said and gave me the seafood Ramen. It was good,but I'm not really a super Ramen fan. Not great on a seafood flavor either as there are things in the bowl I don't like the flavor of.   After we came in, we noticed three different Asian people coming in and noticed that there was a buffet like table, which she asked them what they wanted and it was put on a plate or in a to go box.  I wish we had known about that, she gave us a limited English menu when we came in that had pictures. Had we known about the buffet, both of us probably would have tried it And inexpensive, it was under $20 for two people. We would probably not go back, but try others in the area because there are so many restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Closer to 1 1/2 star.  Located where Mr. SANDWICH in the Chinatown mall used to be. We came here late night. We ordered the 3 cup chicken and pork belly plates and lemon white gourd tea with nata jelly.  My bf compares this taiwanese restaurant to cafeteria-style meal. Our food came out quick like 5 mins lol and then I understood. No real cooking involved I think. All food is already prepared and ready to go. Just requires plating.   The pork belly was good I liked it. Not one the sweet side and wasn't too salty. The rice had some minced pork and was seasoned with the minced pork sauce which gave it flavor which i liked.  He got the 3cup chicken and it was on the overcooked dry side. Like not enough sauce? Was not too fond of it, reminded me of filipino chicken adobo.  The meat ration was definitely small. I had three pieces of pork belly, one big, medium and small. He had small pieces of chicken.  I forgoed the side veggies. I got a tingly feeling on my tongue after eating the cucumbers and was scared to try the peppers lol.. the egg was hard boiled and I usually prefer mine soft boiled  We both actually liked the white gourd tea with lemon however, They gave us rainbow jelly instead.. we pointed to our server the nata but we got rainbow instead so we just stuck to it. I also wished they gave us more ice in the drink. The language barrier is certainly there.. we had to ask for water and I requested it with lots of ice. A younger lady was about to hand us a water bottle but we asked just for \"ice water\" and still there was not enough ice as most of the ice was already melting.  I ate earlier so I was a little full after but he on the other hand had to go to a neighboring restaurant and ordered beef roll  to go to satisfy himself.  Typical Chinese fast food service you can't expect much from."}
{"text":"Very good food!!! The fish and vegetables was most excellent and there was a lot to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Totally horrible experience?The price is over the quality?They picked trash and then served food without washing hands?They calculate tips include tax automatically?even customers probably pay double taxes without notice?"}
{"text":"Where do I start??? Staffs are friendly and that's about it. This place is not so clean. They sat us down at this spot where a build in bench seats by the divider wall. It also happen to have a column stick out half way and it has build in back padding as well. Anyway, why in the world would they put a table there? It can only fit back half of my bottom and I am just average size. Not even an 8 year old can sit comfortably there. I asked to change to a new table.  So now the food. Not great. Ordered the savory tofu pudding. It was basically plain tofu pudding with hot and sour soup. If you never had the authentic one before you won't know. It was just weird.  They also use really cheap disposable plastic Asian soup spoons and cheap chopsticks. It was so hard to eat with it.   Not recommended to try. Skip."}
{"text":"I don't know why but their attitude towards customers seems like depends on where you come from. Though we come from LA, the blue T-shirt waiter may thinks we are some Chinese tourists who cannot complain about their service nor give them a negative Yelp review and gives us the most annoying attitude the whole time.  The food is just ok, definitely not worth the high price. Save your money and go somewhere else to eat some decent Chinese dishes. The overpriced food and the way they treated their customers justify why they have such a low rating.  We will NEVER EVER come back to this awful place."}
{"text":"Wow, good thing I didn't see the other person's review before I can to this place. I'm not Taiwanese but I think these are suppose to be small plates and others might call tapas.  They are pretty tradition in Taiwan, and they are suppose to be served cold.  However, I do think it's a little bit high in the price but this is vegas.  Flavors are good and tasty, I give it thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I ordered pop corn chicken rice. The portion is good and it's less than 9 dollars. There are 5 side dishes. The taste is better than Noodle Pot and Liang's Mama."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and I ordered their pork ramen.  My husband says his soup was average and mine was below average.  No flavor at all.  And pricey for average food, $9 a bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm positive the ramen here is made with sewer water. It smells and taste like it was made in a toilet. I took a bite and had to fake an emergency  to get out of there. Unfortunately due to the excitement and kindness of the host I paid $12 (regrettable) and got a to go box to not offend. I then swiftly threw it in the trash two stores down. I would have given it to a homeless person but didn't want them to die of dysentery."}
{"text":"8 O'clock in the morning in Vegas I can get a set of Chinese breakfast of soy bean milk and a Chinese donut stick.  What more can I ask for?  My cousin had porridge and a Chinese donut stick.  We then have some beef and pig ear, and peanuts and cucumbers.  This is our cold cut for any meal of the day.    This place is alright."}
{"text":"My family went here to eat but the food so so salty.  My husband ordered the food on the menu chicken dish( it comes with fried chicken thigh, two side vegetables and one whole boil egg). However, they bring out the dish just a drumstick chicken with two small side vegetables and there's not the egg. My mistake came to this place to eat for our vacation."}
{"text":"This is an OK Taiwanese diner located in the Chinatown plaza. The service was a bit slow, and they totally forgot my sister's order of a strawberry smoothie.  I got the braised pork over rice with pickled vegetables. It was okay, but it was definitely not the best braised pork I've had. My sister got ramen, and the broth just tasted like chicken broth. She thought the noodles tasted like \"rubber bands\" which is not a good sign.  The bubble tea was pretty decent. The tapioca was very chewy."}
{"text":"One of my moms friends recommended this place so we went and had lunch yesterday.  We did their $7.99 special of 3 dishes and porridge (if you've read my other reviews you'll know I'm mostly paleo so I ordered the porridge aka congee for the other ppl at the table).  So what you do is go further into the restaurant and choose the dishes (on the left) that you want and then have a seat.  I wanted two meat dishes and was told that I could only get 1, so it's 1 meat and 2 veggies.  So I got the braised chicken drumsticks, cabbage and bamboo shoots.  There were 3 pieces of chopped drumstick which probably made up of one full drumstick, the favor was spot on on what braised Taiwanese meat should taste like so that was good but man I was still hungry after the meal.  The cabbage was ok, typical veggie dish and the bamboo shoots were bla.  My mom said it's bcs it's canned.    So this place received an A for inspection which is cool since they have an open kitchen and was preparing food right in front of us but the smell of sewage was gross.  I mean I know it's not their fault for a bad building foundation and drainage but if you are going to dine in, try and sit by the front.    The waitress didn't bring any water or tea so you'll just have to make sure you ask for it.   They had Chinese news playing on the TV screen.  All in all it was an ok meal.  I think if they gave a little more in portions it would be worth the meal.  My mom is still gripping about the price today haha"}
{"text":"Decent food and authentic taiwanese food. If you are hungry for this type of food. This is the place. Price is decent. Recommend try pork belly rice or chicken leg rice."}
{"text":"After voting early next door I was hungry and craving some authentic Home cooked food. The four season diner was close and while there was not really a lot of people in here we decided to enter because they had boba. The restaurant was very clean and the service was superior they where waiting for us even though we took a while to order. I ordered the coconut smoothie and the pork curry. It was delicious! It came with eggs and a salad. Delicious oh and don't forget the chili paste they have on every table was just amazing! I had a very enjoyable experience and everything came at such a good price will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Asian food in the heart of LV Chinatown.  Small hole in the wall with sublime food, just dropped in for a quick bite and this place really surprised me.  Ordered the vegetable and beans appetizer it was a spectacular cold, Taiwanese salad with deep flavors. Enjoyed the Soy based soup it was quite satisfying.  They made a tofu and vegetable dish that was to die for.  The bill was under $25.  The chef really brings it here!"}
{"text":"The low ratings here make sense. The food is generally okay but unremarkable and the Taiwan Meatball is especially bad - it's a thinly filled rice dumpling that tastes pretty meh. The service is fast and responsive, but I've docked a star because our tea was oily??? It looked like a sanitary issue with the teapot. Never had that happen before..."}
{"text":"I went there to order fish and vegetable Togo cost me $15.42 for a fried dirty fish . I didn't know till I get to the room and the fish still had a dirty gut inside"}
{"text":"This is not a bad place to eat in my opinion if you're looking for fairly authentic Taiwanese style food and dishes. Service is adequate. Most of the clientele comprise of Asians and Chinese."}
{"text":"One of the very few places left where you can get breakfast on a real plate for under $4.00, Four Seasons Diner isn't one of those posh, overpriced, stuffy, black tie affairs as the name may imply.  This is that local, community-centric diner popular for low-prices and filling the bellies of early-morning hordes of residents and workers alike.  Being situated on Rte 87 (Kinsman Rd) between Auburn Rd and Rte 44 and very close to the entrance to Punderson State Park (campers & RVers take note!), provides a very convenient spot on this major south-central Geauga County thoroughfare for both the weary early-birds and the hungry lunch-goers.  Camouflage (hunters), blue jeans & boots (workers) is common early-morning attire here.  And the place is decorated for the patriot at heart: American flags, including all branches of the military, adorn both wall and door.  The diner offers two menus, one being the more expansive breakfast-only menu which is served all day and the other for lunch.   Breakfast is served all business hours, lunch is an option served starting at 11:00 except on Sunday.  The diner is opens 5:00 AM (6 AM on Sunday) and closes everyday by 2 PM (1 PM on Sunday).  The breakfast menu has a thorough selection centered around variations of pancakes & french toast  ($3.25 - $4.50), Belgian waffles ($5.50), fresh biscuits & sausage gravy ($3.00 - $4.50), and, of course, eggs and the numerous ways to have them cooked with the variety of accompaniment options one could expect (including steak & eggs, $8.50).    Cheese omelets can be ordered with any number of 12 toppings (including chili or anything else they have!) @ $0.50 each and they 4 different breakfast bowls ($7.50) are offered.  Sorry, no Eggs Benedict on the breakfast menu but they offer a cheeseburger and fries ($6.50) if you crave it at 5 AM!  My wife tried the breakfast burrito and found it decent and filling.  She said it could use a bit more of the veggies and a dash more salt for flavor but was good for the price.  She'll be trying something different next time, like the Haymaker Breakfast Bowl.  Adventuresome that I am, I strayed from the ordinary (which in hindsight I should never do especially on a first \"date\" with any restaurant) and tried something more eclectic at the bottom of the menu: the Mediterranean Breakfast Bowl.  Helen informed me I was the first to try it as they had just added it to the menu - something added for the more healthy-conscious clientele, she said.  It was a combination of crab meat, spinach, red onions, home fries, tomatoes, and feta cheese normally on an egg white frittata (I asked to substitute that with whole eggs instead which they did).  It just wasn't my thing.  Hold on... don't take this the wrong way - it wasn't bad at all!  In fact, separately all the ingredients tasted fresh and was of good quality and flavor.  The food was cooked perfectly (they say the best way to test a chef candidate is to have him/her cook an egg - and in this case he'd pass with flying colors.)  I guess I just didn't care much for the combination in this way.  Maybe better if tweaked into more of an omelet or burrito?    The bottom line is that for the good quality and low prices, we're definitely planning to come back and try something a bit more on the traditional side of the menu.  Four Seasons Diner is the reincarnate of the former Judy's Restaurant which occupied the same space.  The present husband-and-wife team took over Judy's after she retired and sold the business to them in 2009.  The new owners state they remain conscientious about maintaining the breakfast service and selection that Judy had provided her faithful clientele for many years.  Virtually the only thing altered when the restaurant changed hands was its name.  (The \"Judy's\" sign by the road was there for a while until it finally got replaced.)  So next time dawn's breaking on the Geauga County horizon, you've got a rumblin' in the tummy, and only a few bucks in the pocket, stop by Four Seasons Diner and get your breakfast fix!  UPDATE (5/24/14):  Found the place closed a few months ago.  Checked online and apparently they had a fire back in September 2013 and has remained closed ever since.  Owner Ed Conklin has returned to chef at Blue Canyon in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I've ever had, and they are expensive too. I won't recommend it to anyone who expect a good Chinese breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay service. Food was actually pretty good so these Yelp reviews surprise me. Usually I'm very spot-on in terms of how the Yelp ratings are.  The beef noodle soup was very good, pig ears delicious, great Taiwanese sausage, and spicy wontons were bursting with spices and flavor.  I would come back again.  Tip: you order and pay in the front."}
{"text":"I'm guessing the low ratings are due to the lack of service?? They were crazy busy on a weekday morning and we got 0 service. I got up to get my own plates, bowls, and napkins... and no tea until the end of our meal. That being said, it's pretty standard of small Chinese restaurants and if you can look beyond it, the food is decent!  I liked the preserved egg congee and fried dough sticks. My husband got the wonton noodles which came with udon style noodles instead of the canto style egg noodles."}
{"text":"Came here second time on this trip to Vegas.  From a Taiwanese/Chinese perspective, this place is pretty authentic.  The pork chop rice dish and the veggie stir fried noodle were great.  The beef noodle was okay, and the pork ramen was decent.   Combining the two visits, well deserved 4 stars.  If my wife who is pretty picky with food likes it, it can't be bad like other reviews."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my parents and the daughter scanned us from top to bottom when we came through the door. Seems like all of their utensils and cups are made of cheap plastic and styrofoam. They provide paper menus for you to mark your order. We ordered the spicy noodles, duck leg noodles, and tonkotsu ramen. They gave us pork feet noodles instead of duck leg noodles!! Spicy noodles were INSANELY oily, as if everything was oil instead of soup. Tonkotsu ramen was also terrible: 90% of the pork was fat and the meat was dry and hard to chew, noodles are worse than cup noodles, and even the hard boiled egg had pink splotches on it. We paid and didn't get our change back, but it was 2 dollars so we let them keep it.   Worst restaurant I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine why the dishes here taste so bad...and the service...where is the service? I will never been here again. For sure."}
{"text":"This place was okay food, but it was really expensive and probably not worth the price. We came in looking for some stinky tofu that was advertised on the menus out front. However when we got the menu, they didn't have any stinky tofu. It's also a little confusing because there are two doors outside and two signs called two different restaurants. However, one of the doors days to use the other door, plus on the inside the restaurants were connected. It's just a little confusing because there are different menus on both doors but they're really the same menu/restaurant.  Anyway, back to the food. The seaweed appetizer was the only disappointing dish. They like included some weird part of the plant that's really chewy and stiff. Like the stem or something -- I don't know. It just wasn't very good.   The rest of the dishes, though, were pretty authentic and good. The wontons in chili oil were cooked really well and had the right amount of spice! The Taiwanese sausage was also pretty good. It could have been cooked a little longer and the garlic that it came with was pretty flavorless. The meat ball soup was also really yummy and the meat balls were so big and delicious!  Overall, the restaurant felt pretty authentically Taiwanese and the menu was also pretty authentic. The prices were pretty steep, but I guess it's on par with the other places in Chinatown. It's a decent place to stop in for some Taiwanese comfort food!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch this afternoon after my workout.  I was craving traditional Taiwanese comfort food and I knew this place offers that.  Yelp listed their opening time as 10 am but that is incorrect; they are open at 8:00 am.   I had a side order of cold tofu and a plate of Minced pork rice.  The tap for both items came out to $15.  Not bad at all.   They also have ready made items (like Panda Express variety) where you can build your own lunch combo; but unlike Panda Express, the food here is authentic and made for the Chinese palette."}
{"text":"Beef brisket noodle soup is very good.  Good service and inexpensive.  Desserts are pretty good as well. Noodles taste like hand tossed. Its a small restaurant and no ambiance. It's a good lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Family ran business. Lots of options, but the deli options were the tastiest. Don't recommend the porridge or ramen but the green onion pancakes were yummy."}
{"text":"Really bad restaurant!! Just tried to have lunch around 1:40 pm with 2 tables customers , not busy and ordered 2 dishes  dine in and No food served for 25 minutes and found out later owner forgot to place order . We sat there like idiots and on one to attend us ! We are hungry and really piss off!!"}
{"text":"I happened to be at Chinatown today and decided to randomly walk in this place. Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular.  Honestly in Chinatown, we shouldn't expect any type of customer service. At least the girl at cashier was smiling...  I appreciate the fact that they put pictures of food on the menu. When I see the name and its description, it's not as appealing to me. After looking at the menu, I decided to order Three Cups of Chicken Rice (or something similar to that) which came with marinated chicken, rice and some veggies. Chicken was too salty for my taste and was dry. I also noticed there were a lot of tiny bones in there.   My friend ordered Pork Belly Rice and it was pretty good. Pork belly rice also came with rice and veggies. Pork belly had a good flavor and was very juicy and tender. I should have ordered this considering how dry my chicken was.   I noticed they have varieties of ramen. Can't remember exactly but had a lot of options. Sora ramen is my go-to place for ramen but might be interesting to try it here. Restaurant is empty so you definitely don't have to wait to get in like Sora!  Looking at other yelp reviews, they have pudding dessert which I did not see on the menu. I would go back to this place to try that pudding dessert."}
{"text":"Felt that I really needed to write this. Ordered, Food came fast. Realized they were prepared food and priced at cook to order prices, Way too expensive. I got real pissed at the waiter but didn't tell him why. Brought our spicy dumpling with his finger in the sauce. Didn't say anything bc I didn't want our other food to be spit on. I thought the food was poor but didn't want to assume since I'm always critical. Asked my wife and my mom, they both finally spoke up and felt the same. Very bland and tasteless food. The beef noodle soup taste like it was water down. So is all the other food we ordered. Spicy dumpling was already cold and tks for the extra spice he added with his finger. Why was this restaurant packed? And a line out the door?"}
{"text":"this is a grandma-approved authentic Chinese food restaurant. Don't expect lots of service but the food itself is very good. It's also very fast. My grandma has been having trouble finding an authentic Chinese restaurant while traveling in the States. For the first time, she's not disappointed but instead is approving it as an authentic Chinese restaurant, which is golden. I would definitely take her here again."}
{"text":"One thing I cannot stand is ordering something from a menu and being told it is not available or is not served anymore.  Then don't keep it on the menu!  And then when offered a substitute like beef instead of pork or chicken, the meat is nothing but fat!  And the food is spicy but the menu does not reflect that. The place was crowded, maybe mostly tourists who will eat anything in Chinatown, I guess.  Finally, the servers speak passable English, but when I asked for ice water, they gave me hot tea in a glass.  I think I got punked.  Anyway, pass this place up.  There are much better Taiwanese restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I had the brisket noodle soup and it was really good! Service was great too. I'll probably come back again."}
{"text":"Came here not expecting anything great, but hubby wanted Taiwanese food. Don't judge a book by its cover it's very \"home style\" cooking here and all the dishes we ordered we loved. My husbands half Taiwanese and these dishes were very comparable to the meals we had in Taiwan. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The pictures on this restaurant façade were very enticing, so we finally decided to give it a try. The service was friendly and fast (the dishes, rice, meat, veggies, broth, are probably put together at order, but not made to order). We tried the Beef brisket rice, and the Miso ramen; it was ok, we were clearly not impressed. A 2.5 star experience."}
{"text":"Dishonest!   Went in Saturday night at 7:30pm and only 1 table was taken.  Lied about prices on cold dishes.. doubled the price when we got the check.  Charged 11.95 for a plate of stir fry veggie.  'hot' food on steam table was old and disgusting.  Worst of all, added 15% tips to the total without letting us know! We were only 2 people!  Not only that, on the credit card receipt, the tip line was blank so total amount in credit card receipt already had tip added!   So if you don't look at the check carefully you would have double tip!!!  Dishonest, bad food quality, and no service.  But most of all, the dishonest part really bother us.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"The flavor is lacking in every dish here. It's my fault for ordering Tonkatsu ramen at a Chinese establishment. However, even the traditional Chinese dishes were a let down. The prices were a bit high too considering how small the dishes were. Also, adding an automatic gratuity of 15% for only two people is kind of ridiculous, especially since we were never checked on, and our cups of water were left empty since forever. Everything I needed, I had to grab myself.  We would have tipped regardless, but I think adding automatic gratuity on one's receipt, especially if it's a small party where the server has done nothing, is sad lol. Oh welllllll."}
{"text":"FEEL BADLY CHEATED, WAY OVER PRICED. came here on a sat night dinner time. seeing they serve porridge, we were excited. not a busy place. we were given A menu, price looked ok. however we ended up ordering whatever was on the buffet. the cold dishes tasted ok, but too saucy. the hot dishes buffet looked old and filthy so we ordered a simple stir fried veggie WHICH CAME OUT BROWN AND MUSHY. these items were all on the OTHER menu we NEVER were provided. at the end of the meal we were charged 38 dollars for three small plates of cold dishes $6-7, and the stir fried veggie $12, and the billed also AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED $5 TIPS for minimal service. is it even legal to include tips on the bill FOR A TWO PPL PARTY? my husband gave them the credit card, and the credit card bill came again with a tips line. had we not known, we would have paid tips again. this small dish porridge meal costed us $43 at this run down filthy restaurant. WAY OVER PRICED. NEVER AGAIN, AND NEVER SHOULD YOU."}
{"text":"The worst place that i had ever been. They had lot pictures in front like milk tea and dessert s but they have nothing and their food taste so terrible. Bad service, bad food."}
{"text":"We went to Chinatown, hoping to have some authentic Chinese breakfast. Chose this one because of their ad. Worst food and service. Deep-fried junk. Food is not fresh and yucky. Would never recommend or go back. BTW, they charged us more than we ordered. Avoid, and run run run away from it!!!  Just found this on youtube - Dirty Dining: Four Seasons Diner in Chinatown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEM8axlSga8"}
{"text":"If we can give it a zero, we will. If you are a tourist & looking for Chinese food in NV Chinatown, stay away from Four Season Diner. We don't want you to be the next victim & ruin your trip experience. Most terrible services and food there I have ever tried in my 20+ years of dining experience in the U.S. My wife and I left the dishes unfinished. We paid and left.   The time we walked in, the Noodle Pot next door filled with no tables left while Four Season had only one or two tables filled. That was a sign and I wasn't pay attention to it. My false.  We went to Noodle Pot next door the following day. Their Beef noodle is one of the best. The pig ears are good too. It's spicy but it is just right that everybody can taste it.   Four Season, please close your store. Do something you are good and customers will be proud of."}
{"text":"The guy wiped his nose, didn't wash his hands, went ahead to make my food with his filthy hands. Freaking sick. Freaking sick. Freaking sick."}
{"text":"I came with high hope for this place because the chef came from a previous Chinese restaurant where I really really enjoyed his cooking. However, I left pretty disappointed after our visit here. If it's not for the taro/yam balls with tofu pudding dessert, I would give 2.5 stars.   When you first walk in, you will see a buffet line at the left where you can pick two or three items combo. It came with either rice or yam porridge depending upon your preference. I tried two different type of bamboo shoots, roast pork belly, roast pork and tomato with eggs for the combination. We also ordered dry pork (pork sung),crispy intestine and spicy stinky tofu on the side. Besides crispy intestine was not bad, everything else was like 2 out of 5. The small dish of dry pork (pork sung) was $5 which we found it so ridiculous. We were fairly unsatisfied and disappointed.   Till we got our dessert tofu pudding with taro/yam balls, I was semi happy with the meal again. The taro and yam balls are nice and chewy, pretty comparable to Meet Fresh.   As far as service, most Asian places have pretty terrible services I have to say. This place was not an exception. This one young guy works in there seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He also seemed very impatient every time we asked him for stuff.   I think I might come back and try their beef noodle soup and other dessert in the future. On the side note, they sell ramen which I found it odd."}
{"text":"The service was so fast on a Friday morning when few people were there. Awesome.  The scallion pancake is very good, perfect balance of crispy and soft. The Chinese donuts aren't the freshest, but pair well with the soymilk. The tomato and egg was pretty refreshing, as was the porridge with yams. Authentic."}
{"text":"Good food friendly service Priced just right  Will come back for the next plate   See my photos, also was offered a fork"}
{"text":"I literally am nauseous and feel like I'm going to puke. The food is so disgusting, i got simple chicken ramen and i won't lie, i like the thicker noodle but the people who say it tastes like toilet water are not lying and the chicken in my ramen was like hours old fried chicken trimmings, literally smelled and tasted like old grease. Please trust the reviews."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food with cafeteria dinning style. Which is not to say food is inferior. Quite contrary food is authentic and very tasty. You see, cafeteria style food in E Asia means you see the food before ordering it; all the food are laid out in for you to choose.  They've done cafeteria food proud.  However I was surprised to learn rice costs $2. I've never heard a Chinese restaurant charging extra just for rice. I order 3 small portioned dishes plus rice for a dinner box to go, it came to almost $11.  Perhaps being in Chinatown their business is mainly tourists. Just saying."}
{"text":"Never quite acquired taste for steaks so coming to vegas I'm always looking for authentic Asian food especially Taiwanese style.  Happy to say this is the best place I've found so far.  Probably 4 Stars for food but 5 Stars for easing my cravings for my taste buds after 3 days away from home!"}
{"text":"The food is nasty. Stay away. Over priced and the food is simply nasty."}
{"text":"Horrible service and attitude, shitty food :) We asked for rice politely and the bald guy just started yelling at us like he owns the place... My grandpa told him to stop that attitude, he told us not to waste his precious time and walked away. This experience totally ruined my morning, we walked out with a bad mood while the bald guy giving us dirty looks."}
{"text":"Customer service was okay. We were given dirty tea cups. Swipe your finger in the cup and there's black stuff on your finger. There was hair in my dad's soup and mine. There's not so much flavor and a bad after taste. Worst soup I've ever had. Top ramen is better. Its was too pricey for was we got. I do not recommend this place sorry :/"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. I went there yesterday trying to get some lunch, so I got the combo that comes with 3 dishes and rice, on their menu, it says $7.99 if you get 2 vegetarian dishes and one meat, or $8.99 if I get 2 meat dish and one vegetarian dish, which I picked all vegetarian dishes, and I asked if I could order an individual pork chop which they did it but it ended up to be $15 so they charged me almost $7 for a small piece of pork chop, I just moved to Vegas so I'm not so familiar with the price range here so I guess I took it as the way it is and the taste turned out to be ok so I went back for the second time today ordering the same thing and guess what? This time they charged me freaking $17 for the same combo with the pork chop, what a rip off! 3 dishes with rice and one small piece of pork chop, and I looked at the menu, it says the pork chop with rice is $7.99, which comes with rice, pork chop and 2 side dishes, so why would they first of all charged me $7 for just the pork chop yesterday and charged me even more today!? I didn't bother to argue cause I just won't be coming back, I'm sure there's many other places I can go that won't rip me off like this."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Friendly staffs (4) ok food (2.5) food is expensive (1). My overall experience was ok. Definitely not an authentic Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"The owners backgrounds may be in fine dining, but Four Season Diner is simple and soulful food.  The term diner takes me back to a simpler time when coffee came in only one flavor and you found 'Diners' on the side of highways that that cruise slowly through Americas heartland.  Four Seasons is exactly that kind of place, found on the side of State Route 87 in a town that didn't seem to have a stoplight, (at least as far as I traveled).  I had the Chicken and Waffle Bowl with cheddar hash browns.  Yes, this is a more modern day combination but is was served just the way you'd expect at a Diner, simple and delicious.  Come comfortably dressed in your well worn jeans and favorite concert t-shirt to eat and embrace the small town pace.  Be forewarned that if you chose to blow in styling the latest Armani, Gucci or Vera Wang, you'll still get the same friendly service.  However once you leave you will be the topic of conversation of everyone, after all it is a small town diner."}
{"text":"It was the second time I've had ramen in Vegas. I probably could have had better options but it was a spur of the moment decision. I've passed by this place a couple of times but I have always passed over it when deciding where to have dinner, but I have always passed by the pictures. the Beef Brisket noodles always caught my eye and I finally had it. The build up was worth it they were very good. We also had some pan noodles. Those were very yummy. They're Thai Tea was definitely not the best I've ever had but their Passion Fruit Slush was pretty good. Their Mango Slush was alright. This place isn't very good for other dishes besides noodles. It's a bit over priced so I probably won't go again but it's a good one time thing."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket soup. Not a particularly good place but on the other hand the food is not bad. I had requested to have the msg be left out so the soup was not as flavorful but nonetheless preferred it to be left out. The fried yam leaves were tasty and so were the 3 cup chicken. I suspect this is the kind of place where I have to find the dishes I like and the yam leaves is one of them."}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing dinner to get some good food into our system.  Unfortunately, unlike my friends, i did not find the food to be good, just OK.  I had the Spicy (Ma La) Noodle, thinking that it would be a dry (or stir fried) noodle dish, but ended up getting a bowl of noodle soup.  The broth was spicy but one dimentional.  There was some ground pork and about 3 slices of pork belly (that wasn't well seasoned).  It was edible, but not satisfying, and I believe the broth was what made the dish weak for me.  I also ordered the Yam Leaves.  They were over-sauteed in the the leaves became somewhat mushy.  Some of the stems should have been cut off and disgarded as they were hard to chew (on of my friends actually had to spit out some because the stems were too fibrous, a sign that the vegetable is not young and at it's prime tenderness).  The menu is limited, offering more ramen soups than Northern Chinese noodle soups/noodle fair.  They have pictures of desserts and dessert/boba drinks posted on the walls inside the restaurant.  However, they do not serve dessert (WTH, false advertisement), so take note."}
{"text":"Want some taiwanese food?? Here's the place to come!   Cute little store located in the chinese plaza (where 99 ranch is located, i think the location is a bit off on yelp)  There's a buffet line where you can choose a few items to eat as a dish or you could order off their menu for a rice place or noodle bowl.   I was dying to try to mala stinky tofu but they didn't have any :( :( I guess they have to get the ingredients from further and isn't always available, so i'll make sure to call next time to double check. Other than that, the food was good to me.   Also, probably want to bring someone that speaks mandarin, I think they probably could speak English but definitely mandarin is first language."}
{"text":"It's good to learn about this place serving TW lunch/late night snack style buffet with varieties (3 or 4 items) to go with sweet potato porridge or steamed rice at your choice! There are some traditional dishes, such as bamboo, 3-cup chicken, braised pork, non-deep fried stinky tofu worth of trying. Won't be as good as the authentic ones in TW, but at least you can taste a piece of feeling here in town."}
