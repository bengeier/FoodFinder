{"text":"I was seated at the bar, being served by George, the husband of the owner.  A well dressed black couple came in and waited patiently for service.  George looked at my half empty drink and asked what I want next.  I said the couple at the end of the bar have been waiting and I dont know what I want next. George stated \"I dont want those kind in my bar, they caused before the fire, and now I want a different kind of customer here\".  George was visibly upset with my line on questioning, so I left and will never return.  Make your own conclusions on his behavior, but I would rather patronize an business that serves all races with equal respect."}
{"text":"I have never written a bad review of anything. But I'll make an except for this hell-hole. 

Played here two years ago as part of the Deutschtown Music Festival. Bartenders and staff looked shocked that we were even there. We started playing at 6:00pm and someone immediately ran over and told us we had to turn down. We turned down and played another song, and again --- we were told we had to turn down even more. We obliged and started to play one more song, and they started approaching us again to turn down. At that point, we just stopped playing and gave up. Why would you sign up to be part of a live music festival and not want music in your bar? 

So whatever, we ordered food and drinks and just wanted to move on. I got a fish sandwich and fries - greasy, slimy, barely cooked through. I picked at it and drank my over-priced Yuengling draft. Eventually, we got our tabs and they were all wrong. The servers tried to overcharge us, adding on drinks and food we hadn't even ordered. Thanks guys, sorry we weren't your cup of tea! Thanks for being so accepting and understanding! 

The crowd of folks here were miserable broskis and jerks. You couldn't pay me to go back here."}
{"text":"The food is so good I almost don't want to tell anyone and I'm a picky a@@ b$tc$. The bar tender is nice and the food is so good!!! Love it here."}
{"text":"Larger (mostly bottled) beer selection, include lots of selections from local/nearby brews including Great Lakes, Church Brew, Full Pint Penn lagers and ales, a couple offerings by PA standouts, Troegs, Weyerbacher and Victory and some farther afoot quality selections such as Dark Horse, Terrapin, DFH and Green Flash.

Tasty but typical barfood.

SUPER friendly owners. As posted above, apparently the place burned down in 2009 and reoppend in spring 2010. I went there as a Caps fan on  New Year's Day just before the winter classic and they made us feel right at home while giving us some choice anecdotes about the city."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite and stopped in.  Bartender was fantastic. Friendly and greeted me immediately.  Wasn't drinking because I was on work lunch break, but the beer selection is awesome. Opted for the Reuben and a bowl of the broccoli soup. Both were excellent. Great food, great service and a comfortable setting.  Awesome combination to say the least.  Prices were good as well."}
{"text":"The biggest problem here is the lighting. It's simply too bright and it kills the vibe. When I first walked in, I was struck by the barren/sterile feeling of both the bar and seating area in the back. At one point it inexplicably got even BRIGHTER, as some additional green lights behind the bar came on. At first I thought it was last call or something, but it was only 10:30pm on a Saturday night.

Beer list is solid but not mind-blowing. Taps included a rotating Great Lakes, Dark Horse Crooked Tree, Rogue Dead Guy, Big Hop and SA Chocolate Bock plus Guinness and a few macros. Bottle selection is much larger and a board behind the bar tells you what's newest. Prices are about where they should be but maybe a tad high: two Rogue drafts, a Nugget Nectar bottle, and a bag of chips was $18.

The owners were tending bar on a fairly busy Saturday night, but honestly they had trouble keeping up. When asked which Dark Horse was on tap, Irene didn't know. You could tell both she and Dean were working hard, but it was a struggle. It was a little hard to watch since Dean is so friendly.

It's great to see a revamped place like this in the neighborhood (don't be scared away by the outside), but there are better hang-out spots nearby."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place.  Great happy hour and big beer selection.  Bartenders can make any drink under the sun.  And the menu,  despite being limited, has a lot of well prepared tasty food."}
{"text":"One of the best local gyro spots in Pittsburgh. Solid beer selection, as well. Can't go wrong here. Recommend for a couple's night out if you like local greatness."}
{"text":"Really like the Modern Cafe, dont judge it by the outside decor (a bit dated it seems, but what do i know)

Inside is very nice, tons of beer selection. Bartenders are good, can be a bit slow sometimes but cant we all. 

Food is off the heezy! Had a few different things over numerous trips but the greek cheesesteak is where its at!

4 stars for the Modern"}
{"text":"Stopped into the cafe to meet some friends on Friday night ..  what a good vibe I felt even walking in. Not what you expect from the outside..  spacious, bright (but not too bright) clean.  The bartenders on the ball and so friendly.  The patrons were even friendly!!   I love the fact that this establishment has a jukebox!! I had a great time playing it and it was really a fun night.  The restrooms were the cleanest around!!  I cant wait to go back and try the food.  Parking is free on the street after 6pm too!! 

Thanks Modern Cafe.."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great food cheap and owed by a mom and pop. Owners are extremely nice and really down to earth. Bar was just redone after it burned down 2009. Large beer selection."}
{"text":"I ordered a take-out lunch from here for my whole office.  The order was all correct, the food was delicious, and everyone at the restaurant was super nice and helpful.  They even helped me carry the food out to the car!  I had the Mediterranean Salad and it was very good.  I asked everyone else in my office how their food was, and everyone really enjoyed it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Ask for amazing Amanda behind the bar! She is a perfect angel and will make you cry tear drops of pure joy!"}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise in Pittsburgh's North Side. It may not look like much but the Greek specialties they had were phenomenal. Lemon orzo soup was the best I've ever had. The gyro is not only great but a large generous portion. Well worth the stop at it's close to the Carnegie Science Center and the National Aviary."}
{"text":"This is a cool little neighborhood bar on Western on the North Side. With a 50s diner decor, this place (as others have said) is much bigger on the inside than I thought it would be. It's a large open area, and I would even argue it's too open and not very intimate. However, this seems to be a nice place for locals to stop in for a drink after a long day at work to chat with others in the neighborhood. Many people at the bar seem to know the bartenders and other patrons well, which can be good or not-so-good when visiting as an outsider. I only had a plate of fries, but the menu seemed pretty impressive and I'd like to go back sometime for a meal. The draft list was decent in addition to a nice bottle selection."}
{"text":"Try the Spartan Sandwich. (From the Modern Cafe website) Steak, Gyro meat, Provolone & Feta cheese, onions, tomato slices, special steak seasoning & dressing topped with tzatziki sauce on a 6\" hoagie.

So good.

The bar itself is OK. Not a lot of ambiance, but a great neighborhood place. I no longer live in Pittsburgh, but used to spend a bit of time at the Modern Cafe when I lived in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I recently had a few friends in town from NYC for a meeting.  We ended up stumbling across the Modern Cafe and could not have been happier. We were crunched for time and they were very accomodating and helpful.  The food was very good, but the main draw was the service.  The folks there were incredibly warm and inviting.  Will be returning when I have more time to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood bar, it's hard to find a better option. Friendly service, affordable prices, strong section of sandwiches and occasional karaoke. The appetizers are great! Especially the one with grape leaves. Don't look past Modern if you need a quick meal and a drink while on the north side."}
{"text":"NEVER GO ON A TUESDAY - possibly the WORST service I've ever had. Some creepy old guy refusing to serve anyone who wants their tab closed - so I have to leave a tab open all night for all your sketchball friends to use? Um no - sorry, not about to get SCAMMED at this gross bar. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Overall quality sandwiches and alcohol... Not super cheap or super expensive right in the middle.  Not somewhere I go often but definitely a solid choice if looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat or a quick beer

Also bartenders are usually very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place! We were in from out of town for the Steelers v Packers game and stopped in here for lunch. Met Dean and his family (the owners) and they were awesome! A friendly crowd and great conversation. Food was great! My husband had a gyro and I had chicken tenders, both great! Would definitely recommend to catch a game with good beer and good service. Go Steelers!"}
{"text":"Great bar on the northside of Pittsburgh. I love love love their happy Hour. The place has such a hometown feel. Pretty diverse crowd that frequents this place. 

I told the bartender that I wanted a sweet Shiraz wine. She didn't have anything, but she was able to mix some moscato with some merlot and voila! So good. The service was relatively quick. 

I didn't order any food, but I was with some people that did. They loved their meal. Next time I go, I definitely will have to order something."}
{"text":"Wtf, listed open till 2am on Google but kitchen closed when we got there at 9. Even the yelp said 1230"}
{"text":"We've visited the Modern Café a couple times, always after eating next door so I can't comment on the food.  I have looked at their menu before and it seems like your general bar grub.  Modern Café is a nice stop for drinks.  They offer a large variety of bottled beer and a rotating draft list, along with a stocked bar.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap, maybe 12, but usually they have one or two that I like.  

The setup is cool but creates some bottlenecking of people around the bar.  This past weekend when we stopped in I had to fight a crowd to get to the bathroom since that many people were just standing and talking.  This wouldn't be a big deal but there were a bunch of tables further back, past the bar, where they could congregate and be out of the way instead of being a fire hazard.   

All in all, not bad place to stop for a drink after a good meal in the North Side."}
{"text":"I have found yet another reason to hang around on Western Ave. 

I'm really starting to like it down there.  As an alumnus of CCAC Allegheny I often times just hurried passed storefront after storefront never taking a second glance at the many great establishments that line Western Ave.  Well now that Western Ave is within walking distance of my new home, I've been slowing down and exploring what the avenue has to offer. 

The Modern Cafe is great.  I like the old school neon signage that hangs in front of the bar. I like that it's attached to deli that actually has corned beef on the menu and I loved the selection of seasonal pumpkin beer."}
{"text":"We stopped through Pittsburgh on a road trip and were looking for a quick bite to eat.  We found the Modern Cafe's staff friendly and food delicious.  My daughter had the wings which were crispy and delicious. I had the Spartan sandwich which was great! Unlike any sandwich I've had before it was a gyro served on a hero bun. Nice hot too!  My sons both had burgers which they raved about.  Great food great experience!"}
{"text":"Great local joint with a fantastic beer selection. Prices are on the higher end, $5-7 for a beer, and the service can be a bit spotty if you're not a regular. I was passed over several times by the bar tender because she was taking care of the regulars first or finishing her conversations with her friends. By the end of the night though my service was fine and I was being treated like a regular!"}
{"text":"This is a great little nieghborhood bar.  Great service - nice people.  Great beer selection and reasonable prices.  I would give the food an ok.  They have your basic bar food - the fries are nothing to write home about.  
This was the bar use in the movie \"Wonder Boys\"  - sadly the bar was ruined in a fire in 2009 -they only a have a few of the art deco pieces left - but they have done a nice job of restoring the place after the fire.  

Also - they have trivia nights on Tuesday's at 7:30."}
{"text":"I had a city dining card for this place and figured it would be a great place to try after going to handmade arcade with my family. 

I did not expect it to look the way it did inside. You walk in, and there's a bar - then you walk past the bar into the little dining area. It was super adorable. It was Sunday around 6 and we were basically the only ones there besides a few at the bar. 

Our service was fantastic- the waitress was friendly and helpful when trying to decide what we wanted. We ordered the grape leaves for a small appetizer. I've never had grape leaves, so I have nothing to compare them to- but they were pretty terrible. They were cold, mushy and tasteless. I would never get them again. 

My mom ordered the Reuben and my dad ordered a cheese steak. They both agreed they weren't the best sandwiches they have ever had but they were good. I ordered a pepperoni roll and coleslaw. The pepperoni roll was not that great . It wasn't bad, but I've had better ones from get go. The coleslaw was tasteless. I added pepper and some salt and it didn't do anything to help. 

The only reason I would come back here is to drink. They had a decent draft list , I ordered southern tier 2xmas which was really tasty. The atmosphere is adorable and the service is great, so I would like to come for a drink sometime when I'm on the north shore. If I do visit again, I won't be eating a meal here :/."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

Food is great. They have really good Greek food. (gyros hummus etc.)

Owners are great! The owners are fully dedicated to its success and often have beer tastings, bands and recently a Guinness night where they taught customers how to properly pour the beer from a tap and gave away Guinness and glasses."}
{"text":"I came here at the end of a progressive dinner-date when we decided we weren't done chatting for the evening.  Calling it a cafe seems to be pushing it--maybe during the day it would be more appropriate to think of it as one. It seems like a decent local hang out to shoot the breeze and watch a game, as there are plenty of tv screens and a long-ish bar.  The interior is a bit dated (and seemingly not in a deliberate way), but it's not scungy or divey. I just ordered a bottle beverage and no food, so I can't speak to the cocktail or food quality. Just very middle-of-the-road overall."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood looking for a place to eat. We stumbled upon the Modern Cafe and it had exactly what we wanted!

The menu is perfect and has something for everyone. Drink menu is larger than what you'd expect. The owners are the icing on the cake because they add such charm and history to the business!

We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This review is purely based on going in for an hour and getting a couple of drinks.

This neighborhood is really cool. I'm not from Pittsburgh and have never really hung out downtown except for a Pirates game, so my wife and I were looking for a local bar before the Kenny Chesney concert this summer on a Saturday. An old style neighborhood with small town charm in the middle of a city.

There was a mix of locals there and people there for the concert. The bartenders were very friendly and seemed like they had fun with their job. Others in the bar were friendly as well. They ranged from a single loud guy at the end of the bar yelling at the soccer game, a family having dinner, some concert-goers, other couples, etc. It was a good vibe for what we were there to do.

Other families and groups were eating an early dinner toward the back at the tables. They also have outdoor seating so you can people-watch out on the sidewalk.

I appreciate their half-off drafts from 4:30-7:30(??) on some days of the week, which included Saturdays. They have a very wide selection of beer in general, but the draft selection is better than average!

I would definitely go back here for the same purpose before a concert or ball game next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Just what all of the reviews say, Modern Café provides a great beer selection, good music at a reasonable volume, pleasant service, and a nice casual atmosphere. 
Great place for hanging out during the week."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick drink and appetizer while I was out exploring.  The service was a tad slow, but very friendly.  Ordered an artichoke bruschetta - a bunch of parmesan toasted bread with a bowl of the bruschetta topping - DIY style.   It tasted good, but was a little sloppy and had too many onions for my taste.   My drink was good, but served in a stemless wine balloon - a weird choice for a captain and coke.  Overall, a decent neighborhood bar, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great bar with a great atmosphere on a Friday night - Their Happy Hour is 4:30pm-7:30pm - perfect for a work happy hour after a long week."}
{"text":"Don't really like to post bad reviews but I have been here several times and I really want to like it,  unfortunately,  the bartender george is one of the worst people I have encountered in the service industry.  If u are reading this George,  its not hard to pretend to tolerate people, try to be somewhat attentive to paying customers instead of displaying your shitty attitude. The woman...dont know her name is very sweet and good behind the bar.  Unfortunately,  when George is there,  u have to beg for a drink,  menu,  anything really because he can't be bothered. I will continue to go to this bar as it in my hood I just wish the servers were better."}
{"text":"If you don't have The Modern Cafe in your regular rotation you're missing out. If you aren't enjoying their delightful happy hour you're missing out. If you aren't overwhelmed by their great selection of draft (and bottle) beer - that Dean continually updates - you're missing out. And believe me, if you've only come to drink here? Well my friend, you are REALLY. Missing out!! You're not the kind of Yelper who wants to miss out are you? Then get here!

Ok, the beer selection is top notch. Dean is among the nicest owners you'll ever meet. But the food here is absolutely amazing. Irene works magic in that kitchen. Sure, it's bar food and sandwiches. But saying that does a disservice to what comes out of that kitchen. It's far better than that. In fact, the sandwiches The Modern entered into the annual\"best sandwich on the north side\" competition came in FIRST place the last two years. And maybe the year before that. And they beat some pretty stiff competition. And I can tell you from first hand experience that they deserved the win! 

So go ahead. Don't just take my word for it. Try it yourself. Maybe you'll get hooked on the Greek cheesesteak. Or maybe you'll find nirvana in one of the other tempting delights. Have a beer. Order a sandwich. I'll meet you there next time....."}
{"text":"A quaint little neighborhood bar. Delicious sandwiches. Super nice northsiders. What more can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"Awesome little neighborhood joint... even if you do not live in the neighborhood :)  I first discovered Modern Cafe upon moving back to Pittsburgh after having dinner at Nicky's Thai Kitchen next door.... such an awesome find!  Great beer selection, great juke box, great service, and super clean restrooms (for me this is a big deal).  Amanda (one of the bartenders) is indeed amazing!  She remembers everyone and is just a pleasure to chat with.  I have seen some of the food, but have yet to experience it.... but from what  I have seen, it looks yummy.  

I highly suggest checking this place out.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Different place, with an old school feel.  Always wanted to stop in and see what the decor was like.     Decent selection of beers, although they were out of two.  Someone was smoking in the back, which was a bit unnerving.  Otherwise, a decent stop to make for a beer, or gin and tonic.  Go for happy hour for the best beer deals."}
{"text":"stop by and say hi to mandy! i've been to the burgh a few times now and she is our favorite part of the north shore! best pub style bar by far in these parts"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Modern Cafe. Everyone is just the nicest, and their happy hour is second to none. Granted, I might be a little biased because I work around the corner and am here all the time, but this is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on my way back to work and got the feature buffalo chicken salad.  It was a large iceberg salad with carrot ribbons,tomato a few cucumber slices and black olives.  Decent size for the price and the buffalo sauce was tasty.  Disappointed that they seem to use grilled chicken strips from a bag and the ranch dressing was from a jar.  Fresh salad dressing really takes things up a notch in my book.  The service is great though."}
{"text":"If you're in the north-side stop into this neighborhood bar. The food is homemade with some Greek flavors. 12 beers on tap with countless craft beers by the bottle. 
The owner/bartender is fun to chat with and the other employees are really pleasant.
Bar/restaurant is clean and vibrant."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a little local bar like this. Modern has an excellent beer selection in bottles, accompanied by a small, but decent draft selection. Their food menu, prepared next door, is better than you'd expect, although I've only had a sampling of items.

If you're looking for a chill local bar with a welcoming vibe and nice attentive bartenders, Modern is your spot.  It's really clean, and the crowd is laid back. It's the perfect place to spend a low-key evening out with friends, or to grab a drink before or after a dinner at Nicky's!"}
{"text":"Thinking of places in the North Side to meet my friend at last night, I remembered the Modern Cafe on Western Avenue. I had a rather negative experience the last time I was here, which was probably at least six months ago, however, last night more than made up for the first time here! My friend and I arrived around 7:30 (just after happy hour ended-boo haha) and took the last two seats at the full bar, closest to the door. They also have a lot of tables beyond the bar, however, none of these were occupied. I never caught the bartender's name, but she was awesome, very friendly and patient, particularly considering my friend and I chose to catch up for quite sometime before ordering any food. They have a good amount of craft beers on draft so I went with the Green Flash Soul Style IPA after the bartender had given me a taster of it. Green flash in general is one of my favorite breweries and this totally hit the spot! My friend went for his usual Yuengling. After scanning the menu, we decided to split the Mediterranean layer dip (Hummus, diced tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumbers and topped with feta cheese. Served with warm pita chips) and the Spartan sandwich (Steak, Gyro meat, Provolone & Feta cheese, onions, tomato slices with our special steak seasoning & dressing topped with tzatziki sauce on a 6\" hoagie). The dip came out first and it was a HUGE portion for $8.99! It was really good and filled with all the good stuff, namely feta and olives-YUM! The pita also was grilled and warm when it was served. The sandwich, which was split for us back in the kitchen (without having to ask which was nice), was ginormous and both of us agreed we would not have been able to go it alone and actually finish it. My half had a lot of sauce on it, which is exactly how I prefer my gyros, and you could taste all the flavoring of the feta too. The meat was slightly dry but when paired with the sauce, it tasted pretty good. Since I live relatively close, I'm always going to keep Modern Cafe in mind when I'm looking for something quick, particularly a good craft beer since the bartender said they rotate frequent;y."}
{"text":"I called to ask about the happy hour specials. The staff member only gave one word answers until the staff rudely said 'I'm busy at lunch right now- you ordering food or what?'  I clearly will not be ordering food from there ever again. Disappointing since I've dined there before with no issues."}
{"text":"Ok, the Reuben was a bit charred but Italian sub and the Nachos were gone before I could get a picture of them."}
{"text":"\"Stand up and take a bow James!\" 

\"Go home to your mother Vernon.\" 

\"I... am... a writer.\" 

These are the quotes of the most re-watchable movie I know, Wonder Boys, and one of my beloved ones. 

On a frigid Friday night, staying in The Point downtown area, it took a few drinks and a few mentions to successfully lobby the one person that loves Wonder Boys more than me to go to The Modern Cafe. \"Look, when else would we ever come to Pittsburgh, we're in our Wonder Boys town, and we can sit in the red booth where James Leer, Grady Tripp & Terry Crabtree met their maker in Vernon Hardapple.\" Pulled that card, and off we went, and what happened was in a way straight out of Wonder Boys. 

While Vernon didn't wiggle his bum and dent the hood of our cab, the experience had a tilt to it. We both hail from cities where people are always around us -- especially Toronto -- and our night in Pittsburgh was not so. Everywhere we walked streets were empty. Each bar was empty. Especially this one. One bartender. Four at the bar. And holy what speed ball did that bartender and group of friends get into? 

The space is huge for such a low key place. Bar up front, TVs, and then in the back is a long booth against the back wall, and we sat in the very seats our Wonder Boys did. Look, it's nerdy maybe, but if you're at all inspired by it, we sat in the corner and talked all night. 

The four interactions I had with the bartender were upbeat. Very upbeat. Speedball upbeat. And this isn't to say I wouldn't recommend her to be a bartender for the night. 

Looking back on the night we probably shouldn't have gotten into the Ford Taurus of the bartender's friend who drove us back to the hotel, but accordingly to them we didn't have a chance at getting a cab over there at such a late hour. I doubt Modern Cafe would ever set up a car service. With such a strange night, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Vernon Hardapple comes back here to reminisce. 

With being an institution in some of our eyes, and offering a pretty odd experience... 

Take a bow Modern Cafe!"}
{"text":"First and not last time dining at this little gem! Stopped for a late lunch with a friend and we were smitten by the burger menu! I opted for the Greek burger, friend got the Hawaiian burger and we shared an order of onion rings. Truly the best onion rings and best burger I have ever eaten! The onion rings didn't have all the onion slide out in the first bite. The burger, cooked medium, with feta spinach and tomato on a Brioche bun....heavenly! And my friend loved her Hawaiian burger! The owner was the sweetest man with some great stories to tell! Friend and I vow to go back and eat our way thru the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood bar nestled in the better part of the North Side. I've been here a number of times and have always enjoyed myself.  Good beer selection, friendly service, decent bar food."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I wrote my first review for The Modern and since we've become regulars here, it's high time I fixed this! Cute little 50's decor themed bar & restaurant with a very comfortable vibe. The craft beer list changes frequently but, always has something I'm excited to try. Sampling isn't a problem here if you're unsure of your choice. 

The sandwiches here are to die for! Their sandwiches have won the Northside Sandwich Competition a few times and for very good reason - they're fantastic. The Spicy Sicilian may be my favorite sandwich ever with a close 2nd their Gyro Melt! They're both indulgent & packed with flavor. You're guaranteed to sit there making 'mmmmmm' sounds!! Hubby feels they were robbed of the sandwich prize the year they entered the Greek Cheesesteak, his personal fave. 

We also absolutely adore the owners, Dean & Irene. They work so hard and genuinely enjoy their customers and their business. 

We will continue to come in for our beer and delightful sandwiches regularly and enjoy a chat with Dean & Irene! There are also Happy Hours on weekdays. It's fun here!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch the other day when I was lost looking for the aviary. I got a Veggie Hoagie that was massive and some grade A customer service. 

While I was kind of disappointed there weren't any espresso drinks on the menu, they do have hot coffee and liquor, so you can pick your poison depending on the time of day. It was also nice that they had free wifi, so I could work on my computer while I charged up my other devices for directions. 

The bread was soft and fresh and my sandwich was garnished with a pickle. I'm pretty sure the shrooms came from a can, but the fact that they had a veggie option at all was pretty cool. 

For whatever it's worth, those bathrooms were the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen on the North Side of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here before the steeler game Sunday, hoping to grab some brunch. We ended up all getting sandwiches that were delicious. 

I got the beef and bacon sandwich on asiago ciabatta. It was so yummy! But it would've been like double yummy with some kind of horseradish mayo or sauce or something. 

The owner was incredibly nice. It felt like a nice family establishment where people know your name. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this little place. Friendly bar tenders and good food. The bruschetta is delicious and I really like the hummus plate. I've had a Reuben there before as well that was good. You can buy six packs here as well."}
{"text":"This neighborhood bar on the North Side is exactly what you'd expect when you walk inside. During art school days many of us lived on North Side and we've been going for years. Great drinks and interior with friendly staff. I only wish I were on the NS more often."}
{"text":"I was not expecting the look of Modern Cafe to be so... classic. It's pretty much a neighborhood bar. But I'd say it's a fairly good one for the North Side.

It's way bigger than I thought it would be. A little lonely feeling for a lunchtime. Out of so many sandwiches it was hard to choose, but I went for the Reuben. I'd say they're a tricky beast to tackle. It was okay. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. I like mine loaded with sauerkraut, and this just had a decent size for someone who likes an even distribution. But not me, load it on! I was a little bummed the bread was a bit soggy. That's the worst, right?

I asked the dude for a suggestion on a side and he said try the coleslaw because he doesn't like mayo. But when it came out, there was no question, it was a mayo based slaw. I love mayo, so that was fine. Not bad again. Just okay.

I think this bar would be my jam if I lived on the North Side. TONS of beer on tap that I'd for sure want to tap into! Maybe I'll treat myself to a happy hour there... Let's be honest, he beer will come a'callin!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, and Dean is always so friendly. They have a great selection of craft beers which are HALF PRICE during happy hour. You cannot beat paying $2.50 for a good beer. For food, the Spartan is always a good choice, or I'll opt for a chicken salad sandwich with soup."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys, and an even bigger fan of the movie adaptation of the same name. The bar scene was filmed here, and I mentioned it in passing a few times. It turns out Toronto is pretty close to Pittsburgh and we didn't have Friday plans and did have a rental car so away we went... to get drunk in this dive and sit in the red booth at the back. Mission accomplished. 

I checked out a couple of stellar establishments in the rust belt, but I want to review this one first. It was a very fun time, but the bar itself is kind of strange and riddled with questionable characters. I'm fairly certain I had a five minute conversation with someone who had recently been smoking crack... and I'm from Ford Nation so I should know. 

PEPPER PROPS to a friendly bar tender who poured cheap drinks happily and kept the shady folks in check. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: Come on, Pittsburgh. Figure out your taxi situation."}
