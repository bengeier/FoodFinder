{"text":"Really really great casual and quite family restaurant.
The dishes are big and the waiters are friendly.
I used to go there during the week nights so it was never too busy but always yummy.
There are a couple comparable restaurants in the area and I have visited all of them, but Antons has  a bit of a different flair to it.
We ordered have had almost all they had on their menu, my favorite nontheless is their chicken and lamb shish kebob.
As Vanessa mentioned in her previous review, the salads, which to be fair most restaurants in the area add up to the meal, are grandiose.

I hope you enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because it was a Monday night, or perhaps there's been a change of management, but my last experience at Anton's did not warrant the 5-stars I want to give it.

I used to go to Anton's at least once or twice a month for some garlicky goodness in a loud (in a good way) and comfy, casual family restaurant. The food was always fresh and plentiful. It's a meat/fish and starch place - and everything always used to arrive sizzling hot and seasoned boldly (for game) and or on the side (literally a glob of minced garlic sauce for beef). My fav was the salad that comes with every meal - the dressing is phenomenal (more garlic)! 

After being away from the area, I was stoked to get my garlic breath-on, amongst the clamoring crowd of customers. But this time, Anton's was quiet - there were only two other small tables of guests. While the salad didn't fail my expectations (phew!), my entree (New Mexico Chicken) was dry, really dry. 

Hopefully it was just the night, b/c this place WAS among my top-five in North York."}
{"text":"Good food. But they had an amaaaaaaaazing all you can eat lunch buffet that has been stripped down and reduced to almost nothingness, very sad about that. Good parking, good service. But I'm still crying about the all-you-can eat which is not what it was..."}
{"text":"I went to Hamizrach, the new Kosher version of Anton restaurant.

The service was quick and polite. The waitress brought out some appetizer salads and pitas for the table, and they were really good. The time it took to order to the main course and prepare it was quick.

The food was good, but nothing special. The food is essentially the same as Anton's, but Kosher. If you are not Kosher, then I would recommend trying a place like Me-Va-Me or Sofra Grill, where you get more food for the same price."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on March 5th...

The restaurant doesn't have the fanciest decor but the food is exceptional.

The Manti - Bucharian beef and lamb dumplings were outstanding

The Last Samurai Sushi was soo good my wife decided to take another one home... she said that it was the best sushi she had ever had in Toronto!

Our only issue was with the lamb skewer dish that used lamb shank as its basis and thus was hard to chew... perhaps if they had used 2nd cut lamb it would have worked out better.

A nice bottle of Chilean kosher wine cost us $22 (it retails for $11) was a pleasant suprise.

Total bill with tip: under $100... I'd go back in a second,.  So should you."}
{"text":"I've been consistently disappointed every time I have been to Hamizrach. They constantly run out of Laffas (A larger form of Pita bread) and their descriptions of what is on the menu is not entirely accurate of what they offer.

Last time I was there I ordered the Chicken BREAST Shish Kebabs with steamed vegetables with Lentil Chicken soup for starters.

Chicken Lentil Soup: Oily, I felt like I was going to slide out of my seat.
Chicken Breast Shish Kebab: Apparently the chicken breast is the same thing as the thigh at Hamizrach and for $17  there is very little left to the imagination...as well as the plate.
Steamed Vegetables: The last time I had steamed vegetables, I was pretty sure they were not doused in oil...In fact I believe it makes it the complete opposite of steamed vegetables if there is any oil in the vegetables as there should only be water in steamed vegetables.

Overall, I'm not happy with this place. I would definitely not recommend it. Don't expect to see me there any time in the future."}
