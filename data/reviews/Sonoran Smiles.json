{"text":"Don't go!!!!! Went for a pain in my upper left back molar. They came up with an extensive bill of almost $500! To remove tarter in between two teeth.  I went to another place or a 2nd opinion and they removed the tarter for free!!!! Wow.  Turns out the pain wasn't even the tarter, it was a wisdom tooth coming in. I almost had to pay $500 that wouldn't have even fixed the problem.  I went to Jones family dentistry. They are the best. I'm tired of these greedy, dishonest business people and smiles by Hanna is one of them.  Go to Jones family dentistry in chandler, you'll never change dentists again. I don't work for them. Just giving friendly advice."}
{"text":"I came to Dr. Mansoor when my previous dentist could not take care of me during an emergency. Smiles by Hanna is not cheap, but I was happy with their work initially.  The staff are all friendly which makes an office visit much more pleasant. Unfortunately the veneers I got talked into when I initially wanted crowns, had to be replaced by crowns.  I was then charged a \"discount\" to replace the veneers that kept falling out.  The final one was installed without showing it to me and I was asked to sign their letter of acceptance after it was installed.  The color on that last crown does not match and I am totally disgusted with the result.  I will not return to even try to have them fix it.  Better to cut and run.  Wish I had been a Yelp user before I went there."}
{"text":"Just received a message from this business' attorney threatening me with a lawsuit if I don't take down this review telling me that writing a review based on my experience is \"illegal\". Isn't that what Yelp is for? Wow. Be wise when choosing a dentist! Another example of why we have happily switched dentists."}
{"text":"Find another dentist.  Office is full of hype trying to get patients to write good reviews for free stuff.  Then they flake out and never do what they promise.  Dentist had an assistant trying to do dentistry.  Bad!"}
{"text":"I went to this provider about 3 years ago. Dr. Mansoor charged me over 110 dollars per visit and what made it worst is I had insurance. My teeth hurt from a broken tooth and all she wanted to do is clean my teeth. I had my teeth cleaned 5 times within 8 months. The only good thing that came from that doctor is the oral surgeon they referred me to. I ended up going to another dentist because I was so frustrated with Dr. Mansoor. The other dentist I went to was awesome. He said he couldn't understand why they only cleaned my teeth when he could clearly see that my tooth was broken. I told the dentist that the first cleaning was fine. But Dr. Mansoor would only clean one side of my teeth and then made me come back to to do the other side. Then she would charge my insurance as a teeth cleaning. So she said I needed 3 deep cleanings.  That would be 9 visits. My insurance would only cover 2 cleanings. So after the second cleaning, which was the other side of my mouth. I had to pay full price which was around 150.00 dollars or more. After the 5th visit, I was so mad I cancelled my appointment and went somewhere else because my teeth still hurt. I still have all the receipts of all the over payments!"}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasant and made getting teeth done an adventure rather than boring and painful."}
{"text":"So after years of writing this review they message me and offer me a credit to come back. Are u joking?? I ignored it and now they are threatening a lawsuit. What??? You shouldn't have a profile online then if you don't want people to express how they feel about you. And you should do a good a better job so people leave you good reviews instead of threatening people to take down bad ones. Get your act together."}
