{"text":"Loved it! 
The food was outstanding. (Try the lemon tart!)
Susan was extremely pleasant and really connects with her customers.
Like the other reviewer said - quite romantic. great place to take a date.
3 course dinner w/bottle of wine was $65 each.
cute place. you can dress casual but it also lends itself to spiff it up a bit for a date.


(That \"date\" word keeps coming up!)"}
{"text":"Wow.  Sorry - Le wow.  Lemon tart is outstanding.  Chocolate mousse is lovely.  I had a filet mignon in a mushroom sauce that was superb - the sauce was in my top 10 food experiences.  My wife and I went through a whole loaf of their bread sopping that up after the plate had been cleared.  A very welcome addition to the strip."}
{"text":"I had a ladies dinner last week at Beau Lieu Bistro. We went to this place completely clueless as we didn't know what to expect. Anything online had old reviews, their website lacked photos but we were all in the mood for a little French.

Blink and you will miss this location on Ossington. I frequent the Ossington strip and never knew it existed. The exterior of the location leaves something to be desired as does the decor on the inside. People discussed it being romantic but I found it a bit... stuffy for lack of a better word. 

The server was very pleasant. He was quite keen (we were his first table).. We were the only table that evening and so we were WELL taken care of.. almost to excess! He informed us that they just re-opened the week prior but couldn't tell us why they were closed in the first place. (bad sign?). 

Despite the awkward entrance into this meal, we all loosened up with their wine list (not extensive but pretty good). I had their Escargot to start... amazing. I tried a friend's Pate which was equally delicious. For dinner I had the Peppercorn Steak which was cooked to perfection and the sides were very complimentary. 

My main concern for this place is that it's not pulling in the customers and with the prices being more on the steep side, I worry their doors will be closed before anyone has the chance to try them. I really hope i'm wrong as the food alone will have me visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on new years eve.

The venison was the most tender I've ever had, and was thoughtfully accompanied by mildly sweet poached pear.

The lobster was also great, with an interesting sauce.  For the record, it may have been a tad springier than optimal, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

My girlfriend said that her fish (halibut?) was among the best she's ever had.  I'm not really a cooked-fish person, but I tried it and I admit it was quite successful.

They also accommodated our raw vegan friend with a diverse spread of nicely presented raw vegetables.

I had to leave early (i.e. skip dessert) but a friend who stayed said that the raspberry tart was perfect."}
