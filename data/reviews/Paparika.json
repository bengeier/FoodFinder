{"text":"This place is bound to be a great success.  The two women who run this place really know how to cook middle eastern cuisine.  Hummus with spiced beef was exceptional.  I would recommend to anyone, and I now can't wait to try other dishes.  They really wanted to ensure that my experience was great.  What nice people.  

Great addition to Bradford.  Good luck"}
{"text":"Great food and service! It's a family run business and environment! It's a small but cozy restaurant and the food is super yum  to start, they bring out a whole assortment of yummy tasters of pickled veg and toasted pita. Today my family and I got the chicken schnitzel with Cajun potatoes, chicken hearts with rice and the 5 lamb chops with home fries!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch this week and had the hummus with falafel balls and a mint tea.  The mint tea was great with fresh peppermint.  The falafel balls were well cooked and moist inside.  I often find most places either over cook or under cook falafel but they had it right.  The hummus is freshly made daily and has a really nice flavour to it.  I took home one of their challah breads which are made in house and it was excellent.  I would highly recommend coming here if you like food from the middle east with a Israeli flavour"}
