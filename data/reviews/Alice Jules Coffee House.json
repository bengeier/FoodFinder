{"text":"Great ambiance. Very friendly. Comfortable seating inside or out. Tasty drinks."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the drink are good and the workers are friendly, seems like a nice place to hang out with friends and just relax. they are quick and making your drink,Glad to have this in downtown monroe!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy country feel to this coffee house, with a computer you can use to brows the web as you sip on your beverage. small home like setting but very pleasant. service is wonderful and produce for smoothies are fresh. come down and enjoy a nice cup of coffee, or maybe some tea :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! Great coffee and awesome staff :) You won't find coffee this good anywhere else! Comfortable atmosphere- great for studying, meetings or just hanging out. Brewed coffee is always great. Must try Captain Jack's Java!"}
{"text":"Quaint little \"vintage\" coffee house. The service is good and the coffee and snacks are also on par. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to stop for coffee for years -- whether it is to pick up ground coffee to make at home or for a cup to go or to walk in and spend time with my daughter. It has an eclectic vibe with paintings, music, crafts, and jewelry by local artists (many for sale)."}
{"text":"Moving here from the west coast, I couldn't have been more relieved and happy that this place exists! Why you would go to Starbucks or get crappy dunkin donuts coffee, I don't know.  Right on the edge of downtown, but in a delightfully rickety large southern wooden house. A+!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the opportunity to enjoy a coffee before  work with my wife and or friends. The drinks are made fresh and ar tops in town. The porch and side rooms are perfect for relaxation and conversation."}
{"text":"This is a cute place to meet someone for coffee, but don't go there if you need wi-fi, because it is terribly slow. I have been to Alice Jules 3 different times, and each time it was difficult to do much on the internet. If speed doesn't matter (say you just need to send an email, or something else like that) then perhaps it will be fine for you. When I checked the speed it was only hovering around 20 mbps. And unfortunately the drip coffee is not very rich. It's a bit weak. But it does have a really great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, love the treats , pleasant service. They always have awesome recommendations for coffee. Would love it if they could cater The CATA football games."}
{"text":"Cute place! Friendly service! Good coffee!
I had an iced coffee with almond milk it was very good and I was so excited they had almond milk :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Well trained staff/baristas who deliver a consistent product.  The ambiance is hip for Monroe so it's a welcome harbor from the country vibe that permeates most of the other Monroe restaurants.  It is a fabulous meeting spot and so it is unfortunate that their hours do not extend later into the evening for locals who work and commute.  This seems to be a trend in downtown Monroe that drives people out to 74 for Awful Mc Donald's coffee and the surrounding historic district really suffers for it.

But when you go, try a Chilly Alice, London Fog (earl grey and steamed milk) or a caramel latte!"}
{"text":"I love this place and so does my girlfriend! This is the best little coffee place around. The coffee is always great and the baristas are always friendly."}
{"text":"Coffee is ok. They have some quality issues. I've been in several times and the quality varies depending on who the barista is. The regular drip coffee and the iced coffee is pretty good. I would steer clear of the espresso drinks. Most of the baristas don't pour the shots in the milk immediately after they pull the shot so the drink tastes old. The ambiance is cozy and the employees are always friendly, though."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened years ago. I love Dawn & the whole family. The coffee is good, the atmosphere is great. My favorite coffee is Gilligans Grind. The chilly Alice frappes are great. This is a place with heart and welcomes you to stay.  I just wish they were open later! But go there. And get a scone."}
{"text":"Great overall experience. I recently moved to the Monroe area and am a college student. It was nice to find a place to get an assignment or two done without the crowds and lack of seating that Starbucks provides. I sat out on the porch (which wraps around and offers even more seating) and enjoyed an herbal tea and probably the best scone I've ever had. The staff was very nice and brought my drink outside to me. I've also bought artwork that they have near the front from local artists"}
{"text":"Pros: 
Lovely place
Friendly service 
Good music 

Cons:
Average coffee 
A little overpriced
no wifi - only free for a short period then you have to pay to stay on longer. 

Overall I would go back for a nice relaxing cup of tea and for the ambienance but not optimal for work or homework."}
{"text":"I got a standard iced latte and it was pretty good. Definitely standard for the area. Service wasn't super fast, but the pricing was great and there were lots of places I could sit. This is a great place for locals!"}
{"text":"Cute antique style house inside, big covered porch for outdoor seating and a few tables on side walk with a umbrella covers.
Staff friendly, nice selection of coffee and sweet treats to eat-- coffee was good, fresh. A big plus for me is they have almond milk. Yeah!!"}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good.  I order the same thing almost every time and it varies with who is working.  Overall good place and folks are friendly."}
{"text":"Very good quality coffee. Enjoy the small town neighborhood feel. Private sitting area or good with friends. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Charming, chill vintage-home-turned-café that is ridiculously easy to spend the better half of the day in. Abundant seating (i.e. tables, couches, outdoor/front porch furniture), a calm yet entirely lively atmosphere, and very personable and engaging waitstaff all contribute to Alice Jules' ever positive word-of-mouth. Coffee quality is top-notch; pricing decent. Ultimately, nothing but good vibes at this joint."}
{"text":"Down from Charlotte (had some early morning business at the post office) and was surprised to see a coffee house a 4 minute walk away on Apple Maps. Pleasantly surprised to find a vibe similar to Amalie's (NoDA district in Charlotte) and seriously excellent artwork hanging around the shop. The dark roast was spot on and the homemade chocolate muffin was a sinful treat. I would have taken a picture but it was gone before I started the review!"}
{"text":"Super excited they had almond milk for diary intolerant, and my latte tasted fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Alice Jules Coffee House is quick, simple, and cozy. My favorite part about this place is the setup. I love that it is located within a house, allowing for separation with multiple rooms and different lounging areas.

I visited this past week and it was decorated nicely for Christmas. This place creates a homey, comfortable and toasty vibe, perfect for both the cold and the coffee. I met a few friends here as they were finishing up their \"coffee break\" and we found ourselves locked into comfort and relaxation. Our coffee break was extended.

One of my friends desired a bit more coffee and was granted a fresh refill for only $1 more. I have no doubt I will be returning again here soon. The baristas were welcoming and extremely personable, taking the time to walk you through what they had on drip. This could quickly become one of my new favorite spots to enjoy a coffee run."}
{"text":"I like the old house in which they built this business.  I tried the blueberry scone that they make.  It was delish.  I enjoyed drinking a decent coffee while working on some school work."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon for a Carmel latte. Over all the coffee is good. I was bummed to see they use low quality syrup but are charging the same prices as some of the higher end coffee shops that don't use high fructose syrups. They do offer almond milk so that's a plus in my book! I paid just shy of $5 for a small that's a bit steep for this quality."}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop in downtown Monroe. Laid back atmosphere with free wifi! I normally get a regular light roast, but i noticed they change up their daily specials on coffee and lattes.  I've seen some pretty cool descriptions that involved  \"Salted Caramel\" ...so they have my attention!"}
{"text":"Solid local option for coffee, breakfast sandwiches and pastries.   They have almond milk!  

Fresh and delicious options.

Cute little house with some seating inside and out.  Cramped, but cozy.  Fast and efficient service.

You can tell it's a local favorite and it should be."}
{"text":"So good and so quaint. I come here any time I'm passing through downtown Monroe. The coffee is great and so is the service. They're always so nice and helpful when I don't know what I want. Such a pleasant change from other larger coffee places."}
{"text":"I would not fully enjoy my coffee at the coffee house because their wifi is weak. I am always prepared since i work on the run so i had two other options, my own hotspot and TWCwifi. I couldnt use my phones hotspot cause of one bar signal. And somehow twcwifi was weak also. So if you plan on using internet. Its not up to par as the other free wifi cafes."}
{"text":"Eclectic old home turned into a comfortable coffee shop. I was at the Ag Conference Center waiting a few hours for my daughter and it was well worth the 15m drive. Very good handmade Creme brûlée latte"}
{"text":"I really wish I could like this place because I've had many friends work there over the years and they love it here. However, the coffee quality just isn't that great. I've tried a number of their roasts and their espresso drinks, but they're just not up to par with other small coffee shops. I've always found the drip coffee weak, and the lattes taste pretty bad. As another reviewer pointed out two years ago, the baristas don't know how to pull shots properly.

If you're in Monroe and looking for a local coffee shop, this is really your only option (other than La Vida Mocha - but that's just as bad since the owners changed), but don't expect anything above par."}
{"text":"Cute little local coffee shop.  Perfect place to relax and grab your favorite coffee. Great customer service and good coffee."}
