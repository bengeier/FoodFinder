{"text":"Theme is good. But service is horrible. 
Food took 30+ min to arrive. 
Sandwich did not come with the lettuce, onion, pickle etc we had specifically asked for. 
Our waitress said they had a rush, but the restaurant was hardly 20% filled. 
I am not going there again. 
Really bad experience."}
{"text":"So Treichel's is a great place to fuel up for power shopping at the outlets, and it actually doesn't require that you have a Saks budget!  

The burgers are massive and tasty but we tend to go for the buffalo chicken wrap salads.  Everything I've had here has been delicious but we always seem to forget it's here.  

The wait staff is friendly and most of them are super efficient.  There is also a bar and plenty of manly decor on the walls (by design?)."}
{"text":"Its a really cute restaurant. Went there with my Mom for lunch today. 

The atmosphere is cute, very 1950's dive-y. The service was good also, everyone was really friendly! Always had refills, and food came out quickly. The portions were generous for the price and it was pretty good. I had the fish and chips with onion rings. I like the outdoor seating too! Will return on my next visit to the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Went to the new Cuyahoga Falls location on Hudson Drive.  It's an old school looking diner with a lot of cool car memorabilia and antiques. The service was very friendly and did a great job making sure customers were happy. Also, the prices were fair. I had the Phil \"Steak-n-Go\" with fries-pretty good but nothing you can't get anywhere else. They offer endless fries, have a good beer menu and serve slushies which I thought was different and kind of cool. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"50s themed restaurant in the Aurora Outlet that serves everything under the sun that is fried or grilled.  The restaurant isn't part of the food court- It's in a separate building on its own.  Juicy burgers on sesame bun, which come with a decent sized portion of fries are good to get here.  They also have entrees like fried fish, shrimp, and chicken sandwiches.  They have a burger challenge that will earn you a spot on their wall, but at this point in time you would have to conquer 7 pounds of burger to actually win- I will pass on that one!"}
{"text":"My first time here was a visit with just my sister and I.  When you first walk in, the decor is of the 50's style and just a tad sparse and cheesy, but the place was clean and neat.  The hostess was pleasant and seated us promptly.  Our waitress was slow to attend to us, but she was very friendly and had a lot of good advice.

Our drinks were refilled timely but the surprising thing was the food!  I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak with fries.  Something basic and easy and if it turned out bad, then I wouldn't come back.  BUT!  It was AWESOME!!!  It came out hot and smelling fabulous.  It was one of the best sandwiches I had ever had.  The fries were fresh, hot and very good!  Crispy on the outside and just perfect on the inside!

My 2nd time I came to visit, I brought my husband and kids.  They loved it and the food was awesome again!  Everything hot and fresh as if it had all just come out of their cookers.

They never seem to busy, so I don't know how long they'll last, but I gotta say, I've never had such great food considering the places around the area!  Worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"The place is designed like an old style diner, it's actually pretty cool.
The food is good, pretty much what you'd expect from this kind of a place. But the staff is very friendly, and the atmosphere is nice and quiet. 
The location is debatable. Unless you spend a few hours shopping the outlets, in which case it's a great place for a sit down meal."}
