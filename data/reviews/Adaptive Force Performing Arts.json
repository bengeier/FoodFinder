{"text":"AFPA is a GREAT dance studio!  My daughter has been taking dance there for 5 years and it has been the best experience we have ever had at a dance studio. Mike and Amber are always friendly and warm and treat us like family. The teachers are knowledgeable and always professional.  Their prices are comparable to most of the other dance studios we have been to.  I love their facility! I would recommend AFPA to anyone that wants a exceptional experience in dance.  I also love how they have exercise classes for parents!"}

{"text":"My son has been dancing at AFPA for two years now.  He's in Mr. Ika's boys hip hop class and HE LOVES IT!  He is constantly showing off all the cool tricks he learns in his class.  My son has gained confidence and a zest for dance since joining this program - which is very special, as a mom, to watch.  The environment is positive and encouraging and I would recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for a place where your child can thrive."}

{"text":"My daughter had been taking classes at Adaptive Force Performing arts for the past 4 years. My experience has been nothing less than perfect. The front reception desk has always been professional and knowledgeable about classes, tuition and schedules and the teachers are fun and inspiring. Mike and Amber have always made my daughter feel welcome and special. They have provided very good training & master classes as well as a positive learning environment for all of their students."}
{"text":"Just wrapped up the year with yet another amazing top notch recital at AFPA!! We have been with Amber and Mike for 7 years. My daughter started taking a few classes when she was 4 and did that for 4 years. She moved into the performance group at the age of 8 and then was asked to be on the competition team and is going on year 3 of that. Through all of the years Amber and Mike and all of the teachers have promoted growth and confidence in her with a positive and nurturing environment. My daughter has turned from once a bit shy to a confident, happy and mature 11 year old. She absolutely loves AFPA...everything about it! She truly considers it her second family and I'm very appreciative that we have this studio in our lives!"}

{"text":"Beautiful and clean facility- local families are fortunate to have such a large studio with high caliber staff and training opportunities across many disciplines. Highly recommend for kids of all ages who was to develop their skills in the performing arts!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this dance studio. I have known Amber and Mike for about 12 years and they are the most giving and caring people I know. Not only do they work hard to keep the children happy and healthy but they are incredible teachers. I wouldn't want my child to go anywhere else. Thank you Adaptive Force!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe the negative reviews for Adaptive Force. I have met Amber and Mike many times and have found them to be warm,  caring, supportive, and encourging teachers. They want only the best for their students. My neice has become one of the most independent, and confident dancer with Amber and Mike."}
{"text":"I decided to sign up my granddaughter for dance and I'd heard some good things about Adaptive Force.  We been taking her there for a few months now and I'm very happy with the instructors and how they interact with the kids. My granddaughter loves to dance and she has been developing quickly.  As long as she is happy, I'm happy!   They have a ton of kids dance classes for every age and level, including hip hop, ballet, tap, contemporary, musical theater, acro, lyrical and more. My kids love Mr. Mike's tap and the boys hip hop class. At the end of the year they hold a recital, which is like going to a professional show! The studio is kept neat and clean, plus it's big. AFPA has four dance rooms, and a big break room for snacking or studying. If you sign your child up here for dance, you won't regret it. We wouldn't think of going to any other studio in Phoenix."}
