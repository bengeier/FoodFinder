{"text":"staff was extremely rude, music was too loud. Food was meh. I actually thought it was a nightclub when we walked up, and I think they do music and scene-posing much better than food. It's also pricy. Do yourself a favor and go to the mych much better MangiaFoco down the street!"}
{"text":"More sizzle than substance.  Meals were 'heavy'. Miss:- The Braised Bison Ribs -recommend a pass Win:- The gnocchi - too much oil Service:- Still learning Cleanliness:- Good"}
{"text":"Cool place, relaxed ambiance, incredible food, comfortable and cosy. A gem. From the appetizer to the main course all was flawless. Full of locals, trendy."}
{"text":"Love this place. The guys here are absolutely stellar. Good food, great service, top valet service, good company, always a little extra, amazing terrasse...what more. Top 5 in MTL for sure."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere in old Montreal, service was great, very attentive. Not a fan of their booths as hey are made of this crushed velvet imitation fabric which looks great but sticks to your clothes as you get in!   Wine and charcuterie were delicious, I had the mushroom pasta which tasted great and dessert was also pretty good (lemon tart was good but a little too sweet, carrot cake was to die for).  Only complaint would be in relation to my friends pasta. She had the duck confit gnocchi but it was excessively oily. Not sure if that is how they serve it or if the lid fell of the bottle in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"We had some bad luck on our vacation in Montreal. Three times we chose a place for dinner via Yelp only to find they were closed or so busy that the wait was unreasonable. One night DLW wanted poke, but the place we chose was packed with a line out the door. A short distance away was this place, which was almost empty. That's usually a bad sign, but we had a good experience.  I guess we still had poke on the brain, since we had ceviche and salmon tartare, both of which were delightful, plus a nice endive salad. The patio where we sat was covered, and here's where our luck got better as a downpour came through. The staff scrambled to shore up the tarp over the passageway inside, and moved the tables out of harm's way as we sat safely dry. It probably wasn't much fun for them, but we appreciated it. Pretty pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"First, let me preface my review by saying that this restaurant is the latest addition to the Montreal restaurant scene, and has only been open for about 3 weeks. I typically wait a month or two before checking out a new place because the first couple of weeks are usually spent ironing out the bugs and perfecting dishes.  Location: In the heart of Old Montreal, on St. Paul West. Use transit or take a cab unless you want to spend the apperitivo portion of your night driving around aimlessly, looking for parking.   The space: I loved it! It's not too big and not too small, and reminds me of he 40s for some reason. It's beautifully decorated, has a great bar area and a beautiful terrace. Dimly light with great music, this place would make for a good date spot.   The food: I would love to report back with a 5-star review but it's just not going to happen. The concept here, is like many other restaurants in Montreal - tapas style dishes that are meant to be shared. Thus, the concept is neither original or exciting, especially when you've got a great place like Dolcetto right next door. These are the dishes we ordered:  Buttercup squash gnocchi with duck confit, walnuts, micro arugula and parmesan: Both my date and I loved this dish. It was incredibly flavorful, with doughy soft gnochhi that could easily melt in my mouth were it not for the sheer pleasure that  I took in chewing each delectable bite, one by one.   Scallop ceviche, avocado-jalapeno mousse, wild coriander and fresh lime: Again, this was another hit for both my date and I. The scallops were fresh, the avocado mouse was amazing and the combination of flavors just worked damn well. My only note on this dish is that there should have been more coriander, and less lime, as it was borderline vinegary.   Grilled  jumbo shrimp, smoked paprika, garlic flowers on white bean puree: This was a miss for me. First of all, the shrimp were nowhere near \"jumbo.\" Secondly, they lacked in flavor and were a little dry. Lastly, the bean puree didn't really taste like anything and there was no hint of garlic anywhere in sight.  Rabbit-stuffed beet cannelloni, wild mushrooms, aged cheddar, Pasito wine, Gorgonzola reduction: Absolute, total miss for me. I was looking forward to this dish but was extremely disappointed. I wish I could describe the flavor but I just can't. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I don't recall seeing or tasting any mushrooms or Gorgonzola  and well, the dish was just weird, not to mention TINY for the price. The cannelloni were more like large penne than cannelloni.   Bison short ribs, slow-cooked in wild spices, black beer marinade on sun-dried tomato polenta: Another miss. My date had to send this dish back because the meat was so tough, she couldn't even chew it. When the manager (or someone) came over, he actually said he didn't know if the problem was the cook time or the meat. Who says that? Anyway, after much confusion about ordering a new dish vs. getting a new order of ribs, a waiter randomly showed up with new ribs while we were looking at the menu for a replacement dish (as the manager or whoever, suggested). Communication is key here, people. The only up side is that the sauce was good, according to my date.  Price: NO. Yes, that's how I'm describing it. For the amount of food that you get per dish, these guys are overpriced. For example, those teeny tiny cannelloni (there were TWO) were about $15.  That was the average price per dish, which is ridiculous when I can walk over to Dolcetto, order more food (and a nicer quality) and probably pay about the same or less than this place. Not to mention that I was charged $6 for still water which is ridiculous. The majority of restaurants in Montreal don't charge for still water. Furthermore, if they do charge, they advise their clients in advance that the 'still' water is bottled, which did not happen with us. The up side? The glass of Pinot that I had was quite good and only cost $10.   Service: Our waitress was lovely and very friendly. She immediately removed the $6 water charge because we weren't advised of the cost when we ordered. That said, there were a hell of a lot of wait staff and bus boys on the floor for the number of patrons that were in the place. I felt like we were playing musical waiters, what with all the different people that came by our table in such a short period of time. Also, some of the wait staff (or bus boys - really couldn't tell the difference) looked constipated. Smile - it's free!   Verdict: Overall, not a bad experience, but I think the menu needs to be sorted out and the prices need to be adjusted. I'd be willing to give these guys another go in a few months to see if anything has changed. For now, though, I'll have to pass."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals we have ever had. Not sure why the negative reviews but we loved this place.  Service: Upscale establishment with upscale level service.  Could not have been better.  Ambiance: Huge energy.  A definitely hip spot.  Not good for business meetings or first date when you want to talk.  But we still had a conversation with great music and spectacular energy.  Great space with an excellent outdoor area.  Price: I didn't think the prices were unreasonable.  Not as high as NYC and I think maybe less than the upscale joints in Toronto.  Food: Fiancee had the bison which others here have slammed.  I can say that this was the best short rib I have ever tasted and the meat slid off the bone.  The sun dried tomato polenta was equally tasty. I had the sea bass which was prepared perfectly.  drizzle of olive oil and some cherry tomatoes.    We really enjoyed this place and would recommend it in an instant."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I was excited to try this new spot, I walked in and really loved how they revamped the place. Yet, my bad experience comes not from the delicious food, but from the most horrible service.  The waitress, probably a beginner, didn't know her menu at all. She was very sweet, but totally clueless. When you are advertising a new cool place, your staff needs to be awesome. The food took FOREVER to show up (40-45min) and we were told that they were short staffed. Yet, the busboy kept pacing back and forth in front of our seats doing nothing. Nothing was compensated for, everything had to be asked for twice (Is the food soon ready? Can we have the bill? etc.)  When you know you are short staffed and the service is slow, you try your best to compensate and give the best service you can. You can even pick up bucket of ice cream, put a scoop in a little silver platter with a little spoon, it will probably cost you about $50, give some to each person in the restaurant, and apologize.  Ice cream on us. Simple gestures that show that you care. Yet, nothing was done to apologizeÂ­ for the extremely long service.  Service is key. And despite your food, which was very good, I can't even bring myself to go back because of my most frustrating experience. I know you are just beginning, but to succeed in Old Montreal, you need great food AND great service.  Good luck..."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   Reservations were confirmed (3 times might I add) for 8:30 PM to then walk in and be told it was logged in for 10 PM. Spoke to the manager who then told us \"my hostess wouldn't lie to me\".  After waiting over an hour to be seated we were brought to the back area with a lovely terrace feel. Only to be waiting for another 30 min to order.   Got the food finally. 1) grilled octopus was the chewiest thing I've ever attempted to swallow 2) tuna carpaccio - tasteless and somewhat warm? 3) Fries - never knew someone could screw this up, but they weren't cooked (come on McDonald's can do better!) 4) Gnocchi - found a lovely piece of plastic in there yum extra protein! Told the waiter about this, he first offered us a new plate ... umm no thanks sort of lost my appetite. He then left. My friend then approached him about it, to be given attitude for bringing it up, classy.    Beautiful decor, lovely atmosphere, horrible customer service and terrible food. But don't think I'll ever step back in there unless they change management, staff and chef."}
{"text":"Quickly learned must make reservations weeks ahead of time for dinner in Montreal too!   Aimlessly walking around and looking for a quick dinner spot, as we were peering at the menu the manager was about to go in, said a quick hello to us and asked how many and invited us in to a table.    The interior was very romantic, a bit too low lit for my taste, but the decor was very pretty none the less.  Menu was not huge but had a nice variety of items to please everyone in our party of 5, even the 2 picky eaters.    Started with the Burrata with grilled peaches, arugula and walnut croutons: Creamy and fresh with a nice bite of sweet from the grilled peaches.  The Grilled Octopus was incredibly tender and flavorful with the paprika marinade; Beef Tataki was melt in your mouth delicious and  the scallop ceviche was very fresh and vibrant in taste.  We each ordered a main to share, The black cod had a nice balance of sweet and savory, cooked medium so still firm and silky all at once; the PEI lobster was quite sweet and tender and beautifully presented.  3 of us ordered the  Angus beef sirloin with bone marrow and herbed arugula...a bit of a disappointment...the sirloin was cooked to perfection for each of us but we were expecting a bone marrow bone.  Couldn't taste it anywhere nor see it anywhere on the plate...  Our server was very attentive and engaging and I don't ever remember our water glasses ever being empty either. He even took the liberty to split our bill 5 ways without any prompting.  Great dinner overall and am looking to go back again in the near future."}
{"text":"Not much to rave about this place.   Food presentation was bland. The food itself was ok. The only thing extraordinary about this place were the prices. $40 for about 4 ounces of bison meat. We sat outside and had nature's droppings landing in our glasses and our table.   I've had better dining experiences."}
{"text":"\"An elegant atmosphere when it needs to be with full featured bar and dining area. Performs well as a night spot but would be just as enjoyable during the day\"  Had a company event here where we held the entire venue. It's in a part of Old Montreal where there are countless other places like it but this place had some nice features. Full bar when you walk in, with good views and a dining area inside. I had a very nice lamb shank that was fall-off the bone and melt in your mouth. I wanted seconds, it was very tasty. Probably a good place for a little bit of an upscale lunch during regular business hours or a nice dinner.   Doubles as a lounge at night so may be a good atmosphere for that, but not big enough to host too many people."}
{"text":"Great surprise for me and my business partner. People are cool and service was impeccable. Food followed the good experience we had since arrival and a place to go i you're looking for a nice combination of dining and ambient."}
{"text":"Over all it's a great place dinning out. Decor is well done reminds me a little of Victorian style. Good selection of food on the menu and great selection of wines.  My reason for giving it 2 out of 5 is simple. This is the second time I go there and it's the same feeling I get. There is a constant feeling of trying to up sell. U can recommend choices but don't push it.  The next was the heating by the window, both times my guest and I noticed it was cold and a breeze coming in. It was brought to there attention and nothing was done, making the dinner unpleasant.  The last major issue which doesn't usually happens but when it does they should compensate was an error in the order.  They served the wrong dish and the price was considerably more. Nothing was done to compensate. We received the fish of the day at market price instead. A regular dish was 24.00 and this plate costed 40.00. Not only nothing g was done but we weren't even told the price until the bill came at the end.  As much as is like to rave about the quality of food unfortunately when there is no consideration for the customer in an industry of service I can just say compliments to the chef and shame on the management."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, service was attentive and food was good. I had the endive salad and truffle mac n cheese. So overall was a good experience BUT we had a reservation and while we were having our coffees after dinner the hostess came and told us we had to leave because of another reservation coming. We were there for less than an hour. That is rude as hell so no, not going back. Who goes out of their way to go to old Montreal to a restaurant to only get basically told to leave before they're even finished? And common sense would have it that when people are having their after dinner coffees that they'll most likely be out within 10-15 minutes. Forget this place.. there's a ton more in the area with similar decor, food and ambience."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and attended to by many of the staff who seemed to be milling about. Water, bread and drink orders taken right away. Questions about the menu answered. We order and are told the steak would take 30 minutes. Odd, but, okay, we'll order an appetizer, (scallops) which came in decent time and were very good. An hour after appetizer was eaten and cleared we still did not have our meal!  Not only did we not have our meal, we were not once told by our server what the issue was or that our meal was coming at some point. A little past the hour and a half mark our meals were served with a quick \"sorry\" from the server. The medium rare steak was medium to well done.  The gnocchi was edible but the lobster pieces were like chewing rubber. Of course when dessert was offered we declined even though dessert is my favorite part of any meal.  I just couldn't take the chance on waiting another 90+ minutes for that! We splurge on dinner out when we vacation and this was not the splurge we were hoping for. Oh, let me also mention Scarlet is so overpriced."}
{"text":"On y va seulement pour l'ambiance et pour la beautÃ© de la terrasse, sÃ»rement pas pour la nourriture plus qu'ordinaire et qui est chÃ¨re pour ce que nous mangeons."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a large group. Staff were hot and accommodating, food was excellent, atmosphere fantastic. Not sure why all the negative reviews to be honest."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Went in a group, general consensus was not to go here again. Waitresses were nice, food was low budget for high price. There's much better food to be had in old montreal."}
{"text":"We had company Christmas party in the restaurant. I ordered trout tartar for the appetizer and grilled chicken for my main course. Pros:  nice location in old port Nice decor Great food Good for groups Big wine selection  Cons: A little bit expensive"}
{"text":"Great place with lively crowd and music. Great ambiance and food. Excellent service. We were sitting in one of their VIP booths last night and found evetmrythi g to be just perfect for my dads 70th birthday party."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I don't really remember what I ate here. It was late and we had been at the W bar right before going. What I do remember is walking by and thinking: \"this looks like a great place to eat!\" I also remember that the ambiance was ideal for a 10pm dinner - elegantly decorated but not gaudy, lavish but not ostentatious.   I feel like we ordered some kind of salad, and maybe the octopus? There was definitely something else but I'm struggling to remember what. Regardless, the plates were clean by the time we were done, so that must mean something. Oh, and they had a stellar selection of signature cocktails. Pretty sure mine had mint in it.   Anyhow, long story short, this is probably a good place to go, but I unfortunately can't remember much about it. Try it out and let me know what to you think!"}
{"text":"Not wow. I came here with a group of 8 girls who were not very hungry, most of them ordered side dishes, but of the main dishes we ordered were the seafood risotto and the steak. It was nothing special for the price presented. I was expecting large pieces of seafood in the risotto, but I got a medium sized plate with one shrimp in it. The steak was average. The mashed potatoes were the best thing I had honestly.   The decor is lovely but the music is too loud, we had to yell to hear each other.   All in all, not the best experience. You can find better food at a more intimate atmosphere for the same price, if not cheaper. Why should I pay 24 dollars for a plate with one shrimp and tiny pieces of seafood, and that consists almost entirely of rice?"}
{"text":"Had a great time once again last night. The black cod is simply delicious . Also tried the gnocchi. Great food with a great vibe."}
{"text":"First time to Montreal. Just walked in off of the street and were accommodated. Had tuna carpacchio to start, Guinea Hen, and duck for dinner, lemon tart for dessert. Everything was delicious and service was great. I read the complaints about price:portions. I actually enjoyed the portions. A nice break from the gluttony of American restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a very cool restaurant in the old port. The atmosphere is exceptional. And the terrasse outside is beautiful! Ask to sit there if the weather permits.  They leave a bottle of water on your table.  The service is also great. There are many people constantly checking on you.  The food portions are on the small side but very delicious! I got the sea bass and recommend it.  Prices are on the high end.  Very good place for a special date."}
