{"text":"Boy ole boy, this placed opened up recently and I have been back a few times to try out the menu and its all good. Amir is from Lebanon and does it all that way, with great salads and really good shawarma in beef and chicken. Try the kibbies too, wow."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a quick lunch - great to know there is another shawarma option in Markham (there are not many). Overall the meal was great, however the shawarma may have been too packed, and I was glad I was eating this with a plate in front of me. 

Great service and some very interesting menu options I have not seen before like the Shawarma poutine. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and very inexpensive. I had the Shift Kafta with Tabouli and Hummus. The Tabouli was okay, definitely fresh, just not for me, but the Hummus was some of the best I've had and they give you a lot of pita bread to go with it."}
{"text":"Because of all the rave reviews, I went and give it a try. I ordered a beef shawarma plate ($12.99) and a lamb shish kebob wrap(around $8). Have to say it's just a below average place for shawarma. The beef was dry and hard. The rice is dry and oily. The wrap only three small pieces of lamb and it was loose and nothing much in there. 

For the price I paid, it definitely not worth it. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken shawarma!

Shawarma Stop has been a lunch spot of mine since it opened. Always fast service, fresh ingredients, and delicious food. Despite long lines at lunch, the well crafted food prep assembly line by the owner and his team move through dozens of patrons in minutes.

I always get the chicken shawarma wrap with everything on it except hot sauce. Sometimes a little hot sauce when I'm feeling up to it. The meat, veggies, and sauces are all top quality. They move through so much shaved chicken at lunches that it's always fresh and moist.

I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. It's one of the best shawarma places in the GTA, and you'll be hooked after one visit!"}
{"text":"First time here. Will definitely come back. Family restaurant, generous portions, and very friendly which is becoming more rare. Got the Shawarma salad and it was very filling."}
{"text":"The food is fairly cheap and delicious. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate with two sides of hummus and tabouli, and I was not disappointed! Everything tastes authentic. I definitely recommend coming here. Also, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best food in town. Got beef shawarma and kafta 10/10
Also tried falafel fresh never frozen. 
Best prices $3.75 a sandwich."}
{"text":"Good service, good people and good food. A tad overpriced but I do not mind since the food tastes so good."}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma place! My boyfriend and I just moved to Richmond Hill and I was super bummed that there was no good shawarma place until a friend told me about his gem! The food is amazing all the time (which says a a lot because our old place was hit or miss) and the staff is so friendly! Also reasonably priced and great portions! Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Felt like having shawarma for a qick meal Friday night and found this place on Yelp.  The chicken plate was amazing and delicious!  The owner was also friendly and pleasant to deal with.  So glad we found this place, will definitely come back often!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the owner is very congenial. Ate lunch and came back for dinner later, it was that good. Baklava is a good way to finish the meal."}
{"text":"Went by for a quick lunch stop, grabbed a chicken Sharma wrap.  Unfortunately took one bite in car whole wrap meat and everything was pure cold.  Ive been to a lot of Mid East places and should have know what to expect when I was being served.  Chicken was pre cut off spit and sitting on stove , first mistake. Second, guy put the wrap in toaster press while I was paying no more then 5 seconds.  My pita was cold not even toasted.  If I was not in a rush I would have went back in to complain. Oh well lost future customer. End rant. Ty"}
{"text":"Very hard to find good shawarma in Markham. Luckily, found this place! Had the chicken shawarma plate ($11.99 + tax) - includes lots of chicken, rice, salad, pickled veggies, potatoes, hummus, pita bread. I like how they give you lots of sauce, yum! I must say, they give you A LOT of food :) Overall, the food is delicious and fresh. They keep the place very clean and it looks like it is a family-run business. The owners are super nice and are always smiling. As a shawarma lover, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Fresh meat and veggies. Family owned . Try their sauces . All homemade and amazingly delicious. Fast and friendly service. Super clean. Must try this place and  you'll get hooked.  Not just any other shawarma place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even more amazing service. The owner was so kind and let us try soo many different dishes 
We got great recommendations and loved everything we ate. Definitely would suggest this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the wife for the first time as i drive by it all the time. Tough to find a good shwarma place in Markham but this place rocks! I had the chicken shwarma platter and it was the closest thing i have had in toronto that resembled my fav Halal Guys from nyc. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The owner was nice and friendly and took the time to put a vegetarian plate together for my wife. Definitely will return time an time again."}
{"text":"You must try a chicken shawarma here asap. A shwarma is grilled chicken inside of a pita and it is healthy and tasty. This is an authentic Lebanese restaurant with great service and fresh ingredients.  You must try the garlic spread called \"toom\".  Americans who have spent time in the Middle East will find this place a real treat."}
{"text":"Lovely people. The food quality is great but only made better by the guest experience. Really makes you wish there were more small businesses around like this."}
{"text":"I just stopped by today to try this place... I ordered their Kofta, which I am a sucker for... and honestly, this is the kind of taste I've been looking for in a Kofta kabob since i miss the place that I went to in Los Angeles. Its fresh and not dry and over done.  Their Shawarma is good as well.. But he has this garlic sauce that is sooooo good put on everything!!!! Baba ganoush was good and fresh and not from the can... The hummus was a bit grainy and not too smooth but the after taste is a lot better than the other places that serve creamier  hummus.  

Its really a small place, but I DEFINITELY would go back for my Kofta and garlic sauce!!!
You got to try that date pressed cookie that the owner makes.  It's really good and has a hint of sweetness to it... Its not too sweet..."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in the GTA! I've been here multiple times and it is always awesome. Fresh, spit cooked meats, fresh pitas, and fresh veggies! Personaly I have been so dissapointed by shawarmas in Toronto I had given up until I came here! I will put these up against any shawarma in the city and the value is superb! Keep up the great work and product!"}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma. This place ruined me for all other shawarma places. Now any other shawarma I eat tastes like shit. To top it all off, the owners are so amazing, kind and nurturing. I feel like they could heal me of any disease with their food. I'm serious. On our anniversary, my husband asked me to name a restaurant, any restaurant, I chose this place. LOL. I hope I don't over hype it but seriously, you haven't lived until you try this place. You'll never go to any other shawarma place. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma is not fresh, they prep everything an hour or two prior to lunch hour rush. The sauce was too overwhelming. The fries were mediocre of course ketchup helped."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. 

I normally order the chicken shawarma plate. Great portions, tasty food, and friendly family staff (mom and pa team)

Decor could use some work but needless to say. A must for shawarma north of Toronto.  
 
A friend told me to try the pouting shawarma. That's next in my food bucket list to eat. 

This place is going to make me fat !!"}
{"text":"Just returned form a long business leg and was craving shawarma , couldn't find anything decent anywhere in the south east . I landed and went directly to my favorite place where the owner knows my name and most of the staff too . Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The shawarma and kibbeh are both excellent and you can't beat the price! I'll will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My new go-to for Shwarma. The hummus and baba-ganoush were excellent. Had to try the baklava as well and loved it. I've been driving by this place for a month and finally convinced myself to stop. It's rather small and the menu is limited, but I think sticking with what you do best is really a good plan for them. If you're looking for Shwarma, this is the place to stop."}
{"text":"Good shawarmas! That's why this place is always packed with people in line during lunch hours so it's expected that there is some wait. It's not too bad when you go with someone to kill time with, but don't grab a village of people when you're already hungry to add more to your suffering. 

Food is good. Ingredients are fresh. People are friendly and polite! The owners are the ones who smile at you like your own parents. However, the price is on the high side from $8.99 to 10.99 a shawarma, not what real parents would do. But since they're not your real parents, they do what they need to feed you :) 

There are better and cheaper places in Scarborough and Toronto for $5 bucks a shawarma. But because we're not in Scarborough, I guess we're paying more for the location and the only shawarma establishment in Markham."}
{"text":"Portions were alright for the price, measured out with a scale. About 200g of rice and beef for the beef shawarma plate. Which means they cooked about 1lb of beef raw. The box looked larger than it was. 200g of beef and rice is really just a small bowl of each. I saw certain people getting much larger portions of food than others. They didn't get the extra meat either, so it's hit or miss. Also I asked for beef but they gave me chicken. They did change it but left about half the meat as chicken at the bottom. Pretty much paid for beef and got half chicken which is cheaper. 

Meat was alright in terms of tenderness, and sauces made the dish very flavourful. Without the sauce the dish is dry, but that's why you get the sauce. 

$15 with tax for a beef shawarma plate which had rice&potatoes, beef and salad with vinaigrette. Plus hummus or tahini sauce on the side and bread. I think $12-$13 after tax would have been a fair price. It was $13-$14 before tax, no drink included. You can't blame them, it looked family owned. With the new minimum wage of $14, soon to be $15, you expect prices to sky rocket. I still gave them a tip, as I know how hard it is to start a business and keep it profitable. Maybe they can offer a drink with the price. As canned pop/bottled water is really only 20cents to 30cents a can/bottle, when it's bought from the grocery store. I will say, I was able to eat this meal throughout 3 meals. Although I have an extremely small food capacity. 

I will say it's extremely healthy, the meal probably was 500-700 calories total (depending how much sauce you want to use). Although you could get something similar at chipotle (a bowl) for much cheaper and it has more ingredients. There was NO OIL, NO GREASE, which I actually like. Unfortunately dude to that the food was really dry, but if you're dieting or are following a low fat diet then it would be good.

I probably won't be returning anytime soon unless a friend invites me. Just because it's cheaper to eat elsewhere with similar portions, great taste and quality of food. I will come back when I need a healthy quick meal."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma.. glad this placed opened up since there really aren't many comparable options around Hwy 7/404. You will not leave this place hungry; my wife and I ordered the lamb shish kabob plate and the chicken shawarma poutine.. OMG, haven't had anything like it anywhere! Flavor was spot on, got it with some hot sauce and garlic sauce on the side. Lamb was also delicious, grilled to order and well-seasoned with rice, potatoes, side of salad and hummus and eggplant.

Restaurant was also very clean, including the prep counter which is rare to find..  the owner was also very friendly!"}
{"text":"My very first meal in Tempe was right here at the Shawarma Stop. I had the combo shawarma with the saffron rice and fries, and it was SO UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS. I also had this drink in a can with a name that I can't remember right now, but it had black currant in it and it was super tasty too. This place, man! I can't recommend it highly enough. Quite an excellent first choice if I do say so myself."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken poutine which I thought was OK. I didn't get the extras like garlic sauce or mixed meat because they charge extra for it. It is a very large portion even for two people."}
{"text":"Great shawarma place across from First Markham Place. Shared the shawarma plate & shawarma poutine. 

Serving size was good and very filling. The place is family run and the couple there was busy running around the whole time making food with people coming in small waves around 7 or 8pm. One thing was they never put the garlic sauce and hot sauce on the poutine - that probably would've made it a lot better. Other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for shawarmas as I consider it as a comfort food.  I'm happy to see another shawarma place along Highway 7 because, as others have said, there's simply too few in the area.  

Shawarma Stop is in the plaza with Blinds to Go, a small plaza with tons of parking.  Space is very clean and bright and thankfully a TV in the corner.  Came here after missing dinner one night and was really hungry, portions are pretty big and they seem very eager to pack the shawarma with a lot of meat.  I've only tried chicken and it was definitely above average.  Otherwise, the fries were a bit lacking - it's not as fried and crispy as i'd like.  Maybe it would be better as poutine.

Owner was very friendly and chatted with us a little (though it wasn't a very busy night).  Looking forward to coming by again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Shawarma place. The staff/owner there always greet me with a great big smile. Even this is a take out type of restaurant with no wait staff, the limited seating area is kept neat and clean. Generous portions are always given on the Shawarma plates. Shawarma wraps are always neatly wrapped in a way that it rarely falls apart, no mess, and the flavour is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Heard it was good from here so I went. Around 9, they out the fresh shawarma away. Nice owners, however the meat was old and dry. And there was a long hair in my food, definitely not mine as it's was curly and dark. Yuck. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Everything was incredible! So much flavor! I brought a friend who had never had Lebanese food before, we ordered a little of everything. Couldn't have picked a more perfect place for his first Shwarma experience. They were out of Fattoush and the owner/chef made more just so we could try it! My favorite was the Shish Kafta Sandwich. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite to eat, but I've had better Shawarma elsewhere. The flavours were on the milder side, and the salad in the plate was not what I was expecting at all being cabbage and coleslaw rather than lettuce. The \"mom\" got my order wrong when I said \"please nothing spicy on the Chicken shawarma plate\" and she proceeded to not give me anything spicy on all plates. It was a takeout order and you can imagine my disappointment when I got home and had to resort to adding Sirracha just to give it some spice. 

On top of that, I think I got overcharged because the prices on the board  (+hst) did not add up to the total I paid. I was in a rush and did not do the mental math beforehand nor did I turn back. 

On the plus side, their falafel is excellent! Their baclava is not overly sweet, which is good if you're watching your sugar intake. 

All in all, an \"okay\" meal if you're in the area, but if you're craving for good Shawarma I would recommend you make the drive to your favourite joint."}
{"text":"Good portion with lots of rice me chicken. Looks like it's a family run restaurant. I always like their chicken shawarma plate and will always come here for more."}
{"text":"If there was more than 5 stars I'd give them the highest, I'm here eating entree plate, chicken shawarma, hummus and baba ghanouj , tahini and garlic sauce. Amir even let me try their salad , food so good serving is a lot for an unbelievably low price that I feel bad for paying small amount of money for such good food. A must try and bookmarked"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Such delicious food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is unreal! 

I've had my fair share of shawarma, if anyone has ever been to Hamilton - you'll know they have shawarma shops on every corner. And as a shawarma lover, I've tried them all. So when one popped open in Markham, I had to try it. 

So authentic, from the beef and chicken skewers to the pickled beets and pickles. This place is delicious. 

My fiancé got the beef shawarma platter and I got the chicken shawarma poutine. We ended up sharing because we wanted to try it all. The beef shawarma platter was so good, it came with beef, rice, potatoes, humus, a side salad, a pita and a generous portion of the white garlic sauce and the red hot sauce. Drool. The chicken shawarma poutine came with chicken, fries, cheese curds (yes, not shredded cheese), and gravy. I asked for some white garlic sauce and the server happily complied. It was incredible. We ate and ate and ate until I was reminded I have to fit into my wedding dress this year, then I ate one more huge serving before I stopped. 

Honestly, if you're on the fence, check it out. Nothing fancy, but great, quick, shawarma. Totally work the stop in, lunch and dinner - my only regret - can't pick up a breakfast shawarma before I head into work. Give it a try. Can't speak about how much I love this enough!"}
{"text":"So good. This is one of my go to for lunch. I love their food and the service is amazing. Falafel are made fresh to order and they are super tasty."}
{"text":"Great family run shawarma joint in Markham. Not many shawarma places in the area so this one is definitely a life saver. Reasonable prices and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma and loved it.  I don't like anything with peas so hummus was out of the question for me so the proprietor recommended two other sides and they were very tasty.  The portions were large enough for two.  The service was great and the price was very reasonable.  I will be coming back and bringing my hubby along!"}
{"text":"I got the combo shawarma and I was not disappointed! Don't let the simple decor fool you, this place is amazing. The service was warm and welcoming and my food was super flavorful."}
{"text":"Great shawarma, recommend the chicken and kafta!! Their homemade sweets are amazing. Takes me back home :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and most importantly great hospitality. Family owned and operated business. Owners really care about how you like the food and will adjust sandwich to how you like it. I would definitely come back and recommend to other people."}
{"text":"My new go-to shawarma place in Markham!

Owner is very friendly, always smiling, always accommodating to your requests.  Family owned business.

I've had their chicken shawarma, very nice.  But my favorite has to be their lamb shawarma; the meat is so moist and tender!  One thing to note for the lamb shawarma:  They insists on made to order for the lamb (which is worth the wait), so will only put it on the grill after you've ordered, nothing ready-made.  So if you have about 10 minutes to chillax, then try their lamb!"}
{"text":"the best shawarma and flavored rice I had in a long time. All the sauces taste great. Friendly owner/chef! A must go!"}
{"text":"Amazing shawarmas!!! I ordered the chicken and beef pittas. Both were delicious. The pita was packed full of fresh vegetables and the sauces were so good. Their plates looked amazing too and big portions!! The two people serving us were really nice and always smiling.  Great value and tasty food.  The parking lot is a bit cramped and it could get worse depending what time of day you go but I have never had a problem finding parking.  All in all a great place to get your shawarma fix!"}
{"text":"Amir rocks! Great baba ghanouj!!! Kafka was very good too. Just off the light rail on Apache so ver convenient."}
{"text":"Good value, and service is very friendly. I have only had the falafel and chicken shwarma - both were good.  Not busy at night either."}
{"text":"Great customer service, the owners are very friendly. Their falafel is fluffy, well-seasoned and portioned generously."}
{"text":"This place is great for a good fast meal. The place does not look warm, but the food is delicious. I got good suggestions and was served with great energy. I got a shawarma platter and it was delicious. A lot for a good price. Love their garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Please bring a friend because the shawarma poutines here are of ridiculous portion sizes! I'm not saying you can't finish it on your own, I'm saying you really shouldn't..! This is definitely a place I'm sure many people would consider as their \"guilty pleasure\" because it opens late in Markham (wow, so rare!) and offers one of the best comfort foods for sad nights, hangovers, and just downright cravings.

I can't say the meat was the most succulent tender meat I've had, but I mean, at that time of the night, do you even really care? Along with the delicious sauce and the hot crisp fries, the combination of it all just puts you into a trance where you can't stop enjoying yourself and hating yourself at the same time. Woohoo for poutines!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had at such an exceptional value. The owner is very kind as well. Do not skip out on trying their food! :)"}
{"text":"Great shawarma place in Markham!

I ordered the shawarma poutine and asked for half chicken and half beef ($9.99). This is by far the largest serving of poutine I have ever eaten with generous amount of meat! Freshly fried fries that was crispy, topped with cheese curd, generous amount of gravy, followed by loads of shawarma and finally topped with more gravy! I also asked for garlic sauce on top to kick it up a notch. The flavour worked really well together - it was crispy, cheesy, saucy and savoury all at the same time. It really hits the spot for some good comfort food. They were very generous with the portions as they did not skimp out on the meat - the proportion of the meat was almost more than the fries! Definitely can be shared amongst 2 people. I prefer the chicken over the beef and will probably order just the chicken shawarma poutine in the future. 

I also ordered the gyro wrap which wasn't anything outstanding - probably will stick with chicken.

You must add the garlic sauce (and maybe hot sauce) to give it that extra flavour and to balance the saltiness of the gravy.
Very friendly service and this spot has adequate amount of sitting space. 
Definitely a place I'm going back to!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is the place to be if you're craving some good shwarma. Oftentimes, I will go during lunch hours, and the place would be packed because that's just how good the food is. The place serves a variety of Middle Eastern meals, and all the ones I've tried delicious! Service wise, all the staff are very friendly and attentive to your order, and they really don't skim out on the meat.

Both the beef and chicken shwarma wraps/plates are very flavourful, and portion size are pretty big for the price. They did recently increase the price of their menus items, which is understandable considering how popular they are. I highly recommend the shwarma poutine as well, as they fry the fries per order.

Highly recommend this place to anyone craving a good shwarma meal in Markham."}
{"text":"Finally another place for shawarma in the west side of Markham. Aside from Pitalicious which no longer opens on weekends there pretty much aren't any other options for shawarma in the area so this is a welcome addition. 

Tried the chicken shawarma wrap, a falafel wrap, and a chicken shawarma plate. Both the chicken shawarma wrap and plate were great. Portions for both were generous and the chicken was nice and moist. They are not shy with the tahini and garlic sauce so if you like your shawarma like that then this is the place for you! Thankfully that's exactly how I like my mine so I loved every bite of it. 

The big surprise for me though were the falafels. They are fried to order which is always a good sign (never trust a shawarma place that doesn't do this!) but there was something about these falafels that made them taste soo good. I don't know what seasonings or 11 secret herbs and spices that this place puts in theirs that other places don't but the falafels here are just way more flavourful and were some of the best I've had in a long time. 

Prices are average but the staff is friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in yorkregion. Had the chicken shawarma and the shawarma poutine. Amazing!  Such a huge serving and prices are very good. Three of us shared the poutine and we weree all stuffed. Shawarma is 6.99 and poutine was 11$. Great deal, quality and service"}
{"text":"THE BEST I've had in the GTA. Super friendly service with a genuine love for their customers.  Love the Beef Shawarma and the Poutine... Excellent flavour and very generous portions. 
A Definite must try!! A++"}
{"text":"This place is unassuming but the food is anything but.  I have been there several times and their food is consistently fresh, and it is delicious, it has a unique style from other shawarma spots.  I talked to the owner and it was obvious to me he takes great pride in the food he serves, but I didn't need to hear it from him because the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite shawarma spot in all of Markham. The quality of food is great, generous serving with amazing service. Recommended a must try as I would not blink twice coming here for shawarma."}
{"text":"Been craving shawarma for a while and just happen to see this on yelp. Definitely not a known business but it was the best beef shawarma I've ever had. The prices are really good too. Definitely going to become a regular lol"}
{"text":"Great chicken shawarma wrap! Lots of flavour, not greasy, good meat and veg ratio. packed pita for $7.90 that's quite filling!
Fast service too!"}
{"text":"Finding a good shawarma place in Richmond Hill ain't easy! II'll be straight up, I love my shawarma place in Scarborough, but have dined there so many times, need a new experience. First off, this needs to be recognized: owners are very polite and welcoming! Customer service top marks here. Dining room is very clean, no complaints. 

We ordered a chicken shawarma plate for $11.99 plus taxes. A little on the high side than my other places? Slightly, but for Hwy 7 it's a decent price considering the surrounding expensive eateries nearby. Their plates come with some potatoes, salad, tahini, & garlic sauce with a nice warm pita that was very soft! 

Their poutines look very fine, something that I will definitely try in the future."}
{"text":"Lunch is really busy. I went in at 1:10 and left at 1:45. The wait is about half an hour, but they move as quick as I can. 

For some reason, I'm not super satisfied with the taste of the Chicken Shawarma Wrap today - something felt missing. I think the hot sauce was not very spicy. It was really big and filling though - definitely not something you want to eat in the car, or without a drink. 

I ordered everything in it. They have options such as lettuce, radish, cucumbers(!!!), onions and tomatoes. 

I think it was fairly reasonable for what it is - it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Oh Shawarma Stop, why do you have to torture me? The entire drive where I had to endure the smell of your take-out in my car was unbearable. The contents were a brown mess afterwards as I hit every swerve like I was straight out of 2 Fast 2 Furious 2 Hungry. But what a delicious brown mess it was. 

Sitting under a plain, arial font sign, in a small plaza off a busy street, is this humble little joint. It's timeless in a no frills kinda way; it could've been a store from the 80s or 90s. However, where it lacks in decor, Shawarma Stop blows you away with, yes, its shawarmas. Who can argue with HUGE portions of delicious Middle Eastern food? The wraps are the size of a baby. The plates can feed several starving children. 

Size doesn't count if the food's not good so I'm pleased to say the food here justifies the imminent face stuffing. The chicken is juicy, the falafels are tasty, the wraps are toasty, and the rice is fragrant. Their sauces (garlic, hummus, tahini) and sides (veggies, pickles) are perfect compliments to the meat and carbs. They've also got boxes of baklava off to the side. Tempting, but never tried. This is the kind of quality only achievable by people who love what they do and the family that runs this place definitely puts love into every bite. Even the french fries are fresh fried!

In conclusion, here are some situations that Shawarma Stop is perfect for: 
1) Coming out of LA Fitness next door and needing your protein gains, bro. 
2) You need a balanced meal, but you also need one hand to do stuff. Like type, or drive, or threaten someone who owes you money. 
3) Your GF says \"I don't know\" when you ask her what she wants to eat, but you know she's trying to stay healthy and you're trying not to spend your rent money on food. 
4) It's after 8pm which means it's your toddler's bedtime and apparently also Markham's bedtime because EVERYTHING is closed. 
5) Other.

{"text":"The shop is in a plaza beside highway 7 and it's definitely worth the drive - since I don't live anywhere near here. I was recommended by a friend. The staff is really nice and the shawarma was really delicious.

I feel as if they didn't skimp on the toppings either and the sauces were quite tasty. The prices are pretty affordable, so if you're craving for shawarma, I suggest checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"This place was way below average.

Ordered the chicken shawarma plate for ~$15 and shared it w/ the gf.

After reading all of these Yelp reviews, I thought that I was in for a delicious meal. I was wrong. The shawarma was lukewarm and very sparse compared to the heaping of rice and potatoes they gave us.

I consider myself an avid shawarma eater - eating it multiple times per week during my university days in London. There's no comparison b/w London shawarma and what I just ate at this establishment.

Sadly, I will look elsewhere to satisfy my shawarma needs."}
{"text":"My goodness I love this place. 
Fresh, filling, and has that authentic mom and pop shop feel. 

Can't go wrong with chicken shawarma and if you're feeling extra hungry or just hungover order yourself a shawarma poutine. These are two things that BE.
LONG together folks. The combination of flavours is to die for."}
{"text":"I love this place! Our go-to shawarma place in Markham. Generous portions of meat and fresh veggies. The husband & wife who own it are very friendly and polite. Highly recommend this place for a quick bite!"}

{"text":"Fast, friendly service, delicious shawarmas!

Got the beef shawarma and it was really good! A must-try! Huge serving and beef's delicious.

We also ordered a hamburger and it was pretty standard. Takes a while to make though, but that's alright.

Would come back again if I'm in the area. Lots of seating and can watch TV while dining in.

{"text":"This is a great little Shawarma Stop in the vicinity of the buttonville airport. Family owned and operated, the food (or at least the chicken shawarma) is always tasty and never dry.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it gets absolutely swamped during lunch hour (from about noon to 1pm), so be prepared to stand in line for up to 15 minutes.

This is my go-to lunch stop."}
{"text":"Delicious food made by lovely family, there meat is alwayse fresh and hot, very healthy choices of veggies. 
live in pickering and its worth the drive .. 

 5 stars for service and food."}
{"text":"While the location of the restaurant is a bit awkward, I love the food and it is very affordable! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Came here with a few friends looking to try something new and it was excellent. I'm not a huge meat person, but the chicken was delicious! It's a little hole in the wall place that I was skeptical about at first, but again, food was amazing. Very cheap and filling too!"}
{"text":"Had the falafel wrap which was tasty but stingy on the falafel. About 1/3 of my wrap was just veggies with no falafel to be found. Once I finally got to the falafel it was very enjoyable. 

Also tried their stuffed grapes leaves which were lacking in flavour and really greasy on the outside.

Ordered a regular poutine which was just average - not worth the price of $7.75 + tax.

A falafel wrap, chicken shawarma wrap, 4 grape leaves and a regular poutine came to just under $28."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Prices, Good Service!

So far I tried the following items:

Combo Shawarma Plate: My favorite Lebanese food and strongest recommendation for anytime.... With Shawarma it seems like you just cannot go wrong... tasty tasty!

Shish Kafta Plate: Good Plate of food.... hamburger meat wig rice and sauce....

Baba Ghanonj: Tasty dipping goodness to smother your entree in! Good flavor!

Lebanese Salad: great side to go with anything. Happy fresh taste!

The prices are affordable with gyros starting at only $4.25 each!
Dinner plates starting at $8.45

The owner and younger man are both super friendly and positive. 

We will definitely be back here for more!"}
{"text":"You are the solution to all my fears, doubts, and misfortunes.
You are the foundation from which I construct. The floor beneath my anchor.
Thank you for being a part of my life shawarma.

I feel pretty bad physically after I indulge in too many shawarma platters, but I can live with that."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like the food here. I passed by it so many times after grocery shopping across the street, but never at the right time to grab some lunch or dinner.  I was a bit disappointed to say the least. the portions are great, food is fresh, but the flavours just didn't hit close to home for me. The chicken was too dry and not seasoned the way shawarma should taste and the rice, well, the grains were so thin that i couldn't tell i was eating rice. The tahini was watery and not very flavourful and the garlic sauce just tasted like yogurt. For me great shawarma is freshly sliced. Not sliced and then reheated on a flat top. That's where they lost me. 

My chicken shawarma plate came with chicken, rice, salad (coleslaw/cabbage salad?!? - big no no!), hummus & baba ganoush (the only thing i truly enjoyed with the pita my meal came with). 

I've been to several middle eastern & mediterranean restaurants for shawarma. When you walk in it should be the first thing you smell especially when you can see it cooking on the spit behind the counter. When they slice it you should see the juice of the meat or the chicken. At Shawarma Stop i didn't even see them slice the chicken, it was already on the flat top. I still gave it a chance thinking that the flavours would be there. 

The owner & his wife are very nice, pleasant people. It seems to be busy in there and their portions are big, so i can see why they are busy. Doesn't matter to me how busy a place is or how big the portions are, if the flavours are not there, i wont be back."}
{"text":"Shawarma Stop can be difficult to find, but it is worth it!  The owner as also the chef and he makes some KILLER Lebanese grub!  Everything is made fresh right there in front of you.  I eat a lot of Middle Eastern food and this right up there with the best!  If you like good quality Middle Eastern you must check this place out.  Also, very good prices!

Check Them Out!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for shawarma in Markham!  Very happy to have found it.  The combo is a great value!  You will be sure to leave full! Pro tip: ask for the baba ganoush!  The lunch crowd tends to come in around 12:30 so come early!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on Friday 12/16/16 based off the Yelp reviews and I'm so happy I decided to come here for lunch. I got the chicken schwarma plate and it was delicious! The rice was cooked perfectly with great seasoning and great portions. You get two sides with the plates and a good piece of Arabian bread. I was offered another piece for no additional charge! The guy working there was super nice and had my lunch ready in no time. I hope they get more business with the construction that will be happening on Apache Blvd. I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great meal at a fair price. I plan on returning for many more amazing meals!"}
{"text":"So Fresh, very generous portions, & very friendly service! Whether you go in the afternoon, evening, or night this place is always busy and that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"My favourite middle eastern shawarma restaurant. I got the kafta dinner and the portions are amazing. For $11.99 I got two skewers of meat with rice potatoes salad and a bunch of sauce. Love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent no-frills Lebanese food.  This was a great find.  The chicken, beef, falafel and most importantly, the toum(!), were all excellent and authentic.  The owner was very friendly and he can cook!  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food amazing!!! Great portions!! There are a lot of options to choose from!
I would say this is the number one shawarma place in the area... Great customer service and amazing food make me want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was good, but there was something about their shawarma plate that didn't quite make it into the category of excellent. I feel like I have slightly better food of this type in other places. Still very good though. I wish that they didn't use styrofoam containers if you're eating in."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch! I tried the chicken shawarma and it was juicy and tender. I'd rather they perfect the sandwich for me though as opposed to me selecting what ingredients and sauces I want. I prefer to just eat."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel wrap for 7$ this time around and the wrap is huge. However, the overall flavour just wasn't there from the falafel to the veggies, it seems to be missing some ingredients that other shawarma shops"}
{"text":"The place needs some major cleaning. The tables are so dirty and unsanitary. The food was ok but it took a while to prepare it.

The guy helping us was very nice and respectful."}
{"text":"A must try! After my last visit at my local Shawarma spot (Tasty Shawarma) was a disappointment, I was on the hunt for another Shawarma place to fulfill my cravings. 

After seeing some great reviews on Yelp, we decided to check out Shawarma Spot. It was pretty busy on a Tuesday afternoon, but most of their seating almost filled. You can tell it was family operated and everyone greeted us with a smile. We decided to go with the Chicken Shawarma Poutine $9.99 with garlic sauce, and a Falafel Wrap $5.99. I love the variety of toppings here, and everything looked and tasted super fresh! The Chicken Shawarma Poutine was incredible and they certainly did not skimp on the chicken. There was more chicken than fries. 

The Falafel wrap was great too, the freshness and crunchiness of the veggies were yummy with the crispy Falafels. The family that owns this place are super friendly and they thank everyone when they leave as well! Such amazing customer service, and delicious food as well, 5+ stars!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the wraps they offer here. The wrap itself has a nice toasty texture and it's sturdy to hold all the lovely meat and veggies fillings. 
I get everything like those tiny picked beets and regular pickles. 

Best is the service thought. I think it's owned by a couple and they are the friendliest people!! 

Definitely a solid spot"}
{"text":"I am Lebanese and the food here is as delicious as my grandmother, Najeeba's!  The hummus is beyond amazing!  Fresh Food and the prices are ridiculously excellent. Family owned and operated with daughter at register and dad cooking! Excellent service, super friendly. There is no better Lebanese food in the state."}
{"text":"Best prices in town for Arab food! The quality is amazing! Everything hand made in the restaurant. I got the combo shawarma plate. It came with rice, salad, hummus, and fries. Everything I got was very tasty and filling. Also get the Saleh sauce if you like spicy food. Owner is very hospitable and friendly and makes sure you feel welcome. I wish this place the best of success!"}
{"text":"The first thing my mom and I noticed when we came in was how friendly and courteous the owners are! We ordered chicken shish kabob and beef shawarma plates to go. Since the chicken shish kabob is made fresh to order, the man serving us was considerate enough to let us know that he would prepare our beef shawarma plate later so it wouldn't get cold while we waited for them to make the chicken shish kabobs and invited us to sit down. My dad couldn't stop raving about how tasty the chicken shish kabobs were and my mom and I felt the same about the beef shawarma. The portions were also quite large and a good value for the price and each plate comes with pita bread, rice and salad. They even gave us extra garlic sauce upon request. My family definitely plans on coming back here and I'd definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had a chicken shawarma poutine here that was quick to get and super fresh. It was a very large portion for the price and everyone behind the counter was so nice. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegetarian options but I hear everyone who eats meat loves it here! The falafel plate was good. It came with 5 crispy falafels that were soft on the inside and definitely tasted good! The hot sauce, garlic and tahini sauce gave flavour to the rice as well as the hummus. The salad was good as well but I didn't like the dressing they used. Not bad, but not a place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure. A little hard to realize where it is but easy once you know. I had the hummus with chicken and pita. It was delicious. Great flavor to the chicken, very fresh and authentic style hummus."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!  I was wondering for ages why the parking lot was so crowded these days and when I walked into here on a Friday at lunch,  I understood where all the people were going.  Best shawarma I've probably ever had.  Super fast and friendly service.  There seem to be a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant. We arrived at 12:15 and there were 30 people in line. Now that I've tasted the food, I know exactly why. This is probably the best shawarma sandwich I've had and it sets the bar high. Portions are massive and heir prices are reasonable. We also had the chicken shawarma poutine and man was it ever good!

Definitely will be back and for those who strictly eat Halal - this place is Halal. 

Bon appetite."}
{"text":"I went there last week with my friends for chicken shawarma. The service was a bit slow but loved the food. I'll Definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Solid! That was my reaction after having the beef  shawerma sandwich and beef shawerma poutine. Looks like a family business. Good service, decent price. Will be coming again for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing flavorful food!! So fresh and delicious! The owner was delightful as well. We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered a half-beef, half-chicken poutine ($10.49) and a half-beef, half-chicken shawarma plate ($12.59) to share. There's no half-beef, half-chicken option on their menu but they were more than happy to give us half of each. 

They made the fries for the poutine right when we ordered, which I liked. Hooray for fresh fries! The fries weren't crispy enough, but were still good. The shawarma plate came with a good helping of meat, along with rice, potatoes, hummus, salad, and a pita. 

The place was family run, and they seemed slightly understaffed as they were constantly running around, taking care of orders. However, the wait for food wasn't long. 

I would come back again if I had a craving for shawarma. It seemed that most people were ordering their wraps so I'll probably give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"I love food. (50% of my life is all about food)
This Place. Basically really clean. Fresh ingredients and food is not too salty. So it's really good. Owners are extremely friendly. Best place to grab bite or dinner take out!!"}
{"text":"Solid shawarma option in Markham. The workers here are really friendly! 

The chicken shawarma plate is filled to the brim with meat! It sits on a bed of rice and potatoes. There's some hummus and tahini to the side, with a small salad and some pickles. Everything is very fresh and tasty.

Good value! 

Their wrap combos are a great deal as they come with a drink and side as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!!! Bf and I used to drive all the way to Ottawa for good shaworma....not anymore!!! Their babaganoush is smoky and silky, the chicken tender and juicy, and portions generous!!! That's not to mention the shawarma poutine!!! A couple more smiles from the owners wouldn't hurt though!"}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to shawarma place! Their meal portions are generous and you feel you really get your money's worth. But it's the quality of their food that clinches it. Their chicken shawarma & kebabs are very flavourful and the same goes for their hummus, rice & potatoes. Plus, their salads are always fresh. In addition, the family that run the place are always super-friends and welcoming with warm smiles. This restaurant has been one of my best finds for 2016!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Shawarma Stop! The food is incredibly fresh, prices are very reasonable, and the customer service is unparalleled. I highly recommend the beef shawarma, falafel, hummus, and tabouleh, but literally everything on the menu is delicious. Amer is the owner and he's just the sweetest man ever! He takes the time to help indecisive people like myself make decisions, and then makes sure you're satisfied before you leave. And if you didn't save room for dessert, take it to go because the lady fingers baklava will change your life. I would recommend this restaurant all day, every day!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. 

I had to come back for the beef shawarma. Its always incredibly tasty! The meat is very flavorful and tender with a nice mix of soft and crunchy pieces. The vegetables are always so fresh and crisp!"}
{"text":"Good quality of shawarma. Delicious.
The place is small and the staff are friendly and respectful. They finish the order within seconds. 

The secret red sauce is perfect but the owner didn't make it for a long time.

I hope this restaurant to be more flexible with the working hours."}
{"text":"Lamb Shish Kabob plate, beef shawarma and beef shawarma poutine are all very good. Ask for the garlic sauce and hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME place! I had the chicken shawarma and it was amazing! The owner is very nice. Have the house spicy sauce it's much better than sriracha. Also they make special shawarmas which I did not see on the menu, they add fries to it, you will need to ask. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have you guys watched the first \"Avengers\" movie?  Do you remember the part where Iron Man said he knew a great schwarma place just around the corner?  Well I think he was referring to Schwarma Stop in Markham!

I drive by this place all the time and decided to finally check out this family run Mediterranean place where they serve schwarmas, falafel, etc as well as burgers and fries.

I knew right away that I wanted to try the Chicken Schwarma Poutine because seriously how can I not order that????

The portion is freaking huge!  A ton of chicken schwarma over a massive pile of fries along with gravy and cheese and it was fantastic!  I'm literally in a food coma as I write this as my body tries to process this amount of food in my gut.  Anyone who eats this would have broken one of the seven deadly sins \"gluttony\" and need to repent so share between 2 if you are not a big eater.  

Service was fantastic as the family working there are really friendly.  As a side note they can't give mixed chicken/beef if they are low on beef as they have to save some for people who want beef which is understandable.

Definitely will come back to try all the other items.  OMG I need to hibernate now!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading some of the reviews.

Ordered a party tray - half beef, half chicken.
Also a party try of salad (not sure what kind-see pic)
And some lamb combos

Everyone at the party was happy with the food!!
Very tasty. Nothing over cooked.


Happy with their service, they are friendly over the phone, and call to let you know the order is ready for pickup."}
{"text":"Pretty good shawarma place! Also tried their kefta kebob which was also delicious!

This place has shawarma and grill foodie written all over it. Good ones in the markham area are rare.

The kefta kebob is made to order (10 minutes) but its well worth the wait for something fresh! Meat was nicely marinated and grilled. The meat sauce works well too!

Beef Shawarma was great! It's thick and wrapped together pretty skillfully in a thin pita. Beef was juicy flavourful. Nicely done!

Probably going try their burger next but I don't think it will disappoint, the chef ready is a foodie himself! 

Service is great! All around 5 star package."}
{"text":"Great shawarma and friendly service. I tried it for the first time tonight. The portions were huge and delicious. The owners were friendly and attentive. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Shawarma Stop has been on my bookmarked list for a long time. Today I finally got to try it out for lunch. I stopped in around 11:30am and the place was busy not too packed there were a lot of tables available. They have a huge seating area. The store is very clean which is always a great sign!  The smell of he Shawarma as you walk in is what gets your taste buds flowing! I decided to go with the Beef Shawarma Wrap. They layered the tender and very flavourful beef with the usual shawarma toppings, lettuce, tomato, pickles, cucumber, I skipped the raw onion and picked beets. They top it off with Garlic sauce tahini and hot sauce. I asked for light on the hot sauce and it was perfect just enough zip to keep you eating more! It gets all wrapped up in a very fresh pita and toasted on the grill to warm up the pita. The contrast of the meat and fresh veggies was perfect. The veggies are very fresh and the beef shawarma was perfection. Cooked just right and it was very tender. It also has a touch of crunchiness from spinning while it cooks. The staff here is very friendly and warm. Go try Shawarma Stop you won't be disappointed.   I will be back to try the chicken and lamb and also the Falafel!"}
{"text":"The key to a good shawarma is how it's wrapped and they can toast it extra when requested. The garlic sauce is not too strong for people who don't appreciate the breathe attack it leaves you with after.

They don't have the 2 for 1 shawarma deal here, but for around $7+ it's filled up with enough chicken and toppings for the win.

And then, last but not least, the shawarma poutine!!!! This fried carb attack loaded with chicken, gravy and garlic sauce is a monster meal for around $10 and the styrofoam container is packed. 

Service is efficient and friendly, they definitely earned that yelp sticker on their front door."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my girls. One of them was running late so we ordered a poutine first. The owner was so nice, he was like go enjoy it while its hot, come pay later. The food is amazing here (mayb cuz i was craving some good shawarma) but the humus that came with it is a must try!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on Highway 7 E and Woobine Ave. There were no issues with parking at the main entrance. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff were friendly, had great smiles, and were efficient! 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Average tables and chairs, this was more of a take-out joint with tables if you want to eat your meal quickly. 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
Vegetables were fresh, and meat was high-quality and halal. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Chicken Shawarma Wrap - $7.75: chicken was juicy, tender, and seasoned very well. Came with your choice of veggies (I chose lettuce, cucumbers, pickles, mixed veggies, etc.), and a delicious white sauce. The wrap was quite large, very soft and held the ingredients well! 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
Such a great spot for a quick, delicious, and relatively healthy meal because they packed the wrap with a bunch of fresh vegetables! I would definitely recommend this place for their Shawarma Wraps!"}
{"text":"A nice family owned restaurant. It's not very busy for a sit-in, but many people drop by to get take out. The chicken shawarma wrap is delicious! If I come back next time, I'm going to try the poutine."}
{"text":"The owner is extremely hospitable and nice. Loved giving him my business and enjoy his super delicious food."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! I loved it all. The falafel was made fresh and so delicious. I've never had baba ghanouj anywhere that tasted so good! The Shawarma and kaftah were both awesome. Such great flavor. And the owner was so friendly! I will recommend this place to everyone that I know who likes Lebanese food. Seriously the best I have had! Try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed! Thank you Amir for such great service!"}
{"text":"The owners of the restraunt are so nice!! We got the chicken Shawarma pouting to share with my bf and each of us got a chicken Shawarma wrap. We should not have ordered so much food. The portions are huge and there's tons of chicken in both. The hot sauce here is great as well. I'm now taking home 2/3 of the poutine and half of my wrap. Very good food and amazing staff."}
{"text":"Excellent place for grab and go - fresh food, yummy sauce, awesome garlic fries and friendly service. Definitely our go to shawarma food. Our favourite is chicken shawarma  plate with everything without raw onions."}
{"text":"Interesting location right in the middle of what appears to be 2 auto shops, but the food was straight up amazing, I've never had a Greek/style dish that made me think of comfort food but this spot did just that, my taste buds are ringing! This will be my new go to spot for Lebanese/Greek style can't wait to grub here again"}
{"text":"if you work around the area, it's a nice place to stop by for variety.
i've had the beef shwarma wraps and the beef shwarma dinners, basically the dinner is served with rice and not wrapped up. i usually get everything on it, though sometimes i'll pass on the beets. they have a hot sauce, a garlic sauce and some sort of tzatziki like sauce. beware, of the garlic sauce if you have to talk to people. it will ruin your breath. otherwise though, it's pretty delicious, affordable, nice people, and filling."}
{"text":"Great place with a friendly neighborhood environment. Amer treats you like family and makes you feel right at home. Wonderful great tasting Shawarma!!!"}
{"text":"MUMTAZ! My sister and I agreed this was the best  garlic sauce we've had  by far since moving from Detroit where middle eastern food is prevalent. We ordered the chicken and beef shawarma plates w/ fatoosh, rice and hummus. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Delicious  food, great prices  and the owner Amir is so friendly and welcoming.  Shawarma Stop is a must try. Do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"Great for Halal diners. For takeout or dine-in shawarma this is a great place to go without wandering into Scarborough.  The plate of shawarma can be beef, chicken, or beef/chicken combo, and there are loads of sides including potatoes, rice, salad, hummus and sauce.

They grill kabobs (kebobs) from scratch so order that may take 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"The combo shawarma the choice for the night!

It came with chicken and beef seasoned with their yummy spices. With your choice of two sides. I choose the cucumber salad and hummus. 

The owner was very nice, his name is Amir. He opened his place about 4 months ago. So come check this place out! 

The desserts was also very tasty!"}
{"text":"2.5 Star

I love to support family business and Shawarma Stop does have this small homey cheerful vibe.

Maybe it was a mistake to order a Chicken Shawarma Wrap? The cheapest item on the menu. I could not even find the chicken after taking several bites. I do know veggie and salad is good for me but I am getting a \"Chicken\" wrap after all. I do expect 1/3 of the filling be at least chicken.

Maybe a Chicken Shawarma plate is a better choice? At least I can see what I am getting.

A pass for me unless I have craving for a veggie wrap."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and friendly people. Amir was wonderful to talk to. Stop by and enjoy. The summer slaw was awesome."}
{"text":"The falafel is delicious and the staff is very friendly. Wish they had tabouleh or parsley though."}
{"text":"Best place to get shawarma hands down. Its my go to lunch spot. I've taken some of my friends here for lunch and they loved it too. Good quantity and quality for the price."}
{"text":"I don't see why this place has such great reviews.  The chicken isn't seasoned well.  I've had a bunch of shawarmas around the city because I'm muslim and there are much better spots along Lawrence Ave and elsewhere.  Markham has almost no shawarma joints so I guess why this place has such high reviews because there's no competition around."}
{"text":"Good customer service. I actually tried humus, beef wrap, chicken wrap, shawarma poutine.... top item on the menu must order is the shawarma pouting. The wraps are ok, the humus too light (do not order). Lunch gets busy around 12."}
{"text":"Came here for the very first time as I was craving for some shawarma so I asked for beef but they were sold out! Decided to try the chicken but was a little hesitant. The chicken shawarma is pretty good. The chicken was tender, the portion is huge and the sauce and hummus was spot on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots, great place for an empty stomach. Portions are fantastic for its cost. With three vertical broilers of two chicken and one beef every day they are freshly cut right into your meal. Just thinking about this is making my mouth water. The owners are really friendly and just amazing people, stuffing beef or chicken all the way to the brim of the take out box. 

Highly recommend their beef but be sure to come early before it runs out during the evening."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Markham. Family run business that never disappoints with taste. Quality and freshness has always been great."}
{"text":"Tried the shawarma and mixed poutine (dollar more) out at the restaurant. The poutine was okay. Would get it without the chicken and beef. The shawarma was decent. The don't skimp out on the meat here! :)"}
{"text":"So.  What happens when a bunch of people from one part of the world meets a bunch of other people from other parts of the world and settles on this part of the world and decides to have a feast?  You get FUSION FOOD!  Not to be confused by ConFusion Food.

ConFusion food is when things just don't work out.  Yes you heard it hear first.  ConFusionFood is not good.  Like when grissol breadsticks are served with yogurt and KimChi.  Like Chicken Tikka Masala served with Texas toast and celery dip.  Like ... we can go on this forever.  Suffice it to say, I never did these but for those of you who did or thinks it's cool...?  Good Luck!!!

Hmmm...what happens when you take a potatoes idea from France, put it in the hands of their distant Quebecers cousins and then passed on to imaginative Mid-Easterns in Canada?  You get Shawarma Poutine!  Yum!

My bud and I was hungry and we decided on this place as his co-workers frequented the establishment.

Located east of Woodbine on Hwy 7, they are in the neighbouring mall to Burger King.  Plenty of parking and they open until 10PM - for those who need to fill up after work or just snacking out.

The place itself is a basic fast food place.  A garnish station/cash area with food prep on the back counter.  Menu prominently posted above as you contemplate your plates.

Buddy had the mixed meat (chicken and beef) shawarma plate.  Loads of meat, veggies, hummus and a pita.  I just went for the Chicken Shawarma Poutine.  Portions were unexpectedly large.  Finished just over half of my order and it satisfied my need for \"such bad for me but oh so good\" food.  Packed the rest and will have it for breakie.

All in all, I liked it.  The family run business was fast, friendly and obviously added to the spare tire.  Definitely a repeat place for me.  Now that's Fusion.  

For those who didn't like it, there is a Sauerkraut, blueberry parfait muffin waiting with your ConFusion Food name on it!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't believe this place isn't more well known. The food is perfectly made, he makes it all in house including the fries. Plus he is an amazing person. We went there for a quick lunch and ended up spending 2 hours there talking with a Regular and the owner. 100 % I am going to keep going back as often as I can. Plus he even let us try a sample of some of the other items that we hadnt ordered. The pricing is amazing too. I guarantee you can't get better food or beat this price anywhere else. Amir you are amazing keep doing what you are doing."}
