{"text":"Food arrived ice cold as if just taken out of the fridge. I'd caution against ordering delivery from this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is bad. The owner writes negative reviews on golden harbor's Yelp page, which reflects what kind of a business this is. Charging tips without telling customers, is bs. Food ain't that great either. Also, the owner constantly sending ads and spamming my wechat (a Chinese chatting app) got so bad that I had to delete him. I would give the owner a 0 star if possible."}
{"text":"I just had a order delivered from this restaurant. While the food was decent I am really surprised with the rude attitude of the delivery guy. First he called me and started blabbering in Chinese, it took him full two minutes to realize that I don't speak Chinese. I mean come on! why on earth you'd just assume that nobody other can Chinese can order Chinese food online! Then he calls me again from downstairs and told me that  he is at my gate. I live in an apartment complex that does not have a locked entrance. When I asked him to bring the delivery to my apartment at 3rd floor he hung up on me and came up a couple of minutes later, didn't respond to my 'Hi\", almost threw the package at me and left. I am seriously shocked to see such rudeness! I'm not sure how you stay in business with this level of professionalism!   Never going to this place ever again or ordering anything online, ever again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Szechuan China 4 times now, still amazing and easily the best Chinese in Champaign IMO. Unfortunately, most of the people reviewing Chinese places here non-Chinese (like 90% white people). There's a reason that this place's parking lot is often full of cars; several of my international student friends that have eaten here have all said that they love it. Last time I went with some, one of them said about some of the dishes: \"It feels like I'm back in China.\" If you would like some help with what to order, I highly recommend the following:  Chongqing fish filet with pickled vegetables Ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce hot and sour shredded potato eggplant with chili sauce seared cow stomach san bei chicken  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????? ???? ????? ???? ????? ???"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the food was excellent.  The reason that I am only giving 3 stars is price and service.  The evening that we went, they were not very busy.  As soon as we were seated, the waitress asked us if we were ready to order.  We asked for additional time as it is an extensive menu with lots of interesting dishes.  Once we ordered and received our food, our waitress never came back to check on us for refills on our drinks or to inquire whether we were enjoying our food (we were). The prices seem a bit high for the portions, but the main complaint is that a 15% gratuity was added to the bill.  I have seen this in restaurants in larger cities or with large groups (we were a party of 2), but it is not typical in this area and the service certainly didn't warrant a large tip.  Plus, when we paid by credit card, the cashier said we could add a tip to the receipt- on TOP of the tip the restaurant had added. Our bill for two dinners with only water to drink was a bit over $35, which I consider high for Chinese restaurants in this area.  Hopefully they will work out the service issues and maybe adjust their price/tip policy, but the food was great and worth at least one trip."}
{"text":"It's actual Chinese food, not American Chinese food, and not as varied as Golden Harbor (and of a slightly different style).  The quality of the food is really quite high, and everything we ordered was very good.  I find it comparable to some of Boston Chinatown's best (having spent lots of time there, that's my benchmark).  Their black jasmine tea is that excellent classic tea that can only be found at good Chinese restaurants, and when I asked, they were happy to sell me a pint of tea leaves.  They do a dim sum daily from 11-4 pm, which we did, along with a few other dishes.  The dandan noodles were some of the best we've had--spicy but not too spicy and a bit sweet, and the texture of the noodles were perfect.  The wonton soup broth had clearly been made from scratch and the wontons were delicious, as were the shumai and shrimp dumplings.  Edamame was perfectly cooked and not over-salted. The only dish we didn't love was the pork bun.  It was tasty and well-made, but the pork inside was not the char siu (barbeque) that we expected (or wanted!).  I'm happy this place opened--despite looking on the outside like standard American Chinese fare, it really isn't.  It's some of the best Chinese food in the Chambana area."}
{"text":"Food was generally not good and some of them were terrible, service was bad, however they charge tip directly."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice, and it's our favorite Chinese restaurant here in town, although not the cheapest. The quality of the food is excellent and comparable in quality to some of the restaurants in Chinatown in Chicago where I lived for several years. Most recently we went on a Sunday night and ordered shrimp with vegetables and mapo tofu (see my 2 photos). The mapo was tangy, spicy, garlicky, and delicious. The shrimp with vegetables was in an orange/garlic sauce with some baby bok (yum!) and red bell pepper. The shrimp were huge and memorable and I am definitely ordering the dish again in the future. Tasteful decor and polite staff. The restaurant was full of Asian people at dinner time. At weekday lunch it tends to be a different crowd with people coming in for the lunch specials which are smaller portions and limited in entree choices."}
{"text":"Had a great meal of Dim Sum and hot tea.  The owner helped guide my selection.  The food was delicious and the hot tea was the perfect accompaniment.   This is a new restaurant and I was anxious to try it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place the day I moved out of Champaign and wish I had found out about it much earlier. I think they opened recently. They have pretty cheap lunch specials ($7-$8) that are good in quantity and pretty tasty. I recommend the Mongolian Beef. It's a good alternative to some of the options offered closer to campus"}
{"text":"Real authentic spicy Szechuan Chinese cuisine so don't go in there with expectations of watered-down American-Chinese food like the average Joe's General Tso's chicken (although they do serve some American-Chinese cuisine here).  Mapo tofu is the bomb - just one spoonful of the soup in your mouth and the next thing you know your tongue goes numb from the spice and you start sweating everywhere. If you love spicy food this is where you go to. The service was a-OK but the manager here is a nice guy."}
{"text":"Had the hot pot twice and came here for dinner the food is really good, there is some difficulty with speaking and language but depending who your waitress is the problem may not be there. The food is authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"Szechuan China easily has the best Chinese food I've eaten in CU, but they're lacking in consistency. 3.5 stars if I could.  First, the bad: I've been here five times with friends and each time one of the dishes we order comes out looking like garbage, tasting extremely bland, or both. Once it was the spicy string bean (sijidou), which had no flavor at all. Just today, the \"fine shred potato with spicy capsicum\" (tudousi) I ordered came out gray. I'm just so confused - how do you stir fry potatoes and make them gray? I've ordered the same exact dish before, and the potatoes were a beautiful shade of gold.  All of that said, though, the food here is great when the chefs are on-point. The mapo tofu, ox tongue, eggplant dishes, and twice cooked pork are all authentic and tasty Sichuan staples. It's on par with the stuff I've eaten back in Los Angeles, and approved by my friend from Sichuan. And really, the proof is in this place's popularity with the Chinese crowd. Even on a random Wednesday night, the place is packed with Chinese families waiting to get a taste of Sichuan.  P.S. I'm Chinese. This means I get tons of advantages over other reviewers: I don't make the mistake of ordering one dish for myself and not eating family style (i.e. dishes are supposed to balance each other out, not dominate your mouth with one flavor for an hour). I know what I'm getting before it comes to the table, and what it should taste like. I know not to order off the American menu. It's disappointing to see that things like these fuel bad reviews when its a culture clash rather than a food issue."}
{"text":"I feel very bad writing a negative review about a restaurant that clearly is popular. But I must be honest. A little over a week ago, my wife and I decided to try Szechuan China. When we walked into the place we were encouraged, because we were the only Anglos there. If Asians liked it, it must be good! And for all I know, it is outstanding according to genuine ethnic standards. The hostess was very friendly, as was our waiter, although he did not appear to understand that, when there are a gazillion items on a menu, diners should not be expected to order within three minutes of being seated. When our orders arrived (rather quickly, in fact), both were feasts for the eyes. Everything was great thus far.  But that's where the feast ended. My wife ordered a dish that featured mushrooms and tofu. Although beautiful to look at, it was tasteless. We both decided that they must not have added any flavorings to it--it appeared to be just mushrooms and tofu, nothing else (except for, presumably, the cornstarch that created the lovely thickness of the sauce).  My entree, a Szechuan dish featuring poached fish in a very hot chili sauce, at first impressed me with its zing. But after a minute or so, I began to taste the salt. Wow! I grew up with traditional Texas cuisine, which means that I was pretty much pickled in sodium chloride by the time I was in my teens--so saltiness is not inimical to my taste buds. But this was beyond the pale. I was still tasting the salt half an hour after I got home, even after rinsing my mouth several times with water. (I should also mention that the dish overflowed with oil.)  Because we are impecunious, we never leave food on our plates at a restaurant; we even carry rather substantial containers in our car so that we don't have to ask for unecological Styrofoam containers. Yet this is the first time in our many years of marriage that we have left substantial portions of restaurant dishes on our plates. I was able to eat only about a third of my food before the extreme saltiness forced me to stop eating. My wife ate about a fourth of her entree before its tastelessness led her to stop eating. And we had absolutely no desire to take the leftovers home. I fixed some snacks for us after we got home to satisfy our still-significant hunger.  To their credit, the kind folks at the restaurant offered to give us a discount (which we refused). We left a generous tip. We understand it's possible that we happened to order dishes that were anomalously poor. But we figure that, as rarely as we eat out, we dare not risk another fifty bucks by returning to Szechuan China."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this place was when it first opened, and it was absolutely amazing. I think I have the right to say that since I tried 6 of their dishes! I came here about a month later, and it was so crowded. Everyone was so busy, and all our food were not prepared the same way at all. I was pretty disappointed, but I'm sure this review will help them improve. This restaurant has amazing potential!"}
{"text":"Never ever eat here. They could not be any less professional and disgusting. I waited an hour for food and the delivery person could not even find my apartment let alone give me directions to find them. EatStreet was not helpful and as someone in the restaurant industry I've never been so angry. If I wanted to leave my apartment for food I would have gone to the restaurant. I will never eat here again or use Eatstreet."}
{"text":"Tried hot pot there.. it is not so good. Spicy but not tasty... I would never go there again."}
{"text":"We loved it here. Good authentic Chinese food, good service, nice and quiet seating. Definitely, we will come back!"}
{"text":"Automatic tipping 15% but the waitress didn't even care to stop by after we ordered the food.  The owner was indifferent and seemed to be impatient when we questioned about one of the dishes.  Overall don't come to this place!!!  I really just want to give zero star!!"}
{"text":"Never try the hotpot there. Never. Each meat costs you 7 bucks and only offers 7-8 rolls (so $1 per roll). Meat looks like freezing for a century. Very unfresh. Additional advice: dont go there during busy hours (weekend) The owner of the restaurant seems running out of money to hire more waiters (only 4 girls serving 50 people on a Saturday night?) U wait for a century until someone serves you. In a word, terrible customer experience."}
{"text":"I went with two of my co workers. I got the generals chicken. It was crispy. Burnt black crispy.  My co worker got the hunan beef which was 90% fat and cheap meat. The tea tasted like soap water. They brought the food out one order at time with minutes in between. When we got our check we asked to split it. They responded \"no split check\" and told us that there was a 20 dollar minimum if you use debit or credit cards.  Oh and the lunch didn't come with a egg roll, and no fortune cookies after the meal. Will never return."}
{"text":"Quick update- if you want to read all about their food see my review below. Just found out that the owner of Szechuan China is uploading fake reviews and fake photos. If you look at the Yelp photos of Szechuan China you'll see a few stock photos of food, that is not actual food from the restaurant. Even worse the same guy \"King J.\" Is trolling Golden Harbor's Yelp with fake 1 star reviews that barely make sense. This combined with their 2 star food is simply unacceptable."}
{"text":"My partner and I were excited to try this place; we both love Chinese food and spicy dishes and we love supporting local businesses.  I ordered from the vegetarian portion of the menu and the dish that came looked interesting but it was about 50% fish. I explained that I don't eat animals at all and since the dish was in the vegetarian section and didn't specifically say it contained animals, I was expecting a vegetarian dish. The waitress asked if I liked vegetables (really) and suggested a tofu and bok choi dish. I was a bit apprehensive because \"tofu and bok choi\" tends to be incredibly boring, but as the staff recommended it, I thought it must be a good choice. NOPE! The dish was swimming in translucent, viscous, whitish sauce that lacked any flavor besides salt. I ate a few pieces of tofu and they were bland and squishy, the bok choi was limp and similarly flavorless. I didn't bother trying the frozen carrot cubes or peas that were floating in the sea of slime. After a few minutes, the sauce began to congeal. It was, quite frankly, disgusting.  A server asked if I liked the dish and, trying to be nice, I told her it was very bland and not to my tastes. She asked if I wanted to take it to go (uh, no) and when I said I did not, she picked it up, made a strange face, sticking out her tongue, and took it away. I don't know if she didn't see that I was looking at her or if she was sympathizing. I'm sad to say, the rice wasn't even good. My partner did like his dish and said the fishy tofu was pretty good but also had a slimy sauce. They charged us for all 3 dishes and a 15% tip on top of it! The tip wasn't indicated anywhere that we could see, so basically it's a rip off."}
{"text":"The food and service were pretty good.  My complaint is the deceptive pricing.  I had lunch there on Saturday, and despite a sign on the curb, and a sign on the door advertising it, the $6.95 lunch special is not available.  I was charged over $15 for the same food.  In their defense there is a tiny, scribbly, ballpoint ink note on the menu that the specials are Monday - Friday that was pointed out to me when I complained.  I made a point of  ordering the small portion, the waitress either didn't speak English well enough to understand, or chose to ignore me.  I got the feeling this happens a lot, and is intentional, not simple communication error.  I vow never to darken their door again."}
{"text":"A Sichuan restaurant opened by some one from Fujian. It's just like a restaurant has a name called Illinois and tell you we have they best Kentucky fried chicken. They biggest problem is dishes are salty and price a too high. It won't be in my list any more."}
{"text":"Been here twice; a week before a belated grand opening, and during the grand opening.  Apparently, this restaurant is positioning itself a bit more like a fine dining options than other restaurants in this town. However, the quality of service is not following the price and napkins. They simply won't come to your table. During the grand opening week, we waited for about 50 minutes for them to take order, re-ask the server to bring the drinks we asked for, and finally get the first dish of food.  On the other hand, I liked their food. But the thing is, that the virtue I found in their plates, was more about its blandness (in a good way). I was expecting an extreme spiciness from the name 'Szechuan China.'  However, I really should say that I liked their spicy fish and tofu dish before I finish. I would visit this restaurant again for that single dish."}
{"text":"I did takeout. They make a nice minced chicken-corn-egg drop soup that I love ordering when I'm unwell. But I cannot believe that quality control is so shoddy that I found a piece of METAL in my soup. That's just dangerous. I also found a lone sprout but finding metal in your food really takes the cake."}
{"text":"I'd give Szechuan China 2.5 stars if that was an option. The place is decorated well: quiet, neutral colors, with tasteful accents in richer tones. It's clean and grown-up in atmosphere. But, the food was okay -- not that good, not that great. The dishes offer quality ingredients, but the preparation of the entrees is uninspired and the appetizers average, with no real pop in flavor.   We stopped in for lunch, since lunch specials offer a reasonable price at which to try a new restaurant. We were excited by reviews of authentic and spicy food focusing on the Szechuan region.  The lunch special menu was made up of only Chinese American standard dishes, which was a disappointment. I ordered the chicken with garlic sauce and fried rice. My partner ordered General Tso's with steamed rice. We also had meat dumplings and the Shanghai spring rolls. We didn't get the soup, since a single-serving appetizer portion of soup was $5. The pricing overall is uneven.  My entree, the chicken with garlic sauce, came with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other vegetables. It had little to no garlic flavor, but a pleasant late lingering spice. The entree had far, far too much sauce, and of the slightly too sweet, gloppy variety (so much that I was a little disgusted by it). My partner's General Tso's chicken was crispy, but again too sweet and little spice. The fried rice with my dish was fine, but lacked any aromatics and had no meat for flavoring either. We did not receive spoons with any dish to help serve portions onto a smaller plate.  The meat dumplings were in the long wrappers pinched on one side. They seemed like they might contain pork mixed with chicken. They lacked in flavor -- no ginger, garlic, herb -- and were under-seasoned. The spring rolls came with a spring roll wrapper. The server (whose English was not great) said he thought they had meat in them. He agreed to cabbage but seemed less sure. They had cabbage in them, but the meat was hard to see or taste. They had a decent texture, but didn't taste like much on the inside. The dipping sauce for the potstickers was vinegary and salty (soy base) with no scallions, garlic, or other flavoring. The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was standard sweet n sour. We asked for hot mustard and received carryout packets.  The portion size for lunch was generous enough. The value was decent. The hot tea was good, but was not replenished by mid meal.  I complained on the way out that we were automatically charged a 15% tip on the bill for a party of two. The woman at the front counter said they are doing this because in China tipping is not done and many Chinese who eat at restaurants here do not tip. I don't think it's legal for the restaurant to include the tip automatically in the bill, but I'm not sure. There are no signs or notices about it. I told her it would offend American customers. In our case, it also cheated the server, because we usually tip 20%.  We have speculated that the many authentic Chinese menu items might be better prepared and interesting. There are many dishes with traditional ingredients (such as tripe). We can't confirm that they are any better, however.  Given the underwhelming preparation and the weak service with the required gratuity, I doubt that we will be back."}
{"text":"I will never go to this restaurant. They served us very late. The manager apologized to us, but when he was explaining, he was like yelling at us. His attitude was terrible. He finally agreed to give us 50% discount, but the girl on the front desk still charged us full price after we told her we had discount. This restaurant is not good, neither food nor service."}
{"text":"Solidly excellent siquan cuisine. A little bit pricey but worth it if one is looking for authentic dishes from Western China.   On the minus side, while their dim sum tastes excellent the portion sizes to price ratio and overall selection are small.  Stick to their specialty, authentic siquan cuisine for best results."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????50???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\"????\"???????????????????"}
{"text":"I give them 4 star, because they make big changes, i been this restaurant 3 times, first time they just open, was ok service, was very busy, every body run around, it's so funny, food was salty , 2nd time I was there 1weeks ago, food make much better,and servers are good , nice to taking care my table, today every was ok , they only have 5 tables, so no body kind funny running around, and I like they free cool dish before you order from menu, we still get free cup of sweet dessert, it's very nice for all customers. I think they can make better, ... So ....."}
{"text":"Good news - the food is good.  Bad news - A 15% gratuity was added to our bill without our knowledge or permission and after we had left a cash tip on the table.  The automatically added gratuity was not posted anywhere on the menu or near the cash register. We were not a \"big\" party - only my husband, son, and me.    Also the price on the menu is less than what we were actually charged.  The chicken and broccoli is listed as $10.99 (the after 3PM, non lunch special price) and we were charged $11.99.  Unfortunately we noticed the mistakes after we were home - an hour away. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I would say: the dish are not as traditional as original spicy Chinese food. But it's absolutely the best in town for spicy Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! reminded me of the authentic szechuan that I can get from the chinatown at home. i had been dreaming of that shredded potato dish and never thought i would be able to get it here in champaign. if you are looking for standard chinese  american fare, you have to remember that szechuan is a lot more spicy, and i love that about it. when i ordered a tofu dish the server asked if it was ok that it had meat and i said of course. So i think they are starting to learn how to be more vegetarian accessible. they also asked if we had any questions about the menu. where i am from the menus for szechuan won't be that descriptive and will not have pictures, i appreciated that they took the time to explain what their dishes are. I also like how they converted the decor of the place. looking forward to trying more stuff on the menu. i love that they brought some heat to this town."}
{"text":"I've tried the place three times. Two for takeout around 5-6pm. Each time there's no one at the front of the house. The wait staff just glance at you and do nothing to move the process forward. The portions are a bit too small. I'm going to try them 2-3 more times, but if nothing stands out to me, I will hit up Golden Harbor more."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love eating here. The food tastes authentic. I love the dry braised dishes, so yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Only flavor of this food was salt. Too expensive, small portions and horrible flavor. Spend your money at Golden Harbor where you get some good food and real value."}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambience. The server we got was hella funny.  Huge portions and yummy. Great for groups. Its pricey (though it was a 25% discount for the grand opening so my bill came out to be $30 for 2 coronas and 2 good dishes that was more than enough for my friend and me) and I paid $4 for corona.  I give them 4 stars because I went thirsty for like 15 minutes and I couldn't get their attention, I finally asked my friend, a white male, to get their attention. He got it. And though I was paying the bill, they gave him my credit card.    Otherwise, barring the gendered dynamics, pretty decent place to go with a group and hang out and eat.   I will go back and try another couple of dishes."}
{"text":"Their hot pot is slightly less expensive than Hot Pot Labs, not that that says much. Everything was alright, friendly service... Then our food arrived.  The biggest problem was with the pork intestine. It was cut up into bits stacked in a huge pile. I was hesitant but tried it-- because why not!-- and at first, it was fine. Then the foul smell and taste of feces set in... We left it untouched for the rest of the meal. A particular staff member kept asking us why we didn't want to take it to-go until we revealed the reason, and understandably pork intestine is hard to clean in the first place. We weren't offered a refund, and got hit with the 15% added gratuity like others have mentioned. Haven't gone back since."}
