{"text":"My favourite coffee place in the area! It's such a well balanced place! Food is yummy and healthy, staff is friendly, big windows, delicious tea...and they play Motown! My oasis...."}
{"text":"The music was really bad and loud pop , disappointed and the London fog was ok, customer service not so good."}
{"text":"Great coffee and amazing food. Perfect addition to the neighbourhood. Short walk from Pape subway station and plenty of parking. I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in if your in the area. The place is very cool looking. Staff is nice and the owner is top notch. 

I had the warm goat cheese sandwich. The bun is nice fresh The chicken is very nice because I believe it's been grill. Definitely try either latte and they look like they have a bunch of juices that seem very fresh

I will be back soon thanks for the great customer service"}
{"text":"Cappuccino was okay. A little flat. Definitely better places to go to in the area. I hear their food is pretty good though."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot. Nice coffee, great food - fresh, healthful - and good design inside. People get critical of this neighbourhood, but they shouldn't - and Goat Coffee Co. is more evidence of the goodness of this 'hood. I love how you can call ahead for pickup orders. Better than nearly any cafe when the whole package is taken together - better than Rooster, Merchant of Green, Green Beanery, Dark Horse. Those all have good beans, but this has so much more. Not pretentious; just earnest goodness. Go, enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood spot--amazing food and excellent coffee...nice vibe and very clean...only complaint: they need to have skim milk available not just homo! They also charge extra for almond milk which I'm not a fan of because some people can't drink cows milk for dietary reasons !"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, always fresh, and the staff are friendly. 

Unfortunately their coffee is terrible. It tastes like a boiled potato. And they serve it in a paper cup, even though I tell them I will drink it there (unlike other indie shops that serve their coffee in glassware). Now, it has been about a year since the last time I was there, so maybe they changed their roaster, but if not, I would highly recommend they do."}
{"text":"Great food and nice presentation. There is a good selection of sandwiches, salads, breakfast sandwiches, and kids items made fresh in the kitchen. 

The coffee left something to be desired. The barista seemed untrained, inexperienced, and over all wasn't that into it. My latte was slapped together with too much foam, way too hot, and a bitter taste. It didn't have the smooth and balanced flavour I look for in an espresso."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint and the best coffee. Everyone is so sweet and it totally beats the named brands .. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Seeing so many positive reviews with this cafe but I have to say I must be the unlucky one. Ordered a cappuccino, it's weak and lousy. I don't know but I am not finding anything great on my cup. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"A good neighbourhood spot that's never totally empty and never totally full. Good espresso based drinks, great little treats, fantastic light food fare (soups and salads). They're always experimenting, revamping, and changing it up. They've got all the staples of your traditional coffee spot: reclaimed wood tables, minimalist light fixture with vintage Einstein bulbs, random word in large marquee letters on the wall, a big shiny espresso maker, guy with beard behind the bar (they've recently upped their cool factor with a guy with a beard AND VISIBLE TATTOOS behind the bar, hmmm)... But in an impressively unpretentious way. Come here, but don't come here because it's my spot, alright?"}
{"text":"Wowww! What a gem this place is! 
The cappuccino came in a huge mug - was beautiful and delicious!!!  The food is really yummy and good quality!   The staff is soooooooo friendly!  Vicki was serving us and  has exceptional customer service skills!! She made us feel so welcome and at home! A really really awesome experience, a must try!! we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great americanos!  There is plenty of seating, and even a little patio.  The food looks good, although I have never tried anything.  Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Currently, I was looking for a good place to try avocado toast So I visited this place by searching. This place has a great customer service and cozy atmosphere as well. The price is pretty reasonable. i liked the avocado toast too."}
{"text":"I love this place. My God did we need a coffee shop in this neighbourhood and we got a great one. Great environment, great people, great food, great coffee."}
{"text":"We happen to make impromptu visit to this cafe since we were in the neighborhood. We were able to get seating easily, though the cafe is cozy, shared center table lot of seating. We had Americano and Blueberry Cheese Croissant, both were perfect! I'd definately go here again to try full breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This is what all small neighbourhood coffee shops should strive to be. Excellent service, food, and of course, great coffee. I came here with a friend for a late lunch and the place was packed. There are not many tables, so be prepared to sit on a stool along the window.  

We each had a cappuccino, which was excellent and served in a mug. I have a greater appreciation for my cappuccino when I do not have to drink it out of a paper cup. I ordered the avocado BLT. It arrived quickly to my table and had the perfect ratio of avocado to tomato and bacon. The addition of arugula and a garlic aioli elevated the traditional sandwich.

I would absolutely come back to this spot for brunch or lunch and a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood coffeehouse that we visited for the first time. Friendly service. We had breakfast and coffee, ordered the ooh la la and mushroom egg sandwich. Both yummy. My decaf americano was so tasty I couldn't believe it was decaf! Definitely will be going back there again."}
{"text":"January 31st around 3 pm.Nobody on counter 
Waiting to order.The young girl saw me, asked nothing to me, continue gridding coffee. After 2 min she asked if I am for coffee or eating. I said   both. Her reply:\"Then you have to wait\"
like she was doing me a favour and not any explanation whatsoever. If only was the only coffee shop in neighborhood....."}
{"text":"So i really like this joint. The goat cheese/chicken sammy and the breakfast burrito are super good and reasonably priced. Side patio is nice as well. Outlets for laptops along the bench if you can get a spot (there is wifi as well). Only downside - the cashier is also the barista, seems like. So if you go during a busy period, it can get backed up really fast if someone orders a few lattes. Owners should consider having a part time kid jerk coffees for rush hours, would make a big diff. Otherwise 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food!!!  Seriously loved the BLT and the goat cheese salad!  Highly recommend everyone to try this place out!"}
{"text":"It is a real gem in East York.  I'm so happy I found myself and my colleagues such a nice lunch place only a few minutes drive from my work.

The interior decor is chic and comfortable.  The small but bright patio on the side street is a bonus.

People working there are nice and they make good sandwiches and coffees.  Decaf coffee is available on certain coffee types.  I tried the chicken and goat cheese sandwich during my first visit.  The chicken breast was freshly grilled and juicy.  The goat cheese melted with the meat was simply a perfect combination.  With the best sandwich bread they used, I just loved it.

They have special salads too.  Their portions are big and they are always fresh.

Besides, their breakfast sandwiches are served whole day.   What can I say? 

I deduct one star because the waiting time for the food is a bit long.   However, if you want freshly made sandwich with fresh real meat.  It's worth the wait.  The indoor dining area is a bit too warm during the late summer days but we can survive lol!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it opened and have really enjoyed my visits. The coffee is very good, and the superfood salad with chicken was excellent. Nice bright space, and you can actually find parking nearby."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try the Chicken and Goat Cheese sandwich. The first time I had it, I went back two more times in the same week. Yup, I had the same thing 3 times in 5 days. I've cut coffee, so opted for their London Fog and it was amazing as well. They use Sloane tea, which I adore!!  My third time back was on a Saturday morning and the wait was quite long. The sandwich also takes a bit longer as they make it fresh. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"S'alright here.

For an indie coffee shop, I didn't quite feel that special something you feel with your fav locations. 

Had a coffee and work for an hour on my laptop. The wifi was spotty at best."}
{"text":"I love love love the \"Ooh la la\" breakfast! The coffee is great and the atmosphere is amazing, especially when it's a nice and sunny day on the patio!"}
{"text":"What a find! Awesome lunch spot, and very good coffee. Welcoming, upbeat atmosphere. Their goat cheese and beet salad was fantastic - huge portion size, which was great! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"A wonderful much needed spot in this area. Serving coffee and teas and Dufflet's pastries, as well as an array of creative delicious sandwiches. Many weighed down with tons of cheese. It's got great counter service, the staff is super friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are unisex and very clean. A great spot to go for a light meal. The decor is also really nice. Love the huge GRAZE sign."}
{"text":"I always order an Americano from new coffee places as it's a good indicator for me.  The Americano I got today at Goat during my first (and only visit, forever) was flavourful but weak (single shot).  What was a real turnoff was the bearded guy behind the counter.  Same vibe as Bulldog, yikes.  He  didn't greet us, barely muttered a hello when we greeted him, was indifferent and never made any attempt at interaction or eye contact, and walked away from us right after he took our order to berate one of his staff for leaving the back door open.  Just really poor trashy practice, and we were absolutely turned off this place, immediately.  The cafe is beautiful but utterly lacks any atmosphere, personality or soul and looks like a ripoff of a million other indie coffee houses in the city (communal table, window bar, exposed brick, reclaimed wood blah blah blah).  Too bad as there's nothing to rival it in the area.  I will never ever go back, and don't care whether this mediocre cookie cutter place lasts."}
{"text":"To the gluten free community, we finally have a good place for us in the east. When I asked if they had gluten free bread I received an enthusiastic yes. And the quality of the bread was great. I was assured that the home fries were gluten free and they were. I feel comfortable eating here without worrying about cross contamination. Plus the customer service was excellent  and the washroom, which is on the same floor, was immaculate. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the seating gets filled up quickly at around noon."}
{"text":"Food was good, coffee was ok, service was bad. 

Super slow food preparation that made the good food almost felt like it was my consolation as supposed to making me feel it's worth the wait. 

Seating was also a bit of a mess. There is a huge table in the middle that can sit about the 10 people. However, half of the table was occupied by one of the server's 3 friends. The server also made sure to take another spot so she can have her breakfast during a busy brunch time. The bar area can also fit about 8-10 people, but, there were only 4 bar stools available. As I said, a bit of a mess.

A little bit more smiles from the while crew can also go a very long way. Maybe then, I could have overlooked some of the negative things we've experienced.

Plenty of parking space around is probably the best thing that I can say about this place.

Needless to say, I will not be back. There are plenty of other coffeeshops around."}
{"text":"Staying nearby at an AirBNB - this place is fantastic for coffee and legit breakfasts!"}
{"text":"The avocado sandwich was good however they asked me if I wanted to add fries and charged me $3.50, which is how much the home fries are so I said yes. They brought out sweet potato fries (which are $5) and when I tried to ask for a refund (because I don't like them and didn't order them) the owner yelled at me and told me I didn't know how to read the menu properly. He also threatened to kick me out. So my $10 sandwich turned into $15. Not a good experience and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has good coffee and good food. Goat offers free wifi, use of cc and their menu offers a nice variety or breakfast and lunch options. Only thing I would recommend is that they offer water to their patrons instead of having to buy it."}
{"text":"The rumors are true! This is the greatest of all time! GOAT was on my list of cafés to check out in Toronto. I thought it was just a coffee shop, but they food. Not your average food but GOAT food. We ordered the mushroom egger and the avocado toast. Both excellent and worth making the trip here to have. Service is warm. Enough seating +patio. There are some electrical outlets. WiFi's not working right now so I don't know about the speed. GOAT had moved from my 'to try' list to my regular cafés to visit list. As mentioned here, all neighbourhood cafés should aspire to be GOAT."}
{"text":"Good coffee , nice service and good vibe. Could see myself hanging out here for a few hours catching up on work."}
{"text":"I had a cappuccino which was pretty good. Not too much milk and the coffee had a very pleasant and smooth flavour. Outdoor seating is a plus. I just wish the barista had listened to me when I ordered the coffee (I wanted it to stay but got it in a paper cup)."}
{"text":"Goat Coffee Co is situated around Pape subway station, around a 8-10 min walk from the station. This local neighbourhood cafe emits a friendly, warm, and relaxing vibe upon entering and the space fills up with natural light due to the many windows. 

I dropped by the cafe on a Saturday morning at around 10am and the cafe was already half filled with customers enjoying their morning breakfast and coffee. I waited in line for about 5 minutes as the customer ahead of me was ordering multiple drinks. I got an Americano and an avocado toast which came up to around $7. Upon sitting down, my drink and food was promptly delivered to me. Both the coffee and the toast were good, but nothing spectacular to rave about. 

Overall, Goat Coffee Co is a great local coffee shop to hang out at for the neighbourhood. I've had better coffee and food elsewhere but if you're around the area and in need of some caffeine, go check it out!"}
