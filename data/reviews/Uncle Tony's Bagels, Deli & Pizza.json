{"text":"A good breakfast sandwich is a work of art. Properly executed, it highlights the delicate interplay of altogether pedestrian, but not easily achieved breakfast staples, and elevates these workaday ingredients to something altogether sublime. It begins with the bagel--a breakfast item as ubiquitous as it is simple. Despite this, most bagels are dry and dense, closer in texture to Styrofoam than actual food, redeemable only by copious amounts of over-sweetened schmear that transform an actual, adult breakfast into a first-grade-Fruit-Loop-cereal-milk-sugarfest. Uncle Tony's returns the bagel to what it should be with their expertly-crafted homemade bagels. They are perfectly chewy with a crust that just gives way as you bite through to a dense but smooth center. There's a distinct difference between the core, mantle, and crust of their bagels - as God intended it to be.  Having laid a foundation worthy of any landmark in the Empire State, they fry an egg to order on a searing hot flattop. Unlike the bagel, which requires precision and space and time, a perfectly fried egg is a pleasure so easily achieved that anyone with a frying pan and five minutes can enjoy one in the comfort of their own home on a daily basis. It is a wonder, then, that it is so difficult to find a decently fried egg on a breakfast sandwich. From the coffee chains' unholy microwaved (almost) egg-flavored rubber to a rival midtown deli's sheet pan egg cakes, even if another proprietor managed to get the bagel right (but lest you forget, they don't), I would happily free all the chickens at Hickmans Farm to never eat one of these again. Not so with Uncle Tony's. Barely crisp on the edges and with the yolk just set, they compose half of the perfect textural point-counterpoint alongside the next component of the perfect breakfast sandwich: bacon.  Uncle Tony's makes all variety of breakfast sandwich you would expect from a self-styled New York establishment, but when it comes to the Platonic ideal of breakfast sandwiches, there is only one option, and that is bacon. It is the breakfast meat by which to judge all other breakfast meats (yes, sausage is good, but is it \"bacon-good\"?), and by extension, the breakfast meat by which to judge all breakfast sandwiches. The sins one can commit against bacon are many: burn it, leave it soggy, mix it into some sacrilegious bacon candy bar. (No, it's not a perfect mix of sweet and savory; it's just weird.) Uncle Tony's again gets it right: they start with bacon that is thick but not too thick and cook it until it lands just between rubbery and burned, equal parts chew and crunch.   These ingredients are pulled from the flattop and assembled on that perfect bagel and brought together under the bond that runs deeper than family or country, that great and patriotic American cheese. Through one single slice of processed cheese-food, each component of the Uncle Tony's breakfast sandwich form something which is far greater than even the sum of the inscrutable perfection of its parts.   I am fortunate enough to work a short walk from this much-welcomed addition to the midtown Central Avenue cubicled high rise colony. And while my days find my nose buried in the dehumanizing, soul-crushing work of spreadsheets and conference calls, Uncle Tony now provides me with one moment of hope each morning, a moment when anything is possible, when perfection is found, when all is right in the world."}
{"text":"Today I had a Personal Pizza with three topping's (pepperoni, mushrooms and jalapenos) and a drink. The pizza crust and sauce is very bland and the mushrooms were from a can and not fresh. I dined in and the it seemed that oil was burning and it  caused my eyes to hurt and my cloths to smell. I was hoping for a better experience as they are a new establishment."}
{"text":"I work in the building next door to Uncle Tony's.  After having the Duck & Decanter in that space for so long, seeing a restaurant as empty as it is was disconcerting.  But I was so happy they finally opened that I decided to give it a shot.  This is a family owned and operated business.  My first try was a bagel.  They make them fresh onsite and they're big and fluffy on the inside, chewy on the outside, but there is something missing.  Maybe salt?  Not sure.  Texture was great though.  Okay.  Next time I tried the personal pizza special.  The pizza was not great.  Third try was the two slices of pizza lunch special and the pizza was totally different than the personal pizza.  It was fantastic!  Big slices with great crust, tasty sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  Not real greasy, either.  But what clinched it for me was the turkey sandwich and the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.  Both were made on plain bagels which were extremely fresh and both sandwiches were delicious.    If Tony's would add some displays in the empty shelves, maybe some sweets or baked goods for the 2pm crash time, and the ever elusive coffee drinks, business would probably pick up.  Special shout out to Tony's daughter, Yetta, who is just a sweetheart and very nice to do business with."}
{"text":"I finally stopped here for the pizza lunch special. Soooo good wish I found this place sooner.  Delicious pizza & homemade bagels.  This is a little hidden treasure! Super nice family owned staff is a huge plus. I will definitely make this a regular pizza stop."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place isn't busier. Its not seeable from central which could hurt it but they had signs to easily find It. I ordered a everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. The bagel was toasted perfectly and was very delicious. I was also very impressed with the jalapeño cream cheese. They could've added a little more cream cheese though (they kind of skimped me on that, but it's an easy fix!).  The coffee was nothing special, just coffee. The man that took my order was very nice. The place was very clean but not a single person in there at 7:30am and its a bagel shop? I almost thought it may be closed. I really just didn't understand. I will defiantly be back and this will probably be my new bagel stop for some mornings. Also reasonably priced $5.10 for a bagel and coffee (cheaper than enstiens and WAY better). If you have ever had Hot bagels in north Phoenix the bagels are very similar."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix I've had so far! (I've lived here 7 years now and Barros was my previous fave). 5 stars! I work around the corner and will be frequenting this place for lunch from now on. Keep it up :)"}
{"text":"This is a new little place tucked away in the CBIZ plaza on the corner of Central Ave and Earll across from Park Central.  I work in the plaza and have eaten here several times and overall am a fan.  The breads and rolls are always fresh and the meat and cheese is Boar's Head and very good quality.  The peppered turkey is great.  The bagels are huge and very tasty.  They toast up nice and crispy, not heavy and dense like a lot of places.  These are good bagels and homemade smear is available in several flavors.   I had a lunch size personal pizza and it was not bad.  Not great, nothing to write home about but good.  I have also had the egg salad sandwich, it's slightly bland and could use some seasoning like celery salt and black pepper.  I would even love maybe chopped celery and/or onion but it was very fresh and that speaks volumes in and of itself.  I had a BLT today and the bacon was crispy and delicious.  The only thing that threw me off was they didn't toast the bread.  I have never in 40+ish years had a BLT that was not toasted.  It made it a little hard to eat but again, the quality of the bacon and freshness of the bread and lettuce and tomato made it great.  For the record, a BLT should always be served on toasted bread unless requested otherwise.  And finally to wrap it up, I ordered a pizza to go for dinner this evening.  I ordered the Monster Pie just the way it comes in the 16\" version.  IT IS FANTASTIC.  The crust is perfect, slightly crispy and not at all soggy.  The sauce is really good!!  It's so flavorful yet not sweet or overly spicy, just a very fresh tasting balanced sauce with herbs.  The toppings are also very good quality and we are super happy to have this for our dinner tonight.  Please give this locally owned family business a try.    And in response to the very first reviewer Alexx... you can actually ask for just the sandwich and they do adjust the price.  I have witnessed it with my own eyes.  The menu clearly states the price listed includes a drink and chips if ordering a sandwich.  All you have to do is ask for just the sandwich.  That's on you.  I can't speak about the phone number issue, I have called and gotten through.  Maybe the printer messed up on some of them and it was not caught in time.  Getting the phone number right is important, valid point."}
