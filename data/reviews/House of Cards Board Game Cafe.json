{"text":"Wandered in last night after putting the kids to bed. We were pleasantly surprised with the selection of games and settled on Food Fight... a simple trivia game that was enjoyable even though we did a LOT of guessing. Didn't end up ordering food , which was cool that there was no pressure to do so. The admission fee was perfectly reasonable. The space could use a bit more personality, but it's adequate (well lit, great location and hours). I'll have to return with a larger group sometime for more game options. I'll also be sure to give the menu a try. All in all... An hour well spent!"}
{"text":"We've tried a few board game cafés now. This one was a decent place. The price is $2 per hour, which is more expensive than Toronto cafés.  City parking lots in the area was free in evenings and weekends, so overall it was about the same cost. The game selection was not as impressive as other cafés, but the popular ones were there. The staff were helpful and made suggestions for games to play. We tried the chocolate milk shake and a vanilla latte; both were average restaurant (expensive) prices but were good.  Fries were decent, crispy and not over cooked. We likes this better than Decode in Mississauga. The location is in the heart of downtown Brampton and more likely to see walk-in traffic.  This had more of a warmer atmosphere.  We would come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here once after the Brampton Christmas Market was on in November.  Given this, HoC was quite busy.  But the service was still subpar.  Only 4 staff for an expected busy night??  We waited a while to be served.  Once we caught our server's attention we ordered two glasses of wine and an order of fries.  The wine was a good portion for the price...but it came in a dirty glass!  There were lipstick stains around the glass and they weren't mine!  Once I mentioned to one of the servers and asked for a fresh glass of wine, she followed through.  A good selection of games, but when I asked staff how to play Ticket to Ride, he said he didn't know about this game.  We were able to play games by reading the instructions ourselves.  The washroom needs to be checked on at night.  Ladies washroom ran out of TP in a stall.  Good thing I walk with tissues in my purse.  All-in-all, it's one of the more fun places to be in Downtown Brampton at night as its open late so I probably will return.  But I hope with time, they'll get their ducks in a row!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hang out. They have a very good selection of board games and the staff is super nice. The food and drinks are reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Updated to add that they have stopped serving anything but desserts, coffee, and boozy desserts and coffee (whee!). The fryer isn't used as often, adn the last time I was there I left smelling the same as when I went in, and my eyes weren't stinging. It was a relief, because I want to go back more often. I'll be doing that very soon. Great work!"}
{"text":"It's a nice hangout place, mainly full of teenagers to young adults in the night time. Their collection of games is so-so compared to other places I've been and the decor is kind of bland but the price is only around 2$ an hour so it's a great place for a night with friends. Overall a fun experience and if you go definitely try the s'mores dip, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Gotta pay $2 per hour per person.  Very limited menu and a little bit pricey.  I ordered cheesecake 4$ (typical cheesecake youll get from costco/wmart) My friend ordered vanilla milkshake (5$+ taxes) which tastes nothing special..  Free wifi? It's a lie lol. Doesnt work at all.  I think its worth a try and good hangout place with friends. But disappointed at the items on menu."}
{"text":"Overall the place was ok. Curb appeal isn't anything special when me and my friend arrived. We were actually debating whether we should go in before we stepped in the building. Once we walked in, we waited a little bit for the waitress to come out and explain to us how this worked. $2 per person per hour,seemed reasonable.   We sat down in the back closest to the games, which soon got very cold. Their game selection is vast and very nostalgic. Games ranging in difficulty is how they are sorted which is pretty nifty. We picked life stories, a polar ice breaking game, and quelf (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)  Food wise, this is what really brought them down. My friend ordered a waffle with ice cream and chocolate drizzle. She said it was good. I ordered a corona, \"chicken fingers\" and fries. Worst mistake. The chicken tasted burnt and overall didn't taste...right? But I politely asked to change my order to a corn dog and a plain NY cheesecake and she nicely swapped it out for me. My food came out and my corn dog was burnt. At this time I just drank my beer and ate my cheesecake because I was fed up with the food.   But the games we played definitely out-wayed the food and made for a fun night. More people came in after we did and soon the place was full with people. Overall I would go back with a larger group and only go for a beer and dessert."}
{"text":"This place has a huge variety of board games which range from the old school snakes and ladders and UNO to the newer ones like apples to apples and sorry. The best part is that they charge only $2 per hour per person.  What I did not like about this place is that the quality of food is very average and it is over priced. Overall you are better off coming here just to play the games and have a good time and avoid eating."}
