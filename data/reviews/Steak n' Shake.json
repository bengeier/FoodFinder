{"text":"For the most part, the people working here are nice. I was so excited to get a Steak n' Shake at this location but they close at 9pm. Steak n' Shake, at least for me, is late-night food. Also, the drive-thru runs very long, so you have to make a time commitment to go here."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow dine-in, carry-out, and drive thru. The sad thing is that they have 18 visible employees right now and 4 are hanging out by the register doing nothing. Meanwhile the drive thru is 8 cars deep and carry out orders are backed up.  It highlights the complete lack of leadership from the managers down. Don't come and expect to leave with food in hand in under 30 minutes. Oh, and they ask you if you'd like to leave a tip at the carry out to boot!"}
{"text":"15 minutes in the drive thru and no end in sight.  The new burger being advertised you can't get in the drive thru for some reason. I am stuck in the drive thru!"}
{"text":"The drive thru takes way too long. The food is good but why does the drive thru take so long?"}
{"text":"Have attempted a visit 3x, only to leave at the first opening to get out of the drive-thru line after waiting 30min+ the first & 20min the second. The third time was on my day off so I stuck around-30min in drive-thru for a shake! Menu is not the same either. I won't stop again til I hear they have their ish together!"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would! Disgusting! Wait was very long. Only to get the food and my daughter found a dead bug in her drink. Prior to that fries were cold and disgusting. Emailing corporate.   Update: The restaurant is now closed."}
{"text":"This Steak n' Shake has been constantly improving customer satisfaction. Today I ordered uber eats from this location and there was a problem with the app, however the manager took it upon himself to invite me to the restaurant and gave me a free, delicious meal! The staff was so welcoming and kind and really made my day, the night before I was in the ER until 4am, didn't eat the day before and the experience they gave me made my week. I will be back with friends! Thankyou!!"}
{"text":"So at 8:40pm we were told we could only order take out, even though the hours are from 10am to 10pm; and there also were patrons still eating in the dining area.  I'm thinking this is a franchise and as a franchise there are requirements to abide by within the franchise agreement.  I'm sure the agreement does not require the restaurant to close the dining area 1-hour and 20-minutes prior to closing. Needless to say we left and went elsewhere.   I will follow up with a letter to corporate."}
{"text":"BEWARE, THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!! Just TERRIBLE! DON'T EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!!!! Absolute terrible nigger service, just what a shame. Been waiting at the drive thru for 20 minutes with just two cars in front of me. In the same amount of time it took to get my meal from here, I could have just walked back into Walmart with a bunch of niggers inside, grab the shit I needed, go back home and cook a much more satisfying burger and fries and watched a fucking movie with my white self. My burger (AND FRIES TOO!!! HOW! WHY!!) were cold, too. The nigger person at the window told me service is slow when it's busy. THERE WEREN'T EVEN PEOPLE INSIDE!!!!!!!! Just rude, lying nigger management. Just absolute horrible service. It's run by only worthless, no-value nigger retarded niggers with no education who don't have any hint of common sense. Never ever going to this nigger place again. NEVER EVER! People beware!!!! Terrible terrible!! Just bad, HORRIBLE NIGGERS! This place does NOT DESERVE ANY STARRRR!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit slow but they are new. Friendly staff. Great food for the price. We were there on Valentines Day. They were packed and a long drive thru line. I'll be back after a couple weeks when they are more experienced."}
{"text":"I had two cars in front of me in the drive through and it was a 25 minute wait. When you pulled up to the spot to order they continued to tell me to \"hold on for a brief minute\" for almost 10 minutes. As I passed the building it was completely empty inside. This was 3pm on a Sunday. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Thought I would try out the place since I pass by it for work almost everyday. I tried going through drive through but after waiting ten minutes and not getting anywhere, I decided to just order inside.   It ended up taking even longer to wait and get my food because it doesn't seem like there's any organisation. I got half of my meal and was waiting on a milkshake, but after telling one of the employees working the front he said he world make it himself he then proceeded to figure out a customer situation and ring up a couple customers while occasionally glancing at me to see if I would say anything. I'm only one customer but at least telling someone about my milkshake would've been great. I eventually got it from another employee.   Overall, food is good and there are coupons you can use! Just don't count on the customer service."}
{"text":"Been in the drive thru for 20 minutes!!!! The customer ahead of me are complaining to the people at the pick up windows and they employees are arguing back!!! Do not come here!"}
{"text":"This Steak 'n Shake is absolutely terrible. The 3x I have come here I have been extremely disappointed each time. I am here now and the drive thru has taken more than 20 minutes and I have yet to reach the window. I started as 5th car. It took 5 minutes for me to be approached on the speaker. I am 3 cars from the window and if I could pull out the line, I would. Not to mention a worker outside told me they closed the inside already. I was so happy to get a Steak 'n Shake in this area but this Steak 'n Shake has slow, lazy workers with poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great food but Don't go through the drive thru. After 20 minute wait. Guy opens window and says \"here you go\" and hands me my phone. No, I'm sorry, thank you. Clueless management"}
{"text":"I like a simple burger and Steak and Shake can fit the bill. Food here was fine. The kitchen staff and management needs to get their act together! Yesterday at lunch, there were 5 tables that got up and walked out because they had waited an hour for their food. All the manager was doing was raising his hands and saying I told you and then walked outside to shut down the drive thru. He never got on the line and trained his cooks. It took another waiter and our waiter Chaz, who had just gone on shift, to jump on the line and make our food themselves. If I were the owner, I would toss the manager and put Chaz in charge."}
{"text":"Opening week, so they were packed and staff was still settling in. We sat in the booth by the claw game and it was like a wind tunnel when heating cooling system is on. The wind blew placemats off our table. Steak'n Shake is exactly what you expect, small burgers, thin fries, and tasty shakes. It's cheap, quick and easy.  3/7/17  Went in to get shakes. They were not busy and Keisha took my order quickly and with a warm smile. Almost 40 minutes later, I got my order. I don't know how they can be that slow. My wife joked they must have mixed them with a toothpick."}
{"text":"Confession: I have a weak spot for Frisco sauce.  That stuff is delicious.  The last few cities I've lived in have had a Steak n' Shake, and I have to admit it's one of my favorite fast food spots.  Perhaps the fast part should be in quotation marks, because every Steak n' Shake I've been to has weirdly slow; don't expect a super fast experience through the drive through.  This location is opposite of most in that shakes tend to be made quickly, and burgers are the hold-up.  Everyone we've talked to there has been very friendly, although we had one issue with order accuracy and had to go back into the restaurant to get it fixed, and one instance where the drive-thru inexplicably closed 20 minutes early while we were in line.  Drawbacks aside-- and hopefully some of them are new franchise jitters-- for the price, it's good food.  The shakes are delicious, and the burgers manage to stay juicy despite their thin size.  As I mentioned above, I'm partial to anything with their Frisco sauce, either the melt or the sliders.  My husband likes the garlic burger and a few other options.  Their skinny fries are always nice and crispy.  You can get a lot of the combos for under $4 and all of them for under $7, so it's a good deal.  This should be a two-star review.  However, I know I'm going to be a frequent customer so giving them two stars seems hypocritical-- I'm rounding up to three."}
{"text":"Came in at lunch time on a Saturday and it took a bit to order but the real problem was waiting 45 minutes for food.  Several tables full of people just got up and left,  some having already ordered and some who hadn't. Severely understaffed and disorganized. Got the food but not the shakes.  Lady complaining it took her 40 minutes in the drive through.  Never coming back. We spoke to the owner who said yesterday was payday so many of his employees didn't show up for work. Sounds like his problem not mine. Assistant manager was explaining to another party that she could not comp a large party their shakes that were ready long after they all finished eating. They either had to pay for them or cancel the order though they were all ready..... then said basically that she didn't care anymore because she just got in and people are all mad and going to be demanding free food all night....What a mess!"}
{"text":"I love Steak N Shake but this location has to be the slowest one I have ever been to! I just don't understand why it takes so long with the drive thru! I live near this location and have come a few times and every time I have come and used the drive thru, it took at least 25 minutes to get through. The last time we ate inside it took a while for them to bring our food. The food was great but the wait times are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went to eat in today and with our burgers my friend ordered a shake. We got our food but his shake didn't come. After he asked about it, it still didn't come. It came after our meal was finished. While paying my friend asked for the mgr 3 times in which the asst mgr finally showed. My friend told him that he didn't think he should pay for the shake since it came after we were done. The asst mgr said \"So you went ahead and started drinking it?\"  That was it, and after he said that he was trying to do the job of 10 people. My friend gave him the half drunken shake and we walked out. Not only does the crew need serious training, though they are nice, the managers need it also. The crew is only as good as the mgr."}
{"text":"If this place stays in business for more than a month I will be surprised. Don't waste your time, this place is awful, 30 minutes I waited before I asked for refund and walked out. Don't say I didn't warn you"}
{"text":"Wait staff is prompt to get your order but the kitchen has bad time management for orders. I could see the orders on the kiosk the needed to be served both the drive through and dine in was full. The drive through side cleared but internal orders remained. Poor management. They need to take a lesson from In and Out burger franchise. Meanwhile I am still waiting 45 minutes and here finally are the milkshakes.  waitress states only one person cooking."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was sooooo slow! I have been to this location multiple times, and every time I got through the drive through, it takes at least 15 min."}
{"text":"Jeez. Waited in the drive through for 30 minutes then waited at the window for another 10-15 to get my food. There were only three cars ahead of me. The food was good but never going to this location again"}
{"text":"If you plan on coming here, DON'T go through the drive thru! there really is no reason why the drive thru is that slow. there could be only 3 cars but the wait might be 15-30 mins, too long in my opinion. i seen cars back from the line cause they were waiting too long. i have no clue what they were doing inside that makes them so slow. i understand they are new, but they should still have things in order and not have people wait that long if its supposed to be fast food. The frisco melt is what i always get, that was good. its just the wait to order the food made me mad."}
{"text":"The staff is actually very nice but it takes forever! I waited 40 minutes in the drive thru line. If I could have exited, I would have. By the time we got our food, the burgers were cold. The fries were hot though. The food is very good but not when it's cold and takes forever!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times and each time seems like it's opening day. While the employees have been nice and the food decent, the service is INSANELY SLOW!!!! you can tell they definitely need more training which is a management problem. Fast food? Not even close. Also, I've only been through the drive-thru. Have not gone inside."}
{"text":"absolutely no surprise this place shut down .. each & every chance we gave this place (hoping it would be better) was a disappointment .. once after getting our drinks (after which I was SCREAMED at so I knew mine did not have a free re-fill .. lime-aid) we waited another 40 minutes & never got our food .. the franchisee owner was there & actually made us pay for our drinks despite saying we were leaving due to not getting our food in a quick manner .. RIDICULOUS! .. TOO BAD TOO .. having a location close to home was a bonus .. until we stopped going .. maybe someone else will take it over or perhaps corporate will take it over & make the improvements needed to open it back up .. if not Swenson's opened just a few blocks away so there is another option"}
{"text":"Th business is CLOSED!  Went there today and there was a construction dumpster outside. Too bad as they were only open for about 11 months. But I am not surprised as they never seemed to get it together. As I understand it this was the first non-company franchise store in the area"}
{"text":"OMG. Some lady with a doo rag just came out of the kitchen to our table to inform us that the WAITER is cooking our food. Been here an hour now and not seen food brought out to any of the tables (those that haven't walked out in frustration, that is). Just drinks for the dining room customers with food being prepared for drive through and carry out business.  This is the sorriest place ever! Awful. Stay away."}
{"text":"The worst steak and shake I ever went to. When I heard one was opening up closer to home I was so excited, might as well be closed. I have come here numerous time to dine in and drive thru. The shortest wait time I've ever had in the drive thru is 45 minutes, and that was with only 2 cars ahead of me. Dining in is horrible. The staff aren't the nicest, and they don't check back up on you. If you want a refill for your drink you're better off drinking your spit. I only had nice service once, but I never saw the young man who provided the good service again."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this location... i love Steak and Shake but this location is horrible.. slow service, rude staff, cold food, warm milkshake!!! Id rather drive to the one in macedonia"}
{"text":"Extremely slow, took 10 minutes to get a server. Had to chase someone down to get a server, the lady that say us never checked back in, talked to her friend instead. Took about 20 minutes for patty melt, chicken tenders and grilled cheese. Food finally came fries were over cooked and hard, I was brought a patty melt instead of a grilled cheese. Waiter proceeded to argue me down about the difference between a grilled cheese and grilled patty melt, even after I showed him the menu. Finally received the order with fresh uncooked fries.  Got bill spent $15 added on kids meal even though it was supposed to be free. Had to ask for manager she didn't look like care about our issue or her life...Will not be coming back or recommending"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Nothing has changed. Period. How does it take an army and hours of time to do nothing? You have your answer!  30 minutes for a fast food drive thru is unacceptable at worst, and at best laughable. The owner is there all the time. He doesn't care. If he did, something would have changed in the last 9 months.   30 minutes for a shake. The people in front of me, 35 minutes for some food. You can drive to Walmart next store, buy a meal, microwave it, eat it, and you might even have enough time to come back and pick up your food.   WHAT A JOKE!  ### Previous Review:  Unacceptable - Extremely rude managers, untrained staff, lack of awareness by the owner (who lurks in the back barking out orders). Was repeatedly asked to wait between 5-10mins to simply place a carry out order, when I could have just waited in the drive thru. People spend more time arguing over coupons than anything else - and I'm talking about the customers...  Place is clean though and food is good."}
{"text":"If i could give them zero stars I would. I'm a big fan of Steak 'n Shake and been to many locations but this was THE WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We waited TWO HOURS to get our burgers! That's pretty unacceptable considering it's a restaurant that also has a drive through! On top of that they served several tables that had come in after us before we got our food. We didn't order anything complicated just original steak burgers so why they served burgers to them before us I have no idea. Honestly we would have left much sooner but they kept telling us \"you're foods about to come out\". Then when we finally got our food only three burgers came out (there were five of us) and they messed up ALL of our orders (onions instead of pickles, forgot to add cheese etc). We eventually found out that they completely lost our ticket and we were so fed up at this point we just left without getting our food and we still paid for our sodas which really they should have comped considering the whole experience. On top of all that the attitudes of many of the employees were terrible. Overall a pretty horrific experience."}
