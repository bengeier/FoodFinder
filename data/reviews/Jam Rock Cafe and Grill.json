{"text":"Came to have dinner at 6pm on a Friday. They never gave us a menu, but stated they only had oxtail and jerk chicken left, which is unforunate because a lot of items listed on their online menu sounded good. I requested rice and peas, but received rice and cabbage, both of which lacked seasoning. Meals were served in to-go boxes instead of plates for dining in, which is was my original intention. I took my food to go, and left. Overall, it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This review is tough for me, since I've been to Jamaica and LOVE reggae music. Went for a show on a Saturday night. Tickets were 15 bucks, which would seem cheap, however the sound system was so poor that there was constant feedback hurting people's ears. Hard to enjoy what you paid for. Also, DJ was really annoying. Playing annoying sounds and talking during bands playing. I hate that. 

The service....was something I had never seen before in my life. There was a bartender trying to work hard. It was somewhat busy and she was trying her best. There was another \"bartender\" sitting down. We didn't know what her roll was. She did occasionally stand up and open a beer for someone, but then would ask the 1 bartender that knew what to do questions, and slowing her down. I actually saw the head bartender trying to make her own drinks while pouring alcohol in the other ladies cup since she didn't know what to do. The head bartender was also running food. Even though there were only like 10 tables and a few waitresses. Just really unorthodox. Red Strips were 5 bucks. Over priced since most reggae shows sell those for 2 or 3 bucks. Over priced for such terrible service. 

I sooooo wanted to try the food!! I've heard it's great! From what little food I did see come out of the kitchen, it looked good! I asked waitress if they were still serving food and she basically said the wait was so long, it wouldn't be worth it. That is also a first for me. 
They have this beautiful patio area with a big bar that wasn't even being used. Would have alleviated the craziness inside.   
Maybe I would go back? During lunch time on a weekday maybe? Not sure"}
{"text":"Food was plain, no flavor. Seemed like they couldnt find my order. Threw everything in one container when it was two separate meals. Paid $3 for 3 small pieces of plantains. My experience was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and reggae music playing. and always quiet . Would love to see live  reggae music"}
{"text":"First time here and am very satisfied with what I had. Ordered the Jerk wings and the flavor blew me away. The menu has great selection of Jamaican style cooking. Not too large of a menu makes choosing what you want easy. Great place to come after a concert. If I didn't have a late lunch, would have tried the Oxtail entree. Next time."}
{"text":"No one picks up phone. Not even sure if phone line still works now. If the location is shut down, can this please be listed and shown as closed to not waste consumers time. Worst thing u can do is have someone show up and u aren't in business anymore."}
{"text":"Why is this place not packed on a Saturday night just on the music alone.  People in AZ be sleeping on hidden gems.  Guarantee if it were anywhere else it would be a line out the door.  

The food is so freaking good ended up taking a plate to go as well. We had jerk chicken,plantains, rice & peas.  Oh yeah let's not forget about the rum punch!! The waitress was so nice and our order was ready in know time.  

I will definitely return and will tell everyone i know to give them a try."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!ordered a chicken ceasar on my lunch.... Took 20 min for a salad and when it came there is nothing but some nasty ass jerk chicken which consisted of all brown meat. Chickens have white meat and this salad consisted of only ONLY gross dark meat chicken. Yelp you let me down on this one , I was looking the previous place funky food which is STILL listed. DO NOT TRY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im a sucker for Jamaican Beef pies so I tried really hard to like this place, but unfortunately that's not possible. First off, I drove quite a distance to this place because their online hours said they would be open, when I arrived doors were locked. The next time I tried it was the same thing. It was Tuesday afternoon, no special holiday, still no staff. The next time I called before I made the treck and someone answered! I asked if they had beef patties available and they said yes. I told them I was on my way. I got there about 10 minutes later and when I arrived there was a lady cleaning the glass door outside. She must have just started because she kept me waiting behind her for a good 5 minutes while she finished. It's AZ so 5 mins in the heat can get a little warm. No biggie though, i get it. Finally she is finished and I am what i hope is minutes away from a tasty beef patty. Nope. The restaurant is empty, and a very friendly guy comes out and shakes my hand with a long shake (the kind where you shake, then cup hands then pound fist then explode fist) I'm thinking cool vibe, I tell him I want two patties, no actually on account of that friendly handshake and the fact the place was dead, I said make it 6 patties, I'll take some home to the family and to eat later. He says they aren't ready yet but give him 15-20 mins. Alright not a big deal, I'll wait for fresh juicy beef patties, I've tried twice already what's 15 minutes?? The friendly guy disappears to the kitchen and the girl who was washing the window came out and turned on the T.V.'s which where set to some Reggae stations, I'm thinking cool, should help pass the time....and then she puts the two T.V.'s sound on the stereo system and turns it to full blast. When I say full blast I mean violent make your ears bleed full blast. I'm passive aggressive so my way to try and get her to turn it down was to pretend to get a phone call and have to yell into the phone to speak. I keep saying, \"I'M SORRY, I CANT HEAR YOU, ITS REALLY LOUD WHERE I AM\"
Nothing....she doesn't flinch. At this point I'm counting down the time, hoping its 15 minutes rather then 20. At one point the friendly guy who disappeared came out briefly to grope and sloppily kiss the girl. They both then disappear. 15 mins goes by, 20, then 30. I stand up at this point hoping someone will come out to talk to me and give me a status update....nothing. I start to yell, EXCUSE ME, HELLO, EXCUSE ME, HELLO....nothing! It's so damn loud my voice is buried in the dancehall. I try to open and close the front door which had a chime on it and finally the guy pokes his head out with a smile nonetheless, I say, \"HEY MAN IM IN A REAL RUSH, HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THEY BE?\" He puts up 5 fingers then bobs his head back into the abyss. 35 mins, 40, 45mims pass. I open and close the front door again to get him back out and it works, he pokes his head out and holds up 1 finger. 15 minutes later he comes out with the patties on a plate. I figured since I ordered 6 and that I was obviously in a rush to leave he would have realized they needed to be packed. He disappears again, and 5 mins later comes out with them bagged up. He charges me close to 30 bucks, which at this point I know is really high but I have no patience to argue. After swiping my card he turns the white square screen towards me to enter in a tip, I just turn it right back to him. His face goes from smiles to upset then he says \"aight den\" he swings the screen back, i sign and leave. On my way out he says \"NO TANKS!\"  Look, I really wanted to like this place, that girl, and that guy, but the service was the worst is ever seen. I really wondered if I was on a hidden camera show to see just how much I would take before walking out.  Now to the patties, you won't believe this, they were actually decent. I hated liking them. I love beef patties, these were not bad, but I will NEVER be back. Thanks for driving me to drink that afternoon JamRock Shitty Service, Not Bad Patties Cafe!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Jam Rock Cafe and they've really earned a place in my heart. The staff are so endearing and I love the authenticity. The jerk chicken tastes like the jerk chicken I had at a roadside jerk hut in Jamaica! Also, the patties - I love the patties!

This time, I tried the Rum Punch and I could easily spend a whole evening sipping on that delicious fruity cocktail. We gathered with friends outside in the spacious patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather. 

Not everything in this establishment goes off without a hitch, but the food, drinks, and service are worth any hiccups along the way."}
{"text":"Servicew was good and the music added to make it a fun night. Curry goat was my favorite and my wife had the jerk chicken. We will be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here everyday! My coworker and I decided to try this little restaurant beat our office. We were not disappointed! I ordered the curry chicken, which fell right off the bone and was delicious with potatoes in the curry. I also had the \"rice and peas\" which is rice with some beans in there, also delicious. We had sides of plantains, perfectly cooked. They have other dishes I'd love to try, such as deep fried cornbread, jerk chicken, and a selection of Jamaican beers. We checked in on yelp and received 10% off. Definitely try this restaurant! They have a much more extensive menu than the picture of the menu that's here on yelp."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin. The alcohol drinks mmmmmuah to die for. The jerk chicken was a very generous portion and came with a side of steamed veggies and peas and rice. Best Jamaican food in Phoenix ao far for me.

Its is a bit odd walking into the building, however once you round that final corner and enter the main dining area it feels like u are tranaported to a place on the east coast due to the exposed brick and minimal decor. I loved it.

The staff was absolutely wonderful.  They were very attentive and even gave my son and nephew free cookies while we waited for our food to be prepared. 

I can't say enough good things about this place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"tl;dr : Good food, wonderfully gracious, kind employees, and a generally cool vibe at this little spot. 

My boyfriend and I went in on a Friday night--per the hours shown on here I thought they were open until 10pm and I made a reservation since it was an option and we had never been here before--wasn't sure if it got busy enough to need a reservation or not, and I like to play it safe. I made the reservation for 8pm. 

We sat down just before 8 and were the only people there, which I thought was a little weird, but figured it was just a slow night. 

The waitress was so sweet right off the bat and an older gentleman who I think was the cook was standing out in the dining area and introduced himself, shook our hands and said hello. I really liked the vibe just from that--very personal and welcoming. 

We ordered and after the waitress put in our order she brought out the check, but assured us we were in no hurry, but she just wanted to bring it because they were closing the register. I suddenly realized (being a server before) that they were closing! I confirmed that they were and apologized profusely, letting them know that on Yelp it showed that they were open until 10, mostly wanting to let them know why we came when we did so they didn't think we were super rude/thoughtless! 

They were incredibly gracious and kind about it and didn't make us feel like a bother at all. They brought out the food in takeout boxes, understandably! And honestly, I've seen other reviews stating that they were served food in takeout boxes even during the day, due to running out of plates, etc.--I truly wouldn't have minded even if that were the case. There's something about a \"mom & pop shop\" that just feels more authentic, I guess. I personally don't mind that at all--if you're going to some fancy, 5-star restaurant I wouldn't appreciate that, but a cool little spot like this, I really have no problem with little hiccups like that. :-) 

After we realized they were closed my boyfriend finished up his drink and we took our food--we were mostly done anyway! The cook came back out to ask us how the food was (which it was great, by the way!) and the guy closing down the register (maybe the manager/owner?) answered our questions about their live music nights and welcomed us back soon. 

I don't write many reviews for places, but I wanted to for them because not only was the food quite delicious, they were so kind despite us unknowingly showing up minutes before they were going to close!"}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because just about everything was perfect but I absolutely could not get through more than 3 bites of anything with the Jerk sauce on it.  

I'd give the food a 3 starts, that extra star is there because the ambiance is pretty damn neat :)

My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered the stewed chicken meal with rice and peas and fried yams.  The fried yams were absolutely disgusting - honestly, one bite, my face screwed up.  Gave it another bite to ensure I didn't have a bad one - same face.  Boyfriend tries it: \"Maybe we should try the Plantain next time instead\" lol... I agree!  The stewed chicken was scrumptious!  I must say .. I think I like Jerk Hut's stewed chicken a little better.

My boyfriend ordered the Curry goat dinner with festivals and rice and beans.  WE LOVED the curry goat.  Nice pieces of meat on the bones, in comparison to Jerk Hut - lots of bones in goat meals.  We also enjoyed the festivals a lot more than we did at Jerk Hut."}
{"text":"Oh wow the food was absolutely amazing.I had the ox tale stew my boyfriend had the fish sandwich and a couple of Jamaican sodas.The meat was so tender and the veggies was so flavorful.I will definitely go back again.The hostess was friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place besides its the bomb!! There aren't a ton of options for eating downtown so anytime a new place opens up I check it out. This one hits the spot. Jerk chicken was cooked perfectly and the food was ready quickly which is important when you are eating on your lunch hour. Red stripe for lunch too? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service would recommend to everyone i know absolutely wonderful Will definitely be back thanks to my wells Fargo buddy Sean Curtis for the recommendation best Jamaican food I have ever had"}
{"text":"The oxtail was excellent and the vegetables were fresh and cooked just right.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"RESTAURANT CLOSED @ 2:00pm ALTHOUGH THEY ADVERTISE AS BEING OPEN. This would have been my 1st time here. Drove 20 miles to get there. Doors were locked. I was met at the door by a grungy white male with no shoes on. He stated that they were closed today because they had a band last night. I will not patronize a business that does not have consistent business hours. We are trying The Caribbean Spice and will rate them instead."}
{"text":"Great food at a new location.   Stop for some great Jamaican jerk chicken.  
 
 Have been here three time now and haven't need disappointed, first of all you have to park in the back, which isn't great until I found out this 80+ year old building is on Phoenix historic registry and is one of the first if not the first strip mall in the city. 
So, in the 1930's parking would have been in the front but when the widened the road 50+ years ago they must have stole the parking.   

 Had the Jerk Chicken again and it was better then ever.   Everything is fresh made and takes a little to make so you may want to call ahead if you're in a hurry for lunch.    602-441-4588, Be adventurous, the maze to get in worked out fine."}
{"text":"Friendly and delicious. The delivery man actually came out during the flash flood. I ordered right before we recd the warnings."}
{"text":"Much nicer inside than expected, there is a menu of Caribbean dishes. The prices seemed a bit high for the neighborhood and portion size. My tilapia sandwich was small, and relied on the tartar sauce for most of the flavor. My side of fried plantains again consisted of just a few wedges and they were greasy and soft.

At checkout my bill was wrong as they tried to bill me for the included side.

I probblay will not be going back."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving bad reviews, but this time is an exception. When I went in for lunch, the place was practically empty. It took a very long time for the server to come back with our food, and it wasn't the best tasting Jamaican food that I have had. The rice tasted mediocre, like it was cooked before and left out for a long time before being served. I thought that I was the only one who thought that the place wasn't great, but the rest of my friends shared similar thoughts. I probably won't go again."}
{"text":"Seeing all the great reviews I wish I could try this place. Being from the east coast I found good food places are hard to find here. With my car being shipped here I will have to wait because a $20 minimum to deliver is outrageous. Hopefully I can change the rating when my car gets here."}
{"text":"Over priced. They ran out of food and plates!! This is the second time that something!!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk pasta with chicken. Very spicy but REALLY GOOD! The customer service was stellar and the live music was really good!"}
{"text":"PreParty opening night went off without a hitch. Great service food and music... Spice up your life a bite with a little Jamaican jerk chicken or the oxtail which was off the hook  so tender and delicious! Definitely will be a frequent repeat costumer ! We be jamin'"}
{"text":"We had a very nice time at this establishment last Friday night, eating the good Caribbean food, drinking Jamaican beer, and listening to the Reggae bands brought back fond memories of the Bay Area Jamaican Dance Clubs. I can see the clientele has picked up quite nicely, with entire families to attractive single women dropping in to grab a Friday night dinner and hear the bands. The waitress staff was quick and very attentive, and I chuckled to myself about the standing room only in parts of the restaurant because of the visiting bands. They even have security watching over the parking lot. The Jam Rock Brewing Co. is evolving into a very enjoyable Caribbean restaurant and Reggae Club, and I look forward to the day when they hit full maturity in their craft. The music, the food, the beer, along with the ambiance had me bobbing my head to the beat while sharing a good time with my lovely wife. Respect..."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the oxtail and it was large. The rice and peas were authentic and stem veggies were good. My friend ordered the fish sandwich and that was good too. The only thing we did not like was the fried cornbread. It was look a hush puppy but not vey good. The wait staff was very attentive. The prices were good too. You should give it a try."}
{"text":"So, went last night for a show to listen to some good music. Music was good. Vibes were cool. Customer service suuuuucked. It took 20 min to even be looked at in our direction. It was still dead in there. We got there before anyone else did. The bar tender girl was a spazzzz. When she finally acknowledged me I asked for 2 Red Stripes and a Jamrock margarita. She said \"we don't have that\" I said \"oh, your menu says you do\" she grabbed the menu and said \"I guess I can make you some type of margarita\" I said \"uh, ok. What kind of tequila do you have\" she rolled her eyes and said \"bar tequila\" I had no idea what that even meant so I played it safe and just said \"I'll just have a Bud Light.\" I handed her my card and she grabbed it and started talking to someone while my card was in her hand for like 5 minutes. She then said, \"so just the Bud Light?\" I smiled because She almost didn't charge me for the two Red Stripes but I was honest and said \"and the two Red Stripes.\" I didn't buy anymore because the group of people I was with kept having to wait 10 minutes or more for beer from her so we got over it real quick and left after the first act. We were going to try the food but didn't want to have to wait 30 min to even get our order in. We had dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite restaurants to go. The oxtail, curry goat and brown stew chicken!!!! I love them!!! These three items are a must try! You have to trust my taste cuz I eat everything. Of course lol I'm Chinese ;) oh well not trying to be funny, but give it a try. You won't forget!"}
{"text":"Wonderful location for a restaurant now that more businesses are opening on that section of Van Buren.  Nice decor inside, they cater to a diverse clientele.  There is a bar and two wide screens for the sports crowd, there are music nights for the outgoing crowd, and there is a connected space next door where they sell raiment.  What baffles me though is why there are so many employees in the restaurant.  Even with a full house, they wouldn't need that many on payroll.  

The food is typical Jamaican.  The only thing on the menu that varies from day to day is the dessert.  And the desserts are always a surprise to the taste buds. 

Not much for a vegetarian.  Salad with iceberg lettuce (no thanks), steamed veggies (okay, but what do I eat them with?), or veggie stew which is quite tasty but all the coconut milk leaked out of the to go container.  Then there are the plantains that will cost you $3 for 4-5 small slices.

And if you want fish, don't bother with the happy hour fish taco.  I got one bite (literally one bite) of fish crumbled up in the bottom of the shell and that was covered up with iceberg lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  Or for $9 how about a fish sandwich (breaded fish, onion, tomato, lettuce, mayo, bread) that comes with one side.

It seems that oxtail and jerk chicken lovers would probably get more for their money at this restaurant.

By the way, if you're taking out call in your order ahead of time because it takes them a while to ready it."}
{"text":"Really hate to leave this review but, this is yelp and it calls for honesty. 

Parking is located in the back of the place and you enter through the outdoor patio into what seems like a maze to get to the front counter....like through 1 door back outside through another door then around the dining area to the counter.

There was myself and another woman placing a to go order and someone sitting in the dining area, not busy at all for lunch on a Friday. The waitress was new and seemed very nervous which is understandable it took her about 15mins to get me cashed out...no problem because I was still waiting on my order...that took another 15mins and they forgot my festival, I told them it was fine just give me rice and peas instead which I was told would take 2mins, 5 mins later out comes FESTIVAL.

Whatever, I'm running on my lunch hour being over so as I race back to the office I drive and eat....the steamed veggies were not seasoned well..the chicken itself was very moist but it's dark meat it's kind of hard to not have moist dark meat, that too wasn't well flavored, when I think of jerk chicken I think of marinading for hours or overnight to allow flavors to seep through...not the case here at all, tasted like simply grilled meat with a slightly watery jerk sauce on the side, that too unfortunately wasn't flavorful....and now the festival....it tasted like well - fried dough with cinnamon literally imagine mixing cornmeal, flour and cinnamon together and deep frying it...it was really bad.

This is brand spankin new so a longer soft opening is definitely necessary especially when dealing with us downtown folks during the lunch rush and after work dinner pickup, they need work.

While I won't be spending my $8 again on a meal from here I will say this, my ex & I attended LoLo's when they first opened many, many moons ago and the food was bad, the owner asked us for our honest opinion and we told him (we had just returned from LA's Roscoe's Chix & Waffles and had a taste for the combo when we stumbled on Lo Lo's) he in turn thanked us for our honesty said he would continue to work on his recipes and place in general and look at him now - he's a successful pretentious asshole, but Lo-Lo's has 2 locations, mission accomplished lol....maybe this place has potential too *shrugs*

I would give them 1 1/2 stars but I can't and don't feel like they're worthy of 2 stars at this point.

I refuse to believe the photo of the fried and grilled chicken belongs to them and came from their establishment....REFUSE"}
{"text":"All I can say is, \"Wow\"!  I literally felt like I was on the shores of Jamaica sipping the best Bahama Mamas one could find stateside!  We enjoyed every bite of our feast of Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, Plantains and Festivals!  And we experienced some of the most attentive and accommodating customer service one could ask for!  Two thumbs up!  They did a fantastic job representing the very best of what Jamaica has to offer!!  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Reverse racism at it's finest. We had a large group of 11 people and we all decided to meet here for dinner before going to see our friend DJ at another location. The service was slow but we were willing to overlook that. We all sat at a big table and never had a waitress come to our table at all. Finally, a woman came over to ask if we were there to see the band, we answered no and that we were there for some food. She flat out told us that we were not welcomed there and that we would have to leave, it was about 7:00pm and the band wasn't even on until 8 so we should have had plenty of time to get a quick bite and leave. We asked her if we were expected to stand up to eat and she responded that we can use the table but AS SOON as we are done we had to leave. We left embarrassed and very upset. I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to write this review but I figured I would help someone else out. I'd like to say this place has potential as with any place I'd love to see succeed. With that being said, this place is in a part of town I don't generally like to go but I was craving Jamaican food and didn't want to drive across town to my regular spot. There was parking in the back that allows you to enter through the back as well as the front.
I got one of the easiest Jamaican meals to make. Jerk chicken and rice and peas. The meal tasted as if someone looked up recipes of authentic food and was missing a few ingredients so they tried to improvise. As I type this my lips are burning and my nose is running and generally I'd be okay with this if my food had been good.
The customer service was poor,the wait time was long and I watched 2 people walk in and leave when they entered. The place was empty other than 2 gentlemen at the bar. They serve alcohol as well as regular soft drinks and have a small menu written in chalk. I'll end my review here with hopes that they get it together."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. Although it takes a lil time because it is made upon ordering it's more authentic than Breadfruit! Full bar is an added plus and the Caribbean drinks are delish. It's in central phoenix which is a plus and Wi-Fi is an added bonus. They sell island souvenirs and Rastafarian items. They even have live jazz on the weekends! Can't complain as they are still working out the kinks since they opened up last Monday. They are definitely in the right track!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Jamaican place right downtown across the street from where I work.  The jerk chicken was dry and loaded with ginger and allspice.  The sauce had great scotch bonnet peppers that had a sweet slow burn.  Fantastic rice and peas.  The coleslaw was jusy enough and not too wet.  AMAZING rum cake.  The mojitos were good and the live band was fun to dance to.  Kind of love it and not so sure it is good to have Appleton rum across the street from my work."}
{"text":"Because I know how hard starting & running a restaurant can be, I award an extra star on the heels of delicious food- primarily because I am so impressed at the 22yo employee Tyler we enjoyed some great service from!

Initially we were confused about whether or not the place was even open (6pm Superbowl Saturday night) because there only sat one lone soul at the bar, sure enough Tyler greets us at the door with an exasperated muttering about how he just ran an order up the street and that a bartender flaked out on work last minute ....and me being me just said \"So is that a YES?!\" I figured at the very least I was determined to see if staying for a full meal was warranted pending a taste of the salt fish fritters I had been craving since stumbling upon their menu on Yelp the night before. ... To my delight they came out hot, fresh, crispy and were definitely appetizing, (especially paired with a Red Stripe heehee). 

While checking in with a few snapshots of the boutique-like entry way and main dining room, an obviously annoyed, buxom-blonde-backup-barista (?) delivered food to our table, and again,  me being me was determined to turn her frown upside-down, so I pumped her for info on the history of the joint while we patiently waited on entrées... I swear this chick seems like the perfect addition to the next Quentin Tarantino movie I'd want to watch... After a few basic questions she went from zero to 60 in a flash and (without yelping your eyes out) in a nutshell she told us all about her funny relationship with her father and even crawled on the floor during this candid storytelling session... I'm just flattered to know I can get strangers to be so comfortable with opening up to me so quickly.... but Phoenix has proven to be full of quite \"chillaxed\" beings so I dunno how much credit I can really take for it. Long story short- I discovered this little gem had almost been lost forever until ambitious,  young Tyler stepped in to save it, and he seems truly passionate about keeping good food flowing and good service abound! 

Although I was told the oxtail would need another 15-20 minutes after I ordered it (twice), I in fact never received my entrée because they really did need an hour to be truly palatable,  I assured him that I was willing to wait for them, he was thoughtful enough to bring me a sample and even though they weren't falling off the bone I could taste \"the love\" and look forward to coming back for em! He also shared & sent us several complimentary shots of Appleton rum and I thoroughly enjoyed the beef patties (the crusty shell is awesome) and the stew chicken was realllly tasty, especially with the fried dumplings, aka \"Johnny cakes.\" 

The ONLY issue we had was when the side of rice & beans were (noticeably) dry/leftover from another day and slipped on to the plate, we immediately received a fresh order and it was great.   

Before we left we received some cards offering free appetizers! Good deal!

Having been brought up with a professional chef for a Grandma who makes the most amazing Jamaican food in the Universe,  I must say I'm looking forward to coming back and tasting the curry, oxtail and more. Definitely worth a visit! :)"}
