{"text":"Wait staff is terrific! Beer selection is terrific! Food selection is nothing special."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, got the hot pastrami and cheese \"samwich\" (its what made them famous, says it on the menu) and it was just ok.  The service was excellent though, probably cause we were the only ones there on a wed afternoon, but I was impressed.  I was there with a bunch of my friends and most waitresses try and stay as far away as they can, but she was awesome and made sure we had everything we needed.  Pretty much the only reason I went there and will go back is that they have a Big Buck Safari game that is logged in online so you can compete nationally, I love that game!  Their lunch specials are super cheap too, I think it was $6 for the \"samwich,\" frys and a drink."}
{"text":"These guys have amazing food!  We love to go there for Monday night football because they have this great game called the \"Hot Seat\", where you can win money!! We have been eating and drinking at Famous Sam's for over 10 years and we have never had a bad meal, and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"This not only the best neighborhood bar in Gilbert, the food is great too! The classic pastrami, fish sandwich and the sweet potato fries are top notch. Also, the bartenders rock! Especially Stan!! Ditch the pretentious places and go here for the booze and food!"}
{"text":"Famous Sams was EXCELLENT at accommodating a larger party (about 15). Kevin, Stan and Todd were beyond wonderful. No issues with the bills. Drinks were flowing and we had no complaints about the food. Overall, it was the perfect balance of a rowdy good time location. 100 thumbs up. :) and thank you to the staff!!!"}
{"text":"Food is very salty and overcooked.  If you like a \"Red neck Hillbilly haven\" then this is your place..."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite bar in Gilbert.  Friendly dive bar atmosphere and get this... It's not sticky.  All the bartenders are extremely nice and the owner is usually working.  After my first time there, they were already makingnan effort to remember my name.  The have trivia games available.  Everyone is friendly and there are always some kind of shot/drink special.  The drink selection is beyond impressive for beer.  They have over a dozen different beers on tap.  The bar is extremely long and there is always room for you and your group.  Hightop seating as well as booths and regular tables are also available however I rarely use them sincei prefer the bar seating.  There is 4 pool tables which are usually available, except of Fridays which is tournament night.  Karaoke is on Saturday but unfortunately everyone sucks.    You really can't go wrong with this bar.  Just remember this is a dive and not Mill Ave or Scottsdale.  Had my birthday party here this year, too bad I don't remember it."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. The staff really cares about their patrons. Good food and talented bartenders."}
{"text":"Great low key bar for a night out with the boys. Pool tables video games and a great pizza joint next door."}
{"text":"You'll never go thirsty here - the bartenders are very attentive. They market themselves as a sports bar, but the TV's are ancient and most are not even HD. The ones that are HD have permanent damage and are hard to watch. But if you spend 10 bucks UFC is free... Consistently decent bar food and consistently disgusting bathrooms. If you like (or don't mind) dive bars, this place is OK."}
{"text":"I went to this spot on Sunday March 10th they had nascar, and the USA Baseball Champions on TV.....ordered the Wings orginal Hot and these were the best wings I have had in 3 yrs.  Beautiful Little Bartender she was much fun.  My brother was being his usual pain in the butt flirting with her but she put up with it very nicely.  they serve everything with style and the place is easy on the eyes.  Take some friends and hang out lots of room and big fun in this place........Famous Sams......who loves ya baby"}
{"text":"They stopped having UFC fights on a regular basis, so won't be frequenting as much. I'm not happy about it but i guess times are hard. It's a shame :( I wish them success & maybe we'll be back again one day soon!?!?"}
{"text":"Ran in for a quick lunch, had the cheese burger special.  Good food at a fair price, bartender (Stephanie) is a great gal.  I've always had a good time!"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the only good thing about this place were the bloody Marys and the staff. The TVs were older and one was green. It SAYS on the website and on the MENU that they have a bloody Mary bar (the entire reason we went) but no, they tell you, \"we make it for you how u want\". No shit..so does every other bar. I want to make it my self! Not to mention the were $5 a piece and the first one had very little vodka. I ordered an omelet, one of 2 on the menu, and it was wrong, the have no ketchup bottles only cup served with your meal. We will never go back again.. there was no offer to correct my bill for the wrong food, I was asked if I wanted a new omelet but I was starving and not waiting another min. My husband was charger $1.00 for one slice of toast. Ugh..bad, bad business!!"}
{"text":"This Famous Sams off Ray is right around the corner from my home. So we go in there often but not because of the food and drinks,, but because it's close. There isn't another pub or bar for another 2miles. Sometimes the food specials on the white piece of paper are good but not consistent. Wings are good. Beer prices are good but the call liquor is outrageous. $4.25 for a cranberry and well vodka. If you order call vodka they add $2.25 to your bill. $6.50 for a neighborhood bar is crazy in my opinion. Usually I am charged .50 to $1 more, not $2.25.  I do like buzztime trivia and texas holdem. But until another bar comes out this way....."}
{"text":"4 stars for the bartenders. Def an entertaining group there!  Atmosphere: They have a lot of bar seating and high-top seating, so you usually can find a spot right away. They have regular booth restaurant seating...but why would anyone want to sit there? :)  It's extremely divey. Its nothing exciting to look at outside or inside...but its kept nice and clean. It's diveyness sometimes makes me feel out of place showing up here....But it always a good time here.   They have a great area to play pool and hangout with friends, except Fridays are busy with tournament games. Saturdays they have Karaoke, it is a hit or miss with that. They also have trivia!  Food is decent and cheap. I've only had some of their appetizers but it goes nicely with drinking and playing pool! They have a huge drink selection and with that, huge portioned drinks - from beer to hard alcohol drinks. And they are not shy about it!"}
{"text":"Just ok tonight. Food is usually pretty good here  though the combo basket was a little underwhelming.  Food is always hot and good portions. Place was overly warm and beer could have been a lot colder. Service was pretty slow. Off night that's for sure."}
{"text":"I'm throwing up 4 stars completely based on the great Happy hours prices ($3.50 tall domestics), beer selection and cool bartenders. I have been here plenty of times but have not eaten anything yet... It's a great location to play some NTN trivia. They usually have people playing and some good competition. Famous Sam's will remain in my neighborhood trivia rotation for quite some time."}
{"text":"My favorite place for hamburger...lunch specials $5.50  includes drink....one special each weekday...service is great..."}
{"text":"Ordered fish and chips and they were THE most CLEANEST and DELICIOUS fish I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"good food, service needs some improvment (two words: professionalism and courtesy) food made the difference for me"}
{"text":"Food- taste horrible Service- 1-10.....it gets a 4 UFC fights- plenty of tv's to watch the fights."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials, good service, average for a sports bar. We happened in on a Friday on a \"Battle of the Bands\" night and enjoyed that. My sons have a band and I made some mental notes to tell them when I got home. It was a young crowd when we went, but it may be different on different nights."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Famous Sam's!!!  It's the neighborhood hang out...  The service is great. They are fast and always willing to change something if you ask. The TVs can be improved, but I constantly pick Sam's for their service over other bars in the area with better TVs. Great place to enjoy food and drinks..."}
{"text":"Famous Sam's is a pretty typical sports bar type place.  I met up with a friend who was in from out of town and visiting his girlfriend.  He suggested the place and I went for it.  The food is ok.  The drinks are ok.  The atmosphere is ok.  But it's all very tame and kind of bland.  There are piles of Famous Sam's in the chain and going to one doesn't feel so much like an event.  There is nothing inherently wrong with them.  I'm sure the people who frequent them are decent.  I myself have been known to be suckered by a good Reuben now and again.  But if I were looking to get faced and make a fool of myself, this wouldn't be the place."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the UFC with my Bf and his friend. The place looks shady from outside, but inside the attention is very friendly. Their sandwiches were really tasty. I had a french dip and it was delicious. My bf had the pastrami (goood). I enjoyed the french fries home made. The drinks were never unattended."}
{"text":"Not an outstanding place. Just a neighborhood joint. I have been coming here for years. They have 3 pool tables and a jukebox and for the most part a full bar. I say this because they are regularly out of the brandy I drink which is not top shelf.   First it's kinda dumpy, the crowd is a mix of people, the area can seem a little ify. It's dark and a little on the small side.   Most of the servers are ding-bats, you kinda expect it in a joint like this. But if you just want to shoot some pool, have a beer and relax this place is A-OK!   I must say I do love their wings and fries very tasty. I will call in orders to go for those. They are yummy. They have a pretty big menu. My friends like the other stuff they have I just always stick to my wings and fries."}
{"text":"Great bar! Great staff! Definitely my favorite place to get drinks with friends and play pool. Awesome happy hour prices and the bartenders are very good. The crispy chicken salad is to die for. They also have an Internet jukebox making it very easy to create your own environment with your own music."}
{"text":"They do live music here, and my band was scheduled to play recently. In the email in which we were booked, we stated that two of the band members are under 21, but they are 20.  Now, we have played at many venues around the Valley, and it has NEVER been a problem. They put big, black \"X\"s on our hands, or wrist bands, whatever, and we ALWAYS follow the rules. Once we arrived, they were in frickin' SHOCK AND AWE that we would even be there because of our age. The owner came out to \"talk\" to us, more like demean us, and told us we can play at 1am, when the liquor license people wouldn't come in. Before he did this, we had offered to stay outside and only go to the stage and out, very politely.  But even after that the owner felt the need to tell us that we obviously don't care about his business, but its WHAT PAYS FOR HIS KIDS SHOES.  Can't imagine how a dump like that even pays for shoes. So we politely declined to stay and do something illegal, and left.  You're right, NOW we don't care."}
