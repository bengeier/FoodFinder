{"text":"Excellent cocktails, great service. Love the vibe at this place. Upgrade of Mabels. Touche'!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour with half priced drinks (including specialty cocktails) and it goes until 7pm. Pretty standard cocktail menu with a few specialty ones. I ordered the mac and cheese last time and it was a much larger portion than I expected and it was really good. They also have Mezcal cocktails which aren't very easy to find in Old Town.  Anyways, the drinks aren't my favorite but I really like the music they play here and that there's lots of room to sit and hang for a while. It gets busy but not as crowded as most of the other Scottsdale bars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on Friday. Drinks where really good. Prices on point. My server Korey was awesome. Talked for a few minutes with Angie. Will def be back"}
{"text":"This place is great. Alexis my bartender recommend high west bourbon.hrest choice. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Loved this place as Mabel's on Main but when it changed they apparently took the service with them. Went in with a friend on a Saturday night for an after dinner drink. Took forever to get a drink from one of the 2 bartenders even though there were only 2 couples at the bar. Once we managed to get that drink it was all over. They totally ignored us for the next 30 minutes. If a customer is willing to pay as much for a drink as the bottle would cost at a store, you would think a little customer service would come along with it. Wish we had had the great experience some of these other reviewers wrote about, but probably won't give a second chance on this one."}
{"text":"Love the couches by the fireplace. Bartender girls make a nice old fashioned."}
{"text":"I love the posh look of this place.  Great food and happy hour options, and a lovely patio.  Plus, it's right on gallery row so you can feel artistic and cultured as soon as you sit down.  On the weekends, really loud live music.  But other nights, it's just chill place to go.  Definitely check out the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Used To be awesome. With the new makeover on the exterior and new patio furniture (which looks awesome) they don't have anyone on staff to come and take your order even if you're waiting more than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible takeout experience. Ordered via Amazon Restaurants and although the delivery was timely, the food was not good at all. The fish and chips (truffle fries) were both very soggy and instead of caper aioli, we got some kind of smoky southwest sauce. The chicken sandwich, according to my husband, tasted like the chicken was previously frozen. The side of Mac and Cheese was disappointing. My husband liked the wings, hence the 2 star v. 1 star rating. Bummer."}
{"text":"Best kept secret.  They actually just remodeled the place!  Very Great Gatsby... and I love their bar!  Fully stocked with top shelf, unique whiskeys.  Super cute vibe and the ambiance is wonderful.  If you want to woo a business client, celebrate a birthday, or enjoy a romantic evening, this place is perfect!  They also sometimes have live music.  *If that is the case, it is a bit noisy.  Check their events for more info."}
{"text":"Can't have enough of this place, they serve all of their sandwiches and burgers on English muffins and have several cocktails to choose from, awesome service and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"First time here...just looking for a very quick bite to eat before we had an appointment/game to play  across the street.  Pleasantly surprised! From the very friendly bouncer outside to the live music and dark/cozy atmosphere to the food and drink. We sat at the bar and ordered 4 appetizers and drinks. We were in and out in 30 minutes but will be back for sure!! We were extremely impressed by the Margherita flat bread and Mac and cheese.  If you are in the area stop in. Cozy sofas to sit and visit. Tables and bar seating. Check out the women's restroom floor also!! Be sure to order two flat bread orders if there is more than one of you eating. Not sure what makes it so different but it's yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great location - staff was superb, good selection of wine, excellent atmosphere. A relatively quiet place compared to the venues just east on North Scottsdale, good for conversation."}
{"text":"Really great food and atmosphere! The cocktails are right on target! Fun and comfortable place to hang out with friends. Great service and friendly staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich and unfortunately the chicken was clearly frozen.  Very tough and chewy.  The mac n cheese had no flavor.  The fries were soggy.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Great happy hour with good food and drinks.  Only problem was they got a little busy and when food was delivered we waited 20 min before we received silverware and napkins and then another 20 after we received our bill to pay. .. will give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Was very eager to try this place. Great atmosphere, but staff seemed more eager to talk to each other and joke around than take care of people. It wasn't very busy, but find something to do or send a couple of people home.   Cocktails sounded impressive on the menu but were a real disappointment- way too sweet and out of balance. Just not very sophisticated or what I'd expect from a real craft cocktail bar...this place is more like a poser craft cocktail bar."}
{"text":"Friday night date dinner on the way to our friends birthday party within a mile of this new spot- The Beverly.  We stopped in around 8:30pm and parked right out front, the dark awnings with thin writing made this bar slightly difficult to find.  We realized it was a seat yourself kind of place- which we did.  They had a range of high top tables, booths, and bar seating.  I opted for a pi√±a colada which was delicious and strong!!  We ordered a Brussels sprout salad & margherita flatbread.  Both food options exceeded our expectations!   This is more of a bar with food- not as much of a restaurant which is fine with me.  They had a dj playing a mix of top 40 & classic party starters- would have liked a more hip music mix to match the ambience & elevated drink menu.  This is not Applebee's!  Overall would return with a group of people or another date night drink spot!"}
{"text":"Great drinks from a menu featuring classics such as sidecars and whiskey sours and new creations - one that I can't remember the name of - featured peaches in it. Nice neighborhood vibe in this place and on the night we visited - great live music. It can get loud. The place features great leather booths. Perfect for a romantic nightcap."}
{"text":"Hokay, Been to this place twice now.  Went last Friday to hear this little jazz band, which was pretty good.   Sadly that was the best part.   Let's start with the food.  Let's have some fish.  Pretty sure it isn't supposed to ooze grease, or taste well, bad.   And oh yeah, a reminder of the crappy tilapia for some time the next morning.  Fun times.    Ok, so I didn't go there to have a gourmet meal.  Bad fish aside, let's have a drink!   Since the waitress didn't know or couldn't tell me what tequila they had, I went to the bar.  Asking questions including how much, I settled on a Don Julio Anejo for 15.00    Kinda pricey for a mid level sipping tequila, but hey, it IS Old Town.  Can I have it on the rocks?  Sure!.  Decided to have a change of scenery and our bill came.    It isn't the money, I mean 3.00 isn't much.  But really?   3.00 for \"rocks\"??   A fifteen dollar small pour of anything should come with free ice.  It was on the side, maybe five cubes in a small glass.   For three bucks, could you just add it to my drink for me?      Sorry The Beverly, there won't be a third time to charm me, twice was enough.  There are WAY too many places in Old Town that are much better, or much more economical.  You didn't make either list."}
{"text":"I wanted my birthday party to have a 20s theme, so I chose this place for its speakeasy vibe. My husband called a few days before for a reservation and was told they don't take Saturday reservations because it is busy. He asked what time it typically gets busy and the GM couldn't specify.  Our group of 10 arrived at 8:30pm. The place was empty. We seated ourselves and began ordering drinks and apps. Every order took 20+ minutes to arrive. The ambiance is great, but the service is lacking. Our waitress was friendly and nice, but it doesn't take 20 minutes to make a martini. The menu is small and mostly heavy appetizers, but the food is great. We enjoyed our truffle fries and filet bites.  We plan on returning, but hope that service will improve."}
{"text":"The fiancee and I came in for drinks late on a Friday night.  There was a live band playing which was nice, we are not fans of DJs anywhere other than a dance club.  We picked a corner booth, and perused their drink menu.  We decided, and sat not sure if there were servers or if we order at the bar.  It turns out there were servers, but not very efficient ones, so I ended up ordering at the bar.    My fiancee had a glass of the cab which she liked.  I got a dirty gin martini and the Heart of the Sun drink.  The martini was interesting, they put something that tasted of oranges in it, which didn't really seem to go with the olive brine, but it wasn't bad.  The next drink I was excited about because I love green chiles.  It ended up tasting OK, but the mango made it way too sweet for me.    All in all, it was a fun place.  The ambiance is outstanding, the service is subpar, and the drinks, while atypical, have potential.  We will have to experiment more on our next visit."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst dining experience I have ever had. I ordered a wedge salad. The salad had all the makings of a wedge salad, but was not. With loads of dressing saturating the whole plate with lettuce in small pieces it was disguising.  The menu is so small you really did not have any healthy choices.  I asked if I could add a protein to the salad and was told they only have fried chicken, ok forget that.  We ended up just leaving and going to another restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Decent drinks, friendly albeit somewhat absent service, and insanely loud music are all you really need to know.  Drink prices are on the upper end for Scottsdale, but are \"artisanal\" and \"hand-crafted\" so it's worth it, amirite??  PS I miss the goat head from the Mabel's days.  PPS Would be a good place to bring an ugly, doesn't match his/her pictures online date because it's realllllly dark."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.  What an awesome find!!   So glad there is a bar in old town you can go to and enjoy an amazing drink in an gorgeous atmosphere without any regular Scottsdale douchebags!!!      I had the filet bites and they were awesome.  My girlfriend had the pear salad and I regret not getting that for myself.  Also it was really cool that they had so many gluten free and vegan options.  For the cocktails I had the Smokeshow and my girlfriend had the Child's Pose, I recommend both..  RIP to the rest of the bars in old town.  The Beverly is the place to be now!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great ambiance, great happy hour, great food and drinks. Docked a star because they changed their menu and the choose your sour is no longer on happy hour but I guess I will live. Bar tenders are very nice for the most part, girl with black hair could be a bit nicer but then again I look like I'm 16 so I am usually treated as such. Anyway, try the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR in town!!  This is my 5th Friday in a row here.  Every time I walk in the door I am greeted with a gorgeous staff and they treat me like I am royalty.  I think I have had everything on the food menu but if I had to pick a favorite then I would say the tuna sliders are godly!!!  I don't think anybody in town makes a better Lemon Drop Martini and it's half off for happy hour too!!    I heard that they recently came under new ownership and I must say that the new owners are doing an awesome job.  I'll see you next Friday Beverly!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour on a weeknight! Love the location west of Scottsdale Road sort of in a quieter section of Old Town (I like to avoid the hustle and bustle if possible) decor 5 Stars! Chic dark warm speakeasy feel, comfortable booths and good happy hour menu. Service was good our server let us alter the cocktails to our liking (within reason of course) the \"the little devils\" AKA deviled eggs were so good! They aren't the overpowering overstuffed ones like you get at a cheesy company picnic. They were petite with the perfect amount of filling topped with crisp bacon crumbles and of course paprika. Royale with bleu cheese (sliders) my two relatives dining with me ordered their burgers medium well (UGH my own flesh and blood travesty!) I ordered mine medium. Okay so they all came medium well, okay not the end of the world. The patty was sooo thin it reminded me of a grocery store White Castle patty. The buns were so big it overpowered the meat, aioli and bleu cheese. The buns also fell apart in your hands I didn't see them as fresh. Truffle fries were very good and came out piping hot so I knew they weren't sitting around all afternoon. Truffle flavor was light but they were good cuts of potato almost tasted homemade as if they cut the slices. Slightly greasy but they are fries. Drink of the month I had to try it \"Pirate Hooker\" not a huge fan but it happens with specialty drinks. I will try this place again and order other things I loved everything about it except the food."}
{"text":"This is the same Mable's on Main, but revamped and renamed. Basically the same and as always it looks great. They still serve very nice and overpriced drinks, that comes to you from the bar my nice waitresses. And speaking of the personnel, I am a fan of the sexy while not trashy look of the female bartenders. Very nice and sets the standard on this place.   I had some gingerly, elderberry concoction that was super nice, served in a low-ball glass with two golf ball size ice cubes. Which mean, that the delicious elixir was very small. Again, severely overpriced but since you are not charged separately for the ambiance - I think this could very well be worth it. Artisanal ist mir egal - but the place looks great, and all I saw was friendly faces.   I used this place as the starting point for a night out in Scottsdale. It served its purpose very well."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING happy hour hang out with friends at Beverly on Main yesterday! We were there late afternoon & the vibe was very chill, the food was excellent & service was outstanding. Much love to Adrian and Angie for making our visit so terrific. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Very chill place. Went on a Wednesday night so not too busy. Good drink selection. The French dip sliders are very good. The Truffle fries had a nice crunchy taste and my friend order the Charcuterie so we felt super bourgeoisie."}
{"text":"Tender Bites are amazing. Brussels Sprouts divine!  Grapefruit Martini with infused Basil made by Megan incredible!!!  What more can one ask for....for an amazing evening?  Chef Jorge!!! Where are you?  Your legacy follows!!!"}
{"text":"Great lowlit upscale bar.  The drinks were delicious, the music was good.  Drinks can be a little over priced."}
{"text":"Came here right around thanksgiving and really enjoyed ourseleves. The atmosphere inside is so cool and the drinks were really good! The bartenders were friendly and nice as well.  The place had wonderful Christmas decorations up too! Great job!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, prompt service and amazing sliders and deviled eggs!!! Just let the bartender know what you like and you're sure to get an amazing cocktail. I mentioned I liked tart drinks and preferred vodka, next thing I knew there was a magical drink of goodness sitting in front of me!!"}
{"text":"I've only been in for Happy Hour/Dinner, so I'll save a 5-star review for when I return later at night.  This place is very similar to \"Mabel's On Main,\" but with a smaller food menu.  Some tasty appetizers (the flatbreads are delicious), some great burgers, but not too much else.  You really want to go here for the awesome food/drink specials (Happy Hour goes until 7 and includes $2-$3 beers, as well as half-off cocktails.  YUM.  The place was pretty deserted when we came in, so hey, come check this place out! You kind of have to search it out, but it's worth the effort.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"The BEVERLY is well known in Scottsdale for its amazing cocktails so I had to finally try it. Our first cocktail was the Childs Pose and had fresh squeezed lemon. I couldn't believe the difference it to made! The ambiance  is perfect for a quiet happy hour with leather booths lining the entire bar and dark lighting to infuse romance and seduction. I absolutely love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a couple of beer and some appies. The wings were great, and they had my favourite beer on tap! Live music was a treat. A great couple of hours. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Let me say this first... I have had quite a few good experiences at the Beverly, and before tonight, I would have certainly recommended it! However, as a person who has worked in the service industry for years, service is something that is instrumental in whether I enjoy or do not enjoy my experience at a particular location. Tonight, I sat at the.bar with my bf was served by a woman in a loose grey tank and long hair (didn't catch her name) that came across as icy and unfriendly. Whereas previously I have received drinks that are fun to watch made and have garnishes on them, tonight, I thought we were under poured and my drink was served in a plastic glass. When I asked said bartender about the plastic glasses, casually and not meaning to put her on edge, she responded very defensively and said \"yeah well that's what happens after so many people break glasses \" Brisk attitude, no eye contact. Might I say, that I myself have never broken a glass, and so I don't feel like I need to be spoken to in that way. I don't think I came across as attacking her or the fact that they were transitioning to plastic glasses, but I was just inquiring, because in such a nice place, it seems a little odd to use plastic. There were no garnishes on our drinks, and they also appeared under poured. This, on top of the fact that our bartender seemed burdened by our presence, led to an overall rather unpleasant experience. I understand what it is like to have a bad day and have it reflect in your service, so I will not go as far as to say that this place is bad or that I will never return! However, I do think that attitude is something that needs to be addressed and it did, tonight, lead to a rather unpleasant experience for us."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a couple drinks and an appetizer with a friend. We got there pretty early in the evening so the place was pretty empty. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a couple drinks, which were delicious! We also split an order of the mac'n'cheese with added chicken, it was fantastic.  I can't wait to come back here on my next trip."}
{"text":"Great new bar in the art district of Old Scottsdale. Great bunch of people running a friendly business. Music almost nightly and lots of specials."}
{"text":"Attended a free Jack Daniels event, but they served a bunch of good food from the kitchen. I could not tell much difference from the last place that was here - they seemed to have taken all the TV sets down as they have one TV set and on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't even turned on. The patio outside and bar inside are unchanged. All my drinks were free, but the bartender did mix a nice Jack and Coke. The buffet had a wide array of foods and most were top notch including the sliders (beef burger and beef). The pizza was thin crust and cold, but the mac and cheese was a good version with bread crumbs and all the salads and cheese plates were fresh as well. Seems like a nice place still to grab a drink and appetizer."}
{"text":"Fun bar with great staff. There are a few hidden secrets that make for an entertaining evening."}
{"text":"Beverly on Main... CLASSY AF! I love this bar! There speciality drink menu is by far the best in old town. After exploring all art studios, you're able to enjoy a beverage outside under the misters or at the amazing seating the Beverly offers. The staff is extremely welcoming & the freshly muddled drinks are fabulous. Some nights they offer live music but it's also a great place to catch a game  too. The food is far more than what you'd expect from bar food. Their margarita pizza is to die for! We also tried the steak bites... they were marinated perfectly and were cooked very well! I've never had steak bites anywhere else but I'll definitely be returning for them. The Beverly also has a \" Secret Room \" great for small gatherings that want some privacy. The ladies restroom is well lit and perfect for selfies !! This is the perfect place for a little local date night with your significant other!"}
{"text":"This place had a great atmosphere for a date night or just happy hour with a group of friends, and the drinks were fantastic. Unfortunately the food was awful. We had a flat bread and fries and it was difficult to eat. Our friends ordered sliders and enjoyed them but I wouldn't suggest bringing your appetite to this place."}
{"text":"I debated on giving 3 stars, but their great service bumps it up to a 4. We  swung by Beverly on a Monday evening for happy hour and it was pretty empty. We were quickly seated at the bar - they also have several lounge seating around the room. The overall vibe I got was trendy, with neon signs and top 40 club music playing in the background. I ordered a negroni ($4 off for happy hour), which was pretty standard. My partner ordered some of their specialty cocktails, which I personally thought were just okay. We also ordered the flatbread ($7) and the truffle fries ($4). The flatbread had just a tiny bit of heat to it and came out piping hot; the truffle fries were thick-cut and didn't have that strong of a truffle flavor to it, but were still enjoyable with the aioli they came with. I imagine it'd be entirely different to come here when it's crowded and full of people, but it was a pretty relaxed and casual experience."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by a good friend and we were more than overjoyed with our overall experience. The bartenders (one of which was the GM) were very kind to us and willing to engage in conversation. Beyond their inviting personalities they are very knowledgable about cocktails and made my wifey and I both really great drinks, 2 we ordered by name and 1 was the bartenders choice. If you're looking for a place in Old Town that can handcraft a traditional or modern cocktail, The Beverly IS your place."}
{"text":"AWFUL!  Nice atmosphere although very dark.  Had a nice band playing Thursday night and that was the best part of this place. We came here because we had a gift certificate, more on that later; We walked in and there is no one to greet you, we walked around the restaurant to seek someone out and we were told to just find a place to sit, well the table we chose was filthy, so we sat and waited for the server to come. When the server came over we showed her the table to which she said oh Ill get a rag to clean that up and asked for our drink order, the drinks were priced around $12 so I can see why happy hour would be more popular.  The food menu is so small that I can't imagine anything filling you up here.  Apparently this place is just for drinks and small bites NOT A MEAL.  We ordered the brussel sprout appetizer, the fish and chips and a wedge salad, but we wanted a protein on it so we asked for chicken.  What we got was fish that was so covered in batter I had to take it apart to see if there was any fish inside and how can you mess up fries?  The truffle fries were awful, the wedge salad came out and was drenched in dressing and not even a wedge, the chicken we asked for were 2 small fried pieces of chicken.  We also did not have utensils to eat with so the server comes over to say she forgot to put the brussel sprouts order in and that she will buy them for us and bring them out soon, she asks how everything is and we say well we dont have anything to eat with, she says Ill bring utensils over, she turns away and instead of immediately going to get us utensils she goes to the table next to us then proceeds to have a lengthy  conversation with them and even sits down! We got the timer on our phone out to time how long it took to get eating utensils, and it was 5 minutes! My dining partner tries the salad and it really was bad, by this time we have had it, she comes over we tell her this food is awful, we have this certificate and we just want to know what we owe you because we are leaving, she says dont worry about it, keep the certificate and come back another time to which we said, heres the certificate keep it, we will never be back.  We ended up at the Cafe Forte next door which was wonderful."}
{"text":"Awesome bourbon/whiskey/scotch selection! Small bites are good, too. Minus a star for price, though I definitely don't expect it to be cheap considering the quality of liquor. Just slighty more of an upcharge than I would prefer"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what attracted my group to the place. The music and setting was wonderful. Drinks were very good and priced as expected. The food is the downfall. The charcuterie board is pathetic. Old grapes, Ritz crackers, and what looked like a slim jim cut in slices. Next was the ahi sliders. Just two thin slices per slider. There is more ginger than ahi tuna. Very poorly done. The pear salad was okay but basic. Service was great but we were the only people to serve. This place has AMAZING potential if they commit to the food they sell. Willing to try again if they renovate their food. A good place for drinks at least."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Such a fun environment and everyone who works here is super sweet. Music and drinks couldn't be better. Looking forward to making this my new normal spot."}
{"text":"On a fun note, the door reads \" classy af,\" the rest? Not great. Cocktails have good presentation and that's it. The tiki me elmo tasted like cherry cough syrup. The xtra dirty martini tastes more like vermouth than anything else.  Servers were inattentive and all congregated at the bar. To top it all off, overpriced af."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. Once around 11pm with girlfriends for a birthday. It wasn't busy but took 30 minutes to have a server come to us, and even longer to get drinks and food. The second time we visited was before First Friday and it was dead. Our server was hard to find, and less than useful for re-ordering and getting more drinks. We probably would have ordered more but we constantly had to ask our busser to put in orders for us. We bragged about the food to our friends and were sorely disappointed in the service, especially when it was dead on a Friday night at 6:30. No thanks!"}
{"text":"After hearing a \"never again\" review, from a family member, a friend and I decided to check it out, for ourselves.  While the cocktails were okay - nothing more than that - the service  (which started out amicably) simply disappeared - and we were seated AT THE BAR.  We had been poised to order food but, by the time another bartender got around to us, all we wanted was the check and to leave, ASAP.  If they had been super busy, it might have been forgivable but there was one table, on the patio, one table inside and two other people at the bar.  Seriously. At one point, the bartender had gone around and was wiping down the bar, on the other side, while we sat there, with empty glasses.  Now that's bad."}
{"text":"I was anticipating a 5 star experience, and left with a 3 based on the rude service and sllloooww response time. There was one other party at 3:30 on a Friday, happy hour, so we werent sure why it took so long. The food was good but not great. The decor was very nice, as was the cleanliness of the restroom, so I was dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails right by my house. Can't beat it! I recommend the filet bites and Brussels sprouts. It wasn't super filling but after a few cocktails it was just right. Weekend nights are busy but not too busy like the rest of old town."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan for a few years now. My latest experience was last month for a friend's birthday. We had a large group and they were super friendly to accommodate, the food was delicious and the drinks were spot on. If you want a good drink, ask for Tau at the bar. I've known him for years, he's the man. They also have great music and ambiance, so it's a perfect place to go after work to unwind after long day or a long week."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a drink. Very nice ambiance and the bartender was good and attentive. I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is our go-to after dinner drink spot! It is super classy, there is usually live music on the weekends, and all in all, it is just a great place to sit back, relax and sip on great classic cocktails while mingling with your significant other or friends. To the guys: If you want to impress a date, bring her here after dinner! Their cocktails have unique ingredients that you can't just get anywhere. My favorite is the French which has gin, fresh lemon, and champagne. Specialty cocktails are $12 but they're worth it, especially when there is live music. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. And that was about it. The cheese board was abominable - processed cheese slices, a mound of crumbled blue cheese, standard packaged crackers - I was embarrassed. Drinks were fair. Pizza was fair. Mac and Cheese ok, salad was soaked in blue cheese dressing. So overpriced and so Scottsdale Bar Food. Four of us with four liquor drinks and food was $150. WAY not worth it."}
{"text":"First visit this evening and I must say Dustin can make a cocktail! First off, if u go on a Tuesday it's 30% off mescal (my fave spirit) as well as tequila.  All I can say is the talent behind the new Mabel's is a keeper! All around a comforting environment & in loved sitting at the bar. I have a sweet spot for a bartender to give recommendations based on my palate & this is what you will receive here.  Happy Hour is 4-7 with half-priced specialty cocktails. Please make it your next cocktail destination & see Dustin on Tue, Thu and Saturday. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Went into Beverly last night and I had the best time I think I have ever had with family and friends.  So impressed with the whole mood in there.  The staff was top notch and the drinks were better than anywhere I have ever been.  The cheeseboard was bomb.  So yeah 5 stars, no place is better than this place, end of story."}
{"text":"I give it two stars because there was a SUPER long wait for everything. I'm q bartender so I get the whole waiting on everything and how long each item takes, however, I definitely didn't appreciate having to wait 45 minutes for our checks. Not including how long the food wait was. Ryan was our server and he did his best but He definitely needed help. I'm pretty sure he was the only server and definitely need help, especially when the owner is too busy talking to Cougars instead of helping his staff. Oh and the owner told us rudely we needed to move so they could have a dance floor. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor - classy, cozy and very comfortable on a cool AZ evening!  They have a great happy hour - $5 wedge salad & 1/2 price cocktails.  I enjoyed the French 7018 and it was fantastic - gin, apricot and prosecco...how can you go wrong with that combination?    We will definitely be back for more tasty cocktails and eats!"}
{"text":"Final stop of the birthday night, and The Beverly did not disappoint.  It had been on my list of bars to try in Old Town for awhile.  Walked in and greeted instantly with the low lighting.  I forget what was playing in the background but it was definitely something light which was nice.    The girls ordered some sissy drinks obviously and I just stuck to the brown liquor...naw, I did stick to brown liquor type cocktails with a \"That's My Jam.\"  The two ladies Child's Pose and Classy AF.    Our waitress was there when needed and asked the right questions at the right times.  The lounge decor and booths was exactly what I desired out of a cocktail bar, drinks were great, not as good as Counter-Intuitive but this could be in crawl all the time.  You find yourself in the bathroom walking on a floor of pennies...the only thing missing was a trough, I implore you to bring the trough.  There was a DJ board set up so I wonder when the music will be spun.  Great end to an awesome night."}
{"text":"We were looking for a happy hour place after an afternoon of riding in the mountains. The Beverly has hh till 7 PM so we went there. And we're so glad we did! Excellent food portions even for hh and amazing crafted cocktails that hit the spot!  The service was a bit overbearing - while we were still eating and drinking a couple of servers alternately stopped by literally every 5 min to ask if we needed anything. Not sure if they were trying to get us to leave but it felt that way."}
{"text":"We found this place very randomly. BUT...oh my gosh!  Best find in Old Scottsdale. Our bartender, Andrew, made the best cocktails EVER! I thought I wanted a \"Froze Rose\". The BEST DRINK on the menu is \"Aperol We've Been Through\". (Right side) Literally...AMAZING! Talk to Andrew, he will hook you up with the best, most flavorful drinks!  Menu looks great, we didn't eat just had drinks. But seriously amaze!!!!!!  A must try!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here frequently over the past 9 months and honestly I don't like going anywhere else as much as I like going to the Beverly. Good music, good drinks, and staff is friendly.  The food happens to be pretty awesome as well!  The filet bites don't disappoint. I'm definitely ready for the re-launch and to see the Beverly at its highest potential!"}
{"text":"In the mood for a great spot in Scottsdale where an adult can relax with a cocktail and really good food? And friendly, responsive and helpful servers? Look no more! Beverly on Main is the place for you! Our group enjoyed craft cocktails and an impressive list of small bites. You won't go wrong with the steak tips, boneless chicken wings, charcuterie  board or deviled eggs.   Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was here for drinks, not food... so I'm rating this place at first blush... that said, I'm looking forward to the opportunity to come back ASAP!  I know I've passed this place a handful of times, each one thinking \"Wow, what is that place? It's hopping in there!!! I've gotta get back here and check it out!\" Well, going out for a friend's birthday, I finally had a chance to pop in and see what it was about!  We started here for drinks, and I've gotta say, the ambiance is so cool and comfortable. The seating options range from cozy chairs to big lush booths that encourage an intimate feel, perfect for kicking off an evening or catching up with friends! I ordered the \"Secret Garden\", which was so good, I went back for another. The service was reasonable, though a little slow to check for refills. I'm told that they have a great happy hour, so I'll definitely make my way back over to see how that is. What a cool discovery, and just a few blocks from home! Perfect!"}
{"text":"The best speakeasy around! Heart of the Sun martini was the best w green chile vodka and mango pur√©e! Food was amazing! Thanks Tucker and Jorge!!"}
{"text":"So I have goggles on my forehead and a towel on my suit!!   But seriously I just love this place. Had to write a review about how much I just love it!!!   The Beverly is so frigen great...  Hands down best spot in Scottsdale.   Beverly don't forget me when you are so busy that you can't even make room for another hot server!!"}
{"text":"Best drinks in Old Town! The margaritas are my favorite , the food is amazing and the staff is one of a kind ! Highly recommend Beverly , and I NEVER leave yelp reviews. Can't wait to go back. (:"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went with a few friends after work. I had 2 modern cocktails, Don Quiotex (sp?) and Jameson and the Giant Peach. The bartender, Chris, and the waiter was very nice. We got to me the chef, Jorge. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night and I am glad I stopped by here. I normally don't order fancy cocktails but I had an old fashioned. Tau was the bartender and the drink was pretty delicious!  The bar is a chill spot to hang out. It wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night but it is a good spot to hang out and relax with friends for drinks. I thought the coasters were pretty cool too! I would definitely stop by for drinks with friends if I am back in the area."}
{"text":"This place makes me moister than an oyster first of all. I heard the bartenders are all models, the management is trained in Switzerland and the chefs are trained in France. It truly is \"Classy AF\" with their newly remodeled interior and exterior. Joel is a wizard with his punny marketing tactics and Andrew is a chemist when it comes to mixing drinks. Where do they even find these people?!? You can spend $11 dollars on a well drink in the entertainment district or spend that on a Carefully Constructed Cocktail (CCC) here! They also use PREMIUM toilet paper in the bathrooms. Hellz yeah fam! This place is the place to be, every day. Leave your wife and come here instead. Do it now. I mean it leave your family and job and come eat truffle fries."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends. It made me feel like I was back home in NY for quick minute with the crowd, music and the style of the place. Everything was really good. And the price is a little bit over what I expected but it's worth it. You definitely have to try the macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"My review for The Beverly is long overdue, as I've been coming here for a while now since the ownership/name change from the old Mabel's on Main.   First things first, this place is great for happy hour cocktails and food or an evening/late night round of drinks and shareable options, but it's not necessarily a dinner spot in my opinion. They have some really good small plates or appetizers across the menu which you can fill up on (you have to try the filet bites and sliders), but a limited amount of entree style offerings.  The handcrafted cocktails are second to none in town and on a seasonal rotation. If you're looking for a nice cozy lounge to sip on some quality libations away from the craziness in Old Town Scottsdale, this is the place to go. They do everything from bringing in live music with a DJ or band, cocktail dinners featuring specific distributors, to private parties in their back room (hidden behind the bookshelf and two-way mirror).  The ambiance is great with the low lighting, worn brick walls, and strange classic movies playing on the TV. Chris Hardin and his staff do a fantastic job with their above and beyond service as well. I recently put together a small party for my brother using the private room in the back and everything went off without a hitch.  The Beverly is definitely worth checking out if you're in the Old Town area and looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super cute and the food is delish (especially the Brussel Spouts and the Deviled Eggs). The drinks are also super tasty. The service is a little eh, but everything else makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Great atmosphere!  Fabulous drinks!  What more do you need to know to go and enjoy this place!!"}
{"text":"The Beverly is a welcome change of pace from the loud bars and clubs of Old Town. It has more of a lounge atmosphere where you can actually engage in conversation and not have to shove your way through huge crowds. We stopped in right after work for some snacks and a few drinks and were not disappointed with the Moscow Mules (easy to make, tough to master) nor the flatbreads."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I tried this place for the very first time with my boyfriend. We caught happy hour, which was a bonus! They have a large selection of cocktails, and everyone was very friendly. The menu is pretty simple, which makes it easy to order and the food is amazing. We tried the mac n cheese (strongly recommended) and a few other things. It was all wonderful! Great food and atmosphere. A must  try!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for a week.  First visit to The Beverly was pleasant, sitting at the bar.  Ahi sliders were good.  Second visit we sat at a booth.  Had two drinks and food which were fine.  While getting out of booth I fell down onto the floor  on my hands and knees because there was an extra step down to the floor which wasn't visible because the lights were dimmed very low (6:45PM).  Bad design or lights dimmed too extremely in short time, I don't know, but no one even acknowledged that I had fallen."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for thanksgiving and wanted to grab a drink one night. We took to yelp and this was one of the suggestions. I will say that this is not someplace that I would have chosen on my own. However that being said, we had an enjoyable time there. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess who mentioned that the couches/lounge area was reserved. No problem, we like to sit at the bar. We sat down and were promptly greeted by the bartender Angela (I'm pretty sure that was her name). She was really friendly and I asked her about the white girl rose and she offered to pour me a taste (which we both agreed is not good). So I opted for a French 75. My husband had a gin and tonic. We stayed for 2 drinks. The bar filled in. It definitely seems like there is a mix of local regulars along with out of towners. It's a pretty big space. The cocktails are standard but good. It's not what I would consider a craft cocktail bar-nothing overly inventive, but hey, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, right? Sometimes it's nice to go to a place that just sticks to the basics and does them well. This is that kind of place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a Friday to the surprise of Happy hour till 8! We enjoyed amazing food and craft cocktails with great service from Tami! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped here before taking a large group to Escape the Room. During happy hour this place can't be beat. Great drinks, great food, great ambiance. Make sure to order the vodka infusion or punch, packs a serious punch with a taste that is on point. I will be referring all of my friends to this place for the best happy hour in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not your old BEVERLY. If you enjoy the tacky ultra lounge feel you will be right at home.  The remodel in my opinion is horrible.    What used to be a very classy place with great food and drinks is now in a major identity crisis. After coming here at least 10 times over the last year and ordering the same old fashion with bourbon instead of rye, I was greeted with a \"you can't do that\" from the waitress.  After I told her to go ask someone she came back and told me that switching to bourbon would be a five dollar up charge.  Wife ordered her regular Moscow mule. It arrived made from fruit juice concentrate.... hm. Ok. Have fun with the new look and feel BEVERLY.  I'm sure it was just a coincidence the place was empty on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is one of my favorites. It's a well structured menu and the cocktail list is amazing. Not too many places do that for HH.   The interior is dark and mahogany with bits of contemporary splashed around. Like an updated speakeasy. The staff is great to look at, both men and women. They are always attentive to us when we go.   4 bucks off classic cocktail list? that's great! We always get the roasted brussel sprouts, the margharita flatbread, and the macncheese. Everything is always consistently good. Most items come with meat or bacon but we just ask for them to hold the pork and they do!  The brussel sprouts are always lightly caramelized with the burnt crispy edges and the sweet, soft inside...with lots of slivered onions. The mac n cheese is rich and creamy and quite a big portion, and the flatbread is thin, crispy and has a great tangy marinara sauce.   It's never packed for HH....great for us! But around 8 pm, this place was bustling and the DJ was getting set up. We never stay because we're too old and like to be in bed by 9......"}
{"text":"I love the Beverly's drinks and I have brought many people to join in happy hours! The drinks were the best in town and the happy hour is a great deal. Unfortunately, the restaurant changed management recently and did an overhaul on the cocktail menu. Currently sitting in a booth in the restaurant and missing the old cocktails :( I should also mention that the service is typically slow going...."}
{"text":"Dear Yelp:    I never thought it could happen to me but when this gorgeous girl came up to me and asked me to go to the Beverly a few Saturdays ago and I couldn't refuse!  The look in her eyes made it clear that she wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer!!    We got there and I couldn't believe this place!  Half of the Phoenix Suns were there and they were throwing money around like it was nothing and buying rounds of drinks for the whole place and all of these scantily clad women were practically having sex in the booths and then Sam Smith walked in and the place really went nuts and I'm making this all up!  My favorite drink is the Namaste Beaches."}
{"text":"SpeakEasy + Exotic drinks  = Top Scottsdale Bar.  I love this place.  The vibe in here is really fun, and not like any other bar in Old Town.  The exposed brick walls, leather booths, and mahogany wood bar create a 1930's feel.  The mixologists have some skills too!  They make some very creative, tasty drinks.  Everyone in our group was really impressed.  I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Swanky cocktail bar with great live music.  Highlights: - Cocktails: some classics like a sazerac plus a few cool ones like a green chile vodka one - Live music: loved the guy with a guitar singing his own cover versions  - Bar: long rectangle with comfy leathery padding to lean on - Atmosphere: bit dark and cool with a good mix of people away from the more lively bar areas  Lowlights: - Music stopped a bit early so we only got to hear a bit. Energy wasn't as electric when the musician left.  Loved this spot and would come back."}
{"text":"Tuesday night we popped in here for a bottle of wine and a snack. We sat at the bar and service was good.  The atmosphere is romantically dark. I love it.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have now been to The Beverly three times, twice with friends and on a date and once with my gal pals when we celebrated my birthday bash.   The servers are always quite friendly and efficient.   The HH cocktails are great.   I ordered the drink that has the word \"aspirin\" in it.  I can't remember the exact name.   It was soooo good that three of my four gal pals ordered it as well.  We had the mac and cheese, the wings, deviled eggs, margarita flatbread, truffle fries.   I like the wings, mac and cheese and the fries.   I didn't care for the eggs.   Too much pickle.   I don't especially care for bread, therefore didn't really like the flatbread.     The furniture is rather dark and heavy.   One can sit on the patio in the front as well and watch and listen to the traffic.   I like the atmosphere albeit it could probably seem \"hot\" in the summer because of the darkness of the decor.    A musician was setting up when we left.   Next time, I shall have to stay for the music."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my family, very impressed. I like that it gets business but it's not too loud and packed like most bars. It has a very laid back feel as well. They even had a live jazz band playing there around 7 P.M. The food was amazing! I ate off of the happy hour menu and the truffle frys were great. The mac and cheese was a very good size for the price. Both of these were only 4 dollars! I also recommend my waitress that I had to anyone who goes in there next time. Her name was Nina and she was hands down the best waitress I've had in a VERY long time. She works hard and is very interactive with anyone who comes in. I give this a 5 star rating, take advantage of the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Tonight was amazing! I had the best service by I think his name was Corey? My drinks were always full and never dry. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great drinks, but on the food...lay off the #@#$ing truffle oil."}
{"text":"This place is my cheers bar! It actually looks like cheers from the TV show .  Staff is always warm and welcoming.  Wide variety of speciality cocktails that covers all the taste buds.  If you are hungry order up some steak bites!  They have never let me down once"}
{"text":"Mediocre...charcuterie board was okay. I could have made something at least as good with a quick trip to frys. It was a hodgepodge of average quality meats and cheeses that didn't flow well together. The server was uneducated regarding drinks and wine. Asked if she preferred one bottle over another and she literally reached over my shoulder to look at the list and picked the most expensive red when I was asking about whites. Then she disappeared for the rest of the night. The person that actually brought our wine out was friendly, knowledgeable and had a much better attitude. She was the highlight of the night. Overall underwhelmed. Would come back for happy hour but not high on my list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited here for the second time- we take weekend trips from Vegas. Really amazing cocktails. I've had the Hemingway Daiquiri and Amaretto Sour Stone. He's a whiskey man and absolutely loved the Sazerac- he said it's exactly how a whiskey cocktail should be. Ambiance is great; service was on point. The only thing I'd recommend for improvement is to turn down the live music amp by a notch or two- they had a band with artists playing the cello, drums, and trumpet- the trumpet could be a bit ear piercing at times, though they are great musicians! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I could not believe how vile this place was.  1.  Dirty.  The glasses were dirty, the silverware was dirty, the server was dirty, the floor was dirty.  They really need to hire someone who knows how to read.  2. Rude staff.   Ick.  Such nasty people.     Sorry, I like to go out drinking.  But I will never give these fools a penny of my money again.  Never."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in old town for a craft cocktail or a glass of wine! I was so happy to see it wasn't wall to wall packed with 21 year olds (we were in Old Town after all). We were even able to find a booth to sit in! Good service, good selection. Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Best place for great food and crazy amazing drinks! And the staff is amazing! Great place for date night or a night of drinking in Scottsdale! They have one of the best happy hours in old town too! Definitely try the brussel sprouts and also the Mac n cheese if you're hungry...they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a fantastic staff. The drinks were insanely good and the food was also superb! This is a fantastic happy hour spot and a great place to hang with friends. Stellar execution from top to bottom. This place deserves to have high marks."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed my past experiences at the Beverly, however, last night I experienced the worst customer service from one of the female bartenders. She held my friends card hostage telling her that I did not pay for my drinks and wanted to put them on my friends card. I had already paid! When I got to the bar so my friend could get her card back, the bartender started arguing with me about paying for drinks. I told her multiple times that I already paid, and she continued to argue with me. I told her to check the computer system, I gave her the last four digits on my card, and after she looked she said oh yes it is paid, and just walked away, didn't even apologize for the situation. TERRIBLE customer service equals ruined experience!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey but I love the atmosphere. I was doing the ArtWalk with some girlfriends, we stopped in for a round of cocktails at The Beverly, and they still talk about how much they liked the ambiance. The decor is great, drinks are well-made, good happy hour, and they usually have a live duet playing covers.   The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 stars is because I know it's another loud, scene Scottsdale bar on Friday and Saturday nights. All other nights are great!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place because my girlfriend and I like the look of it and crafty old style cocktails. Walked in about 8:30 there were some people but it wasn't busy. They had loud house music playing which we thought was out of place but hey ifbtha5vworks your thing no problem. We sat at a side of the bar that had no one sitting at it. We were the only ones. There were three people behind the bar, one guy go9ng back and forth and didn't even look our way once. One guy playing with his phone and one guy perpetually polishing a wine glass. We never got even acknowledged. We left. Never going back. It's a real shame a Jazzy type bar with good drinks would have been a nice addition to our regular spots."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars. The atmosphere is great and so are the drinks. I cannot wait to try the food. Especially the happy hour menu. I love the Mad Men vibe and the penny bathroom floors. Very nice place."}
{"text":"BEWARE: I came to this restaurant thinking I would have a good experience little did I know I was in for the worst time ever! We walked in seeing all gold we thought it was a high end nice place and nice people/environment... it was the complete opposite. The waitress came out and told us a few... (hundred) lies. First of all the menu states that anything could be made vegan so I didn't think asking for cheese on the side would be a problem. WRONG. I wanted my sandwich on a bun instead of an English muffin and when our food arrived it was on a piece of toast and she told me \"we usually don't do this\" about putting the cheese on the side and switching buns. WHAT???? If that's the case then the proper thing to do would be to go let the customer know they don't have buns and if that's the case if I wanted to keep my order the same or switch it. My daughter ordered the tacos which comes with chips... 2 chips. I asked the server to have more chips and she told me it comes with only 2 chips.. again WHAT??? The man who ran the food out didn't even know the names of the orders and just started placing them on the table randomly. The server came out to clear off the table and WAITED for us to stack the plates and hand them to her. She just stood there trying to look pretty. She was our waiter but we were definitely WAITING ON HER. Overall, I can seee why we were the only customers there for 2 hours. If I could give 0 star I would... DO BETTER BEVERLY ON MAIN!"}
{"text":"I was here with Bros Clem while they were shooting their music video in the \"secret room\". They were very accommodating and we had an amazing time. The atmosphere is fantastic, it's super dark and kind of gives you an underground feeling. The bartenders were really great!   We also ordered some food. They have these little filet mignon bites that are out of this world. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this classy and sophisticated little secret? Oh! I know! I can tell you that it is so perfect and amazing for a pre-dinner meet up as their happy hour is completely worth the stop.  Has an old Hollywood vibe to its interior but more on the eclectic side.  Pick Your Sour and the Blood and Sand were my favs! Hubby surprisingly went for boulevardier and he loved it!  We enjoyed a few bites and they were also delicious. Braden, our server was a mixologist extraordinaire with a keen sense of flava! He described in detail the fronts and backs of the bourbons and made us some killer classics! Earning the Beverly a 5 star \" this was such a perfect HH\" review!"}
{"text":"Love it! First time was a couple of weeks ago. Super cozy and up scale inside. A good vibe and a good place to get away from the typical old town scene. One down side was the service was kind of slow and Me and my friend felt ignored. We waited about 10 min for a drink at the bar and it wasn't even close to a full house.   Besides the one downside, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very crappy service.... Adam says he doesn't care about customer service.  He's a manager...."}
{"text":"What's the deal with this spot?? Went in at 7ish on a Saturday and the place was empty. My first clue that something wasn't right... Thought okay, maybe this is more of a late night place?? Let's try it out. Trusting Yelp reviews.   NO ONE acknowledged us when we walked in. We wandered around waiting for someone and wondering where to sit. Gave up and decided on the bar. Five minutes later...  a group of girls walks out from behind a curtain in back.   Cocktails were not great. Can't believe they charge some patrons for ice? Should've checked my receipt-- A 12$ Manhattan that took two seconds to make should not be 15$ with ice.  While dining, the servers were on their phones; one in the corner eating ice chips. Watched a couple come in, sit, get ignored, and leave. Watched another group walk in, wander around, and leave. Terrible customer service. I mean really messed up!   Two stars because the interior has a good vibe. But the personalities in there, bad bad vibe.   Still wondering how this place has decent reviews... After reading others reviews, not sure much has changed with the new owners/management. Who is the restaurant industry doesn't know that it's all about customer service???"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place for it's speak-easy look from Yelp but when we got there it was more like a night club. There weren't that many people in there but the music was so loud, my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other. Even when we were sitting on the couches right in from of each other.  The drinks were delicious and the decor was great! Loved the feel of it, but the music didn't exactly match up. We had one drink and left."}
{"text":"Went with friends for the first time and enjoyed Happy Hour.  Lovely cocktails and half-priced appetizers.  The outside seating was very nice.  Friendly service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. You just can't beat a great atmosphere. I actually live in Tucson, but whenever I come up to Scottsdale for work, I have to come here. The drinks are amazing the the staff is even better. I usually do a classic Old Fashion, which is on point, and the Chicken Sandwich. That sandwich alone is almost worth my entire trip. You need to try this place out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I could see this place becoming the next big thing in Oldtown Scottsdale. My friends and I had so much fun dancing here.  Super classy, friendly staff, smells like truffle oil... What more could you want?  Bonus points: the manager (?) blond girl... bent over backwards tracking down my credit card for me. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink. Whiskey menu is a plus. Usually pretty quiet before 8PM or so. Cool old blank and white movies playing on the TV."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Beverly for an after dinner drink and were so pleasantly surprised! It's right on Main St, which is art gallery central and a cool part of the city. What a fun spot to have a cocktail and do some people watching. We did not try the food, but the bartenders were fast and friendly.  The bar is unusual for Scottsdale because it has an older \"city\" feel to it. Brick walls, tin ceiling tiles, chandeliers and vintage lamp shades.  They had live entertainment too, a Santana look alike and another band mate playing mostly 80's tunes, it was great! It was lively without being too loud."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, drinks and atmosphere! This is a Scottsdale Old Town hotspot without the attitude. If you're hungry, you can be assured the food will satisfy while sipping custom cocktail recipes like the watermelon lime mimosa. Don't miss this!"}
{"text":"Was just there yesterday for a wonderful brunch, with friends and family. From the elegance of the venue, to the dynamic on-task of the crew, to the food, to their signature cocktails, to the cool music ambiance; everything about this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was a random yelp find for me. We were discussing where to go and since we recently moved from the Arcadia area, we decided to try more on this side of town. I found the great reviews and had to come.  The bar is really cool - very east coast and classic dark wood etc. We sat and chatted with the couples around us and the bartenders. We had some apps which is such a great value here at happy hour! We were so impressed by the size of the apps and we didn't need to eat dinner. We had the mac and cheese (massive delish portion), wedge salad and wings. Everything was really good and came out pretty fast.  We hung out for a couple of drinks and it didn't kill our wallet. I would definitely come back here as they have more of an adult vibe instead of the bro vibe you usually get in old town. Plus I hear they have a hidden room and just because its hidden I want to eat in it!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in Scottsdale.  Great drinks, all of the ones I tried were delicious - definitely recommend the black tulip (kinda like a Moscow mule!).  Ended up getting some pub food to follow.  Both the fries and the margherita flatbread were amazing (seriously get the flatbread).  I will probably be making this my go to late night spot"}
{"text":"All the reviews that talk about the atmosphere and dimly lit environment  and old school vibe are right on target.  Think \"Mad Men\" meets \"1950's Rat Pack\" meets \"trendy upscale pub\".  It's all true.  The appetizers are what really blew me away.  I went last night for a bachelor party/gathering and while it's true the menu selection isn't very large, what they do have is absolutely amazing.  The sliders, flatbread and wings are almost 'otherworldly'.  Very good.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, the drinks were great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fun environment, good bartenders, and they play good music. I haven't had any food there, but the drink selection is massive!"}
{"text":"The bartender is amazing and knowledgable, he provided us with a flavor profile ... descibing the flavors in every drink. In addition he is able to provide excellent service and still has time to explain everything and socialize. The happy hour food is not bar food, its very upscale and meticulously prepared."}
{"text":"The Beverly has been refreshed! I was a regular here and had hadn't gone in for a few weeks. In those couple of weeks, they really changed the place. It looks amazing. The coasters are amazing, the new menus look and even feel amazing. They even do brunch now! It was slammed! The new best brunch has come to Old Town."}
{"text":"I love this place and recommend it all the time!  We know the owners, but that is not why we go.  The food is actually really good!  I love the steak bites and tried the flat bread for the first time on a date and it was the best I've probably had.  The ambiance is what drags me there. Definitely have to stop and check it out if you are in Old Town."}
{"text":"Really cool place to check out. They hosted a massive event for me and it went flawlessly.  I highly recommend renting out the secret behind the bookcase room if you want to add some fun flair to your next get together. Drinks can be pricy (welcome to scottsdale) but they're so unique that it's absolutely worth it.   The service was incredible.  The management was on the ball before and during the entire event. Coordinated all food and drink and brought it out perfectly timed. They were extremely flexible with the entire evening even though they had another event going on at the same time.   The interior super classy. it definitely has a speakeasy vibe to it.  They open up a dancefloor with a DJ some nights too!  Love this bar."}
{"text":"Love  coming to this place for a cocktail after a dinner out in old Town. Prices are reasonable. Drinks are good. And the place has a really great vibe to it, dark and cozy."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Beverly a few weeks ago and we enjoyed it. The Beverly is under some new management so changes for the better will be occurring over time."}
{"text":"Absolute mule!!  Great atmosphere, food and staff.. Been several times and it quickly becoming a fav spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, original and well-crafted cocktails and concoctions, smart staff. Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Wellll first time here. Probably the last. Been here 45 minutes. Food hasnt arrived. Asked the server about it. he had to ask what we ordered with a look on his face like we never ordered anything.  We ordered the brussel sprouts no almonds due to a huge food allergy. We shall see how that turns out.   Otherwise the atmosphere is nice.  Sigh..."}
{"text":"Service is always entertaining and bartenders are well educated on their spirits. Everything on the menu is great I recommend the tacos, french dip sliders, brussel sprouts and of course the always amazing truffle fries!! They have a great happy hour too! Cheers to the Beverly we love you!"}
{"text":"My kind of place.  Great bar food. Fish and chips and the sliders were awesome.  You have to get the deviled eggs. Love the atmosphere .  You can be in the action at the bar or get a table and have a nice conversation."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Decent happy hour if you jave some out of town guests and looking to show them old town scottsdale! The service was a little slow and mediocre at best.  after 10 minutes of waiting for extra olive juice, I had to go to the bar to get more dirty for my martini. While up there server saw me and asked if i needed something I said yes i was just getting a little more olive juice and she said i am already getting that with a slight off putting tone. So i said ok and went back to table thinking to self if you were getting it i would not have had to get up to get it 10 minutes later!"}
{"text":"Charming place with great bartender and drinks. A bit pricy, but that's Scottsdale for ya."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place.  Definitely my new Sunday spot for now on!!  And let us be fo real, the most badass bar snack I have ever had is by far these complimentary banana chips at the bar.  Little bit of insider info for you - order dessert here!!  Best banana foster I have ever had!!   Also I heard they are about to add chicken and waffles to their brunch menu!!!"}
{"text":"PROS -Delish cocktails -Good vibe, energy and music  CONS -The food took a very long time and was average at best, it was not worth the wait -What happened to these \"model\" bartenders that I read about? There were definitely none, maybe just the hostess?  -No split checks can only accommodate per table (We were a group of 3 different tables)  This place used to be Mabel's but the decor is pretty much the exact same. It's more \"loungy\" as not as rowdy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Cute place. The service was good and the drinks were strong. They had a two man band that played acoustic versions of a variety of songs and they were great, but the place was pretty slow for a Saturday night. There were 8 of us, so when we left the place looked empty. Too bad, but we had to move on.  I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks and a nice ambiance. I was only here for a few minutes before Escape the Room and for a quick drink after but it was nice. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon The Beverly for late night drinks as we were strolling the Art Walk in Downtown Scottsdale. We were drawn in because of the live jazz band and spacious, speakeasy-like interior. I'm told that it is the former Mabel's on Main.  Great craft cocktails, sometimes they do 30% off gins and whiskeys (not sure if it's certain days or hours, but check out the sign on your way to the bathroom) where you can $5-$8 gins and whiskey well drinks.  Love the chill environment with live music, definitely a great place to wine down the night at. Looks like they have a half off drinks happy hour from 3-7pm!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place has serious 5 star potential (in fact, I may be going back next week, so I will update).   The husband and I came here for happy hour and it was ridiculously awesome. I had been here when it was Mabel's, and not much has changed here in the way of decor. Additionally, I think they kept some of the same or similar menu items. Anyway, we sat at the bar and the bartender (Meagan I think...) was awesome. She was just the right amount of friendly and attentive without being invasive. I tried their punch of the day (5$ on HH) which was a ginger beer, hibiscus, vodka, and lemon concoction that was absolutely incredibly delicious. I also tried a drink off their regular menu (6$ on HH) that was pimm's, ginger beer, and some other ingredients, which was good, but not as good as the punch. The drinks were full sized, so it was a pretty smokin deal. The husband got the magic hat beer... so good... it was like a mix between a pale ale and a hef. We also shared the mac and cheese (4$ on HH). This thing was legit delicious. It was a huge bowl for 4$ and was garlicky... almost like an alfredo. I would love to eat this again. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend..  They have a very small menu. I ended up ordering the filet bites. They were definitely very tender and cooked perfectly but not filling at all. My friend ordered the truffle fries which were huge!!! They came with a very tasty dipping sauce. For drinks, their menu didn't really have anything that caught my eye so I ended up getting the Parker station Pinot noir wine. This was very smooth.   This is a pretty small restaurant and their menu selection is very small. After 9 they have a live dj. So it gets extremely loud. I couldn't hear anything my friend said. I Wouldn't come back for dinner. However I'd probably come back for drinks or to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"I use to came here a lot when it was called Mables on Main when Arron May owned it and now Who owns it??? Decent food came here with a friend had the MAC n Cheese with wings.....decent food....The problem is the male bartender who doesn't understand service or is just bored with his job. How hard is it to refill water or ask if we need anything else? Reminds me of the waitresses at RA sushi who just suck at service"}
{"text":"Went here for a celebration with my cousin and friends. It was a pretty. Ice spot in old town. The waiter wasn't the best she took forever to come around . The appetizers were good and the prices weren't too bad either. I wouldn't come back here tho."}
{"text":"Chose The Beverly as it used to Mabel's on Main. The atmosphere inside was nice and they kept the temperature cool.   First waitress (black hair, bangs) didn't seem very interested in helping us, no smiles from her and right off the bat we were told they couldn't make a certain drink because something was broken at the bar.   We ordered happy hour items, the drinks were good and the food  that came out was pretty decent, minus the wedge salad not actually being a wedge.   2nd waiter (guy long hair pulled back) was super friendly, knowledgable and accommodating to our group.   There was however a guy working there that we couldn't figure out if he was friends with someone or actually worked there. He was dressed in all workout gear and was so obnoxiously out of the place.  Not dressing up does not serve the bar well or help keep the theme you're attempting to establish.   As far as a return visit, probably not.   The bathrooms need some work and attending to as well."}
{"text":"This is a super cool place with a speakeasy-type vibe. Good drinks, but can't speak to the food. I definitely want to plan a trip back and spend more time here."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place in Old Town to grab a cocktail and burrow for an evening of chatter with friends. While it may not be my favorite when it's super busy (i.e. post-10pm on a weekend) as drink times typically suffer quite a bit, it's almost always a perfect experience any other time. Food, beverages, atmosphere - the Beverly does them all well and consistently to boot.   We recently held a rather large party here last Saturday evening from about 7-9:30, and we were taken care of much better than I had anticipated for a group of our size. We were able to mix up bar with table service which helped, but our waitress was so on top of everything that it made for a completely seamless night. Outside of an event like this, I usually sit at the bar and their bartenders are always cool. The Ahi sliders and deviled eggs are my favorites, but I recently tried the mac n cheese which was amazing! The Brussel Sprouts weren't anything to write home about, a little greasy for my taste. I have historically loved the amazing cocktail list, but noticed it was pretty pared down on our last visit. That was somewhat disappointing, though our drinks were still very good.  The Beverly will definitely stay on the regular rotation, especially during the summer when tourists disappear and it's a little more manageable to enjoy such a cool *local* spot. But I hope all those amazing cocktails return! Or at least are available by special request :)"}
{"text":"Don't go there for the food. It's not good. The decor is ok if you like generic hipster filled with old people. Ponytail bartender was super nice. The other bartender showed up for work so I guess that's a plus? Def not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service, dirty table, music so loud we can't talk. Not coming back. Sad, because we really enjoyed the Beverly last time we were here."}
{"text":"Such a pretty layout and some really great drinks. The staff is very approachable and friendly. Great place to take a date because of the cozy seating areas."}
