{"text":"Delicious Colombian fast food, portions are great and flavor is authentic!  Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Delicious food! Couldn't ask for anything better!  The food is cooked to perfection, the aroma, flavor and look from home (Colombian) is literally the same! Like if i walked up to a hotdog stand in Colombia and asked for a hotdog! Keep up the amazing work!!"}
{"text":"Ok, FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a vegan and didn't personally eat anything here. I came in a group of 6 people who all ate here other than myself. I know the owner and wanted to support him and his new place! All the people I was with ate and enjoyed the food!  The location is a shared indoor spot that has 6 walk up style food stalls. Like 6 food trucks all inside, sharing seating area. Orlando and his staff at New Granada were friendly and great! My group was unfamiliar with Colombian food as a whole so definitely didn't know what to order. Orlando helped us out with some of his favorites and the teens in the group got burgers. We all got fun Colombian sodas we were unfamiliar with.  We sat down and food didn't take too long. It was delivered with a smile and people got grubbing! Lots of full bellies and smiles around the table!  Great to see a new place open that is different and unique from the millions of places to eat in Las Vegas. I have never seen a Colombian fast/street food before here and it's great to welcome something new!"}

{"text":"Not a bad hot dog, not great but not bad, get a side with a dog because it probably won't fill you up if you can down a Costco dog and still crave more food. I got an empanada and it was tasty but it was smaller than I was hoping for, get two or some fries if you're hungry."}
{"text":"I tried the Colombian hot dog and it was exactly what I expected, delicious!!! Also, the salchipapas were to die for. What I liked the most is that it's not your typical Colombian restaurant. It's more if a fast food style place but with good quality food. The service was excellent as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First time eating Colombian food!  Very different from Mexican or Salvadoran food.  I had the \"Granada\" with chicken, since I figured the dish for which the restaurant is named would be a great place to start.  It also comes with other meats and also a vegan option.  Huge bowl of food, with fresh roasted corn, seasoned chicken, cheese, crunchies, and a bunch of tasty mix-ins, very different than a burrito bowl or Salvadoran food, both of which I love.    Very reasonably priced, especially for the huge serving sizes which really could feed two people if I didn't devour it all.    I will definitely be coming back to discover more about Colombian food from their diverse and interesting menu."}
