{"text":"The best Poutine I have ever had. I ordered the smoked meat Poutine and it was TO DIE FOR. Service was quick and efficient. Make sure you get there earlier than you anticipate to eat because there is always a line!"}
{"text":"Que c'est bon! Poutine Toute Garni

L'endroit est petit, victime de sa popularité. Personnel très gentil, service rapide"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed. Although they have a variety of poutine variations to choose from, it did not taste spectacular. Nothing really special about it."}
{"text":"Je pense simplement que la poutine est bonne.  La sauce est pas toujours la même depuis quelque temps, mais on y retourne"}
{"text":"Descent poutine but my waitress was a miserable soul with \"gimme your damn order with no questions and rescue me from this horrific job\" kinda person. I picked the right day to come here I guess. We all have our bad days ha? But dang girl, we really don't wanna know about it. 

Wanted to ask a couple questions on their menu before ordering but the lady wasn't really in the mood to answer, impatient and wearing a poker face. Short and curt answers with a bit of extra salt. Ooookk, hurry Harry, place the damn order already!

This is the best memory I'll have of this place. it's your typical fast food greasy grub place with a good two decade old decor, nothing special but hey you get a bit of salty attitude if you pick the right day for that. That's ok, the poutine I had was good at least; well, could've made a better decision ordering another sauce had the waitress had 30 seconds for my questions. So there, take my 3 stars and put a poster with my picture at the entrance saying I'm banned to enter here for life :)"}
{"text":"Rest-Poutine is like a Waffle House in the states, except they are specializing not in greasy breakfast cuisine but equally unhealthy, but amazingly delicious, poutine, burgers, and other comfort foods. 

A stand alone establishment in Blainville, Rest-Poutine provided a somewhat convenient stopping point for us on the way to Mont Tremblant. Decor is dated... and just what you would expect from a \"comfort food\" establishment. Tables are simple and plentiful. Service was friendly and attentive. 

The Poutine - this was my first ever official poutine, I mean I have in the past had French fries slathered with say condiments or BBQ pork that fell off a sandwich,  but I never thought to market that mistake and name it something like \"poutine.\" I ordered the petite poutine with smoked meat $7.35 CAD while my wife had the petite vegetable poutine $6.85 CAD. The \"petite\" portions were actually somewhat large, and could actually be shared by a couple. The dishes themselves... well it was as I had imagined, delicious French fries topped with meat and vegetables. I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for in this dish, but it was filling, tasteful, and reasonably priced. I'm not claiming to be a poutine expert, but I thought it was good for what it was - French fries with stuff on top. 

Looking for something to ease the hangover from the night before, or your first poutine, or just for a cheap meal, then I recommend checking out Rest-Poutine. NOTE - they are cash only establishment but do have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine, as good & authentic as it's gonna get, hence 4-stars. The fries are just how I like them, sweet and soft with a lot of \"meat\". You cannot go wrong with the price. Of course it's better than La Banquise. 

Tip: go with small, unless you plan on packing half to go. People who know me can tell you that I eat a lot and halfway in my medium all dressed poutine it was uncomfortable to swallow (why is it called \"comfort\" food anyway, never really felt comfortable afterwards lol)"}
{"text":"Crazy busy, fast service and friendly, very fresh since its always packed, food doesn't have time to sit at all.  The place is small but surprisingly fits a lot of ppl, it's very cozy and has an outdated diner style that fits the comfort food. There's a nice terrace for the warmer days of the year. Everything ppl next to me ordered looked really tasty and everyone finished their meals. Ppl come from far to eat here from what I hear. I highly recommend this place. It has a lot of regulars and prices are great for the quality and amount of food you get !"}
{"text":"I read a review of this place some time ago from one of my favorite Yelpers and I immediately bookmarked it. A Mom and Pop comfort food/poutine place? Yes please! 

And yesterday, the day of reckoning was nigh!

It's a pretty easy place is easy to find with plenty of parking (always a good thing!) and their noon rush was pretty obvious yet was managed well. Made my way to the cash and was served immediately by a nice lady. I went with my gut feeling with a regular large poutine. She warns me it's a pretty big plate. 

I know what I'm about woman.

Asks us to seat ourselves and the food will come, so we opted for the open terrace as it was a nice day. We chatted and the food came within 10 minutes. 

Across the board the service was notably good.

So how's the food? The poutine was heavenly. Probably the best I've found off Montreal island for a long long time. The poutine hit all 3 targets it should. The fries were perfect. The curds were extra squeaky and generously spread. And most importantly, the gravy was amazing, the texture was something I really appreciated.

All this for a mere $8. This poutine was pretty much one of the biggest plates I've seen. This probably would have cost at least $12-13 if it was on the island of Montreal with a line-up outside the door (like the over-hyped Banquise).

All in all, I'm a fan for life. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"C est tout simplement bon ! Poutine Sauce italienne un gros coup de coeur avec de le viande fumé  en extra :)"}
{"text":"POUR - Ne suis pas amateur de poutine, une appelation d'ailleurs ridicule. Expérience désastreuse à Montebello, dimanche dernier d'ailleurs.

Ici, non pas un  choix unique mais 20 sortes de poutines.  Me suis réconcilié aujourd'hui avec ce mets. Goûteuse avec saucisses, bacon et champignons. Il m'en reste 19 autres à tester. Portion généreuse même du plus petit format (voir ma photo). Prix: 6,85 $

Tables extérieurs confortables avec toit protecteur en cas de pluie comme aujourd'hui.

CONTRE Pas de demie portion pour éviter l'abus que j'en fais ce soir"}
{"text":"This was my first poutine restaurant in Canada. If you think poutine is just some baked potatoes with some toppings on them, stop by here and they'll prove you wrong! I may be biased because this is my first time having poutine, but I would definitely come back if I ever travel to this side of Canada!"}
{"text":"This place is about as mythical as \"Schwartz's Deli\" in Montreal. 

Unequivocally THE BEST POUTINE in the north crown of Montreal. Perhaps not the best looking place, it's really a hole-in-the-wall, but sometimes that \"mom & pops\" place is really the best. No delivery, just takeout or dine-in. I highly recommend the smoked meat poutine, no veggies. You can also try their pizza, but the poutine is where it's at.

Trust me, you'll thank me."}
