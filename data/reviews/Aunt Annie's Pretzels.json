{"text":"Best Pretzel I have ever had!  If you live in anthem and have a resident card...you get a free Pretzel with purchase!  Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Gosh, these pretzels are getting pretty expensive!  

My little cutie pie and his cousins love them.  I bought 2 combos bite size pretzels with cheese dip and lemonade for like $15 bucks!  Mind you, that's only a snack.  Sure you're full right after that, but with carbs it doesn't last long until you're hungry again.  Once in awhile is okay...I tell my child.  It's ingenious to have the place right across from the outdoor playground where you can smell the buttery fresh baked goodies."}
{"text":"Ordered one parmesan garlic and one pepperoni. They were very bland and undercooked. The dipping sauces were cold. Only good thing was the service. Kids working there are nice. Aside from that, I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"One of the best Pretzels I have ever had (not over salted). The Pretzel Dog is simply the best thing that has ever happened to a wiener. Yes it is primarily a mall chain, but a damn good snack just the same (how poetic)."}
