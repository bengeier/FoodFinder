{"text":"Great food at reasonable price. Our favourite is the chicken tikka kabob."}
{"text":"The food was the usual of what you expect from a Hakka place. We did like their Fried Rice, it wasn't just rice with soya sauce, it actually had some flavour to it. Other than fried rice, we had ordered Manchurian chicken, chilli chicken, crispy ginger beef and chicken chow mein. Their version of crispy ginger beef was a little different, not the usual thin strips of beef like most places do it and I found their batter to be more crispy which I enjoyed. If we do go back here, it would be for their Fried Rice"}
{"text":"Quality of food is good. I tried noodles and soup (veg) both were good.  They have good options in veg and non veg too. And it has indian type flavor. But do request them to put less oil and more veggies in noodles. Rest all is oke."}
{"text":"My first time getting take out from here, I figured I didn't need to check what was in the bag but I wish it did. My noodles box was only half full and my chicken dishes were all 3/4 full for all three dishes. I felt cheated, compared to other places they charge the same but undercut they portion sizes by a lot.   I called to let them know that this was the case, they made no effort to correct their wrong, so I'll probably never go back.   So buyer beware, look at your order to see if they undercut the portion sizes for your take out."}
{"text":"Great Hakka type Chinese Cusine.  Friendly owner and great service.   Must try Sweet and Sour Manchurian Chicken"}
{"text":"Can't believe this restaurant has been open for several years now and I've only been here starting last month! Love the owners of this restaurant. So down to earth and very friendly.   Obvious favourite dishes include Chili chicken (both dry and with gravy), chow mein noodles, shrimp wonton, chicken pakora and shrimp pakora!!  One thing I wished they did was have a smaller portion menu (like the lunch size) available for dinner as well. Their dinner portions are quite large and is shareable amongst 2 people!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food was delicious. I called on a Saturday evening and they were packed but the lady helped me and was very nice over the phone. My food was ready within the 20 mins time period she mentioned. I was not disappointed at all. In fact I think this is going to be my go-to hakka spot in brampton."}
{"text":"Finally!! Hakka food without too much corn starch Most Hakka Chinese Indian restaurants serve very similar dishes. It also becomes difficult to differentiate the taste and quality. However, this restaurant serves all their food with much less corn starch in almost all their dishes, including sou, without losing the taste. Acceptable envoirnment and service. I would go there again."}
{"text":"I had no idea what Hakka food is until now. It just shows that I'm still uncutured and need to venture out more and dare to try new things.  Hakka is Indian/ Chinese flavours. I've been here twice and it is decent for the price. I've tried the General Tao and the Bombay Chicken. The lunch combo includes choice of soup or soda and plain rice or fried rice.  The owners are nice and hospitable. This place will be a regular lunch place for me on days I forget or don't bring a lunch to work."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Hakka places. I think this is a family owned restaurant as every time I have been here it has been the same lady behind the counter/serving and cook.  The restaurant is small but there are a lot of choices for food in the area so I assume they make most of their money through delivery or takeout.  I've tried a number of options but some of my favourite items are the shrimp spring roll, chicken fried rice and the mixed lo mien (soft skinny noodles served with chicken and shrimp).  The rice portion is ridiculous for one order lol! I have had the chicken spring roll but it was not my favourite because it was Indian flavoured (I know it's Hakka but I don't get the combination of Indian spices in a spring roll). I have tried their general Tao, schezwan shrimp and beef and broccoli but although good not worth the price vs the portion size.  The general Tao is filled with onions and 2/3 filled container.  I did give the restaurant 5* as it is a small business and I want to see them succeed!!! The taste of every item is authentic and flavourful.  The food is always hot once you get it home! I once ordered chicken Lo mien and it had no chicken but I called back and they gave me a free one on my next order!!! Great service, better than the big chains - I hope this place survives the competition! I forgot to mention; this place is packed at lunch! They have many lunch specials at great value!!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent (mostly thanks to the MSG I'm convinced).  I've ordered the food without MSG and as expected, it doesn't taste as good but it still tastes good.  Many foods here are heavily deep fried so regardless of MSG or not, your arteries won't be pleased, so be aware in case you have any health issues...  Haven't dined in here so cant comment on that experience.  Phone service is very friendly..."}
{"text":"Good food, their lunch specials are very good deals, but the main reason I come here is because of the friendly people working there, especially the lady that always greets you with a smile and usually remembers your name if you have been there a few times!!"}
{"text":"The flavours are on point, the food is hot and the service is friendly! Great experience, I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Hakka restaurant in the Peel region. The food is always top quality and the service is just amazing. We've celebrated numerous family parties at this place and we've always been extremely pleased with our choice.   Some of the must tries at this place are: fried rice, chilli prawn or chilli chicken (dry and spicy), the chicken pakora and their pad Thai!   Can't say enough about how great everything tastes. When you pop in, be sure to tell Angelina you read an amazing review on yelp!!"}
{"text":"I was out visiting a friend in Brampton and on the drive home I noticed a sign for Hakka Flavours. For some odd reason, my car just turned into the lot and parked itself out front of this restaurant, so only to oblige the car, my partner and I ventured in.  Now, I love Hakka food. When done right, the flavours/aromas will overwhelm your senses and leave you in a state of euphoria. The best place I've discovered thus far is a place called Fredericks in Markham.   We opted for a \"combo meal\" for 2. At $24, I wasn't expecting much. It consisted of 2 spring rolls, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Vegetable Chow Mien dish (noodle). I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was for the price point and the amount of food you got. We could not finish it all (except for the chilli chicken) and our waitress did offer to wrap up the leftovers for us to take home...which we declined.  The spring rolls were standard fare, the same you get anywhere. Chilli Chicken was in a wonderful spicy garlic sauce (which we used to cover the rice and noodle dish). It made the meal.   Waitress was very good. She recommended a lime drink and then came back to ensure we liked it. We did !  When the bill came it was incorrect. Had to point out that we ordered a combo meal and drinks, nothing more. The cashier said she'd have to check (but didn't leave to ask anyone) but she ultimately removed the item, but not until asking me again if I was sure I hadn't ordered the dish. Small hic-cup.  If out in this neck of the woods, I would venture in again."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Corn and chicken soup was quite flavourful. Ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch special. It was nice and sweet just like me as the server said! Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Ordered here for take out to try another Hakka place in order to find some of the best chilli chicken in Brampton.   No after try most places in Brampton and liking my chilli chicken extra hot I was let down. It was neither extra spicy or very crispy. However the value of the money was better the guddu's I found that the later had more flavor and gave me the spice I wanted.  That being said hakka village is still my go to place. While eating in is better than guddus, hakka flavors is nicer looking but you cannot beat the food at hakka village. They are quick to get food out, will add the extra spice and have many great dishes."}
