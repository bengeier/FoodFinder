{"text":"To me this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. The current owner, Tina, took over the old 'China Star' a few months ago and is gradually transforming it as a 'new Chinese' restaurant that mixed Sichuan and Taiwanese food. They are developing new cuisines every month. Tina's new ideas always make me happy and inspire me as well. For Chinese students, if you want some food not in the menu, definitely ask Tina. As long as she has food materials, she will cook for you."}
{"text":"We are from out of town.  In Pittsburgh for work.  From the good reviews, we expected at least a number 4 experience.   Not!  Just blah.  Asked for spicy - nope, didn't get it.  Dumplings were cold in the center.  Then on top of that, no toilet paper in the bathroom..  So here I am with pants at my ankles, duck walking across the floor for the something to wipe my arse..."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????40???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????= ="}
{"text":"Do you want to try authentic Chinese food? Ting's Kitchen is the restaurant for you. The food is not overly seasoned, the portions are generous and it's fresh. In addition to the pleasant atmosphere the food is affordable and the service is great.
???????"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with a large menu. We had Amazing Chicken, Bamboo with pork.
Each entree was served at a good temperature.
There was plenty of food and it was quite tasty.
The new owners were very attentive and kept checking to see if everything was good.
We will definitely go back and try one of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Ting's is without doubt one of the best restaurants we've ever been to in Pittsburgh. We have eaten at countless restaurants, and this was one of the best overall experiences. Food, service, ambiance - everything came together perfectly. Each dish is a revelation! One after the other. The service is extremely friendly without overdoing it; menu prices were very reasonable; parking is right next to the restaurant. Overall a truly exceptional experience from start to finish. We are regulars now."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, got seated right away. Everyone was very nice and the service was good. I had a pork noodle dish, asked them to make it a little spicy which they accommodated. The noodles definitely were not house made, they didn't taste bad, but I think they could have been of higher quality. They tasted and looked like the giant eagle brand of linguini.  The sauce and pork tasted good, I also had some fried dumplings as an appetizer, they were satisfactory. Would like to return and try a few different dishes.  Definitely don't see the 5 star rating here as of yet."}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese student in Pittsburgh, I am so glad that I could find this really good restaurant in Pittsburgh! First, I was amazed by the Taiwanese authentic snacks there such as ???? and ???? They are so authentic that I could not believe that I am in Pittsburgh at the moment. In addition, their Sichuan cuisine is really good and tasty~"}
{"text":"Really good food, and service. New owner, same good China Star chef. My dining companion is Gluten free and they offered her a few options of regular dishes that they could prepare GF. The menu is quite extensive with many options. That was my only complaint. It was hard to decide on what to get. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok so this is the worst Sichuan restaurant I've ever had in Pittsburgh. After I have seen many good reviews on here I decided to give it a try. Me and my friends ordered Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which taste fine, but they first server didn't give us the side dish ?? which is very important to the noodle until the second server told us that it look like something is missing in your noodle . Then she brought us some, which is nice. 
The Peking duck is the worst pecking duck in the planet I swear! It just some leftover duck which probably in their fridge in months and they fried it and it is called Peking duck.. It's not even half of the duck, two legs and some sort of random meat? And it taste absolute disgusting . The duck pancake is tortilla warp.. I highly recommend ppl do not order this dish.. You will regret paying 16.99 for this 
Chongqin ???is over salty and all the Sichuan restaurant I have had in Pittsburgh had better ????
Green bean is fine, not great because it is salty for me but not too bad. 
Nothing I like except this place is relatively spacious ."}
{"text":"A hidden Gem!! If you want something traditional done fresh and perfectly balanced you can get it here!! If you want to be adventurous and go deep into the cultures you can get it here too!!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Really great service and food. Seems very authentic to me. Very appreciative to finally have good Chinese delivery within my radius. There are a variety of dishes to choose from whether it be Taiwanese, Szechuan, etc."}
{"text":"Came by this restaurant with my mom and brother for a quick lunch. They advertise themselves as Szechuan and Taiwanese, and the menu truly was a mix of both. 

The owner was very accommodating and they offer hot water along with ice water, so you know it's real. 

The way to go is definitely family style, so we ordered the stewed meatball, braised fish filets, and roast pork minis to start. Each entree came with a hefty bowl of rice, so it was more than enough. 

The meatballs and fish came with veggies on the bottom, so you felt like you were getting your fill of greens. Both dishes were sauce heavy but delicious. 

My brother wanted a soup, so we ordered an additional lunch special of home style Tofu. Lunch specials came with a side of fried rice and soup. The sauce for this dish was overwhelming and will definitely ask them to reduce next time. 

Overall, it was a very good meal and a solid experience. I'll definitely be back and would love to try their turnip cakes."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Everyone is friendly. Especially tea smoke dum is my favorite! I like come here everyday!"}
{"text":"Tried the hotpot there. It is pretty expensive for a buffet. The choice of meat is limited.The soup is not flavourable. The vegies are fine."}
{"text":"Something just wasn't right with the General Taos chicken. Meat didn't taste right. Soup and egg roll were great! BBQ Beef was ok"}
{"text":"Since they've become Ting's Kitchen, they've become our new favorite spot to eat. My husband and I LOVE their Cumin Lamb. Perfectly seasoned and just SO good! Their menu has a huge array of dishes to select from.

If you're looking for an authentic dinner, I'd say stop here for sure. Their service is always great and the atmosphere inside is perfect for a casual night out to dinner or a date night dinner."}
{"text":"Was looking for some noodles in my area and Ting's had great reviews so I gave them a shot.  Their egg rolls are to die for! They are super huge and priced perfectly. Definitely recommend Ting's 100%!"}
{"text":"The food was Awesome. The Hostess was Awesome.  The Server was not. She threw our plates of food down and walked away.  She did not ask if we needed condiments.  The Hostess did. I tipped the Hostess not the waitress."}
{"text":"China Star is in transition to Ting's Kitchen and its going great.  I've been eating here for years and have always enjoyed their Szechuan offerings, which remain as delicious as before.  Now, the friendly and accommodating staff also offers Taiwanese fare, including fried fresh whole fish, which I couldn't recommend more highly.  The Tan Tan noodles are on point and so is the Fish in Flaming Pan.  Always happy to see these lovely people creating a great atmosphere and serving authentic, delicious Chinese food."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese fare here ... for those that don't know, this place used to be China Star, but the establishment is changing names (likely under new management). The interior is probably still undergoing some changes, but it does leave a bit to be desired. On the other hand, the food here is decent. I tried Zhajiang Mian, a typical noodle dish which I found to be alright in my opinion. The taste was decent although it would be nice if the cooks cut the ginger into smaller pieces so as to obscure the taste of the ginger (it still gets the job done in smaller pieces, no?). As for the Beef Noodle Soup with Tendon, I found it be acceptable. Wish there were more noodles and the beef was alright. The soup was probably the best part of the dish. The scallion pancakes here are on point ... I really like the little bit of sauce that is included with the appetizer. Adds a nice flavor to the individual pancake pieces although the dish stands well on its own, too.
Oh in general, great portion sizes here for what you pay. I like how accommodating the place is with side requests (i.e. can I get an egg with this dish? - yes). I look forward to trying other dishes the next time I get a chance to visit."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when I was looking for a new place to try.  I found the owner to be so great at explaining the menu which is quite extensive!  Many dishes on the menu that are not on your typical Chinese menu."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. You can get the American version or authentic Chinese food. Staff is very nice. The restaurant needs an update, but for me it's all about the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Only got their delivery once and it was about a year ago, but I remember it as being quite flavorful. Would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"I liked Tings. It had a nice, classy looking interior. The menu is pretty extensive and while it includes a lot of American Chinese food staples, it also ventures into a lot more authentic Asian cuisines for more adventurous eaters. I got to try the popcorn chicken as an appetizer and thought it was good and would be a great option for kids who maybe aren't into chicken with heavy sauces. It was very flavorful and you could definitely taste a lot of black pepper, but not too much. I also ordered the wonton soup which I found good and very typical of what I've had at other places. For my meal, I ordered the chicken lo mein and it was also good. It had some sprouts which I thought were a nice touch. It was also a giant portion as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Really low quality Chinese food and uninviting dining experience

This looks like a third world inside 

I can't believe McIntyre square allows this dump 

The food was gross

Literally full of grease 
I haven't seen many 'americans' there eating 

Sesame inn is way larger

Filthy all over 

It's ok for new immigrants but not for developed country folk 


Go to panda for first world standards"}
{"text":"There are so many things that make a restaurant special, it's not just about good food.... it's about hospitality too! I was very pleased to stumble upon tings kitchen (former china star) on yelp. My mom and I were looking for a place to have dinner tonight and I suggested we go here. 

When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the owner and taken to our seats. Our waitress came over and also warmly greeted us. She was very enthusiastic and eager to explain the menu items to us! I loved that. It makes me excited when other people find joy in talking about things they love. They are getting a new menu that will feature more Taiwanese style dishes! I can't wait to try it. Let's talk about the food!!

I ordered the lamb in sichuan style (17.95), the lamb was thinly sliced and was mixed with veggies with a hint of spice. It also comes with a side of rice. My mom ordered the zha jiang noodles with ground pork. It comes with brown sauce! The portions are really large, which is always a plus. I did give my moms dish a try and I loved it! So tasty!! Our waitress was nice enough to bring out a few dishes for us to sample different Taiwanese style foods. The one plate was filled with Taiwanese Chicken Steak (amazing), there was nothing boring about this chicken and it was extremely flavorful! The second bowl was noodle soup with pork and shrimp also very delicious! The last plate was the Taiwanese Pork Buns, these were also very tasty and a bit crispy which I like! To end this fabulous dinner she brought out Taiwanese grass/honey jelly and lemon jelly for dessert. I gave the grass/honey jelly a try, but couldn't get onboard with it, but I loved the lemon jelly!! 

I would highly recommend coming to this restaurant if you are looking for an authentic meal and friendly service! I will be coming back and with my friends:)"}
{"text":"I'd like to take this opportunity to announce my beef noodle soup quest, detailed as follows:

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Mission Statement: Try ALL the beef noodle soups
Mission Justification: Beef noodle soup is really freakin' delicious.
Secondary Justification: It's winter and I really freakin' love soup.
TEAM:
Team Lead: Me
Team Members: Husband, Friends who can be dragged to various Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants
SMEs: Fellow Yelpers
ACTION ITEMS/NEXT STEPS:
[1] Go to as many Taiwanese/Chinese restaurants as possible.
[2] Order the beef noodle soup.
[3] Slurp.

Now that that's out of the way, here's what I tried at Ting's:

HOT & SOUR SOUP: a fairly standard cornstarchy favorite.  Packed with egg swirls and veg/tofu matter.  Not bad, but needed some peppercorn action and was vastly improved by the hot sauce (a chunky chili paste) I asked for.  Then again, what isn't?

PORK & HOT PEPPER: husband's order.  Not very special.   I tried to talk some sense into him, I swear, but tragically failed.  Would suggest one of the more traditional dishes--anything \"over rice\" or the zha jiang mian (sort of like a Taiwanese spaghetti bolognese).

That's it.  Har har, I'm hilarious.

BEEF NOODLE SOUP: decently flavorful broth though not as rich and deep as Rose Tea Cafe's.  The beef was a huge step up though, though it was NOT tendon, as the menu advertised, but thick chunks of a nice fatty cut with some gelatinous bits.  Not completely flavorless, as most soup meat tends to me.  I ate the gelatinous connecty bits and left the rest for hubby, as I often do.  [SIDEBAR: depending on who you are, you likely feel he's incredibly fortunate to be with a girl who likes the \"weird\" bits/cuts of meat, as this leaves him with the prime cuts, OR that his life is incredibly sad.  If you're the latter, let's be friends.]  Noodles were nothing special--not fresh or handmade.  Toppings included some fairly bland chopped pickled mustard greens and a halved stalk of baby bok choy.
BNS SCORE: 2.5/5

Our friends ordered the SIMPLE NOODLE SOUP WITH PORK/SHRIMP, BRAISED BEEF OVER RICE, and ROAST PORK MINIS.  I'm devastated to report that not only did I not try them, I woefully neglected to even ask how they liked them.  Though, judging by the fact that they had both cleaned their plates when my soup bowl still looked untouched, I'd say they didn't hate it.

No free desserts here, our meal ended with your typical nonsensical fortune cookies.  We did receive some fried wonton chips with dipping sauce to start.  One item of note, however, is that the service here is very much above average for an East Asian eatery.  Maybe it's because I was at a table with 3 white people and they profiled us (we also received forks and no chopsticks), but I believe they actually came by at one point to ask how we were doing.  What is this, a pasta place??"}
{"text":"Taiwanese/Szechuan food is probably the number one Asian food you can find in Pittsburgh.  There are so many good competitions that you end up actually having to make an effort to decide where to go.  Ting's Kitchen is my choice if I am up and about on Mcknight.  Their \"wife and husband\" appetizer (spicy tendon and tripe) is so good.  It honestly beat out this other michelin-star chinese restaurant I went to in NYC.  I also enjoyed their tea-smoked duck, fish in spicy broth... and I love that their menu is extensive so I can always try new things, or stick with my favorites.  The restaurant is fairly empty whenever I come by, but the food is on point.  Everything I order is super spicy.. I love and hate it at the same time.

Just a fair warning, if you don't order spicy food here then (maybe) you're not doing it right!  Don't come expecting authentic chinese food but order something Americanized or typical.  Taiwanese/Szechuan food is very distinct.  Ask for recommendation and be daring cause the food is on damn fireeeeeee (I mean spicy, not literal or overhyping)."}
{"text":"I stopped by to dine in for lunch while shopping in north hills. I normally stick to my usual Chinese takeout in my neighborhood, but the reviews here were good and I was craving it

I ordered the lunch special general tso chicken. I enjoyed that the special is offered on Saturdays. It came with white or fried rice- no up charge for fried. I also got to choose egg roll or soup. I chose egg roll. It was huge and so delicious not even kidding. My lunch entree was a decent size and the general tso sauce was good.

The main reason for 4 stars is service. Everyone from server to food runner was extremely kind. The lady at the front also bussed and cleaned tables.. In heels y'all. (You go girl!!) 

Anyways if you're in the area I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday for dinner and it wasn't overly crowded. There are tables for big groups near the back, with plenty of booths and tables throughout the restaurant. The service there was very friendly and patient with us as we looked through the menu. 

We ordered the roast duck noodle soup and the simple noodle soup (which was touted as the #2 Taiwanese soup on the menu!). The food came out quickly and I was blown away by the amount of duck in my dish! For $11, it was a very generous amount and I was very happy with it. The duck noodle soup was considerably larger than the simple noodle soup, but portion wise, both were enough to fill us up to our content. 

Overall, the dishes tasted good, were a good price for the portion sizes, and I would like to come by again sometime to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"If you come here looking for Ting's and Taiwanese food but still see the China Star sign out front, come inside because you're at the right place. Nothing about their menu gives away the new offerings here--you'll have to make nice and talk to the staff (or just wait a couple weeks if you would rather do that). The owner is super friendly and made several recommendations for their Taiwanese specialties, which range from noodles to rice dishes to appetizers like fried chicken. We were impressed from the beginning at the presentation and care they put into making the dishes, and of course the taste of the food as well. 

The fried chicken was made Taiwanese style, which is not very greasy and comes with a breading that is crispy and thin. The meat was still very tender on the inside, and the outside was seasoned with chili powder. The zhajiang noodles were very tasty--good texture, sweet sauce but not overly so, and a good helping of ground pork. Beef noodle soup was fantastic, rivaling the same offerings back in Squirrel Hill. The broth was deep and savory, the beef was soft, and there was the right amount of leafy vegetables, pickled vegetables, as well as a well-made tea egg. We were also offered a dessert of lemon aiyu jelly, which was cool and refreshing. Overall a delicious meal, especially considering that the owner and her husband actually puts care into making a lot of the dishes themselves."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! The chicken nuggets for appetizer is a MUST, and Taiwanese beef noodle soup is so good! Definitely will see my face here quite frequently. :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about going forward with my decision to try this place, since the reviews were mixed.   However, convenience and  location came into play for me to go with it.

Ting's is located in a shopping plaza, so parking was easy.  I immediately connected with the warm and inviting dining area.  Definitely a nice option if one is looking for a relaxing environment. 

The menu was easy to read, even though it was a bit extensive. The staff was very friendly, and we were given plenty of time to review our options.  Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was nicely prepared. It was not over-cooked, nor was it swimming in oil. Serving portions were plentiful. 

Nicely done Ting's.  Based on this experience, I place my checkmark in the recommend column."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was very good and big portion on the soup! Had the crab rangoon, pork steam buns and simple noodle soup. Wish it was spicier but ill get xtra spicy next time. If you're looking for something that's not american-chinese this place has some interesting tastes to explore"}
{"text":"Great restaurant to go after the rebranding. Food is getting better and better. A good choice for local Chinese restaurant. The menu is renewed as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place used to be called \"China Star\".  It is under new ownership but the restaurant has not been renamed on the door yet.  They said it won't happen for another 2 weeks or so.  Till that happens, it is going to be the old name with old menu.  You can either wait 2 weeks for things to settle or just ask for the new menu like I did.  Just don't get confused by the door sign.

I had conflicting reviews from my friends about this place so I decided to check this out myself.  From yelp, I also learned that they do both Taiwanese and Szechuan food.  (just to clarify, Szechuan is the southwestern part of china known for their spicy food, and Taiwan is the eastern-not-so-part-of-china).  

We tried both the Szechuan and Taiwanese dishes.  And I am looking forward to their new Taiwanese menu.  

Boiling beef (Szechuan) - the beef was soft and done right.  But the sauce was nothing but salty and spicy.  it is supposed to be more complex than that.  and to be honest there are better Szechuan restaurants in squirrel hill area. (3/5)

Taiwanese beef noodle: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=6yQcm5wONjI9M9cCg_o8ZA) one of the best in town. (5/5)

Taiwan chicken nuggets (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=NLq9ud9hNAw-QnFpv7V3aw)  crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  I think it is thigh meat not breast meat, which would be a plus. but i am not 100% sure. (4/5)

Taiwan pork rice (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=4LUy7n-J7Ca9jZE44QF_hg)  it is really really good. but rather small.  I have heard they do lunch box / set dinner version too, hopefully those will be bigger. (5/5)

Zhangcha duck.  The biggest surprise of the night.  Crispy skin and fat enough duck.  (6/5)

There were few more dishes too. and free dessert (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tings-kitchen-pittsburgh?select=k8IU71im9pTAWFiiSEVz8g)

overall, I am looking forward to this place and certainly will be back again.  Just wish them best of luck, as their location is not ideal.  I won't be coming if I do not drive.  hopefully, they will do well in this Uber generation.

final verdict: best Chinese food in Ross township if not north of Allegheny"}
{"text":"Great quality food; service a little brusque but efficient; tea smoked duck super tasty but nothing but duck on the plate so best to order some side veggies. No alcohol here! Will go back to explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gems around Pittsburgh. Best place to go for lunch around the mall!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Szechuan food with real peppercorns! The kind that numb your tongue a little. I got the red pepper dumplings which, I think, we're filled with chicken. Very good! Because I like things a little more on the spicy side, I got the cumin beef. It was good, not great. Slightly spicy, could use more heat. I would probably order something else next time just to try other items. Also, the more \"authentic\" items, as opposed to the Americanized items like general tzso's or crab ragoons, are a bit more expensive. If you're looking for something a little more authentic in the Pittsburgh area, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Asian food in the Pittsburgh area.  Owner is very friendly, definitely would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"a great place for takeout!  they have a wonderful menu of traditional Chinese cuisine or specialties such as Taiwanese and Szechuan.  I played it safe going with the Kung Pao chicken but don't worry....next time is gonna be a little buck wild.  You know without a shadow of a doubt when a place serving ethnic cuisine is good when the entire restaurant is filled up with that same nationality of diners!!!!  My girl went in to acquire the food...and was the only white human in the whole damn restaurant!!!!  She said it was like stumbling into the middle of a conversation when everyone just stops and looks at you....  
With that being said, I had the Kung Pao and my girl had the chicken with mixed vegetables.  Both had lean delicious white meat, perfectly cooked veggies, and flavorful sauces.  I would say as of right now, this is the lead dog when looking for take out chinese in the North Hills suburb...."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and everything is absolutely amazing.  Try something new and I can bet they'll deliver an amazing dish.  If you need direction, try the curry lamb.  That has been my favorite dish so far.  If you like offal this place is for you.  The kidney and the sliced beef combo are both top-notch."}
{"text":"Sorry Ting's, I was having a pretty good dinner with my wife until we found something in our food (silica gel packet perhaps?, see the attached picture) which turned both my wife and I off.  As such, this will be a quick review unlike my usual ones.

My wife and I headed here for dinner because I was excited to order their chongqing chicken. We ordered the red chili dumplings as our appetizer and they were decent and comparable to others we have gotten recently.  Then for dinner I went with the chongqing chicken while my wife ordered the salt and pepper squid.  My chicken came out first and actually was quite good.  It was hot temperature wise and super crunchy.  Actually it was some of the better fried chicken that I have had recently.  There also was some numbing from the Szechuan peppercorns but what I thought the dish was really missing was some spice.  Yeah it had the dried red peppers on it but I never had to take a drink of water.  After finishing my dish I started to help my wife with hers.  The squid itself was overcooked and so chewy and the whole dish felt rather dry.  After having only a few bites we noticed the item in the dish that shouldn't have been there and immediately called a manager over.  They thought it was a rice noodle at first but we persisted and they saw it wasn't.  At that point they assured us not to worry and that it wasn't a big deal and that they would bring us another.  Umm, no thanks.  They did take it off of our bill and my wife and I quickly paid and headed out of the restaurant.

The bottom line for me is that I won't be heading back here again in the future.  While mistakes do happen, I actively avoid places where you find something in your food that shouldn't be there."}

{"text":"Lovely clean Chinese eatery in town! The owner -- Ms. Ting is super nice and friendly. She provides authentic Taiwanese street food \"????\" style dishes -- delish and homy! What a surprise in P-town! The same location was originally another Chinese restaurant focused on Sichuan dishes (famous for spicy, heavy kicks), Ting maintained this part, but also tries to expand the menu a bit, bring the Taiwan (where she's from) flavors to the table.

The group of us are all from China, and we are fed up/so satisfied by these great food! A must try if you are in P town craving for authentic Oriental dishes: warm hearted service, fresh ingredients, sophisticated cooking skills = satisfactory eaters. Would def come back to try more dishes. 

PS: DO ask Ting about daily specials not on the menu, she probably gonna surprise you."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers are going there for lunch everyday. We absolutely love their food. The flaming pans are so tasty. If you like spicy, try beef with hot pepper. I also like their beef noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. I recommended the Taiwanese lunch box if you just want to have something simple and delicious."}
{"text":"After my mom warned me that this place's Chinese food is more authentic and doesn't taste like the normal Americanized Chinese take out, I demanded that we stop here! Not only am I too darn hungry, I'm all for trying more authentic stuff! 

Ordered 2 servings of chicken fried rice, 1 order of Ho Fun noodles with chicken, and a side of white rice. The man at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful, as I asked him about two of the noodle bowls and what they contained. After I ordered, he asked me what I'd like to drink, and when I requested water, he gave me a bottle! Quite nice of him. I was told the whole order would take 15 minutes. 

The place is very calm and quiet, though it was sparse at the moment. I imagine if there were more people, it'd be crazier. In fact, they brought the food out in a little over 10 minutes, which was awesome.

Undortunately, the food is rather....bland. It wasn't that bad, since when I put soy sauce on it , both dishes tasted much better. The noodles were undercooked and partly hard, and the chicken fried rice was rather insipid. I don't know if this is what more authentic Chinese food tastes like, and my taste buds are not used to it, or what the case is, but I'm open to trying it again. Maybe these dishes weren't my favorite, or eat-in might be better."}
{"text":"We are big fans of szechuan food and we're super excited to have found this place in the north hills! Delicious and authentic. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous food in a plebian strip mall. This was some of the best Taiwanese and szechuan food I've had outside Chinatown. Very minimal decor but our waitress was helpful and charming. Doing really well as a non native English speaker. The cheandong shrimp will.haunt my dreams, it was just shrimp and dry hot pepper with szechuan peppercorns absolutely delicious as was the double cooked pork belly and hot and sour soup. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the best in the North Hills of Pittsburgh, and quite possibly, all of Pittsburgh. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new take out spot."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Chinese restaurant ... owners David and Tina treat us like family and the food is always excellent...friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"What a surprise and treat this place was. With such a versatile menu, things like kidney and intestines are available.

I had never been here before but i passed it once and was curious about what Taiwanese was like. So my husband and I took our nephews here and we looked over the menu and decided on some pretty interesting things. I order the chilled kidney along with the intestines that are served in a hot pot. My husband ordered Duck and some fried rice for the rest of the table. He's not much into trying new things.

The kidney came out first and was surprisingly delicious. It has the consistency of squid but not so much the flavor. They marinated the kidney in a spicy sauce that had a lot of oil in it. The intestines were even better they came out in a wok style dish with a little flame underneath to keep it hot and bubbly. There were green onions, white onions and a few peppers to compliment this dish.

The duck was very delicious, some of the best I have ever had. I don't know whether they barbecued it or marinated it but it had a delicious smoky and sweet flavor to it. Plus duck is  fattier so it wasn't dry like how chicken & turkey can be sometimes. The fried rice was a good complement to the side dish. The only thing that I didn't like was that a lot of the food was cooked in way too much oil. Other than that the spices were very good and the presentation was as well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the real thing foodies.  A jewel stuck in the middle of a random strip mall in Pittsburgh.  This is not a typical Chinese restaurant (although they do the American Chinese stuff fine).  This is a straight up Szechuan and Taiwanese powerhouse.  Tan Tan noodles are ridiculously good.  Red Chile Dumplings are a come to Jesus experience.  If you love that tongue numbing feeling of real Szechuan peppercorns you must try the Boiling Fish soup or Triple Pepper Chicken.  These are not dishes dumbed down for an American palate, they are full of heat and flavor.  Do yourself a favor and resist the urge to order from the typical Chinese menu they offer and stick to the Szechuan and Taiwanese offerings. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I thought there would be some napkins or a plastic spoon and a fork. Unfortunately, nothing, only some packs of sauces.
I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Ting's Kitchen is an absolute delight! If you're at the Ross Park Mall like we were and want to stop somewhere close by for a delicious dinner or lunch- check out Ting's.

Ordering from the Traditional Taiwanese menu is the way to go. I got the Simple Noodle Soup which was wonderful. Rich broth, noodles, bok choi, shrimp, hard boiled egg, and pork pieces. All seasoned so well making this a great meal staple. I also tried the Red Chili Wontons- GET THESE! Sooo yummy! Just the right amount of spicy and all flavor. My husband got the Chong Qing Chicken off the Szechuan menu. This also had fantastic flavor! For my tastes though I wish it had a dipping sauce to combine with the rich flavor of the fried \"popcorn\" chicken.

The decor is simple and the lighting is low with delightful background music. Overall it was a delicious traditional meal and a comfortable dining experience. We will definitely be visiting again. I got my eye on the Szechuan Beef and the Hot Pot."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of traditional Taiwanese dishes as well as the most popular Chinese-American specialities. Each menu item our group ordered was served promptly with fresh and properly cooked ingredients. We really liked the friendly and knowledgeable staff and service. Prices are reasonable. BYOB..GOTTA TRY IT!"}
{"text":"We have a great time at Ting's and can't wait to order more items from the menu.

On a whim we stopped in for lunch and ordered a few items to share.  We stayed with the Szechuan menu and liked what we ordered, with exception to the shrimp in scallion sauce starter.  

The staff were super nice and attentive and made great conversation with us.

We'd go back and will."}

I arrived for lunch. Got seated right away since there were not a lot of people. I asked my waiter about the change. He told me they are still working on it and the full menu has not been completely changed out yet.

The first few pages of the menu is your typical Chinese American flare which you would find at almost any restaurant. The last couple of pages which has Chinese writing on the side is your Szechuan menu. If you want to know what is on the Taiwanese menu then you have to ask your waiter for those menu items.

A lot of the Szechuan items I was told were authentic Chinese food and much of it is very spicy. i lot of those items were pork items but they had some items that were chicken, lamb, and even fish. I asked the waiter what kind of chicken they use for that preparation and I was told dark meat because it is \"tastier\" when preparing Szechuan foods. I was exploring the fish options and he recommended one which came with Tofu. Normally it comes very spicy but I can order it non-spicy if I so chose and would get a dinner portion for a dinner price. Note-there are some items on this menu which you can get a lunch portion on and save some money.

I asked about what kind of fish it was and it was something I never heard of. I was debating whether or not I should order it bland but then I thought that it would be tasteless unless it has some flavor to it. So I decided to stick with the American side and ordered chicken breast with vegetables. Since it came as a lunch portion I ordered that. You have a choice of fried or white rice and one side which can either be a soup or spring roll. I opted for the spring roll.

When I got the roll I found it a bit difficult to cut with my knife but it was otherwise okay. My main course arrived shortly afterwards and it was a smaller portion with  enough basic fried rice. It was good but very similar to what you would get at most other Chinese restaurants.

I was given a bagged fortune cookie and wasn't offered a dessert as I had seen in other reviews. However, when I got my check it was written on it 5% discount if you pay in cash. I'll take a break like that anytime so I was able to get that discount once I told them I'd pay in cash. 

This place is okay but I still prefer the one I ate at in Mt Lebanon earlier in the summer. It will be interesting to see what happens once they complete their renovations and put in the rest of the Taiwanese menu.  I was able to chat with some people at the next table who had ordered the Szechuan lamb dish and although the portion was generous I was told it was spicy hot! Please keep that in mind if you can't handle hot spicy foods."}
{"text":"Ting's is tucked away in a shopping center by Ross Park Mall. Although they offer Sichuan and Taiwanese cuisine,I definitely think their Taiwanese food was their strength. 

We ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, pork belly over rice, and a chicken flaming pan. The Taiwanese chicken was definitely my favorite of the three - it was well-flavored and crispy, and I also really liked the crispy basil leaves in there. The pork belly over rice was good and a decent portion for $6, but I have had better elsewhere. I was disappointed by their chicken flaming pan. First, the chicken was a strange pink color (I'm guessing from the spices that they used?) and was barely spicy at all. The waitresses were really sweet and our food came out very quickly as well.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but it's a good place to stop in for some authentic Taiwanese food if you're out doing some shopping."}
{"text":"Yummy food! We love the duck and spicy shrimps.  Our kids love their food too! Place is clean and they have a great staff! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Omg at long last traditional Asian cuisine in North Hills. Tonight we feasted on turnip cakes, scallion pancakes (both freshly made) turnip greens and intestines, salt and pepper squid. I'll be back again in search of the land and sea combination in the winter melon and clam soup. If you know traditional Asian food you'll want to dine here!!!"}
