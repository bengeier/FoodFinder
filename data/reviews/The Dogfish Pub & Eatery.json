{"text":"Dogfish Pub & Eatery is close to the house we're renting while visiting Toronto so we gave it a shot last night (Saturday). I'm SO happy we did! They offer great views of the lake and boats coming in to dock. The owner and staff were super nice and the service was great. The pub is immaculately clean, which is a huge thing with me. We shared pulled pork dirty poutine, calamari, and a fried fish dinner. Everything was perfect. And the portions are huge. They have a nice selection of local craft beers, and Cuban rum, a treat for us Americans. A true highlight of our trip! Thank you, Jon and Lisa for making us feel at home."}
{"text":"Came for the view. It took over an hour for food to arrive and was cold when we finally got it. Poor customer service and left extremely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"After walking around the park this is a great place to warm up and get some grub. It's pub food done well, a great view, lovely service, all at a decent price."}
{"text":"If I could score less, I would.

Spent over 20 minutes sitting on the patio this evening, without so much as a nod.  

There were a few people at the bar and only 2 other tables.  The waitress dropped something and did a clean-up.  We saw a least 3 other staff members inside.

They were totally aware of us, they just chose to ignore us.  So we walked.  

We went to Buster's by the Bluffs pub at Kingston and Warden, unfortunately, their kitchen was closed, but, they recommended Andrew's at KR and Birchmount, so we went there and it was great!  

Thank you Buster's.  No thanks DogFish.  

Been here before with old owners and are missing them already."}
{"text":"Today was a beautiful afternoon to be outside, on the edge of a Marina, watching the boats and having a nice regular coffee. This place is all about location. 

The site is grand, and the bruschetta that we shared, was more like a pizza, but with the setting who cares?

My wife said it was like a mini-vacation."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking around Scarborough Bluffs. Great little pub with friendly people and decent food."}
{"text":"Really great spot on the water at the foot of the Scarborough Bluffs, nice patio, free parking, friendly staff.

To echo some other reviews here, service was slow ... I don't see that as an issue with the servers, they were friendly with us, but the space was understaffed today - that's on ownership.  

Lost a star for falling prey to Toronto's inability to deliver a non-greasy British style fish n' chips.  Just because you're on the water doesn't mean that you do fish well.  People should think good tempura when they think fish n' chips - light and crispy, not soggily soaked in oil.  Change the oil in your fryer a bit more guys."}
{"text":"The staff are rude and unaccommodating. The food was slow and and forgettable. This place is a good example of how bad staff can kill a business. Never again!"}
{"text":"The staff is rude and the owner is rude too. Service is extremely slow and we felt like were left forgotten.  When having a beer waiting for the food, the manager came and grabbed our condiments in such a rude manner without any explanations. We figured they probably thought we were not ordering food, so went and told the waitress that we are waiting for the fish and chips please don't take the condiments.  What shocked us was their rude attitude. The first waitress asked \"what's the big deal if you don't have food on your table\"?? The manager came later and lectured us again \" what is the big deal if there is no food on your table\"?, she went on that she had been there managing for 20 years and we only there for 15 minutes therefore she knew it better than us ... excuse me... first we were waiting for the beers and food for almost an hour and secondly no respectful bar/restaurant manager would ever talk to customers in such a rude manner. 

Furthermore, the so called owner came out defending his employees again questioning his customers what the big deal was. Although we informed repeatedly the attitude was the problem sadly he did not appear to understand.  

There are issues with This bars service standards and we do not recommend. Bad review."}
{"text":"Great place at the yacht club where you can eat some fairly decent food and a fairly decent price. The fries are extremely tasty. The view is very relaxing as well. The staff is friendly. Just watch out for seagulls if you eat outside."}
{"text":"Nearly empty restaurant yet food took almost an hour to arrive (we shared an appetizer). It was cold when we got it, like it had been sitting out a while. Overpriced for the quality of the food. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great spot yet a hit or miss with who you get as a server! Could be really good or go terribly wrong! Food is ok again if busy might be a bit of a miss! The fancier restaurant upstairs same thing! Servers can make or break a restaurant so select wisely! One bad one can result in never returning!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and says good things about this restaurant. She's very right! We ordered seafood pasta and it was delicious. The coffee is just right. Great atmosphere. Lisa provided us a wonderful service with a smile & we were lucky with beautiful weather no cloud in sky. Sitting outside listening to birds singing near water"}
