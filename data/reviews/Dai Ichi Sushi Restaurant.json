{"text":"Have been coming here for years for lunches and dinners. Food is consistently great and of high quality. Staff are always friendly but service can suffer in speed during very busy times. Will be a regular for years to come as food quality always comes first."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday dinner on Saturday and we had a group of 10.  We ordered 3 50pc sushi/sashmi boats as well as tempura for everyone.    I was disappointed with the shrimp tempura as it was soggy in the middle so that tells me the shrimp is not very fresh as the batter was crunchy and the vegetable pieces were all very good.    The 50pcs boat was nice but not out of the ordinary.  Pretty standard fare basically anywhere in the city.  They didn't bother to tell us what was in the boat which I've gotten used to recently so maybe that's the norm(?).   We didn't know what we were eating which seems odd to me.  Service was good otherwise and they were quite attentive for our group.    Average run of the mill Korean/Japanese sushi restaurant.  Meh."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! If you are looking for fresh sushi, this is NOT the place for you. I didn't even finish my lunch platter; the sushi quality was so poor. The spicy tuna roll smelled \"fishy\".  Sorry to write such a review, but I wish I read this review as a deterrent to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service and presentation was spectacular. Sushi wasn't so great. Extra complimentary side dishes were delicious. They're drinks were great too. Was very cold as well, had to ask to turn the heat up. Bring your jackets!"}
{"text":"We heard of this place through a friend.  Let's just say it is better than wherever we used to go.  The pricing is a touch higher, but the quality is higher as well.  I usually get the spicy bulgogi.... Which is $1 more than the regular bulgogi.  However, 9 of 10 times it is  worth it and tastes great.   Their deep frying is pretty good.  The batter is light and oil fresh.  (I've also had the chicken tempura and pork chop a few times.)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant! We order once a week for take out.  The food is fresh and tastes great."}
{"text":"No doubt this place is one of the better establishments in Mississauga for Japanese & Korean food. Just visited the restaurant today with my family. My wife loves the spicy salmon and my son enjoyed the California sushi. The chirashi sushi I ordered was deliciously prepared. The staffs offered hospitable service. We recommend this place for the quality food and service. Will certainly come back for more if we are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm going to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and assume that the chef was just having an off day, but I was really unimpressed with the bulgogi last night.   My husband and I had a late lunch (or early dinner, depending on how you look at it), and spent around $130. My husband is a big eater (and over orderer) and we ordered drinks. Not a bad sale for a Thursday afternoon in an empty restaurant.   We ordered sashimi and sushi, which was fresh and well prepared, as usual. We decided to take an order of bulgogi to go, because we were so impressed with it last time (I figured it would save us from doing dinner later, or at least hubby could take it to work the next day). Previously, we had eaten a perfectly soft, well seasoned simmered beef dish, generously portioned. I suspect that ordering the beef to go gives the kitchen the idea that they don't need to put the same care into the food, and the portions can be reduced. I was really irritated when we tasted the lifeless, chewy meat later that evening. It was a huge disappointment.   We will probably give Dai Ichi one more try, but we will never order anything to go ever again. Just because they are convenient does not mean we will continue to eat here if the food quality diminishes any further."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality and friendly staff. One of my most favourite sushi places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better sushi places in Mississauga. Fish is very fresh and good quality. Best spicy salmon roll I have ever tasted - just so refreshing.   The only reason I took off a star was because of the price. If it was not as expensive, I would definitely come more often. The food is very delicious, but sometimes it was not very filling if I only ordered a few rolls."}
{"text":"I had pork bone soup and sushi platter. Food was not authentic. There was unusual ingredient substitutions on pork bone soup. Sushi presentation and taste was not good. Price was expensive . Taste ranged from sub par to okay overall. Service was so-so. Decor and cables cleanliness was good. Don't go unless you are desperate."}
{"text":"This is a real Japanese restaurant. Quality of the food is outstanding. Have tried tempura (vegetal and shrimp), different kinds of sushi, temaki (hand roll) and sashimi, all tasting fresh and delicious. Even the starters (salad and missoshiro) were good. Excellent choice to eat in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Went based on yelp reviews and was not dissapointed. Did takeout for lunch. Got the salmon teriyaki bento and the sashimi/sushi bento. The portions were good. The sides in the sashimi bento were so tasty (glass noodles and korean style veggies). Definitely will return to try their korean dishes."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good value and service is wonderful. A very friendly atmosphere and Food is always delicious!  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Like a typical Korean-Japanese restaurant, this one does not deviate disappoint. The environment is casual and relaxing, with the lights dimmed at an appropriate level great for couples, or for families. They have private booths for a more intimate experience, and large tables for gatherings.  The quality of their seafood here is superb. I've dined here countless times and if you're a sashimi lover, I'd recommend the sashimi boat as it offers a wide variety of fish. Their sushi rolls are also great and fairly priced.  The staff and service here is great. Don't be shy to get to know the owner here, she tends to give you complimentary smoked mackerel head which is not on the menu!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi! Super friendly, very attentive staff! We sat in a private booth/\"room\" that's super cute & very cozy, which has a button you press to call for serve - they come back to your table very quickly! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious: Fire caterpillar roll, Dai Ichi supreme roll, Volcano roll, Dynamite roll, Christmas roll, Bacon dragon roll.  Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars: Location is a bit run down (but as soon as you walk into the restaurant you are greeted with such enthusiasm, you quickly forget the outside appear). The decor is a little dated, but still kinda cute! Also, it was a bit warm in the little private booth/\"room\" (but you quickly let it go & enjoy the super cute surrounding). It also sounded like the kitchen might have been using a microwave - not sure for what!?! Maybe the non-sushi stuff???...because the sushi rolls definitely tasted fresh and not microwaved!  My family also enjoyed their green tea cheesecake and green tea ice cream!  We will definitely go back!!! LOVED it!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here after a long absence.  The sushi is always good here and I wanted to try the Korean food too.  We weren't disappointed as the sushi boat was fresh and tasty.  The korean pancake was crispy fluffy generous sized pancake with tasty seafood and vegetables.  The stewed tofu was also good and came with sushi rice.  The only criticism is that the service can be a bit slow.  Once you get their attention you're good but they seem to leave you alone versus checking up on you regularly.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times now for takeout and it's always been the same. The helpful Korean woman at the front, they all greet you when you walk in right away and they are fast! Did I mention the food is outstanding?  I got the spicy salmon roll which was delish and the appetizer sized jap chae which I found they make the best.   There isn't much I can say besides they are pretty authentic, clean, friendly and their good is incredible. I wish more people knew about them with how good they are what what they do!"}
{"text":"Great, well priced Japanese Korean restaurant.  They have a wide variety of dishes on their menu and the food is quite good for the price. Most lunch bentos are around $10-13.  Would def come back!"}
{"text":"Fire caterpillar roll and kalbi are good.  Korean dishes poor quality and give tiny servings. Service meh :-("}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this place! The sashimi was quite good and they have a great selection of premium rolls. Each table has a buzzer to summon the server - so convenient and prompt. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Salmon they use to make the roll and sashimi are not so fresh! Hubby and I both got diarrhea after having dinner in their restaurant. Ruined our Christmas! Will never go back there!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  My last visit was in May 2017 and we haven't gone back since because this place is not the same.  They may have a new chef or new management.  It used to be a quiet lovely place, enough customers but not a zoo.  In my last two visits, they were very busy.  Their sashimi were not as fresh, tempura were soggy, doughy and tiny.  Bulgogi was overcooked and tasteless.  Most important of all, their services, used to be warm and attentive, were rude and slow both times.  Both times we got \"Tammy\" as our server and this woman was rude to the extreme.  Never came around to take our order or fill our cups.  When we rang the bell, she came 10 minutes later and gave us \"the look\".  Last time we were there, she shouted right out of little \"private room\" and told the other waiter that we were leaving, when we haven't even ask for our bill!  We ate what they gave us, it's not like we were taking a LONG time finishing our meal.  Their food was not that great to take this kind of insults!  Would never go again."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place for sushi! We've been customers since they opened (2001)...when we moved into the area. I'm so spoiled now, I compare all other sushi to Dai Ichi's  Service is always pleasant & efficient, food fresh and consistent. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Tucked in a plaza by the Longos at Laird & Winston Churchill.  I visited this little spot coz my little and I were craving some sushi.  We came on Saturday at around 12:30pm.  There were lots of patrons but it wasn't full.  They have some tatami rooms and some booths.  It's a quaint spot.  Food:  the sushi was good and the fish was fresh.  They do need to give a bit more wasabi.  There is a very little dollop of it with about 2 slices if pickled ginger for a serving.  The Tempura Udon was par to most places that I've had this soup at.  There is nothing to rave home about.  Service:  Maybe it's the way the restaurant is laid out?  The booths do block you from being seen easily by staff?  However, it took quite some time to get someone to take our order.  Basically, they came to drop off the menu and never really came back.  They had the table doorbell to flag them for service.  I personally don't want to have to use this.  At first I thought maybe they just had 1 server which wouldn't have made sense since they had 2 sushi chefs at the bar.  I had to look up over our booth divider to check well, turns out there were 3 and 2 of them were kinda just hanging out at the counter.  So, press the button it is.  1x...2x...oh maybe 3x the charm.  Finally!  She seemed annoyed I rang the bell.  So that takes off a full star.  The rest of the service during our lunch was pretty meh.  So, this didn't really make up for any issues at the very beginning.    With that being said, I wouldn't necessarily completely cross it off my list.  However, o also wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  If in the area and craving sushi....hmmm...maybe."}
{"text":"Want to give 5 stars but the takeout is kind of slow, especially in the last couple months.   Sashimi is very fresh, if you've only done AYCE then you'll be in for a treat in the quality. Staff is very friendly and they remember you which is nice. Their other dishes like bulgogi n bibimbap are great also"}
{"text":"As close as it could get to Korea Town.  I was craving one of my favourite Korean dishes, Kam Pong Gi, but didn't feel like driving all the way to Korea Town to get my fix. So the only solution was to find something as good or close to good as Korea Town in Sauga. Yes, I know mission impossible, but I was determined to find something especially since I live in Sauga. After looking up the majority of the Korean restaurants in Sauga I went straight to their online menu to find my dish. This was the only place that actually had it so that made it alot easier. MIND you I did find out later on that there were 5 other places that had the dish I still have yet to try those other places.  So me and my boyz and girlz arrived at the place and all I have to say is WOOD.  From the walls, sushi table, booths to all the tables. The waitresses are dressed in a kimono or a Korean outfit, I don't know if there is a difference b/w the two if there is please let me know. BTW don't be mad if you think the service is crappy b/c it isn't, you just have to find the call bell, they answer that bell as soon as you press it. Lastly one thing that I really notice was the T.V monitors playing the golf channel, Koreans love their golf.  The menu was pretty big, containing a good mixture of both Korean and Japanese, price wise for a dinner or lunch deal you're looking at $15-20, which is pretty reasonable considering you get unlimited apps, soup, salad, and rice. Sushi is roughly $1 per piece, maki rolls $10-$15, and a boat can go from $20 and up.    We ended up ordering Kam Pong Gi, Spicy Bulgogi, Bulgogi, Kalbi, Volcano Roll, Lobster Dynamite Roll, and Lobster Tempura. Good amount of food to feed 8 people. The Kam Pong Gi, which is kinda like the Korean version of General Tao Chicken, but way better, fulfilled my craving. My only complaint about it was that it wasn't as spicy as the ones from Korea Town, but don't get me wrong if I were to just order that item I would be very satisfied. The Bulgogi, was just okay, but if you get the Spicy Bulgogi that hit the spot, very flavorful and a lot more depth than the regular Bulgogi. The Kalbi was very well marinated and cooked just right. The maki rolls were good but there were little things that I was not a fan of. For one the sweet potato that was added to the Volcano Roll ruined it however I did like how they lit the roll on fire when they brought it out. Great presentation. As for the lobster roll and tempura I will never get it again b/c honestly it's not worth the price and it just tasted like a bigger version of a shrimp tempura.  One last thing on the dinner items, they are definitely share items, I'd say if you split one of the dinner items b/w two people you would be full.  In the end I found a new Korean Restaurant in Sauga and have been a regular since.  Items to definitely get:  - Kam Pong Gi - Spicy Bulgogi - Kalbi - Spicy cucumber (free app if you get a dinner combo)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice over the course of 8 years and gotta say, both times it was great!   For me, this place has a special spot in my heart as it's the first sushi place I went after starting my first job out of school. I went here with a colleagues who were starting at the same organization. We ended up at this place by accident, originally looking for another place to go to at the time, and back then, Google on a mobile phone wasn't the greatest so we really didn't have any other options at that point.   The place was a Korean run sushi joint but the food was very fresh, authentic-feeling with lots of great and fresh flavours. We ordered a large sushi, sashimi, roll combo boat for a table of 10.   Fast forward to today, and again, this place was on-point. Had 3 lunch special boxes, I had the sashimi, roll and sushi box with a nice variety of everything. Colleagues had something similar and look, for an a-la-carte joint, this is a great place to end up eating. Prices are fair and you'll be happy in dining here. What really makes it is the service. The service is very friendly, fast, and for regulars they remember your order and have it ready for you once you give them the nod.  I also got take-out from here a few weeks later and couldn't be disappointed. put together really well with what looked like lots of pride and ownership. The type of sushi you want to eat, especially if you are eating in an A-la-carte environment.  Giving this 4.0 out of 5.0 and stand by this."}
{"text":"Been in Mississauga for 20 years but never knew about this place.  Was yelping to see where is a good place to eat on father's day & made a reservation.  Got a private booth & order volcano roll & sushi platter.  Had high expectation for the volcano roll but the fire ran out in few seconds.  Sushi was ok but definitely had tons of option at cheaper prices around the area."}
{"text":"Upon second review, I am usually fond of the quality of their food. However I had found consistency that when it comes to takeout deliveries, they take hours to make. They tell you on the phone that it will be ready in 45 minutes, only for you to arrive and noticed that they haven't started the order yet.  The restaurant is not even busy where people are outside of the doors yet this is an example of poor time management on the business side."}
{"text":"Great sushi date restaurant with my son. We shared the tempura appetizer and the maki combo with three rolls. Perfect for a light meal. Including beverages and tip the total was $36 which I think is reasonable. My son absolutely loved the experience and called it his favorite sushi restaurant EVER.  (And the name sounds like it is straight out of the Simpsons. That is just a bonus:) )"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had. I always love coming here. The food is always fresh and the service never fails to be friendly and inviting. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning Korean food, in the most unlikely nook.   The storefront looks a little crappy... tacky 80s yellow coloring on the back-lit plastic awning, and the window menus (and photos) are all sun-faded, giving this restaurant a slightly run-down, almost sketchy appearance from the outset... IT'S ALL A RUSE, by god! Enter enter enter!  The interior is decked out from back to front in a Korean aesthetic. Your choices of seating are either super roomy booths OR curtained private rooms which seat up to 8 people. You get menus and waters immediately, but the best part of the ordering is that every table has its own silent doorbell, so you push the button when you would like the server's attention, being ready to order or for any other matter. Great idea!   The menu is very large, and despite the name of the restaurant, the menu is weighted 60/40 Korean vs Japanese cuisine, the latter almost exclusively sushi & teriyaki with some udons . My partner and I ordered two different kinds of tea (green and gin seng). Between us both, we ordered a dol sot bibim bop (meat/rice/veggie dish served in a cracklin' hot stone bowl) a spicy Udon seafood soup (Udon is thick, long noodles), and an order of Toro (fatty tuna) sushi. The food was excellent, hot, fresh, flavorful. There's almost nothing I like more than a well-served dol sot bibim bop (it's one of my favorites), except spicy Udon seafood soup from Dai Ichi Sushi, apparently. I couldn't stop sipping from my partner's soup with all it's succulent fish fat flavors, and a spicy punch to finish off each slurp. The sushi was super. I could eat here 100 times a year, if I lived closer.  The only caveat I could possibly muster is that the servers and staff are made to wear \"traditional\" garb. I'm already ambivalent when the interior of a restaurant aims for some impossibly abstract delivery of \"authenticity\" - but when the staff is forced to perform some strange trans-historical simulacra of \"tradition\" - I just feel self-conscious and weirded-out. If you have a costume fetish, however, then this place will meet your need. In any event, it couldn't POSSIBLY effect the 5-star quality of the food and service.  It's listed as being on Winston Churchill (which is where the driveway is located), but the Dai Ichi Sushi storefront is actually in a small strip mall tucked just back from Winston Churchill itself, partially obscured from view... just do a google maps search to find it."}
{"text":"I would give this five stars because the food is delicious, the quality is excellent, and the atmosphere is great but the service is slow. That's my only complaint, I love this place. Great Korean food and top notch sashimi."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. This is a great restaurant and a paragon of deliciousness! I have tried their sushi, sashimi, kam pong gi, bulgogi and bimbimbap. All of which i might add, were excellent. One of the waitresses in particular is extremely polite, friendly and always has a welcoming smile. She knows my family and always welcomes us. That is not to say that the other waitresses are not polite. She just stands out.   The food always comes on time and reasonably priced. I like the decor very much. They have tvs where you can watch sports updates which is nice. Another feature worth mentioning is that they have these buttons you can push to notify the waitress that you need something. This is convenient, and i think it should be a mainstay in all restaurants. They also have private rooms which are perfect for family dinners. Overall, you should try this place asap!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were there for lunch a few days ago and each had bento boxes. I had the one with salmon teriyaki -- terrible. The salmon was drenched in loads of a thick unpleasant sauce, and the piece of salmon itself smelled absolutely terrible. (Maybe that's why they tried drenching it, to mask the foul smell. Salmon shouldn't stink.) The tempura batter was thick and oily. The miso soup was salty and weak. I couldn't try much else on my plate because of the smell of the salmon. I had to push the tray way off to the edge of the table just to avoid breathing it in. Servers passed the table several times and no one asked whether everything was alright. My husband didn't think much of his bento box with chicken either -- said \"everything tastes like it was made in the same shoe.\" We waited a while for the server to finally check in with us.  Positives: the booths are nice because the partitions are high so it feels private, and the servers are nice. Still, overall it was an unpleasant experience. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I haven't been to an a la carte sushi place in over a decade. Since the local discovery of the AYCE, I haven't gone back. Yes, I will sacrifice quality for quantity in some cases. Not all.   That being said, we found ourselves at Dai Ichi a week ago. After the initial sticker shock wore off, we set about finding a comparable meal to what we would normally order at an AYCE. My bf and I settled on bento boxes, plus a maki roll to share.   The boxes were nice and just filling enough that you don't leave hungry. However, individual components of the box were troublesome. The salad dressing was too watered down. Also, the chicken in the teriyaki is obviously of poor quality, in fact seemed like a pre-made product that was heated in bag and dumped into box. The flavour of the sauce was weird. My bf said the same for his salmon teriyaki, poor quality fish with strange sauce. The rice surrounding the maki roll was too hard and seemed a bit stale.   The tempura, however, was amazingly delicious and redeemed the meal for us.   Service was pleasant enough, non complaints there. They seemed to have a very loyal customer base that does regular take out. They remembered all of their names which was impressive.   For me, if the meal was outstanding, I would have no issues with the overall cost. However, we have had better meals at the AYCE down the road for less money. Due to that, I will likely not return to Dai Ichi."}
{"text":"Waitress greeted us kindly. We got to sit in the cute secluded booths. We ordered the Dai Ichi, Pork Bone Soup Kalbi Steak and Spicy Scallop Roll. The food was served quickly and we were very satisfied with the portion size and taste was fantastic. I would visit again when I am in Missisauga."}
{"text":"We've recommended this place to many people and they like this as much as we do. The owners are so personable and they always remember us. We get great banchan (free side dishes) that are so delicious with our meals. The fish is always fresh and the portions are very generous. The quality is high and consistent.   I will admit the sushi and sashimi are not creative. You usually just get tuna, salmon, yellowtail, octopus, shrimp, tamago, and the usual california rolls. The korean dishes are really good and if anything, they're better than the Japanese dishes. I love the kalbi, bim bim bap, and spicy bulgolgi. The tempura is well done and not heavy or overly oily. I usually crave them once in a while. Overall, really well done food and possibly the best value because of the large portions."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my home. Service was good very friendly, I ordered sashimi dinner, the fish wasn't fresh at all, I was scared that I might get sick so I didn't finish it. Never eat sashimi over there again."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to sushi restaurant of choice. Everything always tastes fresh, staff is friendly and the sushi is simply delicious! The tuna loves roll is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every week when I was younger. It is one of the best sushi places of Mississauga that isn't AYCE. Loved the service & the food. (Y)"}
{"text":"By far my fav sushi place to visit!  Freshness is always guaranteed and is way better than any other sushi place I've ever visited.  Prince sushi has proven to be decent and reliable.  But D'ai Ichi is even better.  I've been to many all you can eat sushi places and have never been overly impressed (Y'es, Heart Sushi to name a few).  D'ai never lets me down!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were craving for sushi on Friday. We decided to try Dai Ichi out after a friend of mine told me how great it was.  The prices were a bit more expensive than Sushi One (where we always go to when we hangout) and they didn't have many sushi dinner selections. However, they had a lot of variety for their Japanese and Korean dishes! Me and my friend really wanted to the Yaki udon but we stuck with sushi because that's why we were there in the first place. We both ordered the maki set dinner.  The service is relatively fast because we didn't have to wait very long for our order to arrive. The sushi was amazing! I think I said it was so good at least twice during dinner haha! I was amazed that the maki rolls didn't fall apart and they tasted scrumptious! Usually california rolls are just okay but the california rolls here were yummy. The spicy salmon rolls were quite spicy for me (I can't tolerate spiciness) but they were so good that I just had to eat them. For dessert, they gave us fruit instead of green tea ice cream which was a surprise because many places give out ice cream instead.  I would definitely go back and try their Japanese and Korean dishes."}
