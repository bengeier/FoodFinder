{"text":"I have sent several emails about the questionable service at Bubble before and unfortunately I have ran into the same issue again this evening. On May 20th, the gentleman that works the general admission had the same excuse that I have expressed several times in previous complaints. The party was promoted as \"Magnum Mondays\" which I perceived was an open public event, however, the man working the door expressed that this event was a private event and you needed tickets. Nevertheless, I explained to the individual that I have complained about this issue several times and that I wanted to speak to a manager and he said that the manager was not available. I, then proceeded to go upstairs to talk to the bouncer upstairs and told him that I wanted to speak to a manager. There were two men that came outside to let in several other patrons and apparently those individuals were managers that the bouncer failed to inform me of and when I told him that I would like to speak to the manager, he told me that the managers were busy with other \"issues\" going on in the lounge. I do not like to throw around the \"discrimination allegations\" term but I could not help but notice that a majority of the people that were denied entrance into this establishment were of African-American descent. I am just having a hard time trying to understand why I cannot get into a lounge that I have partied at several times before."}
{"text":"This is the first place in ages that I can honestly say.....I'm too old to be there. Having said that, I went there after work (about 6pm on a Friday - not 2am) for cocktails. Having made it through the front door (and greeted the young friendly lady), and up the stairs (and greeted the 3 lovely ladies huddled around a desk), and across to the bar (greeting a nice young waiter on the way), it was safe to say we were here now for at least one drink - too embarassing to walk out and say bye to all those nice young people. It's not a very inviting place, and even when empty we really were unsure where we were welcome to sit.  Every table had empty plates and empty champagne glasses set. So, we sat at the bar......next to a pile of half eaten plates of food (it looked good, even half eaten).  These were cleared quickly, but then we realized everyone else in there was an employee - mainly preening for much later that night. The drinks were fair - but I don't think the actual ingredients listed in the cocktail menu were used for the drinks we ordered.  When we left, other than being sober, I felt like the last stragglers leaving a night club in the early hours of the morning. Empty, it's not inviting and the atmosphere is one of anticipation for a busy late night. I'm sure it's rocking with beautiful people much later, so give it a try if you like to splash the cash as the last stop of the night and share your evening with fellow champagner guzzlers."}
{"text":"Global Bites at Bubble was not worth the time or cost. They did not have the foods from the countries that were advertised.  The food was cold and very mediocre.  The drinks were just a small taste."}
{"text":"Great place to go especially on Mondays! The managers Josh and Ian always make sure you are treated well and that service runs smoothly. They always have different DJs and a diverse crowd which makes partying there a different but fun experience every time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at the Bubble Lounge is a classy upscale spot where all will be comfortable.    Our waitress Jade, was knowledgable and attentive. She was very friendly and eager to please, but not annoying.  She kept our table clean and checked on us frequently.     My friends and I shared the shrimp cocktail, prosciutto wrapped melon, and the Margarita flatbread.  The flavors of each plate were amazing. Loved the presentation of each plate as well.    My friends and I tried several delicious cocktails too, the Carrie Bradshaw, the French 75, the burning orange, and the Francois.  My favorite was the Burning Orange.  It is vodka, OJ, lemon juice, muddled jalapeño, and a sugar rimmed martini glass - YUM!  If you like spicy, this is the drink for you!!   Our entire dining experience was fun and relaxing.  I highly recommend this tastefully decorated modern restaurant and lounge."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, but does anyone know how much VIP tables cost? Im looking for my birthday."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot the food was good the service was excellent. I would come back again I haven't experienced the club part yet but when I do I will do another review."}
{"text":"I went there last night with money to spend.  I left with my money as I saw no opportunity to spend it.  This is the closest thing to a strip club in epicenter.  Plenty of young girls wearing tight clothing, dancing around.  This place is NOT mature at all!"}
{"text":"Bubble is my favorite nightclub in Charlotte. I like the bartenders, Julie and Todd are great! The Bubble girls are all beautiful and the ambiance makes it a terrific night out in the QC.   The clubs management always makes sure you're taken care of and are on point. It has a very unique design and the feel of a night out there is one of a kind. If you have never been you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Hosted a high profile private event here for my job for a large Charlotte-based retailer and had a horrible experience. We paid for a private area that had random people sitting in it when we arrived. We asked the staff to please kindly ask them to leave, which they did; however, the rest of the staff kept seating people in our area. We had a specialty drink that we were paying for which was being served to the random people sitting in our area - and being added to our bill. None of our drinks or food was ready when we arrived. We only had one waitress assigned to our area and she was very absentminded. My colleagues and I had to end up serving our guests. We had created a PowerPoint to play during the hour that we were there, which was sent to them several weeks before our event. When we arrived, it was not playing, and when asked for it to be shown on the screen, we were told it \"didn't work\" even though we were ensured it would be tested prior to our arrival. Would not return here personally or for business ever again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome mix of electronic dance music, classy vibe. Please stay the same! Will be checking in often for a fun night of dancing and club life enjoyment :-)"}
{"text":"From what I was told, sneakers and boots are against the dress code. Being a private club, i have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is allowing admission to 4 people with sneakers/boots right after denying admittance to my friend and I. I had on sneakers and my friend had on Polo moc-toe boots (def. not Timberlands). We were also given the excuse that the club was at capacity which was a blatant lie (we knew people already inside).  This is just another reminder of why I stopped going to clubs at the epicenter in the first place. My money is green, but when you don't fit the correct demographic it doesn't matter. And before you ask, we were completely calm and reserved.  Good luck if you try to go in the future. Maybe you know the right people,smh."}
{"text":"My African American friend contacted Bubbles to get pricing for a girls night out.  The response she received was interesting to say the least.  She was told that the place was very upscale with a very upscale dress code, that they only played house and edm music, and did not carry hennessy, patron, or ciroc.  This bothered her because she did not ask for this information.   She asked a Caucasian friend to send the same request and surprise, surprise, none of this information was included in the response from the lounge.  Also, she was quoted a cheaper price that what my friend was.  I am not one of those people that calls everything racist, but this does seem a bit suspect to me."}
{"text":"My friend and I had 6pm reservations on a Friday night - way before the cool crowd showed up.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  (I feel so bad for the servers in high heels!!!!!!)  The food was good.  The B's cheese plate was generous but yet not memorable.  We also had the arctichoke and prosciutto pizza, tuna tartare and strawberry chevre salad.  All tasty but the dishes could have used seasoning.  For the money, we could have gotten better food elsewhere.  I also didn't like that they couldn't validate the $10 Epicenter parking."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this restaurant/bar/club whatever you want to call it. They have two entrances...one on the first floor and the other on the second floor. Second floor is usually exit only so you may want to enter on the first floor. There's only two bars and a patio that look into the streets of downtown. It's very small inside and dead. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. The food is pretty good but the bartenders are bad. They don't pay attention to you and they don't give you enough liquor. It's watered down. Not a great experience!"}
{"text":"I hesitated to write a review about this place because I wasn't sure how I felt about it until now. I'm not a big clubber anymore...more like totally opposite now. I'd rather go to a cool bar or nice restaurant to hang out...Anyway, needless to say I was no too thrilled when I was asked to come here the first time. When I saw how close it was to Suite I pretty much assumed the same crowd and atmosphere.  1st VISIT: I liked the area up the short stairs/ramp. It was more of a place to eat appetizers or have a drink at the bar and chill, it also leads outside where you can do the same (there is a bar area where you can order drinks out there as well). The bartender had some personal issues she should have worked out before she got to work. So her nasty attitude put me in a negative mood from the start. After an hour people started pouring in ( I think it was around 12 am) and that's when I started to here music that reminded me of \"sandstorm\" and I was reminded all over again why I don't like clubs. It's like the atmosphere went from cool and swanky to ...a rave? We left. 2nd VISIT: I had a friend come into town and he wanted to visit a nice club...ugh! what other choice did I have? I was hoping maybe it would be different this time.  I was right! the drinks were still great but our bartender was amazing he had a great attitude. The crowd was even better they were older so we didn't feel out of place. And the MUSIC was actually good! No sandstorm. We stayed and danced all night...only slight negative is that the guys were a little thirsty, every time my friend walked away a guy would literally run up to dance/talk (whether I wanted to or not) to me and run off when he came back, 1 guy actually stuck his card between my hand and glass as my friend came walking back. Some may find that flattering but it's actually why I don't plan on going back. Because touchy/aggressive guys are another reason why I don't like clubs :-/  but if you do I would say give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is good for AA5 events in the summer and most Mondays because of good drink specials  But other than that I can't go higher than a 3 because it seems like too much cramped in one small area and the crowd that frequents seem stuck up and unfriendly"}
{"text":"The worst place that I ever been at. We came 30 people from Winston Salem , the manager Jim was rude. The security kick some of us out without any reason!! After asking Jim why u do it to us he said \"I don't care\". It seems that he the security kick people out just so they can let new people to come in . A manager suppose to give costumer service! They ruined our new eve ..  and it's not the first time that they ruined my night but certainly it's gonna be the last time , I'm not going to go there anymore."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner a few weeks ago and they can do better. Going here to party and have a night out is another story, just don't come here for dinner. Portions are tiny compared to prices, nothing is cooked to order (steaks), our waitress was just not paying attention and I just don't understand why it took so long for our food to get to us and then like a half hour for checks.The wine by the glass options are few and far between and you would think that for a place called bubble they would have more options for champagne and desserts, but they hardly had any, not even strawberries?  It was very odd, I do like coming here for a night out or as a stop on my party route but I won't eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Love this place already. Great ambiance. Slightly more mature crowd. The focus is on good champagne by the glass. Beautiful decor! Bartenders are fast and food was pretty good for opening week. We had the homemade chips with blue cheese pancetta dip (very good), tempura battered veggies with chipotle sauce (interesting - large pieces of carrot, great beans and asparagus - but not great), margarita flatbread (average or below), filet (cooked perfectly with a nice herbed butter topping) and creme brûlée (well done).  Our meal and drinks were awesome, but 4 times during our meal other table's meals were attempted to be delivered to us. Our bartender/server was great, but hopefully those other kinks get worked out."}
{"text":"awful, awful, awful!!!! All the way to the skinny GM who clearly spends his evenings ripping back redbull in place of food..... I use to go there often, and it was so, so when DjDirtyUSA would spin.  I get there, and the bouncer rips the corona out of my hands without telling me I amnot allowed to bring it in bathroom. When I say something to him he threatens to have me kicked out. Then as I am walking out there was a couple fighting, and blocking the exit. I said something to the couple, and another egotistical overgrown manchild they call bouncers PUT HIS HANDS ON ME!!!! I CALLED THE SKINNY GM OVER, AND HE CALLS COPS ON MELOL.....cops come, and threaten to take me to jail....good ole' cmpd for ya!!!! what losers!!!!  THEY ALL NEED JESUS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Bubble as an evening lounge spot/champagne lounge, but this is the first time I have come here for a sit down dinner.  I will say that the food was pretty good, but nothing outstanding when compared to restaurants with similar price points.  The service could have been better as well.  When I asked what the chef's vegetable of the day was, the server said \"I don't know, it changes everyday.\"  It is important for a place that is serving dinner to have staff members who are knowledgeable of the menu and available options for the day.  Our server also was unable to provide any recommendations of what was good on the menu.  I would also say that if Bubble is looking to expand on the dinner market, then appropriate seating options would be a good thing to think about.  We were initially seated at a high bar table with stools that had no foot rests on them, so your feet literally just hang down  a foot off of the floor.  Very uncomfortable set up for dinner.  We were reluctantly moved when asked, though we were initially told that all of the other tables (in a not very full restaurant) had been reserved.  This was interesting, being that we had reservations as well and also being that the whole time we were there, there may have been 5 other tables utilized."}
{"text":"Such a sad display of service!!! The champagne was great, the apps were good, too! The problem is it took FOREVER to get the drinks and food. The server was slow and too busy socializing to help us."}
{"text":"Great outdoor area!! Love the music middle aged crowd I had a ball. I enjoyed the mojito tasting and the bartenders were very friendly and gave a lot of advice about ways to enjoy the city! The decor of the. Place is just gorgeous"}
{"text":"BUBBLE IS MY EFFING PLACE. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because they consistently only have one bouncer outside of the door instead of two or three. When you're doing an 18+ night you should have more bouncers so the lines aren't ridiculously long for everyone involved."}
{"text":"Moet White Star + Emily the server / bartender were perfect!  Not a club goer but I stopped here with my hubby to get some apps and champs after an event I went to and before things got clubby at Bubble. The menu is definitely a little pricey but that's to be expected from a champagne lounge. The vibe is upscale and sparkly, the giant Barbie framed art is kinda funky and weird but Emily our server and the Moet White Star were absolutely perfect! Emily helped me capture my fly and took a billion pictures of me until I was satisfied with the outcome. Thanks girl. Also tried the shrimp cocktail, they were gigantic and fine tasting but when I go back I'll probably just stick to the bubbly."}
{"text":"Had my 21st dinner here. Staff there was really nice, love the service. The food was kind of expensive for the portion that was given but the quality was great. I didn't buy any drinks so I don't know how pricing went but the bartenders were also kind. I stayed a little later to see get the feel of the nightclub. Ill say it is more for a mature crowd, really chill and nice. More lounging then clubbing which I prefer more. I will definitely visit again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very cute club. I love the big round booths and the huge photos of Classic Barbie on the walls. From what I understand on slow nights, you can usually get a table and have some tapas and drinks without that whole dance club aspect, but on key nights - Friday and Saturday - there will be a line and the entire place is converted for dancing and bottle service etc. so make sure you check what's up before you hit it.  It is right next to Suite and has entrances on the 1st and 2nd floors."}
{"text":"Bubble is easily one of the best clubs in Charlotte and I think it's Monday night party known as Magnum Monday is quite possibly one of the best in town. From the front door staff to the VIP managers (ask for Billy) you always get the feeling they are here to make your night worthwhile. Once inside it's a free for all with a gorgeous outside balcony that overlooks the city. Great high end vibe to this club! Expect EDM music for the most part on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the call I just got from this place. I booked a table a month ago for a friends bachelorette party for ten girls. They call me the day before the reservation to inform me that they ended to booking the whole restaurant for a party and wouldn't be able to keep my reservation. So I was stuck calling places for two hours until I could find somewhere to accommodate us with a 24 hour notice during one of the most popular times of year. I am horrified that's the way this place does business."}
{"text":"Okay let me preface this review by saying that I am not a big Epicenter club person. I like to go on occasion however this was a horrible experience. I understand that places like this want to seem elite and bigger than they are but they treated us pretty poorly. We went for a friends birthday and when we got there the place was dead empty! I understand that they have all these spots for bottle service only but we were a rather large party and we were dressed to impress and ready to spend some money. We were asked to move three times before they basically shoved us to the bar and said that was the only place we could be. We watched a lot of other people (who were not paying for bottle service) allowed in the other areas that we were not. I had one friend alone who spent like $600 that night not to mention we were a group of 10 plus more who joined later. I was so annoyed at our initial treatment that I just couldn't enjoy myself there and I for sure will never be back. Places have policies in place for a reason I get that but if you see a large group there to spend money you would think that common sense would dictate that you cultivate that and make allowances so they will spend more money. Regardless of treatment the place isn't laid out well, and the DJ wasn't very good. I didn't have a drink so I can't comment on the cocktails although I hear the bartenders were good. They at least were friendly where no one else who worked there was."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  Prices can be somewhat high for certain drinks, but the atmosphere is so cool.  When you walk in, it seriously feels like a 60's cigar lounge with neon lights and plush half moon booths.    This place is new and I definitely think there are still things they need to work on.  First, if you are a bar/ nightclub-- the wait staff should be well versed on your drink menu AND the prices.  Second, if you are going to specialize in a wine and champagne -- make sure you have SOME beverages that are under $15 a glass-- unless you only want people to stay for one or two drinks.    I like that this place caters to a more mature crowd by encouraging conversations over drinks."}
{"text":"Bubble is by far the most racist atmosphere I have personally dealt with. I've been there many times with black males and we were told you MUST have a table to get in or they tried the \"we are at capacity\" BS ( mind you as we are still standing there, a group of \"others\" walk straight in with no problem) . Little did the doorman know, I know a coworker in there who confirmed the club was empty. SMH! The crazy thing is we were prepared to buy a table but Bubble staff couldn't see past our skintone, therefore we never got to that point. ALSO.....regardless of your race ladies, if you have one extra cookie worth of weight on you they WILL deny you entry! MY POINT HERE IS STAY AWAY FROM BUBBLE AND THEIR IGNORANCE. I AM CONTINUING TO SPREAD THE WORD. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL QUICKLY BE SHUT DOWN OR RETHINK THEIR NONSENSE."}
{"text":"Fascinating nightspot in downtown Charlotte.  The DJ was playing funky country music or something and it really got the crowd moving and grooving.  I got a rum and coke and it was very good.  Full of flavor and alcohol.  Bartender complimented me on my top hat and we shared many funny stories about life.  People around me were eating and it smelled good, but I was too busy dancing to eat!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and decided to check out Bubble on a Wednesday night.  My coworker and I sat at the bar and was told about the $5 Bubble Bites and half price wine. We're both wine drinkers so this was perfect.  We shared a margarita flatbread and med spread.  Both were very good, the pizza was crispy and the med spread came with flatbread and I ask for a side of carrots/celery...maybe consider adding veggies to the spread?  Bartender was nice and chatty, so overall a fun experience.  I'll be returning when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Bubble is fun to check out, but not a place I'd stay at for a long period of time.  It has an upscale ambiance along with upscale prices.  The cover on weekends has been as high as $15, and basic house drinks run around $6 with a weak pour.  There isn't a dance floor, but a bit of space in front of the DJ booth.  It seems as though the venue wants to cater more toward VIP service so the general crowd doesn't mingle as much.  The decor inside is beautfiful and the bathrooms are always clean.  They have an awesome view from the outside patio too!    It is too pricey for me, and seems to be trying to be something it's not.  However, I'd check it out to see if it is your vibe!"}
{"text":"This place would let people in after 1:30 when they \"close\" at 2. Absolutely unbelievable. Stood in line for 30 minutes and then they told me that."}
{"text":"Clubs. I mean, if you're in the club scene you know how it is. Loud music, those bathroom lines with a ton of people, and well you know it...over priced drinks. You know it when you go to clubs, you're expected to spend money, this is a given fact. The place isn't the nicest, but it wasn't the worst.   Inside isn't the best, but there's plenty of dancing going on and for sure you can have a good time. One thing I thought was a little weird was that the tables were right next to the dance floor, there was no separation or any borders. But, the one good thing which is common at other clubs, was that the liquor were locked so random people can't just take your drinks.  I mean, shit is expensive. Especially on event nights. NYE, was a little crazy, but it's expected and there should be no surprise. Bubble wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best that I've ever been to. I'm solely talking about the layout of the club and service. I'm not rating anything on price of drinks or any price wise. I expect a high bill, and whatever comes with that night. All in all, I had a great time, but if I would to rate a club, it's just okay. Nothing new and no surprises."}
{"text":"The food is decent the beer selection sucks. Our waiter Casey was a complete tool he treated me with disrespect from the moment we arrived rolled his eyes and gave dirty looks and short responses to questions. The hostess was very nice but Casey made the experience awful. I almost walked out after the water came out."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambiance, sweet hostess but our waiter Casey acted like a tool to my boyfriend the whole time.  Didn't seem too inclined to answer questions about drinks and food."}
{"text":"A nice lounge/bar/club in EpiCentre.  We planned to come here after the Hornets game and we were pleased!  Drinks were incredibly heavy-handed and priced just right for what you get (although my liver is upset with me right now).  The food, too, was pretty good.  I had the calamari and it was a large, tasty portion.  I even tried the cheese plate and LOVED the selections.  When the club scene started, the people were great but I was not keen on the tunes (too much techno, not enough hip-hop or Top 40).  Still, we danced and had a good time!"}
{"text":"I checked out Bubble for a happy hour meetup event.  It was a nice little spot for drinks.  The drinks are priced about average for a major city (I just moved from Orlando).  Huge wine list, but only bottles, very limited \"glass\" selection.    It's a nice atmosphere, but the GIANT old school barbie photos on the wall are a little out of place.  When I think \"bubble\" i think round, light, airy...i would change the artwork for some symmetrical shapes...maybe something abstract.   I see it as a great place to meet for happy hour with it's large booths and open floor plan.  Although I didn't tour the entire place, I'm not sure I would want to eat dinner in booths since the tables are knee height...although maybe they have more seating in the back.    moral: go for happy hour then move along"}
{"text":"The floor layout isn't very good and the music wasn't very diverse the night my friends and I went, but didn't have to pay to get in, got a decent table and met some friendly people. One bouncer was pretty rude, but our waitress was very sweet and the crowd was very diverse so that was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"Bubble is one of those places that my guy and I would pass up pretty much every time we would go uptown for drinks because we don't really \"do\" clubs, were much more the sit down and watch a game and share a bucket of beers type of couple. However, tonight was my guys bday and we had a rough day before that left a lot of our plans in ruins so we were wandering around trying to find somewhere to go that seemed new and exciting and since his first choice Sip decided to not let us in we came across Bubble and thought why not.    This place completely wowed me! I immediately regretted not having come so much sooner. They have a gorgeous interior and while I did regret not dressing up since I'm your tshirt and flip flops type you don't feel uncomfortable being there in plain clothes either, there was really a nice mixture of all walks of life and everyone was having the best time ever. The bartenders were super attentive and for it yes being a club and a busy one at that I never waited more than a few seconds for someone to come ask me what I would like to drink and everytime asking me if I wanted the same as last time. Its also spacious without being so big that if you lose one of your friends or whoever you came with you don't go into panic mode and start standing on chairs to try and find them. They have an amazing patio area that over looks college street that makes for great people watching while you sip your drink and theres also a large outdoor access to the bar as well so no need to fight to go back inside to get another round.   Bathrooms were super clean and they do have a bathroom attendant so have a couple extra bucks on you. Also theres parking in the parking deck for the epicenter.  There is a lot of stairs to climb from the first floor entrance so ladies with heels or if you need wheel chair access there is an elevator and a second floor entrance as well."}
{"text":"I do not recall our waiters name but he did excellent last night.  My husband and I celebrated our 6 year anniversary there. It was our first time there.  We had the shrimp cocktail and bow chicken appetizer. We enjoyed he'd our chef  choice calamari and steak dinner. I enjoyed the cotton candy drink while my husband enjoyed glasses of red wine! We finished the meal with the chocolate dessert as well as the other one listed.   The aesthetics of the place was surprisingly pleasant. The aesthetics of the plates and drinks were impressive!   The quality and  waste of everything was amazing!   We would definitely recommend this place and come back here. If you ever are in need of a quiet romantic place, come before 10pm. I honk dinner is served from 5-10"}
{"text":"Uptown is getting more and more over rated and inconsistent. I didn't even know Bubble had food!! You don't want to go before 11 and you must go after having had a few drinks. I will say that the staff is professional and courteous which can't be said about a lot of places in and out of uptown. I wish they drew in better DJ's. I keep hearing good things about Sunday brunch...TBC"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and a few friends. Had a good time. Place was spacious and clean. Drinks were a little pricy but overall had a good first time experience. Good for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for the grand opening. We were very disappointed.  There were no menus, which would have been fine if our waitress had a clue what she was talking about.  She was all over the place and had no clue what champagnes they had, what was by the glass, what was by the bottle and prices.  We would ask her question, she would go look and then come back with a different answer than what we asked.  She said a glass of Dom was $19 so I ordered that, then she comes back and has brought me a glass of Vueve that was $18 because she said she was wrong and the Dom was $40/glass.  She should have come and told me the price difference and asked what I wanted. Luckily I am fine with Vueve, but probably would have order Moet.  I understand first night kinks, but to me this was a horrible first impression.  I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Another club for 20 somethings in Charlotte.  If this place isn't that right now, I have a feeling that's what it will become.  That's not to say I'm not digging it.  It's the newest place to be right now and the views from outside on the balcony are some of the best you'll get uptown.  The bartenders are nice and friendly and the price of the drinks don't seem to excessive.  The clientele here is a little more upscale than normal so that's a good thing as well.  The music is upbeat and fun as well as the decor is nice and plush.  It would be a great spot to buy a VIP table otherwise I think it would get tiresome."}
{"text":"This is an upscale cocktail lounge club located in the epicenter. I have been here twice once for the club scene in another day for the winter cocktail spectacular.  The cocktail event was low-key in a pretty good deal for the price. I really enjoyed this event. The drinks were strong and they actually had me intrigued to return back to bubble from the cocktail experience. The appetizers were delicious I tried a few. The menu is limited, however they do have good food it appears from the apps. The restrooms are large and spacious. Both times that I went earlier in the evening they were clean. The waitstaff is composed of female waitresses that all have black hair tons of make up and wear push up bras I think they're going for the Kim Kardashian look. In order to be employees or to work here it appears you have to have this look. It just didn't seem original but too superficial or fake.  I get they gotta make their tips and this is what the clientele go for. The staff at the bar weren't friendly, but wanted you to beg come to them. I have a problem with this. The waitress was nice. A table or bottle service starts at 250.00 small table for two and 400.00 ish (up for for a large table area with bottle service as per the waitress. I'm from chicago and those are prices for a big city. I feel that they are really trying to hype this place up and keep it at a certain look and crowd here. I will come back for the cocktail events but I am not sure about the club scene."}
{"text":"Just posted a full review on the blog.  The highlights:  champagne and cocktails are outstanding, calamari was light and fresh.    Love the decor--it strikes a playful balance between sophisticated and fashionable, and the dining area is anything but standard with large round communal-style tables.    Pass on the flatbreads!"}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve and it had a great ambiance. Drinks were a little pricey but we're good and music was great! There was some dancing but there wasn't a very big area to dance. They also had several areas set up for bottle service. The patio/balcony was my favorite spot as Bubble is on the second floor and it overlooked uptown charlotte. They had the windows behind the bar that overlook the balcony open so it wasn't too warm inside but it was nice to have the option to go outside too. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"It's international night at Bubble! My friends and I arrived around 11pm, to find no one the dance floor. The party really picked up around 11:30-12ish. The Dj played a variety of music, EDU, reggaeton, pop, hip hop etc.   On a regular night, the crowd/music can be a hit or miss. Be sure to check out the party promoters/DJs before coming. I haven't had the opportunity to try the food or drinks (weird I know). During the summer I stopped in for the champagne special. I've heard the speciality cocktails are amazing!! This is definitely on my CLT bucket list. I LOVE the ambiance! The patio area offers the perfect backdrop for photos! My friends and I love this area during the summer. Bathrooms are always clean. Thankfully, the bouncers never hold the line.    I'm willing to give Bubble another shot. Maybe I'll stop in for dinner one day soon! Until next time folks..."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a kind-of soft opening that was meant to market Bubbles as an event space. First impression when walking in: looks like one of Tom Haverford's clubs from \"Parks and Rec.\" Slight turn to the right and... OMFG WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE GIANT PORTRAITS OF DOLLS ON THE WALL?!? Seriously mondo creepy. Ugh.   Anyway, the decor looks like it's trying wayyy too hard. Lots of gloss, no substance. My ideal lounge is trendy without trying to grab your attention like a high-priced escort who just lost their client for the evening.   We sat outside since it was happy hour and would be fun to people watch. I will give Bubbles this: it has a wonderful outdoor view of Trade and College. However, the servers were moving slower than molasses on this particular evening. They were nice, but not at all attentive. The tray-passed apps were ever so slowly served to some tables and not others.   One interesting aspect with a lot of potential is that the bar opens up to the patio; you can order a drink without going back inside. They did this for maybe three minutes, took a couple orders and then closed it back up again without any explanation. Mystifying. Overall, I'd say everything was very poorly managed.  We did get to sample some food: they have a caprese salad tower which looked cool, but the tomatoes were of poor quality and the mozzarella tasted ordinary at best. They also served a smoked salmon on potato chip appetizer, which was interesting but not worth repeating.  To summarize, this place is doing the exact opposite of what a good gastrolounge should do: rather than have a trendy, but not-trying-too-hard look with fast and attentive service, Bubbles goes for the attention-whore look with the zero-fucks-given servers. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give less than one star, I would certainly do so. In fact, I haven't written a yelp review in years and intentionally re-activated my account just to warn people of the horror that it this lounge/club.   My friends and I love to get dressed up and go out, and this is one of few clubs/dance spots that require attire more formal than flannel and shorts. On one night when we wanted an excuse to wear a nice dress we set out for Bubble, where the bouncers at the entrance treated us like we were entering an exclusive Vegas club in jeans. Fine, bouncers are not supposed to be friendly, right? The bartender took about 40 minutes to get us our drinks, which was slightly more offensive because any girl whose skirt didn't entirely cover her bum received much more efficient service. But also, to be expected so it was fine.  The end of the night when I was closing my tab, the bartender gave me my receipt but without the debit card. Again, paying no attention when I attempted to tell him this. Fed up, tired, and ready to leave I walked around the bar entrance to get his attention. Apparently I had gotten too close to the bartender, and at 5'3 and 125 lbs I must have been VERY threatening to him because he SHOVED me away from the bar! My reaction to being pushed, unfortunately (not proud of this part) was to push back, upon which 3 bouncers lifted me up and carried me out of the club.   Now, I'd like to point out that (1) I was sufficiently sober because I had only managed about 3-4 drinks in the 5 hours I was there due to the slow service. (2) When I attempted to explain that he pushed me, they not only were unconcerned but refused to go inside and give me my card so I had to cancel it that night.  Fast forward a few weeks I meet a bouncer for Bubble working at Alive After Five and told him my story. He apologized and gave me his number telling me to text him and he will ask his boss if perhaps we can have a bottle or some special treatment to make up for the event. Although I said I would never go back, I thought I would try again for a free bottle, why not?  I texted the bouncer asking about it a bit later and of course his response was rude, short, and he didn't seem to remember who he was speaking with. What did I expect??   I have lived in Vegas and LA, where celebrities frequent some of the most famous clubs in the US and have never ever received such rude treatment. Never again!!"}
{"text":"I come to Bubble fairly often for the night club. I like that it's dressier than almost everywhere else in CLT, but sometimes they still let girls in with denim shorts or guys with nice dark-wash jeans.   The crowd changes depending on the evening. Magnum Monday caters to the service industry crowd, and can be a pretty wild party sometimes. Thursdays are my favorite night to go out in general, and Bubble tends to have a pretty good crowd without being overly packed. Fridays and Saturdays can get really full and usually the tables are sold out most weekends. The crowd is diverse as far as age, background, and alcohol maturity.  The DJs are okay, I would prefer more edm/dance mix in the music. Wiggs&Wines are my favorite and they are frequently the choice for Mondays. Yona is there often and he has an okay mix of everything. Frenzy is good, too.  As for getting in the door, yes it can be a pain sometimes. The club is a bit small and honestly, it can get uncomfortably full. The waitresses are usually very friendly and attentive; I've had a bad experience but it was cleared up after-the-fact. Tori is really nice.   Great job for their marketing and events. I've walked in a few fashion shows there, as well as attended. I like that they cater to women. I've also seen a few local celebs in the club.   Overall, one of my preferred night clubs in CLT but there is room to improve."}
{"text":"The Chef is absolutely amazing! We had 4 guests. I ordered the Korean short ribs, my friends ordered the Mahi and a bean burger (she's vegetarian) the high light was the filet cooked at a perfect medium rare and served with truffle fries that were simply delectable! 5 stars for sure! We will be back! Thank you Chef Cox for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"First time here last October was solid (great food, nice atmosphere).  Went there tonight as a respite from a bar crawl, looking to inquire about bottle service. The young blonde girl at the front immediately said they were not open to the pub crawl until 10:00.  I tried to explain we would like to have appetizers and look into bottle service - not the pub crawl deal.  She would not even attempt to hear what our party of four (all multi- 6 figure income) were trying to do. Instead, she stated we could not come in until 10:00.  BTW, we were ready to celebrate and drop a lot of money.  Maybe not a good idea to have a a snarky $7 per hour person (just a guess) at the door directing traffic.  Lot of nice places in Charlotte that might appreciate our business."}
{"text":"This place is complete ASS. Can't wear white shoes? Can't wear jeans with rips? Miss me with that bullshit. Never coming here again. SHIT service"}
{"text":"We came here this weekend for the first time for my \"cousin-in-law's\" birthday.  We got bottle service and the server was nice and attentive.  However, the music was meh the majority of the night.  The crowd was fairly mixed as far as age goes.  I saw those that looked to be in their twenties to folks old enough to have grandchildren!  Here is why it gets one star:  My husband is Indian, therefore so is his cousin and everyone else in the party except for myself.  One of our friends (Indian) went to the DJ booth to request a song and birthday shout out.  The DJ informed her he didn't have a mic and couldn't play anything but house music.  Well, that explains the lackluster music.  However, just a bit later, the DJ had a mic and gave a birthday shout out to someone in the crowd!  What is that about?!?  So the birthday boy's wife (again, Indian) approached the DJ just a few minutes after that birthday announcement and requested one for her husband.  She was told the mic \"blew out\".  Hmmm.  Seemed a bit sketchy to me.  It seemed like racial discrimination to me, to be honest.  To give this place the benefit of the doubt, I, with my pale skin, went to the DJ booth to request a birthday shout out to my friend.  Sure enough, I was told by two people at the booth \"No problem!\".  Seriously?  I was dumbfounded, severely disappointed, and furious.  Guess I know why they wouldn't play the rap song we originally requested either...they don't want \"to attract the wrong crowd\"...I'll let you read between the lines on what I think they feel is the \"wrong crowd\".  This is unacceptable and I will tell everyone I know about this experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Bubble. I've heard some interesting things about the place and what goes on within the walls.  The visit was specifically for a featured event on Groupon, a whiskey tasting and cigar sampling titled \"Cigars and Stripes.\" I have opinions on that event which obviously I won't share here but I enjoyed my time at Bubble. It was an early evening event but ended just before s--t got cray.  During the event we decided to grab a table and try a few things off the menu. Specifically, I'm glad I stuck with my decision to pick the Bubble Burger. It was tasty. Someone else in my group chose the Beef and Toastini, he was definitely disappointed since it was listed as a sandwich but came out looking like a meat on crouton appetizer.  The staff seemed alert and friendly throughout the entire evening. The men's restroom was clean and in good repair with very nice hand towels. Hey, don't judge.  Just another option in the EpiCentre realm."}
{"text":"If they didn't smoke weed & cigarettes all night INSIDE the club this would b a good ass Monday night club spot !!! The managers don't listen to the customers when you have complaints or do anything about what your saying . Don't go if u have asthma you'll b in the hospital"}
{"text":"RIP to Bubble.   Magnum Mondays were always the best. The patio was one of the best people watching spots.   Curious to see what happens to this space now. Thanks for a lot of blurry (but fun) nights."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to Bubble my experience has been awesome. The dj and booths are top notch! Decor is very chic and the crowd is always filled with the young, trendy, and gorgeous people of Charlotte. I love the little patio where you can escape the music and dancing for a breather but still have access to the bar! Very clever! If you are looking for a club to dance out and look at hotties, this is your spot!  Also Magnum Mondays are the most fun you can have on a Monday night! Mostly service industry peeps that are well behaved. Go and have fun!"}
{"text":"I went to bubble because it was recomended by the sushi place in the center. The crowd is very young. They have very large creepy pictures of Barbie in the wall. Here is my assessment of my two hour visit to this establishment.  Cons- the crowd is young. I heard four Miley Cyrus songs in one hour. I could not get a drink in this place to save my life. Total wait time at the bar was around 20 to 30 minutes. A strong drink would have been needed to drown out the teenies yelling \"omg\".  The bathrooms were a mess. And the bartenders not friendly.   I did like the security guards and the way the place looked minus the Barbie pictures. There was  a fight probably due to the fist pumping and the guards did a great job handling it while making sure no on else got hurt."}
{"text":"Tried bubble tonight! We had the best time, very cool spot. We love the decor especially the giant round booths.  Great creative drink selection! We had the orange crush and French Cosmo both were superb.  Service was very good, very attentive.  For dinner we pick three winners,  first the calamari-very good Second fresh strawberry chèvre - excellent Third champagne poached shrimp- amazing!   Bubble is a must try spot when your in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Pretty swanky spot to get together for a birthday to start the night.  Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had some drinks and apps before getting the party started.  The appetizers came out incredibly slow, but they were all tasty.  I highly recommend prosciutto & cantaloupe combo, it was really good.  The server was attentive, other than the fact that drinks came a bit slow.  She did her best and accommodated us by getting a candle to put on a dessert for the birthday girl.  Good times!  I am willing to come here again!  dmo out."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love Bubble! This is our go-to place in the EpiCentre. We were hoping Charlotte would get a more upscale lounge that mimics that of one in Vegas or Miami, and this is about as close as it gets for Charlotte. It's refreshing to go to a place where you can dress up and have delicious, unique cocktails. *My favorite is the Marilyn Monroe (made with cotton candy). The champagne selection is the best in the city (by the bottle or some by the glass). The view of the city is so pretty at night on their balcony, or you can dance the night away inside. I've only had bottle service once here and it was well worth it to have a place to come back to and sit. If you check it out, make sure you visit our favorite bartender, Casey, who is usually in the corner by the balcony door."}
{"text":"While I didn't come here for dinner, I'm giving 4 stars for the experience I had.  I came in around 9:30 on a Saturday night- not looking to club, but just to relax and enjoy the city. I came in wanting to try the Marilyn Monroe. They ran out of cotton candy though so I didn't want it as much lol. Instead we asked the bartender for a fruity drink and we got two for $14- not bad!   We took the drinks out to the balcony outside. Luckily there was an open table for us! We got a great view of the city and sat there for about an hour. It started getting not as enjoyable as more people arrived and crowded around the balcony. I only wish it was more spacious!   If you want a relaxing, non-ratchet night, come grab a drink, take it outside and enjoy Charlotte at night."}
{"text":"All day on their facebook page they were posting, \"come to Bubble after alive after 5 for $1 champagne\" - myself and several friends planned on hitting the place up on the evening of Thursday August 1st.  We got there about 9:45, about 15 minutes before alive after 5 ends, and were told that they ran out of the $1 champagne.  Bartender was pretty bitchy about me just asking for a special.  She recommended one of the $11 glasses of champagne, my friends and I balked, left without buying anything.  Place looked tacky too, I would not return."}
{"text":"My brother and I came on this particular day for a day party on MLK weekends. one thing I love about Bubble is you can always count on a good day party from them. They serve food as well so its a restaurant between certain hours. The wings I know for a fact are good  I mean really good kind of pricey but worth it. the drinks are really good as well Kind of pricy but worth it as well. The day parties during CIAA are always lit and I cant wait to go this upcoming CIAA."}
{"text":"Bubble is a bar/restaurant located in the epicentre on the first level. The decor is amazing! The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Not really a fan of the food they have the expensive flavorless small portion food options. Ordered the Marilyn Monroe it was $11 and tasted like straight water! The presentation of the drink was nice but it wasn't worth it. Probably won't be back. However if you like this type of food and drinks then hey go for it! I would at least check it out if you've never been. Only giving it three stars because of the decor. I posted a video and picture."}
{"text":"So me and several of my friends came here for Queens Feast aka Charlotte restaurant week. We had a 5 o clock reservation because every other restaurant we tried was booked for almost all other times. A hassle but we were happy to have any reservation at all.   Upon arrival things were very nice: our table was set, the atmosphere was pretty nice and we were promptly helped by the staff. So far so good.   The restaurant week specials I tried were as follows: Kettle Chips, 8 oz Filet, and vanilla creme brûlée. The chips were an okay choice and the dip was good not great for me. Not my personal favorite but after giving it a try, some of my table mates told me I was the appetizer winner with my choice. Hunter: 1, Friends: 0.   The scoreboard quickly changed upon the entree though. I am not one to usually even be able to tell how my steak is cooked but even I realized that my medium steak seemed overcooked. My friends who also ordered medium concurred. The medium rare group seemed okay though. But beyond the cooking level the taste was not very good and I do not think the cooking level would've changed that. The entree was unfortunately the weakest part of the meal.   My creme brûlée was good not great, with the sugary surface being a bit too hard. Still pretty good though.   As for service, I will say that we were there for 1.75 hours and I felt no real pressure to leave which was a nice feeling. But then again it was also almost empty at this point. A big negative though was one of my friends ordering medium rare and being given a medium. Usually not a big deal but with the medium actually being code for well done this was a significant error.   Now, something worth noting is that this was a champagne bar and we were having dinner so I bet our experience would've been different had we been going here as a nightlife destination. But overall, Bubble was our last choice for Restaurant Week and the meal really made it feel like a last choice. I do not too often get into Charlotte but this place will be not be on my short list for dinner. Perhaps if I am going out I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance.. but 0 for service. (yes yes, I know that averages to 2.5, but I'm rounding to 3 because I'm optimistic!) I was so excited when I heard that our building was hosting a Happy Hour at this new spot! I walked in, and instantly loved the decor! they've done a terrific job creating a chic lounge. Sadly, my excitement was very quickly destroyed, thanks to their service... or lack thereof. Champagne is Champagne, whether you drink it at a classy bar or in your patio! When people decide to go to a bar and spend money on an overpriced glass of alcohol, it's not because it tastes better at a bar, we're essentially paying for the service and experience. Perhaps the poor service can be attested to some growing pains? I'm hopeful that if I go back there, I'll have a better experience, because this type of a bar/lounge could be a splendid addition to uptown!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Eric was the best! He made my birthday weekend fun! Would definitely go back again! Restaurant week was great!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to Bubble a couple of times now, and I have to say that it's definitely where I choose to go when I'm at the Epicenter.  I'm a little older than I was in my best rug cuttin' days, so Suite and Whiskey River aren't quite as amazing as they used to be to me.    Bubble has an upscale feel to it, but the crowd is definitely a nice blend of good people to be in the company of.  During my last Bubble adventure, we decided to go with a bottle service table in the VIP area, based on the recommendation of a friend.  Excellent call!  Our service was amazing, and we never had to worry about an empty glass.  I wish I could tell you how the music was, but it wasn't a big part of the evening for us.  I guess that means that it wasn't horrible, but not memorable either.    Now, Bubble is known for their Champagne selection, but after one glass of Champagne, I'm typically ready for something a bit more....manly?  The liquor selection at Bubble certainly didn't disappoint.  The bartenders and wait staff were all friendly, and attentive for the entire evening, even as the it got later, and bar became more crowded.  I will offer this advice though...if your a guy and you're wearing your visor, or flip flops, you may want to check out another venue.  When we arrived, I noticed a group of guys with flip flops on who weren't able to get in.  At a spot like Bubble, what people wear is part of the experience and decor of the place, so I guess I understand the dress code.  Then again, it's still Charlotte  :)  I was pleasantly surprised by the great time that I had at Bubble, and will definitely stop back in next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Was ok, bought a groupon for a champagne fest. I really thought this was the type of place you go for champagne and caviar but I dont think so. The even was mad and so packed one could harly move but still it was fine. We had a good time and learned quick if you wanted something to eat, stand by the door. I also had a yelp promotion they were not going tohonor but gave us two glasses of champagne instead. It was really tasty. Thanks. I would limit the amount of tickets sold"}
{"text":"The nice folks at Bubble Lounge contacted my Meetup group and offered each guest a free glass of champagne plus complimentary appetizers.  The lounge was opulently decorated; my favorite touch was the giant Barbie close ups lining the wall.   The champagne is good, and, if you pay a $5.00 donation, you get $1.00 champagne refills all night long!  The donation goes to fight human trafficking.  The appetizers provided for us included a blue cheese dip, a margherita pizza, vegetable tempura sticks with yum yum sauce and hummus with pita chips.  Yum Yum sauce tastes like a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise, with a secret ingredient.  Nothing disappointed, plus, it was all vegetarian fare, which is a plus with me!  Omnivores, please note that the menu is not vegetarian, and you will find something meaty to bite with your pointy little teeth.   The staff at Bubble is friendly.  Our server was gracious and attentive.   The only thing that I didn't like about Bubble Lounge is that it is located at The Epicenter.  Parking is expensive and maneuvering around is confusing.  Still, I would like to return."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place but I am going to go with 4 stars simply based on the atmosphere and the beautiful décor, inventive drink menu and attempt to be a super posh spot in the QC.  Being from Charlotte I always find it a little comical when there are VIP tables at a lounge where you are being served by the likes of someone that stepped out of the playboy mansion.  I'm not being a hater...I just find it slightly funny.    All that to say...I think Bubble has done a good job of portraying a sleek and trendy atmosphere that will hopefully continue to appeal to a more mature crowd and will be able to maintain its prestige.  The location may make that difficult but we'll see.    Everyone was VERY nice and one of the managers checked on us a couple times.  I also thought it was classy that they let us know about an hour in advance that we would be getting kicked out of our table because it was reserved for VIP.  They were nice about it and I appreciate what they are trying to do.  I wish them well.  I didn't try the food but the drink I ordered (some type of peach champagne concoction) was very good.  I wasn't sure what to expect from Bubble so I am glad that I checked it out.  I think they are a good replacement to Mez--they seem similar in some ways.  Am I going to frequent Bubble, no.  But I think they have what it takes to be successful here in Charlotte.    ***I also saw Ric Flair while there so that was fun!  Check them out if this is your kind of scene!"}
{"text":"I visited Bubble for a Champagne tasting and was pretty impressed with the options. We received four tickets and could visit each Champagne Table, using each ticket, to enjoy a glass. The atmosphere is pretty trendy and service was nice.  As the night went on the crowd got a little more rowdy/obnoxious, and loud, to the point we couldn't hear ourselves think. We did enjoy the outside patio before heading out."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time.  First of all there is not a bottle of Champagne (their entire concept) under $100.  Apparently they are catering to NFL  Players....not Epicentre visitors.  The environment is fine....but the food is completely un-inventful.  Calamari?  Really.  Caprese Salad.  Really?  I will say that the food I got was fine.  The wasabi sauce with the calamari was really good.  I was just unimpressed.  I don't think the Epicentre needs another Suite."}
{"text":"Dropped in during the week, on our way to a concert, so only a few people at bar.The food, flavor, atmosphere was very pleasing, much to be desired, presentation of the food was Excellent. Not a huge menu, but offering tasty entrees. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. Martini's were on point!!! The shop was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility. My husband and I loved this place Im sure everything is a must try! The small plates were Delicious.   PS: The south is known for being friendly, the staff that brought us our food didnt seem to thrilled to be at work, he just put our food down and walked away, kinda odd...I woulda given a 4 rating if it wasnt for this incident. The place again was almost empty, not a club night going on this particular night."}
{"text":"Bubble is one of the hottest clubs in the QC. They have friendly staff and great bartenders. The Bubble girls are all beautiful and make sure you are well taken care when you have a table or bottle service.   I also went to a Cakebread Vineyards dinner and wine pairing there. It was exquisite.  I highly recommend visiting Bubble. You're guaranteed to have an amazing night out!"}
{"text":"I see why ppl don't care for this place too much. We had a reservation and it took forever to get our first round of drinks. They also have many pics of their specialty drinks with cotton candy, but they didn't have the ingredients they needed to make any of them. We were disappointed as we were expecting more."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town.  We went to Bubble on Wed night 2/11 after going to 3 other locations who had over an hour wait.  We ended up at Bubble as kind of a last resort as it was cold outside.  The place was empty and I thought about leaving even after sitting at the table because it must not be good since it was empty.  Wow, were we in for a great surprise.  I was dining with a co-worker and we ordered 3 apps to share and salads for dinner.  The food and the presentation was amazing.  The cold asparagus had me very skeptical as I was expecting it warm, I have not stopped talking about it.  The calamari was very tasty, the truffle fries delicious and our salad perfection.  We even had a visit from the chef and told him just what we thought.  I visit Charlotte often and I cannot wait to go back.  Highly recommend."}
