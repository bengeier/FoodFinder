{"text":"Ate the Thursday special,  Philly cheese Steak and it was good.  Really liked the entertainment by Chuck DeFloria.  He had several musicians join him. It was fun!"}
{"text":"Friendly place with great food and music.Great rock on Friday and Saturday nights too."}
{"text":"I had an issue with my order and talked to the manager.  She was rude and inconsiderate.  I will not be going back there again.  My suggestion to you would be not to experience what I experienced.  But if you are a glutton for punishment, be my guest."}

{"text":"Come here for rude staff and wannabe bikers. After a spring training game my group of 5 came to Kimmyz on Greenway. We were met with hostility from a fanny pack wearing, ponytail sporting loser and a nasty attitude from the bar tender. Our age group was 27-38 and the bar tender only wanted to see our hispanic friends ID, he is 33. We ordered our beers and the bartender decided to not serve our hispanic friend because she believed him to be intoxicated and served him a water instead, although we had one beer each at the spring training game more then 2 hours earlier. After he was singled out and stated our case we split from that crappy mullet, fanny pack wearing, 80s hair metal bar and decided to spend our hard earned $ at Tonys Bar in the same plaza where we spent the rest of the evening and had a great time"}
{"text":"This place has great food, staff is awesome, owner kimmy is friendly and very inviting. My children love eating here! The menu is big and very reasonably priced. We come from Prescott to eat here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars to go to and listen to live music, food, and a nice cold one.  The people are all friendly there and my experiences have always been positive.  Great time and very nice neighborhood bar to relax. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery thru door dash and while expecting a delivery charge door dash is hurting Kimmyz by charging an ADDITIONAL 30% of your order which considerably raises the bill, actually between delivery fee and the 30% additional charge total has reached double the actual food amount. Wondering if Kimmyz is aware. In my opinion while the delivery option is obviously great, the additional fees make it unrealistic and unreasonable.  Getting some of the BEST  chicken sandwiches etc in town still just can't make a 25.00 total fee worth it. Very damaging to Kimmyz"}
{"text":"Came back in with a couple friends to give this spot another try, mainly because the owner kimmy took the time to respond to my previous review. Very enjoyable experience the second time around, much more laid back. My whole group had a good time, and because of the close proximity to my house I'll most likely become more of a regular. Also, staff has been fantastic on both visits, much friendlier than the other bar in the same complex (can't seem to remember the name). Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We went to a paintnite there and it's a perfect place for this event. Plenty of good seats and service was excellent. We really enjoyed ourselves. I really hope they have more paintnite. Next time we want to try their food."}
{"text":"My parents and I found this bar when I was looking for live music in the area.  It was one of the best nights I have had in a long time!  The band was awesome (Blackhorse).  It felt like we were at a concert with dancing and tons of fun people.  My dad ordered one of their burgers and he said it was delicious!  The owner, Kimmy was there the night we went and welcomed us after finding out it was our first time there.  The bartenders and servers were friendly and personable.  I have lived in AZ for a little over a year now and this is by far the best bar I have found.  Great atmosphere, excellent service and awesome live music.  I will be coming back, that's for sure!!!"}
{"text":"A needed venue on the West Side... Owner very guest oriented... She gets it.... Great fans great prices great crowds place is very clean also she does not spare on the talent the bands that are there are known and very good not to mention my favorite night of the week Monday and meatloaf which is awesome for $7.95.... Again the service is a bit crazy on Fridays and Saturday nights for what you can you expect when its wall to wall people.. Anybody who complains about it is a total idiot.... I look forward to Fridays and Saturdays in finding out who's playing"}
{"text":"Karaoke is always fun older crowd all sing lol pool in back patio in front didn't order food but a good time very mellow no drams"}
{"text":"Great place!  My wife had dinner and beers on Friday night. We were there before the band started so we got a table. The staff was attentive and made sure we had a great experience. I had the philly cheese steak with tater tots. It was hot off the grill and delicious. My wife had the Friday night fish fry, again delicious. This is a great place to eat and have a good time"}
{"text":"watched the Superbowl there and had several order of their wings. The food was really great! Cant wait to go back and try more items off the menu.  The bartender was really good too. She kept checking on us to see if needed anything."}
{"text":"Great nightclub/restaurant on the west side... They have great bands on Friday & Saturday nights, excellent food, and extremely friendly owner & staff. Clean place, cool atmosphere, relaxed without pretension."}
{"text":"We come for the live music not for the food.  They have great live music on the weekends and the service is great.  The foods pretty much typical bar food but it's not bad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Divey kind of bar. Good pours in the drinks. Good prices. Decent atmosphere. Overall, pretty decent place."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night here and the despite four motorcycles parked outside, we still decided to venture into this madhouse for a beverage. Ran into the usual sterotypes inside this local bar including the stumbling, old grey-haired biker with a ponytail and bandanna securely on head. Nobody looked out of control yet since it was only 10pm and the band was just an average cover band, who did not do a good version of 9675309. All tables and seats were full, so we enjoyed our brews standing in a tight spot near the swinging kitchen door. Probably unless you live closeby, you will likely never find yourself here and you will still sleep well at night. Also the TV sets look like they were leftover from the 80's."}
{"text":"Staff nice and helpful but food was not great. I had $12 smothered 3 cheese chicken with mixed veggies and baked potato. Chicken dry with one piece of processed American cheese melted on it, microwaved \"baked\" potato, microwaved broccoli and nearly raw carrots and cold dinner roll. I actually had to send the plate back to be microwaved more because it was cold when it came to the table. Not worth going back or recommending the food. I hope management reads reviews. On a good note...I have tried the fish n fries on a prior  occasion and they were fantastic! I was really hoping to get them again but was sorely disappointed to find out fish is only served on Fridays. Perhaps if fish was permanently on the menu, this poor review of the smothered chicken would have never occured. I'm still wondering how one slice of American cheese equates to smothered 3 cheese chicken."}
{"text":"First things first...DOUBLE my stars. This place gets a 10/10. I go there very often, it's close to my house, and I know people that go there often as well. Live bands all the time. The food is AMAZING, I'll go there just to eat. The drinks are great, the price is great. As for the staff and bartenders...I love em all! Everyone gets along with everyone. It gets busy on the weekends, I highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Service was great.....Friday night all you can eat fish is superb, perfect french fries. Actually, I have tried everything on their menu...not one complaint. Have to try this establishment. ...you will not be disappointed.  Their live music is great too. Get there early because seating goes fast!"}
{"text":"Kick ass bar. Kick ass staff (and very easy on the eyes). Great drink specials, delicious food, sick bands and so many events! Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great bar that has suprsingly good food. Advise to try the burger. Mostly known in my circle for the live bands, it's a destination place for the biker crowd. But don't let that scare you away, we don't bit!"}
{"text":"Okay ! Kimmys is one of the best biker friendly bars on the Westside. Cold beer  food and rock-n-roll. I recommend it. Now, how can I say this nicely ? Music to loud and over modulated, yes, can't believe I said that. I know I'm getting old but, it would be nice to hear the words of the song once in the while ? Remember kimmys is on 59th Ave. and greenway ..."}
{"text":"Biker douche bag heaven! OMG. Won't be eating there again. Terrible clientele. Even worse music. There happened to be a one man band playing the night I was there. Terrible terrible terrible! Unless you're out for blaringly loud Sweet home Alabama and other super shitty 70's freedom rock. I'd highly suggest you stay away. I will say that the food was ok. Had fried chicken sliders and fries. Nothing phenomenal. Basically bar food that you can get ANYWHERE."}
{"text":"Great place to watch NFL games. A ton of tvs. Typical bar food (fried, fried, and more fried). Not a great selection of draft beers, but the drinks are cheap.  Two pool tables get a fair amount of action.  If you like classic/hard/butt rock, you're in luck on the weekends.  Typical clientele looks more dicey than they really are, though I probably wouldn't go here on a first date.  You won't be shunned if you don't drive a motorcycle, have tons of tattoos, or have a handlebar mustache, but if you do, you'll be able to blend in easily.  Cute waitresses and bartenders are a plus."}
{"text":"The staff here is friendly and helpful.  Food is good and live music adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"1st time = great time! Had a Reuben, was great  Band was cool, played some great jams Theresa (our server) was absolutely fantastic! Shall return, at least a lot."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've had the same issue with rude bartenders. It took me forever to get a drink. I told the lady next to me I was waiting 15 mins then the bartender yelled at me \"We've been watching you, you haven't been waiting here 15 minutes!\" Then I got charged for a large draft beer I never even ordered. I don't like the large drafts because they get warm and taste bad. When I got my tab and told the bartender I didn't order that she said \"Yes you did!\" and ripped the bill out from under me. This could be the last bar in the world and I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food is great, they get it right every time. Kayla is the best in the business, she is smart, professional,gorgeous and knows our order by heart. We are in every Weds. Sometimes on Mondays as well. It's a fun place that has lots of regulars at the bar. Kayla makes it happen."}
{"text":"A biker bar if you are into that. They have a really small patio and the service is slow. Not a bad place just a different crowd."}
{"text":"We ALWAYS have a great time here!  The staff is very friendly, the place is casual but lively, and the music on the weekends has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great burger today. I ordered med rare but got medium. Still a good 1/2lb cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"I have been to this fantastic little bar several times. I always bring out of town friends there. The best bands, the crowd are great BUT if you are not a regular or not a man, good luck getting service!! Every time I go, without fail the service is awful! The cocktail server will pass by and never give you the time of day. I've wanted to try the food but haven't been offered a menu so I just stand at the bar long enough to get my drink and go sit down. I still go because the overall atmosphere is worth it and I keep hoping it will be better next time..."}
{"text":"Cool bar in a shopping center. So happy I stopped on the check it out. Tatum behind the bar is friendly and inviting. The ambiance is dive bar tres chic. Looks like there is a little stage for live music. 14 or so drafts (including some craft options). Normal bar food available. Drink prices were reasonable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch in the middle of the week, so pretty low-key as crowds go. Had four entrees, food was good and especially enjoyed the fries. Hung around for a couple of drinks and several games of pool. Waitress was attentive, music good. Smoking on the patio, but unfortunately is sucked indoors with every opening of the door. Clean, comfortable for a couple of forty-somethings with grown kids along."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar!!!  The staff is amazing!  Theresa and Kayla are the best waitresses in all of AZ and the food is really good too.  The best thing is the live music and Kimmy makes sure she books the best bands for dancing and listening to.  This is the most comfortable place for a person to hang out and feel welcome."}
{"text":"Love to come here. Great live music and not to expensive. Hard to find an awesome biker bar in town.  The food isn't too bad either. I've had breakfast here and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Kimmyz is definitely the best sports bar in Glendale the bartender and waitress kayla is bar none the best person around and takes care of you 100% of the time their food is the best bar food I have ever eaten if you have never been there it's worth the trip to Go"}
{"text":"When I pay money why would I go to a place where it feels the servers don't want to be there? I attended one of their open mics and it was the only saving grace, although it wasn't original music. If I wanted to hear the songs that were being played I would have gone home and cranked them up. I like to listen to raw, untalented, music that jams whatever the genre. All in all the people were awesome to talk to. Lots of kick ass regulars. Prices were the same as any other place. Atmosphere was inviting. I might go back there again."}
{"text":"We found this place simply by accident and are very impressed. We just wanted something to eat after getting into Arizona and had great service and our burgers were fantastic. We decided that we would go back again the next night because we liked it so much. The waitress, Julia remembered our previous orders to a t and was excellent yet again. The food was great but Julia was by far one of the best waitresses we have ever had. The live band was great too."}
{"text":"You'll enjoy this place if you're old and love shitty, loud, rock cover bands.  Otherwise I'd chose anywhere else on the planet."}
{"text":"Super cool bar!! Food is not your typical bar food. I ordered a medium rare burger with cottage cheese and it came out perfect!! My friend ordered a Cali burger with tots and he enjoyed it!! Staff was very helpful - we came in during shift change but Carrie took care of us. Live band on a Tuesday night - daily specials too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the few places left that actually have live music. The food is good, the waitstaff is great, and the people watching is amusing. The worst thing about our night out was the band. Sunset Strip, I believe they are called. The female singer can't hit the notes and was flat all night. The drummer can't keep a steady tempo and was sloppy and all over the place. They play everything too fast. I will go back when they have a different band."}
{"text":"Went few days ago and the blonde bartender, I think Andrea was so rude! She had a bad attitude, she was bullying everyone and soo disrespectful! I will not be back, nobody will talk down on me like this"}
{"text":"Kimmyz on Greenway is my favorite bar in AZ! The staff is amazing and they are all so welcoming.. especially Bridgette! Every time I walk in, she knows exactly what I want, whether it's a crown apple & cran or a Dr. Pepper  every Tuesday they have open mic, that is my favorite night of the week! They bring in such a loving crowd. And don't let me forget the fantastic food!!! Mmmmm taco Tuesday  I love you Kimmyz and all of the staff there  my second family."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go! GREAT STAFF! Theresa is the BEST server in Az.. hands down! Kimmy is the sweetest and knows how to run a great bar/restaurant.  Awesome food, great music, good drinks & the fantastic service. A++++++"}
{"text":"Came in for I thought would be a quick lunch... Unfortunately there is only one person working at the moment. Food was decent for taco Tuesday. But the wait was ridiculous! Waited for more than 10 minutes for my check. NOT THE SERVERS fault! Need more front of house not just one. Local beer was good and I would try it again. I'll come back for a dinner one day."}
{"text":"The best place with the best people and best waitresses (love Theresa)  Food is always incredible and I come here even though I don't hardly ever drink alcohol because I love the atmosphere and the way your treated when here.. Oh yeah, did I mention that the food is great - real food, not processed  Highly recommend highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like great food and awesome service then this is the spot. Kimmyz has many options on tap and their food is the perfect bar fare. Every time I go in this place I get a great vibe and meet some interesting people. The owner (Kimmy) can sometimes be seen pouring beers and talking with the patrons. This business has been around for a long time because they take care of their customers. I highly recommend Kimmyz for anyone one looking for a new place to hang out and have fun!!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar.  Went to watch football on Sunday and had a good time.  Beers were ice cold and not expensive."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with reasonable prices, good service. Nice laid back atmosphere. Friendly patrons encountered every time we've been. Have yet to experience live music but seems like it should be on our agenda soon. Have only been here for beers and have yet to try the food. Daily deals on different entrees and the portions look generous."}
{"text":"It's just a big man cave. Shut your trap and chug some $3, 25 oz. drafts while you spend your Sunday watching the game. The selection ain't fancy, but the seating is nice. When I watch my team kick some ass, I need nothing more than a mug and some elbow room.  If you need to light up, there's a little patio by the front. This place is chill."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy watching sports and enjoying a cold one. Kimmy has a great crew of friendly staff. Their menu is full yummy stuff! Our favorite is Carrie who works Saturday and Sunday days along with Monday and Tuesday nights. They often have live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great live music, open mic night Tuesdays, pool tables, trivia, and more!  Kimmy does a lot of fund raisers for the community as well as frequent fun, special events. They also have some of the best waitstaff/servers around (especially the irreplaceable Theresa).  Check it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The management of this establishment was rude unorganized for as many parties that they had for a Saturday evening. They should not have all the tables reserved for locals to come in to enjoy the band and the birthday people! they also should have more than just a couple servers for the evening which all the parties can be taken care of in a proper manner! I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years I own my own business I'm on my second business now. It in all my years I have never came across disorganized dysfunctional events ever! I have been accommodated for their mistakes. This is told for the owner Kimmy so she could figure out a new way to accommodate all her customers that into the establishment. And the reservation policy should be changed! We were not the only ones they had an issue with this situation"}
{"text":"Great place with a unique atmosphere! Met the owners and they were awesome. The place is tidy, relaxing and decorated like a sports bar. Would come definitely next time! They have great specials and good selection of beer. Needless to say the service was incredible! In addition, they have excellent air conditioning which is a huge plus! A+"}
{"text":"If you're in the neighborhood or just driving by this is definitely a spot to check out. The staff is super duper friendly honestly they've all been here for 3 years or more which says a lot about the owner I've yet to meet the owner but you obviously know she is good at managing her employees because the bartender has been here for at least 5 years! Super Fun environment huge TVs everywhere you look there's not a seat in the house that you can't see a game! And the food honestly is something to come back for it if you're in the mood for great wings!"}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood bar. Not my cup of tea- but seemed to the perfect place for the guy that just wants to watch the game -and not be distracted by any courtship rituals...There was a small percentage of women there- but looked like that is what they were there for too."}
