{"text":"Awesome mom and pop type place. Great sandwiches and specials.. can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"Fries were good (although I think they were superfries), I tried the 'yin yang' burger - chicken and beef in total harmony - it was not as harmonious as described, but not bad. It tasted interesting, but not great. The bun was huge, and the Jones pop I got was like a cup of sugar. I guess I should have stuck with water. I think the menu and place could use a stricter identity - southern fried chicken with asian spices doesn't sound southern. The decor and the items on them menu seemed to clash making this a baffling place to me at times. I may try again though."}
{"text":"Great Reuben special!  I was here ON Tuesday because I needed a snack in the area and this was my only option. Very much A little hole in the wall deli, but super friendly owners and a great Reuben sandwich with potato salad."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I frequent for lunch or breakfast in the area, it's close to work and I know the people who run it. They are kind, appreciative people and I do enjoy the food.  They cycle through different specials which can also be a little bit inconsistant but the sandwiches and salads are always great and I always get impeccable service. Highly recommend this place for a quick bite for take out, too small to really accomodate much sit in guests but I always grab something to go."}
{"text":"cute mom and pop place, good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The couple that runs this place are so nice, caring and thankful for your business. Their best menu item is the Jerk Chicken, which comes up as a special often!"}
