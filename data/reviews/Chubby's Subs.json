{"text":"Sub's are delicious, great local sub joint. Definitely will come back more then a few times"}
{"text":"Good quality food, I still like other sub places better, but this is above average quality and fast service."}
{"text":"This was a great alternative to subway. It was a good sub, the bacon was really flavourful compared to your typical chain sub shops. If I'm ever in the neighbourhood again I would for sure go there rather than subway across the street."}
{"text":"I try and go here as much as possible.... absolutely love the subs. Amazing value for the price... the subway across the street will definitely go out of business! Lots of space inside for eat-in (these taste great when fresh). Very clean, 5 star service, 5 star food. 

P.s. try the turkey sub with tatziki sauce and some mayo! Theee bomb!!"}
{"text":"I read a few reviews on this site and thought I should check this place out.

I checked this place out on a Tuesday - it is a blast from the past and within a couple of minutes I was really impressed!

The gentleman behind the cash greeted me genuinely and explained everything about the store, introduced me to the owner, explained how everything is cooked (they have Jerk Chicken marinated for a week and it's only sold on Thursdays) and everything about their specials - it was an education!

The food here is fresh. I ordered a chicken souvlaki sub and I didn't regret it. I love how their lettuce is thin, items are fresh and there is an abundance of sauces; they have confidence in their menu; on top of this, their prices are very reasonable for what you are getting.

If I had to be really picky I would say that for how everything is run and handled (very professional and sensible) I would make a recommendation to find another way to heat the amazing grilled chicken other than a microwave. THIS IS BEING REALLY PICKY.

Always impressed to find great places like this, with excellent quality food, great people and awesome prices!

You have to check this place out... it's the real deal!"}
{"text":"OK place, very American.. Bacon was microwaved for the sandwich...
OK food and nice waiter .."}
{"text":"Chubby's Subs is an old-school submarine shop located in East Scarborough, tucked away in the corner of a plaza.

The decor is nostalgic and they have photo's of their vintage menu's from decades ago. The shop was originally a Mr.Sub, however they decided to keep the ovens for Chubby's operations. I like this. I feel like seeing the Mr.Sub bread ovens connotes meaning. It has a story.

I came in on a late Tuesday evening for their chicken club sub of the day ($6.75 after tax).

It came with real grilled chicken breast, bacon, turkey and toppings. I like that Chubby's uses thinly sliced lettuce and tomatoes (old-school style). A big plus is they have tzatiki as a sauce! 

The 2 gentlemen running this establishment are friendly, and passionate in the subs they make. The owner apparently marinates his jerk chicken for 7 days, and it sells out quick! 

Great value, tasty subs, and they even toast the sandwich which gives it a nice crispy texture.

-1 star for microwaving the meat, but everything else is awesome!"}
{"text":"I frequently enjoy lunch at this nice corner restaurant. This is where I come and have my veggan fix with a nice veggy sub. I actually crave the food here. They have a great variety of sandwiches and subs all the way up to meatballs. The service is good. The price is excellent . There is free WiFi. Just ask for the password. And you can sit in the back which is glass and provides you with a nice and bright  view outside."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for the turkey/bacon sub and I'm never disappointed. This place is the place to go to if you want a really good sub that's seriously tasty and always super fresh.  Even if there is a line at the door,  it's 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best subs in the GTA!  I'm glad this place is close to home. 
They have daily specials for $5 & $6. He makes his own chicken breast, it's not the processed crap. 
The owner is a super friendly guy. 
Check their website for what the specials are every day."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for letting me know of this hidden place for subs. 

True to the ratings, Chubby's did not disappoint!

Got the Monday footlong BLT special, grilled on the press. Half for lunch and half for later.

I must agree, Chubby's builds a wicked sub. Generous with the toppings. 
The second half of the sub tasted just as good 4 hrs later. Wasn't soggy at all.

Tried their potato & leek soup. Not so great. I'll stick with just their subs."}
{"text":"I would have to say one of the best subs I've had in Scarborough. Being a food blogger and a personal chef..I do eat a lot of food and know what quality is. 
Wayyy better than Subway, and I'm not just saying that. Once you try it, you will agree with me, and it's also cheaper"}
{"text":"Up in Pickering for work and driving back down the 401 to Buffalo.

Great sandwiches plain and simple. Service was excellent. Chicken they roast right there.

Very full after I ate the footling packed high with all the toppings.

Only knock would be that they heat the chicken back up in the microwave which then dries it out a bit. Not sure anything can be done about reheat method though."}
{"text":"This place uses the freshest ingredients. I love how the veggies are so finely sliced, especially the thinly shredded lettuce. No more tomatoes ends. This place is generous with their deli meats. You'd never have to say 'could you put a little more of that'. The bacon strips are real. Not your usual ready-crisp microwavable pathetic excuse for bacon. This place will make you think twice about the regular chain sub places.They have plenty of different sauces available,  which includes tzaziki :) Not to mention, the subs are toasted on a panini/sandwich  press-grill. This place has been renovated as well. Really nostalgic looking. The owners have a long history in the GTA, going as far back as the early 70's. This location was previously a run down Mr. Sub."}
{"text":"Just started coming here about a month ago after reading all of the great reviews and I must say, it's great! Prices are unbeatable and every sub I've had is fresh. I recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat close to home and this sub shop had very good reviews so I decided to try it out, and I'm so happy that I did. The prices are great compared to bigger chains. They have daily specials, fresh ingredients, chefs specials, and a very spacious dining areas with TVs. The subs were so good and really filling. I will never go to another sub place in this area again. Chubby's is my new go-to sub shop."}
{"text":"For take out, this place is 5-stars. I'm only giving it 4 because every table was kinda gross, and greasy... crumbs and food on the chairs. Though there is only one man working, and it's a constant stream of customers so it is very understandable. The subs are huge. Delicious. And very well priced. They have daily specials which are awesome! All of their non cold cut meat is fresh and cooked in house. I HATE fast food bacon, and the bacon served was as if I made it at home myself. I've been looking for a nice classic sub place for some time, and I think I've found it :D 
Yum!"}
{"text":"Some of the best subs I've had in the GTA! You definitely get your money's worth - the freshness of the ingredients and flavours are commendable. The Subway chain across the street better watch out!"}
{"text":"BEST SUB PLACE IN SCARBOROUGH!! 
if you want authentic traditional submarines then this is your place to go. Fresh ingredients everyday, amazing staff, more than reasonable price, so many options on subs, they even make there own chicken breast and jerk chicken for the subs ! I bought 2 foot long assorted subs and it only cost me 12+ tax, that's less than 1 sub at subway, also very generous in toppings. Hands down 5 starss !!"}
{"text":"One of the best subs around.  Better than any chain resto.  The quality and quantity of the meat and toppings were amazing.  I had the turkey bacon on whole wheat.  Yummm"}
{"text":"Best Subs in the Morningside Area.

Chubbys is a great place to grab a sub on the go. The daily specials are fantastic with a good variety of subs at a great price.  

I get the chicken variants. The one thing that brings me back is the fact that the chicken is a real solid piece of meat. Unlike its popular competitors, where the chicken \"patties\" all have the same shape, mushy consistency, and identical char marks. These guys give you a good portion of real meat nicely seasoned. My only con is that the pre cooked meats are microwaved. Not the end of the world, still edible and not rubbery. That said would recommend getting a good amount of sauce, so the sub doesn't turn out too dry. 

The ingredients are your typical assortment. Multiple sauces to choose. 

Overall for the price and the food great place to get a sub. Simple and gets the job done. Would recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"Honestly I have not returned to this place after I found a bug in my sub. They said it must've came from the lettuce package. They refunded my money and offered another sub but, it just turned me off of their food."}
{"text":"An independent family owned sub sandwich store?!

A foot long daily special starting from $5.40?!

Chubby's Subs delivers probably the best bang for the money. I suggest going for their Chicken Sub Special for $6.40 with is made from real chicken breast and not the processed variety.

Toppings and sauces selection is as good as any chain subway joint. I love the option of able to have my sub pressed into a panini.

At a big strip plaza and you probably cannot see the storefront when you drive by Morningside."}
{"text":"Skip the subway across the street and come here instead. 

I always go for the daily special or chef's special and am not disappointed."}
