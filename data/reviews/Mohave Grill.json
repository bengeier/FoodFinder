{"text":"We were at the Mohave Grill sat night for the Alan Doyle concert. My friend contracted what we think was food poisoning? Anyone else have any issues?"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give negative stars on this review? We stayed at a close by hotel and ordered take out via Skip the Dishes.  I really wanted chips and dip and my son wanted wings so we ordered the platter to share.  My husband ordered a beef dip.  The food was beyond gross. Everything was cold and thrown together in a half ass fashion, not to mention they gave us the artichoke dip but no nacho chips.  Usually we wouldn't call to complain about something so small but who gives someone dip and no chips?!  My husband called the restaurant to advise them of their mess up and the waiter proceeded to argue with my husband and tell him nacho chips weren't included until he double checked with someone who then confirm they did. (It stated so in the menu).  We were then told that it's not like it was a lot of food and that we'd only get 10 chips so if we were unhappy we could call back on Wednesday to speak to a manger. (4 days after this occurred!) like for real? Someone has an issue with the food or service and they are to call back 4 days later? Not only will we not be calling back we won't be eating here again. Biggest waste of $60.00."}
{"text":"I recently came here for the dinner buffet at the Mohave Grill. It was quite good, consisting of salads, Mac n cheese, ribs, steamed veggies, prawns, etc. There was also all you can eat prime rib, of which I had two servings. The food was quite good overall, with the exception of the Mac n Cheese. Unfortunately it was rather dry, and it didn't have alot of melted cheese within. Aside from this, the meal was quite good overall, and the prime rib was definitely one of the better ones I have had at an all you can eat buffet. I should also mention that it costs around $30 for the adults, and $15 for the kids. Overall, the experience was pretty good, and I'm sure I'll be back in the future for another buffet from here."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there as part of our stay with the Deerfoot Hotel. They provide breakfast vouchers for guests, the equivalent of a continental breakfast elsewhere. It was probably one of the best continental breakfast I've had at a hotel. They had scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and sausages. Then the usual stuff like waffles, cereal, muffins and pancakes. All good quality and the price is right!"}
