{"text":"Food tasted with nothing to do with the brand's original taste. The steamed dumpling looked very nice but that was all. The dough feels like drywall.  Filling had way too much sesame oil and tasted weird."}
{"text":"At my visit,first thing to get my attention is the bright lighting,feels clean. the decor feels a bit Chinese theme yet contemporary. the tea pot and cup are cute.but the food are pretty normal and even worst than average.end up 108+tax for a guy and two lady which is super pricey for this kind of food quality."}
{"text":"On menu, beijing duck stated as including soup. But they process the order different. When we asked, they said we had to pay extra if we want soup even it said included on the menu. When duck comes, the side dish only available for 3 people but duck was good for 7 people. We ordered one more since not enough to share and roll up duck meats. They charged extra $10. When we asked and explained, manager said it is the way it is. Finally, bill comes as 96 plus tax as 109. Manager said to give us 10% off if we pay cash. We agreed. But, after 10%, bill stated as , cash, 10%off =$5.49. Total bill $104.51. Doesnt know how they do their match."}
{"text":"Horrible! I felt like I've been drinking oil!   Their pork buns was dripping in oil, biting into was quite disgusting. The dumplings things were ok.  The best dish I had was the stir fried vegetables!   If you still end up at this restaurant, DO NOT order the duck! Total waste of money! You are suppose to wrap the duck with a wrap that is similar to like a taco. However, they give you very little sauce and charge you extra when you ask for more! It was ridiculous!   Service was mediocre, they did their job at least, got my order in :)   Food was served pretty quick.   In all, very very disappointed, I don't normally give bad rating to restaurants. This restaurant left me feeling disgusted and feeling like I've been ripped off"}
{"text":"The buns are quite good. They have quite a variety but we only tried the original and seafood. The dough still isn't quite at the texture in China. I highly recommend the three cup chicken which is excellent. Its definitely nice to try a northern Chinese restaurant considering the amount of Cantonese restaurants in the area.   Other reviewers commented on the service, but considering the restaurant just opened, I found the service superior than many Chinese restaurants which often is non-existent. To be honest, the quality of service at every Chinese restaurant is far below than that of western restaurants.   Another issue is the price, compared to other Chinese restaurants, it might be high for steamed buns and other dishes. But I think many people have the mentality that Chinese food equals cheap food. The decor, presentation and quality is comparable to any high end western restaurant. If considered like that, the price isn't too bad at all."}
{"text":"i have too high expectation in the traditional pork bun, but it only have the taste of soy sauce. any other places like Shanghai Dimsum or Ala Kitchen have much better taste of the juicy steamed pork bun than here! service unorganized at all, 2 sections of upstairs and downstairs...on a Saturday night, it's not even crazy busy!  but u can see 3 servers running around for nothing. don't recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Came again to try more items:  Tianjin smoked meat with pancakes - Very good, meat was sliced thin with a variety of condiments and pancake to eat. Flavourful and great texture.  Beef pancake- came in 3 prices with beef and lettuce inside. Crispy outside, good.  Guotie pan fried meat dumpling- 4 pieces, tasted good but nothing special   Noodles in tomato and egg sauce- was very good, noodles are handmade so very yummy and chewy.  Mixed vegetables - Just salad with a vinegar sauce.   Red bean cake- Generous amount of red bean paste but the outside is very dry.  Glutinous balls in sweet fermented rice soup- Good rice ball texture in soup but not enough wine flavour, could add more of the alcohol to enhance the flavor.   Service: Same as last visit, attentive and came to ask what we thought of the dishes."}
{"text":"First experience and came for lunch with hubby. Ordered the traditional pork buns stuffed with ground pork and green onion, juicy pork steamed dumplings, pan fried meat dumplings, crispy dumplings with chives and egg, baked scallion pancake (a but doughy), fried rice with shrimp sausage and fish roe. Everything was generally tasty and love  ambience and decor. Would come back for dinner next time with family to try their geoduck, lobster and desserts."}
{"text":"It's quite pricy for Chinese food that doesn't involve seafood, but the buns are nicely made- all of them fluffy and pretty tasty. Would go back if it was cheaper.  One point off for server:  We wanted a hand pulled noodle, the male server informed us it's not available, then we switched to another noodle, he then said the whole section of the menu wasn't available. My husband said fine, green onion pancake, he said I don't know if this is available, let me check and never came back. When my husband later on inquired, he said that wasn't available either but he ordered for us a similar item- smoked meat with pancakes. What the... not to mention he ordered us an item that was 3 times more expensive than what we wanted."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice and the food is good but I have got to say that the female manager is one of the worse I have seen. She is very rude and always yelling at the waitresses. She is very demeaning and does not seem to treat her employees with respect, it is hard to believe she is a manager. This makes it very uncomfortable to eat there. But the food there is worth a try and the place is quite clean for the most part."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for a long time. Its authentic steamed buns are always hot and yummy. I also like to order peking duck there because price is very reasonable and fresh. The only problem there is parking so you better go early!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time after a friend saw photos of the place online. We came just before their lunch menu ended so it wasn't busy and everyone there appeared to be having lunch themselves. The decor in the restaurant was very pretty compared to other typical chinese restaurants.  We ordered mainly the dumplings (steamed and fried). Personally, I didn't think there was anything spectacular about them and wouldn't really want to try them again."}
{"text":"Not sure why people say this place is too expensive. I'm not extravagant person. The place is fairly well priced! And really good northern style food. We had hot & sour Soup ($8.99 yum traditional favor), mushroom in dry pot ($13.99 spicy hot and lots of mushrooms) and vegetarian buns ($8.99). Best place for taste of Home in toronto. Dingtaifeng  pricing is similar with very limited dish choices. Congee Queen is more expensive and Nobody seems to complain about pricing there. When comes northern style food, people presume needs to be cheap. ( Beautiful restaurant and environment like this is not for you then). I Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Gou Bu Li is a two level restaurant, so actual seating area is slightly bigger than it looks at first glance, but overall the restaurant can get quite loud due to tables being so close together.  Everything is brightly lit and clean.  Menu is all a la carte, which is good because it allows you to order whatever amount of dumplings you want.    While the dumplings are really good, some of the other stir fry dishes are great too.  Dishes are a good size even though it looks small at first glance (our fried rice came in a dome shape which looked small but actually was a decent portion).    The sweet and sour soup was mostly just sour - I'm not sure whether that's the authentic taste, but I prefer a bit more sweet taste.  Food itself would likely warrant a 3 star at least, but their service is really lackluster, and we actually got invited to leave towards the end of our meal because they were so busy.  I understand restaurants need to do this, but they didn't bother to be subtle about this at all.  They literally just told us we need to leave very soon.  This just ended our meal very abruptly and it's just bad practice from a restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW, what a total 180! Came here tonight with fond memories of last weeks visit only to be the total polar opposite.   We now know who the infamous \"Candy\" is..LOL, totally rude af lady that should no way be part of the customer service staff. Like damn! If we weren't meeting other people there night we would have left right at the moment she gave us the most f'ed up attitude In the history of dining out.  That is just the beginning of the horror story though.   After we ordered and were waiting for the food I noticed one of the waitresses coughing profusely into the palm of her hand. Phlegm and everything! Then wiping it on her pant leg. I was like dammmnnnn son! I am not eating anything she is bringing to our table. It ends up she's bringing everything to our table! And to top it off another waitress that brings the food also is sick. This one is holding a flipping used tissue in her hand wiping her nose and then using the same tissue and gripping the plated food with it.   I am totally apologetic to those ppl who may have read my previous review and ate here based off that. You people need to stay away like the Black Plague! It's silent hill up in here!"}
{"text":"Xiaolongbao on point! Tastes like the ones I had in shanghai. Jellyfish was really good - crunchy, sweet and sour. Cold chicken has the sauce separately in a dish, to accommodate ones that don't eat spicy food. Mapo tofu was okay, not spicy. Fish row fried rice was loaded with goodies. Gobuli bun was okay, I expected more fillings. Snow pea sprouts was good, but the oyster mushrooms was the dried type as opposed to the normal fresh ones. Interior is nice. Service is better than most Chinese restaurants. They're also giving out this VIP card for free."}
{"text":"The environment is really relaxing and chilling.  It was really well decorated, but I found the large mural of a Beijing opera singer staring at you to be a little weird.     As for customer service, I really don't like being pressured to order things that I might not like to eat.  I think it is normal to upsell your products, but being pressured to order more was the last thing that I wanted when I am eating out.  They may think that this is good service, but for me, this is borderline poor service.  Well, maybe this is how this restaurant considered to be good customer service to breath down the customers' necks and tried to coerce them to order more.     The highly recommended baos really lack in amount of meat, flavours and fluffiness.  I have tasted many baos in my life before and I usually loved the ones that are fresh and fluffy.  However, the bao offered by this restaurant for $2.10 each was gummy, soggy, and the outside was covered with spots of watermark.    I was glad that each of us at the table only ordered one bun per person.  The sesame oil peanut butter chicken with noodles was good with bold flavour.  The lamb with cumins was just bad news as I didn't really taste any lamb flavour and the cumin flavours were not strong at all.  I think the cumin maybe stale as it was so mild that I barely tasted any cumin flavour.  The bao and the lamb were both a big disappointment.  One of the waiters or maybe he is the manager was extremely impolite as he was banging on the table every time he refill the tea for our table.  I rather him not come by if he cannot even put the teapot onto the table properly.  I simply wouldn't come back to this restaurant as the price was steep, food was not okay, and poor customer service.   We each ended up paying $45 for 3 small baos and 2 dishes."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.0/5.0  Located where Chingu Korean BBQ used to be; Goubuli recently opened its first restaurant here in Canada which is known for its steamed buns originating from Tianjin, China.  Walking into the restaurant you will notice a very clean cut and elegant layout though not as grand as Yu Seafood.   Expect an average wait time of 15-30 minutes on weekdays and even line ups that span outside the front door on weekends. However, this place does not deserve the hype nor line up that they are getting.   We first ordered four different variations of their famous steamed buns. At around $2.50 each depending on which one you get, these buns were quite mediocre. Filling was lacking in general and underwhelming. The lobster filled bun was bland and looked as though it was mixed in with some filler items.  Secondly we tried the kung pow chicken which was just alright. Most of the menu items were pretty standard and uninspiring. In fact, the menu is not like what you would see at their other locations overseas. Similar food can be had elsewhere with better taste, quality and pricing.  Again, this place makes an attempt to present itself as a upscale restaurant but definitely falls short. If you want to feel like a baller and don't mind paying a premium for mediocre food then this is just the place!  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The service are good. They definitely had spend good money and time on its decorations. However their food was mediocre. They are known for meat bun. But they had failed. The waitress told me the bun was juicy bite. However it turn out to be filled with oil. I was very disappointed. I wouldn't expect much more for other food if they had failed what they are known for. But I still give it three stars for its service and decorations. Cheers."}
{"text":"Overpriced is not even the issue here, I've had better food and baozi at places that are a fraction of the cost and the portions of some dishes are ridiculous. Came here because I kept seeing their ad everywhere, now I see their need for advertisement. Also when we came in it was pretty filled up on the first floor so we asked to sit on the second level and they told us it wasn't open yet. However 5 minutes into sitting down a couple that was perhaps a frequent customer was immediately shown upstairs. Then another family behind them also asked to sit upstairs and was also refused. What?! Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Sunday night at 7:30pm and luckily got a table for two right away. The restaurant was packed but no line, there was a steady flow of customers. We tried their signature Gou Bu Li (meat bun), $9.99/8 (or $1.5 per bun on weekdays), a spicy fish ($16.99) and a Kung Pao Chicken ($13.99).   It was quite a pleasant meal, the buns were really flavourful, for its size, probably 2 per person would be a good amount. The fish was not as spicy as Szechuan style, but more on the sour and 'numb' side. We also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't so oily as other Northern restaurants. The Kung Pao chicken was sweet, probably added quite an amount of sugar. It was okay, but the fish was more enjoyable.  The interior decor and cleaniness was definitely better than a lot of chinese restaurants. They also have a small room for 8-11 ppl, with $300 min charge.   We'd definitely go back, and may visit for lunch, to try their noodles and other dimsums that aren't offered at dinner time."}
{"text":"I will give a 3.5 to this restaurant.  I went there to have a brunch with my family on a Saturday around 11:00. We didn't order any main dish, just Buns and snack dish. We ordered A6 Ancient Recipe Marinated Pork Steamed Buns and A7 Goubuli Juicy Pork Steamed Buns. Both of them taste great. A6 comes with unique Chinese chives flavor and the pork is well marinated, yum yum! A7 is very juicy and the texture of the pork filling is good, not outstanding but I will give a thumb up to this one. And I counted, 18 zhe on each of the buns.  The Jellied Bean Curd [ SALTY ] is a good try. The topping is quite generous and savory. The texture of the tofu is a little bit hard for me. I prefer it to be softer. And the traditional Chinese Savour Crepe tastes not bad but I think it's a little bit too sweet. More spicy sauce added would be better.  The decor of Goubuli is fancy and exquisite. The adequate lighting makes the dining experience even better. The price is comparatively a little bit higher. I think it is a good place for business lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is getting a bad rep on Yelp from a couple picky people with bad attitudes.   Disclaimer- It's probably not a Five Star joint, but I felt obligated to give them a five star because so many of the other reviews were unfairly harsh.   The food was very good, it wasn't great, but it was fair value for the price. I don't live in the area so I probably won't get the privilege of eating here again, but if I lived closer I would absolutely eat here again.   Nobody gave us any attitude and the staff was very friendly. They even gave my toddler her own plastic bowl and cup, so she wouldn't risk breaking things. She loved that and it made the whole experience nicer for my wife and I.   Give them a try and then give them a fair review. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by a colleague and must say, it was an enjoyable dining experience (3.5 rounded up).   The good (Chinese dishes loosely translated): cold noodle with chicken is delicious, the baos (while not perfect) are decently sized and juicy with a fairly thin dough, mushroom in a clay pot had an awesome spicy flavour.   The mediocre: minced pork with braised eggplant (way too sweet), xiao long bao (juicy pork filled dumplings, come in 10s in a bamboo steamer).   The ambiance is great, one of the better decorated Chinese restaurants and servingware / restaurant as a whole is pristinely clean (thumbs up!)   The pricing is moderately pricy so more of a place to treat friends and family. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today with a co-worker. I've heard that it's a popular chain for their buns. So it was a must try. We each got one of their special bun. They were very very tiny, about 2\" by 2\" for $2.10 a piece. We also got their Tianjin style hot and sour soup and their most popular fried rice, according to the server. Soup was $8.99 and rice was $13.99   Bun was not bad, flavour was good, nothing super special though. Soup was different than the typical hot and sour soup. It was heavy with black pepper, which I didn't mind. It was a lighter version than the typical, in terms of flavour and sourness. Fried rice was really nothing special and definitely not worth the price. It was just a mix of chopped shrimp, Chinese sausage, mushrooms, beans, with roe on top. Taste was meh, can get the same thing for half the price. Portions are not generous.  Service was good, servers were very friendly for a Chinese restaurant. Decor was very nice. This place used to be a Korean BBQ but they have fully renovated the entire interior. I can say I've been, but I wouldn't go back. Not worth the value for the high prices."}
{"text":"I came here around 8pm and had reservations. Right at the front we were being helped by a women name Candy (I think she's the supervisor) she was being super unfriendly saying she couldn't find our reservation. Someone else had to come and just asked us for our phone number and seated us. We had a party of 6 and some of my friends were running late (about 5 mins). Candy was standing beside our table the whole time and than spoke in Cantonese saying \"why are they just sitting there taking up the table\". I'm not sure if she knew we could understand but it was so uncomfortable and made our whole experience unenjoyable. Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing but for the price you would expect the service to be at least mediocre"}
{"text":"Here's an updated review:  I came back mostly for the Roasted Duck, and I wasn't as disappointed. The dishes were definitely hotter this time - which made the experience better.   We reordered the GouBuLi Juicy Pork Steamed Buns, and the Fish with Chilli and Pepper. Tasted just as good as last time. So it's safe to say it'll be consistent.   Sliced Roast Duck (with spring pancakes, and tofu and vegetable duck-stock soup) with pepper salt. It was above average. SOUP WAS SO GOOD. However, there were not enough spring pancakes for the slices, so we had to wait for extra. Another thing that could be improved are the toppings provided. There did not seem to be enough for everyone to have with each wrap, and the options didn't look too fresh. However, the raisins were a pretty sweet addition.   Jelly Fish with Black Vinegar is a very traditional choice. The Jelly Fish was really good (great density and texture), but the vinegar may have been too sour for our taste. We would have preferred spicy. It also came with cucumbers at the bottom.   Stewed Beef Sirloin and Gluten was very good as well. The beef was less like sirloin and more like brisket! The gluten was cooked well, and soft. It soaked up the stew well.   Overall, I still don't think this place is that special. I'm not sold for some reason. I still want to try their fancy Hotpot. I did really enjoy the roasted duck slices and soups (duck stock soup, and herbs soups), but it's hard to come back for just that.   The washrooms aren't that clean either."}
{"text":"Room is nice but food was a failure, all dishes were lacking in taste despite being very fatty. House special steam buns were underwhelming , beef dish full of gristle, Peking Duck was just ok, pancakes gluey, Green onion cakes tasted like whole wheat flour with scant onion, hot and sour soup was just one note, vinegar and had a grey tinge. Fried rice was dry and old? Pan fried pork dumpling were funny texture inside meat had been worked into a paste. Best dish was sautéed snow pea leaves. All in all bad experience, will not go back.  Maybe hot pots are better? They look fancy but lack of flavour in everything we had means I wouldn't risk a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Not an expert on authenticity but definitely an expert on taste and the aptly named Gou Bu Li steam bun tastes simply amazing! Out of this world even dare I say!  Other dishes mostly tasted good to great. Duck breast was yummy as well. Their Signature fried rice was light and low on sodium which is how I like mine.  The restaurant atmo is clean and fairly bright. They have an additional loft area on the second floor with a more private setting as well as the main floor tables and VIP room.  Overall I really enjoyed the food here and will be going back for those yummy buns."}
{"text":"Bad: -Too much msg, we drink lots of tea, -Simple salad dip in sodium, we re order one and is the same.   -didn't refund the hair salad at the end need to be reminded  -careless rice come with white plastic chip (see photo) -poor personal hygiene come with hair ( see picture ) -bad service not even a singe sorry about the hair. -the meat in the bun textured like sand   -cost 40$ per person    Good: -Clean Reno good lighting   Not worth going at all beware"}
{"text":"This place closes between 3 to 5:30pm everyday! They are so lazy, they don't even bother to turn the OPEN sign off. Really, is this such a high-end restaurant that we aren't worthy of getting served outside core meal times? This place just opened up, so if the management running the place had half a brain, they wouldn't turn away customers so that their lazy cooks and servers can take their afternoon nap."}
{"text":"Two words: rude service. She refused us to have a table of four that is away from the kitchen (she gave us a table of four that is right beside the kitchen) because we only have three people, not four people. She insisted that table is for four people not three. However, next minute, then she serve another customer of TWO for the same table we want. We left right away, didn't bother to eat anyway."}
{"text":"We visited twice within 3 days! Price is a bit higher for Chinese restaurant but I have to be fair: nice decor and nice TianJin delicacies (pastries and rolling donkey!). We ordered 10*4 for our guests from the state to take back home!  Steamed buns are a bit oily to me but my 2.5 year old girl had almost 4 of them. Main courses in general are above average and the appetizers are little pricey though.  The sweet delicacies and steam glutinous rice (???) are must try.  Every time we ordered a lot for party of 4 plus a little one, but this is the place worth coming back as long as quality stays consistent.  Our primary server is a little tough but we are okay."}
{"text":"1 star is for their food. It's pretty good i'd say, but not worth for the service or attitude.  Came here in November, so this is a late post but my mom booked a reservation for 27 people after the wait staff ensured they could accommodate a family gathering for lunch. When we arrived the day of the reservation they gave us 2 tables telling us it would fit all of us. We mapped out the seats and it could fit 20 max (this is us being all cramped together). The staff was less than helpful, and had an abrasive attitude. Also, because we spoke to them in mandarin, they started talking about us in cantonese (I assume they didn't think we understood, until we started talking in cantonese to them too). I also overheard the wait staff talking to each other, and they were complaining about another customer from before and the response from one of them was \"oh just tell them to eat sh*t.\" I honestly don't think you should yell this across a few tables when other customers are around. I get customers can be wrong at times and hard to deal with, but why would you say that when other customers are around? It just seems offensive.  Also, when we were ordering food, they seemed to run out of every other thing we wanted to order, and we were there at 12:30 for lunch...  Needless to say, after all the hassle and disrespectful wait staff experience, all my family members are set on never returning to this establishment. The food may be good, but the service and experience was horrendous."}
{"text":"Didn't have very high expectations based on the reviews and then was pleasantly surprised by the meat buns! Pretty juicy! Xiaolongbao is also soupy with nice, thin crust. Also loved the dry pot with mixed mushrooms. I think you can't go wrong ordering what they're known for. Don't go for the canto/taiwanese stuff."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes because this place is famous for their Goubuli Steamed Buns.  After my first bite, I was thoroughly disappointed. The bun was really dry and quite flavourless. Luckily we ordered other dishes to offset the lack of flavour. Their Braised Pork Belly was quite tender and delicious!  Overall this place was not great. Prices were high and food was pretty poor. Service was mediocre too. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with huge regrets.  Not only was the menu lacking decent lunch options, the price tag was steep.  Very steep.  I could eat similar items at mom and pop shops for half the price.  8 steamed pork buns was $15.99.  They were small and the taste didn't blow me away.  It doesn't taste bad, but at $2 a bao, I expect more.  The smoked pork platter was decent though, but the price tag was $15.99 as well which I find steep, but not as steep as the baos.  The hot and sour soup lacked the \"hot\".  Black pepper taste overpowered the soup with a hint of sour. I didn't like how they added pork blood jello in the soup....meh.  If you're eating here, you're literally paying more for the decor, high quality tea and service.  I rather pay less for better tasting food at half the price."}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in is the beautiful elegant decor. The place looks great!  We ordered xiao long bao (soup filled pork dumplings-steamed), the spicy stringed chicken, one of their signature meat dumplings and dessert. Their soup filled dumplings are ok, I prefer the ones from the other two big name restaurants over this place's. The skin on the dumpling is thicker then other places. The chicken was spicy but taste was just ok, missing something and nothing special. The glutinous dessert balls were very good! Very fresh, this is the only thing I'd recommend eating at this restaurant. The seasame cake and egg cake was very dry and hard to eat. We did not finish it.  The service here is very commendable. The waiter was at our every beck and call, it was very impressive. I'm not sure of the service alone would be enough to get me to return though."}
{"text":"We randomly stumbled into this restaurant without any reviews or recommendations. It looks newly renovated and feels like a higher end Chinese restaurant. The service was good and spacious seating. We ordered the juicy pork steamed buns (10 per order), snow pea sprouts with pan fried oyster mushroom (very good and large portion), and Taiwan style three cup chicken  (very flavourful and paired well with a plain rice). We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  They serve northern China style dishes here.  I ordered the Pork steamed dumpling, the braised fatty pork and some bao's.  I especially liked the thin wrap that they use for the pork steamed dumplings.  Everything tasted delicious, however, the food can be a bit heavy/greasy.  Their decor is pretty modern and the glass lets you see right into the kitchen.  The seating is fairly roomy making it great for larger parties. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food but the two star is for the horrible experience.   In the middle of our dinner, the manager (candy or cathy) walked up stairs and started yelling and arguing with our waiter. It was loud, rude and uncomfortable. As a manager of a restaurant, you never deal with any issues in front of your customer...let alone have a shouting match."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and we have ordered the following:  Goubuli Juicy Pork Steamed Dumpling Red Bean Cake Glutinous Balls in Sweet Fermented Rice Soup Fried Rice with Dried Shrimp in Lotus Leaf Beef Pancake Tianjin Smoked Meat with home made pancake Mixed Vegetables Noodles in Tomato and Egg Sauce  The Dumpling is juicy. We didn't have to add any sauce on top to go with it.  It came in a bundle of 8 buns.  Red Bean Cake is sweet but a bit hard, I would prefer the Shanghai version better.  The Sweet Fermented Rice Soup is good but need more alcohol in there.    The Fried rice in Lotus Leaf is good..Definitely worth ordering.  It has a lot of ingredients.  Beef Pancake is so so and very beefy to me.  Smoke meat with pancake is good.  Very original with specialty sauce that you can apply on it.  Mixed Vegetables is like salad to me.  It didn't surprised me.  Noodle in Tomato with chicken and egg sauce is unique.  The noodle is home made and very chewy.  Overall this restaurant is worth coming.  It is a bit pricey compare to other restaurant."}
{"text":"Great delicious food, clean and tidy, nice environment, reasonably price, recommend strongly!"}
{"text":"Found this northern China style dim sum place through Yelp and decided to give it a try. Northern China dim sum specializes in dumplings and Bao's so that's what we focused on.  Right off the bat, I like the decor. It's pretty and has the fusion feel with split level seating. Nice place to go for lunch in an airy and fusion atmosphere. Mind you, The restaura is not that big so if you go during rush times may have to wait.  Service is okay. We went at 1:30 on a Saturday and it was still fairly busy. They didn't check up on us but we were able to flag down a waitstaff in a couple minutes.  My hubby is a huge soup filled pork dumpling aka Xiao long bao connaisseur, and he gives their version a thumbs up. Soupy, not too oily, good amount of filling, and thin skin that held up without breaking.  Their savoury crepe was also quite popular so we tried that but I was disappointed. Savoury crepe was not good at all. It was dry and tasteless. Then we tried the traditional pork Steamed buns and it was smaller than usual and tasted quite  boring.  Other items we ordered were the Potstickers which was tasty and cooked very well and the Wonton soup which was decent. There were two other items we wanted to try but we're told they were sold out.  Overall, the restaurant is fine. They had some great dishes and some forgettable ones. I think for the nice atmosphere it's worth a visit, but to bring people back they have a bit of menu editing to do. Rule to live by: if you can't make a dish tasty or interesting, scrap it!"}
{"text":"They have ads on wechat for weeks, so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at 5:00pm Saturday afternoon. It was quite empty, we were greeted by a man who looks like a manager. Very casually seated us and brought us the menu and tea. The tea was not even hot. We wanted to order 5 items, but 2 were sold out at 5:00pm Saturday afternoon. So we ended ordering 3 items only, the traditional bao with pork, not impressive at all, the same level as I can make at home, very strong smell of yeast, same skill as mine. 2nd item is Jing jiang meat with wraps, too sweet, presentation is good. Fish with chilli, we told the manager we wanted less spicy, he said ok, but it ended up with covered all chilli and hua jiao, we had to spend 10 mins to get rid of the chilli first.  The waitress brought us the food looked very angry. Over all, nice decoration, mediocre food, little pricy, bad service or no service.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Delicious steamed buns... as far as the eye can see. :)  Their specialty is the pork steamed buns.  I ordered the seafood ones and found them very tasty.  Jenny, my server was amazingly informative and helpful for choosing what to order.    I had individual soup (chicken broth) and took another soup (Tianjin Hot and Sour) to go - both were delicious.    Desserts were not too sweet and were going quickly on a Friday night.    Price seemed reasonable to me.  They have cheaper lunchtime pricing."}
{"text":"Goubuli is a jewel tucked in the hustle and bustle of the ever expanding Markham and richmond hill.   The long line ups are an indication of the quality to expect. An excellent and refreshing atmosphere and decor serves wonderfully with the fresh hand made baos.  And adorable addition to the Markham & richmond hill dining experience"}
{"text":"Located in a very busy plaza, its really hard to find parking during lunch hour. Very nice place, bright, clean and surprisingly spacious.  Food is good and a little pricey but serving is big. We started of with traditional pork buns which i find the bun too thick, nothing special but tastes ok.  Then have Goubuli juicy pork steamed buns(xiao long pao) which is very tasty, served hot and love the taste of the soup in the buns. We also had Tianjin smoked meat with pancake, the meat is tasteless need to add sauce together with cucumber and leeks to enjoy it with the crispy pancake. Kungpao prawn, has huge sized prawns and lots of chili, not very spicy, kind of spicy with sweet taste mixed in 1. Taiwanese 3 cup chicken is served in a pot with lots of cloves of garlic, beef pancake and Stir fried beef with mushroom and green onion taste good too.  I recommend the sauteed shredded pork with soy bean paste, this comes with thin pancakes and the taste is like peking duck. Also, I love the fried rice with soy sauce and dried shrimp, it has a fragrant smell, looks very appetizing and the taste compliments the smell and look. I would say everything I tried today is satisfying to both taste buds and tummy!   Service is good and fast. Our server is very friendly. They make sure we got everything we need.  Must try this place out and there are more interesting food to try out next time!"}
{"text":"I would say 3 stars for the food, but rounding up because we had very courteous and polite service. We tried some of their dumplings, pork and crab versions of the siu loong bao, as well as some of their signature buns. They were just okay. The hand shredded cold chicken dish was okay too. We were a large party of 15 that walked in for a late lunch, and they were very nice and gave us the semi-private back room with a large table for all of us. We left a personal item behind and the manager was very nice to help us retrieve it when we called to track it down."}
{"text":"Shanghai steamed buns is my favourite dish from my hometown. I want to find a place in Toronto/GTA that's as close as it gets, and surprising, this place makes amazing steamed buns.   Food first, must try their crab and pork steamed buns. Then there's the braised lamb in casserole. No chinese restaurants has topped this lamb dish yet!! It's heavenly. Their hand pulled chicken is delicious as well.  Elegant decor, and surprising pleasing service from the servers. You can also call for takeout, which I've done many times for their steamed buns; although they taste a billion times better fresh at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and presentation of food. I can smell some chemicals from construction close to the door whenever the door opens. Food is so so, lacking in flavour. There is a few restaurants offering similar kind of food close by and would go there instead."}
{"text":"Just.So.Disappointed.  Decor: Fine  Efficient use of space, airy, nice seating. Trying too hard to pursue art deco on a budget.  Food: Subpar  The baos were ok, but most other cold/hot dishes were barely tolerable for its pretentious prices. Nothing felt fresh.  Service: Mixed The waiter/servers were excellent, and the food came very quickly, but the manager/host was absolutely repulsive. He had a horrible attitude throughout our meal, and tried to lie and cheat us into tipping extra.  Such a shame for the poor staff.  Verdict: Never coming back Other than the excellent tea, I can't find any other positives. There was also puke, consisting of red bean congee, on the urinal of one of the well decorated restrooms I've visited...Which was an experience.   As a kid who came from Tianjin, the birthplace of Goubuli, I barely had any faith in the brand. If this is a legitimate franchise of Goubuli, then I have completely given up on the pride of my birth city."}
{"text":"walked in not expecting the interior to be so pretty! there is an upstairs too very fancy.  a pretty big selection of dishes on the menu, but we mainly came for the buns. got the traditional pork buns (4/5) and juicy pork steam buns (5/5). the traditional pork bun had a thick dough with not a lot of filling which i didn't like, but the taste was good. the juicy pork buns (basically xiaolongbao) was perfect a lot of soup in the buns and it didn't burn your tongue at all like some other ones i've tried.    also got chinese savior crepe and beef pancake, which i do not recommend. the crepe did not have a lot of flavour and was not crispy enough. the ones they make at tnt are a lot better. the beef pancake was dry, and they put the type of lettuce they have in mcdonald's mcchicken burgers in it which i did not expect lol it was not that good   other dishes were all mediocre, nothing amazing and it is very expensive. not sure if i would come back but the buns are a must try if anyone decides to come."}
{"text":"My hometown's reputation is ruined! The mashed eggplant is a joke, served on Pringles! ???? is paired with dried cranberries! I'm fainting..."}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try after my friend described this new restaurant as \"fancy\". Apparently from the decoration the owner wants it to be kind of a high-end one, but I think that's all they put effort on. I mean, you will feel it \"fancy\" until you really get their services. Most of the waitresses are in plain face and don't care if you like it or not. Regarding the food, six of us ordered about 8 or 9 dishes but am only impressed by the lamb, everything else is either average or below. It is ok if you charge for a more reasonable price, but for the price we pay, we are not even close to what we should get. And one more thing we feel wired is that, the plates are so big but the food is in small amount. Our table is small, and as soon as they put the food on, we have to suggest them to put them on a smaller plate in order to make room for the food. All I am trying to say here is that, if you really want to make it a high-end restaurant, make better food and train the staff to have better services"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see how amazing the service and decor is inside this restaurant. The food tastes and looks good. Totally worth the price!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem alright, a lot of people seem to enjoy the quality of freshly sliced beef and lamb in the hot pot, when I mean freshly sliced, it would be a long wait, so you should enter when you are just about to be hungry, but the time the beef arrived, you would feel really hungry. All joking aside, I loved their stir-fry lamb, so delicious and yummy. Their single order menu are simple, yet offer little clue what you are about to eat, but talking to the server, they would soon get a picture menu should knock the socks off for all of you."}
