{"text":"I waited forever for a table then even longer for my order. It took over thirty minutes to get my check and it was over priced!  I waited so long for my check I actually thought about just leaving!  It was the worst  experience I've ever had I will never go back!  I miss native new yorker!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative star option. I call in an order, nothing super crazy, 3 lbs of boneless, 24 bone in, and a few apps and was told 15 min. Mind you the world series was on as was a Cowboys game. I show up 20 min later and it's not ready. She says oh they are just getting it together for you. It was another 30 min of standing in the lobby until I got my order. All they said was \"she should have quoted you a longer time\". Um, ya think?  Don't waste your time here as they don't value your time."}
{"text":"Gross there was a hair in our fries! Grossed us out couldn't finish our food but they still made us pay minus the fries. I think the whole meal should have been free!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here for the first time yesterday. We figured it was right next to the theatre, where we were going to watch a movie after, so why not? The dining area off to the right was pretty full, so we sat at a booth in the bar room. At first it looked like only one waiter was serving for the entire bar room. Finally, someone walked out of the kitchen and came up to us to take our drink orders.  I ordered water, and a lemon-tini. She came back fairly quick with our drinks, except I was given a tea with lemon... simple mistake, no biggie. We already knew what we wanted food wise, so we placed our order with our drinks- I ordered the boneless stripper wing platter with fries, and my boyfriend ordered a simple burger and fries.   We sit there and wait...... and wait..... finally, 10 minutes goes by and I still haven't gotten the lemon-tini I ordered. I look at the bar and see it sitting up there, and see the waitress standing off to the side watching tv. She glances at my drink, and then walks into the kitchen and comes back out to go over to where the menus are stacked and chats with another server. I get her attention and ask if my drink is ready, and she says, \"Oh! I'm sorry, I asked another server to run it for me, I guess they didn't.\" She of course, as to my guess, grabbed the drink I figured was mine that was just sitting there on the bar.  Uhhh what? You asked another server to run a drink for you, so you could watch the game on TV? Wow.   So then, we wait. And wait....... and wait. By this point we had been there for about a half our. A half hour, for some wings and a burger??  My boyfriend gets up and goes to talk to the waitress, who was again just standing there watching TV. He heads to the bathroom to wash his hands, while she goes to the kitchen to check on the food, and sure enough.... literally right after my boyfriend said something to her and went to the bathroom, she comes out of the kitchen with our food.  He comes back from washing his hands, just as she is setting the food down on the table. At this point I knew our food had probably just been sitting in the kitchen. I tasted a fry, it was hot... ok cool, lets try the wings.  They weren't even luke warm!!! The wings on the outside of the plate were cold. Literally cold, and the ones in the middle were barely luke warm.  My boyfriend bites into his burger, and what do you know??? Barely luke warm.   Our food had obviously been sitting there for a while, for it to have gotten that cold.   He gets the manager, who asks if I want my wings re made, but at this point we don't have time because of the movie time. He said he would give us boxes to take it home, and he would take care of the meals for us. During this time, he was rushed and didn't really seem too genuine about his apology, and he hurried off. The waitress comes with the check, and we see that he only took the wings off of the tab.  Bull crap, we waited a half hour for some cold wings and a cold burger- and you want us to pay for it? Hell no. So I told the waitress flat out I wasn't going to pay for cold food.   She comes back with the revised tab, and I paid for the drinks. The manager comes back and gives us two $10 vouchers to visit any Native Bar & Grill. He then took the time to actually apologize, and seem sincere. I told him that this was our first time visiting. I've worked in the service industry for 7 years on and off, and was not impressed. He apologized again, and we went on our way to watch the movie.  IDK what the deal was, the bar area was not that busy, while yes the dining room was, but that does not excuse cold food and a lazy waitress who just wants to watch TV.   We won't be going back to that location."}
{"text":"Amber the bartender is awesome. Very nice and happy!  Plus the wings were super HOT unlike the other native I go to. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Its super cool. Favorite bartender is Travis. The pregnant girl my favorite waitress."}
{"text":"This native is a convenient location for myself! We have had nothing but great service at this location! The wings are extraordinary, just wish they ran wing specials all weekend just not Sunday!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite wing places. I can only comment on the wings nothing else since I have only ever ordered wings from there. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because the wings or very good the place is clean and organized.... But the servers lately ever since the remodel are just not there. Takes forever to get even a menu when you sit in the bar and when you finally do it takes another 10-15min just for them to come back once. Recommend to try but have patience."}
{"text":"Always a disappointing experience. I don't know how this place became a chain. I keep giving it a chance due to going with friends periodically and always leave shaking my head wondering how they are still in business. Do yourself a favor...go to the grocery store and buy some frozen food, you will save money and get the same quality."}
{"text":"Update!  Just decided to have a Native Burger instead of the wings.. Wow! Extremely delicious! The bun was fresh, the patty didn't taste like it was just out of the freezer. Thanks very much to Kari for the suggestion! Her positive manner is one of the top reasons I keep coming back :-) Thanks again!"}
{"text":"We used to come to native for the wings... However, it seems like will need to find a new place. Our server brought us these poor looking wings"}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is pretty much a Phoenix tradition... it seems that there is a location every couple of miles. We used to go here quite a bit, but the Ahwatukee bar has begun to get a bit run down, and the crowd is starting to have a bit to be desired (although we went during UFC Fight Night, so that could have something to do with it). We also like to sit on the patio, and it has pretty much become a smokers den.  Hopefully the restaurant will get a bit of a makeover soon to bring it on par with the newer locations."}
{"text":"Cat is awesome ......it's really busy but she is always here for us.  She is really great.....she alone will make me come back"}
{"text":"THREE STRIKES AND YOU ARE OUT NATIVE GRILL! This is the THIRD time in six months that a waitress has FORGOT to put our order in and we watched three to four tables who were seated AFTER us get their food BEFORE us. Wrong ice tea's brought to the table during our hour and fifteen minute wait for food only to have the waitress avoid us when she realized she messed up. We walked out when the manager came out and said she \"thinks\" that our order was forgotten. It was on a Sunday night and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all...pathetic! Avoid this place, sadly you will get a better experience at the Denny's right next door!"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst restaurant I have ever been to. And I've been to Denny's. I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it zero.   If you need more reasons not to go other than my word, my friend's 9 dollar calzone was so disgusting that she didn't eat more than 1/4 of it, and when she told the waiter, Dan, that she didn't want it, he took it away and still charged for it. Thanks, chode. It took 15 minutes for anyone to even take our order, all our food was borderline inedible, and I left with a stomach ache and the worst case of the farts for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"\"Native\" is your average pub food. Pretty good especially after a few beers. If you are adventurous I recommend trying the Ghost Pepper wings. Holy cow those are hot! Eating one of those is like getting a tattoo, you'll never forget the experience."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was cold. My woman and I order the wings for 49cents each which is a awesome deal! I was very suspicious at first because the wings came out within 3 minutes of ordering them soo I figured they wouldnt be fresh and I was right, the wings were room temperature then become cold within a few minutes of eating them. The service was good, our waiter was sweet. I heard others at a different table complain about how they know the food there isnt fresh so they demanded fresh food. Will never be coming to this specific native again."}
{"text":"Service stinks.....We stopped in and waited for 5-10 minutes and we left as no one came over to get us a drink.  They were not busy.  Grrrrrrr"}
{"text":"Waited outside for 45 minutes.  Then sat down at 2 tables for 12 people.  Drinks took 12 minutes and food took an hour and 10 minutes.  Food was terrible but the drinks were good.   Chicken wings were super small and the chicken strips were a dry batter and flat.  Only reason they were busy is because there are hardly any restaurants in San tan valley.  Cole slaw was awful as well.  Also when outside waiting they have no benches or misters.  And their was two pregnant woman there. Horrible experience i will never go back."}
{"text":"Disaster.... food , ambience    Doesn't accept groupons, gift certificates even though they say it is valid at that location... that's rude... food is below avg"}
{"text":"This place is starting to be more and more  of my least place to eat. I sit down by the bar and wait at least 5 min for an acknowledgement. I still had to wait for the server to come over just to ask me what I wanted to drink without asking me what kind of specials. She finally asked if I wanted a menu. I asked for a Corona, she comes back with it(no lime no lemon). I then had to wait another five montes for the lime or lemon and the menu. Once finally get to order my food and it comes to my table I get all halves of the wings and 1 drummet! WTH? Now she knows I'm bothered. I send it wings back and just ask for all drummets. When she came back, I apologized for seeming so difficult. Her response was they've been so busy, the chef probably wasn't paying attention. Ummmm....I'm looking around and there's hardly no one in here. Its mid afternoon after lunch and before dinner. It's not even football season. I don't care if It's busy, a good restaurants service should always be a good one.  Once I'm finished with my food and paying for it, I go to the bathroom and it is SO DIRTY! It smelled really bad. No toilets are flushed. Paper towels on the floor. Just dirty. What is going on with this place. Not s good experience at all."}
{"text":"Had Julian tonight.  Great service and he was very friendly and made us feel at home. Good crowd lots of families but you would never know they were busy with the attention we received and as usual food was great."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food and Kate is the best bartender ever. She always makes sure our drinks are perfect. She is very friendly and helpful. Great beer, food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"OK since every place can have a  bad night decided to give them another shot. Stayed away from the chips and the artichoke dip. Ordered 24 wings and the potato skins. Stressed with the waitress PLEASE make sure the wings are not cold. Well sorry showed up cold as usual. Failed second attempt so off our list of acceptable places to dine."}
{"text":"I was in Native today with my 7 year old. We waited 15 minutes, after being seated just to have a Waiter stop to ask if anyone helped me. I replied no he never gave his name but took our drink order. We again waited 7 minutes to receive our drinks. When they came he took our order I ordered 2 dozen salt and pepper wings extra crispy that came fairly timely but had some sort of really bad lime flavor. He passed us 7 or 8 times, I lost count. My son finished his drink and wanted another do he asked me 4 separate times if the guy could get him a drink. Bottom line the worst service I've ever had. The only pleasant thing was the hostess was very nice"}
{"text":"The wings were very good. The pizza is definitely different than any pizza I ever had. They had towelettes which were pretty cool. The only problem I have was the wait. Some people ordered after we did and they got their food first. It was a good 40 minute wait I had to go through."}
{"text":"Renee is the best....she made our experience A+. Good good, great setvice!!!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this location several times. Food is always real good but the service is horrible here."}
{"text":"It really is the worst native around, the hostess clearly does not care about her job and the manager is just as bad, walked out 4 min later and went to gilbert and Germann and had a completely different experience!!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the wings at these restaraunts, and it is low key and casual. It's not a sports bar, but there are usually games on the flat screens, so its just a nice wing and beer place."}
{"text":"Gross Cobb salad. Paid 47 bucks for 3 salads and a dozen wings. I got slimy nasty lettuce as a the bed for a Cobb salad. Can't believe they thought this was supposed to be fresh."}
{"text":"All those with negative reviews please go back and check out the new staff very friendly and polite with excellent service. We had an excellent time with our waiter and will be back many more times to come!"}
{"text":"They can be a bit slow on the service at this location but overall who can beat a great wing place like Native New Yorker. Having said that, the patio is a joke. Don't bother with that. Eat in the bar. Much better atmosphere there."}
{"text":"Love bringing my kids here to watch the Cardinals games. Great food, and awesome service especially our waiter Falcone."}
{"text":"Cody and Chris are amazing..Cody is always my server due to his impeccable attention to details.  He knows what I like and and his service never falls short of perfection..thank you Cody for being the smiling face at the end of my day."}
{"text":"We went to this location for lunch. The server was very personable and helpful. I ordered the pork slider and my husband had the hamburger sliders. The pork on  my slider had the texture of mush, and it had little or no sauce. It tasted like the meat was old. My husband hamburgers were thin and over cooked to the point  of being burned. The French fries had no flavor at all. I think they came out of  an oven not a fryer. The lemonade was great. The really bad part of this meal was  the cost of $26.00 plus tip for a meal we could not eat. I think the owner of this restaurant needs to spend some time in the kitchen. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"If you get the wrong wings don't bother in asking for the correct ones. We ordered honey bbq and they came out honey hot. We told our server,  kindly,  that they were wrong and less than 5 min later we received what we were told were honey bbq. What they really did was excessively coat the honey hot with bbq sauce. Like my mouth wouldn't know the difference....hello --on fire.  (Sorry I don't have much tolerance for hot...) the server did his best,  I blame management for thinking they could pass them off. We didn't complain because we didn't want to be more of a pain. We'll come back, but needless to say this visit didn't fill our appetites. Everyone has a bad day,  we get it..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wings delisc. Staff friendly n great service.  Love sitting at bar where windows open."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in a long time.  Waited 45 minutes for our food and it was cold when it finally came out.  The managers blamed it on a party of 100 and a party of 60.  We overheard another employee give much lower numbers.  I walked around and it sure didn't look like 160 people split between 2 parties.  If you are going to make excuses at least get your numbers correct (and be smart enough to realize the person you are lying to can walk around to check your numbers).  He explained that they were slammed with these huge parties at 4 pm.  We were there at 7 pm.  Nice try.  When I asked why he didn't call in extra servers if he had known about the huge parties since 4 pm he had no reply. To top it off he only took 25% off the bill.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went there last night around 10pm. Wasn't too busy placed our order and got our appetizer 20 min later, the table behind us which arrived after us received their entire meal before us we sat there for another 20 min & still didn't have our food which was only a small pizza & stripper plater. Our server was unconcerned and didn't apologize for the inconvenience she continuously walked by us but never said anything or apologized for the wait. We come here all the time & very disappointed in last night visit. We paid for a half eaten chicken ranch flatbread and left."}
{"text":"I have worked in the restaurant industry for 4 years now and recently went through management training. I take a lot of pride in the business as I know its my job to give my guest the best experience whether its a quick bite to eat, first date, anniversary, birthday...etc. Tonight I went in to celebrate my brother in laws birthday with my family. Morgan was our server. Right off the bat I figured she may have been new considering when we asked for the drafts she had to scramble through the menus to find the list of beers. My brother in law had a chance to list the beers for us before she did.The birthday boy asked for a vodka tonic with two limes. She repeated it back and he specified I want two limes! She came back with two vodka tonics and one lime... hey, we all make mistakes! then came out the wrong size beer... oh boyy.... We ordered our food which came out fairly quick. My 7 year old nephew asked for a native burger and received sliders... As they were setting down the food we told the other server helping we didn't order sliders, we are waiting on a hamburger. Instead of listening she interrupted and told us that there were suppose to be one order or sliders not two... NO ma'am, we are trying to tell you we didn't order sliders at all.... she then began to tell us yes we ordered sliders not a hamburger. He had to tell her 4 times that we know we never ordered the sliders.You should have already stopped and listened to the guess and apologized for the mix up and fixed it. My brother in law asked for the roast beef sandwich that was suppose to have horseradish on it but didn't. A lady, whom I am assuming was the manager, brought out the burger and asked if we needed anything else. My brother in law asked if his sandwich was suppose to have horseradish on it.... She said \"yeah, but a lot of people don't like it so we didn't put it on\" Shouldn't you be serving the food that is listed on the menu as it comes??? We also had three cups, an empty beer glass, an empty bar glass, and numerous dishes that sat on our table all night. I was so happy to pre-bus my own table and stack my empty dishes for my server as I dinned in.   The best part was being able to witness our server exchange a few words with another co-worker by the POS system behind the host stand, which happens to be in direct view from our table. There is nothing like eating and watching your server talk crap about your table to another server, then watch the other server stare at you as you are being talked about.   The solution that could of fixed all of this was a simply apology or understanding about our frustrations from our dine in experience. To see some what of damage control or kindness from the manager who didn't care to resolve any of the issues would have been nice. A manager should have touched our table as soon as the server knew we were frustrated. The manager also should have followed up and tried to make sure their guest left happy. I understand there are a lot of things in a restaurant that fall out of control. I understood the first initial things that happened. But you DO NOT talk about your guest, especially where they can see you. You also shouldn't try and tell them they are wrong.   Thank you Native for the experience and new pre-shifts topics for my servers so we can make sure our guest will never experience such negligence   TREAT YOUR GUEST RIGHT OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL!"}
{"text":"Service was the worse! Sat down for 10 mins and was never acknowledge by a waiter or a server. Not even so much as a soft drink or \"I will be right with you.\" All of the waiters were huddled up together talking like there was not any customers in the building! What made it even worse the same girl who took us to our seats 10 minutes prior,  just said thanks and come again while she was on her phone. Too bad she did not pay attention when we left, because she might have seen that we were just there and now walking out."}
{"text":"Angela, the day time bartender is so very good.  She remembers your name, what you drink, and what you ate last.  Food is always good. I've never been disappointed going to this Native.  I believe they have the best wings anywhere.  Add some tater tots and your there!!!"}
{"text":"Had a few beers and wings... Worst service I have had in a long time! The bartender completely ignored us and was more worried about the single guy at the end of the bar. The manager was loud and kept talking about things that customers should never hear (like how much petty cash they have on hand). We go to Native in Glendale and have great service, was seriously surprised at the lack of service here. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wings! Something like 1750 calories alone for a dozen, but worth every one. Their salads aren't healthy at all either, but then again, no one realistically comes here to eat anything but greasy fried things. It seems like every time I come here, there's 50 children running around screaming. Parents- control your spoiled rugrats in public or please find a babysitter. Especially at a place that's half wing joint half sports bar. Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"This location for wings and other food has gone down.  It seems like they have gone to lower quality food.  Last time I was there the boneless wings tasted like dirty dish water, I had to send them back.  I completely lost my appetite after that. www.Myphoenixareahomes.com"}
{"text":"I think they are very confused. Are you a bar or a family dine in resteraunt? If you are a bar, turn the speakers up for the games so I can't hear the people's conversation sitting next to me. If you are dine in, you have a lot of work to do on your food. We ordered wings and they came back extremely dry. The guy brought them back and slathered on cold wing sauce. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love to watch the Cards games here Alyssa is the best server good wings cold beer and awesome atmosphere for kids and adults alike"}
{"text":"Good wings here visiting from Cali I remember my friend Deann raving about this place when I lived in phoenix back in 1997...great service waitress was awesome and sweet Wings were yummy live the strawberry hot surprisingly good. Can't go wrong with mango habanero with a side of blue cheese Cheese pizza was very cheesy and tasty Will be back again great happy hour deals as well"}
{"text":"7/10/2016 3:02 pm  Worst service. Hate to leave bad comments and I never do but I have to.... Sat in the bar side, was not busy but slow steady... Took 10 minutes to be greeted, 30 minutes to receive our appetizer, and 40 minutes for wings!!!!!  Ridiculous. Love the wings and the food, come here somewhat often and this has been the worst visit.  server at the bar should pay more attention to guests. And we sat right next to the bar so we were not at a hidden table."}
{"text":"Our group was originally told the wait would be 15 minutes for an indoor table. After 10 minutes we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. After 10 more minutes we were told the wait was still 30 minutes. There seemed to be many open tables but we instead went outside where there was one bartender/server in charge of the entire (very large) area.  We then ordered our food immediately and it took over 2 hours to receive our food that came out lukewarm. By far this was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally decided to try this place yesterday. We will never go back. The food was not good. My husband's calzone was tasteless and too much bread and not enough fillings. I ordered a burger and fries and the fries were undercooked and the burger very greasy. I felt ill the rest of the night. However, we did have good service and the beer was very cold, but still won't go back."}
{"text":"Not great.  Was hoping to like this place since they appear to have great happy hour deals and a good environment for catching games on TV, but our food came out cold and bland.  At least it's another chain that I can cross off of my \"chains I've never been to\" list."}
{"text":"The pineapple teriyaki wings are great, the honey hot flavor is awesome, but the bar is not always clean as it could be. I hate traveling to the one in Ahwatukee because I'm ALWAYS the only minority there and I tend to get a bit scared all by minority lonesome. I've visited this location a few times and it's never as clean as the one in Ahwatukee. Serious SAD FACE!"}
{"text":"Usually I get wings here, and they are always good. Last time I went I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries, and it was much better than expected. Not that I expected to be bad or anything, so it was that good."}
{"text":"I went here on a Weds night with my son before seeing a movie next door. The restaurant was active but not \"busy\"-lots of tables open. We stood at the front door for at least 10 minutes without seeing a hostess, manager-anyone to seat us. I finally decided to seat ourselves in the bar area-which was fine but not my first choice with a 12 year old. It took another 15 minutes for a server/bartender to acknowledge us and take our order-I would have understood if the bar tables were packed but there were at least 8+ open tables. We just came in for wings-seemed to me to be a simple order. It took another 35 minutes at least to get our food-not one stop by from a server or the bartender during this time-I would have gotten another drink. I had to go up the bar myself to ask for a refill for my son as well as ask for the status on our food and then the bill. I am giving 2 stars because the food was good but the service was very much lacking. I am not one to give bad reviews but we were so disappointed that night I had to share. No one apologized for the food wait or service the entire time."}
{"text":"I use to love coming here all the time, it's one of the few places I could order different things on the menu and love it. Never afraid to try something new here but coming back to visit from Vegas I was at first shocked to find parking up close on a Saturday and when looking at the menu they drastically raised the prices to the point it wasn't even really worth it even tho the wings are amazing so sadly we just left. Almost $13 for 12 wings they also changed the 8 wings order to 6 wings and raised the price."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was bad. Waitress brought out my item but forgot to place the order for the other person with me. When she corrected her mistake the wrong item was brought out. Finally got the correct item but took it home. When we got the bill it was wrong. Got the one item free but the whole meal should of been free. First and last time. Too bad because the food was good."}
{"text":"So happy to have this back in surprise. Food is always great. Service is awesome. They have a great lunch menu that flows into happy hour during the week. They also give military discount and have a great mural for Luke Air Force Base in the bar. Ask for the beer if the month!!!"}
{"text":"Went into this location last night (9/11/16) in the bar side for some football, food and beers. We started off with one server who was pretty good, however my boyfriends burger tasted like it was drenched in salt and completely unedible we told her, she apologized and that was it. I ordered Chickens stripers which tasted chewy and hard.. almost as if they were reheated  very nasty. The first server was leaving so she let us know that we would be taken care of someone else named Veronica.... who upon arriving to our table seen my plate had not been touched and off to the side, she asked if I didn't like it I told her what was wrong and she had it removed from our bill and offered to bring me something else, I declined. She seemed to be the only waitress working last night she seriously was hustling, she was running around like crazy and we still NEVER had an empty glass despite her having every table in the place full and taking care of them all alone. There was one other waitress with reddish hair who was just pacing back and forth not really even do anything at all. Once the game was over I noticed her trying to leave for the night while Veronica was cleaning all the tables, cashing people out and still making sure we were taken care of.... the girl with the reddish hair just seemed like she didn't want to be there and wanted to leave asap...  Overall aside from the terrible strippers and burger Service from Veronica was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the third time in a row we've come to this place and walked out after waiting 10+ minutes for a server to take our drink orders (or even acknowledge that we're there). It wasn't even busy this time! The staff was just standing around near the wait station ten feet from us and somehow ignored our party of five. The food isn't anything special, but in light of the horrible service I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give 1/2 stars.   I visited this afternoon with my husband and son. Drinks at least came quickly. We ordered asiago cheese chips (the only decent part of the meal for me) and the server tried to walk away before my husband could order his suicide wings.   ***Side note #1. Someone that finds jalapenos hot, should not be able to comfortably finish a suicide wing. It was hot, but the Heart Attack at Yen Sushi is hotter.  Instead of clearing the empty dishes first, she came out with a tray, and rather than coming the extra 3 feet around the table, held my Kummelweck sandwich in my face across the table until I took it.  ***Side note #2. Holding a bun under tap water and smooching seeds with regular salt on it prior to serving, is not the way to make a Kummelweck bun. I can understand the bottom of the bun being already disintegrated from the beef holding water and spilled Ah Jus when I got the plate, but the top bun should not only not be cold and soggy, my hand shouldn't look covered in wet sand after I put it down.   ***Side note #3. Au Jus should not have more grease than broth.  I'd requested a salad, which wasn't brought out with dinner. The leaves were slimy, the tomato was rotten and the cheese looked like it had been living there for a few days.   My sons sliders meal was ok. At least this time you could see the meat on the sandwich. My husbands burger was ok, but didn't feel so hot afterwords.    The only positive point from this experience was the asiago cheese chips.  Lack luster, lazy server, plus substandard food. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"A depressing collision of bad food and worse service. Food served cold and salted beyond being able to consume. The service was worse.  Most of the time I had to get up and wander the restaurant to find our server. This seemed to be the norm here, as none of the servers seemed to want to help. There are several other restaurants in this area. Go to any of them."}
{"text":"Liz is a super attentive waitress! Even offered suggestions on flavors. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I am rating this restaurant with 1 star, but it deserves none. Everything we ordered was bland. The wings had very little sauce, the ranch was watery and tasteless. The chicken was unseasoned and previously frozen. The pizza was equivalent to Chuck-E-Cheese in taste and quality. The calzone and pizza dough had obviously been previously frozen. The calzone and pizza crust were dry, As an actual native New Yorker, my fellow New Yorkers would be as disgusted with the food as my wife and I were. We did not send anything back for its poor quality. We didn't see the point. We were hungry and did not want to wait for anything else, especially since other items must be of similar low quality. We ate what we could, paid, and left.  The bathrooms smelled horrible. The service was mediocre.  All in all, a VERY disappointing experience. We will NOT be going back again."}
{"text":"Have been back on many occasions now and they have really turned things around.  Service is great, the staff really makes you feel welcome.  Food is delicious, I highly recommend the buffalo nachos appetizer.  As stated above, they have really turned things around."}
{"text":"Horrible service, they need to also put a sign up saying only bar area is open even if the kitchen is open. This location closes at midnight. We went to this location at 9pm and the dining area was closed even though there was people seated and eating. I've been here occasionally before and only see staff when they take my order and give me my bill. They don't even serve me the cook does. I'm a generous tipper but sad to only tip them 20% cause service is that bad. I go to the location on Gilbert and the 60. They actually let us in along with others and even though it was crazy busy they still did an amazing job. That waitress had a good night."}
{"text":"I love native ' s wings!!!!  The place was not that busy but after waiting around for quite some time without being recognized, we had to seat ourselves and wait a while longer to be greeted and receive menus.   Today the customer service was horrible!  We came in less than 10 minutes before happy hour and the waitress ASHLEY acted as tho we couldn't place an order at all before happy hour, half of our order wasn't even apart of the 3pm discounted items.  She shorted me on my change and over charged me on my order. A person who was with me overheard her gossiping about the inconvenience for having to reprint my receipt and take our order before 3pm.    We all left irritated!  But the Honey Hot wings are Bomb.com. they came out fresh and saucy!"}
{"text":"Wings and no beer...how sad is this picture. Been waiting for over ten mins now. I really hope it gets better cause it was not this bad before"}
{"text":"we have been going there since we came back to AZ..love it... everybody in the stuff is really nice and Christy will go out of her way to help you...the BEST... she is our favorite"}
{"text":"Last week was our first visit to Native.  Our waiter, Austin, was friendly and courteous, and my Asian salad was good.  From there it went downhill very fast.    The table was grimy to start out with which grossed us out. Our food took thirty minutes to come out, and people who had arrived after us had already gotten their food.  Then, my dad's lemon and pepper hand rubbed wings were dried out, had only five blades and one little drumstick and were super super salty.  We were in a hurry since our food took so long, so he was just going to go ahead and eat them, even though he didn't really like them.   Austin came by and offered to switch out the last two, which my dad appreciated.  He then came back a couple minutes later and said he wasn't allowed to switch them out, and BROUGHT THE OLD WINGS BACK!   We then asked for the manager.  This manager, NATE, came and had the WORST customer service I've experienced in a long time.  He was not polite, and he told my dad why he wasn't switching out the two measly legs.  How rude and how ridiculous.  It's sad that he lost probably a whole network of people's business, and gave us a poor impression of his leadership skills over a couple hot wings.    I'm a leadership consultant, and I would recommend hiring new management to the owner. We commend Austin for trying to do good customer service in an environment where his leadership (from our experience) does not seem to care about the customer.  My family and I don't ever want to eat at Native again due to this unpleasant experience that kept me up that night thinking about how disappointing and frustrating it was."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and had no problems, but this passed Sunday when I came here, the waitress (don't remember her name) gave me & my family a rude attitude & dirty looks (as if we were bothering her). She only came to our table about twice & wasn't paying any attention to us (when we needed refills, napkins, etc.). The place was so cold our food got cold fast, fruit flys (gnats, whatever they're called) were flying everywhere, some even landed in our food. It was just the most uncomfortable place to eat in, knowing there's little flys flying everywhere hoping it doesn't land in your food or hair, they're so tiny, we would have to pick at our food to make sure nothing was in it. The second time our waitress came to us (when we were about ready to pay & leave) we told her what happened to our food & how uncomfortable we were eating because of the flys, she called her manager over & when he came, he told us \"oh you should've told me sooner\" with no apology or anything. Not the type of response I was hoping to get. Don't plan on eating here ever again!"}
{"text":"Cool sports bar. Even family friendly. Not too loud and no wait for 2 people on a busy Saturday night with college FB on. Decent draft beer and menu item prices. Got our food quickly. Will return."}
{"text":"Bottom line: great service, great food, and great specials.  I'm a big wing and beer guy, and both of these were prompt, cheap, and delicious. Not that many beers on tap, but they have imports as well as domestics and a few locals from San Tan Brewery. The wings....oh, the wings. $0.69 per wing, $0.39 on Tuesday and Thursdays! No extra charge for ranch, which always irks me when restaurants do it. The Pizza is great too, NY style. About $12 for a medium which is more than enough for two people. Beer was $6 for a 24oz stein of XX, less for domestics and $1 off after 10pm. Don't come here expecting to drink red wine, they only have Black Opal and another cheap brand on the menu.  The service is great. NNY has managers and servers bussing food, so you won't wait long for your food. There's no rush to get out, even on a busy night, which is a nice change from the usual restaurant hustle and bustle. They comp'd us a few extra wings to try a different flavor, which was nice.  The food and drink specials are good, and there's a different one every night. Check it out on a weekday night before 7 or after 10 to take advantage of the specials and the wings, or come in for dinner and feed the whole family with their pizzas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually just order the chicken salads from here. They are our go to when we can't decide what to eat. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because when we decide to order something different, it tends to be a miss or some of our order is messed up. Tonight we got our salads and decided to try the BBQ Pork Sliders, yuck. We also got honey bbq wings and my boyfriend tasted one and with a funny look on his face said \"I think they are honey bbq..\" If you guys like Chicken salads, go for it! ( We like adding a hard  boiled egg to ours.)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this one in quite a while and now it's all coming back to me!  Salad was over priced, chicken strippers weren't battered all the way and were cold, fries were way under portioned. Fries are cheap to make, what's the issue???? Won't be back again, definitely picking a different location. Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Wings were abnormally small. We've been here several times in the past few months. The wings today were half the size that they normally are. Consequently we opted not to order anymore... They did this a couple years ago, on Father's day. We stopped coming for over a year... Kind of a shame..."}
{"text":"I am highly disappointed with the service I had. I had to wait literally 26the minutes after I was finished eating my food for the server to bring my check. And I had to ask for it! He was too concerned about the party he was being sat rather than take care of us. I will come back, because I get good service every other time I go, but this time I was overly frustrated."}
{"text":"If I could give this place half a star I would. First off, I went here on a Friday night expecting to have a good dinner. The server wanted us to rush and order our food because I guess the kitchen was going to close. So my girlfriend and I are rushing to order food. I ordered an 18 pack of TRADITIONAL WINGS half hot, half habanero mango. While ppl are walking in our server is too lazy and anxious to leave this place that she's telling customers the place is closed when in fact the bar was still open..so she didn't specify that maybe they can still have a drink but that ONLY the kitchen was closing. Anyway, after a while they bring out our food and what do I get? Half hot and half fu***ng FRIED BREADED CHICKEN WINGS!!!!!! No sauce whatsoever!!! So I nicely ask our server to bring me sauce because my wings were completely dry!!! What I was completely pissed off about was that she did not specify whether I wanted breaded bone in wings or what we are all used to seeing TRADITIONAL WINGS THAT ARE NOT BREADED!!!! I mean I haven't ever been to native wings or whatever the name of the restaurant is now so isn't it your job as a server to tell the customer that your damn wings are breaded!?!?! Once again I asked her if all of Natives wings are breaded and she replied \"You have to ask for them to not be breaded\"...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? How about you do your JOB and advise customers whether they want their wings breaded or not!!!!! So here I am eating breaded chicken wings and not able to order anymore wings because their damn kitchen is \"closed\"...bs man...spent, more like threw away $40 in the garbage because my girlfriend too disliked their chicken sandwich that was soggy as sh*t because of how much sauce they put on it...this place needs better servers to inform customers of what their food really has..so pissed off I wasted my money on horrible breaded chicken wings when I could've spent it elsewhere. Terrible experience at Native..."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  Sat on the patio and was chased inside by smoke.  Sat inside bar as far from patio \"smoking area\" as possible and smoke simply wafted into the bar area from patrons smoking within feet of patio entrance and an open patio wall.  Smoke was bad enough that it irritated our eyes and lungs.  Complained to manager who turned on \"smoke curtain\" which was theoretically supposed to stop the smoke from entering the building.  Either it was never actually turned on or was simply ineffective. When we asked for the manager again she responded to us by saying \"you again\".  Stated our complaint, paid the check and left congested and smelling like smoke.  Great place if your a smoker, like smelling like smoke and breathing in other peoples second hand smoke.  If you like to dine and have cocktails in a clean air environment pick someplace else."}
{"text":"Went last night about 9 pm. Got seated in the bar, and I was planning on trying an Atlantic Breeze drink to start. I was thinking wings too. After 10 minutes and no visit by the waitress I assumed they werent interested in making money on a saturday. It wasn't busy, I could see the servers and hostess chatting , the the bartender chatting with some other servers. Got up and left. I'm sure I'll go again though, I do love their wings."}
{"text":"Had a great time Saturday night celebrating my Mom's 75th Birthday! The entire staff was friendly and accommodating. Jenny did an amazing job taking care of our group!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location needs an upgrade. This location was not appealing. Decided quickly to not eat here and rather eat at a different location across the street. Not giving up on Native though. Peace!"}
{"text":"New York style pizza?  I think not!  Haven't been in awhile so thought I would order take out...big mistake.  The bottom was thin, but soggy and the crust had this big, non New York chewy crust that tasted like refrigerated pizza crust.  Really skimpy on the toppings, too.  Considering the cost for what was in the box, no more take out from NNN for us!  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"RUN!!!!   RUN!!!!   RUN!!!   DO NOT EAT at this location!!!!   NASTY!!!!!  I did love the wings from Native but after what I got tonight I will never eat here again. This is the first time I have gotten from this location and I am so grossed out I almost puked. The wings were like they were cooked days before with no sauce, placed under a heat lamp, then finally (5 days later) had sauce spooned over them and served. 50.00 dollars worth of chicken is now sitting in my trash can instead of my family's bellies."}
{"text":"They have changed their wing recipe, they now bread all of their wings. This is very disappointing, a real buffalo wing is never breaded. If I wanted breaded wings I would suffer through the horrible wings at Hooters. Corporate get your act together and go back to how they have been made for the last 25 years!"}
{"text":"4 stars, as each represent a quarter, and at Native you get more bang for your buck, the Staff is flawless, specifically Luke, Breenna, Ari, and Adrianna, my personal favorite 4 stars, my review today is specific to Luke, he was the bartender the day I visited, he created an environment of contagious enthusiasm that may be imitated but never duplicated, Luke lent me a warm welcome, that exemplifies what Native represents, Authenticity,  Quality , uniqueness, fairness, and their commitment to excellence, Luke is a customer service oriented person, whom reflects in his service His commitment to excellence, specifically, on this day, I witnessed Luke getting verbally assaulted by a customer, for something out of Luke's control, What I can testify to is Luke took complete ownership, he acknowledged the customers concerned, addressed the customers concerned and did it all with a sincerely empathic attitude, when I sat down to place my order with Luke, the verbal abuse that he just endured was not reflected, almost as if he has a \"reset button\" where as, he did not make me pay for the recent occurrence, Luke placed his everlasting smile , looked at me and after greeting me, gladly took my order, He was accurate,  friendly and provided the status of my order, I was beyond impressed with his professionalism, attitude and his unique style, I will return often, because the food is great,  but even better with Luke, ..as he has somehow found the secret to success, that while he Bartends he does not work a day in his life, his hospitality, I would compare to that of a Best friend, of the 4 stars in rate today, I double it and lay it down...to represent my satisfaction,  thank you Luke"}
{"text":"We had a rough dining experience there once. The management was very responsive and worked hard to make it better. Very good food. Nice environment, especially on the patio. I liked the naked wings, and my wife liked the cookie dessert. Ramone the manager was very kind and dedicated. McKenzie was a very nice waitress."}
{"text":"This place... Wow! Worst wings I've ever had. It's just this location though. The one on Litchfield and Waddell in Surprise, is excellent as far as food and customer service go.  To start, everything was fine. Friendly servers and hostess. Good appetizer and food was brought out on time.  Then... We took a bite of our wings. Absolutely, hands down the worst chicken wings I have ever had in my life.   Sparrow wings... Is that what the wings are from? A sparrow? Because they were so small and badly overcooked there was nothing to even eat.  When we complained the manager didn't seem to give too much of a crap and told us  if we didn't like it that he would have to charge us again to put in a new order.  He was rude, unprofessional and seemed bothered by our complaint that was totally warranted because of the terrible meal we received. We didn't want a refund. We just wanted our food to be cooked the right way and not over fried by like 6 minutes. It was awful. We will not be returning here. The bar seemed to be the main concern or reason people were there. Clean place, awful food service. Had we went to get trashed and sat at the bar, my review would more than likely express a different opinion. Point being... This is a bar AND GRILL. But it's clearly evident that the grill is not a priority what so ever"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here weekly and are treated like family. The customer service is just outstanding and everyone is so friendly. We would also like to thank Angelique for exceptional service. My husband likes the traditional wings but I really enjoy the grilled, skinless wings; very tasty. We highly recommend this Native Grill for their exceptional service and great food."}
{"text":"I actually live in buckeye and close to native but will travel to this location, quality of food is way better and Cynthia Rogers always takes good care of us!!!"}
{"text":"We recently came in with our 16 month old, waited over 30 mins for our appetizers, over an hour for our food to come out. We eventually called the manager and told her we no longer want the order and would like to leave. The baby was past him time being out and we were extremely frustrated. The place wasn't busy at all so we have up. The manager Beverley, hooked us up with 2 food vouchers and have us our food to go for free. Her kindness was appreciated and for that, and only that, we will be back."}
{"text":"Not satisfied after ordering to-go for lunch today!!! I have never been to a Native grill before and thought I would try it out. I had my 6-month old baby with me and we were hoping to get Togo to head on out to enjoy AZ since we are on vacation here. Right as we entered the restaurant, I received a very sad almost bored \"Hi\" from the hostess. That was it. I asked to order for takeout and she immediately asked what I wanted to order without offering me the menu. I had to ask for a menu and quickly ordered a Greek chicken salad with flatbread and 6 lemon pepper wings. The hostess gave off the vibe that she wasn't too thrilled to be here on a Saturday afternoon. After waiting for almost 20mins for the food to arrive and listening to the workers gossip at the front about the working staff, I hurried back to our hotel without checking the food. Got back and opened my salad to find just a plain Greek salad, NO Chicken, and flatbread as hard as tortilla chips.  Needless to say, I was not impressed or satisfied by my experience here, and am not coming back. On a side note, chicken wings tasted fine, but can't beat the wings at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Two stars, mainly for really attentive service from a friendly staff.  We ordered boneless honey barbecue wings, a favorite of ours for years from other Native New Yorker locations. They were barely warm, had a really unappealing texture and the sauce was almost flavorless...definitely not what we were used to and have looked forward to over the years."}
{"text":"Horrible experience indeed! Hostile server named Angelique and incompetent Mgmt staff unable to control the situation. 5 of us sitting at the bar and were told to \"scoot in\" as we were in violation of the fire code. Mind you we were the only patrons in entire restaurant bar area. After the Mgr apologized for her rude behavior a frustrated Angelique came back and unleashed all of her unhappiness upon us. She defined unprofessional. Over the years we have been to the Native probably 50 times to watch football on Sunday's and never have they pulled the \"fire hazard card\" even when exceeding  OSHA limits. Top that off with Burned Tater Tots.....we will never return. Not another dime ever. Never thanks to Angelique and Mgmt staff not confident in their ability to handle an employee situation. Felt like I was in Kohls."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for a server to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. Also we waited an extra 10 minutes for our drinks to come in and waited more than 40 minutes for our food to come in. DONT COME HERE. Worst service I have ever experienced would not recommend to anyone. We waited for more than 30 minutes for the check. They also screwed up our order and still charged what they screwed up. DONT COME HERE!!"}
{"text":"This company has lost it's mind. $14 for a dozen hotwings? Hah.  @Business Owner  Nah I think I will just stick with the Woodshed 2 on University and Dobson. Amazing wings. Also since your name change (not sure if new ownership) but your brand has suffered here.   I started eating at native in the mid 80s.  I did stop in to have a sandwich for lunch when some friends. IMO the portions were very small for the price. There are better places to eat.  Good luck though!"}
{"text":"We just moved to AZ a week ago and we already found our fave new waitress. Christy at the Goodyear restaurant is amazing. She made the already food food better by making suggestions and making sure my kiddo was smiling. We all enjoyed our food but we loved Christy and will be back to see her!!"}
{"text":"WORSE SERVICES EVER!!  The waiter Jenny or Jamie whatever her name is rude... The waiter Paige not that great either.  We were standing at the door for about five minutes. No one came so we sit ourselves down. The waiter jenny or Jamie don't really remember her name. Anyways, she asked us \"did you guys just sit yourself?\"  My answer yeah no one was at the door and we waited for awhile. After she went to the back and pointed at our table made a face like they didn't want to take our order... Later the waiters Paige came and took our order. That was the last we seen of her. Never came back to give us refills or our food order. Only took our order and give us our bill.   I never really complain about places cause I myself am a waiter. And I understand when it gets busy. But this place wasn't busy at all and it was at night. And still had the worse services in my life. Never will I go back.  This native New Yorker doesn't even deserve a star.   Here's a tip for the management: Work on your staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The shredded pork queso is the bomb! Food portions are large and tasty. Service needs to improve. Though we were immediately seated, we waited for quite a while to order. The server also brought us the wrong drink and forgot our carrots for the wings. Service can mean the difference in a dining experience."}
{"text":"WARNING! My rating is based off the wings and beer. Nothing else on the menu.    I was a big hooters fan, but when I moved here, everyone said try this place for wings, and I did and they are great! The best ones are the honey hot wings.  I love coming here for football games tons of flat screens everywhere and happy hour is great 22oz of blue moon for $3 bucks cannot beat that price!    By the way do not get the pizza it is really awful, I suggest NYPD for NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I came to this place just to catch some wings nothing extraordinary we thought. We had a coupon since my husband and I moved in the area not long ago.  I just gotta say that service was out of this orbit great. Since we opened the door the manager that was leaving for the day greeted and welcomed us very friendly. And then the server was nothing but sweet and checked up on us regularly instead of abandoning us. The manager also came and checked the table and at the end the server pre bussed the table promptly for us to enjoy a little time after dinner instead of leaving us with our plates all dirty. I got a wedge salad and some wings. My husband got a Philly steak. We were really pleased. Great prices too. :) we will be back. Thank you Sami. We will definitely look for your station whenever we make it back."}
{"text":"The manger didnt want to a accept a federal ID we decided to leave and not give or money to this location really unprofessional will make a report with the location license and their liquor license if I could give them a negative points I would probably wont be going here anytime soon until.I.get I legit apologize from the manger and the top ppl of.native new york"}
{"text":"The food is good. But wow the service here is TERRIBLE. They got our order wrong but we told the girl at the counter politely that she had forgotten something and she got a horrible attitude with us.   She and the other employees there started smirking and laughing and makinh my fiance anf I very uncomfortable. The servers there's were hiding behind menus and texting, ignoring the customers sitting down.  NEVER going back there again."}
{"text":"I love Native!  This isn't my go to location (even though I'm literally doen the street). This particular location delivers sub par service with great food. My family and I always order the spinach artichoke dip for starters, and it is delicious! Back in the day when it was Native New Yorker, portions used to be much larger than they are now and they offered 39 cent bone-in wings every Tuesday/Thursday. That has changed now unfortunately. I would not recommend this particular location as a first pick based on service alone. I would pick the Native on Estrella Pkwy, Litchfield/Waddell, or the Glendale location over this one. The food is pretty much the same no matter what location you go to IMO."}
{"text":"It is the closest sports bar, so when playoff time rolls around I have to get my fix. But wait, I'm a Red Sox fan. Whatever, I went in anyways not really caring for rivalries. I didn't notice an overwhelming New York vibe or anything, just a table full of hooligans in the booth next to us. I was somewhat amused by the company logo upon looking at the menu. Expecting a gangster Yankee theme, it was humbly a chicken riding a buffalo.  Our server was extremely pleasant, although perhaps had her hands full with the table next to us. My beer ran out and sat there arid for some time, whether that means I have a problem or not it was still a slight buzz kill. I began with 6 Wings and then dived into a Skyscraper Burger- which was absolutely delicious! Being one of the largest items on the menu I had to tackle it due to the nature of my appetite. Although pricey, the Burger is probably worth it and the wings were solid. Massive TV's are everywhere, and it is a very comfortable setting... I liked it and will probably go in again for the upcoming season."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch,as I noticed this location just opened. The service was great'as was our pizza.the decor was cool.lots of t.v.'s and very  clean.the only thing that I didn't like was the overzealous managers coming to our table asking us if everything's o.k. several times by several different managers.ANNOYING!!!!! We also could hear them yelliing at their employees while they were in the kitchen.very unprofessional.felt bad for our server because she did an excellent job,but her managers were  loudly barkimg orders at her'and everyone else there.geesh! Glad I don't work there. Id probally come back for pizza sometime,but don't like to frequent establishments tjat treat their workers  poorly so  I doubt i'd become a regular."}
{"text":"Food was awesome !!! Service was horrible from bartender and the restaurant was dead for a Sunday. The manager checked on us more than our server."}
{"text":"Love 2ing nights. Best wing I think in the valley. Calzonz are also good. Love all the waiters."}
{"text":"My father ordered a salad. First the lettuce was wilted, then there was no chicken. When the chicken finally arrived it was spoiled and smelt terrible. They were very mindful of the whole situation and took the salad off our bill. Just don't order a salad."}
{"text":"My first time at Native and it was awesome!! Food was great!! Our servers Kerri and Dave were excellent.  Kerri was a hoot!  Love servers with a personality.   Dave took our order without writing anything down and our order was perfect.  Hope to come back before I head back home to Texas!"}
{"text":"New bartender can't stop foul mouthed.  Not pleasant for kids. Second time with new one may be last."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Went for the advertised Sunday wing special price deal only to be told it was a dine in price only. That detail is not mentioned any where. The girl in there told me there was no way to enter that in the computer as a take out order. I need to mention that there was only a few cars outside, the place was basically empty. Needless to say I will not be going there again. Doesn't even deserve the one star but it wouldn't let me post without a star rating!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Beer and Wings only people! Ordered a pizza from them for the 1st time tonight. Had company coming over and needed a Vegetarian Pizza. Wifey said I couldn't go with Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. I considered Oregano's, Nellos which I have had before and enjoyed but stupid me decided to try a new place when company was coming over. Ordered an 18\"  Veggie/Feta special. BLAH. The crust tasted and had the texture of day old bread and the toppings were not done well at all. At close to $25 this was a HUGE disapointment. I will go back for Happy Hour beer and wings but would NEVER order another pizza from NNY."}
{"text":"Management has the most ridiculous program for seating customers. They purposely make you wait to be seated even though there are plenty of tables available. When we asked why they do that we were told that it is so the kitchen doesn't get behind. Are you kidding?!?  I have never heard anything so stupid. We watched people leave bc they didn't want to wait. Guess the kitchen won't get behind that way!    Seriously, seat people right away. Take their drink order. If, and only if, the kitchen happens to get behind, let the customer know and apologize for the dealt. No big deal. Anything else is stupid.    There are always other options. When you treat customers poorly they will find those options.   Once you do get seated the wait staff is very pleasant, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened with this place. We've been coming here for years, but after tonight, we will not be back.   Placed an order for wings to go & asked for extra sauce. I get home & instead of extra sauce, it looks there is no sauce at all. This is the 2nd time in a row they have done this. I called to complain & the so called manager told me he put together my order himself & they were saucy.   I really wish I knew how to post a picture with my review, but I don't. There was no sauce on them & it was definitely not \"saucy\".   I will not be going back & if I want wings, I will find another place because their's aren't that great in the first place."}
{"text":"I had never tried this place before and really wanted wings for dinner. Buffalo Wild Wings was closed so we came here instead. I was very happy with that decision.   The service was great and our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful, and patient. We order 1 pound of boneless wings and it was a ton! The prices are incredible and when the chicken came out, they were nice and covered in sauce and all white meat. The flavors were extremely tasty and distinct.   I will definitely be returning and recommending this over bdubs to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Gross. We just moved to Gilbert last summer and had yet to try Native Wings. We only had BWW where we moved from so we were pretty excited to try this place. I am still apologizing to my family for making them eat this stuff. The \"garden salad\" was a big bowl of soggy, brown, wilted, bagged lettuce with shredded mozzarella cheese (clearly the same cheese used on their pizza) and tiny little microscopic pieces of tomatoes. Where's the garden in that?? The pizza was undercooked, soggy, the cheese wasn't even fully melted, yet somehow managed to have a burnt cheese taste. The wings were dry, cracked, and lacked flavor no matter what type of sauce or rub was on them. We had 4 varieties and none were good. Totally disappointed in this place, will look for other wing options. UPDATE......the manager asked that we give Native another chance so we did. This time we just had the wings and fries and they were great! We got a 6 piece Stripper with honey BBQ and Teriyaki Ginger,  1 lb of boneless with 4 different flavors and fries on the side. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the fries were crispy and fresh. The server we had tonight was great, just like our last one so they definitely do not have any issues in customer service to address, even the host was super friendly and said hello and goodbye to everyone. I would most definitely recommend to others, thank you Native!"}
{"text":"The service was way below average!  We had a large party but we should not have to get our own menus and flag down a bus boy to get the waitress to take our drink orders 15 min after being seated. Requests for condiments,  drink refills, and napkins for a spilled beer the waitress mishandled were repeatedly requested. The cherry on top, was when one of our party members asked if the tip was already added to all our tickets to clarify the 18% gratuity and the waitress tried to tell her the gratuity is not the tip and she can add the tip as well. I asked for a manager and the manager came over with attitude to state, \"I hear someone is upset about the gratuity..\" This place has the worst service, and staff I have ever encountered!  They were completely insulting to all of us that have worked in the service industry!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaraunt for an evening celebration since it's the only place open late for miles around.   I made a reservation for 10:00 p.m. but when we arrived they had us down for 10:00 a.m. the next day!   A seemingly honest mistake until you consider they aren't even open at 10:00 a.m.!  After sitting thre with menus for more than 20 minutes we had to seek out some one to take our order and that's when the waiting REALLY began!  The really bad and way too loud karoke made it seem longer...30 minutes....45 minutes... Finally 55 minutes later we got our food.   You'd think the waiting game would have been over at that point, but we ordered burgers and fries and apparently they don't come with condiments. We had to ask for mayo and ketchup- twice.  Our server sent somebody to the kitchen for it.   We never saw him again, despite a third request.   Finally, after waiting 15 minutes for condiments, my son in law went to the kitchen to get it himself.   Too bad the burgers were cold by then.   The food was decent overall... But service and speed were seriously lacking.  I gave it two stars because they accomodated our cake and gave us plates to serve it on."}
{"text":"We were so excited to take our family of four out to dinner at nny. We have wanted to go for awhile and although seated quickly, the staff appeared stressed and scattered. At first we thought they were short staffed. Our server would ask if we needed anything and then disappear for long periods of time. Our food came an hour after being seated and the server apologized but the wings were cold (both the meat and sauce) and my son's grilled cheese was hard as a rock. The fries were limp, brown, and cold and I could not believe the staffs poor meal prep and obvious lack in attention to detail. My son did not eat his dinner (we had to come home and make him something). Staff were friendly, but service was terrible. We paid (and tipped) although we should have been comped our meal or offered free chips and salsa app. No attempt was made to make it right. Poor, poor, poor and I am in customer service. I usually give the benefit of the doubt. Not tonight. Very disappointed. Booty's will remain our wing sports bar of choice. Reems and bell is a touch further but way better service and great food. Hope you all can work out the kinks because normally we love nny. I will say the staff was friendly though. Many seem new to serving."}
{"text":"WORST FRIDAY FISH FRY EVER....I have had many Fish Fry's in my Lifetime, and this was the worst I ever had.  They changed their fish from a good Haddock to a very cheap and low grade Pollock.  Never in my life have I had any restaurant serve Pollock as their fish....NEVER!   Cod in the norm for most restaurants that have a  Friday fish fry and it never seems to fail.  They do have Fish and Chips on their daily menu which is Cod, so we just assumed that it would be the same fish, only with it being on special, since it was Friday. This dinner was almost $12 a plate, which I thought was very high since most places are between 8 to 10 dollars for all you can eat, and this was not,  but I was willing to pay the price for a great Fish Dinner.  This was our fault for ASSUMING it was the same fish and not asking.  So with that said...This is to warn anybody who is thinking of going here to have their Friday Fish Fry...DON'T DON'T DON'T.   I am originally from Wisconsin and this fish was considered bottom, feeder CARP!"}
{"text":"i love buffalo wings from this place. i like it extra crispy and light on the sauce, which is perfect!!!  the service is great and quick with the check.  tuesdays are even better because it's wing day!! meaning it's 35cent a wing (i think)"}
{"text":"Native Grill & Wings is genuinely not the place of my style, and I don't usually go here often, but for multiple times, the location here has impressed me quite a bit. Unfortunately, not the point in which I was completely astonished. Without further ado, here are the simple reasons why I am only satisfactory with what I ate.  Pros: All of the food that each of us ate was delicious. I ordered the Friday Fish Fry, my sister ordered the Strawberry Walnut Salad, and my father ordered the California Burger. The Friday Fish Fry was decently large. It included a fried fish with tartar sauce, a mini salad with mayonnaise, lots of French fries with ketchup, and two pieces of flatbread. The fish was extraordinarily crunchy and fresh. When I look to the other dishes, I saw that they are enjoying them as well. The Strawberry Walnut Salad is full of fresh greens, but not many strawberries. The service was extraordinary. They always seem to check on you every five to ten minutes, and if you happen to dislike a specific channel on TV, you can tell them and they will immediately change the channel.  Cons: The location is tiny. During a football, basketball, soccer, etc. game, the place is CROWDED, and you may have to wait about 10-30 minutes until you get seated. (Wait until the Super Bowl XLIX starts. It will be absolutely miserable waiting for a SINGLE seat.) The food takes pretty long to prepare on these crowded days(then again, the forty-ninth Super Bowl) so you will have to be patient.  One thing is for sure, I'm coming back (early) for the Super Bowl. Definitely go to this location."}
{"text":"My father drags me everywhere--from Fry's Electronics to Popeye Chicken (UGH). Native Grill & Wings is actually one of the few places in which I do not dislike anything. I decided to write a simple easy review on this particular location, so why not? Let's cut to the chase.  Pros: I'm not exactly a sports fan, but this is DEFINITELY a place for one. There are TVs everywhere, throughout the patios, the indoor areas, and at the bar. They are all constantly switched on to ESPN, FOX Sports, and on rare occasions, ESPN2. From the looks of it, it seemed impossible to not have a clear view of the TV screen without having someone's head, arm, etc. block your way. We came on Sunday, and the wings are crazy cheap. The fish and chips had a pretty decent taste, as we split them all up between the three of us. The service was not particularly the nicest, nor the meanest, but was speedy when talking to us. They had great placing of all the heat lamps and chairs outside in the patio, so it is great to come during the winter. The location is fairly large, so you can almost always find a table to sit at.  Cons: The patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes. I am not a smoker, nor do I give any offense to smokers, but the patio REEKS of smoke. The service here is fast-speaking, but not exactly fast-moving. We waited for several minutes between when we asked for the check and the delivery of the check itself. The fish and chips had decent taste, but not decent size. They were tiny compared to the fish and chips in the OTHER location for the same price and meal. I was really disappointed when I saw this. We did not get enough wings. There were only 4 wings for the 3 of us for EACH dish.   Overall, this is simply not the greatest restaurant I've experienced. Its other competitors were able to show a performance at least twenty times better than this one. Thanks, but I'd rather visit the Ahwatukee location from this time on."}
{"text":"Cold food. Reheated. Still cold. Will go elsewhere for wings. Save yourself from  a bad experience. Management should fire the cooks."}
{"text":"Food is great and staff is always friendly. We eat here often. Love the buffalo chicken dip so good!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for so many years but have gone less since it was sold to chain. Went last night at 7:30 & prob won't eat here again. To begin, the booth we were seated in had a huge tear/hole in the fabric, dinner plate size. Ordered 2 beers, wings & wedge salad with blue cheese. Beer was fine. Wings were dry, minimal sauce, like they'd been sitting too long. Hubby & I didn't see our server for a few minutes after they were delivered, so decided to eat them. Salad was covered in Italian dressing. Finally found someone to bring us some blue cheese dressing but realized there was too much Italian on it to save it. Got the bill & we were over charged on wings (Tues supposed to be .69@ vs. 1.29@!). Finally got the bill adjusted. My hubby used the restroom & there was a guy in there vomiting, more than once. I thought, pls don't let me be sick tonight.  Used to love to come here to watch games & get quality wings, going to have to find another place to eat. So sad, it really was the only neighborhood bar w/used-to-be good bar food in the area, esp since Nello's left. Since it's a big chain I don't see this place getting any better."}
{"text":"This is definitely a new restaurant. The service was sub par both times. Food was good and prices reasonable. I will wait a few months before trying again."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times we live a block from this place. The first time we went in we were there for 2 hours wings were cold and I never got my 2nd beer but waitress wanted to charge me for it. The 2nd time was much better but still not great maybe if we have a third try I will update it but I am not impressed for the prices the food kinda sux"}
{"text":"Food and service deteriorating.  Fish Sliders buns were crusty and hard, fish patty was singed and the sauce was a small dollop haphazardly placed on the bun.  Becoming discouraged with this place."}
{"text":"The Lemon pepper chicken was fine, but the blended strawberry margaritas tasted like blended ice no strawberry and no alcohol. ..But the service was good."}
{"text":"Horrible! Waited 15 min  walked into dinning room and only 3 tables had people with 20 empty. Service was bad and super slow messed up order. Food was mediocre burger was good just needed some sort of condiment because dryness. Wings were rough on the pallet stick to original buffalo. After she took all the plates she came back  10 minutes later an asked if we were done. We had to ask for check because apparently it wasn't implied."}
{"text":"Soggy wings, flat coke and a frazzled bartender on a slow night made for a disappointing end to a Sunday evening... although close I will not recommend or be back.   Cheers -"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I would rather eat out of my dogs bowl than this dump. The manager is oblivious to tweakers walking outside with beer and has no control over the restaurant. Waited over an hour to get our cold food which we didn't eat we just paid for our drinks and left. The restrooms were filthy dirty just overall horrid thanks it's now 7:30 and I'm now in the drive thru."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVER. ..last week one evening i went with one of my friends and service was so poor. We were neglected from start. If i want to be specific -- I had to ask 3 times for a glass. No water was served until I asked twice with only one straw for 2 glasses of water. My bourbon was served with lots of ice filled till top with no small straw to drink, it was literally impossible to drink with so much ice with no straw. If possible I would like to give negative star for my visit this evening to Native Grill at Mesa Dr and Brown at Mesa, AZ. I don't even know if they care about customer review.....Girish"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times in the last 2 months and the food was terrible and not hot, wings where dry and service wasn't very good at the bar area. I told myself I wouldn't eat there again after the second time but a friend invited me so I tried again and 3rd strike for this particular Native and I'm out!!!! My friend agreed cause his food was cold when it came after waiting over 30 min to get our food..."}
{"text":"Definitely disrespectful service, being hung up on twice while placing an order over the phone."}
{"text":"I have been to this Native many times over the past year. Overall, I have been satisfied with the service and the food. There are times where I had to wait a little bit longer for food, but they were busy so it was understandable. I do recommend this place to people in the area."}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight (4/8) at this location. Not sure we will go back. My husband ordered the Fish and Chips. He liked that.  I ordered the Apple Walnut (?) Salad and added the chicken. When the salad was delivered to me I had to double check to make sure the chicken was not just strips of white bread. It was the most anemic grilled chicken I had ever seen. The headliner of the salad was 'apples' and nuts'. I could not have gotten more than a tablespoon of diced (small, at that) apples and maybe a little more on the nuts. I never got the garlic flatbread that was supposed to come with it. I really wanted to see if the waitress noticed. Ha! Service was not that great. As a diabetic I had to go home and eat more carbs.  I may think about trying again at a later date. Boy, could I make that a better salad!"}
{"text":"The bartender Ashley makes an amazing bloody mary! Food is awesome! And they have a lot of TV's... Alexis and the rest of the staff are on point as well!"}
{"text":"I have been to this NNYr three times and each time has been a pleasant experience. Their wing selection is good and their \"hot\" sauce is probably our favorite compared to the other wing giants. Beer selection could be better and they need to get it on the menu because I would rather peruse it than hear the server rattle off 20 choices.  We had the fried zucchini and spin dip for apps and both were excellent.  Since switching to a plant based diet(I'll still eat meat): They don't have many vegetarian options other than salads, fried veggies, and a veggie calzone. I opted for the buffalo fish sliders, which were a crispy, tasty treat. I did have a bite of my wife's hot strippers and it was really good. My daughter and I each tried one of their suicide wings, which were a little hotter than \"hot\", but not by much.   Service has been good to excellent each time I have gone - much better than BWW."}
{"text":"I was part of a group gathering.  We had great service and really enjoyed the food there.  The restaurant is located around other businesses in which gives you a chance to make a complete outing.   Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"My son and his football teammates asked me to take them out on Sunday nights for the first half of the late game. So we started this tradition in week one of the 2014 NFL season. The boys all had a budget. They all needed to order within their budget and have enough left over for a minimum 20% tip for the server. The kids were taught how to order for themselves, stay within budget, be polite and respectful and take care of the severs. They excelled!!  We went to Native for the next consecutive 21 NFL Sundays. Sometime we only had 4 people in attendance, sometimes we had 12 people. Overall we averaged 7 people per week. We were staples for Sunday afternoon and spent thousands of dollars collectively. The wait staff, managers and even bar staff all knew us. The servers always commented on how well behaved the kids were. They were polite and respectful and they were noticed.  This past Sunday, the hostess took exception to us seating ourselves at an empty table in the bar section. For the prior 21 weeks, we never encountered any issues. It's not like the bar section is crowded at 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon, it never is. We have always had an easy time of selecting the same table or tables.   Well, the hostess chased us down, scolding us reminding us there was not an open seating policy. She went back to her booth and I reminded her that we will not tolerate her attitude.   A manager later came over to me to inquire what happened and when I explained it to her, she started babbling about litigation between employees and employers. Huh?   Over the past 22 weeks we have never encountered anyone so rude and unprofessional. My kids have never been so disrespected. We have always had a great time at Native. We enjoy the food, the service and the atmosphere. The staff, with the exception of this one hostess, is terrific! The managers are great, especially Cheryl.   Due to this one bad experience, my boys have asked me to take them to Buffalo Wild Wings on Gilbert Rd instead. So, it's a sad day, but life goes on. Goodbye Native!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Native for years now. Since it was Native \"New Yorker\". I love Native and have given it so many chances. The last straw was with the drink menu changes. The food in my opinion has declined over the years, as has the management. The nachos used to be AMAZING, as were other things on the menu. Now I would say sub par at the most. The burgers are good though!The waiters and waitresses have mostly been great, especially Justin. The amount of changes recently have thrown me off and frankly have put me off from coming here. I understand things have to evolve but it feels two steps forward one step back. They used to have the BEST reverse happy hour but recently they have been changing it a lot and they just upped the prices again, second time in the past few months. While still decent, I can honestly now go to another reverse and get the same deal. There is no reason for me to pick Native now. This used to be me and my family/friends place and it was loved, now I don't think I will be coming here very often, if it all. I wish they hadn't changed so much."}
{"text":"Native Grill is our Tuesday night go to place for great wings. The food is good,but our server,Jeri Lynn is fantastic. She is friendly and has a great memory as to what drinks we usually order. She's truly an asset to this restaurant and a big reason why we return every week."}
{"text":"They changed the name but still the same bad service and food, its horrible!, went there tonight and ordered drinks, all watered down of course, differerent name, same bad service and watered down drinks!"}
{"text":"Worst service of all time. Literally just gave me a plate to eat off of that had not been cleaned. Waiting 35 minutes for some appetizers. About to walk over to McDonald's and come back & it might be ready. It's not even fight night? Oh and there's been a dirty towel on my table that had been there since we sat down...   This may be the first time I've never tipped"}
{"text":"So I am from out of town and this place was recommended by locals. Not really sure why it's recommended unless u enjoy waiting a long time for food and having to remind your server more than once to bring you a refill. Walked in the restaurant at 9:10 it's now 10 and still haven't received our food and only 1 refill. Disappointed. Now they have turned off all the televisions with customers still in the store. Really? How about a little common courtesy."}
{"text":"Well after the first five good trips to this place I must say the service has officially came to the status of shitty! The last two time we walk into the bar area and seat our selves as usual we wait two more party's come in and promptly are waited on fifteen minutes later waiter says I can help right now I'm busy! Someone come and acts mad and gets us drinks we order right when he gets back and says I don't know why the other guy didn't help you! The bill came with the food no refills no are you ok! We try and wave someone down to pay and no one responded. So I get up and chase down a passing bartender and ask if I can pay with a big sign and a few huffs and puffs she take it we pay and leave! Today we walk in sit and wait five minutes a couple walks in sits gets menus and there drinks! This time we leave and don't think we will be back anymore! There loss seeing as I am a good tipper and a nice person."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the Philly Cheesesteak with the broccoli and cheese soup. Everything was delicious! Our server Mathew was awesome! I would definately come here again."}
{"text":"We came here to get a drink and order some bar food at 11pm on a Saturday. We literally had to seat ourselves, grab our own menu's from the hostess stand, and the only way we even got waited on was because I probably looked like I was about to stab someone in the eyeball after waiting to be acknowledged for 15 minutes. Seriously the worst service I ever had. I used to wait tables at a sports bar, and when you have 12 seated tables, 3 waitresses, 2 bar tenders, and 2 bus boys, your patrons should not have to grab their own freaking menu's after waiting to be paid attention to for 15 minutes of sitting in a nearly empty restuarant. You seriously couldn't pay me to come back here."}
{"text":"Loving happy hour! Good service, great prices and tons of TV'S to watch all the sports you need to catch."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!!... If you havent ever been here you don't know what you're missing... There is no possible way to beat the happy hour )1.50 beer and 2.50 shots of patron... Plus Cat does a great job with karioke on Friday!!!"}
{"text":"After a Cardinals game took a few friends there for a bite. Possibly the worst hamburger I've ever had. Had the same flavor as the old soy mix cafeteria burgers we had in grade school. Dreadful. Waitress we had was awesome, food was horrible."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Nice daily and happy hour specials. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Sat down in a booth in the bar area. Looked clean, but was super sticky. Service was slow. It was a Sunday early afternoon and bar was full, but after an hour it cleared out. Service was still slow. I wasn't aware that places like this allowed ecigs. A woman at the bar was puffing away and blowing out big clouds of vapor and it made me sick. That alone convinced me never to come back. I thought there were ordinances in place for smoking in restaurants. If there are, then shame on the management and bartenders for allowing it."}
{"text":"I'm torn I really have liked this place since Native has opened. Over the last 4 months it has gone down hill. Dirty plates, crappy service. Having to check the bills for mystery items. Not even good enough to be called a good dive. Starting football season and now I'm searching for a new spot."}
{"text":"PROS:  A few lcd tvs with sports.  But put in excellent points of view, while not being overwhelming like at sports bars.  A great place to take friends who like sports, but also to talk at a normal speaking voice.  Food was delivered in 20 min.  Quality and presentation was adequate.  reasonably priced.    CONS:  A little too dimly lit for my taste."}
{"text":"I have never had Preston as a server but was glad that he saw me and recognize me. He knew what I drink.  Very nice and was on top of my order."}
{"text":"I only go here for lunch, not sports tv, but I've had an excellent meal and service each time.  I freaking love and crave their lettuce chicken wraps, I do switch out and get regular ranch, instead of the funky low-cal ranch vinagarette, but they are delish!  The service has been fast and efficient each time.  No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Love this place!! All the staff is real nice even though they are all busy (this place gets packed). They have great wing specials Mondays and Tuesdays. The wings are great!! The pizza is also great!"}
{"text":"Have been there 2x since it reopened. Both times they had to correct the bill because the drinks we ordered had extra charges attached even though they were on happy hour. (I'd recommend you double check the bill before you pay.) The second time service was mediocre at best and the wings were cold"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start. We walked in 2 hours ago. All we wanted was beer and wings. It took an hour to get 2 of the 3 wings we order. Then after sending back the 3rd wings because they were cooked beyond anything you could eat. They took another hour. Just unreal at how a wing place could not make wings. I am so disappointed and will never come back. Beer and wings should not be so difficult."}
{"text":"Good prices on wings, good flavors, and typically fast service. This place has yet to disappoint"}
{"text":"Love my Native!!! My favorite place to come for happy hour or to have a pint after a round of golf. The staff is super cool and so is the management. I've known some of the staff for years and some even longer than that from other Natives. They're the reason I frequent this place. Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey club sandwich to go. The presentation of the food was appropriate. However, little did I know the night I was about to endure. After finishing my meal at home, I immediately felt indigestion. A few short hours later, I experienced all symptoms of food poisoning from this meal for multiple hours throughout the night. My perspective on a meal so simple did not include the events that followed consumption. Although some might be upset, I've simply lost my trust eating here."}
{"text":"Kitchen supervisor Ricardo at Native on Ray and the 10 has made it clear that he will not be allowing any special orders in his restaurant and that one shouldn't even bother coming to his establishment with special orders.   If you like all flat wings like I do, don't eat at this place.   If you like extra sauce or light sauce dont go here.  According to Ricardo it is too much work for the kitchen staff to have to do anything special like add extra sauce when they are so busy.  It's your money people, it's your choice.   I say stay away."}
{"text":"I don't go here for amazing food, I go here because it is family friendly and the servers are always so friendly. We love the wings and how accommodating the kitchen is for requests and mixing flavors. My kids have grown up eating at Native!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Pizza, No Joke 5 Star. Locally Owned and Operated and it Shows!  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"We are here for the USSSA Spring Training tournament. After a long day at the baseball fields we were looking for a place to relax with the kids and enjoy some dinner.  We walked into Native with no prior notice. They were able accommodate our entire team including players and families (40+ people). The manager and staff got us in quickly and were very friendly. Jordan was our server and he was awesome.  Busted his butt bringing food and drinks and was 100% engaged with our team.  Great food and great service !!!!!!! N"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Monday night. Wasn't busy but our waitress seemed like she didn't want to help us and the tables in her section. Didn't refill our drinks.. when we asked for napkins she threw them on the table. Took forever to take our order. The service was bad. The food was okay. I for sure will not be dining here again. I'll stick to my side of the valley."}
{"text":"Wow unbelievable !! Went with my mom & my brother & ordered a salad ,a plain burger & a club sandwich . It was a Thursday at 2:50 was not busy at all only 3 tables were full . & still waited 45minutes for our order . We had to leave because I was so hungry (35weeks pregnant ) & told them we can't wait any longer & still made us pay 8 bucks for 3 drinks .. They were rude about the whole situation ..."}
{"text":"Just had lunch, server was great and food fantastic. Best wings in town!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant but we wish they would get sweet potato fries! We have asked for years and don't understand why they don't get them. Best wings and strippers around!!!"}
{"text":"Was not pleased. I use to love their food but the quality has gone down hill and on top of that the last time mt family and I sat down to eat three associates got together at a table straight across from us and did a drug deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Drink specials after 9:30 are so nice! Bartenders are always friendly and ready to help you out! Thanks for being awesome native staff!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I was so excited that they reopened this location. I normally like this place,however this time around they just opened this location up again.. this was my first time coming in the hostess sat us down and said that our waiter would be with us. We waited 20 mins.. during this time other customers where being served. We didn't even get approached and we didn't have a glass of water! As we picked up our things and walking out the guy who I think was the manager since he was the only one in a red shirt. He saw us walking out and didn't even try to ask us what was wrong. Ended up going to chipotle across the street and it was very satisfying.."}
{"text":"The service was good but that is far as I can go. When wings are one of your signature dishes one would think they would be hot cooked to order. Not the case here the \"hot wings\" were cold to the touch had to send them back. We pay good money and the food is sub par at best."}
{"text":"So I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt based on all the other bad reviews, but they are right. This place is horrible. I haven't gotten served my food yet after a half hour+. Bathrooms are dirty. I pray to God the food doesn't suck as bad as the service!!  Upgrading my 1 star to 2 star cause the in bone wings were awesome! But a restaurant is only as good as its service! The GM should be fired and bring in someone who knows the service industry."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, went in on Tuesday to buy a dozen wings but wanted them fried then grilled, the server told me that they won't grill them on Tuesdays, I offered to pay to have them grilled. He brought out manager and was told same thing. I left and went to location on Gilbert who are 3 times busier than alma school location and guess what, no problem getting my wings grilled. Now I will never enter the alma school location again, brilliant management decisions"}
{"text":"this place is awesome for guys that like to watch football, eat burgers and scream when happens something with their team ...I m  not really a fan of a sport bars but....it's the only one around here!!!"}
{"text":"First-timer here, with a co- worker. They have a good selection of salads, burgers, pizza, calzones, and a terrific selection of wings. We had attentive host and wait staff, but waited nearly an hour for a burger, salad and wings on a slow week night.   I certainly don't mind waiting for good food, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Wow, I've never met a more friendly hostess. I wonder if she was the owner. I needed a relatively quick lunch and had the a club sandwich. My partner and I were amazed at the attentiveness of the staff. I'll be back next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat I was scared for my life in this native, servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and the manager didn't seem to be helping at all. It took 45 minutes from when we ordered to receive our food and when we did both of our pizzas were soggy. The manager who delivered them looked and sounded like a grumpy Santa Claus with no regard for us customers. I am in disbelief of how bad the service was, compared to the native on Estrella."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have some wings and watch the World Series game. When I walk in I order a beer and wings and request that one if the 5 TV's be changed to the game( yes a \"sports bar\" was not showing the World Series...sad). After  4 requests and being ignored by the bartender I paid for my beer and went somewhere else. I was the only customer sitting at the bar so I don't think I made an unreasonable request. I can now see why this establishment only has a 2 star rating.  Just sad service.  Should not have had to make that request in the first place.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Slow slow slow service and ordinary food.  The bone in wings have little meat... The boneless ones are the better route here.  My wife described her hamburger as \"lacking taste\" and my mother in law scraped the filling off her lettuce wraps and threw out the lettuce.  We allowed the kids to order desserts but it took 22 minutes to arrive.  Ridiculous.  Waiter kept saying that they were on the way.  Not sure why we keep coming back every year.... Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"God where to start. We went on a Sunday night football wasn't busy at all! but the server was rude and short and looked like she hated her job. The food is just awful. They over charge you for absolutely nothing. Drinks were never refilled and the server was no where to be found. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I was so hungry! And extremely disappointed with the service, food and entire experience. The table they sat us at was sticky. I asked the waitress twice to please clean it. We ordered our food and it took almost 45 min to be severed then we didn't have any silverware once we were served. I had to ask the waitress for some and instead of getting it right way she goes and takes someone's order which was a very large group so in the mean time I asked another waiter to bring us silverware he did. As we began to eat the food the chicken was burnt the wings I asked for crispy but got soggy ones instead the noodles were so soft it was just disgusting. Btw the name is no loner Native it's Native the grill and I will never return again."}
{"text":"Wings are not from a chicken, way too small. Not my favorite."}
{"text":"The service was good but...That was the worst burger I've had in a long time. My husband said he's had a better burger that came from a vending machine. We had wings and burgers. The wings came out in like two minutes which leads me to believe that they are not made to order. They were probably sitting around and they just added the sauce. Then we ordered the burgers and they came out just as quick, also not made to order. The meat had no flavor. I'm not sure if they even put them on the grill at all. We barely ate them at all. They did not charge us for the burgers which I really appreciate and is why they get two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Lindsey is the beeez neeez. She is absolutely the best server I've ever had. If you go to native, ask for lindsey!!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay food, horrible service. Our waitress couldn't even be bothered to take our drink order, the hostess came and took our drink order after about 10 minutes. Once the waitress delivered our food, she apparently only had time for the other tables around us. Even when we asked for additional condiments, which she assured she'd bring out right away. We had to ask the hostess for to-go containers and after waiting another 15 minutes hoping for our check, we finally gave up and went to the hostess station to pay. Then our waitress had the nerve to say she wasn't ignoring us. Too bad they don't have better servers."}
{"text":"We went to have wings, a couple of beers and watch the Raiders.  The hostess promptly sat us and was very sweet.  It took a while before the server finally arrived.  It took awhile before we got our drinks.  Then much much longer for our appetizer.  Throughout the evening they had people walking around checking on the same few tables.  Our table wasn't so lucky.  After waiting which seemed like forever, our server would show up.  We decided to order desert and skip the main course.  Our server finally brought out 2 burnt cookies with ice cream blopped on top.  She sat it on the table smiled then walked away.  Wow.  The service was horrible with so-so food to follow the bad service.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you enjoy lousy food, and snail slow service."}
{"text":"Me and my family of 12 went and all of our wings tasted like they've been sitting up in the window for hours we didn't get our pizzas until 30 minutes after we got our wings and the pizzas had really light sauce on it that we didn't ask for our server was good but management should've had someone help him with the big table the food was not good but you guys need more silverware and plates seems like no one wants to work as a team there"}
{"text":"Food and service was nothing far of average. Not having been to Native in many moons, we arrived at this destination as the chosen venue after a graduation. Understanding that this was a busy evening, the restaurant shouldve been well prepared for what was in store (my review is not based on their lack of preparation, rather what I experienced during my visit).  Service 3: Our server could not provide any good recommendations on any of the food. And the one thing she did suggest was mediocre (pizza). All servers should be required to try each item on the menu. That way when a customer asks, \"how's the ... ?\", they can answer honestly vs. no answer at. As a customer, I want to hear how great things taste, not \"I don't know\". KNOW YOUR MENU!   My real issue was with the children's food. We ordered 2 mac n cheese dinners, but only one showed up. We inquired with other food runners who claimed to be checking into the matter, still nothing. Finally, after asking a third runner, someone stepped up and personally owned the issue. After waiting 20 mins from the time we asked how much longer would it be for the second meal, it finally arrived. You would've thought this was gourmet mac n cheese. Nope! Straight up Kraft (but the fruit cup was pleasing).  Our waitress NEVER came to confirm if everything was ok or if we needed anything else. Had she done that she would've known that we had a 4 year old who was extremely unhappy that all the other children had eaten and she hadn't.   Servers: CHECK ON YOUR PEOPLE! Your tip depends on it.   Food 3: as mentioned earlier, the food was mediocre at best. My pizza was nothing fancy. The children's mac n cheese was a knock-off version of Kraft (blue box version folks).   I personally have no reason to return as I found nothing appealing on the menu that would satisfy my tastebuds. There was quite the selection of food on the menu but, I couldn't find anything that would be worth a second go round."}
{"text":"We live in Surprise and we were very apprehensive in trying out this new restaurant based on all the bad reviews. We finally tried it out today and we are glad to report that we had a great experience! The wings were excellent, the service fast and courteous. Give it a try, don't let the bad reviews scare you away."}
{"text":"Another less than average experience. Wings were cold.  The waitress failed to tell us about the Sunday special and wanted to get our order BEFORE we had menus. Oh well - luckily we have CK's, Loco Patron and Uncle Bears to go to. Can say we won't be back - we tried."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a 2nd chance after a terrible grand opening with long wait times for food and then not getting some of the food we ordered.  Well, 2nd time is even worse than the first!  Over an hour to get food after ordering and when the food came the wings were less then Native quality.  Beyond small, barely warm, and rubbery like they had been sitting.  Never saw a manager once or I would have let him/her know without sugar coating it this time how I just wasted $50.xx and listened to my kids gripe about being hungry for over an hour until the food came out.  There are much better options for wings where the service and food quality is not this poor.  - 1 Star just because at least my iced tea was decent!"}
{"text":"I came here with a buddy of mine around 6:00 in the evening on a Wednesday. Against my wishes, we sat in the dining area instead of the bar.   The booth - WAY TO SMALL. I'm a skinny guy - 6' tall 165ish. I had to sit \"side saddle\" to feel somewhat comfortable. For those who don't know what that means, I had to sit SIDEWAYS with my legs on the seat, and my feet hanging off the end.   The atmosphere was devoid of life, and completely drained of energy. There were two other tables seated in the section.   The waitress had no idea what beers they offered, and had to read off a list. She also had no clue if they offered any season selections that might of had fruit flavoring of any kind.  When she came back from \"investigating\", she said they offered a hard apple cider. I ordered one along with an Italian beef. I've worked for a NNY in the past, and thought it to be a safe bet - bread, meat, cheese, au jus, fries. The sandwich could of been taken out of the salamander sooner, as the top had some burning to it.  My friend had boneless wings - I'm not even going to waste time talking about deep fried, frozen commercial \"meat chunks\".   I don't go out to eat very often, but I do work as a chef. In aware of the difference between a horrible-great place is; I've worked for all in-between.  I knew I was in for low quality food, but for as DEAD as it was, I'd expected to see them at the top of their game.  This was mediocre at best.  At least the hard apple cider was good."}
{"text":"Why is everyone bashing this place??!! We got seated right away in the lounge (self seating sports bar area) no age limit. The service was great. The waiter was prompt fast and polite. We got our food quick. The wings here were fall off the bone amazing. I got mild and honey barbecue. And my girlfriend got fish and chips. Give this place a try. You won't regret it! Great food great atmosphere. Don't listen to 3 month old picky eater reviews. Bunch of damn whiners."}
{"text":"Visited for a quick bite to eat, and got the friendliest server.... Tiffany was very quick at taking my order and never let my beer get empty before offering me another. I will definitely return. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome place just to chill, good food, good times! Went for dinner one night had such a helpful server( Dominique), then stayed after to karaoke!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location was upset over the wrong wings and the salad had no dressing. Come on no dressing it how they serve it. YUCK! The waitress was very nice they tried to accomendate us but it was still a bad experiance."}
{"text":"Tons of TV's! Great for watching the game. Good food, good beer selection. Happy hour is 3-7pm. Pretty cool place. I had the chicken tenders and they were great. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We were there on a Tuesday for wings, the wings were really good no complaint on the food. It took a bit for the food to get to our table but it was ok.   What we did not liked, server was in a bad mood, not friendly just to do his job. At the end we has some left over wings and he said we could not take the wings to go because those were in special??   Never had that happened anywhere else, I paid for my food and I can take it with me right!!  Well I kind ask him again for a box to go and he give me one with a bit of attitude.  Food was good but horrible service, will not go back there again."}
{"text":"There has always been slow service here, and the only reason we come is because it's the closest one to our house and we like the wings. This time did it for me  because we were seated and we could not get the attention of a waiter/waitress. We waited 10 minutes and we HADN'T EVEN BEEN OFFERED DRINKS YET. We told the front person and he was going to take our order but it wasn't worth it at that point. We went somewhere they actually want our business. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my meal and drinks at Native. But, what made my night was the fast and quality service from our server, Dillan. She was very kind, fast with the drinks, and even brought me Tabasco sauce when I asked. I'm very glad to see excellent customer service still be held so valuable by the management team. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I don't ever really come here to eat I usually come just to have a few beers , I've had the wings from other locations and I've had the wings from this location... They're not mind blowing or anything...just reg ol'wings...Tonight I asked for recommendations from my server who was I believe the manager, I believe I chose his third or fourth recommendation which was a chicken Philly. the Philly was very dry, didn't have enough peppers and onions, and was very small in portion size for the price. It's sad to say but I actually enjoyed the French fries that came with the meal better than the actual meal . Also ordered some mozzarella sticks nothing special there just regular ol' mozzarella sticks. I'm just going to go back to attending this chain of restaurants for their happy hour drinks. Jason and DJ are definitely two of the best employees I've had the pleasure of being attended to by them."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome!!  I understand the wait at this place on Tuesday nights...especially since this is the only Native New Yorker around for miles.  Going back soon I hope!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here on a fairly regular basis and the staff provide great friendly service - thanks Sarah! It's a little slow during the week but there's Karaoke on Friday nights and plenty of TV screens. This has to be the best place in Gilbert to have some drinks and some eats and not break the bank. Whenever I have to decide between places to go in Gilbert and my wallet isn't exploding with cash this is the place to go - which doesn't mean a sacrifice on the beer Corona's $2.50 and food. Happy Hour is at 9:30 which keeps me from giving them five stars - used to be 8:30 - perfect! Also, ask for the Flatbread special. You can put together the ingredients you want (sauce, cheese & toppings) and it will melt in your mouth. There's an outside firepit for the cooler nights with plenty of table seating. High top tables and booths inside make for comfortable seating. If you haven't been in a while I recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone in here twice now and will never return... The first time we came in the wings were  cold the manager came and said he tempt them they came out at a temperature of 145 if you know food chicken needs to be cooked to 165. We left unhappy and hungry ... Went back a few months later walked in at 945 and said the kitchen was closed and they couldn't serve us.. Weird since the door and online say you close at 11 . If you changed your hours change your website... Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Okay so I gave this place a second chance. How could I be so forgiving from my last experience? Once again, the food here is horrible. You're better off buying Tyson frozen wings and heating them up yourselves. Don't go here...ever."}
{"text":"The ratio of food quality to price was unsatisfactory. I did NOT try their wings (which they seem to be known for). Service did seem to be a redeeming quality.  Vegetarians Beware: Be prepared for another meat heavy Americana restaurant with few and unimaginative meatfree options (circa T.G.I. Fridays, Chile's, etc.)"}
{"text":"Good Food! & Good Service! Good Beer Ice Cold! The Only Downside us when you first initially walk into the bar area theres a bad scent then you get used to it. The restaurant portion is great all around."}
{"text":"Have been there several times to watch football on Sunday afternoon. Want to finally give them a review. The food is very tasty, they have many different types of wing sauces and I have never been disappointed.  The pizza is good and the beer is always cold. The servers there are very good, excellent personalities and very attentive.  I would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service! We usually have a good size group and nothing is ever overlooked or forgotten!"}
{"text":"Had some issues today. Have been here many times. Know it was \"one of those days\" let them know, they made it right. If you have a problem, give them the opportunity to make it right - I believe they will."}
{"text":"First visit last night. Food was good but seemed a bit pricey for what you get. I had the fish taco and thought it was really good.  May have been because it was Saturday night and there was also a MMA event on TV...but it was loud and we could barely talk at the table.  I left feeling the food was ok but I certainly would go back when it's not as rowdy in the bar area."}
{"text":"Last night we went to this location.  It was relatively slow. We were seated a couple of minutes after getting there. Our waiter came over to get our drinks. We all ordered water with the intent to eat some hit wings. I ordered 12 wings and a side of fries. Took about 30 minutes or so when our food came out. My wings and fries were so disappointing.  They were luke warm and became cold pretty fast. Everyone else at the table said their food was cold as well. While I probably could have ate my wings before they got completely cold, I was too busy trying to wave down the waiter to refill all of our waters. I would understand if it was busy or we were a big party but that was not the case. The management needs to take some tips from the Dobson Location because that's how your establishment should run. I live near this location but if I ever want Natives wings, I'll be sure to drive a few miles to the Dobson location."}
{"text":"We are here usually once every few week! We frequent this Native even though another one is much closer.  We have always been warmly welcomed by Cari the manager and today we once again had excellent service from Ashley.  Oh and the blackberry margarita was AMAZING!!! Will order again!"}
{"text":"So. I just called to see if Native was open.  The dumb girl who answered the phone says \"No. We are closing right now\".  & then hung up on me.  .  Why the hell did you answer the phone you idiot?  I love the honey hot wings. It's the only reason I go back. It's certainly not because of the staff. Rude."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE...COLD/ HARD FOOD Our server (Justin or Travis I cant remember) was so forgetful. We asked for certain things and he brought something different. He didn't pre-bus the table so there were a bunch of dishes crowding our tiny table. He dropped stuff on the floor and didn't pick it up. Our food was cold and stale when it finally came out too, we mentioned it to him and he didn't seem to care that it was subpar. When we finished out meal the wings that we ordered as an appetizer finally came out."}
{"text":"I love going on cheap wing night! Love the strawberry hot wings. Service could have been a little better but it was busy, so it was expected to not have GREAT service. Great value and great taste. Watch the game with family and friends Good for kid too Don't Drink and Drive!"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience here at Native. As always great service and great food from great people. Thank you Mindy!!!"}
{"text":"Going to Native for a second time reminded me why i dont like it..I will never go back to this place! Service and food were horrible.  First off, it took about 10-15 minutes to even get our drinks.. (it was a Monday night,  not busy at all). The food was the worst..all 4 of us ordered something different and we were all not impressed. It just wasnt that great..it was like everything was just warmed up in either a pot or microwave.  McDonalds has more flavor in their food..and thats saying a lot."}
{"text":"Came in here before and wasn't greeted by anyone. Felt like a morgue. I've been to the native in Tempe and enjoyed it, this one not so much. After no hostess or server came around for a few minutes we ended up walking out the door. Oh well guess I'll stick to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"We were up in Phoenix earlier this week for a few baseball games and stayed on the PHX/Chandler side of town.  This particular Native New Yorker was just a few minutes from our hotel, so we thought we'd give it a try since they have trivia (Buzztime...formerly NTN) and acccording to their website, several beers on tap!  Beer selection was good, LIITs were excellent - and even better, we were pleasantly surprised by the food...better than your basic sports bar fare...it was good!  The first night we tried the chicken strips with asian garlic dipping sauce on the side (slightly salty, but very good).  Later we ordered a pepperoni pizza and thought it was just as good as Hazelwoods (with the exception of the crust, which I prefer to be as thin as possible).    The next night we checked out their sandwiches; John had the turkey wrap (loved it; suggests getting a little thousand island dressing on the side) and I had the reuben which was equally good.  It was a good crowd...we had some good trivia competition and no idiots anywhere in sight.  They have a patio with misters as well as plenty of space inside.   Loved our bartender Victoria, who is also one mean trivia player!  If you're looking for a good sports bar, we can recommend this one!  We won't hesitate to stop in again when we're in that part of town."}
{"text":"Food was cold or overcooked, service was slow at the bar with only 2 other patrons. Sad that it wasent better, probably wont go back"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food, a real disappointment in a restaurant.  I have tried coming to this restaurant a few times to give them another opportunity but every time I go in there I remember why I swore I'd never be back. Oh and not to mention they had woman's basketball on the TV. A sports bar and they didn't even have sports on. What the hell!"}
{"text":"Upon first entering I was a little leery.  The Native in Goodyear and Buckeye is a bit newer.  I usually sit in the bar but decided to have a meal out on the patio as the day was pleasant.  The food was decent no complaints nothing super special but nothing negative to say.  The beer was cold which is always good! What made the visit pleasant was our server Breanna.  She was always quick with a refill I do not think we had to ask once and never left us wanting for any thing more.  She was quite a joy to talk to and was telling us how she was from Michigan.  Too cold if you ask me just like our beer!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Laveen since 2007 and have always tried to do our part to support the few businesses we have in our small corner of the Valley. We were regulars to Native for many years...then baby came along. We stopped coming as frequently, and each time we came the service and quality was worse each time. I absolutely adore Native...just not this location. The last straw for us was when we had a 2hr lunch about 3 weeks ago...when we intended to be in and out in about 45min. It took 30 min for the server to take our drink order. Another 10 before he took our food order. Food arrived 40 min later ice cold. When the server asked how the food was, I told him it was ice cold but we were far too hungry to wait another 30min for our order to be remade. That is the last time we will go back."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I lounge spot. We like to drink here every now and then. So on Tuesday the 23rd, one out of every night our service was really bad. She gave us our drinks and my dessert when we first ordered. So a few minutes, my in laws came to join us. she swinged by and took their order. Gave them their drinks and took our food orders. Therefore, she never came back, we waited over 40 mins for our food. Our waitress came back (40min later) and ask 'if we need refills'. Outgrew our patients and mad. We asked how long is our food going to arrive. She gave us a look like 'could you be a little more patients' and said \"its my fault but your food should be done in a few minutes\" and suddenly my mother in law said \"no, we don't want to eat hear, how much is for the drinks and the dessert? We don't wanna dine here\". The waitress continually apologised and said \"you guys can go, its on me\". So we left with upset stomachs and we dine somewhere else. We should of sat in our regular waistress section.."}
{"text":"Had great wings but took forever one hour for wings and a salad. Greek salad worst ever. Stale cold flat bread like out of the fridge,  microwaved chicken, and very little weird dressing. Not a good one. Maybe if wr had more it would have been ok but ."}
{"text":"The fish sliders and the wings are excellent but the service is very slow.  If you're on a business lunch,  you'll have trouble eating in an hour."}
{"text":"I have been going here for Tues. 1/2  price wings for a long time. Now my Tues. plans have changed about two weeks ago, as the bill came the server informed us that the price of wings went up .10 each. That was just rude- I mean tell me before I order.  They said the wings are bigger now.  Not by much-there are many other places that have good deal on wings. See ya - gotta go for the better deals"}
{"text":"Ordeded a 2 carryout wing platters with extra blue cheese dipping sauce,  they said it would be ready in 15 minutes, i arrived 25 minutes after i ordered and it wasn't ready, waited a additional 15 minutes then got my order, rushed back to work to find they didn't give me fries and gave me only one container of blue cheese.  Called them back, they said i only order wings and not a platter.  I got no fries, no extra blue cheese dipping sauce, no utensil packets and no celery. Horrible service..."}
{"text":"Love love love the food and atmosphere! We always come in for the $0.59 wings on Tuesday and throughout the week. Last time we had Josh as our server and he was excellent, always anticipating what we needed."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. Our waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Has not been open long.  We have been there a couple times.  We had an issue with one of our drinks  the first time and the assistant manager took care of it right away.  We went last night and he remembered us and was super nice.  Our waitress Stephanie was awesome.  Wonderful customer service from everyone.  Atmosphere is really nice.  We will be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"Specifically asked if their fries are natural potatoes and was told yes.  The truth is that they; have incompetent help that has never seen a natural potato, that native serves that same crappie batter coated fries that only restaurants serve that don't care about the quality of the food, and then they outrageously lie about it and charge 5 dollars."}
{"text":"Well to start off with my entire family has been coming here for years, anytime for wings and almost every tuesday. It wasn't until recently we weren't able to go as often. Oh my gosh going back seemed like the worst experience we have ever had. First off we have always sat in the bar because the dining room is a bit slow in service on tuesdays. We were denied seating by a waiter even though I was purchasing a beer. We decided to never come to this native new yorker ever again. Well just head south to the chandler one. Oh and this was about a month ago, so we've been to the chandler one about 8 times and have NEVER been denied any sort of service. Plus the food and service is way better at the chandler location. Looking at these reviews I can already see others having the same problem."}
{"text":"This place is the dirties restaurant/bar I've ever been in.  We were there for 30 minutes and couldn't get waited on. Tables sat fill of old food the whole time and looked like they have been there for hours.  We got up and left."}
{"text":"Place is empty on a Saturday night - not a good sign. Waiter says our food is coming only to tell us  10 minutes later that he forgot to put our order in! Offered to give us soup or salad - soup was not edible. Wings finally came out and didn't look like honey bbq. Ordered honey hot and honey BBQ. They looked the same and the waiter couldn't tell us the difference only that the hot looked glazed! Wings were not meaty at all. Pizza out of a box tasted better. All around bad experience. Don't waste your money. Even the waiter said the wings weren't his favorite and that's what they used to be known for."}
{"text":"The Native on Power Rd has a atmosphere and Dave is a great bartender.  But the best part of the bar is the clientele,  I was entertained all night by the patrons at the end of the bar. What a fun night!"}
{"text":"Wings are the only good thing about this place.  Wife and son both hate the food and they don't like wings."}
{"text":"We used to frequrent the Native off Guadalupe and Dobson before we moved to this side of town, we loved the food there and the servers. However we have gone to this location a half dozen times and the last 3 times we were very unsatisfied with the service and the warmth (lack of) of the wings. The last time we went we had brought our 3 month old (first wing and beer outing in how long??) After we were completely done and the server received her tip she told us that we could not have our baby in the bar. Really if that was your policy it would have been better to know at the onset."}
{"text":"I was starving and pulled in for lunch. Was hesitant because last visits weren't fun but things have changed.  I gotta give them credit, service was incredibly prompt, smiling faces, food was brought to table quickly and warm.  Was a pleasant experience.  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love their honey hot chicken wings BUT everytime we come here the service is always bad. You have people working at the front with no personality or whatsoever.  Then the girl that takes you to your seat on her butt can hear.  She need to speak up and they need someone at the front who is cheerful and happy to work there.  Then the waitresses are so slow you have to keep looking for them. Ughh so frustrating and it really ruins your night.  I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"This has got to be by far the best bar and grill in this area. The atmosphere is wonderful and the customer service was excellent. My family and I have only been here a few times but the waitress knew what our drinks would be. The food is always delicious with an reasonable wait time. Definitely has my vote for best restaurant of the year and its only February. Good job Native Team and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Horrible place. The service sucks!! The wings are not even that good. We tried all the sauces and they sucked! They tasted like they came out of a jar. I do not recommend for foodies. Just like a chain. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Had some great service with a top notch, friendly, highly responsible, positive crew serving in the bar this evening.  Tanner was managing with Felicia, Michelle and Levi serving and Whitney behind the bar.  A great team!"}
{"text":"Good food all around.  Had a bunch of different things there but you can't beat the wings!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this Native New Yorker. The food is always well prepared and the staff is friendly. I normally only eat the wings or strippers but my family eats other items on the menu and I've never seen anything over or under cooked. Maybe the other reviews were poor because this restaurant opened recently and were just getting into the swing of things. Well, they're fully operational now and got all the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok.... Dinner salad was still defrosting and came after our pizza & deep fried mushrooms... They seemed to be overstaffed with romper room rejects! The mgr should cut staff & maybe pay a dollar or two more an hour to hire people who have reached puberty."}
{"text":"This location is their worst. The manager , Henry I'm told his name is, yells at the staff and the tension is thick.  I have seen regulars at the bar just roll their eyes at this. Wings Friday night tasted like vinegar.  Poor choice to spend your $$."}
{"text":"I came back after first time being there after getting take out after my birthday. It was in Friday night, I came to eat in and get a pizza, in the bar area. Also attending Karaoke. Met Chelsi, very nice woman. I also had a man named Riley take care of me, did a great job. Another manager I met at Native named Brian on duty there. Asking me if everything was alright. Told him everything was fine. The first time in a while found a place appreciates my business. Also customer service above and beyond. Great vibe there, everyone was nice. Will be back again.  Great job Native Grill and Wings Dobson and Guadalupe in Mesa."}
{"text":"Native used to be my favourite wing spot, but I've switched over to B-Dubs because the service has been horrible lately and they messed up my meal TWICE now in the last month and I'm just too nice to say anything. They have my favourite wing (the garlic Parmesan dry rub wings) but I'm afraid to go back.  But these wings are a must try! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Nick was amazing....he was fun and always had a smile on his face.....nice to see someone who loves their job. Natasha"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times (choices are slim in Buckeye) but whenever my husband suggests it now...it's a no!  The food is just ok.  I see more workers at a booth eating, hanging out and checking their cells than I do serving customers.  When you wait 20 minutes for food and watch kids walk out with plates full and sit down to eat...well not happy!  And if you want to find the manager - he's there too!  The waitresses have been pretty good but the food they bring is just ok.  So not worth the $50 or $60 tab.  I can't say one thing we like about the place and will drive into Avondale before we go to this place again."}
{"text":"I so, so....SO wanted to like this place. I literally live 4 miles down the road and it's pretty much the only place in the area with a decent bar. I also love supporting local businesses and want to see them thrive.  But alas, that hasn't been the case. Now, I can't blame the entire chain because I've been to other locations albeit going back a few years and I have friends that rave about their local store, so I can only guess it's the roll of the dice when you franchise, even at a local level.  To be fair, we've eaten at this location probably 5-6 times since it's been open, and while not every experience has been notably bad, none has stood out as a reason to return. That decision has been solely based on the fact that it's five minutes from my door. The biggest issue has definitely been the food. Several instances of receiving dishes hot on the outside and not-completely-thawed on the inside indicate that much of the menu is frozen and microwaved.....a common practice of casual dining I'm aware, but jeez, if you're gonna go that route, at least ensure that the food is heated properly. The wings, as has been mentioned is previous reviews are terrible. Flavorless, greasy, and fatty. BWW (the giant chain that it is) absolutely owns them on wings. Having hailed from a close proximity of NYC, I can attest that the pizza is not native of anywhere near there. :(  Service, at least after the typical awkward period when a new place opens in this bar/restaurant-starved area, has been admittedly pretty good, especially from the bartenders.  But that leads us to my final gripe, and what I feel would've been an easy way to redeem the shortcomings of the dining, the bar. The bar itself is simply too small and it's difficult to get a seat there, much less for two or more people. The surrounding bar area would typically handle this overflow, but they tend to just use it as regular seating when busy. I'm sorry, but when it's after 9 on a weekend night I don't expect to encounter screaming children in the bar area. If I wanted that I'd go to McDonald's. I've actually seen children AT the bar a few times when there was empty tables on the restaurant side......seriously?? In addition, the entire bar area is way too bright and could definitely benefit from a dimmer. I don't want to feel like I'm in a jewelry store when I go to a pub. Lastly, in this age of craft beer   renaissance, their tap selection is pretty pathetic, featuring (iirc) only one decent selection among a bunch of redundant mediocrity.   I do still have hope that perhaps it will improve, but sadly, it will likely take competition to make it happen since an ongoing history of negative reviews hasn't seemed to help....and in this area, it could take another five years till something else opens. For now, two stars for closeness and decent service."}
{"text":"Our server Lauren was quick to take our drink orders, dinner etc. Happy and helpful and paid attention to when we needed refills. Food was good. Fish n Chips. Usually go for burgers here but glad to try something different. Will go back and love happy hour all day Saturday!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.  Ambience is kind of different.  I was expecting dark, with lots of TVs.  Instead it's quite light, with a fair amount of TVs.  More like a breakfast vibe.  Not that there's anything wrong with the ambience, just........different.   Ordered their roast beef sandwich with au jus.  Wife had burger.  Food was really boring.  Sandwich was roast beef, a top bun and a bottom bun.  And fries.  No garnish, no lettuce, not even the traditional parsley sprig.  Bare bones presentation.  Same with the burger.  Pattie, buns, and fries.    Server was quite attentive, no problem there.    This place is just........boring.   Not worth the money."}
{"text":"My favorite Thursday and Friday night karaoke hangout. Great karaoke host. Good food, friendly staff. Good drink specials too. This is the only place I routinely go for karaoke. Good peeps."}
{"text":"I grew up eating native new yorker wings, but this location is simply not living up to the native new yorker tradition. The food and the service are not good, in fact they are poor. It is clear nobody including, but not limited to management cares or have the proper training to execute what should be simple bar food or common knowledge customer service skills. After over an hour I left hungry . Do not eat here unless you like tasteless food, soggy wings and poor service. I was still hungry so I went to IN AND OUT."}
{"text":"Went in with my family today to get something quick before our movie. Sat in the bar area with Alexia as our server. We ordered our pizza and wings (that we like a very specific way) and everything came out perfectly. Poor girl was dealing with a very difficult table next to us but handled it well, still being able to handle the other tables. The food here never disappoints and today, either did the service. Manager came to talk to another table and was also very friendly. Awesome food and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Didn't even make it past the hostess who felt it more appropriate to continue her obvious personal phone call. Rather than place her call on hold or heck even a quick \"I'll be with you in one second\" while she told her caller she had to get back to her JOB, she turned her face away from us and continued to chit chat. If that first impression is any indication of the type of service we would have received, then I am glad we walked out. No acknowledgment of any kind other than to purposely look the other direction. Terrible first impression."}
{"text":"I love the spicy wings aka \" suicide wings\" oh boy!! :3 But sometimes they don't do good job..meaning that sometimes wings are to dry, just with a little of the salsa or whatever they put in it... But other times they are awesome with enough salsa and well done.. I tried other places and always come back to this one...  So far nobody makes better wings than this place.. Especially the suicide ..spicy..hot... They are awesome!! Always ask for extra salsa ;}"}
{"text":"We love coming to native and love having ALYSSA wait on us. she rocks!!!! The food is always HOT & DELICIOUS!! The atmosphere is upbeat and fun.  Chuck & Lesli S."}
{"text":"Well,  terrible place for anything. We used it love it for game days and other sports event,  but the quality of food got worse every year with each additional location. Food is now mediocre that you can get at any bar place. The waiter took forever to even get a drink. Don't come here if you have any choice. I have been going to this restaurant in the last 10 years but now dreaded coming here for any events."}
{"text":"Great new menu!  I tried the chicken tortilla soup for the first time and loved it!  Wings were perfect and the ranch is great!  Staff are all friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Issue with the service the manger quickly resolved with no questions asked.  Much appreciated he turned what could have been a heated argument into a simple solution!! He saved our business, we'll be back."}
{"text":"My experience at this location was just overall terrible. First I called in ahead for my pick up order. The first person put me on hold and I waited 5 minutes before I hung up and called again and this time I was immediately helped (so there was no reason I should have been on hold so long). They said it would take 20-25 minutes for my order to be ready, I got there 30 minutes afterwards and I was told my pizza was ready but not the wings. The place was almost empty, and I sat for another 10 minutes, when I finally got my food they gave me just 2 sides of ranch for 2 orders of wings and when I asked for more the server looked irritated and took his sweet time grabbing more (and also I asked for blue cheese but got only ranch). When I arrived home (just a 5 minute drive away) my pizza was cold and the wings looked like they'd been sitting out for an hour. Don't bother going to this location."}
{"text":"Had dinner here several times. Food is usually pretty good,  service is fast and friendly.  No complaints, nothing that makes you go wow,  but a decent place to stop at with your family or buddies to grab a beer,  wings, bar food,  watch the sports games and chill."}
{"text":"We've been here for an hour still haven't gotten our food. Waited 25 minutes to get a drink refill, only after stopping the manager and complaining. Will not be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Wings are 1.05 each??!! Come on! Kids meal included a generous portion of literally 10 fries. Ordered the really hot wings, previously called suicide, and were not hot at all. Not even mild. We dined at the Power/Ray location about a year ago and it was a bad experience then too. We gave it another chance and still bad. Not going there again."}
{"text":"Everytime ive come to this native,  it sucks. The servers are never attentive,  food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Yummy WINGS.. waitress was attentive!nice experience!! luv buffalo chips with toppings on the side!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is way too noisy to carry on a conversation. The food is average, the service is a bit on the slow side. Nothing to get excited about and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I saw that there was a veterans day special on November 11th, and considering I live pretty local I thought why not. I came in about 4 o'clock or so and was going to sit at the bar, but it was full, and sat at a table. After about 20 minutes of not being acknowledged to the slightest degree, I left. Its a shame because I come there from time to time because it is local."}
{"text":"Slow and poor service on a Wednesday night with only 3 people at the bar.  The boneless wings were well lets just say I had better frozen wings from a bag. I had the Goose Island IPA on tap which were very good but they didn't have many choices of beer."}
{"text":"Ive been to so many natives in my life and this one is by far my favorite native . Today i came in with 4 of my co workers , got greeted right away by the manger chris kenyon .. He was beyond friendly and so sweet . Then we had one amazing server named kristie , kristie had this friendly and was super fast with our drink and service too . They were so amazing there today i dont think ill ever go to another native EVER as long as kristie and chris are there ill be there every other week"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food is great. Service can be spotty but that's alright. I recently placed an online order and everything went well until I got home and realized they forgot my small pizza. I called them to let them know and they ended refunding my full order just to retain my business. Pretty sweet place and I will continue to frequent"}
{"text":"LUNCH TIME: Brand new restaurant, so as far as cleanliness goes, it's great.  Our server spoke so fast we didn't catch her name, sweet girl,   Hostess pleasant but was sweeping the floor, (try a dry mop)  and did this several times, very near diners, not appetizing,  one thing we  didn't like was the prices.  We went at lunch time,  We had  2 sandwiches, 1 tea, and 1 water, and the baby chocolate bundt cake, (that cost as much as a full bundt cake from a chicken place) with tip it was near $33 for lunch.  This was very pricey for us.  While the food was good, what we got for the price was not.  Sadly this won't be a regular place for us to go."}
{"text":"Called at 4:00pm on Christmas Eve to ask when they closed. The answer was 9:00pm. We arrive at 6:45pm and they are closed. Sign on restaurant was crossed out and said closed at 7:00pm. Last call for food was before 6:45pm.  Absolutely stellar customer service!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Native it's an awesome experience from the time you walk in to the time you leave. It's an awesome atmosphere and they really do cater to the customer."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins to get an appetizer... then the waiter brought me a bud light when I asked twice for a Budweiser... salsa taste like water and they're nachos were regular cheese half ass melted on chips... this place blows..."}
{"text":"Native is awesome. Local Bar food, super cold beers, great specials. my favorite are the honey hot wings :))"}
{"text":"Took my brother here for the first time. I had a great first experience when I brought my wife here I wanted to see if they could duplicate it. Came for lunch, less crowded and ordered a pound of wings to split with some pork queso (delicious by the way we loved that). Rough start though with our waiter. Asked for sweet tea and the waiter brought me what looked like brown tinted sugar water. Incredibly watered down, asked the waiter (reciept said his name Pandalis) if it was sweat tea and he said yes, asked me if I didn't want it he could me me regualr tea. No  remake option, so I already was a skeptic, strike 1. Appetizer got here without utensils. Had to ask Pandalis for silverware strike 2. When our Asian Garlic wings cane they did not taste very good so I asked Pandalis to exchange them out possibly for something else. He just said \"oh, no we can't do that.\" Strike 3, asked for the manager Tyler, couldn't overlook anymore, I just wanted 6 new wings. He apologized made us an awesome batch of sweet tea, a full pound of delicious medium wings when all I asked for was 6 wings to replace the Asian and took off our drinks! He definitely over shadowed the mistakes that happened.  Tyler, my brother was really impressed, he definitely is coming back. Thanks for carrying about your customers. You got yourself a couple regulars!"}
{"text":"Great skinny asian chicken salad. The flat beead appetizer is also a favorite. Nice clean neighborhood restaurant. Good food. Great people. Consistent!"}
{"text":"Came in with my parents and the guy at the front kiosk didnt bother to take our name. We waited for ten minutes and another family came in and they were seated right away. When we finally were seated, we ordered curly fries for an appetizer and the waiter asked \"loaded or curly?\" And failed to tell us that they no longer had the curly fries. Then our iced teas had no ice. When i asked for an extra cup of ice the waitress \"forgot\" right after i told her and she walked directly into the kitchen. Took about 15 minutes to get our ice. We had a total of four servers come to us and each one messed a part of our order up. The waiter who brought our drinks spilled my dad's tea on his shirt, arm, and all over the table. They claimed that this seevice was due to them being busy yet there were plenty of empty tables. This service is the same every time we go. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give this place a star. It doesn't deserve a single one, i enjoyed the place on I-17 and bell. This place sadly has ruined the company name. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one  The food, the service and the management are quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered...and I eat out a few times a week. I feel for anyone who has to go into this place."}
{"text":"Was at the Signal Butte location for the second time in the last 3 months and I will never go back to this location. The first time we went the service was terrible but i thought i would give it another try but no improvement at all . We waited 15 min before waitress came to the table to ask about our drinks and another 30 min to get drinks and order food. When the food arrived 35 min later it wasn't even hot. Extremely disappointed and I will never go back."}
{"text":"For those who have had service problems, based on my experience, you may be dealing with racism.  I will not ever go back to the Laveen NNY location.  It's possible that I could be wrong, yet, I seriously doubt it, with my behind the scenes information. The food seems to be fine!"}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Terrible service.  The absolute worst.  We stopped here for lunch and should have gone next door to Fajitas.  The food was both greasy and dry ( I'm not sure how that was accomplished).  There was only one waitress at the end of the lunch hour.  She was nice, but could not keep up with serving the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Im still on the hunt to find the BEST wings out here in Phoenix...as of now...i really like the wings they serve at Native New Yorker ...not the best wings I've ever had but they are certainly delicious!  so if you guys know of any places where they sell BOMB wings let me know!...This was my first time coming to this place here in Phoenix, and we came on a Sunday, during the football games...and surprisingly is was not packed at all. we got seated right away...the waitress we had though took forever taking our order and serving the food...and it wasn't like it was busy or anything because like i said it wasn't even packed...that was my only complaint :) the people here get really into the games that are going on and they even yell at the TV and it just makes for good entertainment"}
{"text":"Tiffany is one of the best servers we have ever had!! We come weekly and she is by far one of our favorites. She is great! She knows how to make my children smile and laugh, which if your a parent you know how important that is when eating out when younger children. We will request her anytime we go!!"}
{"text":"Best sportsbar in ahwatukee. Very charismatic and funny day bartenders! Great place to watch a game with friends on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Walked Into the restaurant where 7 employees just stood there no one in dining room went to the bar sat down at a table for about 10 minutes and didn't even get acknowledge. There were only about 7 customers in the bar so it wasn't like they were busy. Horrible service. Will never go back to this location because of this..."}
{"text":"Caytlyn ( i hope thats how she spelt it) was absolutely amazing! Best service I've had at Native. I will be back thursday nights!"}
{"text":"A few ladies and I come here almost every other Thursday.  We are always very busy happy with the service here! It's always clean, all of the crew stops and ask how we are doing every time they walk by!  It's a great atmosphere, and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My worst experience ever. Have you tasted your wing sauces? I ordered the mango habanero, spicy honey mustard, and barbecue hot. All of them were a complete, and utter disappointment. Mango habanero and spicy honey mustard both were overpowered with the \"special spicy\" sauce. Tasted like buffalo sauce. Service was poor. Please have your chefs taste your sauces. I thought we'd try Native since our usual joint is Wingstop. WRONG! Never again. We had so much food leftover, we were asked if we wanted to take out.  NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"A good place to go after work for wings and a drink. It's a typical sports bar but they have some great deals on wings and lots of flavors as well. Their menu really has something for everyone from pasta to burgers to pizza---lots of choices. The service was slacking a bit...my friend asked for a certain type of beer and the server had to go ask if they carried it which they did. She also took quite a while to take our order in the first place. Maybe she was new, who knows. The overall verdict on the food was good although their \"spiciest\" wings weren't really too spicy at all, very upsetting!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, ghost, honey hot and tater tots with queso...beer is always good!"}
{"text":"We like coming here - its a sports bar full of all diff kinds of fans. Best place for pizza, beer and a crowd."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken salad and  breakfast burger with tator tots. Order was to go.   SALAD. They did not put in the dressing.  Chicken tasted  pre frozen. No seasoning at all. None.  The side pita bread that came with the salad was so hard it should of been called a pita chip.    Burger.  The meat did taste fresh , I'll give them that.  But again like the chicken no seasoning a all none.  Very blan meat.  As far as the hashbrown on the burger picture a Mc D's hashbrown.  Not made from a fresh potato.  Made from frozen than fried.    All in all will I would not recommend this place for the food so far."}
{"text":"The name, service, atmosphere and food have changed and not for the better. I have lived in the Valley for over 20 years and the Native New Yorker used to be the go to place for wings.  The remodel done a couple of years ago in the Signal Butte location makes this place look more like a cafeteria than a restaurant and the quality of food and service have taken a significant decline.  Received the wrong wing order and despite complaint, the waitress insisted it was correct.   The bowling alley pizza billed as New York pizza tasted like it was made out of a Jiffy box.  It was definitely not New York or New York style pizza.  To cap it off, the waiter brought our credit card and check to another table before realizing it was ours.  Will not be returning. They got it all wrong with the changes and shortcuts.  Filthy tables, chairs, doors and sticky menus."}
{"text":"Our server Jenna was horrible! It wasn't busy at all but the only time we saw her was when she took our order, when we had to ask after 20 min for water (she took another waitresses waters), and when she brought the check. She was rude every time she came to our table except of course when she brought the check. Needless to say we didn't want to tip her so we gave her tip to the waitress who got her drinks stolen."}
{"text":"They fixed the WiFi! New menu is interesting but miss tue and thur wing nights. Best beer taps in town cold and clean. Friendly staff. My goto spot for sports, beer and wings."}
{"text":"Good for you if you'd like to be sick and miss work. Two people from my party who ordered the same food became ill. Gave them a shot for lunch even after I saw a bad review regarding food quality and food poisoning. Sure enough I've been sick to my stomach for over 48 hours and I'm on medicine.   Would not give them another chance."}
{"text":"Bad customer service! Never going back! It took forever to receive our food while other people that got there after us got there food before we did."}
{"text":"This place is actually really great. Sorry it's not \"native\" enough for real new yorkers, but what do you think you're gonna get in Arizona? The chicken strippers are delicious, my buffalo burger was great, and my waiter was a good guy."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my last review...The manager Tara reached out to me to discuss the issues that I had encountered on my visit. She was very nice and apologetic and gave me a pretty reasonable explanation for the issue with the supplier of their wings as well as their staffing/employee issues. I hope that thru my complaint (someone has to or problems never will get addressed or fixed ) that they will turn things around. I will give them another chance and hopefully the problems will be resolved and the service, attitudes and the food quality will get better. Thanks Tara for reaching out to me personally, I do appreciate it....."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place we always get good service everybody knows us talks to us its nice I like the environment food is delicious 5 stars"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place barely gets three stars now.    The good: -Wings.  They have always been good, and are still excellent.  Great special (49 cents per wing) on Sundays during football.   -Smoking area.  Although I quit years ago, this place has an awesome patio/bar area for smokers.  Climate controlled (misters and heat lamps) for summer/winter and new TVs, which are great for watching sports.  The bad: -Management sucks.  The service is chaotic on NFL Sundays, and I asked one of the managers walking by for a napkin, since the food runner didn't bring me one with my wings.  The manager with slicked back hair and the tatts on his forearms blew me off.  My waitress was overworked, but cool.  The staff has to wear these lame jerseys now, which gives this place a more corporate feel, similar to BWW. -Prices.  They have gone up significantly.  Better values at many other places in Tempe.  The rest of the food is mediocre.   -No more trivia.  They quit providing video trivia/poker.  Might as well go to BWW if you are looking for a wing joint that has trivia/poker.  We used to play poker at Native in groups out on the patio, but no longer."}
{"text":"Many, many years ago my dear old pappy told ne \"Son, you can't polish a turd!\".  Well tonite I experienced that first hand at Native.  We were seated quickly, but that's where the good news ends.  We sat and waited and waited and waited for close to 20 minutes.  Nobody asked for our drink order .... nobody asked if we had been helped .... the manager was standing next to us. and talking to servers over us .... but we were obviously wearing our cloak of invisibility.    Finally, after a group of four that walked in and was immediately seated, and instantly was greeted by a server, and had there drink orders taken .... we gave up and left.  Nobody even noticed or asked why .... including that \"Manager\" that was still standing next to our table when we got up and left.     I really hoped this place had changed with the new owners, but NO IT HASN'T!!!  So we left this turd unpolished, and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town.   I have been to a few of their locations and this is the best one.   Great service.   Food almost always arrives quickly even when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Always great to come in here. Food is great and staff is friendly. Our server Falcone was extremely helpful and curteous. Love watching our Cardinals win here!"}
{"text":"I went in for some wings on the Tuesday special.  When i went to the bar to order the waitress gave me my bill and it seemed high so i asked how much were the wings and i thought it was .35 cents today, she stated that the .35 is dine in only and you have to purchase a drink.  I stated that I had ordered wings from the bar before on Tuesday and the price was only .35 and i didn't have to purchase a drink.  She stated that some of the wait staff may have done that before but the policy was dine-in only and i'm only doing what i was told to do.  To make it so bad this same waitress was the same person who had taken my order before and gave it to me at the .35 cent price.  I asked to speak with the manager.  When the General Manager came over i explained about the inconsistent practices and she peered at me like a deer in the headlights.  The other stupid thing she mentioned is that if i had decided to eat in they would only box up so many wings...so that means if i ordered 20 wings and only ate 6 they would only box up 8 (for example)of them and i'd have to throw the other 6 out or eat them... that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.  I told her i wouldn't be back, I'd go to BW3 or someplace that don't have these ridiculous rules over some wings... smh.  I won't be back....  btw the wings weren't good.  The parmesan wings had no flavor what's so ever, all the wings were small...would have been better off at BW3"}
{"text":"Service was good, attentive and pleasantly polite.  Wings were so so and the sliders were decent."}
{"text":"Took friends from out of town here when they didn't want Mexican.  Time they take some duct tape and fix the seats in the booths.  Asked waitress for 'another minute' to look at menus, she rushed us so at beginning.  Then 15 minutes go by, and nobody.  We tracked down another waiter to send her over.  Food (club sandwich, chinese chicken salad, sliders, BBQ) edible but nothing special. No drink refills offered, guess if you don't order alcohol you're ignored.  We loved this place when it was Ausler's, but won't be going back.  Dirty, worn and scattered service, we'll make the drive elsewhere in future."}
{"text":"So disappointed!! The wings there are now BREADED! I'm from NY originally and wings are not supposed to be breaded. I really hope they change back to how they used to be or I will not be going there again. Extremely upset!"}
{"text":"Brought our whole family here. There were 13 of us. Becky our server and Kari took very good care of us. Everyone's food was great. We love this place.  All of us beer drinking adults love the really cold beer here. Congratulations to Becky and Kari for the feat job they did.   This is a new review. We had great service. Our server was John. He did a great job. He was very attentive. We also had the manager,Justin stop by to make sure all was good with us. Cathrine also checked on us & got Gary some more ice tea. This place is wonderful."}
{"text":"Shannon the bar tender is so nice.  We enjoyed dry rub chicken strippers with awesome mojitos!"}
{"text":"Believe this place used to be a different restaurant. We sat in bar and had a few drinks, appetizer, and dinner.  All our food came out as fast and hot.  Tasty food and plenty of options for a few of us.  Waitress was fun and great at he job.  we will be back again"}
{"text":"Water is nasty!!! Waitress very Unfriendly  Slow service! I would never go back!"}
{"text":"First time in since they reopened. Stopped in to grab some wings to go. There were no guests in the restaurant and about 6 in the bar.   I sat at the bar where a guest had brought in a large portable speaker and had it blasting over the in house music. I like music and I like it loud, but this was too loud. My ears were ringing.   I spoke with the bar tender about naked wings, since I am low-carb. Placed my order and wings came out 25 mins later. ALL breaded. When I pointed this out to the tender, she just took the wings and headed into the back. Didn't say anything to me. No sorry, no be right back, nothing.   I also noticed I had been charge $2 over the pice in the menu. Tender seemed annoyed and had a manager fix it. Neither she or the manager said anything to me about this. No sorry, no nothing. Dropped off the new tab without a word.  Finally, new wings come out, tender dropps them off and doesn't say a word. Ugh, 5 of them are still breaded and no ranch, oh well. I pay and cut my losses. I was hoping for a quick in & out from a very slow restaurant. Instead, I spent an hour with an empty glass while going deaf to boombox music. Not a word of acknowledgement from the tender or manager. A simple sorry can go a long way.  Despite the poor reputation, I gave them a chance... I won't be back."}
{"text":"I never write reviews because I think it's a waste of time but I feel like I need to be heard. First off if I could give zero stars I would . I went here for dinner with my wife enjoying a what I wanted nice meal. The waiter took 15 mins to even get my drinks because they were to busy talking to other waiters. Then my food came out cold which was so sad because I though native was known for \"wings\". While we were eating the all the works come around a table and say it was someone's last day. I mean that's nice good luck , but then they threw whip cream in her face and said it was a tradition. I'm sorry but what kind of place has a tradition like that and while I'm eating you throw this in her face and she screams and everyone is around video taping this. I would be ashamed as a manger to have such children working for my restaurant. I know refuse to eat at this location. The next day , I tried calling to speak a head manger. While the first person answered and by the way they were just as rude and were laughing while answering the phone. I asked for a manger and the person said okay let me get you one . Not even a second after saying that they hung up. The services is terrible and there is nothing but children working here. They don't know how to have RESPECT for people who are eating. I will now drive out of my way to another native to avoid this one. Trust me it's not worth your money. I mean if you like waiting for your drink for 15 mins and having cold food and seeing someone get hit in the face with whip cream this will be the place for you. For me I found this to be the worst dine in experience of my life."}
{"text":"Seems to have gone down hill since the start. The food is typically not hot enough and service is sub-par. There was one waitress in the bar that really knew how to provide great service, but I don't seem to see her much any more. Some one should light a fire under someone's ....to get things going again.   It is one of the only sit down restaurants in the area so it should be packed all the time. I love the bar area, but now that I have a kid I have to sit in the \"family\" section which is pretty lame and a little more run down looking.  On the bright side the wings are great as expected and the pizza is decent, much better than other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks on a weekend with friends. Very disappointing!  The margaritas tasted like lemon lime ade! Got the potato chips as an appetizer; you can get them with various dry rubs. They were tasty but not worth going out of your  way for. Wings are decent. ..just decent. If you are looking for good food and drinks. ..keep driving!"}
{"text":"We live next door and thought we'd give it a try. I didn't believe ALL the negative reviews and thought I'd check it out seeing as how it was just across the street. Well... we were not greeted in the front and figured out the bar was on the left, where we sat for 3 minutes being ignored by the bartender and two servers before deciding to head out to the patio to enjoy the sunset. I decided that after waiting a total of 5 minutes and being passed by twice by our waitress on the patio we would just leave and head down to Gordon Biersch, so we did....Don't bother, all these negative reviews are true... It's too bad because they have a HUGE customer base built in with the two complexes next door. Show you care people, it's $$$..."}
{"text":"Wings and pizza were both really good! Ordered take out at a really busy time during a football game and it was ready in 15 minutes and they were very polite. I'd do it again."}
{"text":"I think they were a bit understaffed the night I was there. Cold wings and it took over an hour to get them out to us. No big deal."}
{"text":"Yep, I obviously like wings. I keep going back. Service isn't the best but the wings sure are pretty good and so is the pizza. I guess if you don't care whether or not you have drinks to wet your whistle this place is great. Good thing the wings are cheap on Tuesdays. Really makes up for the sucky service when the bill comes."}
{"text":"The veggie calzone was well prepared and tasty. My colleagues' salad looked good. Service was courteous and prompt. Would come back again! The New York Style cookie w/ ice cream is great!"}
{"text":"Meh on the atmosphere. WHOA to the food.  Went here on a Saturday night with a friend to grab some grub before going out. It was a nice night so I opted for outdoor seating. I did this after seeing the interior of the place. Per the name, I expected to see a place decked out in New York memroblia, photos, newspapers, jerseys, etc. but sadly it looked the inside of a Pizza Hut. Nothing exciting on the walls, just booths and tables. Although the space was big and the bar looked pretty stacked, I wasn't impressed with the inside.  On the back patio, which had iron tables and chairs with a bar playing the Giants game (there's the festivness I was looking for) we ordered a side of Honey BBQ and spicy honey mustard boneless wings. OH SWEET MERCY, they were good. I love me some boneless wings and they were killer. I drank the kool aid and I am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings.  For dinner I ordered the California Clucker. Chibata bread, grilled chicken, bacon, a mayo of types, and avacado. Served with wide-cut steak fries, it was delish. THe bacon was a little too crispy for me, but the avacado was just smushy enough. I couldn't finish and saved half for a late night snack. Even hours later I was 100& satisfied.   I'd go back here on a wing special night and just eat my little heart out."}
{"text":"Big disappointment today. Kitchen was very slow. My son got the strippers with habenero mango sauce and he said there was not a hint of sweetness on it. I requested cole slaw and was given a few tablespoons of the most vinegary cole slaw I have ever tasted.   Other son enjoyed his stripper meal with no complaints. He got the medium sauce.  So perhaps whoever is charged with mixing sauces and the cold slaw isn't on point today. I do know that a tiny scoop of cold slaw in lieu of fries is absurd."}
{"text":"I love Natives wings. The reason this place gets 3 stars is due to service. It really needs to be stepped up. I took a party of 10 here for the Tuesday wing special. After waiting 45 minutes, we were told that they were sorry but they couldn't handle a party of that size. We had to drive 20 minutes to the next closest location in order to be served. I've been back to this location since this happened, and it's been somewhat better, but it still has room for improvement."}
{"text":"One on the worst places i have ate while living in az. 5 people ate for $65.00 what a joke, $5 for a small plate of fries,$9 for 12 wings and so on. Food quality was horrible and so was the price. Wish i would have read some reviews before going, if this is a franchise they are not keeping up just hope others are not like this. Someone from the health department needs to be called ."}
{"text":"Bartender Ashley is constantly in motion and has never missed my order, in fact as soon as I walk she will ask if I want the usual. Pleasant and attentive, she even mentioned free chips as  I enjoyed the usual. The food is great but she makes the experience a good time, every time..."}
{"text":"This place will not last if they do not add TVs and get the sound system upgraded so we can here the sports"}
{"text":"We like going their with the kiddos. They love the food and they have this Trivia Game called Buzz Time which is really cool . The way it works; they give you a video game like device through which you log on to the main TV. The entire restaurant can play and they even keep your scores ( if you score high enough). So my kids are totally hooked."}
{"text":"Yes Alexis is awesome. Watching her work and remembering all those beers out of the tap. She's good. Great personality to boot!! Thanks for a great experience my first time in here!!"}
{"text":"We had a Great family lunch today at Native!! Our server Shanna was amazing and the food was outstanding. I have never had a bad experience here it is a great family friendly place to eat and I also respect the fact that they always give back to the schools in the community whenever they can! Thank You Native and Shanna for a great afternoon!!!!"}
{"text":"I give two starts mainly because I was there last night and I guess the bartender forgets to card people. I didn't get carded and one group of people didn't get carded who did NOT even look old enough to drink."}
{"text":"Gross!! Someone brought a dog into the restaurant!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE dogs, have 3. But I do NOT want them in the restaurant on wing night!  Waiter & food deliverer (aka manager) sat at the table with them. A little a \"to\" local for us, thinking they do not want new business.  That's fine, Sidelines serves their wings grilled! We'll be their regulars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my family and ordered the boneless wings. I went on a wednesday so there was a special for a pound of wings. We had a super cool server who goes by \"Suki\". She made the whole experience super fun. Ill be going back again :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place!  Not only do they have great food but the service is amazing!  The bartender amber is so nice and she has great customer service skills,  if u come to this location u will leave with a great experience from her! She is just so awesome!  The general manager Megan is great as well!  If i need anything she's right there for me to make my visit good!  I love coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"First Time here .  Great prices, Fanatsic management!!! Just messed on my order but so pleased to offer compensation and many alopogises for the inconvenience. We will be coming back solely on service. Thank you to our server, Bryan and manager, irvil. Perso nl preferences would say that even when I'm sobber, ill enjoy every minute of the Wings"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while as a local watering hole and sometimes it can be great, and sometimes it can be a shit show.   I have to be honest and say every time I have met Liv at the bar the service has been spot on. Not only did she provide speedy service but she was working the whole bar and killing it while still smiling and having small talk.   As a bartender and a caring individual please do us all a favor and hire more people like Liv.   By the way the new menu rocks."}
{"text":"WINGS 101 1) very small not much meat at all which was quite a dissapointment 2)although small they were cooked perfectly.nice crispiness to them and drenched in sweet barbecue sauce (my sauce of choice was Strawberry HOT) no emphasis on the HOT 3)very quick prompt service and a decent atmosphere  4) the MAJOR DOWNFALL-a pitcher of budweiser cost $8.50! But they do have bottles of corona for $2 a pop which is a better deal"}
{"text":"Love natives, although the last  several times Ive been at this location the food has been horrible. I got a pizza that had so much cheese on it I could not taste anything else. I'd rather driver further out to Glendale then this location.  Besides the food the workers are usually good with service!"}
{"text":"Another wing shop, not bad but for me..., little awkward because I did not understand the flavors.  Had some wings, ordered a good microbrew and watched a GREAT GAME(Denver won !).  THANKS FOR BEING THERE..."}
{"text":"Just a quick review at a favorite restaurant. The new Philly Cheesesteak is very very good. I subbed swiss for queso, that's just me. TJ was a great server, very informative and helpful. As always the wings are terrific, Glenn had asiago parmesan and ginger teriyaki. Reverse happy hour starts at 9:30!"}
{"text":"They leave the roll up door between the bar and the smoking patio wide open so you can enjoy the cigarette smoke while you eat."}
{"text":"The food is great and always changes! Being a regular there I was disappointed to find fruit flys in my vodka! Good thing I watch Bar Rescue to know why there were floating bugs in my drink! I will still go there, but only for the food and beer!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings for me and a burger for my wife.  The burger came with what appeaered to be a dirty string from a mop head on it.  They took the food back and appologized and still tried to charge us for our meals.....  two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Do you love long waits for cold food? Well you have come to the right place. Native Grill and Wings will not disappoint. Make sure you have an hours worth of material to converse about before the food comes out, you will need it. Then just when you are about ready to complain the wings magically appear. Don't worry, they are cold. Just like we all love them. Good thing it took an hour to prepare them, that way they had time to refrigerate them before bringing them to the table. Honestly I don't know how they could improve such an impeccable dining experience. I'll be back:"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Good food and GREAT service. Waitress was LIZ and she was exceptional in service and personality. Served party of 12 with ease."}
{"text":"Wasn't great service, food was mediocre, and the Calzone/Wings I had weren't amazing! Didn't accommodate my grandfather who is in a walker and the waitress was very rude about our situation. Wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"They Close at 11pm was sitting at the table at 950pm and was told I couldn't order food, asked if I could atleast order wings since it is what they sell. Waitress with attitude stated they were out of Wings. Last time I walk through those doors. Submitted a complaint with headquarters, No response!!!!! This place used to be the spot what happened? SMH 2-5-18"}
{"text":"Good food, amazing wings, laid back place to grab a bite and get in and out. Nothing fancy. Great service from Dakota, sports games always on."}
{"text":"I am a Native New Yorker (Buffalo, NY) and was pleased to see a true Buffalo original, Beef on Weck.  This a very simple sandwich to make, I was very skeptical at first, but I ate and was not disappointed.  You can order a beef like sandwich anywhere, however when combined with a salted kummelweck roll stacked with slow roasted beef and dipped in aujus, its a sandwich of pure manliness that goes with any beer.  In AZ, this sandwich is the closest thing I'll get to tailgating at the Ralph on a cool fall day without actually being there.    I also ordered wings and I thought the wing itself was good but the Medium sauce was too bitter and left a tangy aftertaste.  Medium sauce for chicken wings should not taste like this, they did apply the proper amount to the wing which is a plus.  Why is this important?  Too much sauce makes sloppy eating, but its your preference in the end.  One thing I really did like was the multiple sauce options for wings, theres something for everyone.    Service was fair, relatively quick and friendly, nothing out of the ordinary.  Nice TV's and environment for casual food.    Final note, this a good establishment for corporate wings.  The prices are fair and I love that they offer various style wing specials M-W depending on the day.  Not too many establishments do this.  Don't believe me, check out Buffalo Wild Wings and their prices.  Compared hand down, Native New Yorker is the best.  Because I am from NY, I cannot in good faith give Native New Yorker 5 stars, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, the .5 star is the beef on weck, try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Great food great service!  Our server name was Angelique . She was great!  We noticed how busy she got within mins she went from 2 tables to 10 , but handled it very well!  . Even with her being busy everything was perfect !  Food was out in time drinks were always refilled!  Think we found our new fav waitress! Thank you !"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been there about three times. We have had one good waiter and two that were not-so-great. One waiter seemed overwhelmed and nervous, even though he had only a few tables. He spoke so fast, we could barely understand him. The food at Native Grill & Wings is only so-so. As a vegetarian, I am limited in what I can eat there. I have ordered a dinner salad that had strawberries, apples, nuts and cheese. It was fresh enough, but the vinagrette was very tart. My husband has tried their wings, their pizza, and a sandwich. He was unimpressed with all of it. Also, it's usually very loud in there, whether the dining room is full or not. There are always families there with screaming kids who are undisciplined and running around. I realize the staff can't do anything about that. The restaurant floor is often dirty - littered with napkins, food, etc. The last time we dined there was in March. We won't be going back. The atmosphere is too chaotic, and the service and the food are just mediocre. There are plenty of other better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This place is my go to bar. Good bar food and cheap beer during happy hour and football season. The service could be better but im not the type of person to complain too much about service when i just want a pint or two."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Laura tonight who did a great job.  When you have a tough day and really want to unwind having someone provide excellent service with a friendly smile and great attitude helps turn the day around.  She was the highlight of a very tough day and seeing her smile was a turning point.  The three martini's that followed didn't hurt either!  Ordered the stripper chicken (boneless wings basically) with two flavors followed by a burger we split with potato chips.  Excellent job and my compliments to the managers for hiring real talent that I wanted to steal for our business.    Enjoyed it immensely.     Thanks   RJ."}
{"text":"Fries were good....well that's about all I can say.  Service was extremely poor.  Staff either not trained  or not supervised.  Wing sauce tasted like it was from the bottom of a bottle that hadn't been shaken.  Overall very very poor.   What happened to Native New Yorker?  It used to be great...not anymore."}
{"text":"A man with some cool guy glasses served us. Realest nigga in the game. Homie got his shades jacked by a short fiesty woman...good sport about it 11/10 DEFINITELY. The dude also has his beer game on point with some fire recommendations. . Recommend Tom when arriving here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time. Our server Dominique was AWESOME food was great. We will definitely be coming back again. :-) :-)"}
{"text":"I've been going to native for wings for years and I'm never disappointed. I got take out today and the girl helping me was very kind and helpful. The food was very good and was ready on time. Will come back to this location again!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  We visited the restaurant on a Sunday evening with our children.  The restaurant was about 3/4 full.  There was no wait.  We ordered our food within 10 minutes of being seated.  Right away the drinks and salads came out.  15 minutes later the waitress informed us that the kitchen was backed up and the food would be ready in a little bit.  We sat......we waited.  20 minutes later we noticed that two tables by us were seated.  Our waitress stopped by again and informed us the food would be out shortly.  Another 20 minutes go by and we notice that 1 of the tables seated by us, who was seated 35 minutes after us, received their food (wings).  10 minutes later, we notice another table seated 35 minutes after us received their food (a whole platter of wings).  We also noticed that the manager had personally delivered their food.  We told our waitress that we weren't disappointed in her, but more so at the manager who did NOT stop by our table at all.  At this point our daughter was in tears with hunger pains.  She stated, \"I will never pick this restaurant again!\"  ONE HOUR AFTER ORDERING OUR FOOD, and after asking for the manager, we were informed by our waitress that the restaurant was OUT OF THE FOOD that we ordered.  WHAT?  The manager NEVER came over to our table.  NEVER offered an apology.  NEVER spoke to us.  We left the restaurant with 3 hungry children, one of which was crying.  We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"We went there and had a drink and some wings. We are from the East coast and have been to the place that has the original wings. They were okay but the chicken is pressed and seemed very chicken nugget for the boneless and the sauce wasn't that great on the regular bone in traditional. Maybe we are just picky. We wanted to try their pizza but the ppl behind us complained the dough wasn't cooked. We aren't sure if we want to go back or not"}
{"text":"Terrible service, incredibly rude, my friend almost broke a glass slamming it on the bar trying to get bartenders attention while she played on her phone. With 6 people in the whole place the entire bar top was also dirty, chunks of food and liquid everywhere."}
{"text":"Apparently, it is above management to deliver a menu. We arrived in the bar for lunch and the server was busy elsewhere out of the room. The excessively chubby manager on duty walked through, looked at us and said our server would be with us shortly (which I guess is better than nothing). I ended up getting our own menus, where we ordered their excessively salty food. We ate wings and a turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"The wings and tots were served cold, it was not even crowded. I do know how this place stays open."}
{"text":"Glendale Native seems to want to make a change for the better, new menu, new don't cook it until you order it - but what the heck - no ribs, no steak, no specials on Saturdays? And how can plain home syle potato chips cost the same as the loaded Buffalo Chips? Many waitresses and waiter need to take lessons from Jessica. This place still needs to make major improvements on the front greeting desk - they stil seem clueless many times."}
{"text":"The service is awful, the staff is beyond rude. Plus nobody seems to know what they are doing. I have actually eaten there ONCE and the food was sub-par. The other THREE times we gave this place a chance the service was awful. Waited 20min in the bar area and not one server came to help us. Poor staff!!! Never again. Save yourself the frustration and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Dark dungeon of a bar with a maze of entrance and exits. The food is pretty standard for a \"Bar and grill\". Boneless wings pretty bad, mozzarella sticks cold and hardly worth ordering. Came during happy hour on a Monday night, the music was terrible. Something played that apparently no one had control over. Plenty of Tvs to catch your game, but the lack of locally owned and Operated,  robot of a corporate bar won't be having us back again any time soon. The bartender was gone from behind the bar well before, and after happy hour was over, then wouldn't let me order my beer she was missing for. Nice try Native, you are closer than other places, but won't be back unless things are different."}
{"text":"Worst calzone ever.  Came here for dinner on July 29 and I have to say it was horrible.  We were pleasantly surprised that the stated 20 minute wait for a table was closer to 5 minutes, so it felt like we were off to a good start.  That's pretty much where it ends.  Our waitress was indifferent at best, had zero personality and obviously didn't want to be there.  I ordered a calzone and boy was that a mistake.  I am pretty sure they simply chopped up pieces of Oscar Mayer bologna and ham and shoved in there, and then spooned in a bit of canned tomato sauce and maybe a couple of tablespoons of cheese.  It was tasteless and dry - and the filling was the good part.  I have never had a worse crust.  I think a tube of Pillsbury pre-made dough would have been an improvement over what they dropped on the plate.  Oh well, at least my beer was good.  Doubtful I'll return - just too many other, better places to go."}
{"text":"There aren't that many places in the area for takeout that's American food.  Native New Yorker is usually my default take out for wings when I don't feel like cooking because of its location.  I have to say I'm a bigger fan of Wing Stop.  Cons: -The wings are hit or miss.  Sometimes they  can be soggy with no crunch and depending on the cook the sauces can be thin or too saucy.  -The price is a tad too high.  There are wing specials but during times that are odd.  Pros: -  Takeout is quick  -  The staff is always super nice  -  The salads are getting better and taste great.  -  There is outdoor seating."}
{"text":"worst experience ever!!!! We waited 30 plus minutes for our food, the waitress \"kept checking\", when the food finally came, my burger was over cooked and dry. I said something and she said do you want me to put your order in again? I said no I'm not waiting another half hour for food. She said she told the manager (which I did see) the manager never once came to the table to apologize, did not offer to take anything off the bill. She just handed us the bill and I said your not even going to offer to take care of my burger? She said she's sorry, went to the manager again and then gave us the check with no discount. When I left I told the hostess what happened and she said, yeah management sucks here, that's why I put my two weeks in. If the franchise owner cares about this business at all you need to fire the skinny blond lady that is so called \"manager\"!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times and the service has always been good but all the food I've eaten has been pretty bootys if yah know what I mean! The pizza is on point though"}
{"text":"The environment is sport bar / family style. The food to me is average and pretty typical of a chain style restaurant. The service here has improved greatly with the addition of more capable wait staff thank you Ericka. The stores cleanliness is nice and the overall appearance is enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food seems to get worse with each visit.  Perhaps that is why this place is empty most of the time.  A great clean atmosphere with mobile gaming units and TVs everywhere make this a good place to kill some time or watch a game.  I think overpriced beer for the area and a lack of drink specials probably keep the crowds away, but I give them credit for bringing in entertainment to try and make this place a fun destination.  Hopefully they'll get the kitchen situation fixed at some point and consider some specials to help this place reach it's potential.  That or replace it with an Applebee's so people will go there!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for the small sized portions. I found myself looking for the other half of my food and had to go home and eat more....Got the loaded fries with pork.  THink they forgot the loaded part."}
{"text":"We are super happy you have brand new karaoke DJs on Friday and saturday.  Their sound system is so good and they are very friendly.  Your drink promotions and great food make your place the complete package!!   See you all soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is totally hit and miss.  There are times when you don't even want to come back to this place because the service was so bad. However, the \"majority\" of the time they have pretty good food. You can never go wrong with their chicken wings, steak sandwich or bow-tie chicken Alfredo."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star because they have beer. The food tastes like it was microwaved.  Definitely doesn't live to its name."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Our server Michael G. was friendly, attentive and professional.  We go in the restaurant on a regular basis.  The service is always top notch.  Thanks Michael!  You keep us coming back every week."}
{"text":"The wings are good, the beer is cold, and it's not Applebees. That alone makes it a four star place in my opinion.   It's Laveen. Our choices for a \"sit down\" meal are very limited, and personally, I hate Applebees."}
{"text":"Food was good, I was there for father's day but they're food timing is horrible. I ordered my dinner part 10 minutes after my appetizer and the main meal came 1 minute afterwards. I purposely try and time this myself and they can't get it right."}
{"text":"We are here on a Thursday before a movie. We ordered 2 burgers, it took them 25 minutes to bring out the first one, I'm still waiting for the second one because they dropped it on the floor......UPDATE: 40 minutes to get my burger.  The waiter was about a 2/5, never got a refill but knocked of half the price because my wife made him. I'm normally not that critical but both burgers were not very tasty. 14 dollars and 1 1/2 hours later we will never go back again. We are running to catch our movie...."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a to go order and stood there for 20 minutes before anyone even bothered to notice me and then another 10 minutes before I was even greeted. Needless to say the food was cold by the time it was handed to me.   It's not even busy in here, empty seats everywhere.  I'm flabbergasted at the level of unprofessionalism and lack of organization. I will for sure be leaving a bad review on every social media site available."}
{"text":"Wings are dry, food is ok, management is terrible.  For the price you can get better food if you venture out of the Foothills. I don't come here often, but recently both the service and food have been lacking.  Tip for management: If there's a problem with the bill that's the customer's fault, tell them instead of belittling them.  Won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for 15 minutes.. waitresses have been walking by us the whole time not asking if we need drinks. The lady who's area it is has served the table behind us about 2-3 times now and walked by about 10 times still no drinks. We asked if we could get our order taken and have a new waitress to a waitress walking by.. all she said was \"oh\" and rolled her nasty little eyes. This place is empty for us to not get service! The \"oh\" lady got the manager and she got us drinks and an appetizer on the house.. she handled it very well. And our new waitress was nice. But this place still gets one star because of the attitudes of the waitresses."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to native on Sat. Nov. 4th around 730. We sat in the bar area, out on the patio. They were really busy with just 1 bartender and 1 waitress.  Nobody knew how to turn up the volume on the outside tv. So we watched football in silence.  We had to keep getting up to get our own beers. The staff was really nice but overwhelmed.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Wings were better than average but the wait staff is what puts this place over the edge. Great service today and they had several big groups. No easy feat.  I liked it and will be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is awesome and the service is great!  The amazing Craig took care of us from beginning to end and was positive and upbeat!  My friend said their Caesar salad was the best she's had in a long time!  I had the chicken strippers and salad and they were great !  We shared the baby bundt cake and it is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Top notch wings. Came here looking for some good wings and left full and happy with money well spent.  We came on a Tuesday and it was packed.  It would seem $0.55 wings really brings people to the yard. We started off with some yummy loaded fries that his the pre meal spot that was just the perfect thing to start the night.. Then the wings which were delish. With flavors like Strawberry and Buffalo, it was a taste medley in my mouth.  So many things on the menu we shall return to try other things this yummy spot has to offer."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. The food is delicious, especially the chicken  bacon flatbread! Nothing beats wings, flatbread, and a michelada after a long day at work. I am so grateful they built a Native in Buckeye! Staff is always friendly and working hard. They always make it  a point to say hello, even when they are not our servers."}
{"text":"I love this place on game day! I've been coming here on and off for years. Sunday football and wings here are the best. Friday nights me and my wife come here for date night. Great atmosphere, great food and fairly cheep drinks. I highly recommend this  place."}
{"text":"I called in a order for 18 wings.....they said they would be ready in 15 minutes....I got there in 25 minutes and asked the hostess if my order was ready (which she had other orders ready and waiting)...she directed me to the bar then asked the bartender if my order was ready. She said she would look....... then after waiting 8 minutes, 8 minutes more a manager came up and said it would be an additional 10 minutes for 1 wing! HAA!!!  I told her forget the 1 wing and would like my order. She went to the back then after 3 minutes more came back and told me they threw out my order because of not having the 1 wing...told me if I would wait for the full order they would get it right...no discount mind you, would not have even wanted by now......I walked out...Big thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"We like it here. We would give it 5/5 if always great service.  It's been a bit spotty at times. With that said, the food is Great and the wings always yummy!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time here.  Food is good and so is service.  Take advantage of the specials and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had lunch today here and not only were the strippers great,  the service was amazing!  Amber the bartender was very attentive and very friendly!  The manager on duty kari was very friendly as well!  Great music,  great atmosphere and great place to go for a quick lunch and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday with a group of 10 people. Ordered a few of their 12 pack of traditional wings and it was pretty good. We choose 6 different flavors.  Good:     +service, she was awesome!      +price for food 12pack traditional/ around 7.50       +late night happy hour       + ambiance for weekday       +fries and onion rings appetizer from happy hour Could improve:      -they dont label the wing flavors, so it was difficult for server to let us know which one was which      -one of the flavors tasted like nothing! (Cant say which one..wasn't labeled)       -military discount only on some items...not the whole bill!!!!!"}
{"text":"My buddy proposed to his gf tonight and the management totally went out of their way to make it awesome. Steve is the best. We showed up and didn't have the equipment we needed to play a song on the piano and he totally rushed to Walmart and bought it for us in time. That's beyond the call of duty."}
{"text":"New to town and have already been here twice. Food is on point and even busy the service is great"}
{"text":"Their food is the same poor quality over priced expensive crap as you received at native new yorker. Their wings are small and priced by weight.   They can rebrand themselves as much as they want but until they start making items fresh and not frozen they will die. They may stay open since we get an influx of snowbirds and catus league folk.   When Oregano's opens it is going to destroy them. Oregano's has the best wings in the valley because they cook them fresh. They don't half cook them like Native and every other bar around does.   If you want bearable wings go to Austins. Ironically its in the same spot as native new yorker was in.  If you can hold out a couple months wait for Oregano's."}
{"text":"All im there for is  cold.drinks and pretty girls.native has both :-) servers are hot.bartender i think her name Michelle.very attractive. Bar food is ok.im.more comfortable around  my chicano people but this.place is cool when.im.on.this.side of.town"}
{"text":"Went in at noon, not very busy.  Ordered a Patty Melt and two orders of \"homemade\" meatballs to go.  About 10 minutes later, bartender says, \"bad news, all out of meatballs\".  How can you be out of \"homemade\" anything at noon, especially one week after grand opening.  My instincts tell me they were out because none were delivered.  Might be homemade, just not at this home.......  First and last visit to Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"Love this place my favorite is an order of a half pound of hot boneless wings and a side of fries! Although the service could use a little improvement the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Well - they have food that is sometimes decent.   An order of cheese sticks came out without the cheese on the inside being melted. I politely asked them if they can put it back in the microwave where it came from and they were happy to do so. You could tell the food wasn't just prepared. Chicken wings are pretty good but awfully small compared to many other establishments.   Service has been hit or miss in the 3 times I have gone here (You got to give everyone a fair chance right?). I think for what they offer and at the prices they offer it for, you would be better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible! We tried this place for the first time tonight. We ordered food to go for a relaxing night in. We ordered 2 entrees and 2 deserts and it came to $45. For the price I had high expectations. I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. It actually took 35 minutes so I had to stand and wait for the order to be completed. The service from the young lady at the front was awful. She was not welcoming or friendly. The worst part was the actual food. We ordered the skyscraper burger with onion rings and the BBQ pork sliders with fries. The burger itself was okay but it came with 4 small onion rings. Only 4. It made us laugh.  The sliders were gross and the fries were so salty they couldn't be eaten. We got cookie sundaes for desert. The cookies were supposed to be chocolate chip but instead they were burnt black bricks. Not exaggerating... they were black. I can not believe that a restaurant would permit that to leave their kitchen. Only poor management would allow for such an all around bad experience. We ended up throwing most of our food away and making something at home. We will never go here again and unless you like wasting your money on terrible food and service,I'd recommend you stay away too."}
{"text":"SLOW!! waited almost 45 min for my to go order. I was told it would only take 10-15 min."}
{"text":"I started off with a tropical screwdriver the flavor was ok but the drink was watered down. I also tried the mimosa and that was pretty good. I ordered 3 sliders with fries, the beef, chicken and bbq pulled pork sliders. All of the buns were a little on the hard side and all sliders were really dry. The pulled pork didn't taste like it had any bbq sauce on it. I had to ask for extra ketchup for the other 2 sliders. The waitress was nice and friendly but when I asked for the check it took her 15 mins to come pick up the check."}
{"text":"Slow service mixed with the worst cheese possible on a pizza.  Boneless wings weren't bad but there wasn't silverware or blue cheese that was ordered.  Sticky tables blah blah blah.  You get it.  Go to Peter piper, same food and you can play skeeball."}
{"text":"Wings were ok, beer was cold and we loved the atmosphere! Could have been quicker, but heck I've had worst service!"}
{"text":"My family went to dinner there last night. The food is not as good as it used to be and it is smaller portions for more money. We have had bad and very slow service before but our waitress Lindsay was very nice and very promt. She had a very upbeat attitude and was on top of everything. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of native since they were by Safeway on Estrella. Always enjoyed Brett and the gang in the bar. Beers were cold and service was swift. My wife and I have visited the new location many times and have been increasingly disappointed in the service and food.  The last time was today on December 26th. Wings were cold and service was slow. The last 3 times we came we left the high tops and moved to the bar because no one came to get our drink order. But I feel this last time might be the last. My medium wings were cold and seemed raw.  We were seated by the kitchen and kept getting smells of what seemed to be sewer. Between the increasingly bad service, the cold wings and now the smell, I think this was our last visit."}
{"text":"The wings here are awesome! So many flavors to choose from, and each one is finger-lickin delicious! The prices are very reasonable, and the service is very good. In case if you're not into wings, they have other selections to choose from the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to take the family to this location tonight for some pizza and wings. Unfortunately, the food and the service was terrible. The salad was wilted and not fresh, the celery that came with the wings were limp and did not taste good, we continuously had to ask for refills, we had to explain why we wanted clean plates, we had to explain why we did not want to sit in the bar, the pizza was cold and stiff like it had been sitting for a while, and the waitress and hostess were a bit snippy. I was very disappointed in spending $60 for the service and food we have received. It was the first time in a long time we had decided to visit this restaurant and not sure when we will come back."}
{"text":"Your server Michelle is so awesome ..she is a great  asset to your team. I'm extremely  critical, ...and she passes with flying colors."}
{"text":"this is my original native.  it may be THE original native, but it's close to me so it's mine. anyway.  i love the relaxed vibe the constant stream of sport themed television, and of course the food and drink.  great flavors on the wings, i try them all.  .39 tues. and thurs. wings.  i like the strippers (boneless wings fyi) by the pound, or half pound.  you can get rowdy outside on the smokers patio.... or relax with the eclectic  vibe of the patrons inside.  sometimes parking can be @ a premium but you can always just park across the street and walk over.  all in all, native is a great place to hang out...drink a few adult beverages and dive into some tasty wings (or strippers) ...."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Love the appetizers.  The Friday fish fry is the best.  We always request Katelyn for our server.   She is so cheerful and friendly and we enjoy her.  Sara is also a nice hostess. She always comes up to us and asks how we are doing.   I highly recommend Native in the foothills."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find a place that you really want to love. A restaurant where you think you could be a regular. You try it several times, only to be disappointed time and time again. This place lacks management, lacks service, lacks quality control and lacks class. As we sit here tonight, I'm watching the beer promoter drink her own samples because no one is interested in yet another mediocre microbrew, while her partner is too stoned to notice he's in public as he does push-ups in between the bar tables, all while our appetizer, frozen to begin with, arrives to our table luke warm.   I'm sorry Native, I've wanted to like you, but you keep failing me."}
{"text":"Always went for the wings....not so much anymore too much breading and wings are just too big. Go back to the good old days of the 15 cent wing that had no breading and were crispy. Overall just too spendy for what you get."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but was disappointed. After living in the ahwatukee foothills area for over a year and driving all the way to Chandler to get takeout from Buffalo Wild Wings, we decided to try this place out and order takeout. We ordered wings and also the Native Combo Platter thinking it would be enough for our family of four to share. The wings were good and meaty. The platter  is where it all went down hill, especially considering it was $13.99 +tax. When we got home with our takeout, we opened it up to find 2 small chicken strips, 2 small potato skins-missing the scallions, 3 mozzarella sticks, a handful of zucchinis and onion rings. I was completely shocked, anywhere else the platter is worth the cost but this was worth 6-7 bucks at most! All of the food on the platter was  very bland and I'm not one of those \"super picky\" people either. This was the skimpiest platter I've ever ordered from any restaurant. Not one item in it was big or worth the cost it literally looked like they picked the smallest of everything since it was takeout.  The food amount was literally equivalent to the amount of food for a kids meal. I will take the 15 min drive to b-dubs in the future where I can get a variety platter and wings and get more food and better quality and flavor. I'm hoping that when you dine-in they give you the full amount of food that should be in a platter but if you are thinking about takeout I would think twice.  Not sure if we will give this place another chance or not. :("}
{"text":"Not impressed. The waitress couldn't be bothered with greeting us or checking on us....and it was slower than molasses. Didn't make us feel welcome whatsoever, and spent more time chatting with 2 gentlemen, than attending us or any other patrons. Ehhh, guess I'll just stick to take out (which I'm not impressed w/ either btw, waited on hold for over 15 minutes once to order) The food is not bad though, I mean I've come back twice."}
{"text":"My family and I go there all the time! Great ambiance, great food, and great customer service! The wait staff is very friendly and having been there so many times have gotten to know the owners. Theu are very nice people. My standard is the Stripper Platter with Honey Hot Sauce. My only complaint is that there are no carrots served with the wings. It is a convenient location, freat food and a wonderful experience. Highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Always great wings. I went to watch UFC with some friends. Staff is friendly drinks a plenty. good staff @ this loc.  no complaints.  my compliments"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken bacon ranch flatbread, bacon cheeseburger w/fries, and 10 boneless wings. It took about 30 minutes to get our food. When we did, the boneless wings were luke warm, extremely dry and chewy. I would have gotten another coke if our waiter wasn't chit chatting with his friends at another table. He did offer to take the wings to the back and warm them up. Really? My burger was warm and dry with a semi hard bun. My wife said her flatbread was good. So there's that. This was our first and last time going here."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza and wings I have ever had! Ok, listen, I know Iarrived about 5 min before they closed their kitchen but I called about 15 min earlier and phoned my order for pickup. This still doesn't excuse them for selling crap. The pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust. I know NY pizza is kinda supposed to be thin but \"common man\"! Even the ingredients were terrible. Low quality bread cheese n pepperoni. I really honestly feel that a Tony's frozen pizza from the super market would have been better. The wings were overcooked, sauceless and very very salty. The only reason I did not take this stuff back is because they were about 4 miles away and my brother n I were very hungry. I come from Los Angeles and I have only been in AZ for a little over 1 month but so far my experience with pizza hasn't been great. This place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do. I never even write reviews good or bad but they got me to actually write one. I would have rated negative stars if I could... SMFH!! I will neva, eva, evaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva.... come here again! Go to Oregano's instead. It's like night and day even though you have to wait forever, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"The service was good from the server after she finally warmed up to us but the management is horrible. He was prejudice against us vs another table because of age and sports fans. Other table was an older couple upset be we wanted the sound on and were being loud when watching football in a sports bar on Sunday. Ludicrous he was never polite and nothing but irritated w us. I am someone who works in the industry and understands all needs of the patron but to be treated w such disrespect by the manager of a chain restaurant and bar is incredibly poor service."}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  My husband and I have been here a few times and have had good service and good food.  I don't think it's anything special, just another wing place, but my husband loves it!"}
{"text":"This place is rediculous. 20 mins and no service. I counted 9 people behind the bar talking. The place had less then half the tables full I walked over and got my own drinks. Then after 10 more minutes I had to go get menus from the front then after 5 mins a waitress came buy and said oh you ordered from the bar ( we had water) so I asked can we still order? She said yes. Then said we need Id to sit in the bar area. I said we have water. And I'm 42 and my wife is 39.  The last thing I want when I'm already getting mad is being harassed.  I asked for the manager and told him the story and then we left and went to red robin. Way better but they need better tv's. ( we were watching the nba game.). I would avoid NNY  it's always been poor service but this was the last time as a consumer I'll take it.   Mike  6/8/12 UPDATE : The GM Karri made contact with me and she was very nice. She asked for my side of what happened and wanted to get as much info as possible to better her restaurant. She was respectfull and listened to my complaint. She said she would hate to loose a customer and asked for another chance.  I appreciate her for trying to make it right. Solely because she made this contact I will give NNY another try.  Thank you again Karri."}
{"text":"Looks amazing since they remodeled. Food is great! Pizza, wings and potatoes skins are my fav! And they have 49 cent wings on Tuesdays! But Tuesdays are usually super crowded, but it's not too bad. It's s positive environment and they usually have a game playing on several TV's throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"I live right in the neighborhood and was happy when they opened but, after a few visits, their food and service is more bad than good. So today, hubby wanted some wings so I called to place an order so I can pick it up on my way home from work. The woman answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup then the line went dead.  I called again, the woman answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup and the line went dead again.  This happened 2 more times. 4 in total. I called again (glutton for punishment) and a male answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup, he said ok then I asked him if they were having a problem with their phone line because I was hung up on 4 times.  The guy said no no problem with the phone line then I said well I may have been hung up on.  He said well lets just move on what is your order.  At this point I no longer wanted to do business with them and I decided not to order."}
{"text":"My son and I were in Phoenix for a couple of days to watch the Yotes and Oilers. We were staying in the area and went into this place on a Sunday evening. What a huge mistake. The waitress was just fine, however, the food was miserable. My son ordered a burger and I ordered a chicken sandwich. My sandwich was burnt on the edges and the curly fries were soggy (for both of us). My son's burger was barely edible and I wish I could say the same for the chicken burger.  It tasted aweful. That was my last meal in this joint."}
{"text":"Disgusting. In trouble for not ID'ing people, so you make my boyfriend and I fill out our own identification because your employee was too lazy to ask for our ID and fill it out. She's lucky we were actually over 21! (Only 25) You just got in trouble for this?! Now tonight you allowed a group that was way too drunk to come in. They were seated behind us in a booth. A woman in the group grabbed my back and laughed while I was sitting having my dinner and then puked right next to her booth on the ground. It was clear the whole group was drunk and maybe even more than that, yet not one employee did anything. We had to please ask an employee to clean it up as it was inches from my foot. The group laughed while the woman puked and joked about her licking it up, it was clear she wasn't just sick. We decided to move to the bar so I could at least finish my drink. I ate about 5 bites out of my food but couldn't eat anymore after seeing and experiencing all of that. Our waitress didn't apologize, didn't offer any sort of discount, but worst of all made us feel like we inconvenienced her for moving to the bar. DO BETTER. You guys are going to go down hill if you keep this up. My boyfriend and I used to come here weekly about a year ago, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been looking for wing alternatives to Buffalo Wild Wings, this place hit the spot! The Wings are not your traditional buffalo wings. They are breaded and flavorful. I recommend trying if you want breaded wings."}
{"text":"Before I start, let me make it clear that this review applies to the Surprise location only.  According to my nephew, other locations he has been to are much better.  That being said...  My nephew was excited to share Native New Yorker with us on our visit to Arizona the weekend of April 11-14.  On Friday night the 11th, we came in to a moderately busy crowd.  We were seated in fairly short order, but ran in to our first snag when they initially refused to make a lower-cost swap on a special they were running.  I didn't care whether I was credited for the difference but my better half didn't like one of the options and wanted something LESS expensive.  I wouldn't even have minded an up-charge for the swap if needed but their flat refusal grated on me.  They did eventually decide that I could do it \"just this once\", but even that attitude didn't exactly encourage me to return.  It was very grudging.  However, one thing happened that would prevent me from ever even giving this location a second chance.  My nephew ordered a salad with chicken strips, and one of the strips was practially RAW.  I kid you not.  In 32 years of adulthood, I have never seen that.  They did take it back and tried to correct it, but even the correction was underdone.  To be fair, it was removed from the bill; however, the risk of food poisoning is not worth the $13 of that particular salad.  Apparently the manager of this location had just been replaced; I don't know if things have improved in the last two weeks."}
{"text":"Let me say I'm giving 3 stars because the Cobb Salad was pretty good.  I would comeback for the salad.  However the service was so slow and inattentive that I will not be back.  It was not busy and there appeared to be plenary of help.  Waitress would just disappear. Wonder how much slower on a busy night. Never got my drink refilled. Another drink at the table was refilled wrong. Make sure you check in on Yelp and get your free tater tots. Plenary of TVs but sound was too low."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'll start from the beginning. We get there, we walk in, waited 5 minutes to be seated when they weren't busy at all. The hostess greets us and we can hardly understand what she's saying (possibly under the influence). Once we are seated, we wait another 15 minutes before our server comes by to take our drink order. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. Another 15 minutes goes by and we have to flag another server down to get our drinks. We get our drinks then 5 minutes later our appetizer. Then our food comes 2 minutes after being served the appetizer and our foods cold. We try to speak with a manager and wait 20 minutes, nobody comes to our table. So we pay the bill and leave. Normally I'm a generous tipper however, this was horrible service and they weren't even busy!!!"}
{"text":"We come here occasionally as we shop in the area. This will be our last trip here. The service was bad. It took too long to get seated considering the fact they weren't busy. The buns on the sliders were burnt. The sliders were dry and over cooked. The chicken on my Caesar salad was dry and bland. There were 3x as many croutons on the Caesar salad as needed. There was barely any Caesar dressing on the lettuce. The chicken strips were over cooked, dry, and barely got dusted with dry rub. Oh, and it took the waitress forever to notice our empty drink glasses!  Don't waste your $$ here. Other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Awful wings,  filthy tables. Good luck getting drink refills... and on a Monday night,  hate to be here on a busy night"}
{"text":"My brother and I went here to attend a going away get together for one of our coworkers. We sat at the table for ten minutes before any of the waiters recognized us and when he did show up, he ignored  us and claimed to have not seen us even though he stared straight at my brother and I.   After all that was figured out we each ordered a glass of ice water and a 2 orders of wings. 1/2 pound BBQ boneless and 1/2 pound hot boneless.   What did I end up paying for 2 waters, 5 tasteless hot wings, and 6 cold BBQ wings? I paid almost $30.   When I asked why is was so high the waiter simply said to pay it and he'd explain afterword. He also gave HIMSELF a rather generous tip on top of the already ridiculous bill.  I will not be going here again and neither will any of my family members."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and they were really terrible. Just a soggy mess... I had ordered to-go online and arrived at my selected time. I was told to wait another 15 minutes because the wings were just being tossed. Actually at that point I was really glad because I thought the wings will be prepared fresh. Nope. The wings were lukewarm and soggy as of it had been sitting out for quite a while. I won't be returning for the wings anyway."}
{"text":"I love the lemon pepper wings and the garbage pizza. The bar area is nice to sit at, decent service and lots of TVs to watch your favorite sports. I stay away from the restaurant side though... every time I've sat there with my family I leave thinking, \"Why do I keep coming here?\" Mostly service oriented issues.  So stick to the bar if you go! Between the cold beer and assortment of TVs you'll forget you even came with someone!"}
{"text":"I went to Native New Yorker to pick up a pizza to go.  After the girl at the cash register helped three people who came in after me...I finally ordered and had a seat to wait.  During my wait I learned a lot.  I learned that the hostess station is where all the waitstaff get together to openly badmouth the customers that are currently eating.  I learned that the waitstaff also uses the hostess station to play grab ass.  I also learned that it was a lovely girls first night working at NNY.  She came in and advised the hostess of this and was greeted by the hostess with an enthusiastic and high pitched welcome.  After the new girl walked away to start her new job the hostess rolled her eyes, scoffed and poured out a slew of hateful, mean, hostile and curse ridden comments about the new girls appearance.  At this point my pizza was ready and I was more then ready to leave.  NNY is getting 2 stars because the pizza was subpar compared to the other slop that locals try to pass off as pizza here in AZ."}
{"text":"I went there last night to watch the game , I ordered the chicken wings ( Asiago & Honey bbq ) my girl ordered the salad chicken wraps & the food was Good but the waitress was kinda slow & it wasn't that busy.. Overall  I give it a 3 out of 5 stars..  The outside patio is a Plus...  If your smoker u can enjoy the game with a beer & cigar or whatever u smoke... There's water Mister's outside so it's cool outside..."}
{"text":"Service was good. Ordered call chicken sandwich .when I got the sandwich they forgot the avacado"}
{"text":"Would love to review the food but never got any. Stood at the front didn't see one employee for the ten minutes I stood waiting.  So much for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We used to go here quite a bit and enjoyed the quality of the food and portions.  The price has gone up quite a bit and portions and quality has gone down.  If your looking for good food at a good price, this isn't it..."}
{"text":"Wings and pizza are really good but i always have to wait along time for my food when i get take out. Called at 7:09pm they said my food would be ready in 15 to 20 min. Last time they gave me a time of 10-15 min and it took 45min all together. So i decided not to rush this time. I arrive at about 8:15pm and it was 8:27 when they brought the wings out. So 1hr and 18min after placing a order it was ready thats unsat"}
{"text":"Alexis is really friendly and wonderful! She makes a great bloody mary, regular and spicy. Thanks"}
{"text":"This was my families first time here. Me, my husband and my 11 month old son have been looking for a family friendly, but adult oriented place nearby the house. The food was good. We got the hangover burger and wings. The burger was particularly good with a fried egg and avocado on it. To be honest, like previous reviews, the wings were overdone, but better over than undercooked. However the best part of the meal was definitely our server Derek. Derek did all the normal wonderful server things like check on us constantly, make sure we had everything we needed, gave us refills, but more than that he made us feel like he truly cared about our experience. We walked here, and to have a place so close by that we can rely on for good food and excellent service is wonderful.   We will definitely be back. The manager Andrew went over some of the plans for the future and we are really excited to have an official neighborhood hang out.   Truly a wonderful experience all around. And sorry for the mess! Our 11 month old made sure mac n cheese was everywhere."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to put a Zero Star review of this place. I just finished balancing my Visa statement and noticed that the waitress took it upon herself to add 8.00 to a 14.07 bill. Thankfully Chase was willing to give me a courtesy credit for this overcharge. But I can tell you this...I will not be going back to this establishment. This was actually just the icing on the cake, as I thought the place was way over priced, loud, and served mediocre food. So thank you \"Joy\" for overcharging me, and cementing the fact that I won't be back!"}
{"text":"We got the hostess look at us funny like she didn't know was going on. So we sat at bar side.  So we sat there for twenty minutes til they took our order, we had three different say hello and said our server will get us soon.It seem like they didn't know where to go or what to do.We didn't know it was wings night. We ask our server if we can get 1/2 legs and 1/2 wings. His answer was the cooks are too busy so they will give us what they wanted.  But he will try and he was right the cook gave us what they wanted. What happen to customers service?"}
{"text":"Really?  Since they put in very little effort to make decent food or run a clean establishment, I will make very little effort reviewing them:  Pure scheisse."}
{"text":"I wandered over here a couple of nights while I was staying at the hotel next door. The first night was spent downing a few pitchers with friends and the second night was spent at the bar grabbing a small bite to eat, so I'll break it down that way.  (Friday Evening): Native New Yorker is a solid location to drink. A fun atmosphere coupled with reasonable prices made sure that we all had to hold one-another up on the way back to the hotel for the night. We had an extremely friendly and attentive server and I'd highly recommend you go here to make good-times with friends.   (Sunday evening, second visit): As for the food experience, while good, I'd give it a 3 stars overall. The night we sat at the bar and ordered food, the bartender was not pleasant to say the least. Fortunately the food was decent and came out pretty quickly, so we didn't have to deal with her much and the positives outweighed the negatives."}
{"text":"It's day #2 of my visit in lovely Buckeye, Arizona.    My friends again suggest going to a sports bar for dinner.   \"A sports bar again?  Why?\"   Well folks... it turns out... according to my friends anyway, there are few restaurants in Buckeye with \"good food\" and apparently sports bars are the exception.   Who knew? Sign outside http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#XyKJowL076lY_5x-oKQBkg  They have a couple special parking spots. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#_hW-Nt4yudosJt5TI-gX0A  In normal sports bar fashion, there are lots of TV's spread around the bar and dining room area for your viewing pleasure. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#aaPFjH6QBUS_WMYo2rR25g  SERVICE:   A very friendly host/greeter showed us to our table.    Our server Luis was pretty friendly and was less (rather than more) attentive, coming by once after the food was delivered to the table.   I had to ask another server to get Luis a couple of times.    The Manager Jerrod was very nice and did a great job of taking care of his customers, but we'll get back to him in a minute.  FOOD:  I decided to order the Chicken Alfredo ($10.99) which included a salad.   The salad was VERY simple as salads go, romaine & iceburg lettuce, diced tomato and shredded jack cheese, period.   I suppose people don't come here for their \"quality\" salads.    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#QhrifrAzTV9cbNUyB0TnKQ  When our dishes arrived from the kitchen, the guy made sure we knew the plates were \"hot\"!    Chicken was nice and warm, perfectly cooked and super delish.... unfortunately the pasta and sauce under the chicken was barely... and I mean barely luke warm.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#TLmgjKXq3VXOvMSa4l3-5Q  I asked to speak to the manager and soon Jerrod came to our table.   Now I want to make special note here that I am NOT one of those difficult, pain-in-the-ass customers that's never happy with anything.   Nope, not that at all.   I did however want to bring this issue to the managers attention because if I didn't, he wouldn't know there was a problem and he wouldn't be able to correct it.     I explained all this to him and let him know the pasta was nearly cold when it arrived.   He was very understanding, apologetic and appreciative that I took the time to let him know.   He went to the kitchen and had another one made on the spot.... when it came out not only was the plate hot, but this time the pasta was too!   Jerrod came by the table later to make sure everyone was happy and gave us each a $5 off coupon for our next visit.   A nice touch!  My friends ordered the Hawaiian Calzone($8.99).....  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#Mlwx2mo4spyu3UtEbQSaCg ...and the Chicken Parmesan ($10.99) with a cup of their Philly Cheesesteak soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#a80RsSRUF_qCxhaZAYhgIw They were both happy with their choices, however I found out later the pasta & sauce in the chicken parm was also barely luke warm... but my friend didn't want to \"make a scene\".  I was able to taste the Philly Cheesesteak soup - it was very creamy, very cheesy, with an essence of onions and peppers, but no real beef flavor and only had a couple very small pieces of beef in it.   It was really very good as soups go, but I'm reminded of that Wendy's hamburger commercial where the old lady (Clara Peller) keeps saying \"Where's the beef?\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/native-grill-and-wings-buckeye-buckeye#_i1noX000oJLatBjPQPDig  OVERALL: Another sports bar and another dinner.   I got a luke warm entree, but the manager stepped up and was really grateful I let him know about it.  Because of this I'm going 4 stars rather than 3."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a handful of times now, so it's time for a review. The service is rather hit and miss, depending on the day and your server. The food is usually good, but I've yet to have anything that made a really strong impression on me as being exceptional.  This restaurant has wings in its name, so you would expect that to be a specialty. Well, they do have a good variety of wing flavors and again, they are generally pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. And the price of the wings are not cheap, unless you are there during happy hour or on Tuesdays, when they have a promotional price on them. Otherwise, personally I think paying over a dollar per wing is a little high for the product.  So, back to the service topic. I mentioned it was hit and miss. Well on this visit it was a huge miss. My wife and I decided to sit on the patio since the weather was so nice. We reported inside first to let the staff know we would be sitting on the patio and the waitress said she would send someone out for us. So, on the way back out to the patio, I observed a waiter carrying a very large tray full of food and since he was right behind me and headed to the patio, I held the door for him to assist him. He thanked me and followed me out to the patio. My wife and I ended up sitting just 2 tables past the large party that he was serving, so we assumed he would come greet us after he got the food delivered to the other table.  Nope, no such luck. In fact we sat there for 10 minutes and saw him come back out 2 more times to bring drink refills and also turn on the ceiling fans out there. When it became obvious that we were waiting for service that wasn't going to happen, I went back inside and approached the waiter to confirm that he was in fact responsible for the patio, which he did confirm. I then shared my displeasure with him very firmly and reminded him that I had even held the door for him to assist and that ignoring my wife and me was rude and unacceptable. He apologized and said he would be right out. After about a minute he did come out, apologized to both of us and was obviously sincere with his sentiment. From that point forward, his service was fine, and be did discount the check as a measure of compensation.  So all in all, the end result was ok. It's just not the way that anyone wants their dinner visit to start, and it's frustrating to have to chase someone down to avoid being completely ignored.  In summary, from my perspective, this establishment is a good place to watch sports, with their many TV's and sports programs. It's also a good place for some decent happy hour specials. The food is acceptable, especially if you're just wanting some \"bar food\" to put in your tummy while having a beer or beverage. As long as you are not in any hurry, just want to hunker down for a while, and have no expectations of prompt service or above average food, then you will be more than happy here. If your expectations are for exceptional food and/or service, then you might want to reconsider selecting this venue for your dining experience."}
{"text":"I went in expecting to get good service since this was basically the only sports bar in Buckeye. The service was terrible, our waitress never stopped by at our table for refills, when we finally got our food we decided to just take it to go. I figure eating at home was better than staying at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've lived in laveen since 2001, before 51st ave became a large street, and when you had to drive to get groceries anywhere.  I've had great service in the bar at native, but sitting in the other area is just plain dumb if you're over 21. Tonight we had crap service, the only reason they recieved 3 stars is because of previous experiance.   I reall don't understand how you can leave a table sitting for 15 minutes with empty glasses, while you disappeared into the kitchen. never once coming by our table to ask how our food is, this service is one of the worst i've ever had.  with that said i love honey hot wings, i'd probably bath in the sauce if it was possable."}
{"text":"Just wanted to compliment Nick on the incredible customer service we received tonight. Our to go order wasn't quite what we'd asked for and he realized it before the food was even boxed up. He apologized in a friendly manner, assured it would be corrected, and did so quickly and kindly. On top of that, the pizza we ordered was super-delicious. Being Friday night the restaurant was busy and there were plenty of customers to keep happy. It was refreshing to have attention paid to the quality of our order and our satisfaction. We'll be returning again soon. Thanks so much, Nick!"}
{"text":"The service was good.   I had a Cobb Salad. Overall, it was a good salad and the bleu cheese dressing was very good, but the bacon on the salad was completely RAW.   Sorry, I find that to be unacceptable. I removed the bacon and ate the rest of the salad.   I say: consumer beware."}
{"text":"Your typical native new yorker, a nicer location than most because it used to be a local restaurant.  Typical sports grill fare, good amount of wing flavors."}
{"text":"Has really degraded in to a very rough spot with poor food and service."}
{"text":"Started off with a hair in our water.  Ended by seeing a cock roach crawling on the floor.  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in to grab some lunch. Used the bathroom and no hand soap. Took 10 mins for hand soap to get replaced. Ordered a pitcher of beer and wings. Cost was good at 49 cents each for lunch. I ordered naked wings with no breading. They said it would take longer. Dont know why. Wings were good. Not as good as bww imo. Service was average. Bar area smelt like its was cleaned with a semi dirty mop. A lot of tvs, good for sports."}
{"text":"im updating my review of native because the owner was nice enough to invite me back for a second chance.  Gotta say...  I was very happy!  Wings were good beer was cold and the server was all over it.  Great job guys, Im coming back."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times. Service is good. Sometimes the waiting period for the food is a little long, other times fast. Food is good. Staff is friendly. Over all it's good."}
{"text":"It's the perfect go-to for a local neighborhood restaurant. If you're watching calories - be REALLY careful about what and how you order. But the food is always good, and the service is great. I used to go here with my family a lot. They would rarely mess up our orders, but on the off chance anything went wrong they were always polite, apologetic, and quick and prompt about fixing the problem. Nice place."}
{"text":"I work nearby and we get lunch from there about 1x a month.  We always call our orders in first. We arrive at the time specified and it's never ready.  Then all 3 of the most recent visits the orders have been wrong or they forgot items we ordered. Today they forgot a salad and the buffalo potato chips were made with tortilla chips...eww. My co workers got chicken strippers and there are 3 very small pieces of chicken. The other 2 times they forgot salads, dressings, etc.  For as pricey as it is, that's ridiculous. The last time they screwed up an order we called and the guy laughed and said I guess you can come back and pick it up. So needless to say, we aren't going to call and complain this time, we just aren't going to come back.  The food is usually pretty good (with the exception of today's chicklets-not worthy of being called chicken strips) but customer service and carry out is horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place better than the one in Avondale! Food totally worth what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I love the renovations they did! It looks great. And I've been lucky enough to have Alyssa as my server several times and she is always five star! Talk about service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Man.. this place used to be so good. Not just this location, but any Native New Yorker. It is a fact that when a restaurant starts adding pictures to the menu, it's downhill..  Service was mediocre. But that's not even the reason I was prompted to write this review.  I usually stick with beer, but this time I decided to go for the Blackberry Mojito. I should have known something was amiss when I asked the server if they muddled the mint or not and she looked at me like a deer in headlights.  It got worse.  She came back and dropped it off at the table and immediately I knew something was off.. A taste... and then another... and then, \"what in the *** is that?\"  BASIL?!?!?!?!  Yeah... turns out, the bartender was out of mint and decided I wouldn't notice if he used basil instead.  Fool me once..."}
{"text":"I never cared for chicken wings until my husband took me here when we were dating. We ove coming for the Tuesday special on wings. That's all we go there for nowadays. So many flavors to try from. What makes them the best is that although they may seem smaller than that of Buffalo Wild Wings they have less fat and inedible parts on them and are just good meat and flavor, usually not to dry or to sloping wet. It is so nice to see the manager come by our table each visit and greet us and check to see if we are doing alright. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. The food is good and the beer prices make my husband happy. We like to share the two for $20 meal deal!"}
{"text":"Absoluetely loved the wings today.  We were told by our server, Danielle, that chef Bruce is the best!  We thoroughly enjoyed every bite and even ordered some to take home. Our server, Danielle, was awesome.  She was so sincere and she truly made our dining experience even better!   We will return for those fantastic wings but also to share some time with Danielle..she has a blessed spirit!"}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite restaurant. Worst service I got in a long time. Will be going to a different native. Drug test your employees! We didn't come here to listen to them talk about drugs. So nasty that I got service from a drug addict."}
{"text":"It wasn't horrible.      However, it wasn't good.  We walked in and the whole layout of the place was quite awkward; it felt like the dining room was in some hallway.  The service was ok, not good, but not entirely crappy either.  It was pretty scattered, but good enough.  The menu is like Old Chicago, but with 80% less flavor.  The HH beer prices were the only saving grace of the place..$3 for a 22 oz (sadly, domestic-but whaddaya gonna do, times are tight)  Now, I have a bit of a cold, so things are a little hard to taste right now.  I ordered the club on a croissant with curly fries (I am a curly fry freak), there was no flavor to either.  I figured it was just the cold speaking, my boyfriend noticed that I barely ate either one, and took a couple bites of mine; unfortunately, let me know that it was not the cold, but the fact that the food truly had no taste to it, that was the issue.   Oh well.  Yelp told me so, and if the choice of where to eat had been ours, we wouldn't have gone in.  But here it is, another crappy Yelp review page confirmed... NNY-you kinda suck.  $27 and the only thing I tasted was the Miller Lite.... and Domestics have no flavor to begin with..Oh My!"}
{"text":"We ate at Native last Tuesday because of their wing special. We walked out without having to pay for the bill. My wife and kids meals where over cooked and that made the chicken like rubber. My chicken still had feathers attached. Sick!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. It had been awhile since my wife and I had been here. It was clean and bright.  Going for the cookie and ice cream."}
{"text":"This is not the \"Native New Yorker\" I've loved for over 20 years. The NNY had signature wings that people couldn't get enough of. They used to be 10 cents a piece back in the 90's. Sad that they were replaced by this stuff. I don't go there anymore. It's all in the sauce (also crispy and not much fat). The NNY had it down. Man were they good! I've been trying to replace them ever since."}
{"text":"My friend was treated very badly tonight by a manager, Luis. He was accusing her without any reason other than she was brown & female! He had no idea if she was someone that took food without paying. He handled himself badly! I won't go back & will tell all my friends to spend their money elsewhere.  It made me give them one star..they don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Draft beer flat and had bad after taste, food cold and not appetizing, service not good and place was empty (was there mid day Monday).   We also had trouble getting silverware. This place needs Bar Rescue (Jon Taffer) bad!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"hey guys..... :( so heres the dealm i never Belive review untill i vist it once. this is honestly the worst. worst. worst if your reading this read everything and believe it. severs takes forever food sucks. A two hour vist can just turn into 3 hours of waiting. will never return"}
{"text":"Tried it like four or five times. Their customer service is horrible. The food takes forever to come out. You wait forever for the bill. I love native new yorker just not this one"}
{"text":"Love the different flavors of wings. Pizza is good too. Wish there was one surprise closer to home"}
{"text":"I went in, waited for a host for about five minutes, looked around and a waitress saw me, did nothing. I waited another five minutes and still no one came to seat me. I was very irritated because they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"I had apps: meatball, wing trio and hummus plate, all excellent! Went in a quiet Sunday  watched sports.  Hubby got burger; wasn't cooked med rare but well done, otherwise good. Service is very relaxed."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern.  Could you please bring back Adrianna to Friday nights. We came a few Fridays ago and We had a whole new experience without her and it wasn't good. We were going to the bar to order cause or waitress that night was taking to long to check on us and when she did get our drink orders it took 15+ minutes to get them. This never happened when Adrianna waited on us.  She was always on top of her game."}
{"text":"The best wings in Arizona, is what I would've said if I'd written this review 15 or more years ago. When I was going to ASU this was absolutely the best place I started eating there $.10 wings in high school, and almost can't go to a home game without having them first. They used to be $.10 apiece and they've gone way way way up since then, to the point the price is no different than everyone else. The quality has gone down too. Eating at native is OK, and it's called native now not native New Yorker for some stupid reason, but it's nothing special anymore. The changes were definitely not an improvement unfortunately."}
{"text":"A better Buffalo Wild Wings is how it was sold to me years ago. It rang true then and remains true today. Better wings, better service, less cluttered and chaotic atmosphere. I was here to watch the Stanley Cup finals and I could watch the game with my family and some solid grub."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food and we had a toddler with us. Everyone around us that arrived after we did was served before we were. Our server was nowhere to be found and after an hour when we finally did catch her ever so briefly she said she would check on our order and then took another long while before coming to apologize for the delay and blamed it on the fact there was some game on and they'd just been slammed. When I told her that everyone else was being served she just vanished with no explanation. The manager (I'm assuming?) came out and said it wouldn't be much longer, they got slammed because of a game that everyone had come to watch, and again when I pointed out that everyone around us who arrived after we did was already eating he just quickly disappeared. I then told our server that we would cancel our order and just pay for the drinks we had consumed and miraculously our food then appeared before she could bring the bill. It was freshly cooked and hot. Clearly our order was missed. But instead of owning up to it they blamed it on some game. No discount offered and no real apologies. I get that people make mistakes and orders get missed. Just own your mistake!  Very unimpressed. Will not return."}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately seated. Our waitress was great and friendly and very professional. She went to grab us our drinks and as we're looking at the menu we look around and notice most of the employees are teenagers which is fine but most of them sitting around talking to each other and on their phones. The two hostesses were sitting at the front on their phones. The other employees were just standing around. So we got our drinks and placed our order and we got wings and asked for carrots in place of celery and they charged us extra for the carrots and they were baby carrots and we only got about 4 of them.. ok so whatever the server is nice and the wings are good so you know I didn't mind that much until I saw two guys who came from the venue right by the restaurant come in and they came in and started talking to the employees and then they went into the kitchen while wearing their tuxedos and drinking their Starbucks drinks... that's very weird to have strangers go into the kitchen. But the wings were ok and our server was pleasant, but I won't be returning back"}
{"text":"The hubbie and son are wingholics and this is their favorite place for wings.    I will say the New Yorker wings are definitely better than San Tan Brewing Co in Chandler, but I prefer Zipps sweet/hot over New Yorker.  The rest of the New Yorker food offerings are okay, nothing to get excited about.  The Ahwatukee location lost the hubbie and son's business several years ago when their wings were priced differently (higher) than what was on the menu.  The mgr was not willing to honor the menu price, stating wing prices had recently risen and not all the menus were marked or changed, so my hubbie exercised his right to find another New Yorker location.  Since then, Mesa is it since the Chandler/Sun Lakes location has slloooowww service."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker knows their wings!  I would only come here for the wings, and the wings are why I come here.  That, and it's a decent place to sit and hang out with some friends, and maybe watch a game (or 7).  The best part about the wings are all the flavor options.  You don't have to get full orders of one flavor, so I tend to mix and match.  I love the pineapple teriyaki and honey bbq, and the asian garlic ones are pretty good added in for interest.  I'm sure the spicy varieties are great, but unfortunately, I am a wimp.  The celery sticks are even good, none of that not-yet-ripe, inch-long, only-2-pieces business.  I haven't tried any of the other food... I haven't felt the need to do so yet.    There's a patio if the weather permits.  It has its own bar and some TVs, so it's nice if you're there for the sports.  Inside, there are more than enough TVs to scream at.  I shouldn't have written this review so early, I'm going to be daydreaming about chicken wings all day!"}
{"text":"Have been here for happy hour plenty of times after work. But have never really dined here.... Waitress wasn't bad at all. But she did wrote god bless on my ticket and I'm not one to knock someone's religion but that wasn't really my kind of taste.. I just have different beliefs than others and not that she knew that but she shouldn't have wrote it. Idk haha. Also I have never been to a place where ranch was such a top priority. We asked for ranch. She informed us it was this much for this or a dollar for this much. I chose the dollar... Our app came out and I was like oh we had ordered ranch . and then they kept checking on the ranch making sure we got it and that it was delivered. And then another one came out and they freaked. And said they weren't charging for it. I didn't care but they were just a lil hostile on the ranch lol...."}
{"text":"First time and most certainly last time I will visit this Native. The hostess was rude. The waitress didn't write our order down had to come ask a second time what we ordered. Then forgot an item we ordered. Our food came out within 10 min we thought oh good but nope wings were cold to barley warm like they have been sitting in a warmer waiting for people to order them then just throw hot sauce on them. Then brought out food she forgot to put in and it was also cold! I do not recommend going to this native."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker was once one of our favorite haunts, we still speak fondly of the days when we could go and order wings, a pitcher of Bass Ale and cheese and crackers and still not spend $12. Well today's experience sure drove home how those days are long gone.  When I walked in the hostess asked me where I would like to sit, in the bar or the restaurant. I asked for the restaurant side and then she told me I could not sit there would it be alright if I sat in the bar? No I say, I'll go someplace else. Suddenly the floor manager appears and says that I can sit where I like. Ok then.  I was waiting for others to join me so I ordered a glass of iced tea and sat back to await my friends. I decided to partake of an appetizer, mozzarella sticks, basic, easy, cheap.  Well the cheese was hot at least, but there was no, and I do mean no flavour at all.  Most cheese sticks are seasoned in some fashion, not these. Batter, cheese, served with an indifferent bottled italianish red sauce. I was shocked, but I figured whatever, it's only cheap cheese sticks.  The refills of my tea were getting progressively weaker until my last refill was vaguely tanish water with no flavour at all. What the heck?  Well after waiting some time my phone rang to tell me my friends were not coming, (Thank goodness), so I asked for my bill. No I had ordered the least expensive appetizer on any menu and the one drink other than water with the lowest overhead cost. My bill was $11.56! For iced tea and cheese!  Compounding my reaction to this bill was the condition of a nearly empty restaurant and the level of service provided by the staff. The restaurant was badly in need of sweeping, many tables required service and the men's room was well, unacceptable. Also, in a restaurant that had so few customers I should never see servers leaning on counters and chatting instead of cleaning and providing customer service, and I should never, EVER see staff on their cell phones instead of working.   There are many Native Grills around the East Valley, may I humbly recommend the store at Greenfield and Baseline. This particular restaurant on Gilbert Rd and Germann is not worth your trouble."}
{"text":"If you get really excited while watching football then I suggest not coming here to watch your favorite team. I came here one Sunday afternoon for some wings, a beer, and my favorite team and ended up getting in trouble for throwing an \"fbomb\". LAME. I was throwing obscenities within my own table.. but my bad, that's not allowed at a \"family place\". Note to parents: if you're bringing your child to a sports bar on a Sunday filled with grown men and alcohol, expect the worst. I went to a NNY in Anthem and loved it. People yell and scream (yeah even bad words =X) and no one gets in trouble. That's the way sports are meant to be watched!   BTW, I know 2 people who got food poisoning from their greasy wings. Enough said."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took 45 minutes for a few burgers when they are this busy? Friendly greeting and prompt attention & double checked the order with me before we left. Food is good - took home to watch movie with the family  only thing disappointing was extra charge for ranch - with a big appetizer sampler and 4 burgers would have thought ranch would have come with. Not a deal breaker but for the price may have to try other area offerings"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star I would but there service is terrible I order food for myself and my husband over the phone and they quoted me 10 minutes I gave them 15 minutes before I even got there and then they made me wait another 20 minutes for my food I'm seriously disappointed and when I told the host I was unhappy he told me I shouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Very long wait to times for mediocre food. I know the server was busy, but it took 20 min after we got our beer to order food. I had to flag her down. The mandarin wings were basically deep fried, over cooked, then drenched in sauce. The lime rub wings were bland. Wings out of store bought box are much better. Beer was good , but how can you mess that up. Native NY used to be 'the bomb' -now this place simply bombs."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waitress was very rude and had a bad attitude. She seemed irritated that me and my friend took so long to order but my friend has never been here so she didn't know what to get. I also asked for a soda and she brought me a water instead. Not coming here anymore every time I come it seems to be the same service."}
{"text":"Waitress was great, cooks are awful. Wings had barely any meat and were mostly batter. Screwed up my gf's order too and didn't offer anything for it. Manager seemed like  D-bag as well."}
{"text":"Thumbs down on the wings  the chicken Cesar salad was cool and my buddy chicken flat was better than the wings"}
{"text":"Ate at the Chandler location tonight, even though we were not happy with he wings last time. The wings were so tiny, dry and chewy again. (I see that a lot of the posts on Yelp and other places comment on how the wings seem to get smaller and smaller by the year). Complained to the waiter and he brought out 3 bigger drummies that were good. Why aren't they serving these in the first place? I have been going to Native NY for 30 yrs. This place used to be awesome. Tonight was my last trip unless things change."}
{"text":"We really like the when it was Native New yorker and was on Bell/Freeway.  Service here was AWEFUL. We saw our waiter when we first came trying to rush our order. We said we werent' ready. we had questions on the menu when he dropped off our drinks(basic soda water etc..) he answered them but then disappeared for a good 10 minutes before he came back. Then the manager who seemed to be more of a waiter making sure all was ok delivered our food.No waiter for another 15 minutes(asked for napkins that never came.) He seemed not to care about who he was taking care of.  Won't be going back to this  location. If you want a great location go to the one by the Cardinal/Coyotes stadiums. they have awesome food and service"}
{"text":"There are a lot of places in town that specialize in Buffalo Wings so the competition in this field is quite stiff. That being said, this location of the Native New Yorker tends to be our favorite although they are not consistent in the quality of either their food or their service. Some nights the wings are big, meaty, and flavourful and other nights they are thin, dry and tasteless.  Service is also sketchy at this location, perhaps because we do not see the same servers over time. Perhaps they have a high turn over on their wait staff, but some nights the service is excellent and other nights not worth leaving a tip at all.  A nice selection of beers is a major plus, but the prices are tending to be a touch high so we rarely order beer anymore.  Their other menu items are very good including their burgers and sandwiches, the Beef on Weck is probably my favorite by far, this sliced roast beef and cheese on a lovely Kummelweck roll. Appetizers, and side dishes are quite good as well for the most part.  If you're looking for a typical \"sports bar\" place to hang out, watch the game and munch, then the Native New Yorker will fill the bill nicely. They should actually receive 4 stars, but because they are so inconsistent I felt it effected the overall rating. Perhaps you will visit when they are having a good night."}
{"text":"As to be expected... Not awesome, but not the worst. Service is often slow and by some less than savory characters. Probably our only occasionally fun spot to hang out back in the Foothills of Ahwatukee. Watching the rich people sing karaoke is a kick and trivia night is also a fun one. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are all good for wings, chicken strips, and boneless wings...respectively. I go because it's close enough to walk to and stumble back. I will continue to go though."}
{"text":"I've been going to native new yorker for 30 years.  Although the wings used to be better back in the day, this place still has excellent wings."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight! We waited over 40 minutes for our food and the place wasn't even busy. According to our server, this happens every Monday. The kitchen just seems to fall apart she says. We asked for the check for our drinks so we could leave and they wouldn't charge us, which was the least they could do. This place is poorly managed! If you say this happens every Monday and nothing is being done about it, then maybe they should fix the problem or just close on Mondays. We will never be back again!"}
{"text":"Service was ok (4/5 stars) but the food was awesome and the atmosphere was inviting. Went with family and it was very enjoyable. Wings were a good size as well as seasoned well with sauce. Wife got a server recommendation that was not on the normal menu. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was not bad and the service was pretty good but they had the worst draft beer selection in the valley. If you are coming here for the booze and karaoke do yourself and go somewhere else. The beer selection is seriously lacking compared  to the surrounding bars/restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken place I've tried in Mesa Arizona and its really good and really recommend it if you like chicken,Wings. Loaded tots are good(Tatar tots with cheese and bacon). and the wait time is fairly ok. Really enjoy the paintings. Lady that is not our waitress did all the work."}
{"text":"We went here to grab a burger and a beer.... Service was non existent and when the bartender did greet us she acted as if she was doing us a favor.    We went about 9:30pm this passed friday."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, consistently good food and even better service! Jenni is very attentive and super sweet! You will never have to hunt down your server as long as your in her area, my drink was never empty and my food was hot!"}
{"text":"Thanks, Dan, for the incredibly shitty service.   When you asked me if I wanted a box for the nine dollar calzone I'd only picked at because it tasted like something out of a rotten Lunchable, and I grimaced and shook my head no, it was because I couldn't imagine it tasting any better another day later. You said \"you didn't like it?\" and then disappeared for another 25 minutes to go shoot the shit with your co-workers, who were also on the clock. I, mistakenly thought you were possibly talking to your manager to redress the situation, or maybe thinking of something else to bring. Instead, you didn't ask if I wanted anything else and still put it on my bill.   Any of the food that takes skill to make here is a POS. Sure, my dinner salad was fine, but you can't really go wrong with lettuce and dressing. Everyone I went with, myself included, felt ill after eating here.   I don't even know how this place is still in business and I wish it wasn't. What a hell hole."}
{"text":"I love native New Yorker but this location especially has the worst customer service.! Was here on their opening week & it was probably the first && last time I had great service. There were more than enough staff members including two managers walking around... The last two times we have come here it takes 5 or more min for someone to come & take our drink order.! And only because I have to walk to the front to talk to the 4 hostesses that just seem to greet people. it's great coming in and being greeted but Native you don't need 4 people to do that. At least make them help with drinks.! I've been nothing but disappointed... Hope this turns around and quickly...! The food is great but the service is far from it...."}
{"text":"Went to native several times over the past months and one of the reasons it is better is because of Roberto he is a hard worker all of the time and always looks out for customers whether at tables or at the bar. He helps the bartenders,  waiters or waitresses and pays attention to detail. Thanks Roberto."}
{"text":"The absolute best Native that I have ever visited. Beautiful decor.  TVs everywhere. Tunes rock and the manager said volume on for football games. Georgeous patio.  Had lunch at the bar and Mari, the bartender, was so attentive and nice I had to post a photo. My wings were perfect and fresh. The beer selection s excellent. Full bar. This is going to be Epic football place. So glad they opened this one. Classy. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Prices went up and they no longer have buzztime game units. Boo as we like to play trivia as a family!"}
{"text":"Really great wings, the staff is super friendly, especially Jake behind the bar. The only complaint i have is that its a little pricey.  I would go back, in fact i go there quite often."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I really enjoyed the new queso with pork. The atmosphere was fun and entertaining during karaoke.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive and we enjoyed having the football games on the TV as well as the music.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and lets just say its not what it use to be the wings aren't what they use to be they mess up orders quite often most of the waitresses are slow native is just another ordinary place now nothing special"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit with my wife and mom and we decided to have lunch here. Our server was Elise who was super friendly and attentive. The wings were good and so was the steak sandwich we all ordered. We decided to order a pizza that was half Garbage and half Chicken Buffalo to take home for dinner later. We are from Seattle, which has some amazing New York style pizza places and this pizza was one of the tastiest that we have had in Phoenix so far. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Came here last night to grab some dinner and to watch the Mayweather fight with my brother . There was a $25 cover charge per person but it wasn't a big deal. You had to spend $15 per person per hour to retain your seat if not you got the boot. And yes we actually saw people being booted or moved. This was no problem either as I understand that they have to make money during these events. What bothered me however was that some tables only had waters and one entree and nobody bothered them the entire night.  My table however kept getting bothered every hour to order something.  I'm not sure if the people across from us knew someone at the restaurant or what  but I just found it a bit bothersome that they were lounging with their water while we had a buffet at our table.  Regardless we still managed to have a decent time. There was 2 of us at my table so we ordered a 24 piece wing platter, tater tot appetizer, 1 large meaty beast pizza, 1 buffalo chicken dip appetizer, 5 beers and 2 drinks. The wings were ok. Very small in size compared to BWW. The flavor that stood out the most was the Asian garlic and Lemon pepper. The tater tots were delicious and crispy. The meaty beast pizza was thin and just ok. Very salty, lots of sauce and i didn't care for the bacon on the pizza. The service was decent but I asked for a refill on my soda and the waitress dissapeared and never came back. It wasnt until she brought me the bill that she remembered my drink. The fight was whack, the ambience just ok so overall experience nothing special.  I don't think I'll be coming back to Native anytime soon unless I'm craving tater tots."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Food was obviously cooked fresh. Staff is really friendly. By far the best native I have ever been in.  Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch after golf. Server didn't bring water and we had to beg for straws for our drinks. Food prep very slow and reztaurant is empty. We ordered lettuce wraps and meatball sliders...waiting almost 30 minutes since ordering and still no food. First time at this restaurant chain and this will be the last time"}
{"text":"I grew up going to the Native New Yorker on Broadway in Tempe. That place is the spot! I thought this place would be as well. I came in here with my date on a Sunday afternoon after church to catch the Cardinals and eat my one of my favorite foods in the world:  Chicken Wings!!!   First let me say, this place has TV's everywhere you look and we were able to grab a seat right away. I don't normally go to sports bars for Sunday football so something I thought was unique was they labeled all the TV's with signs for which games will be playing on what TV. Good if you're trying to stake your spot for the early morning and afternoon round of games. Service was great, our waitress was attentive and I have no complaints there.   Where it goes bad is the wings were so sad. I always get \"hot\" wings, literally the hot favor ones because I likes the spice. They were so dry it looked like they have been reheated in a microwave. Eatable yes, but Native New Yorker quality, no. I understand these are all independently owned, so Mr or Mrs Business Owner, go holla at your franchisor on making better wings.   Maybe it was an off day, or the cooks were really busy due to the Sunday crowd but for a place known for wings (they have a buffalo in their logo for goodness sakes!) ya'll could do a lil' better on the only reason why I would go to you."}
{"text":"Not going back.  Liked to stop in for lunch, but the bartender or servers only care about \"the regular\" drinkers that go in there.  Last time \"a regular\" that the bartender knew rather well, asked me to move my seat just as my lunch arrived. Then went promptly outside smoked a cigarette and plopped down next to me. Gag. I moved my seat AGAIN to a table seat.  Bartender saw this, didn't ask me if I needed anything else. Never came over. The wings were sub-par that day as well..not really hot and flavor was off.  Also, there is a tall thin metro bartender with a beard whom...I swear hates people.  Have given this place a chance over the years, either on my own for a quick lunch, or with friends before a flick because it is convenient, but..I'm done now. Don't like the service, they are usually understaffed in bar area during busy winter times and it's hot/stuffy in there, and the food is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"Favorite wing place! Came in for lunch this week, the restaurant was very clean all the staff was very attentive and friendly. We ordered our wins extra extra crispy (which is a challenge for most places) and these guys nailed it! Wings were deliciously crispy and bartender, although she was super busy came by enough times to gives us great service. This is definitely our new hangout spot! Cant wait to go back and try some of their craft beers! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best wings! JACKSON is the best host! Me and my kids come here all the time to watch the latest in sports. Food is reasonably priced and all the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Food isn't great.... We live across the street and we hardly ever eat here.  I'd recommend uncle bears for bar food and atmosphere over this place."}
{"text":"Came in today with a big group of people, 9 adults and 2 babes. Tina was so amazing! She helped us move tables around and get settled in. The whole staff was amazing and did everything they could to accommodate us, going above and beyond to get several different football games playing.   Thanks everyone!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the same Native where I spent many nights eating wings and watching games. We went to this location today and i had to flag someone down from the bar after waiting about ten minutes (with a baby and car seat) to be seated. There was no one at the hostess station. I ordered barbecue hot and medium wings.  Both were drowned in sauce and warm at best when they came out. They have gone to bigger wings but they were way over cooked and dry and it seems as though they were trying to cover that fact up with all the sauce. I ordered twenty wings and a salad with iced tea. The tea was old and the wings were very similar to Denny's wings. Except that Denny's wings are at least cooked correctly. After we were seated I do have to say the server was attentive and prompt. Sad day for me but I believe this is the last time I go here. Seems like they forgot what made them the best wing spot in AZ.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided wings were a good choice for dinner. Decided on Native. Near by and never a wait. Several of us ordered wings and o order a Native Burger. All delicious and made to order.  To top it off, their happy hour is awesome! Large draft beers and mixed drinks for only $5. Can't beat those deals.  Cassie was our waitress. She even gave her advice on how to fix up her version of a Long Island ice tea.  No complaints here. We had a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst wings. Few years back my friends and I would frequent a few times a week. But after the renovation before the fire. The prices went up over 3 bucks for a dozen wings. Plus the wings are horrible, as if they get them from KFC. I wish they would go back and purchase quality wings. My advice, go to Doc & Eddy's in tempe. Those wings are amazing and only $8 per dozen. Order them grilled, you will thank me."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was not that great. Went late on a sunday night. Lots of wait staff around but being the only table on the dinig side we got ignored. The person who was our waitress was over on the bar side except to bring our food. Brought our check and it took her 15 minutes to come back and it."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I often come here after a long day at the office.  They have a pretty good afternoon and late night happy hour.    The staff is super friendly and outgoing and they are good at remembering what you like to order. Apparently, they specialize in their wings, which were kind of small and pretty ordinary. The food is usually just warm, but never steaming hot, and it seems like they may use microwaves for quite a few items on the menu.  The pizza I have had there is pretty good though.  However, I would avoid the karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights.  Every time we've been there the clientele singing was painfully awful, lol."}
{"text":"Disappointed in a few things about this place. First, if we want to add something such as mustard on a sandwich, there is no option to ADD items, only to remove. Secondly, because of this, one ordering online is forced to leave it alone, or call the restaurant requesting the change be made. Third, the kitchen staff doesn't check the special order requests and prepares the order as it comes, instead of to the customers preference. We had the person on the phone repeat the order AS WE HAD REQUESTED IT both times repeat the order to my husband correctly. He got home and one of the meals was made correctly, the other was not even close. So, another 10 minute drive each way to get that resolved. Now, a positive, and the reason for the 3 stars: the manager that I was unknowingly transferred to, Brooke, was super apologetic, assured me it would be remade, correctly this time, and that she would speak to her kitchen staff about the mistake. We're not looking for anything in return, we just want the food to be consistently made as requested. Having their website updated to accommodate those who would like to make notes/comments/additions to their orders would be quite helpful as well."}
{"text":"Can beat this place if your looking for a great deal...50% off apps. 3-7pm. Best part is you can call in and dine out...that's a rare deal!!"}
{"text":"Native New Yorker: Why did you change your wings recipe?  Your wings used to be juicy and saucy.  The past 3 times I've ordered wings (medium/traditional), they have been dry, the skin over cooked and lacking in sauce.   Same experience at other Native New Yorkers.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be back for wings."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is your average pizza and wings joint. The good thing is that they don't just serve pizza and wings. There are plenty of sandwiches, burgers, sliders, and salads to choose from too. There are TV's everywhere showing all types of sports going on. Tuesdays are cheap wing days (25 cents, I think. I could be wrong) and Thursdays are boneless wing days..mmm boneless wings. I only go there when I'm craving some grease, so that tells you the quality of the food. It's not bad at all, it's just not good for you! Even most of their salads come with something fried on top of them. I would imagine the place loads up after work. I've never been. Today I had their buffalo chicken pizza. Eh... it wasn't spicy at all. I was kind of bummed. The waitress gladly brought me a side of wing sauce to give it a kick. My lunch pal had some wings and potato skins...healthy. He said that everything was delicious. We made a deal to come back and try the boneless wings on Thursday...stand by for an update. Bottom line, Native New Yorker is an a-ok place to eat! Nothing terribly fancy, but your run of the mill sports bar. Not a bad place for a wing fix at lunch time!"}
{"text":"The two times of being here at this specific location service was just HORRIBLE! And the worst part, they were not even busy! Food is okay... But our waitress was very slow and not on top of it... I could be a better server/waitress than her! Food came out not hot. She was giving attitude as well."}
{"text":"15 mins and the server finally asks us what we want to drink....wow...I thought it was supposed to have gotten better.  Won't be coming back here..."}
{"text":"Really I was hoping this would be a good place to eat because Buckeye has a limited number of places to dine- WHAT a disappointment this turned out to be. My husband and son ate at a different location when we first moved to Az and they said it was not too good but we tried it tonight and let me tell you- I hated this place so bad I had to yelp to at least get started what is sure to be horrible reviews that are on the way. First, the place was full (just opened last night) so as you can imagine it took forever to get our food but the minute it came I wanted to laugh.  My pizza looked to like a Celeste frozen job that should run about a buck at your local Walmart- seriously not kidding. As far as the taste it was micowave-ish and the crust was like hard horrible cardboard. My husband also had a pizza, buffalo chicken and his was a little better but same crust and to compare buffalo chicken pizza, we had the new Papa John's last week and that was pretty darn good. My son had chicken tenders, total bar food and total blah. We tried a few different wing flavors ( 49 cent wing Thursdays) and they were okay but this place is on the Never-Go-To-Again in my book. Save your money and avoid cheap, overpriced crap. Our bill was just under $50.00 with a tip, 2 cokes, 1 water, not ever a beer. Buyers remorse..... Should have hit the Buckeye Chipotle, THATS always great :)"}
{"text":"Basic chain restaurant bar food. Wings are pre-cooked (fried). Unless you specifically request that the wings be prepared \"fresh\", the skin resembles and taste like pig ears and are greasy. Native is one of the only non fast food restaurant in the Foothills and thus the attraction."}
{"text":"Ehhh my friends said the wings were good. I think they were OK at best. But I am picky. This was just another bar food type place. I would never crave this place but if someone wanted to go here I wouldn't object nor would I get excited lol"}
{"text":"New to the area and we like this place pretty well. I like their wings, especially the ones that are boneless like strips. Its a pretty casual laid back atmosphere, sports bar style. We go with our kids though all the time. They run pretty good specials on Tues and Thursdays. We've had pretty good service each time we've gone."}
{"text":"I went into this place for a beer but left with hope. The service from Felicia was outstanding and her charm was beyond amazing. She constantly checked up on us and made us feel right at home. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"$0.35 cent wing Tuesdays... Good wings and a killer price... Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"We always have a good time at native. A couple times they have forgotten our salad when we ordered the pizza and wings deal but other than that the kids love the food and we love the games!"}
{"text":"Not the best food, but definitely not the worst. I really like all of the TVs in the bar area, makes it easy for everyone to get a good view of the game.  Wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or anything, unless you're both sports fans, in which case sure why not.  Going here for Happy Hour is the BEST, and I highly recommend it because the wings are a great deal."}
{"text":"We had an awful experience this afternoon. Horrible costumer service, the food took more than 35 minutes and it wasn't good. The beer was flat and we told the waitress about it and all what she said was, \"oh the bartender said that it's all what we have right now\" we complained to the manager before we left and honestly she seemed to care less. It used to be one of our favorite places but not anymore."}
{"text":"You will 100% regret ordering the buffalo ranch dry rub wings.  Besides those gnarly things the rest are pretty good."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. Burger and Fries were $7 on the lunch special and were fantastic. We also ordered the one pound of boneless wings for $7.99 (usually $10 when not during the lunch special), they were as good as Wing Stop at a fraction of the price. Our total meal was $16.56 after tax. The service was fantastic. Honestly being just one light farther down the road, I have no idea how Chili's is even in business with Native so close. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The Native New Yorker turned out to be the pitch perfect place for our after theater party and karaoke on Friday night, November 15th.  Having spoken to the manager, Jenny, in advance, we were able to reserve the semi-private dining area for our group.  Jenny and her staff did an outstanding job setting up the space and then serving our needs with genuine smiles and professional efficiency.  Many in our group had dinner and the wide selection of appetizers and entrees gave us lots of options so everyone was able to get what they wanted and in the price range that worked for them.  While I didn't eat, my friend Robin enjoyed her chicken, bacon and ranch flat bread.  Robin's husband mostly enjoyed the wide selection of draft beer.  It was one of the guy's birthday and the ice cream sundae his wife got him was big and delicious!  What a great spot for casual dining and drinks and a really fun time!! And they comped my diet coke - apparently a common occurrence for DDs.   **co-written with award-winning playwright Robin Kramme."}
{"text":"We always come to this place for some good wings:)   This place seems more family oriented than that one in Tempe, probably because the bar is separated from the dining area.. Waitresses are nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Well today must have been a bad day for Native Grill and Wings. Service was poor. We got our drinks and appetizer and the waitress forgot about us. 35 mins later she came back. I get when your short handed, but at least try to acknowledge the customer to let them know. However what bothered me the most was that she was rubbing the sweat off her face with her hands. NOT OKAY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty poor experience here. Came here to watch March Madness for lunch, like the many other people that were sitting on the bar side. Was seated quickly and given drinks right away. But took a while to get our order. After we put in our order, it took over an hour to get our food. The place was severely understaffed. Maybe 3 total people (that I saw) that were working the bar, serving, and seating customers. The bar was maybe half or 2/3rds full, and there was one point that we noticed nobody had any food in front of them.  Positives of this experience:  -Our waiter was kind and checked up on us a lot, but it got to a point where we just had to ask how much longer until our food was ready. He'd ask us how we were doing, but what else can you say when you've been asked that repeatedly and it's been over an hour waiting for you food? -Good amount of Tvs on the walls in the bar area, so you could watch the games no matter which way you faced.  Big question we had:  Why were they so understaffed and under prepared when its a day that many people will go to a bar during lunch to watch march madness? Especially as a sports bar? You'd think they would know."}
{"text":"I mostly go to drink beer at this location.  When they first opened up, the service was horrible.  Took an hour to get a pizza, rang up wrong products on the order......but cut some slack.  The service has definitely improved.  The last time I went in, we had an AWESOME server.  The wings were a little dry...I like my wings slathered in sauce.  The appetizer was a little \"eh.\"  Kudos to the service, but the wings sure have gone downhill....which is a shame. I used to rave about Native NY back in 1993 to my friends back in Wyoming, but now......not so much."}
{"text":"Two stars is actually generous! We have been regulars at Native NY'er because I have always loved their wings.  We also go since they are supporters of the 100 club & my husband LEO.  At the spur of the moment we decided to go.  I had my son that's 4 and a 15 month old.  The young girls at the desk said, how many... We said two adults, a child and baby, table please? Response was, a booth okay?  First off NOT listening!  How can you seriously expect a little toddler to sit in a booster seat that has no straps! Would you like a lawsuit?  So we get to the table and then had to ask twice for a high chair until we just got one ourselves.  It was sticky, full of food from previous child and just down right disgusting, of course only one left in that area, so we had to go back to the car to get a blanket so I felt comfortable with my child sitting there. After taking drink orders, she came back not even two minutes and asked if we were ready to order? Seriously???? We just sat down, got settled, took the 4 year old to the bathroom, we hadn't even opened the menu. I got wings as part of signing up for the rewards program and said onion rings to come with my wings NOT prior.   Onion rings show up 5 minutes later!  20 minutes later a burger, grilled cheese and chicken strips show up.  My wings tasted a bit weird, but couldn't put my eye on it.  But the minute we got home and until 5am my body told me something was wrong.  Don't know if the wings were cooked thoroughly or not, but I was sick!!  Sad to say, it will be a while before we go again.  Time to try some newer places.  Waitresses- here and other restaurants also.  STOP putting scolding hot plates in front of a child.  Their first instinct is to touch it and then guess what, dinner is ruined because your kid had burnt blister!  Also do you think a one year old can just chow down into a sandwich without it being cut up? Common sense!!! As the parent where you would like the plate, it's not hard  *Addition based on \"compliment\" of my review I received, to the jacka$$ that sent it, re-read what I wrote about common sense when it comes to being a good waitress/waiter, be observant and AWARE of your customer and their needs and listen.  I said we needed a table, response was \"is a booth okay?\" I have also walked in the shoes, did it, done it and was good at it!  So go back to work and STFU, I hope I never come in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was great. I tried boneless mandarin orange. I was told it tasted like orange chicken, only It didn't taste anywhere near orange chicken. I was disappointed.  I will try this place again, I always give places another try."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! The service, food, and atmosphere are great. We've been to several Native's but this particular location cooks their wings just the way we like them. It gets really busy on Friday nights but I suppose that's to be expected. The bar area is the best - all the TV's make it an ideal place for college football Saturday's.  The only place that comes close is Zipp's, but their wings aren't nearly as good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for wings! They are the best, especially the ghost pepper wings! Good service and atmosphere. A great place for sports with a lot of TVs inside and outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent service as always. We went to watch football and were treated like family. Thanks Garret for taking the extra step to be a great server. The chicken and waffle wings, yeah I typed that we're beyond awesome. Possibly one of the best bloody Mary's ever!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take a pic, but I ate everything. Only complaint - they dust their wings & I forgot to ask for naked. Redeeming point is that they are priced right & don't care how many flavors you order. For a wing swinger like me, I'm thrilled. This is too much to pass up.  Leann is a wing slinger extraordinaire. They allowed every combo I could throw at them. Pushing the envelope to a fifth star.  Go for it - get all wing crazy."}
{"text":"I just tried the Native New Yorker for the first time and thought it was pretty good pizza. It doesn't quite rank up there with the best, but definitely good nonetheless. The wings are also as good as you would expect and the service is not bad either. I found the prices to be quite reasonable, which pleases me and is definitely something that will encourage to come back for more."}
{"text":"Great Service & Great Food + fun time playing poker on buzztime."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and I am so happy they are back in my area! Great food and customer service! Great customer service! Had previously had bad experience here recently and was determined to give another chance as they recently reopened in my area and I always loved this place. I can tell you I am very happy I did, yes they may have took a little bit to get me my dinner as I watched my friends eat but I have to keep in mind they recently reopened and have all new staff that are still learning as we are all only human.  The management and staff all have the best customer service from the moment you walk in the door and the food is on point so I can't complain and happy to have them back in the area!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times over the years and the food and service used to be good but the last three times have been horrible. We were there last night for dinner at 6 PM, even though the restaurant was almost empty, we waited almost 15 minutes for a table. Once we finally got taken back we asked for a booth (we have a toddler and it's easier to contain him) and the host acted like we're were being crazy, then made us stand in he middle of the dining area while he asked someone about our request.  He then made us continue waiting while he cleaned a booth despite 4 other open clean booths in the same section. Once we were seated the waitress came over and took our drink order.  While we were waiting for drinks two other parties were seated near us, ordered, and received their drinks and we were still without even a beverage.  We decided to leave and a member of our party spoke with the manager and explained why we were leaving and the manager just said \"OK\" and watched us leave.   This experience has been the worst ever at this location, we will not be going back nor will our friend who accompanied us.    Corporate needs to get involved with this location because the management obviously doesn't know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I live down the street so when I saw that they were putting a Native in I was excited! This shopping center has sat vacant for many years but in the last year it has really come alive do to many incredible businesses. If your on a date, having a family night out or just by yourself this shopping center is a one stop shop for all of thee above.   I have eaten at Native twice now. Bright yet cozy with many TV's for all to enjoy a game. Not like some places that the TV's make it impossible to have a nice conversation with those you came with. Both times our waitresses were on point. Stephanie took care of us last night. She's Great! The Assistant Manager Erik remembered my wife and I from the first time we came. Great Guy! Service and food are amazing.   Im a GM at a very large company so I know it takes time to get new employees on track. Don't listen to any of the negative reviews from the first day or 3 that the place opened. Grow up people...of course there's going to be a few hick ups in the beginning. But they have it down to a science now. Great job Native!!"}
{"text":"The waitress sucked. Very slow. Inattentive when they were slow. The food wasn't good. Strippers over fried. The manager was over and answered a question about the chicken and was rather arguementative and she literally said.... The place we get the chicken from sometimes sends wings out to us with feathers still on it. Just ruined our appetites.. 2 people left after eatting and their stomachs  were upset. Been to this location several  times. Never again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a company department lunch, big mistake.  terrible food and terrible service. The bartender was our server, but bless his heart, he tried.  we waited close to 30 minutes for our food, which isn't ideal for when you're on company time. I ordered a lunch special, salad and with what ended up being breaded boneless deep fried chicken strips, however from the menu pic it looked like they were grilled chicken strips.  It wasn't, so I was very disappointed, but i tried to eat it and it was as bad as I knew it would be. Don't go to NNY, every experience i've had there has been terrible."}
{"text":"If we ever want wings we come to Native New Yorker.  Yes there are other places that make them, but we live close by and we like them.  This place had tons and tons of tv's and tons of seating indoors and outdoors.  We've never had a problem with our orders etc.  I always order the Hot wings and Honey Hot.  Tuesdays they offer cheaper wings and i will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"We reserved a table for 30 for 8pm early in the day giving the manager enough time to accommodate. The evening manager informed us when we arrived that he had changed our reservation because the other manager should never had set up the reservation on a 'football' night. We waited 40 minutes to take our order. Another 30 min for food to start coming and we had to get our own silverware and napkins because people were getting food without having anything to eat with. Horrible management. Horrible service. Too bad because the food wasn't bad!"}
{"text":"Their wings are tiny, much smaller than KFC and not nearly as good as Venezia's. Their pizza is similar to  Domino's. Their wait staff is the worst...terribly disorganized and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Real dumb \"gee whiz I dunno\" attitudes. Just a lousy sports bar, not a place for good food or service."}
{"text":"What if I told you karaoke Friday nights isn't such a great idea? Gave me headache when I'm buzzed. Otherwise wings and the server was exceptional. Do your karaoke night on a Monday night when no one is at native."}
{"text":"Good time every time me and my family come to eat...but I do have to say the salads could be a little better and you need a bigger selection of desserts..."}
{"text":"Came  here some food and still bad food. Salad I had was straight out of the freezer. Not sure what is going on here but place had gone down hill and with Buffalo Wild Wings and Dave and busters across the street you would think it would be better."}
{"text":"This place gets better all the time. The only things better than the wings is the service. Thanks Jacob and Renee."}
{"text":"Place was gross when we went. When you first walk in you can't see any of the seating so your not sure if you went in the correct door or not, it's very old and run down. The blinds next to our table were covered in god who knows what, sauces maybe? Gross, dust on the window seal which the table is very close to the blinds. The only reason why we came to native was because my husband likes wings and so I decided to order some wings as well needless to say I could of went without eating. Not happy with this native and will not return I will choose a different location in the future."}
{"text":"Wings (strippers) are always good here for Lunch.  Great price $7 with a salad! Enjoying the stripper special with wings for 49 cents"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time and each time has been progressively worst. I would liken it to the same price point as Applebee's but not even the same quality of taste. The biggest draw I would say is the UFC PPV that are worth the trip with their wings which are probably one of their only saving graces.  Even on that note it would only be an idea if BWW was to packed."}
{"text":"Good wings, but horrible place for a date.   We've had Native wings delivered to our house and really enjoyed them, so after our last date night we thought we'd stop by in person, grab a table, and split an order of wings. What a letdown!  Service was very slow and the place was not even that busy. It didn't seem like they were understaffed, but it took a bit too long any time we wanted to get a hold of our waiter. It's definitely a spot for families, and there were lots of kids running around and jumping on the booths. The tables were covered in dirty plates and napkins, and the floor had menus dropped on it under a bunch of the tables.   TLDR: order their wings as take out, but don't come here to sit down in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wish this business would step up their game. Each time I've ordered wings here I am even more unsatisfied with my purchase. With such a simple menu, I'd expect this place to have awesome wings and when my recent 9/11/15 order of wings to go came to me soggy rather than extra crispy, (I live less than 5 min away) I decided to forgo my wings and eat salad instead. Just because your the only Native in Queen Creek doesn't mean your business will remain steady. Competition is arising and now would be the time to take servicing the customers seriously. People expect to enjoy the food that is paid for."}
{"text":"Waldine is the best! Every time we come in she makes us feel so at home and welcome. We definitely always come to the bar in hopes she is here, and are never upset when we leave! Thank you Waldine!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in we received no welcome or hello. The hosts was rude and short with us. The place was no even busy and it took the host awhile to seat us. Our waiter was great and met our needs very quickly. Pizza was not very good, but wings were great."}
{"text":"Great food and stuff! Hosted a Paint Nite event here. The service was wonderful and we decided to stay after for dinner, yum! I love there dry rub wings and delicious cocktails."}
{"text":"I love Native New Yorker, however having just left the Gilbert Rd location, I will never go to another location and will tell all my friends that this location actually let's children in the bar. Not to drink , but isn't that the point of going into the bar is to be away from kids?  There are over 7 family's here now with their kids age ranging from 3 months to 12. This is so not acceptable. I vow to make sure this gets changed !"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. Wings were ok, service was ok. The hot ones are not hot. I tried the ghost wings and it has a nice kick to it. Fries were a bit salty. My guess is the wings were pre-cooked because they were at my table about 10 minutes after I ordered them. I will not make any special trips to go back here when I'm in town. It was walking distance from the hotel but next time I might walk a bit further to try something else."}
{"text":"I love the Native New Yorker here. It's such great customer service and every waiter I've ever gotten has always been so nice and eagerer to attend in any kind of way. It's a very clean location and fast service compared to the other native New Yorkers I've been too in the past. Highly recommend this location if you are looking for a great clean and fast service environment with great customer service to top it off"}
{"text":"one of the worst places ever to spend your dollar. The old native that used to be there before this one was way better. The wings are ok. But everything else just tastes like it was frozen and then microwaved and given to us. I would never go to any other native because of my experience their."}
{"text":"First time visitor and waitress really made it a great time. She told us about the mobile app and was very attentive to our table and dining needs."}
{"text":"I AM A NATIVE NEW YORKER...and I think this place should be ASHAMED of themselves! Got pizza and traditional wings...total crap!  WHO BREADS THEIR WINGS???!!  S.T.O.P.!  Got them \"hot\"...bluck. Pizza was cardboard.  They need to change their name, cuz they're a disgrace to New York quality pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I love wing day/night! I have ate here many times. Usually order take out for lunch. I've always been greeted with friendly service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the 1st time since it opened. We will not be back either. I'll just bullet point the issues to keep it simple. The first thing I should have noticed was the half empty parking lot during prime time at a restaurant on saturday night. But we dared to enter anyhow, here what happened: *Greeters where friendly enough, this was the best part of the night. *Server took about 10 mins before coming to table to get drink order. (The restaurant was maybe 50%full at 7pm) *We gave our order. A pork quest dip, a chicken parm sandwich, a bacon cheeseburger -ordered medium and a kids chicken strippers. *Food took about 50 mins to come out, the server said our food was waiting on the tater tots for the kids meal. *Food had sat in the heat window for a considerable amount of time as it was barely warm when delivered. My burger was well done, dry and had zero flavor.The lettuce, onion and pickles on top were wilted and dried out from sitting under heaters. The chicken parm sandwich looked so bad/dry it could have been reheated microwave leftovers. The tater tots were barely warm, but the chicken strippers were piping hot (thank goodness) Fries on both our plates were old and chewy, not crispy in the least. *Server wasn't checking on all tables, just one at a time and my child never got the wing sauce because we couldn't catch her attention and she never checked on us. *Ice tea drink went unfilled (and had hardly any ice to begin with) and the request for a cup of ice was never fullfilled. *We stacked plates, put napkins on them and waited for about 10-15 mins for a check. **Redeeming quality!! The manager came and talked to us when the server told her were weren't happy. *Then more dissappointment, the $5 off coupons she gave us expire in 3 days.   Sorry Native, your restaurants were good in the 90's, but not so much now."}
{"text":"As always   This location has always been awesome   The food, service and awareness are always spot on    The manager Ashley always takes time to come check on us with a smile    We love it here"}
{"text":"Food is average nothing to write home about. When you're looking to fill that cheesey pizza & greasey  wing craving this place will satisfy it. The service in the restaurant seems to be slower then the bar. So when I pop in it's the bar because the service is better. The deals for ladies on Saturdays look like a really good deal. Haven't made it only because I'm not a Karaoke fan & there's karaoke here on the weekends."}
{"text":"Worst service ever...we came to have dinner and the dining area isn't even busy to be back up for an hour. The bar side was busy and yet they got service within 15 minutes of getting seated. Another family sat next to use and they got served with their appetizers before ours even came out. When our food came out it wasn't even fresh or hot it was warm and it felt like it was sitting there for awhile. My wings was warm my daughter Mac and cheese was warm and her tater tots taste like it was a day old and my husband burger was not medium well done and it was dry and semi-cold that he couldn't even enjoy it. Basically I felt like they were favoring other customers I mean we are paying customer too. I take it personally when my 5 year old starts to ask mommy where is my food and it take an hour for her food and I specifically told them I want hers dinner to come out first. So 1 star for poor customer service and lack of attention to the customer orders and recommendations."}
{"text":"I go here often , the wings are really good but they don't put enough sauce on them sometimes and the pizza is alright but, overall this is a good spot to watch sports and hangout with friends ."}
{"text":"I'm was tempted not to give them 4 stars but i can honestly say that the only thing during this visit that was worth criticizing was the size of or the lack of size to the chicken wings.  I know the world is not perfect but that has been one of the complaints  I have found here to be repetitive, along with crappy service.  The 3 different wing styles I ordered were very tasty, full of flavor, the beer was cold and the service was excellent.  Now, I may have cheated a little bit by sitting at the bar where I thought \"how can they screw up service when I am sitting right in front of them?\" I will be back and sit at a table to see how service is and Im going to order a combo of the chicken strips and boneless chunks to see if they are also small.  It seems like a Food Vendor issue for the size of the wings and of course they get the smaller wings at a lower price probably.  Changing vendors would solve that problem.  The place was packed so it cannot be all that bad."}
{"text":"Having a 3 star rating you think they would be trying to satisfy customers but that is clearly the least of their worries. Called to get a to go order on happy hour and this one time it doesn't apply on to go orders. But last week and EVERY TIME BEFORE IT HAS. But that's not what I'm ranting about; to top it off the manager was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Couldn't believe they would have someone so rude to customers running a place. Something needs to be done about him."}
{"text":"We love Native Grill.  Our food was great and the service was excellent.   We especially love the chicken \"strippers\".  Our waitress Stephanie was awesome.  We had full drinks, yummy food, and a great family time here.  We love coming here and will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from Tempe and use to eat at Native a few times a week! We were pretty excited to have one pretty close, but after we went there we changed our minds. We ordered ToGo food for lunch, they said it would take about 10 minutes, we drove there and sat for another 10ish minutes. Waiter was very rude to me, no thank you or have a good day, she wanted her money that was it. When we got home my pork was hard to pull, the bread was stale, and my fries weren't fully cooked. My boyfriends wings were so hard to the point where we couldn't eat them & several were undressed. We are ashamed because we love this place, but we definitely will not return to this one."}
{"text":"Awesome boneless wings, great happy hour, our bartender Jake was super friendly and gave us awesome service"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was good will come back. The only negative item was for some reason all the TVs has to be on the football game and playing loud hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Our server was not trained well, wings came out slightly warm if not cool in temperature. Our one pound boneless chicken wings where of two clearly different quantities and our server argued with me that they were the same. Drinks were left empty and the food made both of us sick to our stomachs one hour after eating. The table behind us had similar complaints. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and good food!  We invited around 30 guests to join us at Native Grill and Wings to celebrate our son's graduation and the staff was very accommodating from start to finish.  They helped us with our food selections a few days prior to the big day to ensure that we had enough food for everyone.  On the day of the celebration they sat us in a roomy portion of the restaurant and provided servers that were very attentive and a real pleasure to work with.   I'd highly recommend this location.  Anytime we're in Mesa this will be our go to place for eats and drinks."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a couple of times now. We love to go on Tuesday for the wing specials. Their wings are better than most I have ever had. They will do the wings naked or breaded, and they have a choice of around 30 different sauces! Their homemade chips are amazing also!   The only issue I have is that it is hit or miss on the service. One time I ordered a glass of wine and the glass came with lipstick on it. They were very helpful and quickly replaced it, but it shouldn't have happened. Also, the food tends to take A LONG TIME! We don't generally mind bc we aren't in a huge hurry, in my 9 year old has gotten antsy a few times.   Great Sports Bar, lots of TVS, always lots of different games on."}
{"text":"When we walked in, there was no hostess to be found. Took about 5 min for someone to come out and seat us. Once seated we ordered and the food arrived quickly. LOVED the homemade potato chips, but my Cobb salad was so so."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a Native New Yorker before. I have seen them everywhere but never actually went inside. Definitely never been to this neck of the woods. My girlfriend wanted to meet on her side of town and said this place had great wings. How could I turn it down. Good thing I was a little early because I accidentally walked into a different New York place and didn't realize it until after I had checked in, was seated and looking at the menu. Oops. Quick exit and over to the correct New York place on the other side of the same parking lot. I was seating right away and started looking at the menu. There was a pretty big wing selection. Now I am definitely in the right place. My girlfriend arrived and we ordered some loaded French fries and a dozen wings each. She got all medium and I got half medium and half honey bbq. The food came out pretty quick. The fries were really good. Lots of cheese and bacon. We ordered some ranch on the side for dipping. Nice a crisp fries. Very good. Now to try these famous wings. They were really good. Coated in sauce. Both favors were very good. Just the right amount of kick to the medium and the sweet bbq taste was a good switch. Lots of meat on the wings too. Cooked just right. Sure it was messy but that is the point. I will definitely be coming back here. I don't know if I can get by the wings and try other things on the menu but we will see. They get bonus points for having Kilt Lifter on tap."}
{"text":"Seems like every time I come here the only consistent thing here bad service. Decent food and messed up orders."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times with my family but today wasn't the best experience that I have had. The waitress was not that good. I asked for water with lemon and only got water with no lemon. We ordered tater tots and a zucchini appetizer and then for the main course we ordered wings. After a long wait the food finally comes to our table but the appetizers are missing. The waitress said that she forgot to put the appetizers orders in. It's time to eat and the chicken wings taste good. About halfway through my meal I finish my cup of water but the waitress never notices and I never get asked if I want a refill. I end up eating the eat the wings with an empty cup. Oh well I guess tonight on a Friday was too busy for them.  TL;DR :  The service was not to expectations but the food was good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  We waited over one hour for wings?!?!?!?  When I spoke with the manager he said it was our fault because we ordered a variety!!!!  We backed his kitchen up!!!!!  There were 10 of us!  If they don't let you order different flavors thy should tell you!!!!  The manager was a straight up jerk!!!!"}
{"text":"Update they have fixed the sound system and no more self playing Juke Box.   This is now Native Wings and has been remodeled."}
{"text":"Sarah was rude. Made us feel unwanted even though we were spending good money on food and drink. 2 of us in our group are in the industry. If you don't want people drinking cut them off. Don't suggest coffee or ignore them or not offer last call. Not one person was drunk or disorderly so I don't understand her rude behavior. I will not be back. Isn't the point of your establishment is to enjoy food and drinks? I'll take my money elsrwhere"}
{"text":"Awesome wings for. 49 cts, if you love hot and spicy, go for Suicide wings. Great beer selection bottle and tap, and specials with a super fun atmosphere, highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for my birthday. There's another closeby and hadnt been to this one before.  Happened to be Karoke night, and for a first timer, the DJ made sure I had a blast and we all did.  Ambience was perfect, not too loud, not too quiet.   Service was fantastic. Brendan was our server. He was attentive with his service with a nice sense of humor as well. Made sure we had whatever we needed whenever we did, was fast, and helpful with picking beers and ordering.  I ordered the hottest wings on the menu, listed as \"Ghost\". But I'm hard core. ..weren't too hot for me...just gave a nice slow constant burn, lol.  Check-in there. Sometimes they'll give a free menu item.  Sign-up for their email program and you'll get free wings for your birthday week!"}
{"text":"So, I had lunch at this place. The waitress was super nice an patiently endured the incompetence, and immaturity that came from my party. Big plus.   I had the boneless wings. The waitress took the order with a stressed smile. When the food came out the employee (not the waitress) had no idea what she was delivering, and we had to guess to whom what wings belonged to whom. It would help if the person deliver would have a clue. Any kind of clue. But no.   I expected a half a pound should do it, and it did. I didn't want anymore. They were not good. I would never order this again. I have no idea why I even ordered from the get go - but apparently I did. Regrets. Don't have the wings. This is all I had, and learn from my mistake.   This place is pointless and would be out of business if it had any competition in Buckeye - but its Buckeye. Avoid reasons to go here, is my advice. And if you can't - pack a lunch.   One star experience.. I give the waitress an additional star. Don't let her go NNY. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Good wings, but I miss the days when they were 10 cents and you could stuff your face for 5 dollars. :0"}
{"text":"I called ahead to find out if this location had a reverse happy hour (since pretty much all NNY locations do, but I wanted to be sure). I was told \"yes, it starts at 10pm,\" so my husband and I were excited to go for $.35 wings (Tuesday) and take advantage of some cheap drinks and apps.We arrived shortly after 10pm, and were told that we could sit in the bar area, but that the kitchen was closed. What?!  That wouldn't have been something to mention when I called? It was pretty disappointing to get there, then leave because we came to eat. Can't comment on the food or service, but the information given when I called in was certainly lacking. The \"lounge\" is open until 2am, but the kitchen closes at 10pm? That's just lame."}
{"text":"My family and I started going to Native New Yorker in Phoenix in the 90s. I have a huge family. We have had family gatherings at Native all across the valley. 20-30 people, loved it for years! Favorite wings, favorite pizza, great service. We were so happy to have one open here in San Tan Valley. The first few times we went to this location, it was okay. The last few times have been terrible. My last two orders I have phoned in orders to go only to get there and have them not be made at all. Sit around the bar for an additional 30 mins then on my last order I got home and found they made me the wrong pizza? It was late and my kids were tired so we ate. The pizza tasted like an over priced little Caesars pizza. We were totally disappointed, the wings are just not the same either, they totally lost their flavor. Me and my wife actually talked about how disappointed we were, it was like a family tradition for us.   Well I'm done, with this location anyway, I may still try another location. I'm in search for a new pizza and wings joint in the area."}
{"text":"I come here often and typically sit in the bar, never have any issues with the wait staff or people there. But today was horrible. There are about 10 people sitting at the bar. 2 raider fans one dolphin fan.  The TVs are full blast and I have to shout to my party.  Our waiter was horrible. I ordered 24 wings. He come back to say we only do increments of 5. So instead of asking to do 25 instead of 24, I mean it one more. Come on, he I guess said I can do 20. Which I couldn't hear because it's fucking loud. I guess shame on me for assuming he was going to offer 25. Not sure I'll come here again."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of the Native New Yorker (now Native Grill & wing) since about the early 80s. It was our family go to and favorite spot. Hospitality was always important to Floyd and Judy. We always felt welcomed and service was beyond wonderful. Since the changing of the name and franchise owners, it feels that the hospitality that was once important has faded away. I've been to this location numerous times as it is closer to where I live.  The last 3 times have been horrible. Our service was terrible. The bar tender had an attitude when my mothers Bloody Mary tasted more like a glass of tomatoes. I did a review through the Native app and was contacted by the General manager and received his sincere apology. I was informed I would receive a voucher to make up for the bad service in hopes to keep us coming back.  Thanks. I appreciate that. I don't want a free meal, I want good quality service that he Anderson's took pride in giving. Well 4 months have past. No voucher. No reply from a few emails to said General manger Sam Manherz.  If you're looking for ok wings and bad service Greenfield and baseline Native is probably the one you want. I will travel a little further to Mesa dr and brown to fulfill my Native needs."}
{"text":"I've been going to Native for years, they have the best wings in the valley in my opinion. Unfortunately their service has gotten worse in the past few years. I go a few times a month and I'll usually have a 50% chance of getting good service. The staff is usually very nice and friendly but they are just too slow on refills and bringing out food. Also, when I order an appetizer or beer I expect it to come out quickly BEFORE my meal. Still that being said I still continue to come here for the awesome wings, good beer, and good food in general (for bar food that is). Go on a promotional day to get wings at good price. One last thing, sometimes I wished they stayed open later, they are a bar, also be aware of karaoke night if thats not your thing."}
{"text":"Awesome Margaherita Pizza here. The crust was awesome. Wings were good as well. Sports-bar kinda joint with ample TV's to watch your sport of choice. Our server was very good."}
{"text":"If you like slightly warm (just barely above cold) food this is the place for you.  The evening started out with a nice warm greeting but ended with a cold blast. The wing sauce had good flavor but when you bite into a cold wing it ceases to amaze.  I placed an order for \" America's favorite wing sauce\" and the waitress did not understand what I meant as she did not know the menu made the above statement.   I would heed the reviews and not try it unlike I did.   Good luck."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. I got there at 12:30 and did not get pay my check and go until 2:30. I never even got my meal. The place had very few customers and still it took so long to get my meal I had to cancel my order and just pay for my drinks and appetizer.  Another customer also canceled her order. This is the first time I tried them since they deep fried my chicken wings with feathers still no it. In my opinion this is the worst managed place I have ever been to and I eat out dialy.  My drink was empty almost the entire time and when I asked for a drink or service she told me to waif because she wanted to bus the table behind me first.  NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"It's really inconvenient when you get home from picking up an order to go & you start taking out the food you ordered & there's something missing. It shouldn't be the customer's job to check the bag to make sure everything is there. Customers should feel confident that the establishment put everything in the bag."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, Native New Yorker is a fine place to eat some good food.  We used to go to the one that is in Chandler on Ray road.  That one started off great but as time went on (a year), we started to notice that the portions were getting skimpy.  Jaded by this, we started going to this location (Broadway).  This one is what they call a corporate location.  Meaning, not a franchise.  This is good because somehow they have better service, better food, & better portions.  Their employees are good at what they do.  I need to point out two people there.  \"Chester\" or his real name is Shay, is a great guy.  He knows how to be a great waiter to have.  When he started being a cook, we were sad he wasn't waiting on us anymore!  The reason I call him Chester is he looks like the front man from Linkin Park.  It's okay, cause now we have Alex.  Alex is the man!  Once you get him you'll never want to switch. To be continued...."}
{"text":"I like the wing specials they offer on Tuesday's and Thursday's.  So does everyone else because the place is always packed.  Get there early as we left on two occasions due to lack of seating."}
{"text":"Packed on a Tuesday night! I'm guessing it's due to their hot wing special. Tate our table clearer was super friendly. Excellent strawberry margaritas, on the rocks. We only ordered the appetizer platter but I will be back! Great menu with salads, sliders and wings!"}
{"text":"So ive been coming hear for 15+ years..... They just started charging for extra ranch!  Really??  Suck it up! Or give 1 at a time then start charging when you see the table hasnt even eatten what they have asked for.     Im not happy and this is bull S#!@"}
{"text":"We came in today to watch the Cardinals game.  Service was extremely slow and our server spent a great deal of time standing around talking to his co-workers rather than checking on us.  He would often walk right past our table and check on other tables around us as if we were not even there.  We did not feel welcome.  The worst part was that when we asked for captions on a TV for my girlfriend we were told that they cannot put them on any TVs.  I objected and told them that she cannot hear the TV and that it's normal for bars to put captions on for deaf people.  The manager came to our table to apologize that the captions would take up too much of the screen and it would interfere with other people being able to watch the game.  We did not find this answer to be reasonable and decided to relocate to a different place which would allow her to have captions."}
{"text":"Horrible Service! Took them 20 Mintues to ask me and my friends what we would like to drink. I'm pretty sure it dosent take 10 Mintues to get 4 iced teas. Then we just placed a simple order, 4 Cheese Burgers with Just Cheese and Lettece. Took them 45 Mintues to get that out. I was very upset. I asked some lady I think she was a manager to give me a discount because that was horrible service, she said if you don't like the service you can go somewhere else. Wow! Just rude. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANY ONE!!"}
{"text":"Visited here on 10/15 to celebrate my sons 17th birthday. It was his choice as he wanted to try somewhere different (not Buffalo Wild Wings for wings.)  We came around 4 pm to a virtually empty restaurant and sat at a high top, the bartender was our server. She was nice enough, wanted to rush us a bit on our orders until I informed her we hadn't ever been here and we're not familiar with the menu. It took her forever to come back and take our order then despite the lack of other customers. The food was just okay. The prices were just okay. They wings...barely okay. We ordered fries with our wings and the portions were so small compared to the price you pay. Unfortunately we learned if you want good wings you'll have to go to Booty's, that is unless your satisfied with just okay."}
{"text":"Ok Kids like it because of electronic games Food was okay  Service was good Most likely will not return"}
{"text":"The only great thing about this place is the cheap $0.49 wings on Tuesday and Thursdays.  Everything else is pretty average.  The happy hour prices are good and that ends at 7pm Mon-Fri.  I do not like how cramp'd the bar area is laid out.  Especially on a busy night and you're sitting on one of those tables in the middle and need to use the restroom.  You basically have to figure out a game plan to work your way out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food as well as the staff and the manager Jared has always gone above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect and if it isn't he always makes it right with us by knocking some cash off of our order and even buying us a free beer while we waite for the correct order. W elope this place and the bartenders are awesome too!! We love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This was second time there. First time they got drinks wrong, but fixed it and food was decent . Last night was HORRIBLE! We sat at table and waited 25 mins to get served. Ordered appetizers platter & two drinks. 30 mins later still no food and not even offered another drink since both were gone. Waiter kept saying,\"few more minutes , I'll check on it.\" Seriously hour later. No food and kitchen closed?! The cashier charged $4 for $3 vodka. And $8 to add cranberry juice to the other drink. The place is way over priced. POOR service. Lack of service really.   I will never waste the time and money to go there again. Sad, because couple months ago it wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. Kaela was our server and she was great. Love the $.49 wings and California Burger..."}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday to watch the game. They made us move tables three times even though we were the only ones in the whole establishment. We said we wanted to watch three games, the cardinals, Vikings, and redskins games. They wouldn't change one tv to the Cardinals game. Even though we are in ARIZONA. And the only ones in the restaurant. Also they had other games on multiple tvs but the redskins and Vikings were each only on one TV. We have been to many natives before and we love coming to them, they have always changed the tvs to accommodate us, gave us great service so coming to this one was a shock. Terrible service. Awful Sunday football experience. Don't come to this native. Go to the one on Broadway or the one on Guadeloupe for a good, real native experience."}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks.    Love the bartenders!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night wings! I don't know the exact promo but I know the parking lot is fully and the place is jumping. I usually get 4 of the 6 rubs for my wings and I'm satisfied. The food is good not great. Service is a hit or miss but overall I'd give it a 4. Lots of work needed to get the 5 star review but I'd default here on Tuesday sans cooking."}
{"text":"I really love their wings here! I always get great service and they have pretty inexpensive drinks. Great big patio to watch sports and outside bar. Even though they are known for their wings, you have to  try their pizza."}
{"text":"All new staff and doesn't seem like they are ready for a half way full restaurant. Took over an hour for my food and all I ordered was a burger and fries. I finally had to tell them to cancel the order because after an hr and a half there was still no sign of my food and half my party had already finished their food. I was with a party of about 16 and our food was coming out in spurts....smh they had to comp and cancel so much food it's not even funny and the poor servers were running around not having a clue what they were really doing. We had 2 waitress but only 1 was hanging in and actually checking on us, shout out to Jazmin! The manager came out after we asked for him and offered a subpar explanation about why the food was taking so long but since no burger for me ....I may go back after like 6 months when they get it together. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of Jazmin, she was a MVP!"}
{"text":"This review is for Take-Out Service only: I frequently go to this Native to get hot wings on my way home from work. When you call you can expect to almost always be placed on hold before putting in your order. The time they quote is usually spot on. However, how you pick-up the wings is kind of inconsistent. Sometimes, they ask for the color and make of your car and meet you in the Take-out order parking lot; other times you have to go to the door and ask for your order. My order is always correct and the wings are still crispy when I get home, so overall this is still a convenient and good place for wings."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place because of their chicken wings. I like their wings better than Buffalo Wild Wings. Unfortunately, what has ruined it for me is the cigarette smell in the restaurant. The dining area smells like cigarettes and the restrooms smell like cigarettes. I would like to try other branches but they are not open as late as this one. Sadly, I'm crossing this one off my list of places to dine after 10:00 pm."}
{"text":"I have never understood the appeal of this place.  The one across from us at Dobson/Guadalupe is always packed and it is awful.  Have been there to eat 3 times.  The burgers are MEH..Red Robin is a million times better, the pizza tastes like frozen and the salads look like something I can make at home..and everything is overpriced.  It is also dirty and the service can be very slow.  Not wasting my time/money there ever again.  Too many other good choices around town."}
{"text":"Tim is one of the nicest bartenders I have ever met he always serves you with a smile he is always courteous and is always happy to see people"}
{"text":"Not only was he service poor at this location but when I got home and my child ate her beef sliders they were raw and pink in the middle. This is completely UNACCEPTABLE especially for a child!!!! It's not even editable. I have no idea who thinks this is okay for a child. She is 3 years old. Just gross."}
{"text":"Not bad. Beer was cold. Wings were good. Service was decent. I would return. Run of the mill sports bar."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting a native wings. We were greeted and drink orders taken quickly. Food order taken shortly after. Our food came out fast. The food was good but nothing to right home about. Clean friendly place though."}
{"text":"Good bar food, cold beer, lots of TV's! Bathrooms could be a lot cleaner than they are, because the Men's room is down right filthy and worn, and needs an update. (Doesn't leave you with a good feeling, after you have just stuffed yourself with food, and then go to wash your hands in the filthy sink with buildup all over the faucet /fixtures)"}
{"text":"Went to Native today for a business lunch meeting.  The service and food were both exceptional.  I had the meatball sub.  This was one of the best I've had.  The bread was super soft and was almost like a garlic bread.  Meatballs were cooked to perfection and was covered with awesome melted cheese.  The waitress was super busy, but stayed on point.  Drinks were kept fully and our order came out fast.  Very satisfied."}
{"text":"I have give this native many chances because i live close!!! And l Love wings but they always fail every time my food is either cold or wrong !!!!  Plus when u walk in it has a weird smell."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sunday afternoon, between football games. When we arrived, it was half empty. Weird, for a sports bar on a Sunday during football playoffs. We were seated in the bar and given menus. After 10 minutes, we had to ask for a server. After another 8 minutes, he arrived. We ordered beverages, potato skins, six lemon pepper wings (LIGHTLY seasoned, please), and three sliders (one meatball, one burger, one BBQ pork). We got our drinks and we waited. The tea was good. The potato skins arrived, but had zero flavor. Ranch dressing helped. We waited. And we waited. When our food finally arrived, the wings were slathered in lemon pepper. My husband managed to eat three with the help of that ranch. He dared me to try one. Ever pour salt from the shaker into your hand as a kid and lick it? Bingo. That's what he had on his plate as well as on his wings. Meanwhile, my meatball slider was bordering on cool to lukewarm. I tried the BBQ pork---ICE cold. I even stuck my finger in the middle just to be sure. I didn't dare try the burger, which appeared bone dry. Guess you have to ask for mayo. We sent the sliders back and my husband opted to try to manage with the wings as is. Ranch helped. And we waited. Meanwhile, the server delivered food to the next table. As he removed items from his tray, a container of sour cream/ranch slid off the back of the tray and splattered all over the floor and across the entire aisle to the feet of the patrons at the table across from us. He didn't even notice. As he walked away, he eventually did notice, but never came back to clean it up. A couple of other servers stepped over the mess, but nobody came back to clean it up. The manager brought back my sliders. He apologized for the first ones and offered to personally remake the wings. We declined. The manager left to find someone to clean the floor. Here comes our server with a tray of drinks. He slipped in the sour cream/ranch and almost fell. Drinks and ice spilled off the tray and on his front...he kept on going. Round two: The BBQ slider had two big hunks of pure, slimy fat on top. At least it was somewhat lukewarm this time. The meatball slider was warm and tasty. The burger was dry, even with mayo, and tasted like cardboard. Good thing those sliders were already being removed from the bill. I couldn't eat them. Not even with ranch.   It is interesting that the last time we had trouble with our order at this location was probably six to eight months ago. I tried the sliders for the first time, and was sent sliders with bun tops and bottoms that were half black. I mean not overdone, but jet black on the left half, normal color on the right half. On the top. In plain view. No attempt to even hide it. First, why would the cook even try to send it out looking like that? Second, why would the server even try to serve it like that? We spoke to the manager who had just taken over a few weeks prior. Good news. This place has been going downhill since a few months after it opened. Finally, it's going to get better we thought. We've been a few times since then, and it's usually underwhelming. We keep trying though.  Now, they've removed the calzone and the grilled cheese sandwich, which we're usually safe bets to order.  Back to tonight, though. I gave one star because our server was working hard. He was the only one. The kitchen was slow, failing, and just doesn't seem to care anymore. The manager was busy handling complaints (we weren't the only ones) and trying to help mop the floor. There were other servers, but the food was slow so they were mostly chatting or hiding in the back. None of them were smiling. And our check?? Of course when it arrived, those sliders were still on the bill. Now we know why the restaurant and bar were half empty on a football playoff Sunday afternoon. Probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"This is a my favorite place for wings and beer. It has a sports bar ambiance. Thee are TVs all around and playing different games. I believe every Tuesday they have wing specials, or at least they used. We ordered Ghost wings and asian garlic wings. Ghost wings were made up of ghost pepper sauce and was not just hot but very very hot....loved it. Fair warning, if you cant handle heat, then this one is not for you. Their next hot is Mango haberno which we had last time,  its spicy but not as much as Ghost wings. We also ordered Garlic bread and that was tasty too.  They have a wide variety of wing sauce selection. They have other items but we aleays had wings so cannot comment on others. Overall wings were very nice. I do recommend this place for some nice wings."}
{"text":"We were there last Friday. Normally good service and food but not on this visit. Friday night and one bartender. Had empty drinks all night. Messed up our food order and when I mentioned it to the server she said, \"oh\". Had to flag her down all night for service."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here with my mom after leaving a Cubs game early. Although the staff was a little slow (the looked understaffed) the drinks and food were delicious. They had tons of happy hour deals and drink specials depending on the day of the week. I got to try there homemade potato chips for free thanks to checking-in with Yelp and all the food we split was fantastic. I wish I was vacationing because my mother and I agreed we would be regulars at a place like this."}
{"text":"Amazing food super  fast my server was best never got empty drinks and was super busy but did not stop our server I don't remember her name but she was great will be back"}
{"text":"Literally writing this as I've waited 30 minutes for the waitress to come back so I can ask for my bill and get the hell out of here.  We were the first table here, accompanied by 2 other tables shortly after. Food took a little while, which doesn't bother me, but after the food was dropped off and the side of ranch came 5 minutes later (really?) The waitress was never seen again. I finally had to flag down the hostess to find her for me. What the deal was, I was too annoyed to ask, but I've realized this place is notorious for poor service. I used to love coming here, until they inserted the big bulky booths smack dab in the center of everything.    After today, I'm pretty sure my relationship with Native New Yorker just went from slim to non-existent.  As a waitress, I usually have sympathy and slightly more patience than most, but this place breaks all the customer service rules and THAT is a no no."}
{"text":"We've been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  It's a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are 'meh'.  We'll come again because it's a good spot for the kids, but we'll come expecting not great service."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here today John was so helpful with bringing all of our food and then Emily would check up on us as well and she brought us some drinks and Amber at the bar was so awesome she made my drink so good . I was so impressed with the pizza had whoever made it was awesome."}
{"text":"Ehhh the wings are definitely not as good as the wings at native in chandler. The waitress was slow as hell when there were only a few people there and the zucchini sucked."}
{"text":"Wth has happened here. First let me start with what I do like. Honey hot sauce. Still my favorite. The chocolate chip cookie dessert. My daughter liked it. I ordered a dozen honey hot. The fat on the wings made them inedible. I feel like I'm biting through gristle. It's a shame because I like the salt and pepper too. But someone needs to do some serious quality control here. Service! Excellent. Danielle is the second star."}
{"text":"From 2012 to 2016 the place has gone to pot. Service is so bad everytime I go i kick myself for going. Food is good if you get it, or get it right, or if they give you silverware without asking or napkins. From now on if I go to a native it will be to anyone but Brown rd. Very sad it was my favorite neighborhood bar and food, go to place."}
{"text":"This is a fall back location for Chicken Wings.   I have always liked this location but I am finding myself searching for other options recently.   Usually like Chicken Wings and Salads. Salads seem to be getting less enjoyable. And wings seem to be smothered in sauces lately.    It is not that I won't visit anymore.  There are two many locations in town not to go once in a while. But I am searching for a better go-to place for wings.."}
{"text":"Since my last visit I came back with family. This time I got the chicken Parmesan and I actually enjoyed it no sickness or anything afterwords my oldest wasn't a fan of the wings he said they kind of tasted like they were burned but I thought they were Ok. Overall much better this time around and the service was still great"}
{"text":"Renee has taken care of us many times. No matter the size of our party, she is always on it. Since we have moved away, we miss our nights out at Native, but they are a planned stop each time we are in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by today and Jessica was our lovely waitress. Our orders was taken promptly and was delivered shortly after. The pizza was cooked perfectly and the wings were crispy and had the right amount of sauce on them as they tend to run dry at other locations. Our drinks were refilled without having to ask; which is rare to see nowadays so def a plus! Definitely coming back to this location! :)"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened back up. I will give it a two stars since it started off really well. However after we placed our order it was like being back at the old native. I ordered wings and two arrived without any sauce. We asked for ranch for our salad and the waiter forgot. We were halfway done with our meal before receiving a refill. When we got the bill I was confused since when we sat down we were given a happy hour menu but did not receive happy hour prices. Waiter told us we probably did not understand the hostess correctly but we told him we were told it was happy hour. We just thought since they just opened they were running all day happy hour. Anywho I'll be making the drive to Ray Rd for Native. I had high hopes but it just wasn't there for me."}
{"text":"Great place to go eat and even watch a game. Love that I can take my kids into the atmosphere there and not have to worry about someone cussing up a storm. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this location so my friends could come over here instead of me driving to Tempe. Then a 20 minute wait for 2 people with 7 tables visibly empty... Food was good, service not so much (took 55 minutes to get 15 wings), the beer finally arrived after most of the food was gone, then they brought another and seemed confused since I didn't order a 2nd. I will try this location again after a while, till then I will continue driving to the Tempe location where I meet a group of 16 every other week and never have to wait this long."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Native locations before, and I've got to say: the Tempe location in particular is so DARK. Seriously, it makes it hard to read the menu and to see the faces of the people you're with. It doesn't feel as warm as the ones in Ahwatukee (to me, anyway), but it's clean, which is always important to me.  That said, you can't go wrong with the wings. I've had other items from the menu before (pizza, burgers, etc) and they're nothing exceptional. But if I'm in the mood for wings, Native is my go-to place. I just wish that they still provided moist towelettes for my saucy post-wing fingers...  Technically, I would give this particular location a 3.5, but half stars aren't allowed so I rounded up. For the record, I'd give the Ahwatukee locations 4 for better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been this native twice in the last year the first time the service was terrible they served part of our party then served other customers served another part of our party then served other customers, finally finished serving our party it was about 20 minutes between the first person getting their food and the last person getting their food in our party.  The second time the service was better but the food was only ok the hamburger I had was dry and over cooked"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I have problems. The first time I went there I ordered a pizza, halfway I stopped chewing cause I felt something in my food. It was a piece of white hard plastic. I told management and they gave me a gift card for less than what I had paid. I still gave them the benefit of the doubt and went there again, terrible service."}
{"text":"I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house.  I have been to various locations around the Valley and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere.  This location though is woefully inconsistent in both food quality and service.  Since this location has been open I have been disappointed that one week food quality is great but then the next time food is either under or over cooked.  Specifically the Chicken Wings, it's a roll of the dice wether your wings will be undercooked and slimy or overlooked and dry. The wait staff tells me this is one of the biggest complaints they get.  Unfortunately after years of complaints management can't seen to get it right.  Look elsewhere if you want good quality Chicken Wings (Wingstop #1, Buffalo Wild Wings #2) or any other Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"Love the fact that I can order honey hot naked. My ultimate favorite. Thank u thank u"}
{"text":"Draft beer wasn't real cold, appetizers were real good,  had the zucchini, mozzarella sticks, onion rings and potato skin thing, was hot and not real greasy. Had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and pretty good."}
{"text":"The Native is pretty good. Good beer selection though it is mostly dominated by domestic light beers. The wings are legit. Try the honey hot and if you're feeling a little crazy...get the suicide wings! They'll light you up!!!  Service is alright. Nothing too special here. They're a little expensive for what you get. For two of us at lunch, our bill was $32. Thats pretty steep for lunch."}
{"text":"The server was nice. However, I ordered a burger with only cheese and she brought a burger with everything on it. It took 30 minutes to bring our food and it wasn't busy. We asked for napkins and water and when she didn't return with them we found out that she forgot. Needless to say we will not revisit Native anytime soon"}
{"text":"Salad and wing night!!  I had a renewed enjoyment of Native New Yorker at this location.   Enjoyed a huge Cobb Salad and wings. Unlike some other locations I have visited, the winds were not drenched in sauce.  Came out hot and were a perfect match to my salad.   Read other reviews about the location. I would agree that it is not a shiny new location. The tables did have a stickiness to them that was not pleasant. But I think it as the surface of the table and not a cleanliness issue.   Waiter was attentive. Kept my drink filled.   The food was exactly what I was looking for at that moment."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of blue cheese, be sure to ask for ranch (and vice versa).  They will do their best to deliver the wrong sauce...every time!  This place is always busy but that isn't a reflection of the food but rather the desperate stomachs of San Tan Valley.  Service is slow/poor and management seems unconcerned and detached.  When/if more casual dining options pop up in the area, this place will be a ghost town unless they start focusing on better service and quality."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in AZ. A must visit when I arrive to visit friends because no one makes Strawberry Heat wings anywhere in CA. Any of the wings you order on the menu are certainly a win in my book but my love for the Strawberry Heat is like nothing else comparable to what is offered in CA. Not Wing Stop, not Wing Nuts, not nothin'!!!! Oh also had the calzone here and it is mighty good. Fresh out of the over crispness, the pocket stuffing is cheesy gooeyness in contrast to the fresh meats, & the sauce accompanied with it is great for dipping. Native New Yorker also has a separate bar for an adult setting & later at night they provide karaoke for fun drunk times. Family side also available with tons of TV's all around & sports throughout the day/night. You can't go wrong dining @Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"I'm always disappointed when we come here I don't know why we keep trying. Just get takeout. I paid early to be able to leave with my toddler if I need too. They took my money and never came back. No drinks ignored my request for napkins. Asked for a booth the host brought me to a table."}
{"text":"It's funny that I choose this place to be the first place I review. This is actually the place I had my first date with the guy I'm with now. We both ordered the Club sandwich and sat on the patio. It was hot that day, and I was very new to Phoenix, I actually wasn't living here yet. Anyway we sat on the patio and it was nice, a couple of drunk people (a man and a woman) started to get into it. He called her a horrible name and she got very upset. The manager came out very fast and handled it and then came to use and offered us a round on the house for the situation. HE DIDN'T have to do that but he did, and it was awesome. I have been a fan of this place ever since, I love this particular location it's always nice and lively and the food is always good. We have even gotten a few other people on the place. Oh and they serve one of the Best \"Sex On The Beaches\" I have ever had. So I mostly come here for drinks, but what's better than good drinks and good food with baseball on the TV? All in all I love this place, would give it a five star but the location on Bell is horrible so that effects how I rate them in general."}
{"text":"Great Bar, Great wings, super friendly bartender Kyle. Kyle was fast and made awesome drinks!  Such a great place to watch football and enjoys drinks and friends!  I would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was nothing worth the 2 hours spent here. For forbid you need a refill."}
{"text":"In a word: blah. Service was competent, but not much else. Food is standard fare (wings, apps, burgers, etc...) that is passable at best.  My companion and I shared a sampler and Asian chicken salad. The onion rings and wings were good, but the fried zucchini, potato skins, and salad were not even close. The table next to us had a pizza that looked pretty good. IF, and that's a big if, I go back, I'll probably try that. You can get much better food elsewhere"}
{"text":"They have great food definitely the wings!, I always go in and order Wings. My family and I went one day and went to go take a seat and nobody came and placed our order, how rude. Never again..."}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about this location. It seems all Native New Yorkers have a general lack of motivation: the waitresses take forever to come around, and they don't know much when they do. My husband and I are also regulars (as in, we go at least once a week, sometimes two nights in a row), and we are not treated any better! Same slow waitressing. I think it has to do with management in general.   I know NNYs are franchised, so maybe somewhere in their training there isn't enough about at least greeting the customer when they get a table, instead of walking by us for five minutes before finally jumping in and asking for our drink order. We also have to wait almost every time (not exaggerating, really) for them to come clean one of the booths so we can sit down- yet the waitresses don't seem busy and every table has sticky remnants and crumbs on them.   I often have to fight for my garlic bread which comes with the salad. I literally had to ask for a menu two different times so I could show the waiter the meal description.   The food is average- I don't like getting anything then what they're famous for: wings. I've tried the sandwiches and they often have dry bread. I've tried the pizza- cheap dough and not enough cheese or grease to really call it Native New York pizza. The chicken strippers are delicious though. I've just learned to stick with chicken from now on!  But the PRICES!!!! So tempting! This location has half off all drinks after 8:30, making a Tuesday night Wing Night less than $20, and I get at least 3 drinks, so does my husband! Getting a tall beer is cheaper than a soda.  Overall: great place to go with a bunch of friends if everyone wants to drink and not care about service!"}
{"text":"We love Native wings but not for Gilbert one.  Here they have poor service ever!!  We went in after 10 PM and no one come to us, may be they don't want to serve any customer for happy hour."}
{"text":"We had a great time. My husband and his sisters are in town for their dads memorial service. We still need to eat so we came here! Stephanie was busy but attentive and the food/drinks were tasty! The mom had two margaritas!"}
{"text":"Mike is the best GM ever, not afraid to hop behind the bar and help out when needed. Extremely attentive and the reason I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worst take out experience ever. Ordered strippers with an Asiago Parmesan dry rub got strippers with a hot sauce with Parma sprinkled on top. No celery with the entire pound. No blue cheese dressing. Tried to call. No answer on 4 attempts. Went back to the restaurant. The food that was given 2nd time was awful. There was half an inch of oil in the box. Nothing absorbent to rest the strippers on. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Native New Yorker. However, this location does not live up to the others sadly. The wings were good but the curly fries with cheese were barely edible. The cheese was watery and the fries were mussy somehow. They usually have the best fries! I highly recommend the Signal Butte location. This one just didn't live up to it. My mom was with me and said her sandwich was really good as usual but again, her fries were worse than mine. He fries didn't seem to even be cooked all the way but were still mushy which I don't even know how you accomplish. Service was good. Atmosphere is a little more open and \"lighter\" than the other locations which I really liked."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in years. The wings were like they had been cooked several times and were hard and disgusting. Our side salad came out after our food with no apology or anything. Getting refills on drinks never happened. My Dos XX was room temperature. Their kegs clearly are not working correctly or their glasses were so hot it made the beer not cold. Either way the beer was gross at room temp. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"The service is always okay, nothing extraordinary. The chicken wings always come out hot and fresh, and their ice cream cookie desert served on a hot cast iron is amazing."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for food, was cold, some food was soggy when it came out...  The food tastes great, I am sure it would be better if it were hot.  We will see how the desert is when we order it.  Good atmosphere, they need sun shades."}
{"text":"Really crappy food,I ordered my favorite pork slider, it come on dinner rolls, soggy rolls. Where are the buns. Just really went down hill. Wings were over salted and fried dry. This place is banned from my family and friends.  Service was good. Food sucks....Food still sucks, gave it a second shot. Nah I'd rather eat Mc Donald crappy food."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Native in a few years, and after today never again. Ordered a Reuben the meat was so tuff, had 3 bites couldn't eat it, server asked me if there was a problem thinking to myself no I always take 3 bites then push it away, manager came out and asked me what the problem was with my sandwich I told her it was to tough, long story short I get the check they charged me for a lunch I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"After recently visiting Native Grill & Wings for lunch I left a personal item behind and called to see if anyone found it. The waitress turned in my belonging and when I returned were gracious and checked my ID and description of the lost article. Very honest and accommodating personnel not to mention the fabulous wings! Thanks to the staff!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of natives wings but this location definitely let me down. Went to have dinner there last night with my boyfriend and son. They sat us at a dirty table and took over 15 minutes to even bring us a menu. I ordered 8 wings and they only brought 6 and to top it off, our waitress didn't even bring us our change back for our bill. Did not leave a tip and will not be going back to this location :( Wings tasted great though! lol"}
{"text":"Eating at this Native location was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  When we entered, we were greeted by a \"please wait to be seated\" sign, and so we waited for several minuted before anyone took notice of us. When we finally got to our seats, our server failed to offer us any menus, so we awkwardly waited until they came back to take our orders, at which point we asked to see a menu before ordering.  Admittedly, my next gripe is partially on us because we chose to go during karaoke night. The music was unbelievably loud, making conversation impossible. The songs people chose to sing were pretty offensive, with very explicit lyrics. (During one song, the patrons at a table near us moved themselves to the outside seating. Evidently we weren't the only ones offended by the music.) After the person running the karaoke confessed that some patrons were complaining about the music, the songs became slightly more family-friendly... for about 10 minutes. Honestly, if people want to sing X-rated Adam Sandler karaoke, that's their choice, I just wish I had known beforehand  that someone would be singing about sexual fetishes while I was trying to enjoy my appetizer.   Amidst all this, my friend my friend nudged me and pointed to the wall above our table. \"What is THAT?\" she asked. It was (I kid you not) a cockroach crawling along the wall. And at that point I lost my appetite completely.  Our server never came back to refill our drinks, and in fact we never saw them again until long after we were ready to leave. I honestly can't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sure, the food wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special either, and the overall experience has ensured that I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been at Native and I know I will be coming back.  Our server Michelle Shuck did an amazing job.  She was attentive  and efficient. She was a joy....what a bubbly personality!  We loved her!! Kudos to you for hiring her!"}
{"text":"They have the best wings. I've been other places, sure, their wings might be larger but they're all fat and sinew you just can't enjoy them. Here the wings are all meat and they have tons of flavors, and you can order one of each flavor if you'd like they don't care how many you order. we have been going here for years and the medium buffalo sauce is my favorite. Tuesday is the day to go to get cheaper buffalo wings. They give free refills on their sodas.  the staff and manager are nice people, and I always seem to see a friend there every time I go."}
{"text":"Food and service were great...hate that you can't seat yourself in the bar area I think it's ridiculous you have to wait for someone to seat you.  When the music started playing it was so loud you couldn't even carry on a conversation a little over the top.  Having some type of drink special or reverse happy hour would also be a plus."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3 times a week.  It's just like any other native, good wings and cold beer.  They have a patio with plenty of tv's.  If you're looking for something other than wings try the pizza!  I didn't believe in it until the other day - some of the best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"I adore this Native! The food is good (especially the cheese sticks), the drinks are reasonably priced (plus they have happy hour/reverse happy hour specials everyday), and there are at least a dozen tvs to watch games on. What really keeps me coming in is the bartenders! Mike, Yvette, and Camry are on point all day, everyday!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.   It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.   They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :("}
{"text":"I'm torn between 1 and 2 stars.  The service was decent.  It took them a while to refill our drinks but other than that, we had a good experience.  We got the nachos.  Maybe it's a east coast thing but it came with chili.  The chili wasn't bad but I was not expecting it with my nachos.  I swear the menu said cheese \"sauce\" but the cheese on their just looked like microwaved shredded cheese.  Very skimpy on the sour cream.  I'm comparing these nachos to Moe's (which closed down near the arena) ... yum, their \"liquid gold\" - now that's a cheese sauce!  We also ordered wings which were ok.  Not as good as Buffalo Wild Wings, IMO.  The salt and pepper flavor was quite tasty actually.  I dunno ... I might give this place one more try.  Our overall experience was \"meh, I've had better\" but seriously, I can't get over the nachos.  This place is obviously popular - they are all over town - so maybe we just didn't order the \"right thing\"."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times recently....and twice ordered the boneless wings. They are terrible. Not cooked recently, obviously sitting under a heat lamp because they are lukewarm and stale. I could only stomach one piece the second time i ordered them (hoping I would have a better expierience the second time around) because the sauce was soooo sugary and the breadding was so stale. Yuck.   I have also had the California Cluck which is a tiny piece of chicken on a huge bun.  If you like bread... Order this.   The only reason I will go here is because they have beer. And there is nowhere else to go in Laveen. But they don't have Kiltlifter on draft so this is a huge minus for me."}
{"text":"I'm new to this area and came into the establishment with my husband today. Our bartenders name was rachel and she made the experience worth coming back for. We went with her recommendations on what to order and everything was awesome! The hiring manager did a good job with this one. Fast service and a fun neighborhood environment. We will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Let me first say, I have never had anything here but wings and curly fries with cheese so I can't comment on anything else. The service is usually friendly, The fries and wings are the best bar food I have found. There is a large variety of sauces for the wings, and always lots of cheese on the fries! great bar food! the televisions always have the games on also which is a plus and you can always see several tv's from wherever you sit."}
{"text":"Meh food, and the worst service I have ever received at my life. We placed a simple order for wings--a whole hour and fifteen minutes later, we had not seen our wings, an explanation, or even our waiter. Eventually we were so sick of waiting that we went up to kitchen to find the waiter screwing around on his phone WITH THE WINGS SITTING NEXT TO HIM! I was absolutely blown away. He looked at us, and asked if we needed something, as if we were intruding on his private time. I just stared at him and then looked at the wings. Upon his eventual comprehension of the glare, we received a careless \"Sorry,\" and the batch of wings, reheated. Avoid this place like the plague, unless you're looking for the restaurant equivalent of the DMV."}
{"text":"Tried a pickup of some food other than pizza n wings... Philly Steak Sandwich and Club Sandwich, It was HORRIBLE looks and tastes like it was made yesterday. Old hard bread, old yesterday's bacon and fries that had been under the heater also since yesterday. $20 bucks now in the garbage can..and still hungry! Won't b back."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here a few days ago. I was really craving wings and this is one of my favorite places to get them. It was kind of late (11PM ) So we called the place to see if they would be open when we got there. They said they don't close the kitchen until 11:45 so we drove over there excited. We arrive at the place and they turned us away! It was 11:20 pm we checked. The door says open till midnight so if youre going here just know that they close earlier than they let on."}
{"text":"If I can give this place 0 stars, I would!  This was my first time here and the service was probably one of the worst I've ever encountered. The place wasn't even busy and everything took long to come, waiting for our server to take our order, waiting for the food and waiting for the check.   As we waited for our food to come, my sister noticed her fork was crusty. I checked mines and it was a bit crusty as well. GROSS.   We ordered appetizers and it came AFTER our meals. Our meals weren't even hot, its like it was sitting out.  Since we waited so long for the food we'd think it would be nice and hot but when it came the chicken wings, burger and fries were cold to the touch.   Coming here was a big mistake! I really wish I had checked yelp reviews before I came here. Would've saved me from this terrible place."}
{"text":"Ill start with the good. The bartenders are very friendly and make you feel welcome as most wing/bar joints will. Now on to the bad. This is a wing joint. Their wings are on the low end of the totem pole when it comes to size, flavor, and freshness. Ive been in 3 times and the first time my wings were literally cold. Some were luke warm. Not crispy, not freshly cooked, and 8 of the 12 wings were tiny. The other 2 visits were a little better but when it boils down to it Beef o Bradys and Bdubs both kill this place.  Its a nice layout, is clean, and has mostly friendly staff but unfortunately its not a hospital so the food has to be good as well to get more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"I was recently there for a quick business meeting with a potential business partner. We both ordered from the lunch menu specials. She had the Caesar salad,which looked delicious and fresh. She seemed to enjoy it. I ordered the lettuce wraps.  now I'm not one to judge a book by its cover. I have a wide variety pallet. But the wraps were not good at all. It had a Cole slaw type salad inside that was extremely creamy and tasteless. I do not suggest it. However, my unsweet tea was delicious, and the service was great.   This review is strictly on this experience only, I am a fan of their wings and will continue to dine."}
{"text":"WING NIGHT ~ Wahoo!!!   I did not used to be much of a wing fan, however that has changed over the last couple years. Now I very much enjoy good wings. Native New Yorker has a great Salt and Pepper dry rub that I am obsessed with. The wings are good sized, crispy, flavorful and not greasy (or) to messy. There is a hint of garlic on the Salt and Pepper wings that makes them just that much better. If you go for Tuesday night .35 cent wings just be prepared to wait for a table, it gets a little crazy trying to find a place to sit. But for the price and the quality it is worth it!   (Their Medium sauce is good, it has a little kick but it does not burn your mouth. So if you like sauce on your wings but don't like to sweat then go with the medium.)"}
{"text":"The quality certainly isn't there for the price. The service was slow and food wasn't as good as  it used to be. Way over priced. Too many better places to waste our time here."}
{"text":"Had the WORST customer service EVER by ALEXIS she came back after 45 minutes to see if I needed something to drink we had no spoons after we ordered dessert no napkins too I ordered Cobb salad not enough dressing SHE NEVER CAME back I ate it dry for the rest of the salad and worst of all she was training another girl but John the manager took care of the bill the food Excellent !!!!!! Thank you John Alexis needs MORE TRAINING !!!!! food is excellent just don't have ALEXIS serve You"}
{"text":"Gag gag GAG!!!  I am staying at the Residence Inn in Glendale and they offer room service that comes from Native New Yorker. I ordered the BBQ chicken burger with steak fries, and a chocolate cheesecake.   Disgusting.  It took about 35 minutes for the food to arrive (not bad). The food that I received was awful. The menu says (I have it in front of me lol):  \"Topped with our BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, signature onion strings and leaf lettuce.\" The chicken tasted pretty good. The lettuce was wilted, the onions were greasy and gross, and there was NOOOO cheese!! Cheese is everything! GAH!   Cheesecake....with whipped cream?? The whipped cream was ALL melted when it was delivered! EW. OBVIOUSLY it was going to melt on the way to the hotel, right? So why put it on there? The menu says NOTHING about whipped cream, either. The chocolate tasted like plain ol Hersey's.   Definitely will not be eating there again, room service or dine in."}
{"text":"Unfortunately tonight the service was extremely slow and not very good. It took forever to get food. The hamburger sliders patties were over cooked and had a burnt taste. The fries were not very crispy. There were not very many customers and it took over an hour for us to get food and our check."}
{"text":"This location was very dirty (I.e. The table was sticky, the floor had trash all over the place). The server was also slow, was unfamiliar with the menu, and didn't even know the beer specials."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave bad reviews, but I had to for this one. I hate when people complain at restaurants, because I think people perceive it as you are trying to get something for free and that's not the case. I just wanted my wings done RIGHT! That's it!! But that was too much for the obviously over exhausted and non-attentive Katherine, who was our server.  Seriously Katherine, find a new job. I asked for 4 of my wings extra crispy and LIGHT SAUCE. I seriously doubt you put in either request because when I received the first batch of 4, they were slathered in sauce and even the dry rub wings I ordered were soft. So, NOT extra crispy. But, I didn't want to be THAT customer, so I gave the 2 that were drenched the most to my family and then ordered 2 more from her - light sauce, extra crispy. When she brought them, again, heavily coated in sauce and skin light and soft as can be :/ this time I made a little comment about there being a lot of sauce and she had the nerve to have a debate with me about how my wings were in light sauce. You can check my bank statements, I go to Native once, maybe twice, A WEEK! The other locations I go to never seem to have a problem with light sauce or extra crispy. I know what both look like, so trying to convince me that my wings were \"light sauce\" was showing me you really don't care. I know she didn't cook them, but here is my issue: I used to be a server for several years and I would have NEVER brought that plate of wings out because I pay attention to what my customers order and if it's not right, that's a reflection on me. It's not like it was busy either, there were 3 total tables inside and she was not the only server! I gave her the required 15% tip, because I'm not the type of person who would not, but usually you get 30% from me for being just an average server, so 15% is horrible service. But never will she get a dime from me or my family or my friends again because she single handedly made me never want to go to that location again. I'll stick to the locations of the ones that make me feel like they appreciate my business and pay attention to my simple requests."}
{"text":"Ugg hortible service. Not helpful or smiley. Food was subpar. Flimsy lettuce and bland. Patio has no speakers or misters...but hey they have heaters..what the heck?"}
{"text":"A horrible representation of the native New Yorker franchise, this location is filthy dirty. We sat in the lounge for a beer and some wings and I immediately noticed the sticky/dirty table, I then noticed the shades were covered with sauce and slime of every type, the staff was engaged with conversations with \"regulars\" and failed to pay any type of decent attention to other guests. My cousin ordered wings which were ok but the service was impersonal and un attentive, this is the worst looking and ran native New Yorker I have been to. The decor is horrible and rivals places on reality tv that need a major makeover, I would guess if corporate came here they would shut it down. This is a sad snap shot of a good company."}
{"text":"I enjoy the ambiance the quality televisions, and sports bar feel. The food is par.  But I hate when I grab a menu and it's filthy. I find this common at a lot of sports bars. Maybe native can rise above this disgusting oversight"}
{"text":"Oh yeah.. now I remember why I haven't been back here... F*cking Shitty Service. Promptly greeted by the young lady at the front desk who invited us to sit in the lounge, not where I wanted to sit, but OK.. whatever.. sat in the lounge for about 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged by a server.. hey.. be right back.. another 10 minutes.. got our drink order.. hey.. be right back.. another 10 takes order from tables who had arrived after us.. several trips to an from kitchen.. the place isn't packed.. it's steady, but not packed.. I won't be back.. waiting now on wings to go order.. yeah I'll get those in a few minutes after your main order so they will be ready for you at the right time.. nope.. deer in the headlights look when I asked..  won't be back.."}
{"text":"My favorites are their chicken wings and Pizza, great experience and food. Would go back again. Recommended to try out their food."}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times.   -Service has always been good.   -Food has always been fresh. -Atmosphere is typical sports bar style.  -Price is reasonable (about $15 per person with drink) and happy hour drinks are fair.    We've had the wings, pizza, calzones, California cluck, kids meals... all are good."}
{"text":"This place is alright if you hungry. Other than that wings are small and dry. The loaded fries are alright. This food is the same kind of food one can find at a pub."}
{"text":"The place was pretty much empty we ordered and got are food 45 minutes later our Wings were COLD and are Waiter was preoccupied talking to a group of woman, Forgot ranch after we ask, Pizza was somewhat good a bit too greasy. On are way in and on are way out we saw several waiters and waitresses smoking cigarettes outside the door"}
{"text":"Staying a couple days in Phoenix late day at the job exhausted tired looking forward to nothing but that hotel king size bed. Need something quick but was not looking for fast food,  hamburger and fries was not going to cut it the local hotel assistant suggested a local place called native grill and wings said the pizza was great and they would deliver until 9 o'clock received the food was good. Kinda greasy but tasty.  Salad not so good.   But hit the spot.    The lettuce was kind of Wilty not very crisp maybe the delivery guy had it on top of the pizza box for delivery.  Pizza had the perfect amount of Grease very tasty perfect for one person"}
{"text":"Since my last review we have ventured to this place a couple other times and lately we have sat at the bar every time and the service has been much better. Not so slow anymore! And the bar staff is fun and inviting! Good job making things better!! I love the honey hott wings!!"}
{"text":"If you want great service see Byron!  Outstanding service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the suicide wings are delicious! Ice cold beers on tap. surprisingly the shrimp is pretty good too the cocktail sauce is spicy just the way I like it. It will definitely clear out your sinuses."}
{"text":"The food here is awful, if your going for drinks, great idea! Wings are nothing special but it is hard to find a good wing being super picky, the pizza was so bland, no taste, super thin crust with burnt toppings! Do not waste your money on the food! Did like how they had every game but overall I would not recommend it and will not be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Understaffed frequently. Average bar food. This is not a go-to place. Prepare for a wait at all the usual times. Avoid the bar unless you want poor service and a negative experience. Hopefully they one day attempt to step up to the plate. :("}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant again since it is close to work.  Service still sucks. If you go for lunch make sure you have well over an hour as the staff is in no hurry to serve you.  If they even show up to your table to begin with."}
{"text":"I love coming in Friday nights! Reverse Happy Hour 9:30-close, Karaoke Night, and delish 19 flavored chicken wings. As usual I would order Lemon Pepper traditional wings, Tator Tots, and a few drinks of Jack/Coke.  Thank you for the fun times! I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Pardon my french, but Native New Yorker might just have the best goddamned F'ing wings in the valley  There, I said it.  As a former Chicagoan (and long time soldier in the \"Chicago pizza is the best and NY pizza shouldn't even be called pizza\" war) (and longtime hater of the Mets, Yankees, and Giants), you don't know how much it PAINS me to say something positive about anything NY, but have to admit, NNY's wings have achieved perfection.  Not too big, not too small, a nice crisp to them with just the right amount of sauce . . . the hot wings were just hot enough to get a sweat going without override the taste . . . the Pineapple Teriyaki, the Oriental Garlic, and BBQ Hot wings were very good too . . .    Damn you, Native New Yorker!  The servers have been great, Tony especially.  My $2 Coronas came at the right pace (yep, $2 Corona all day every day), he went out of his way to ask how each item was, and he gave me some great recommendations.  One was I asked how their Beef On Kummelweck sandwich was (it's marked as an NNY signature item), and he was indifferent to it.  He said he hadn't heard much good or bad about it one way or the other.  He then went say the Torpedo and the Steak Bacon Cheese are his favorites, and that he gets great feedback on them  Ok, he'd been great up to that point, so I gave the Steak Bacon Cheese a try, and it was very good.  I'd order that again but would ask for sauteed onions/mushrooms/peppers on it.  Add some giardenia, and that would be money in the bank  The atmosphere in the bar area is great, nice and dark, lots of brick, with tons of big flatscreens, and Tony was a vocal ambassador of the place.  He was great, and does service to the phrase \"Trust your waiter\".   My only complaint so far is based on their take out catering.  Our office brought in the Penne Pasta.  It was Penne noodles, a reeeeeeally watery tomato \"sauce\", barely there meat and barely there bits of dead green peppers and onions, with a congealed cheese topping.  To top it off, the whole thing was under baked, not a hint that it had ever been in an oven  There was still a ton of the pasta left over the next day . . . (I was at work, it was still free, I was hungry, what's a brotha supposed to do?) . . . and it was slightly better the next day because it'd gone from watery to gloopy after a good nuking.  Disappointing, yes, but I'm not going to judge them too hard based on catering trays    Anyways, I have a feeling that after a handful more visits, I'm going to have to bump NNY to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I dont know why this place is packed every night, but it is. Not a fan of their wings. Always too long of a wait for what its worth. Two stars because its close to home."}
{"text":"Service is slow, but food is alright. Not many options beyond burgers and wings."}
{"text":"Native is a perfect corner restaurant for those of us that live in the Foothills and don't want to go far from home.  Staff is always very friendly and food is good. Love sitting at the bar, as the atmosphere always makes you feel like you are among friends!"}
{"text":"Great location and staff is friendly.  Food is okay. Low star rating for crappy service and wait time, particularly on to go!    Wait time to place an order on the phone can be up to five minutes...picking up the food can be worse!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Though there was a little confusion involving the drinks and when appetizers are ment to be servered *Before the actual main food* we understood since it was the 2nd day opening."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place for a while because I saw no need. My husband and I have been going here every week for the last 3 years since his transfer. I have friends in the junction so we went to the Signal Butte restaurant once and that was enough. I never have bad service here on Power Rd. I'm thinking it's because the lady manager that works at night is on top of everything. The woman is like the energizer bunny. She watches the bartender. She watches the kitchen crew. She watches the servers. Nothing gets past her. I say this because I think that's why everything is always maybe not perfect but close. I have read some of the negative reviews on this location and wonder why a few have bad experiences here because in probably 100 visits here we have never had one. It makes me wonder if they are that person that has a bad experience before they walk through the door going in. Or the other possibility  is that they are so rude and/or obnoxious that it is impossible to give them good service. If you treat some one like they are lower than you its hard for them to be nice. Some people can't or won't do that because they think they are better, and they are wrong. In addition to what I have already mentioned those complainers should also take into consideration how busy a place is. If it crowded when you go in expect a delay or leave. Don't blame the staff cause it's busy or write a bad review."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine wanted to get together today for lunch. I suggested Native since my husband and I had such a good time their last weekend. We all agreed but they all live in Apache Junction so we went to the one on baseline and signal butte. Big mistake. The service was terrible. the food was edible but not like the other place on Power Rd. None of my friends were impressed either.  I had to listen to them complain all the way taking them home since it was my turn to drive. I should have just drove to Power like I wanted to. I will give the food a passing grade. The service also a passing grade but a D while it's passing you don't want one. On the way out I was overheard talking to one of the girls about  the restaurant on Power being better and a gentleman piped in to our conversation and informed me the two restaurants were owned by the same people. The help doesn't act like they were trained the same. Slow on power, don't care on signal butte.I will be back to a Native in the future. While their are many things I didn't care for at the price it's worth some of the problems."}
{"text":"Disgusting. From the dirty,  sticky table that me and my two kids were sat at, to the menu covered with something wet and sticky on the last two pages that kept me from opening it,  to the sorry excuse for fish and chips that was just a soggy pile of grease and batter,  to the wings that seemed to be fried with dirty oil and gristle. We weren't given silverware or napkins,  even after our food arrived and if the server had bothered to check on our table AT ALL after our food came,  I could have told him how gross everything was.  I had to track a server down to request some silverware so that I could eat.   I took my kids there because it's one of the few sit down options in the area, but do yourself a favor,  go sit down at the far superior Taco Bell or Burger King that are nearby and spend your money on edible food. One of the biggest wastes of $30 I've ever spent in my life.  Never again.   DON'T GO HERE!"}
{"text":"As a wing fan, this place is the spot! They have an abundance of flavor options and- what's awesome for wings - is that you can get whatever mix/order you want. There's no minimum amount of flavors per order, so you can get 1 of each flavor if you want! It's different for the boneless wings and chicken tenders, but who doesn't love chicken on the bone?! They also have great weekday specials and reasonable prices otherwise. Check them out!"}
{"text":"FOUND HAIR in my food. Asked to take it back and the manager said it probably fell from my hair. It was not my hair color at all! Went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper at all so I had to use paper towels. Manager was a short fat guy and didn't even discount my meal for the hair! My daughters food was so cold I had to take it back twice!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Manager was such a jerk and did not care about out horrible service!!! DONT COME HERE the other native grill I USUALLY go to is GREAT! thanks for a horrible dinner JERKS IM NEVER COMING BACK"}
{"text":"So gross. So, so gross. I wasn't expecting fine dining, but seriously?!   There's nothing \"New York\" about this shit hole, unless you count the dirty prints on the wall.  Don't waste you're time or your money."}
{"text":"This place used to have the best wings in town.  NO longer.  They were barely warm, and bland tasting. The beer was flat and warm - what are these people thinking???  Wait staff was totally indifferent.  Don't bother coming here, unless you are looking to purge your colon."}
{"text":"This place is crazy. The waiter started to fight a customer and chase him down the street screaming that the cops were coming. Honestly so embracing. But other than that Adrianna was a great server lol!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Cold wings, water pretending to be a \"margarita\" and poor service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"In order to have - as their jingle claims - MORE than just great wings, don't you first need to HAVE great wings? Absolutely awful food, terrible service, and a gross dirty restaurant.   And keeping an eye on me, my wife, and my two little girls to make sure we're not watching some stupid MMA thing, otherwise you'll be back to collect your cover charge??? Man, eff all that nonsense. Never again. Ever."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was not a good experience. The house salad was disappointing, the sliders were not flavorful and their textures were bad. To top it off, our pizza took a full hour to come out - at least they have about a dozen tvs to watch while you wait. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Native is lucky to even get one star, they hire rude snot nosed kids for their staff."}
{"text":"My sister and me went Sunday and the renovations seems nice. I miss the privacy from the old look but its still a nice restaurant. We ordered a combo for 21 , when my tater tots came out they were all cold in the middle but I was not mad because I'm a cook and knew the cooks still needed to tweak some stuff. Manager was nice enough to take it off. I will be coming back because everything else was super delicious."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews but I live in Buckeye and come here almost weekly because of my pleasant experiences so far. I'm not giving it a 5 star only because 5 would be 100% best place ever and those are far and few in between. Love this place and will continue to come for a long time. My kids love it too!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service! We were there about 2 hours before closing and there were three other small parties besides our big party and it took 15 mins to get welcomed 20 mins to get our drinks and 1 hours to get two pizzas and 24 wings. I understand we were a party of 9 but I mean when the restraunt is almost empty common you can do way better. Our server was never to be seen when we needed her and it was just not a good experience. I will definately travel the extra 15 minutes to the next nearest location on 99th they are definately a better place!"}
{"text":"Listen, I've never eaten in at this particular establishment so when I read all the low star reviews I'm in disbelief. Maybe there's something I'm missing. But I've ordered take out from them plenty of times and the service (Ashley is WONDERFUL!) and food has always been on point. They put up with my crazy requests, and do so with a smile. (I want my wings extra crispy and I don't want to sacrifice any sauce for it, I'm the worst kind of hot wing patron) Get the BBQ HOT flavor, because it'll change your life. They also just changed their pizza recipe! It's hand tossed and about a thousand times better, for those that didn't get a good impression on it the first time around. One star off because they're a little too pricey for what you get, but I'll still be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"One star is generous - and it's only because yelp forces me to give this place one. Please spend your money somewhere else, anywhere else.  Remember the pizza McDonald's sold in the 90's? Better than this. Remember that time you stepped on gum? It probably tasted better than this. Or was at least warmer than every meal I've ever eaten from Native Grill in Surprise, AZ. For whatever reason, it always smells like sewage in there so I avoided eating in and ordered for pick up this time around. Went in to pick it up and stood there awkwardly waiting for almost ten minutes without seeing a single employee. A young woman finally came out, made eye contact, looked at a different customer, then walked back into the kitchen. Insert eye roll here. The same employee came out again and this time I made sure to get her attention. She seemed really annoyed that I was making her work...at her work. Nasty tone and attitude the whole time. Finally got my food. I ordered a large pizza, and six pack of wings, and a dessert for my wife and I to share. The pizza box looked a little small but I shrugged it off and thought maybe it was just me.     Got home and what I got is shown in pictures. I opened the box and immediately had to snap a photo. And it was cold. Not just not hot, but cold. But we were starving and tired and it was about to storm, so forget driving all the way back there (but with that service, I doubt anything would be done). This was the worst pizza I've ever had hands down. The sauce tasted like a middle school cafeteria's tomato sauce and you could tell by the cheese the pizza was old. Oh, and it's definitely not the large size I paid for. They burnt the cookie on the dessert. The wings were also cold.    Just avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! Good value. Good food. Good service. Thank you Amber, you we're great. We love the app, thanks for helping us out, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I am updating my earlier review. The manager, Kevin, was in touch and invited me to return and give it another try, and I did.  I was clearly there on a bad day. I came back and had a delicious meal of Strippers (salt and pepper are the best) and had more typical good service. Kevin is very nice, too. Thanks for restoring your integrity with me. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my god!! This place is gross! Floors dirty 4 or 5 tables not bussed bathroom stalls had no toilet covers there was toilet paper wads on floor and when she finally decides to seat us she really thought sitting us next to one of the dirty tables!! I am shocked and disgusted! We left cuz ain't no way in hell I'm eating at that dump!!"}
{"text":"I visit every Nascar race weekend. Good food. Good drinks. When I sit at the bar I get great service. Def a good option that isn't as crowded near the mall."}
{"text":"We came to the brand new Native New Yorker as we were happy to hear they were back in Laveen. Came on a Friday night with the family. The restaurant was fairly busy and were attended by a very nice waitress who kept asking about out food throughout the night. There had been a mixup with our order that took longer than expected, but our waitress as well as the restaurant manager were on top of it and made sure we got our food. Food was great as well as service. So happy to have this establishment back."}
{"text":"It was good. I like it better than buffalo wild wings. Tried the ghost pepper sauce, not that spicy for me. Not much else to say about this place honestly."}
{"text":"Worst wings I have ever had! Tastes like a cheap, microwave brand. No wonder the food came so fast. Kids didn't even like their grilled cheese. And the service is awful! I was the only customer in the place and yet my server didn't ask me how everything was. Next time, I will choose quality over convenience and drive to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Woohoo - I did it!  1lb of the ghost pepper strippers down and done.  (Last time I'm doing that though!!!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely gross. Changed all the booth seating to tables. Now you get the privilege of watching everyone chew their food. Floors and tables were dirty. Didn't even stay to eat. Had to leave."}
{"text":"The food here was average to below average. Meals came out cold and two in our party never were able to eat because between the manager and the kitchen they couldn't figure out how to serve a hot dinner. If you want details read the rest below. I'm warning you..... It's long....  We came to this restaurant on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. The parking was full so after a long day of OHV riding we decided to stop here for dinner. We waited about 10-15 minutes. Our waitress,Amy, was quick to take our drink order and appetizers. There were six adults and we each ordered various foods off the menu. We asked the waitress questions about the menu and she said she was new and didn't know a lot about the menu. Specifically I asked about a salad dressings. She had no idea. She didn't even offer to ask someone who knew. I ordered a margarita pizza and she had no idea what it was so I showed her the big picture of it on the menu.  Another member of our group was vegetarian and from another country and he wanted a vegetarian salad. She told him to get a wedge salad with bacon all over it. She had no idea what vegetarian meant.  The rest of us never noticed what he ordered and he was very upset to get a salad with bacon all over it. Our waitress really was trying. She just hadn't been trained properly in my opinion. The appetizers we ordered, potato skins and pulled pork queso dip with tortilla chips, came out relatively fast. They were so so, but we were all very hungry and ate them.  Unfortunately, our dinners took well over a half hour or more after we finished our appetizers. When we got our food, two in our party ordered buffalo wings with fries. The wings were refrigerator cold so they sent them back. Our waitress told the manager about it and about ten minutes later Brooke stopped by our table and told us that she was sorry the food was cold, but that they would be out in 4 minutes. By the time she came to our table the rest of us were about finished with our meal. At any rate 20 minutes later after the rest of us were finished eating there was still no food for the two that sent there order back. At that point the waitress was hard to find. She was embarrassed and there was nothing she could do. When she did surface we asked her about the food the manager said would be out in 4 minutes. Again she apologized and got the manager again. Brooke, the manager said there was some confusion in the kitchen and that each of the cooks thought the other made the two dinners. So Brooke then said we are making them again. We told her that we just didn't want the dinners anymore and that we were ready to go. We asked our waitress for our check and she disappeared for another 10 minutes. We couldn't even pay our check to go get dinner for the two that hadn't eaten some place else. The manager made us wait while the cooks made our order to go and the waitress was no where to be found. Two of us finally paid and left we were just discussed by the whole ordeal.  I even asked Brooke if she new there was a problem why didn't she communicate that to the kitchen or make sure the issue was resolved. She just said I'm sorry, but with the demander of I could care less. She really doesn't have the skills to handle let alone manage a restaurant. She missed the whole point. We were staying an hour away and by the time they would be able to eat it would be cold. Two of us left and the other lady in our party took the dinners. In the car she tried the food and the fries were cold and soggy and so were the buffalo wings. We ended up leaving at 9:20 pm while the other two groups were still waiting on their checks. My husband never did eat with the exception of a few potato skins. This was actually one of the worst experiences we have ever had at any restaurant. The owner really needs to know how their restaurant is being operated."}
{"text":"Had pizza.  Pretty bland.  Crust had not a lot of flavor.  Not enough sauce.  No comparison to a great place like Oregano's or NYPD Pizza.  I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Went there earlier this week and wasn't too impressed. They had a decent selection of beer, and a fairly eclectic menu, but the item I ordered (the chicken strippers) were nowhere near as good as I expected. For $10 for chicken \"strips\" I expect a decent amount of food. I'm not expecting a feast, but it's sauced chicken... it's not that pricey.   I had maybe a 4-5 small pieces of chicken (that's a half pound? Seems light but I didn't bring my scale) and a small amount of fries. The fries were seasoned well and I really enjoyed them, but I could have been given a larger portion. If the fries were doubled I'd have been 'content' but it still would have been a small meal.   My father ordered a sandwich and really enjoyed it, and was barely able to finish. He was talking it up as he ate, and I was getting a little jealous. I apparently made the wrong choice.  I'll give them another chance, but I certainly won't be ordering their strippers again. I'll go with a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5 because of Amber who is always so nice whenever I come in to this location. She is always making sure we have everything we need and loves to talk to us. Food is good customer service is great."}
{"text":"Native Grill here in Buckeye, Az. Is a little overpriced in my opinion. Last time I ordered 20 wings, plain, and it cost me almost $30! That's outrageous!! That's over $1.00 and change per wing! That's about the only thing I've ordered so far and to date. I don't think I'll be going there again or ordering from them again as everything is overpriced!"}
{"text":"I'd give NO star but that's not possible. Worst meal almost ever... Then to make matters worse we had even worse service. Food was served to tables that were seated after us before we were served. It took 20 minutes for a cold appeteaser to be served.  The food was awful hot food was served cold. Soup was not eatable. Requested a manager come to table but after 20 minute wait they never came to the table. Finally got our bill which was processed quickly the only good part of the entire meal. This wasn't my 1st negative experience here but will be my last. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I decided to try Native today after we found a disgusting hair in our food at Bootys Wings (Surprise) today! The girl seated my husband & I. After we waited 15mins NO SERVICE EVER! All the other nearby tables were getting waited on except ours...SO WE LEFT! HORRIBLE SERVICE! UNFRIENDLY HOSTESS!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. We walked in and weren't greeted, even though two employees saw us walk in and just continued talking. There conversation was much more important, so we were seated after they were finally done. Our waitress was quick to take our order and our food came out quite quickly..   We had 18 cold wings and a side of fried zucchini and French fries. The zucchini was good, but the fries tasted stale and were partially warm. The wings I'm guessing were just microwaved since that's what it looked like. Our waitress took three years ( about 10 minutes )  to bring us the check and almost quite as long to pick it up -_-  the restaurant wasn't even busy so I don't know what she was doing..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, and both times I left a happy customer. They have perfected the crisp on their chicken wings and I usually eat wayyyy to many of these because of that.   My last visit I waited longer then I did the first time, and the chicken wings weren't very hot when it came out. I also waited for quite some time for the server to come to the table once I was seated.. but overall...great food."}
{"text":"We like the food but our concerned about the \"ToGo\" area where you pick up your food. Very dingy an dirty. There is no sign on the  to go door. Inside this closet of a room, what was strange was there was a bucket of celery sitting behind the counter in water.  Paint is peeling and floor and baseboards are dirty.   The bar staff is ok but can be slow at times especially at night."}
{"text":"This is what a wing and burger joint is supposed to be. I had the native burger and it was fantastic. The service wasn't great but not so bad that I would take more than one star. Wish I had found this place sooner on this trip."}
{"text":"Excellent fast service and food! Waiter was on point! Defiantly stopping by again when in the area!"}
{"text":"This particular trip to Native in Laveen was to try their Friday night fish fry. Being that there were three Wisconsinites in this party, the bar was set high and expectations would be difficult to meet. This is a place known for pizza, wings, and cold beer...but we ventured off the beaten path and tried something new.   I have to start with the service - AMAZING! And while our server was outstanding, the fish fell short. It was left in the fryer too long, so we sent one and a half pieces back to try again. Only one piece came out and it was over breaded, but edible once we pulled all the fish out.  This was unacceptable in our server's opinion so she went to her manager immediately. The manager came over and wasn't too sure what to say, although the bill spoke the words he couldn't - $20 off the total for the poor food. (Don't worry, we didn't tip off the new total...we took care of our server because she took care of us!)  Lesson learned - don't eat fish at a pizza and wing spot. Stick to what's good!  They get my five stars and my continued business because of the service and the fact that they made things right."}
{"text":"This place is amazing josh was a delight to have taking care of us will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Eh. Lackluster and overpriced food.  Their wings are pretty wimpy. The service is either just ok or really bad. Their mixed drinks on special feature cheap well liquor. I'm not asking for Grey Goose, but the vodka tasted like it came from a plastic bottle. I'm a big house salad eater, and theirs are only served with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on top. How bout some onions and croutons?!  But seriously,  the food isn't what it used to be at other locations ~10 years ago or so. We don't come in anymore because it's always an expensive way to just leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited this past Friday for lunch because I love their honey hots wings. Service was prompt as usual but the wings were disappointing. The SIZE of the wings were minuscule- probably 1/2 their normal size-.. I mentioned it to the female manager who acknowledged that they were working with the supplier but she did nothing else...no comps, no discount etc.... I find that unacceptable."}
{"text":"Remember when Native used to actually give you normal sized and sauced wings? Me too! This isn't the location to get that though.   First we wait close to 15 minutes for our server to even greet us. She was busy \"refilling ice\" in the back and clearly didn't know we were here.   It took about another 10 minutes get waters....by now we're hangry. We ordered two half pounds of strippers with different sauces, house salads and a kids meal.   Fast forward about 10 minutes, the food arrives. I have never seen more pathetic chicken strips in my life. My daughters wings looked great but her sauce tasted like maple syrup. Oh the food was also room temperature.   Our server checked on us once as she breezed by us to another table. Manager never came over either.   Super disappointing service and food quality for the amount of money spent."}
{"text":"I received such great customer service on a busy Saturday night! I decided to give this location a visit since its pretty new! We arrived around 7:30 and it was poppin!   The layout of the restaurant is weird. You have to see it. The food was great and it came out rather quickly. We ordered our Native usual. 18 Parmesan asiago wings, 2 bacon cheeseburgers and 2 house salads. These house salads were the bombbbbbb! So crispy and fresh!  Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and always checked up on us. This will be my native spot from now on!  *download the native app and receive a free order of wings!"}
{"text":"I love native and was glad to see there was one in the area when we were on the hunt for something to eat.   It was Saturday around 10pm and we were starving. We walked on in and two my left I saw some metal thing blocking the entrance to the dining room. We stood there and walked up to the little window and was told to take a seat in the bar area.  We picked a sticky booth and sat down. Our server came around pretty quickly he and took our drink orders. The bar was not too busy and there were other customers dining in as well.   Our server who I felt bad for seemed to be the only one working. This guy was literally running around serving about 26927363 other tables.   We ordered:  One large sausage and pepperoni pizza  One medium half pound of strippers  15 pack wings (Asiago Parmesan, spicy buffalo ranch, bbq hot)   Our pizza came out right away and we were excited to dig in. There were three of us and we had only been given two plates. We did see our server busy helping other people so we could not get his attention. We ended up waving another guy down and he brought us over an extra plate minutes later.   Our wings came out right after and ummmm yeah... the wings...  The wings were... to say the least not the native wings that I am used to. Both orders of the dry rub wings were gross and not what I have eaten. These wings had no flavor at all and they literally just sprinkled the dry rub spices on top of some plain wings.  The bbq hot were also very dry and i want to say these wings had to have been reheated.   Service wasn't so great and we sat around waiting for ranch and other things. The server did try his best though to come around and see what we needed. He was so busy.   The bathroom was being cleaned and the worker cleaning it was not having a goodnight... He rudely answered us that it had to be mopped when asking him if the bathroom was ok to use...   Definitely skip this location if you can."}
{"text":"RJ was our server Saturday night and he did an amazing job! He was friendly, attentive, and would constantly check up on us! It was a pretty slow night and I believe at one point we were the only ones dining there. Better for us! The wings are what always bring me in!! The Asiago Parmesan ones are to die for!!!! We also had the sampler and it was pretty good! I always have a good experience at native!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Native New Yorkers and this one is by far the best. We eat here pretty regularly and get the same thing, so the only difference is the servers and management. Every server here is awesome, especially Ashley. It starts with the management, Kari is incredible and always makes sure you have a wonderful experience. On a side note, the blueberry margarita $5 special was spectacular."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Menu's were sticky, you know the sound that plastic makes when stuck together. Tables not clean. What's the restaurant grade on this place? Waiter didn't bring napkins until we were just about done with the meal. Hostess attitude was mediocre at best. Going to cross this one off of my list."}
{"text":"I ordered a standard cheeseburger, medium-rare, and I'm not quite sure how hard it is to mess that up, but it happened. First off the lettuce consisted of the spine of the lettuce, which isn't appetising in itself. Second, the burger soaks the bun, table, plate, whatever it comes in contact with. I asked if they use butter and neither my sever or manager really knew anything.  It also was rare. I have had other locations completely cook the burger so much that it was dry. I've now learned never to order a cheeseburger from Native. (Which is dissapointing because the first time I ordered one, not from this location, it was delicious) but after many failed attempts I am no longer going to consider this place for one. I get a better tasting burger from In-N-Out.   I was thankfully comped for my dissapointing disaster. But the manager that came to my table really had no idea about how the food is prepped. The serving of French fries is less than desirable, and if you order a meager side of them, it's like 4$ which is an outcry. My friends always order wings and have never complained, but I don't eat those. Maybe I will try a salad......if I ever decide to go back. Personally, I do not enjoy playing Russian Roulette with my meal choices."}
{"text":"Generally the service here is subpar but tonight we were so glad to meet Mia! She was the best server ever! We will definitely request her next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is always slow and waiters not friendly.  Service seems to be better on bar side.  Have to clean dirty dishes off our table ourselves"}
{"text":"I just left this place... Barf! I can't believe I have to put 1 star down! It was that awful! The wings were 79¢ each and they were cold! Umm cold chicken wings, gross! I had a wedge sald and loaded fries with burnt bacon like so burnt it smelled Burt and made the whole dish taste burnt! WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Horrific.. Wait staff flirt and hang on young customers while they ignore older professional types. We waited  20 minutes till someone said hello and took a drink order. Some of the foulest language ever heard at a restaurant. Definitely not a decent place. Hit Oregano's across the street"}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings. It's right around the corner from me so I've been going to this location for a while. Two main points from my visit last night ... First, they've redesigned the place recently, and I'm not much of a fan. It's now just a big rooms with tables and chairs. There are a few TVs on each wall, but that's it. All open space and very little decoration. It feels like a cafeteria more than a sports bar or grill or whatever, and not very welcoming. Second, had a dozen wings. On the plus side they're bigger than before so you're getting more quantity. But it may be at the expense of quality. Previously when you order wings with a wet sauce they would be smothered. The wings last night had very little sauce and were pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about their wings. They aren't that good and most of them are sorta dry.   I think they cook them too long or something. I've tried this place 3 times and still very inconsistent with all the wings when you eat them   Cool that you can get all these different flavors but wish the meat would be more moist.   Service wasn't bad at all so atleast they have that.   Also they have the UFC fight be they charge a admission which is kind of stupid IMO. And you have to spend a certain amount during the fight. Wtf is that, this place is cheap as hell  I won't be back and I go to a real bar to watch the fights without having to pay."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there a few weeks ago horrible customer service! Sat in bar area for 10min and place was not even packed. Waiter did not acknowledge us or say \" I will be with you in a moment \" I had to go call another waitress from the other side and she came over and told the waitress on bar side that we been waiting. She then comes over and gives us menus with attitude and says will be with you shortly. At that point just got up walked out told manager we were trying to order before happy hour was over and how waitress was rude. Use to be my favorite place for wings but not anymore."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at 1pm there was a TOTAL of 3 tables there and I seen 3 different servers and the manager walking around. We were sat and waited 10 mins before deciding to leave because a server hadn't come to the table (even though one kept looking at us from the kitchen) disappointed because the native grill on Brown is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We LOVED this place! It's very rare my husband and I agree on a wing place! And this place finally won the honor! We were seated quickly and our server LIZ was fantastic! She helped me find a drink I would like because I don't drink caffeine! We ordered wings salad and a pizza and hands down the BEST pizza I've ever had! Id say best first impression! We will be coming back! Again and again."}
{"text":"Been come to Native New Yorker (old name) since the early 80's. They were always famous for their cheap and excellent  wings. With franchising cost is always more important to the business. I still go quite often and continue to but have switched to strippers.  Highly recommend this place. Happy hour is good. Service is usually good."}
{"text":"Wings aint got no meat tho!!"}
{"text":"We went in dor the wings and a salad. The medium wings were good but nothing wonderful and the salad was pretty bad having only iceberg lettuce and a slice of sad tomato. On the other hand the beer was good and cold!"}
{"text":"Worst Native in the state in my opinion. Stay as far away from here as you can. Where to start.  The restaurant tonight, is colder then it is outside the family could barely stand the temperature.  Next we order an appetizer and asked with no tomatoes and the waitress acknowledge the order. We get it with tomatoes of course and she walks away. Then she returns and offers to take the appetizer to have the tomatoes removed. Not remade but removed.   Next we order 3 Native stripper platters with fries. NOTE HERE DO ORDER JALAPNONONONO SAUCE!!! It's just green chili sauce on soggy wings.  All 3 orders were soggy, cold, and under sauced. We asked for extra sauce and it was brought out but they were the wrong sauces. Two of the orders were ate the Jalapeño was not touched. The waitress came and took the plate still intact and never asked why the food wasn't eaten. WHAT!!! Are you kidding me lady?! Anyway was a bad night no bill adjustments and I won't ever be back.   My advice is to find another local spot when you are in Buckeye!"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting this Native New Yorker for years and we have never been so disrespected as we were today. We sat down with our family which included a 10 year old on the bar area at 3:15 on a Sunday. The server came up to us and let us know that kids had to sit in the dining room.  We let her know that there was another kid in the bar. She told us it was the bartenders son. It was not the bartenders shift. He was there sitting as a patron with friends.  We are not the type to complain or leave a restaurant, but we are done with Native New Yorker for now. We understand rules, but they should apply to everyone. Even the bartenders and all employees. You can contact me at emily.liscom@gmail.com if you need any more info about this situation."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I have been to different natives and never experienced this. There was 3 adults and 1 child in our party. All 3 of us ordered salads, we got there at 730pm and didn't leave till 9pm because the service was so slow. They were not very busy so I don't get why they were so slow. Never will go to this native again."}
{"text":"Service  was good but order a strawberry Daqari that tasted terrible  sent it back.  I'm sorry but for a place that specializes in wings I felt like I just went to Walmart and bought Tyson wings and heated them  up in the microwave . I won't be eating  here ever again."}
{"text":"When you stop in, be sure to ask for Michael. Aside from his professional and courteous service, he knows how to explain exactly what you can expect from their variety of flavors here. I opted for a pound of \"strippers\", half ghost pepper, half Asian garlic. Despite the warnings on the ghost pepper, I went for it, and was not disappointed!! They are HOT, but still retain a good flavor. The Asian garlic was just as described,\"They taste like Chinese food\", and that's exactly what my tastebuds told me. Restaurant is clean and seems to be well ran, with tons of flat screens, and even outdoor seating. Thanks again Michael! Next time I'm in Phoenix, AZ, I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"For starters I need to preface this review with the fact that there was a sports tv show filming when I arrived so the place was full.   Let's start with service or let's say lack of service. Disappointing to say the least.   I ordered wings and so did my wife. Very average like everything else.   Felt like a dinning room at an old age home with TVs.   All in all, not going back, but there are a lot of good reviews on this place, so maybe I just was unfortunate."}
{"text":"I was not happy about my wings but sendiSuper shout out to the manager ERIC ! He made me fresh wings gave me 25 % off and a free beer! I'm happy now!!!! Love this place ! Come one come all! This is true customer service!"}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE BUT......  We've been going to this location for the past couple of years off and on for UFC in the bar mostly, as it's very close to our house.  Truthfully the only thing I've ever really enjoyed food wise, was the chicken. (pizza is decent). Last Saturday night was no exception. There were 5 of us but my gf is a vegetarian, so she always orders the veggie platter (only choice). Normally it comes with some pretty nice whole mushrooms, cucumbers, carrots and what not... Decent. On Saturday we learned they had eliminated the quality veggies and changed it to a veggie and cheese platter with a small Dixie cup of artificial squeeze cheese!  Carrots, broccoli, giant tomato chunks and ez squeeze? Are you serious guys? This cheese is disgusting. To call this a veggie & CHEESE platter is a bad joke.  Chicken was very good as usual but to see such corner cutting on something so simple was ridiculous.    Luckily the GM Alex Campbell was making his way around to all the tables. I let him know how disappointed I was because I felt bad for my gf. Alex was very understanding & apologetic and offered to go back and get some mushrooms for us, stating they no longer carry cucumbers. He was gone about 15 minutes and we started to wonder where he went. He then walked over to us with a plate full of fresh whole mushrooms, explaining they had all recently been chopped and he had to run to the store to get them, as there was no way he was coming back empty handed ! He actually stopped what he was doing and drove to the store to make us happy.  Now that's a great manager guys, Alex was pleasant to speak with and took care of business. Not every situation calls for a drive, but this type of dedication is what the service industry is missing these days and I can't say enough for this fella. Also I should mention our waiter Shane did a nice job taking care of us during the UFC fights.  We had a fun evening and the chicken was great. Only gave 3 stars because corporate could do a much better job with the rest of the food as well as the draft beer selection. Can't be a one trick pony & expect to do well around here guys.  Thank god for UFC, good chicken, and great managers."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The staff is friendly and helpful but not in the way. The wings are awesome and 49cents on Sunday's for the game. They have tv's everywhere so it's easy to find the game or event you want to see."}
{"text":"When it was Native New Yorker (prior name): We l-o-v-e their Reuben sandwich. The last two visits, the service was good; friendly and timely. Reubens are the bomb. lol Enough meat for two sammies!  I tried their Reuben after the name change, and I had to complain as I could see the bread; sad amount of meat compared to the ones I've had prior. :("}
{"text":"Our service has always been amazing, the food has always been delicious but today was the best experience thus far! It's my husband's birthday so our friends called up to Native to have him surprised. The staff was accommodating and loved surprising my husband as much as I did.  We went there to watch the football games and we were totally involved in the games. Our waitress realized that and was very attentive without us losing much focus for our games. Thank you, Ariana!!! Thank you Native and your staff! Always great food and a great staff!!!"}
{"text":"They were really slow . We were waiting for wings for about 1 hoir and they we burnt. I'm supprised our surver even gave it to us. We waited to be seated for about 30 mins and there was NO like AT ALL! Our surver lost our card and blamed it on us. I or NO hearing this beeping noise it turns out the nous was a grub hub order going off for about 30 mins. There was this couple as well they were not happy at all... While that sound was going off the couple was sitting there and waiting to be seated. After about 30 mins of waiting they left.. Next football season I am findong somewhere else to go"}
{"text":"I guess Im lucky? We live near NNY so we eat there a few times a month. First off they now have sweet tea, thank you. The pizza is above average and they will bring you several different wing sauces if you ask. Josh was our waiter last time and he was amazing. I will be asking for him when I return. Can't complain, it's been good."}
{"text":"The wings were great and our server was very attentive. The manager even checked on us after hearing it was our first time having Native wings. The fries were great, but they need to give you more. The restaurant could use some updating with the decor. They had plenty of big screen TV's. Overall, we were happy and definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was neither surprised nor sorry to learn that they've closed.  They had the gall to blame the minimum wage!  Try managing your business.  Gruff attitudes, slow service and lousy food aren't down to the employees, they're down to lousy managers!  A pet peeve: order, wait, and wait, and then, when it arrives, it's cold!  Then blame the kitchen for not telling you it was ready.  I had to offer to pay to get a refill on water. If this location was so bad, I'm not likely to try any of those that are left."}
{"text":"We just stopped in, our first visit since the remodel. Our food was prompt and very fresh, the wings were good and the place was as clean as could be. We were very happy with our service. Lots of sports on TV without a loud, draining experience like most sports bars."}
{"text":"This is one of our normal haunts for lunch when we're out running errands on a Saturday.  We always eat in the bar area to avoid the children.  The atmosphere in the bar area is dark and cozy with lots of TV screens to watch your favorite sports teams.  They have a variety of seating options, the bar, high-top tables, booths, and an outdoor patio.  The food is consistently good and they have a great selection of beer, including Guinness.  I've tried a variety of menu items and have never had a bad meal.  I love the Apple Walnut salad that includes pecans and strawberries as well.  My husband likes the Torpedo and Calzone.  The wait staff (Darby, Heather, and James) are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I used to come here for karaoke on the bar side, but today I went with my family, and sat on the restaurant side. We got there at 2:59pm, place only had a couple other families, so it wasn't too loud or crowded. The waitress was quick to introduce and get our drink orders. She even recommended the lunch special-knowing that it lasted until 3pm-and saved us $10 from our bill by doing so! Awesome experience. Clean, waited on, and had a good time with my 8 year old. Plus their actually really affordable!"}
{"text":"Quite possible the worst service in the valley. The staff was more into watching the football game than taking care of their customers. It took almost 2 hours to have lunch. And the restaurant was maybe 1/3 full. Don't go on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place has somewhat redeemed itself. Waitress could be a little friendlier, but I was sat promptly and the timing of food was actually good today. I had the Cobb salad (substituted the bleu cheese with cheddar), but the blend of ice berg lettuce, avocado, bits of boiled eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and ranch dressing was pretty yummy... only thing I would change is to add some dark greens (like spinach) in there please!! 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"OK I've been back several times because my boyfriend likes this place.  I have changed my mind completely since my last review. Love the wings now, they always come out perfect.  Mike the bartender is a great guy.  Also the cookie skillet is sooooo amazing!  I will definitely be back again probably Friday, lol."}
{"text":"Great service from beginning to end very friendly. Loaded tatter tots where awesome. The hostess sat us quickly and server was right at our table great experience over all"}
{"text":"Cat was extremely accommodating, very efficient and attentive. She went above and beyond. Thanks Cat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! FELICIA IS AWESOME! best server I've ever had! She was attentive, funny and knowledgeable! The food is great and it's the perfect spot for this football season! oh and their wings are awesome! I will most definitely be returning here and I'll be asking to sit in Felicia's section too!"}
{"text":"Best fish fry, $12 well spent! They only serve it on Friday's because that's when they get fish in so you know it's fresh. It is the biggest piece of haddock I've seen fried, almost hangs off the plate. Very filling and the fries are seasoned well too, yum! :)   My fiancé always gets the wings and every wet flavor is really good. We also love there pizza and burgers.  You have to try the hangover burger, my fav!"}
{"text":"Great service from Adrianna. Just came in to watch the game, but she made me feel welcome, never had an empty glass."}
{"text":"For my first trip it was meh.. I felt the staff was worried more about the end of their shifts then actually working.. I waited for my beer when only four customers are seated at the bar... slightly annoying but things happen, a woman brought me my drink as it sat. I ordered the potato chips they were cold and soggy not what I was hoping for. The burger was excellent and everyone has bad nights. I would give them another shot in hopes of the service being better. The bar seems like it has potential."}
{"text":"Stopped for a drink while waiting for a delayed flight into Phoenix Gateway Airport. The boss says there's a location in Marana. Sports bar decor with lots of screens. NCAA March Madness. Separate bar area from the dining area as well as patio dining. Supposedly the first place in AZ to serve wings. Had to try a few. Honey Hot, Honey BBQ and Spicy Honey Mustard as well as a Buffalo Chicken Nacho platter. No local brews on tap, kinda industrial.  Quintessentially Phoenix. Decently busy with lots of families on an early Friday evening. Evolving the name from Native New Yorker to Native Grill and Wings. Not sure of the reason why. Maybe dropping the New York part of the name is good?"}
{"text":"The staff here is the best. They do a great job of making you feel welcome, especially the bartender Kate.  Riley is a lot of fun as well,  always looking to share a laugh.   Very relaxed atmosphere with above average bar food."}
{"text":"Julie was probably the best part of this experience. She was the super duper friendly bartender chatting me up and explaining all the specials and items on the menu. Nothing has really changed since they changed the name, but at least they are still giving free entrees on your birthday.  Oh wait..they claim to have new super crunchy fries now, but I would say super salty is a better description.  Not crunchy either. The philly at 8.99 was decent, it had mozzarella cheese and the menu said ribeye..but not quite convinced. The big excitement for me was a fly landing on half my sandwich for over the two second fly limit. They were nice and re - made the other half. Go for Julie and tip her well...she deserves it."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my kids, sister and her boyfriend only because Zipps was packed. Right off the bat you can tell this is not a new Native or a very nice one but we wanted to eat. First noticeable thing was the smell. I am actually not sure how to explain it but it sort of smelled like cat urine when you walked in the front door. The entrance is not very welcoming at all, and sort of leads you down a hallway where they seat you. We were seated at a stand alone table, preffered a booth but you can't always get what you want. It was just a wide open room with tables, a bunch of TV's. Waitress came out and took order. It became obvious this was not a traditional Native Ny'er but was previously called something else and was in the process of being changed over. I think they were struggling with an identity crisis as this place is simply not up to par with most natives we have been too ( like the one on Gilbert and Germann) and even the one in Dobson Ranch is nicer than this one. We ordered wings for the kids and us adults all got fish n chips. wings came out and could not believe how small they were. I will call them micro wings. Service was slow. The Fish and Chips actually took 20 or 25 minutes. I expressed a bit of concern with the server on how long food was taking. It was finally delivered. Fries were a little soggy but fish good. They took a whopping 10% off the order for the delay.   This location has a long way to go before I will eat here again.. With so many other Natives and sports bars close by no reason to come to this one."}
{"text":"Wow, another amazing experience at Native! I'm used to the good food, as I've been coming here since I was a kid. Now that I'm over 21, I love the happy hour, where i get great deals on food and drink.  The real highlight of my night was my server, Eli. He was extremely attentive to my needs. I am allergic to dairy, but Eli helped me find something to suit my palate and taste. I enjoyed uninterrupted conversation with my friend, while still receiving prompt food and beverage service. Eli knew exactly when I needed something, and demonstrated as such by always appearing right as I realized I needed soemthing.  At some point, I lost my card. Eli mobilized the Native Team to find it, and within minutes, someone found it! I thought I was in love with Native before, but now, I have a new reason to visit: the service. Native needs more servers like Eli! I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Stop in and see Ashley the bartender! She is awesome and will make your night amazing!!"}
{"text":"2 stars because of their lack of knowledge about food allergies. They have a gluten free menu that is filled with gluten ingredients.  You can't call anything gluten free if you fry everything all together! Pretty much an insult to those with allergies."}
{"text":"Native was the Spot about a decade ago. Food & service was always spot on until they got new ownership. Quality of food went down as well as the service. Every time I went back it was always the same bad service with either being overcharged for something, not getting the right order, food being lukewarm or not tasting any good. Really miss what this place used to be & won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ten of us came here for a work lunch on 9/19/17. We had a great server and good food. I ordered the philly steak which was the best one since moving out west (been here since '95). I don't think anyone was disappointed. The salads looked really good. Next time I will try the greek pita salad. Some of us shared the chocolate chip skillet cookie. It was good, but I've had better. The manager even came out to see how everything was. Looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for karaoke on and off for the last 8 years... always fun to see some of the same people singing.  I love the outdoor patio.. it's huge and provides relief from the music to chat.  Also a separate area for people not singing.  The honey hot wings are the best."}
{"text":"ordered food to go last night. the wings were amazing but when we went to have desert, our pizza cookie was pathetic.  we were so disappointed"}
{"text":"I was going to go to a competitor's restaurant but decided to try this location instead because it's closer to my house. I've been happy with the Native brand in the past so what did I have to lose? Very disappointed! The hostess was courteous and asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or the dining area. Being that it was Monday Night Football and I just wanted to relax, I opted for the dining room. The dining area only had about 7 tables seated. I prefer booth seating but had to sit in the corner because the other available booths hadn't been bussed. I originally chalked it up to bad timing. The wings were as to be expected. The beer, the same. My server was attentive at first but once I received my order it took too long for a drink refill and even longer to get my check. During the course of my meal I observed a lot of slow service and tables not being bussed. The only employee that seemed to care about working was the hostess (slender with glasses). The table next to me was served by an older slender female waitress. Once that table left, she didn't seem to want anything to do with it. The table sat unbussed and she couldn't even pick up the check even though she meandered by multiple times. My waiter eventually bussed the table, piecemeal. Once he finally came to check on me and I had asked for the check, he was very quick respond.  I know this location was remodeled relatively recently due to a previous fire (I believe) but I was very disappointed by the layout and decor as well. I felt like I was in a buffet restaurant that threw up a few large screen TVs. To me it seems like this location relies on the brand name and doesn't seem to care about putting forth the effort to be a quality restaurant. There's a lot of competition out there!"}
{"text":"OK changing my review. This was the sixth time and everything has worked out the wings are ehh but the atmosphere is great some of the servers are horrible but there are a few that are good."}
{"text":"Grew up going to all the Native chains. Visited here 9/27/16 .... first and foremost the pricing is outrageous! It's been awhile since I was here. A dozen wings is $12+ !What happened to the steak AND curly fries! BOTH gone?! All wings come out on one plate so if you have multiple flavors your wings end up with dry rub and sauces mixed together.  You guys used to bring out napkins, plates and a plate of ranch before the food even came. This is no longer and what a bummer to have to wait for the server to go get ranch while my food gets cold. Overall, over priced for mediocre food. Hate to compare to wingstop but I definitely won't be runnning back to this Native ......"}
{"text":"Great wings, three different styles and a myriad of different sauces and flavors.  Food comes out quickly, even if it's busy and a rather complicated order when our son's baseball team comes by for after tournament festivities.  They have a great beer selection, plenty of TVs to watch whatever event(s) are going on."}
{"text":"Gargle. Ahem. \"This place was terrrrrriiiibbbbblllleeee.\"   I have to completely agree with the other reviewers that myself and my family were severely disappointed with the food, price, and service* at this establishment. My son has been begging me to try this place so we decided to grab some lunch there today,  around noon. Native New Yorker was actually pretty empty for a Saturday at lunch time and since it's still a fairly new restaurant that surprised me.  After we were seated we got our drinks and menu's accordingly and started to browse. Our waitress was attentive and very friendly so that started things off right and put us at ease. When it came time for us to order is when everything started to go horribly, horribly wrong. My son ordered the build your own calzone, I was trying to order the pot pie. And the waitress had this uneasy look on her face and she said \"Are you sure that's what you want?\" \"Are you REALLY sure?\" I said \"Is there something you want to tell me?\" So, she proceeds to tell me that the pot pie isn't made fresh and she really encouraged me to change my mind. Than my husband tried to order the full rack of ribs and the waitress flat out said he couldn't have it. The new menu's apparently haven't arrived yet and it's technically no longer on the menu. How hard would it be to strike it out? Or to let us know it's not available as you're giving us our menus? Not very.   After that disappointment and awkwardness we had to take another five minutes to look over the menu. I ended up ordering the native stripper platter which is chicken strippers with your choice of flavor ( I chose suicide and honey bbq) with coleslaw and steak fries. My son was able to keep his calzone order and my husband ordered a personal pizza with sausage, bacon and pepperoni. We also opted to order an appetizer, the chicken bacon ranch flat bread. To their credit we all enjoyed the app it was a little over board on the cheese but good. For six dollars we each had three decent sized slices.   We didn't have to wait long on our food and it all LOOKED good, honestly we couldn't wait to eat it. My son didn't like his calzone because it was too doughy for him. I tasted it and it was cooked through completely but there was definitely more bread than innards. And, when I say the ratio was off-it was off...my steak fries were not well seasoned and just lifeless on my plate. My suicide strippers were not hot and my chicken was rubbery. Overall, my plate was overcooked and just very bland. My husband's pizza was so greasy he had to blot it and the crust was mushy and he had one and half pieces and just slid it away from him.   At the end of the meal our waitress brought us boxes and she seemed to intentionally overlook the fact that our plates were still full. Than came the bill...after tip it was a whopping $50 ....the only thing we got worth eating was about $6 so...we won't be going back. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because they had TV's everywhere all playing different sports which was awesome. Also, the flat bread app was good...  * The waitress was bummed out about everything that happened and it bummed us out."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed in this weekend's visit. I've eaten at NNY for quite a few years, and after an afternoon of furniture shopping, and surrounded by the bit \"Mall\" restaurants, I was pleased to see NNY, so my wife and I went in. We sat ourselves and a waitress came by a few minutes later to see if we had been helped.   She didn't know what beer they had on draft, odd, since half of what you sell is probably beer, and when my wife asked a question about a mixed drink she wasn't sure. I ordered the House Calzone, sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, mozzarella, and marinara sauce. My wife ordered the apple walnut salad with chicken on top and the dressing on the side.  The waitress came by to see if we wanted another drink. The blue drink my wife ordered was too sweet for her to drink another, so the waitress suggested the green drink on the opposite page. (East and West Coast, but I can't recall which was which.) The green one has sweet and sour mix in it, which gives my wife indigestion when it's the main component of something like a margarita, so she asked the waitress how much sweet and sour was in there. She didn't know, and headed off to the bar to find out.  The manager showed up with the food shortly after that and we asked her. She said they could leave the sweet and sour out, so my wife said that would be fine. She asked if there was any dressing, as it was supposed to be on the side. The kitchen had tossed it in with the salad. It was a very light vinaigrette, so she was okay with it. The manager left to put in the drink order and my wife noticed that her salad was missing chicken. She's watching me eat my calzone, attempting to get the attention of the waitress. She finally came over and threw the cooks under the bus: \"I put the order in right, they messed it up.\" She went to get the chicken. And my wife watched me eat.  For a pizza and wings place, the calzone was marginal. It didn't seem to have very much in it. I didn't detect any ricotta cheese, but was surprised by a lot of diced green peppers, which are supposed to go in the veggie calzone. Not my favorite, but I ate them. While my wife watched. Eventually, her green drink came, as did a plate of sliced chicken breasts, which appeared to be straight from the microwave. Although they appeared to have grill marks, it didn't taste like they had been anywhere near a grill. My wife said it tasted like boiled chicken, unseasoned, and totally unpleasant on the salad. We go to Oregano's a lot, and their chicken marinade complements the flavor of the salad. This seemed like an afterthought.  Then manager was very gracious about the whole thing. She took my wife's salad off the bill, as well as one of my beers.  I might go back if we're in that area in a few months, just to see if it's improved. If so, I'll probably stick to the wings."}
{"text":"The service was good.  The waitress was nice and pleasent.  However the wings came out wrong.  After they brought us the correct wings they where then cold.  This happened with 2 of our orders of wings."}
{"text":"So....my knock on this native has always been service.  Lets call food 3 stars and service 1 lonely star, if you are lucky enough to be waited on.  Was hopeful when new ownership came in, but another frustrating experience and I am officially over it.  Grabbing Long Wongs to go from now on."}
{"text":"Decided to go and get dessert from Native after having dinner at a different restaurant. I was craving a cookie sundae with a scoop of ice cream on it. After getting the Nrned Y'er Cookie, I should have spent my money at Fry's and made my own. I received 2 large scoops of ice cream, which turned into milk because the bowl is so hot, and when i dug in to get that first scoop, it took me 10 scoops to find any cookie. Worst part about it is that when we did get the cookie, it was RAW!  If the service was great, the atmosphere was rocking, then I would look past it, but it certainly wasn't. I will not return to this NNY, I will try others and hope that it is just the ownership of this location that allows such mediocrity and not the name!"}
{"text":"Came into Native tonight and got served by Zachary. It was pretty busy, as all of their Friday's usually seem to be, but I was very much so taken care of. Zach greeted me with an inviting smile and introduced himself. I could instantly tell how much he enjoyed his job. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it came out in good time with how many people were there. I come mostly for the team they have here and the obvious connection they have to each other and the customers. Always a good time. Thanks to the handful that keeps this place going."}
{"text":"Very generic, bland food. Service was very slow. The kids in our group got restless after an hour of waiting for their food. The kitchen manager got annoyed that the kids sat at an empty booth. Overall, an unpleasant dining experience and I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"OK OK I'm still on my health kick but I'm sure this will pass.... For this review  keep in mind this restaurant is a chain. Normally I don't care for chains because they put in countless hours to deliver the same average experience at each and every location, this restaurant is no different. Every Native New Yorker location is pretty much the same! .    Here is my review - First off there is nothing New York about this place other than the name. If you are going to call yourself Native New Yorker, be a New Yorker or at least give me some good old New York attitude. If your not going to give that East Coat attitude to people  then at least give us East Coast tastes.   There was three of us. My friend John V. My wife Carol and me.  John V got the Torpedo. My wife Carol got a  Extreme Cheese Burger. Both enjoyed their meal and ate everything on their plate. No left over or dogie bags for either of them. In addition everything was served promptly.  I ordered healthy. I got a Chicken Wrap. It was huge, It was kind like a salad. It had grilled chunks of chicken sitting on large lettuce leafs with chopped cabbage, & corn. Kind of like an Asian slaw with dressing. It was simply fantastic.  FOOD: Delicious food that is always consistent. PRICE: Decent prices. SERVICE: Our server was extremely pleasant, but we never did get his name. In fact the manager also stopped by and ask how our food was and he didn't introduce himself. AMBIANCE:  Typical sports bar atmosphere, lots of TVs all around the place.  It is a huge place where there is a bar area and the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables. CONCLUSION: Typical sports bar that  RETURN FACTOR: Definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst calzone ever put together by a restaurant. The thing looked nothing like a calzone on my plate - there were large slits in the dough (which didn't help) because most of the fillings inside were undercooked. Those fillings were raw veggies and partially cooked pepperoni. The mozzarella was semi-melted, but the ricotta lay limp at the bottom of the doughy mess. There also was alot of green spices on the outside of the calzone and that usually indicates a place that doesn't know how to make this dish. Hey, they make a mean one in New York, so it was worth a try. Beer specials were pretty decent for the game with $3 bottles and large Coors Lights, but food was inedible and I was reduced to picking through calzone and most parts were unsalvageable. Got caught up in a new football friend and beer or else this would have been returned. LOts of TV's, but way too many 49er fans for a NY bar. Place was packed, but my guess is even on a slow night the calzone would still rank right at the bottom of the pile."}
{"text":"Once again, I give it another chance, this time take out. Pizza may have been the worst I've ever had here or anywhere. Ordered extra wing sauce which I paid for and it was not included. Ordered Bleu cheese dressing and got Ranch. No attention to detail, and food even more sub-par than than I remember."}
{"text":"Came in with my family, allen was our server and was on top of everything! Such a good server! He knew what he was doing and seemed to care a lot about our experience. Very genuine guy. one of the best servers I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a zero but the server was not that bad. We went in yesterday for quick lunch and ordered the pizza wing and salad special. It was horrible! I think we had 3 slices of pizza and it was unbearable to even eat. Once we paid for the bill the manager told us sorry and the pizzas are actually frozen and gave me a 5$ coupon for the next time we come in. LOL there wont be a next time and I hope other people save their money and stomachs in the future. She said that she couldn't take off the pizza because we got it at a discount. The salad was also disgusting. Overall I am very dissatisfied with my experience there and would never recommend anyone to go to that location. Good luck Native! I dont think it will be too long before you close with food like that."}
{"text":"there are some bars/restaurants in tempe, and, i suppose phoenix as well, that just smell funky. Long Wong's was like that, for example. it's just an \"old building\" smell mixed with leaky pipes, i'm not really sure.   this place has that smell. for some places, that smell is acceptable and sometimes even a welcome reminder of the many, many good times you've had there. this place's smell is not friendly reminder of anything.  maybe i came on a bad night - it was sunday and it is summer after all - but this place was pretty dismal. but, i give them stars for serving food past 10, when everywhere else in universe was closing at 9 or 10 (the Ho Ho, across the street and my first choice, had a weird private party going on, which is how we got stuck with the new yorker).  they have a full menu and they serve til 2 a.m., which is a nice last ditch, back pocket choice. but i warn you if you're not drunk, which we weren't- it's not very good. the mozerella sticks came out warm on the outside, cold in the middle (when we very nicely told the server this he looked at us like we were lying, and if we weren't pulling his leg, seemed confused as to what he was supposed to do about it), and the sliders were the driest meat and oldest buns ever. my vodka cranberry came out in a large drinking glass that was ALL cran (that's my pet peeve, it's like \"i have to drink all this juice/cola/clb soda just to get my barely shot of boooze? lame\"). on my second drink order, i asked for a smaller glass, and explained i just wanted less cran in the drink, not a weaker drink. the glass that came out was comical -basically a large shot glass for say, washing apple shots, etc. - and still way, way too red, even for that tiny glass. i began to suspect  i was on a hidden televvision program of some sort, but just dropped it, because by then i had already stomached what i could of our greasy meal and given up on getting anything wortwhile out of this place.  unless you're a die hard fan that can't get your small town home team game any other way, i wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"This location is super nice and understanding. I forgot to tell something on my order and then took it back and fixed it and we so nice about it the food here was so good and I couldn't complain my waiter Kayla was so nice and on of the other employees Zack was so nice to change my order I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting for this Native to reopen for months now and what a disappointment once we finally went back. We ordered pizza and wings and they brought out our pizza and told us our wings would be right out. After being told our wings would be right out 5 times, told there was only one cook on a Sunday morning, watching the manager goof off with the staff and 20 mins later, we told the server we didn't want them anymore because we were already done with our lunch. The manager was a total joke and did not make the situation better by any means. Server was good but it didn't make up for us leaving still hungry. Not a good way to get your guests back!!"}
{"text":"Once again, great service, awesome food to your liking. The store manager came to our table to assure pur servuce was satisfying.   Once again awesome service.  Our waitress Nikki was beyond awesome.  A regular in our household.  Highy recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Beer is always cold and the staff is friendly and fast! Try the buffalo dip, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. Very friendly and helpful. Love the app too for great deals!"}
{"text":"So this is a tiny native, same species and decent happy hour. Service is hit or miss, bartenders pour very tiny shots, so you are better off with the beer. Wings are very good, and they have a lot of flavors, love the chili lime  and regular hot. Thumbs up for potato skins, thumbs down on the mozzarella sticks and zucchini. Overall a decent spot."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my earlier review.  Nothing has changed,  i still come to this place once or twice a week. Since the remodeling its only slightly upgraded but i still dont care. I get good service and the food is good and the drinks are always good.  Alyssa is my favorite server:)  Tip. Forget the wings and go for the strippers!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the wings.  We've ordered wings from here a few times, because my husband likes them.  The last time we ordered from them, the wings were UNBELIEVABLY SMALL.  They must be trying to save money, but they just lost our business.  When they charge almost $17.00 for 24 wings, they better be a decent size.  Won't go again."}
{"text":"If you want down to earth American food with relaxing, beer sipping atmosphere, this is it.  We were here after a long active day outside and just wanted a big, hearty meal with beer.    We had the following: Spicy Honey Mustard + Asiago Permesan Dusted chicken wings - they were really dry and totally over done BUT on a different day, they were very juicy and yummy.....so yeah, depends on the day.  Hot Beef and Gravy Sandwich - VERY YUMMY.  This sandwich is so simple, totally easy to make but amazingly great!   *Location = good *Food = yummy.  if you want wings, it's hit and miss depending on the day *Service = average *Price = descent"}
{"text":"After a not so good first visit, we gave Native another try tonight. Our experience was very good.  We were seated after a short wait and were greeted by our young waiter Brandon. He was very good. Brought our drinks immediately and kept us informed on our progress of our meal. Also checked on us during our meal. This visit was an all around good experience. Brandon was probably one of the best we have had for wait staff in this area. We will return again in the future."}
{"text":"It had been over a year since the last time we were here. The only reason we came was because of my son's fundraiser. That last time was not a great experience but this time around was different. I felt compelled to write a review. The host was friendly and sat us quickly. Our server was great (unlike the sever we had last time). He was prompt and attentive. The wings were tasty and my calzone was good. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"You know when you're feeling hungry and somebody mentions food, then all the sudden you have to have it? Wing night at Native, and the oh please look from my son and off we went. Tuesday night is 49 cent wing night, and it was worth it! We started the night with an appetizer, Asian flat bread, perfect starter, like a little Asian pizza. The same son of mine who gave the wing please look decided he wanted a bacon cheese burger, yes he got it, almost put him in a food coma! I stuck with the wings, unlike like some other places that make you order so many of one kind or another, Connor told me I could order one of each if I so chose to and they don't charge for ranch like other places either! I ordered 5 flavors, I enjoy a little variety, and he brought them all on seperate plates with their own ranch! My little girl asked for a cherry coke and since it wasn't on the menu Connor had one made up for her, that's good service, Connor you Rock! We had a great night and it didn't break this Mama's bank to do it! We'll definitely go back, those Spicy Honey Mustard, Honey Hot,Asian garlic, Mandarin Orange and oh yes and the Salt & Pepper wings are calling my name!"}
{"text":"Love this place, perfect spot for hanging with the family and friends for Fight Nights! We come in early to grab a centrally located spot surrounded by huge tvs for a great view from any seat! No matter how long we hang out or how much or little we eat the service is always on top of their game! I've become a fan of their Garbage pizza, topped with pepperoni, banana peppers, sausage, tomatoes, meatballs, jalapenos and green olives it's a pile of spicy goodness! Their wings always a winner from mild to suicide, salt & pepper to my finger licking favorite honey hot! Their NY'er cookie sundae is the perfect way to finish, a fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup & creamy whip; a definite TKO!"}
{"text":"This used to be a standard stop for us when my husband and I were craving different foods. After two disappointing visits this month alone, we'll probably cross it off the list. Until recently, greeters and servers were attentive, and the food good.  We visited late in the day August 12 - the lettuce in my salad was limp and trimmed so poorly, I got the hard ribs and a piece of the core. (I did receive a $5 discount when I pointed it out.) When we visited August 24, there was no one at the greeting stand, but the uniformed young woman sitting and visiting at a nearby booth greeted us and briefly considered getting up to seat us, but left it for someone else to do. Our server was distracted, repeated our beverage order to us, wrong, but ultimately brought the right beverage. My meal was wrong, bringing an appetizer platter rather than a strip platter, and when corrected, the wings were overcooked and repurposed from the appetizer platter and fries obviously scraped from the bottom, providing mostly nubs. We didn't even bother to complain this time - just paid and left. Food can only be as good as local management, I think, which appears to be slipping."}
{"text":"Saturday night was our first night visiting and it was super disappointing. My 1 year olds kid's meal burger was not cooked and bright red in the center, they forgot her side of oranges which come with it, they forgot my side of wing sauce and brought it when I was one wing from being finished, they brought my friend's salad with the main course, and her son got his food 15 minutes after everyone else. I will say, it was a UFC fight night which I think could be reason for a few smaller mistakes but this many? There's no excuse for serving a child undercooked food. I wouldn't visit again or recommend."}
{"text":"Good bar, and great wings!!! Tuesday and Thursday .39 cent wing nights. I stop in one of their locations every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Fast service, great wings, and homemade potato chips, when I'm going off the diet this is where I head. Go on a Tue or Thur they have .29 wing nights and not those sissy boneless wings, the real wings, the yummy suck on the bone kind!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here every Tuesday for wings. The prices for wings keep going up and we continue to go. We also go here seldomly on other days with no deals and the prices are still reasonable. However, they're getting way too expensive. A pack of 6 wings is almost six dollars. That's $1 a wings. Sorry but they will no longer be getting our business."}
{"text":"I have been going to Native since I was a child so I always love the food. Order the Honey hot chicken strippers and make sure your server is Amber. She is the reason I go here."}
{"text":"I come here often to watch a game, have an adult beverage or just to relax. This place is near my house which is always nice but the food not the service never disappoints! The staff is always friendly and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Well, I ended up back this native for a work function and I must say, I am impressed. Not sure what happened, but they did a 180 degree turn for the better. I was told by the waitress that they made a few changes and I should try the wings again. I did and was very happy. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience at Native, it was a little surprising. I went here with a couple of friends to watch a World Cup semifinal match and we received excellent customer service on top of a great lunchtime deal.   First about the deal - when you buy a drink, wings were only 35 cents from opening to close. My total lunch bill was like $8 and I was STUFFED. How can they afford to sell at prices so low?!  Now about the service - our waitress Rachel was the best waitress ever. She checked in frequently, made sure we were able to take advantage of ever deal available, anticipated when we would be needing a refill, and made sure we wanted for nothing. It was amazing customer service. I wish I could give her 5 stars!  In summary: great food, deal, and staff. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Here is a piece of professional advice: How about if somebody looks at the food before it comes out of the kitchen. There was not a single thing right on any of the five meals we ordered tonight. The food was BAD. Taste really off. Service was ok. The menu is really lacking....A LOT.  This was our third and last time."}
{"text":"Sat inside the bar area. It took 45 minutes to get my food. The bar only had 1 server working. Wow! couldn't believe that 1 server for the whole bar. I cannot recommend this place ever. Read all the other reviews and you will change your mind. I won't ever be coming back"}
{"text":"I love their wings and my family likes to go there from time to time. But if you want to be able to have a conversation with your family and they sit you by a family that allows their kids to act like it's a playground don't count on it. We asked just to switch tables because we realized it was quieter but they insisted it there were no other seats because it being Sunday football but those there for the sports didn't bother us. They took long to bring out the pizza too.  On our way out the manager says Sorry about the noise but its Sunday football. Smh! Maybe we'll just order to go from now on."}
{"text":"The wings were OK but certainly not worth the price we were charged. Their menu said you couild add a salad for $1.95 but when the bill came, we were charged $3.95. For 2 of us to eat wings, fries, an order of onion rings, 1 beer, 1 alcoholic beverage & 2 salads, it was over $50. A little too pricey for wings in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been going to Native for 20 years (it used to be Native New Yorker).  These guys still have my favorite wings in the valley.  Also, the antipasto salad is fantastic.  My other favorite is the Beef on Kummelweck.  With horseradish, it's really good!  I have had issues with slow service here before, but tonight it was very good and the waitress was super friendly and quick.  This is a bar and grill type restaurant so don't expect something different!  For a beer and wings night though, for a reasonable price, I think Native is still hard to beat."}
{"text":"Had a much better experience here this visit.  Kim was a stellar server and the manager Steve is a very nice guy that aims to please.  Thanks again guys... J."}
{"text":"Been to this native many times over the past year. Always had great service.   On Sunday night my buddy and I stopped in after work to have a beer before heading home for the night.   Everything was fine I suppose until the end. First my beer had a fly land in it with maybe 20% of the beer left. No big deal. I didn't need that changed, it was just odd that the bartender only said \"it's that time of year\" and didn't offer me a water or some kind of gesture for this while waiting for our checks.   After presenting our checks I quickly laid out a $10 bill for my $5.48 check for a tall Dos xx. The bartender waited nearly 15 minutes to even approach taking it. She then remarked if I would need change. Well of course I do, it's fairly presumptuous to expect a 100% tip. It took her a few minutes of fumbling around to give me $4 bucks back.   I didn't realize until I got home that I wasn't even given the $.52 cents in change back either. Frustrating.   It was quiet in there on what looked to be a busy night in the neighboring bars and restaurants. I don't foresee coming back if staff does things like this to their paying guests."}
{"text":"The service is awful.  Was with a colleague today sat at the bar and had mediocre service at best from the bartender. She would walk past us to ask others for refills of beer, while we had tea. The food was bland and just as good as the service. I'm giving them two stars because the place was very clean. Make better food and train the bartender to notice everyone especially if it's lunch and time is of the essence. Will not be back, been there twice same story different day."}
{"text":"I never have very high expectations of Native New Yorker. I came to this place because it's close to home and they have karaoke that starts at 9 PM on Saturdays. My husband and I dropped in at around 10 PM and ordered some drinks and appetizers off the happy hour they had on the bar counters, and when our bill came the kind waitress decides to charge us full price for everything because she entered our orders in at 9:58 PM.   It's probably my fault for not checking the exact time before I ordered, I know. But still, it'd be awesome if she could've said that we'd save $15 if we just waited a couple more minutes to order. I guess that'd be too obvious, though, right? :)   Either way, this place is really fun for karaoke and there's usually always a great crowd that makes it exciting."}
{"text":"This place is horrible don't waste your time or your money food wasn't all that great chicken seemed a little bit undercooked the staff is just a bunch of kids that like to stand around and not do anything every time I looked up at the television in front of me just watch the ball game I felt like I was staring at them because there was about 10 of them standing there staring back at me definitely not a place I'll come to you again"}
{"text":"Food ok u have to tell them how u want ur wing cook or they will be under cook sad part is not one person know how to make a lemon drop Martini so sad don't like this place hire someone that can make a good drink . Why is it that u go to school but everyone suck at making a Martini  Won't go back"}
{"text":"We just moved to Chandler from San Diego and it's been quite a challenge finding our new watering hole. We are huge baseball fans and we occasionally like to go out and watch a game so naturally we tried this place. We have been here several times and I  (personally) have left severely disappointed. I always order the same thing: boneless wings with a side salad. Their boneless wings are complete garbage. You'll receive rock hard bits of \"wings\" and they consider that part of the plate. You might find a couple of pieces worth eating, but if you appreciate good boneless wings like i do,  you'll definitely want to order something else from this menu. My boyfriend always gets traditional wings  (bone -in) and a beer. They never have the beer he wants on draft (modelo especial). This last time we visited, the seating hostess took our order because no one approached our table. She was unclear whether or not she was going to be or server. I ordered a personal pizza (I gave up on the wings) with pepperoni and sausage and my bf got his usual. We received our food fairly quickly (which to me seemed suspect aka suspicious). I did not get the pizza i ordered (I'm not usually picky so I didn't send it back. I don't like being that person, I always feel bad), and my bf's wings were cold and with the wrong dip (he asked for blue cheese and they gave him ranch).  He sent them back, disappointed and obviously frustrated  (he usually leaves Native happy) and he told the girl that they were cold and he didn't plan on paying for them or ordering anything else.   What I can say is that they did try to remedy the situation, took both of our meals off the ticket and offered my bf something else. What we did notice is that the table next to us sent their food back to the kitchen as well. Overall, I have left native disappointed every time we've been here, which has been 5 times so far. And my bf left here hungry.   Im sure we'll be back, there isn't a buffalo wild wings close by and my bf does like their wings,  he just prefers them to be hot and fresh (the nerve lol)."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this location. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with our wings and sides. Both the wings and coleslaw lacked any sauce and were quite bland. Definitely some potential with this location since the ambiance is much better than other locations we have visited throughout Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just left this place and the food was delicious and the waitress \"Alicia I believe \" did a great job on attending us. Not many good places here in laveen. Definitely recommend good food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Ok so I wish I could put 5 Stars the wings were the best wings I have ever had.  However the waiter was a complete asshole (excuse my language) but comeon when your guest ask you question don't respond to them like they are complete idiots.  His harsh personality really rub me the wrong way. He went from a potential $30 tip to a $5 in the first 10 mins.   Managment please train your staff to have better costumer service! Never have I felt like an idiot or a waste of a waiter time! I'm so annoyed !!!!!!   I don't want to be a totally b so I will refrain from saying his name but if managment wants to know I have a copy of my Receipt. Between 3 party's our tab could of been a few hundred dollars. I'm so app-led how he responded to us asking questions or ordering. I'm shocked"}
{"text":"Well I have been to this native 3 times now first time was a few months after it opened and I heard alot of hype about it and the service and food was terrible, figured they where having a off day and gave them another shot and a huge fail.  This 3rd time we went to Don Pedros and I heard alot of good things and I wanted to do taco tuesday, Don Pedros is a waste the wait the nasty salsa bar and the fact that they don't acknowledge you.   I made a quick call asked if there was a wait at native and told the family we are trying them one more time, we where sat upon arrival, the waitress came and took our drink order shortyly after that she took our food order the apps came out quick and hot and not under or over cooked, main course came out and the burgers where hot and the wings where hot and perfect.  Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and kept the drinks full and never empty, I have no problem being that asshole and whistling or walking behind the serving station to fill my drink,   But spot on and we will return for another meal."}
{"text":"We have visited Native for the last time... the food has gotten worse in the 2 years I have lived here and the pizza...  not gonna happen to me again.  The wings are just OK but not worth the effort to go back when you can get them everywhere here.   Fuggetbouit Native NY'er we are moving on."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant we frequent regularly because of proximity to house.  You have the option to sit in family dining area or back in the bar area that has numerous TVs for watching your favorite sports games.  The food is always good.  The service always frustrates me though.  It varies per each visit.  When you are in a hurry, getting your food takes forever no matter the crowd.  Calling in you better add 15-20 minutes past the time they tell you order will be ready."}
{"text":"Andrew Bartender !!! Was amazing!!! Food was good !!! Drinks were awesome!!! I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this location again (after a bad experience) at around 1 PM and I actually had a much better experience. The waitress was phenomenal. She was friendly and very accommodating to us. I was really impressed, she would even refill my drink without me asking. This time I got wings and while they could have been better (Asiago Parmesan wings had like no cheese on them and sauces were kinda lacking) I was satisfied. I guess there are just certain times of the day when you will get better service."}
{"text":"Great vibe service  ! Megan the bartender was great !!! Good place to just chill have some drinks friendly staff ."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting three stars is because of the cleanliness of the restaurant and most of all the service. My family and I went in on mothers day, it seemed nice enough but i was skeptical because of the low review score on yelp. We ordered a couple of beers and a zucchini appetizer to start. It was hot and yummy. Our waitress Mackenzie(sp?) was very sweet and helpful. The problem is most definitely the kitchen. The Fish sliders i ordered were dry and mediocre ( The Irish wolfhounds are way better) but at least my order was hot. My fiancé ordered 15 wings and they were cold inside so we had to send them back, not to mention they are ridiculously small. My stepson ordered the buffalo nachos which came out lukewarm. We were pretty unhappy but the manager Matt quickly had the kitchen remake their food and comped us for their items plus gave us a free dessert. Our waitress handled the whole situation pretty well as well. Needles to say if i want delicious wings I will go to BWW. My fiancé and i will be back for a UFC fight or some other sports event and have a few beers and maybe some appetizers but so far the food is nothing to rave about. Native needs to either get better cooks or train them better."}
{"text":"I was having a lunch meeting with my co-worker at Native Grill & Wings. For lunch, I ordered the the choice of chicken and salad. I chose the one and half pound of boneless chicken and salad. The flavor of the boneless chicken I got is the honey hot. I like the combined flavor of sweet and spicy! To balance it off, I've topped it on the salad. It's was delicious!   For my co-worker, she ordered the chicken wrap. It looked pleasing the dish a-crossed from me. She finished her meal and the side fruit.  The service we had was excellent, the waitress checked on us four times. To see were happy with our food. Overall, it was a great lunch meeting."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else.  First, attempted to place an order online.  Fail.  Second, called and placed the order with the manager Tommy.  Arrived and signed the bill at the bar.  Waited.  Received the order and drove 15-20 mins home.  Opened bag to find 2 of the 3 orders missing sauce.  Kinda pointless to have strips without sauce.  Called to discuss with manager who said I could come pickup the sauce.  20 mins each way, food would be cold by then.  Told him they could remake it all, he declined.  He offered 10 bucks as credit, I asked him to refund it since it was pointless.  He argued, advised he would leave 15 buck on a credit.  I asked again to have the ruined meals refunded and he finally agreed, at 15 bucks.  Proceeded to eat what was left of the order, and I find this...does that even look like a wing.  Burnt to a crisp.  Sad..."}
{"text":"Went here with several friends from out of town.  We happend to show up on a \"fight night\" - but sat on the other side of the resturant.  Had a party of five, and waited nearly20 minutes for a table.  (The hostess acted like our party of 5 was the biggest group she's ever heard of, and stated: We have to wait for another huge group to leave to give you there table\")  we asked about sitting outside, but because one of our group was pregnant the woman stated \"That is where the smokers sit, and I wouldn't feel comfortable seating her there..\" which I thought was odd.   Once we were seated, our waitress was friendly but obviously very busy.  Forgot drink orders, multiple times, kept setting the rum and coke in front of the pregnant girl, and the regular coke in front of the drinker... which was odd (she did it twice?!) forgot about our desert (after 20 minutes we asked about it... and she ran to the kitchen... said it was burned, and would have to make another... but honestly I think she forgot)   Then the bill was wrong.   It was just one thing after another... I recognize they had a special event, and it was very busy - buf if you're going to have your staff working both a special event, and regular food service, you might want to consider hiring extra wait staff. There is NO reason they needed three hostesses...   I don't think we will be back to this location."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Gilbert area for over 10 years now & have yet to find a place that serves better hot wings!! Nice & crispy (which is key!) with several tasty sauce choices to choose from. We love the pizza too, the simple but awesome cheese pizza is our fav;) Great draft beer selection too!! Love to get the deals at happy hour:)  We always leave satisfied & stuffed.  Amber is the BEST!! Super friendly, knowledgeable & provides great service - even remembers our order!! We are regulars who visit this location often because of the good food & wonderful staff."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to native several times but we were on the verge of not coming back. The service was horrendous. However, we went back earlier this week and were served by Cassy. Cassy was wonderful!!!! Greatest us right away (in the past we've waited almost 20 min), she was attentive and very friendly. I hope when we go back Cassy is our server again."}
{"text":"Let me start with a story.  In preschool, the teacher requested for everyone to write down their dreams in a little book that got laminated for all the proud parents. I was in a class full of future ballerinas, presidents and fire fighters; and there I was... On my quest to work at a \"the chicken wing hut\"  That chicken wing hut was actually Native New Yorker, which is now known to you as Native Grill and Wings.   I loved it when I was 4... And I love it now at 27. Trust me, best chicken wings I've had....ever. Enjoy a few for me when you go.  (Hint: go for the Buffalo and Honey Hot)."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends who finally convinced me to the the \"the best place for wings\". I ended up not being to impressed, sure food was okay. .just not amazing, service was decent. . nothing too other world-ly, and prices were just what I expected. Place offers a lot of ambient, but this place is nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"This place is super disappointing. The first time I went in for lunch we got seated, I was waiting for the rest of my party for about 10 minutes. As soon as I sat down the server came over and took my drink order and asked if I was ready to order right away. I said no, that I was waiting for the rest of my party. He comes back 5 minutes later to give me my drink and asks again, I said no I'm waiting for the rest of my party and asked about a few of the wing flavors as it was my first time here, he just said I don't know to everything then walked away. Then my husband gets there and as SOON as he sits down the guy comes over and asks again seeming kind of annoyed now. I felt super rushed and thought the server was very rude, I would understand more if they were busy and he was trying to get our order in but there was only two other tables sitting in the restaurant. The food was okay though I liked the wings but thought the burger was super small for being over $10. Anyways so after that I decided to give it another chance and ordered dinner from them the other night. I got a 6 piece of wings with extra ranch and a cookie with ice cream for dessert. I get home to realize they didn't give me ANY ranch (even though they charged me for extra) and the cookie for the cookie Sunday was almost inedible because it was so burnt. A cookie only takes a few minutes to cook, if you're going to charge $6 for it then burn it, don't be lazy and make a fresh one!!! AND half of my wings were undercooked inside. Which is super annoying because I only got 6 and they were $1 a piece!! Needless to say my dinner was ruined and I wasted almost $15 to be able to eat 3 wings and a little scoop of ice cream that was supposed to go on the cookie they burnt. Horrible place from the service to the food to the consistency. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Cold fries... sent back.. they came back as fast as I sent them back... meaning they micro nuked them.. I could do that at home...which I dont ever ! Servers are great though"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Go to wings place for me if I'm staying near home. Good choice of beer and nice big glasses also. Service is ok and never too crowded."}
{"text":"Our go to spot for drinks and grub with the kids.  Patient and friendly servers.  Great bartender!  Always leave happy."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to go,Ashley and Brandi were great. So friendly, great food, great drinks and great service! highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered Pizza and traditional wings. The service however okay but slow. The servers don't communicate to well. They took forever to get us our drinks. Also the restaurant itself was messy and just looked dirty."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of these restaurants and the ones before this one made me not want really want to give this company a third try but I did. This location changed my opinion. Not only was the wings amazing but so were the strippers. I rarely have a problem with how the food turns out. Honey BBQ is my favorite flavor. The staff there are also quite friendly. This location is a bit far but it's the best one so I don't mind making the drive."}
{"text":"The wings here weren't too bad but on the dry side and lacking flavor. I went here to try it out for the first time and I was not satisfied with the taste. I'll give this company another try but at a different location. The staff here was nice though."}
{"text":"The wings here were nowhere close to what I ordered. I don't know what I ate but it didn't taste right. It had a weird flavor and it was also all dried out. The staff however was friendly."}
{"text":"I have only had the chicken wings here, but I have to say that the wings are fabulous! The ambiance is a bit too \"sports-barish\" and short of the wings I probably would not come to this place at all. The outside patio is actually pretty nice, the beers are fairly priced and the service is good.  If you do go here: try the wings!"}
{"text":"Waited extra long for anorder I had called in 30 min prior and came home only to realize all the wings I had order were burnt couldn't even eat half of them and the other half I had to drench in ranch because the burnt taste was so gross thanks guys! Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I've unfortunately been here 3 times because I live within walking distance.  Don't remember what I got the first time but it sucked - the second time I got nachos- HOW CAN YOU MESS UP NACHOS?  I don't know, but the native New Yorker knows. This time we came for wing night.  My husband liked it which is why I gave it an extra star.  Buffalo wings were okay, honey bbq wings were okay, buffalo ranch wings were the absolute worst thing I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  Tasted like salt and nothing else. My husbands beer was flat and he ended up giving it to the people next to us. Water was warm.  Restaurant was very hot. Service was not bad.   They replaced our wings when we told them it was inedible.  The waitress said she knows they're not good but a lot of people like them.  This information would've been useful YESTERDAY!    Also, two dozen wings come with the smallest saddest celery sticks ever and no carrots"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on many occasions, each time I like to pick Dakota's section, he is my absolute favorite server there! I normally order the buffalo chicken dip and pizza, without a doubt always a pleasant food experience with Dakotas help of course!"}
{"text":"We went to Native New Yorker tonight and two people myself and our guest ordered the bbq pork sliders. He ate two of his and I also ate two of mine and brought the rest home.  About two hours later my guest decided to finish off the sliders and while eating realized that there was mold on the pretzel buns.  We have never had an issue with food at this location but will now be very wary of eating there.  It turned my stomach to think I ate a moldy sandwich."}
{"text":"July 2nd between 2 and 4 p.m. we visited this location the bartender was are waitress, she was very distracted with her significant other that was seated at the bar she spent more time conversating, kissing and flirting, then she did tending to the customers. We had to send back two different plates due to them being incorrect or cold when delivered to our table. The food may have been up to temperature when they first came out of the kitchen but by the time she was done kissing and delivered the food it had went cold. When we brought this to her attention it seemed as though we were making it inconvenient for her. All in all it was the worst location to visit due to the lack of service of all Native Grill and Wings."}
{"text":"I have never been treated the way I was today at this Native. Been coming for years since they opened and it has never been great compared to the other Natives, but today was horrible.   We all ordered bone-in wings, except my son. I ordered him 1/2 a pound of the strippers. When our food came out, his strippers were missing. I told the waitress that his order was missing so she went back to tell them. Later the Manager came out with what I thought was his wings. (I guess he brought a pound versus the 1/2 pound).  Anyway, when it came time to pay, they charged me 2xs for full pound strippers. ($18). I told her we only ordered 1/2 pound ($4.50). Huge difference. She went back and came out with new receipt that only took off $2 so I checked it again. Well they changed 1 of the orders to half a pound but still left the the other full pound.   Well the Manager came back saying that he personally gave us a pound of strippers and asked why I didn't complain than. At this point I got so mad being called a liar. I told him I wasn't an expert and didn't weigh them, that was supposed to be their job. I explained to him what I ordered and that his order never came. He thought I ordered and put in a 2nd order after and said that's what the waitress explained. As a Manager, he should ask before assuming. I felt it was so disrespectful treating me like a liar in front on my family and friends. So irritated. They really suck.  Server was Taylor & Manager Nick. I called the server out for making me look like a liar in front of the Manager and she pouted and walked away. No empathy."}
{"text":"Forget this place.  The food is just mediocre and prices high for the quality.  Take the margarita pizza....  if so much as one slice is missing or has very little tomato, it ceases to be a \"margarita\" pizza.  If there is no \"fresh\" basil, it ceases to be a margarita pizza.  Well, that's the way it's served here for what ever reason.  It could just be clueless \"young people\" manning the kitchen (like a lot of places) and they just don't know any better, haven't been trained correctly, or merely following the restaurant's poor choice and quantity of ingredients.  Even if you order extra tomato, they take the order like they're going to make it happen, but when you get it, it's the same old pizza with 5-6 slices of tomato on an 8-slice pie.  So basically what you get is cheese and crust.  There's not even any basil \"leaves\" like a true, authentic margarita, just a sparse sprinkling of dried basil \"flakes\" with zero flavor.  Please, Native, don't advertise something that's NOT!  And when it comes to the wings, I have no doubt that they cook them up fresh, but they're usually just barely done and on the chewy side, far from fall-off-the-bone scrumptious.  This isn't just one or two visits either, it's every visit and I've finally made up my mind to not return, especially since the prices are in that \"just too high for what you get\" range.  Oh, and the beer is on the pricy side too.  Not outrageously expensive, but pricy.  Try $5.75 for a \"small\" Blue Moon that can be knocked down in 5-6 gulps.  That's a buck a swallow not including a tip, for beer!  So to go there (by yourself) and watch a ball game, have a few beers and a meal, you can easily spend $50-60 all by yourself and walk out with a small take-home box, and I'm not a big person with a big appetite.  And if you go there with your \"family\", stay away from the bar area!  You've been warned!  Their regulars are loud, rude, crude, act like they own the joint and that nobody else exists.  On game day it ceases to be a \"family restaurant\" unless your kids grew up in a crude household and are used to it.  These are all facts and undeniable."}
{"text":"Went back after a week of getting horrible service. It was much better this time. Our waitress Denise was very nice and the general manager JJ was very nice when talking about what I went through last time. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Always a great place for wings, however if your wife is with you do not ask the waitress for 1 pound of hot strippers especially if she has never been here before. The staff is pleasant and very quick. I don't believe I have ever had to ask for the same thing twice. Other then a bruised arm my overall experience was better then 5 stars. Make sure to play the in house game if your there with your family. No need for small talk and it gets your kids away from their cell phones. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Waiter was very attentive.  He gave my grandson a paper coloring page menu along with crayons.   He took our orders immediately and served us fast. I will definately go back.   Food was pretty good and he showed me how to download there app. for a free coupon!"}
{"text":"We waited so long my daughter said ( daddy we can eat pretend food like on the movie Hook when we finally got her macaroni it looked like it had been dried out and was ready to be made into a necklace. It had been under the heat lamp so long. My wife had a unseasoned chicken club with hard cold fries and I had a calzone that was worse than a cold stale hot pocket in other words"}
{"text":"Native Grill and Wing is hands down one of my friends and I favorite eating establishments. We go here to watch big sporting events especially UFC events. However, the stop we had on 2/18/17 might have been the worst. It started with our horrible server who was clearly in a bad mood. We've been to this location on multiple occasions and she reported, we could not make a switch we made multiple times, which leads me to believe she isn't familiar with the menu or is simply lazy. Also, my friend had a coupon for a free sundae for his birthday and she snatched the phone and was rude about the whole ordeal. We definitely will be making sure we don't get her again on our next trip. She rarely checked up on us, and it led to a very nice young lady by the name of Grace who was very helpful and passionate about her job. All I will say about the server is her named started with a K."}
{"text":"Called in an order for 15 wings. Was told 20 minutes and got them an hour later. They were fresh and good but no reason at all for 15 songs to take am hour. Crispy or not lol...they also REFUSE to give me bleu cheese lol. I've been twice and asked to it twice. Was given ranch both times. Dine in AND take out. Gonna try another location, food is good, but too much trouble and not worth the fight"}
{"text":"First time here in years........ Food was terrible!!! Last time I'll eat here!!"}
{"text":"So I have a coupon where it does NOT state we couldn't use it on wings. The manager came out with an attitude and didn't even listen to us or look at the coupon to see that it was not specified.   Manager was very unpleasant definitely won't be back to Native at all."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I have only been to this location once before and really liked the wings. Decided to go today for lunch around 1pm. It was pretty dead so I figured it shouldn't be to long. It took over 30 min to get my order. 6 salt and vinegar 6 spicy mustard 12 honey bbq wings. When the order came out they shorted me 4 wings. The waitress was great but I asked for a manager. This gentleman proceeded to tell me that they don't make many wings during lunch so orders had to be cooked individually and that takes 15 to 20min. Umm ok but I waited over 30. Then the kicker he said I'll bring you the missing wings....i thought to myself \"Will I have to wait atleast 15 more minutes?\" Nope he came right out with not only the missing 4 wings but 4extra. So Why did it take so long to get my first order. He didn't really apologize just acted like I was being ridiculous. Didn't offer to take anything off the bill. I might give them one more chance but I doubt it."}
{"text":"First time here and I don't understand why some reviews are so bad!  Wonderful service from Marisa and the other servers were also helpful.  Marisa continuously had a warm smile and made us feel comfortable even while we asked (probably too many) questions about the menu.  They have really good happy hour deals 7 days a week.  Restaurant was very clean and an older gentleman (I'm assuming the manager) was very kind and checked in on us.  We ordered boneless off the happy hour menu and the Asian Garlic sauce was delicious.  I had the chicken parm sandwich and my boyfriend had the hangover burger.  There was nothing over the top with our entrees but overall it was good!  We will definitely be coming back here again.  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner today around 6:30. We were seated immediately and our server came to ask for drink and appetizer orders within a minute. We got pizza, sliders, a burger, combo appetizer platter and some drinks. Everything came out hot and correct. Only complaint would be that my Long Island was a bit weak but that is a matter of opinion. Service was very good throughout the meal."}
{"text":"I love it when tennial is working we keep coming back every Friday good beer great wings and good company"}
{"text":"Sometimes you really just crave some wings and Native is usually pretty decent. I don't expect a five star dining experience here, but I DO expect decent food and service for the money. We came on a very quiet Friday night as a party of 8. After taking our drink orders, the waitress asked if we needed more time, and we asked for 5 more minutes. She didn't return 20 minutes later, not even 30 minutes later. 40 minutes passed and I finally flagged down a bus boy to grab her. The food took another 30 minutes and arrived cold, and several of us never got one drink refill the entire time. We were all still hungry for more wings after eating but didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for our order, so we paid our $65.00 check plus tip and left. We definitely  plan on stopping by Taco Bell on the way home."}
{"text":"Was out at Native New Yorker and Jessica my bartender was awesome. Made Avondale cooler than it sounds..;-)"}
{"text":"Went there last night.. it took 15 minutes for someone to even acknowledge that we were there and get our water. All we ordered were some strippers and boneless wings.... took an entire hour to get them and they were chewy! Wish I was kidding cause we love Native.. but they seemed more concerned with singing happy birthday 4 times then helping everyone else. Looking around, you could tell everyone was frustrated and had been waiting a long time. At least have the courtesy to come check on your customers and let them know why it's taking so long to get a small order out. Won't be back to this location. We'll make the longer trip to Westgate."}
{"text":"Just spent the day at native on Broadway. We had great drinks while watching the game. Mike the manager personally stopped by our table to make sure things were great. The bartender had great drink suggestions, i tired the John Daily, it was amazing. The wings are bigger now than they were a while back. In loving the changes that have been made at Native. Try the dry rub wings."}
{"text":"This place is an Equal opportunity establishment unlike the place down at the end of the strip mall. Chandler the manager twice has understood and has heard how rude loco patron treats certain types of clients. Has welcomed my crew with open arms and great service and drinks. If your looking for a fun night come here. You will feel welcomed and enjoy the bar food!"}
{"text":"This place is nice for the kids, the food comes quick, and if you get Matt you got the best service."}
{"text":"Usually fairly good. The last few times at multiple locations, the wings were over cooked, dry and pretty much horrible. It was lunch on Sunday and these should have been cooked perfectly as the place wasn't busy at all. The server was great, but she can't control the kitchen. I may look for  another wing source , which is sad, since I have been coming to Native (locations)  for 20 years. Now, all of the side sauces are now extra. I doubt a small cup of sauce hurts the bottom line that much,   since they are usually requested with a purchase. Relax and focus on food quality before seeking more money in smaller ways. If the quality isn't there, then don't worry, the customers won't be either.   Extra chances are few at hand. It's easy for me to leave, and ever easier to keep me as a customer, just try harder. Good luck."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The meaty beast pizza is so so good! The only gal I love to serve us is Jerilyn. She is amazing so sweet and fast, she is always ontime with a new beer I really never need to ask and she remembers my order and has it out in a timly fashion. We always hug her at the end of the meal to let her know we love her!!!!"}
{"text":"Have to say out of all the Natives we've been to this by far is the least desirable. Service....well what service? Food....maybe it will arrive soon and we can give feedback."}
{"text":"Love their wings - the best are the honey hot wings! Appetizer platter had a good variety . Servers in the bar area were attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had at a native New Yorker. Food pretty standard for NNY, but will be back because of the service."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant if course but good happy hour and food service was good and friendly. Defenetly recommend."}
{"text":"Str8 up the worst Native I have ever been to, my fiancé and I sat 4 10 mins before even being greeted and it was from the manager and she took drink order then we didn't see our actual waiter for another 15 mins. On top of all that the potato skins I ordered were the worst I have ever had as well. The wings were ok but the time it took to get them wasn't worth it at all. We live near this place so it really sucks that we will not b returning bc of the service and we love Native!"}
{"text":"Came in today for the Tuesday wing special. Wings were excellent and service great. I have eaten here a few times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"It took a while for us to be seated and the place was empty. My server was alright but when the fries were brought out it wasn't a good amount for 5.00 and they were cold :( When I expressed to the waitress that the fries were cold the manager came by and got us fresh hot fries so that was very nice. I have been to cleaner, happier locations though,"}
{"text":"Came to Arizona for business, from California. Me and my business partner decided to stop at this wings place. The food quality is amazing, and the calzone best I ever had, but the service is horrific. Took them an hour to serve us food after they kept telling us every 15 min food was almost ready. Place has potential if management gets it together and start holding these waitresses accountable."}
{"text":"Wings are good, Pizza's good, beer is cheap...and good, and the waitors/waitresses are fun and helpful and very nice.  PLUS football season is my fav. and it's the best place to be for it.  LOVE this place."}
{"text":"The wings here are amazing. They make Buffalo Wild Wings look really bad and you will never want to go back to bdubs. Not as good as Angel's Trumpet though."}
{"text":"Well, I came in, met the owner or manger Kevin. Great guy, wants his customers to have a great experience. He gave me and my gf Nathalie to wait on is. She was perfection. I love great service and kindness and information. We had a very hard time deciding what to get because Kevin suggested something so good we wanted to share it and try else new. I've been here many times before on the bar side with a large group and this was my second time in since the fire. This was exactly how things are supposed to go. Greeted, seated, checking in, kindness, I loved it all and so did my gf. The new seating seems to seat more than before, more open, the food still great as ever. I learned of a steak and bacon sandwich which was awesome. A few beers topped off the night. I will definitely be back and try to get another group together soon for a Friday night karaoke night. They have a lot of seating in the bar they have an outdoor patio they have TVs everywhere this is a great place to go and I suggest you all bring your friends and try it. If there were more stars I would absolutely give them more. Thank you for a great night"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and I become increasingly disappointed. The salt and pepper chicken wings were sprinkled with rather than fried in salt and pepper. The 3 pork sliders: the meat was mushy, served on what looked like cheap dinner rolls. The last Caesar salad was short on romaine. 3rd time was not a charm."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just crazy but I love my wings how they're advertised. My boyfriend got an order or medium wings and I got an order of hot wings. They tasted the same, barely had flavor, dry and barely had any spicyness either. Maybe I should've gone for the ghost pepper. Shrugs. We also got an order of the cookie sundae which was good but would've been better without a burnt bottom. Overall very disappointed with the price I paid. Guess I'll keep looking for a good wing place."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with the wings or pizza, but the flatbread pizza was amazing!"}
{"text":"I came with my wife and a group of friends on a Saturday night for karaoke.  Cool place.  TV's all around so you will not miss any sports action whether you sit out in the patio or inside.  The restaurant was clean and the service at first was very slow but it improved as the night went on.  When I mean slow what I mean is I sat down, got my first drink right away and pretty much had to flag our waitress down after 20 minutes to order some food.  You'd think a bar would want to upsell their food to make more money?  From 10 p.m.-1 a.m they have happy hour on their food where select appetizers are $4 & $5 each.  My wife and I ordered 2 Diet Cokes, an order of Buffalo Chips, Loaded fries and a 1/2 lb. of boneless wings.  All for $20.  Helluva deal.  The food was very delicious.  While I liked the Loaded Fries, I LOVED the Buffalo Chips!  Homemade sliced potatoes cooked perfectly with blue cheese crumbles and dressing.  On the boneless wings I ordered honey bbq sauce and they were a winner as well.  I would love to come back and try their pizza or calzones.  I know starting at 9 p.m. beers were $3 but I don't get into beer too much.  Karaoke is fun on Saturday nights and there was a decent crowd but you can easily find a table to sit at.  I will definitely come back.  If you're looking for a fun place to grab some grub and watch a game or just chill, Native New Yorker is the place for you."}
{"text":"We were starving for lunch, had never been to a Native New Yorker, so we thought what they heck.  I'm glad we had a coupon, but overall, I didn't think it was that bad.  I had the Philly, which, I will admit, hard to do right, but the meat had a decent taste and a good amount of cheese.  The only part I didn't understand was the extra charge for mushrooms and peppers...isnt that part of a Philly!  The do give you options on fries, which I like, the streak fries were, again, decent.  Our waiter was very nice, but seemed nonexistent at times.  Its pretty much your typical bar food with a pretty good bar ambiance."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!  We had a large group of 25 and Cassie did an amazing job getting our orders right and keeping it fun!"}
{"text":"Lyndsey is awesome! We had a great time and Lyndsay did a great job at attending our needs. She would check on us constantly with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Really like their pizzas! Service was great at lunch. Enjoyed wings and was able to get our flavor sauces on the side."}
{"text":"Went to eat here around 2:30 and ordered only half a pound of wings and waited till 3:45 to get them.... it wasn't even busy, the place only had 4 tables.. this place has the worse customer service! Never coming back! Also, the manager was totally rude! I honestly feel sick to my stomach from the cold food!"}
{"text":"Somehow, \"What's up\" does not seem to be an appropriate greeting for customers. Not once, but twice on the same visit. Followed up by nearly 10 minutes of waiting for service on the patio. No wonder I prefer Tukees!"}
{"text":"My cousins was in from out of town. My family had never gone to this restaurant. We were at our table for at least 15 mins... waitresses were going from table to table asking how they were. I could see the servers (I say waitresses only because they were all women) in the back kitchen area just standing! We waited a little longer. I was informed by my server friends that you don't \"Flag em' down\"  NOTHING!  We walked out! The hostess didn't even ask us what was wrong when we returned out menus. We went to Streets of New York across the parking lot."}
{"text":"To clarify my last view, whst sucks here is the FOOD. The service here; whether at the bar or on the dining floor has ALWAYS been exemplary. A great many of the staff have been here a great many years, that speaks well of management as well. What used to be a great regional chain has lost it's uniqueness due to corporate interference. Go back to the original menu abd quit trying to be Applebee's."}
{"text":"I will not be back.  Walked out after being seated and the 2 waitresses were more concerned about bussing a finished table than waiting on us. Waited over 15 minutes.  Not busy on the patio at all.  Not even a comment about being with us soon, although they looked right at us.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Our waitress was rude. Sorry to bother you but if I wanted bad service I would have stayed home and served myself. Management needs to an upgrade immeadetly!!! Terrible, Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good and it has been here for a really long time. Wings are very good. But, the other foodis, ahh so so. Our server was really good. She brought us everything we needed very quickly. We ordered from the 3 for $20.00 menu. THen ordered wings as an additional item. Our appitezer was very good, though way too much ranch. It was flatbread, more like a lavosh cracker with with cheese and bacon on it. Not bad! Our meals were The Chicken Pot Pie, tasted like something you would get on the plane.  The 2nd item was spicy fish sliders. Tasted very much like frozen breaded fish, with lots of tarter sause on cheap white bread. Hey that is what most people like. Our drinks were good as well as the wings.  Good staff, nice clean bathrooms. Parking is wicked and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've ever experienced. Plus the glasses were dirty, the plates and silverware had dried food/sauce on them, and when I asked for clean plates, we got more dirty ones. How hard is it to check before you bring them to the table? After that I was pretty turned off.   The Asian salad was mostly canned fruit, with 4 thin slices of chicken that didn't add up to a whole breast. The boneless wings were okay, but admittedly hard to screw up frozen nuggets tossed in jarred sauce. I just did not see/taste anything of quality there.   Finally, the waitress pretty much ignored us and didn't bus our table. Had to flag her down for the check more than 30 minutes after we had finished our lunch. Turned out she over charged us and after she \"fixed\" it, she short changed us! The whole experience was a gross, tiring, and regrettable one. You couldn't pay me to go back."}
{"text":"Not only does this place provide bad service but the wait staff will alter your receipt. I left the other day with a very clear 0$ for a tip and wouldn't you know my bank processed a charge for $5 more. So if Andre serves you be ready for him to steal your money!"}
{"text":"I love the wings and their house salad. I orderer the strawberry hot wings... unfortunately there weren't any  strawberry in it but the wings were cooked perfectly. And the sprinkled Mozzarella in my salad? Yum! They also has a mango vinaigrette dressing that pleased my taste buds. Sunday drinks specials and wings special for a great deal."}
{"text":"I love to come for the Micheladas!! Spicy and delicious with whatever beer u prefer!:)"}
{"text":"Slow service even though it wasn't busy, they brought out mine and my husbands food and forgot about our 2 children, we ordered their food way before ours...:/."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner during a rush and i had Travis as a server and I was very satisfied he was super friendly and the best server here. He was constantly moving I noticed him running back and forth from the patio to the dining room. I would highly recommend having travis as a server."}
{"text":"I was in buckeye and craving some wings, heard they had a $.35 wings all day today so I figured why not.   They didn't have any drink specials to go along with my lunch so that left me pretty disappointed and the size of the wings was pretty sad. Tiny miniature wings that match the price point.   The waitress I had today was pretty nice and made some conversation outside of the usual waitress tropes so big points for that (she earned this place that 3rd star).  Also be aware that not all the wings are sauces, some of them do come as a dry rub or with no sauce so be aware. The menu does mention the dry rub but didn't mention it was the only option. Overall not bad and will only serve as my last resort for wings."}
{"text":"I walked in and then straight back out.  Also, there was an attack in the parking lot involving a hammer."}
{"text":"Wings great service okay people were vaping inside this restaurant made me sick! Never saw a manager"}
{"text":"This place has the worst chicken I've ever had and I will never go here again. Chicken was hard and way over cooked. Tastes like dirty oil from the fryer and old flour"}
{"text":"The service is normally pretty good. Sometimes it takes longer than it should to get your food. Tuesdays are great for wings as they are just 35 cents per wing. I like sitting in the bar better but it's 21 and over at all times so we have to sit in the dining room if the kids are with us. Overall, it's a pretty good place for bar food and beer."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after Christmas shopping. The service was not great. We had to ask multiple times for more drinks. On top of the bad service, the bar was blaring screamo music. The bar had a lot of off duty employees hanging out along with some normal customers. There didn't seem to be anyone in charge. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came to pick up an order from here. Looks really nice & clean inside. Haven't had there food yet but looks & smells delicious. They also have pizza. Also they have happy hour! They have tvs around the place, & different channels on."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out for the first time this week. My friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Sharks game and I always wanted to try Native so we came here. It was decently busy because it was a Friday night. We sat at the bar in the outside patio area. The bartender was busy but super friendly and turned on the game. He was even nice enough to turn the volume on even though I was the only one there watching that game. We managed to get there for happy hour which was pretty good. $2.50 and $3 beers, appetizers for $4, as well as long islands and some other drinks for pretty cheap. The thing that will keep me coming back is the $2.50 Coronas and Pacificos, which are served all day everyday. The food was pretty generic. The buffalo chips were disappointing as was the artichoke dip and the tailgater sandwich. The strippers (or whatever the heck they are called) and my greek salad were were pretty good though. When its hot, the misters make the outside patio so nice. I will come here again to watch a game, drink too many Coronas, and pig out on wings, but pretty much for that reason only."}
{"text":"Went for wings with a work buddy on a Saturday afternoon. Place never got too busy. Wing selection was good, classic hot bone-in wings were by far the best, and Devin our waiter was attentive to our drinks."}
{"text":"The food is horrible the service is just as bad . I've never gone in and been seated at a clean table I have always asked to have my table cleaned after being seated . The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food , and the menu is small . I went 3 times and each time I had buyers remorse. Each time me and the wife said never again but being the kinda people who want to give every place a fair chance this place let us down every time . So that's a wrap for us . 3 strikes you're out"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location! The staff make you feel like family. We especially love the older lady manager - she always makes time for her customers and makes us feel like valued customers. Food is great too. We'll most definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"In spite of how crazy busy the bar area was, we received excellent service from Byron. His recommendations for drink and food were great. It was also nice when manager, Tara, stopped by to check on our dining experience. You can't go wrong with the wings. My apple walnut salad with grilled chicken strips was so good. Had a great dinner! Way to go Native!"}
{"text":"Food was normal sports bar type. What made this place stand out was our server....i cant remember her name but you could see she was over worked and stressed by the manager guy in red yet she remained professional and always alwayws checked on us with a smile."}
{"text":"When did this place turn into a kids karaoke bar ? We used to come here all the time on Saturday nights and have a great time. Now groups of kids sit at tables waiting for their next turn to sing high in their high pitched voices, it's so annoying. Also,  the waiters and waitresses are just hanging out in booths socializing and ignoring their customers. My husband went to the bathroom and came back saying there was a drug deal being done in the bathroom and lines being snorted in the stall. Not going back,  it's a shame."}
{"text":"Chris L was our server tonight.  He was so accommodating, had the best customer service, and was so friendly. :) the food was great also!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I'm new to Yelp but I'm so beyond upset I figured I had to make one. This is the worst service my family and I have ever received. First off our waitress I don't even remember her name I believe it was alexia(brownish/blonde hair) or something, anyway she came to our table after being sat for about 12 mins when it wasn't busy at all than proceeded to tell us how terrible the rest of her tables were just complaining and going on and on finally when she got around to taking our drinks she took forever for 4 drinks. On the other hand the food was decent. Too bad I was three quarters of the way done with my meal when she finally came back to ask if we needed anything which We did because we ran out of ranch. Just terrible terrible service overall. Maybe she didn't pay much attention when being trained or hates it there, but my wife was not happy. My family and I will most likely be taking our service else where in the future."}
{"text":"The nicest most welcoming staff! Thank you Jordan,Samantha, Morgan and Brian!  The pleasure was mine!"}
{"text":"Well, where to start? Go to the one on Power, Tempe, anywhere else but this one..... service was horrendous from the moment we walked in. Hostess didn't seat us. Waitress was snobby from the start like it was a problem we were ready to order so quickly. They gave me the wings my girlfriend ordered and her, my order. Thank the LORD neither of us have allergies. The food was cold and took 25 minutes to get 20 wings and tots. Wings were dry. Took 20 mins to get the bill, pay, receive it back and leave. About an hour total for what could've and should've taken 30 mins. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Super fast, super good, and Katherine is super helpful and sweet.  Thanks to Katherine's great service we will be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place.  Now, I show up for a playoff game and TV'S don't work on the patio, understaffed and HORRIBLE service.  Don't have any reason to recommend anymore.  Don't get me started on the cleanliness of the bathroom."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place, and it was a pretty big restaurant. Half the place was empty when we walked in, and most of the people were near the bar area sitting at high-tops. There are plenty of TV's around with all kinds of sports on. The wings were tasty. They came out pretty quickly too. The waitress was very kind and she did a great job. I could tell that this place can have off-days where the service can be less than stellar. It wasn't that busy and they still seemed to struggle just a bit. But it wasn't enough to call it bad service. It was good service. Will I choose this place over Buffalo Wild Wings next time? Mmmm....maybe, maybe not. I'll pick whichever is closest I guess."}
{"text":"My favorite things at Native are the Strippers, Loaded Tots, and the Pizzuki for dessert. Fun place to hang out and have drinks."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years and years, and over recent years both the service and the food have declined. Every time someone suggests we go I hope the experience is different but it isn't. We won't be spending our money here again."}
{"text":"We had a to go order and the wings looked good! They were still plenty hot when we got them home! They were a bit too salty! But other than that we're good! Great for a quick dinner when in a hurry. Call and order ahead."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the football game and the other times that I have been here their customer service is not that great. They don't seem to care about their customers. I do like the wings but there's times where they don't serve them the way I like them. It is also very cold in here so bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Not the greatest, not the worst.  I had dinner with my girlfriend at this Native location and wanted to watch the ASU game. Our server was a nice girl, she gave us refills in decent time and wasn't pushy about making us order quickly.   We ended up getting the pulled-pork queso and BBQ honey wings. Both were pretty good, although not overwhelmingly great. The TVs were in good locations and we were able to watch the game easily.   This location is in a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking everywhere. There are lots of big groups and families there in the evening, so it does get pretty loud. But in the end, this was a nice Native location."}
{"text":"Honey hot and spicy mustard wings were good, pepperoni pizza delicious! Service was great! All on a Saturday night! Very good choice!"}
{"text":"What happened to Native?  I have been going here since 1990.  The wings are so small and lack meat.  The price is ridiculous $.85/wing.  I went the other day with the family.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"GREAT wing flavors and overall texture in the traditional wings. Unfortunately, the only fresh additions to such deep fried goodness were celery sticks, although our server tried his darndest to track down something else.....no luck with carrots, broccoli, or cucumber....and that was a difficult reality to swallow with this meal.  As for the environment overall, it was clean and well-lit and the staff were all very friendly and seemed to enjoy their workplace. The menu covers quite a few bases, but the wings are a good enough reason to give this chain restaurant a chance."}
{"text":"Gosh this place has gone down hill, and I mean WAAAAAAAAY down!!!  Now i use to live next to the one off Gilbert and went there 2-3 times a week.  The staff knew us and it was still a dive-y establishment, before corporate made everyone remodel and redo the menu, so all locations were the same cookie cutter crap wth no uniqueness to any location.  Stupid decision and to re-do the menu was an even more stupid decision!!!   An before all thus change; they still had NATIVE NACHOS, not these B.S. Buffalo Chicken Nachos.  How can you get rid of the one thing that I loved the most and especially an item that was considered a Native speciality since It did have \"NATIVE\" in the title and a lil chicken speciality sign by it!!.  I want the heaping Native Nachos, not these tiny lame nachos!  Now I'm a nacho connoisseur and those were by far my top choice nachos.  Then they disappeared and I cried for 3 weeks straight.  That whole location changed \"effing corporate\" leave your franchises alone.  Got all bright and non dive like.  Who wants that?  Not me I love my dark, dive-y,  home feeling, comfortable go to restaurant.  So off track....  But back to the location I'm reviewing today, the one off the 17.    First visit: I asked if they could still make the native nachos since I assume they still have all the ingredients, I mean it's pretty simple.  The waitress stared blankly at me like I was asking for something foreign.  I asked long she worked there and she responded a few months.  But i would still imagine she would know about previous items on the menu since I'm sure I'm not the only one asking for them  She said we don't have that and can't make it!  You would think at least someone knew what I was asking for that had worked there for  a few years, but she didn't ask anyone just recommended shit buffalo nachos , and I was no not the same i tried that junk already.   I have had the Native Nachos almost every time I came to Native for 5 years when I lived 2 blocks away.     Beer selection at this location blows, what a joke.  No craft beer......so coors it was.  Only 4 or five watery cheap beers on draft.  Ugh!  The Gilbert and the 60 one had a squared bar in the middle with mostly craft beer (and some junk that snuck in).  I think they had around 16 on tap at least.    Only thing good the 1st time was the drunk lady that bought me a shot because i was the only one listening to her problems. Free shot I'll take it!  Waitress not so good.  Second time, pretty late, maybe an hour and a half before they closed.  Waiter was ok.   Got a Coors.....sigh  Then I asked if I can get different sauces on my wings and he said just 2!?  Well you use to be able to get as many sauces on your wings that you wanted, they came out on individual little pizza like trays and you'd just have them all over your table, and it wasn't a one day thing it was whatever you wanted whenever.  Now I get 2 choices of flavors? LAME.  He said he could bring out the sauce separate for you to try, and then I was thinking if I can have the sauce, why not just put it on 2 of my 6 wings???   Well anyways use to be my favorite restaurant (mostly the gilbert and 60) location.  Good times, just drinking, enjoying the good wings and NACHOS.  Tradition to go after thanksgiving and on Christmas or christmas eve and just get wasted with my brother and husband.  Good times.  Now I have really no reason to go back to any location.  Probably won't unless someone else wants to go there, and I'll sit in disappointment.  Native you are a disappointment in my life, corporate well I could say so many colorful things about you but I won't."}
{"text":"I only ever go when there is some type of sporting event on; and even in the busy times I've never had a problem. Fast food, and quality. If there was ever a problem it was addressed and taken care of. I enjoy being able to take my entire family - even the children to ensure that everyone is able to be included."}
{"text":"I love all natives but this one on signal butte is amazing! Preston tanner and Renee are awesome! Nick the manager is constantly helping, as a fellow server/bartender my boyfriend and i really appreciate all your guys hard work! And food is great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the service is always okay, not excellent, but not terrible. That's fine by me! Their honey hot strippers are amazing! I ordered lunch for pickup and it was ready within like 8 minutes, that's great."}
{"text":"I'm ,a little disappointed the staff is courteous but the service is slow . Been here over 35 minutes we ordered sliders pork and chicken. The place is not as busy now so I don't know what the hold up was. I finally get the food and wow to my amazement the filling on the sandwich is miserable. I will not order this again."}
{"text":"Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy."}
{"text":"I was here before when this place was still Native New-yorker, but now they changed the name to Native Grill & Wings. It was kinda confused to me to get to this place, especially when you travel from the freeway.   However, the dining experience that I had was pleasant. I didn't know Tuesday night is the wing night for 49c/wing with beverages, so it was just my day. I ordered 5 traditional Honey Hot, 5 traditional Asian Garlic, while my friend got the dry dip options for Lemon Pepper and Cheese.  I have to say the Honey Hot flavor was splendid, and the wings came out hot, crispy, and fast. But, celery portion was too small and it was still not a lot when I asked for extra. DON\"T get the Lemon Pepper, it was very salty and didn't taste that good as recommended.   Overall, I think I just found my new favorite spot for Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went here with some friends and family because we saw they had karaoke, after walking in we went into the bar and were sat at the table right by the speakers which was to loud to even think. We were moved tables and treated with nothing but disrespect. The waitress acted as if we were a bother to her and the karaoke wasn't done on a stage it was where you sat. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Took the family to dinner, along with some family friends on a Monday night. The place was slightly busy due to it being a fundraiser for the 100 club.  No wait, straight to our table.   The menu was kinda large with a lot to pick from. The kids menu was basic, same items as most American food restaurants have for dinner.   The wait for dinner was moderate. Once the entrees were delivered, the food was Luke warm. The kids portions were disappointing. The kids Mac and cheese (no side) came in a small gravy dish. The kids sliders okay, but again not very warm.  (We had to order an appetizer to fill the kids up since the portions were so small)  The wife and I ordered wings.  She had the strips while had I the traditional. The traditional wings were good, but cold. The strips were mostly fried batter and not much chicken.   Our waitress was very tentative, but that went away after our entrees were brought to the table. We were sat near the soda fountain machine, so I had to get up and get my refills on two occasions.   It's too bad...."}
{"text":"I've been occasionally going to Native New Yorker establishments since I moved to Phoenix. We decided to try this place, with the name Native, last night. I ordered a Bronx Calzone, my wife ordered a Apple walnut salad and for an appetizer we had the chicken bacon ranch flat bread.   Bronx Calzone - overpowering tomato  flavor. I couldn't taste the peperoni at all. Apple Walnut Salad - they forgot the apples. Flat bread - tasty.  The service was good (Brian). The aesthetics of the place had a slapped together feel, very unlike other Native New Yorker restaurants I've visited. Of the 15-20 televisions only 1 had the coyotes game on, one had the suns game on, and the rest were a mix of golf, car racing, fishing, and boxing - all blaring loud. The noise in what was essentially a  giant room with tables was unsettling.  I cannot recommend going here because I can't see myself going back in the future."}
{"text":"After not being able to think of anything exciting for dinner, my husband and I finally agree to pick up an order from Native. We have been there many times, but mostly order happy hour food/drinks and sit at the bar. Most of the time we have good service and the food is ok. But, tonight we not only received horrible service, but our relatively simple order was messed up. After calling in our order and talking to someone who was confused and seemed like she might have just started today, my husband went to pick up the food. When he got there, no one greeted him or even acknowledged his existence. To make matters worse, a slightly drunk patron was using the restaurant phone to call her husband/boyfriend/significant other and was yelling at him right at the hostess desk. He said that he even had to help move a couple who wanted to switch tables, and stepped up since no one was there to help them. Lol.  Eventually, he got our food-- a Greek grilled chicken salad and some wings-- and headed home. More disappointment :( my salad (which only had a few ingredients) was missing onions, and my husbands wings didn't even have any sauce on them. How do you send out wings with no sauce?! Although Native is the closest restaurant to our house, we probably won't be returning any time soon due to the poor and careless service we received today."}
{"text":"Great job Lindsay... Awesome service thanks for making our Friday night dinner da best.."}
{"text":"Bartenders were great, beer was cold, and it was a lot of fun catching a few March Madness games."}
{"text":"Not too bad that I wouldn't come back! We had Kaitlyn as a server and she did a great job at making sure we were taken care of despite the fact that it did start to get busy!! It did take a bit to get our food (but she did bring my salad out immediately and it was great!), we didn't order anything complex just wings and a 10'' pizza... My boyfriends pizza was hot, probably fresh out of the oven but my wings were on the cooler side .. So probably had been waiting on the pizza. Either way the wings were good but the server definitely made the experience better!!"}
{"text":"We love the wings and pizza here but now we will only order carry out. The service here is ridiculous. We have tried 3 times to come back to see if it was just a bad night. However, every time we come back the service has just gotten worse. Today we walked in to the bar with 5 people at the bar, bartender and I made eye contact and she went and talked to someone at the other end of the bar.  We sat and waited. On the TVs at the bar there were two Michigan vs Penn State TVs, 1 with Nascar, and 2 with baseball. No PAC 10 games. The bartender changed the channel when my husband asked but it's the final straw for us. Buffalo Wild Wings is right around the corner.  Why suffer through poor service?"}
{"text":"Went here with some out of town guests over the weekend.  This place has the absolute slowest service in the entire nation.  We have gone here 3 times since it has opened and terrible each time.  The quality of the food is subpar but has sports bar prices.  The servers are virtually non existent, unless you are ordering from the the bar then they are all over you with constant alcohol flowing.    Save your time and go to Denny's, Fedrico's,  or Firehouse Subs which are in the same shopping area."}
{"text":"Been before and the food was always good and service was just ok. Yesterday my husband and I went, it was packed and we were seated right away. Service was actually awesome and food was good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch, or to catch a game. They have specials everyday and lots of TVs. A huge variety of different sauces and dry rubs for their famous wings. I love their happy hour food and drink specials"}
{"text":"they have really good wings. good service and good tv to watch. I recommend to all of there looking for a good bar and grill"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday at 1pm. Place wasn't busy at all since its past lunch time. We got the Buffalo Chicken Nachos for $9.99 and they weren't worth that much. It would have been better if the chicken was shredded instead of small cubes. Also the nachos would be better with cheese layered instead of all on top (The tortilla chips below were lonely).  I ordered a pound of the boneless wings in Strawberry Hot and Asian Garlic. The Strawberry sauce was meh and needed some kick. The boneless wings reminded me of Tyson Any'Tizers chicken nuggets. The breading was all soggy and slimy from the sauce without any crunch. I was a little dissapointed.  Husband got the all meats pizza and said the pizza was good. It was in the medium range on a scale of bad pizza to the best pizza he's ever eaten.  The waitress we had was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the servers were nice but it definitely wasn't the greatest experience I've had. They have lots and lots of TVs to distract you from whatever conversation your having and the bar is way too dark! so dark that it is impossible to even see your food. Servers are nice but seemed very inexperienced. all in all it was pretty decent and good for a lunch trip with some friends."}
{"text":"Several ordered items were forgotten and had to be asked for again. One order of wings came out cold and then they forgot to bring them back out."}
{"text":"Incompetent manager and supervision. They have zero experience running  a facility and it shows. Food is slow to come out and the manager seems to love spending time jaw jacking while making customers wait to be seated in an empty restaurant. I feel so sorry for the staff its obvious they are doing their best and trying to work around the problems. The food took forever to come out and it arrived cold. The beer on tap arrived way over filled with foam (means the kegs are too hot). With poor leadership the ship sinks! The only reason they have any business is because its the only place in town to eat besides Denny's and Cracker Barrel. Don't wast you time here you could drive to Litchfield or Goodyear and still be seated faster than this place."}
{"text":"Good service but the wings are so oily. We used 10 napkins to squeeze the oil out of these things.   Maybe stand these things up and let them drain."}
{"text":"Been here a couple a couple times and it's a pretty good sports bar with Ok food. I like the flavor choices for the wings but they are not as good as they used to be. You can get far better wings up the road at Teakwoods. Their pizza is decent. It tastes really good but I'm not a huge fan of the floppy style thin pizza. Just my preference though. I will give at least them 3 stars though for having good servers, NTN trivia and good draft beer choices. They will remain in my local trivia round of bars that I visit."}
{"text":"Just got off work and stopped in for dessert having the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie and an oatmeal raisin cookie these are so delicious    By the way they make an orange milkshake it is so good Kari the manager makes them so good   Thank you Kari for always making it a pleasurable experience keep up the great work.   You rock Kari and Emily   The service is always excellent  Management is always making sure everything is excellent   Thank you Kari Dustin Katie Emily and John keep up the great work    Also I tip my hat to the Teddy the bartender    I love coming here the entire staff is so friendly"}
{"text":"This place was once a good spot now they serve soggy pizza and cold wings. service is not great i just waited 45 minutes with 4 tables full. Don't go if your hungry."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in this location. We were seated then preceded to wait for about 30 minutes before we were served. And when we did get served we had to asked to get served...we ordered drinks that came out water downed and they didn't even have the ability to make basic drinks...the management was rude and the over all experience didn't go well."}
{"text":"Native used to be go to place for my late night snack. I always got a pound of the medium boneless wings... I always get it to go because their service is always bad. But the boneless wings 5/5!!! Anyways an atrocity happened.... I came back from winter break craving the pound of boneless medium wings I usually get and these people changed the batter of the wings on me. THEY CHANGED THE BATTER! It's awful and too soggy and sweet and awful. And I'm sad because they were the only good boneless wings in a mile radius from me. The service was already bad but I'm sad to say the wings are now bad too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I arrived hoping to get a quick dinner before having to meet with a friend that evening. Our server comes and tells us her name, and that she'll be bar tending and serving us tonight. I didn't see any other servers on the floor. There was a manager there who had a laptop set up and was sitting at a table nearby. I ordered a meatball sub, and my girlfriend order a medium Native burger. 25 minutes later, after we revived one drink, and no check ups from the manager, again sitting near by, or our server, our food finally arrives. The sub was soggy like it was sitting in a window waiting for the burger to be finished, and the \"medium\" burger clearly well done. I understand our bartender may have been busy, that's understandable, however the manager on duty, I watched him pull his phone and take pictures to show the staff while laughing with them, joking around with the servers who were cut, and staying by the front door. All the while my girlfriend and I were running late and just wanted our food. All in all, it was the only time I can truly remember having bad service. I've had \"Okay\" service sure, but this was hands down bad. I manage a restaurant myself, and I felt what I observed was awful service. Even if given a free meal, I sincerely doubt I will take my business to Native grill and Wings. Denny's is next door, and you get better food and faster service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, even on weekends. They offer a variety of flavors on traditional wings, boneless wings, and grilled strips which should please anyone in your party. The pizzas is good, but can be crisper to make it better. There are plenty of TV's, perfect for catching the game. The traditional hot wings are great. If you want a nice site down place to enjoy great wings, stop on by."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner tonight at the Native New Yorker very much! The restaurant just opened this week so there are some kinks in the service and the kitchen that need to be worked out but boy howdy the food was pretty darn good! It was served at the right temps, our drinks were kept fairly full, and the wait staff was falling all over each other to help.   Because there was quite a crowd tonight, service was a bit slow. It took quite a while for our appetizers to come out and when we would ask our server to bring something to us, he would disappear...and only reappear when he had another reason to come back to our table or the others in his station. I realized that what he was trying to do was be efficient in his trips, but he did have a trainee with him who he could have delegated these things to so that we wouldn't be sitting and waiting for extra dressing or ketchup or silverware. It's a kink to be worked out tho.  Another issue I noticed was that the kitchen didn't make the dishes to specs. For example, on the menu the kids sliders indicated there would be cheese and pickles on the sliders. There were no pickles. My MILs salad was to include croutons and there were no croutons (and not NEARLY enough dressing either but that's another issue) That having been said...for kids sliders these were AWESOME! They aren't slider size tho--rather they are more like McDonalds cheeseburger size! They are pretty big for sliders. They are served on a pretzel bun too! I KNOW--fancy schmancy for kids sliders. But again...if you say on the menu that it comes with pickles..make sure you serve to specs.   I had the skinny chicken lettuce wraps which were excellent. I thought it was interesting to serve on romaine versus iceberg lettuce but it worked itself out. My husband had fish and chips and really enjoyed. I LOVED how the coleslaw was made per order versus just made that day and left to sit and wilt. My son had a burger as well that was really great and my FIL had a calzone which he loved.  I will DEFINITELY be back to Native New Yorker. I think they did a very good job considering this is first week opening. I think (hope) it will only get better and not disappoint! They will be a nice addition to the middle of Surprise. :)"}
{"text":"First time at this Native. Arrived for lunch at 12:35 and it was half full. Spring Training on the tubes plus Sweet 16 was on later. I waited 10 mins for a table anyway. Then I waited 12 for a server to say hi. Terrible service for a half full restaurant. It was pleasant service, once he arrived.   Didn't see any lunch specials like at other Natives, so I ordered 12 wings, fries and an iced tea for $21.69. Much steeper than Wing Stop.   My meal arrived in 6 mins.   My wings were hot and plump. The Salt and Vinegar wings were excellent. S&V is a dry rub, and they coated the chicken thoroughly. The Hot wings were supposed to be sauced but only one of the six had 'sauce' along with the flavor. The others were closer to a dry rub than sauce.   The fries were exceptional. They battered, fried and then heavily seasoned them.   It wasn't a horrible lunch, just disjointed."}
{"text":"went there last night to celebrate a friends birthday and watch the game.  atmosphere was great.  the suicide wings sucked...was mild sauce with red pepper flakes.  is the kitchen that lazy?...red pepper flakes??? wtf.  decided on doing a couple shots of jameson....and the shit was completely watered down...same with the petron. as far as the price....it seemed a little high..but then again...so was i. oh well....not saying you should avoid this place but i sure as hell am."}
{"text":"Love the bar. This is my local watering hole. Two minutes from my house. James and Renee know our drinks. They are seasoned and fast professionals. Always consistant. Great TVs everywhere, video poker by buzzfeed and good food."}
{"text":"The grilled honey hot wings are the best wings I've ever had!! Recommend...a must try!!"}
{"text":"I have come here quite a few times with friends who love hot wings.  I am not a hot wing person, but the menu is enormous and lots to choose from.  I have never been disappointed with the food... it is your typical bar food pizza, burgers, sliders, sandwiches, and many other things.  My only complaint is we sat on the patio and it smelled like a sewer out there.  I don't recall this being a issue before... so not sure if this is a problem that can be resolved or only going to get worse.  My suggestion... if you are going there and want to sit on the patio... sit as far to the east as possible.  It didn't smell as much over there:)"}
{"text":"Update on last review.....happy to say the wings have come out correctly as ordered and the pizza seems to be better tasting. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I went to this location about 3 weeks ago and had a horrible experience. Soggy, flavorless \"Asian\" salad which was Asian in name only. (I'm still wondering what made it Asian?)Anyway, the service was slow, the food was subpar, and we waited LITERALLY 25 minutes for the check. Then we finally just went to the checkout desk and after the girl ignored us for another 5 minutes, she told us (rudely) that we'd have to wait for our own server to check us out. Another 5 minutes later we finally get checked out. I didn't want to be a public complainer, so I went to their website and complained there. NO RESPONSE, NADA. Soooo, here we are. Thank you Native. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS \"BUSINESS\""}
{"text":"The service was good. The food came out pretty quick.  I really love the wings, they were crunchy and the sauce that was on it didn't over power the chicken. The unsweetened mango tea was especially good and very refreshing!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this place 1 star is because my waiter was decent (barely).   It honestly makes me sad to see locally owned restaurants with exquisite cuisine go out of business, while chains that only care about revenue and nothing about food, thrive.  My bf and I were starving so we ordered tons of wings, pizza and pulled pork sliders.  Let me just say, we waited appx. 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even busy. Okay , I am an adult so I can wait, I have patience. What I can't handle is waiting 40 minutes for food and have it completely cold! As if it was made 40 minutes ago and was just sitting in the back.    I always take pictures when I go out to eat, but this food wasn't even worth the flash. Both my boyfriend and I were so annoyed that we left without finishing our food. A rarity.  Overall: WILL NEVER RETURN. I only wish this place on my worst enemies :)"}
{"text":"I went there expecting to use a groupon that I purchased. I specifically asked the waitress twice whether or not the Groupon could be used on their daily specials. I was reassured twice that I definitely could.   After ordering and eating my food, I was notified that my bill would either be $14.00 more and I could use the Groupon or I could pay them directly for the billed amount. This was very disappointing.   On the other hand, the food was good and the service was great despite the miscommunication. I was very disappointed that they would not honor the groupon despite their mistake though."}
{"text":"The 1 star is for the food the 4 missing is for the crappy service! I love the wings but they shorted me 4 wings, the server checked on our table maybe 3x, I asked for water and she took the cup and didn't come back! My husband had to get up and got get a cup of water himself. We asked for our check and it took her 15 minutes to bring over and didn't come back for another 15 minutes, didn't even get a pen to sign the check. The entire time she seemed like she hated her job and was here just for a check. Horrible service."}
{"text":"All around worst dining experience that I have had in a long time. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Slowest service I have ever had. The server was alright the few times we saw him. The food was absolutely horrendous. We had to send back the spinach dip because it was so salty. Our entrees were just as awful. Will NEVER return. Don't waste your money here when there are a lot of great options in surprise."}
{"text":"Wow. What a disappointment.  All my family and friends warned me how bad this place was, but since it's the only pizza restaurant close to my work I decided to try it.  The pizza is abysmal and for $1.29 per topping I should get more than 4 freaking mushrooms on it! I don't need to be a food critic to know this is a RIP OFF. So bad."}
{"text":"We stopped here to get a \"quick\" bite to eat before seeing movie. We had an hour to spare. We got sat, 20 minutes later they took our drink and food order. About 30 minutes later I asked to cancel our food order it was taking so long, they finally brought it out. It was mediocre at best. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here after trying to get in at Tim Finnegan's across the street for St. Patty's Day (what a joke - $10 cover charge just to eat?) so the girlfriend suggested wings as an alternative to corned beef n' cabbage.  The place is newly remodeled and the biggest, sports bar-iest Native I've ever seen. Service was slow and I don't know why because it wasn't busy. Like, at all. So, minus one star.  No specials on Guinness for St. Patty's Day either? Not only that, but one bottle is six frickin' bucks? For that price I'd better be getting a reach-around from a cute Irish lass, too. One happy hour margarita, my Guinness, wings for the two of us, plus tax & tip, came to . . . wait for it . . . $53.00! My name must be Seamus O'Fuckme because I could have gone to Bluewater Grill for fresh seafood for the same price. And the only reason why I ordered as many wings as I did is because they're the smallest wings on the planet. I swear, pigeons have more robust flappers than these sorry excuses they call chicken wings. So, minus two stars for all that shizz.  Won't be going back. Hooters AND Buffalo Wild Wings are right across the freeway. I don't like Hooters wings but no one goes to Hooters for the food, now do they?"}
{"text":"My boss, in his infinite wisdom, decided to compete in the Battle of the Bone wing eating contest.  So, in a show of support, wearing custom T-shirts that proudly proclaimed \"Team Guza\" we descended on the poor, unsuspecting Native.  Normally, Native is a place I can take or leave....but I have to say this one really did a great job.  They were busy and crowded, KUPD and the Bud Light girls were running around, there were people everywhere, yet our server managed to keep up despite being clearly understaffed.  I ordered a burger and fries, and of course it came while the wing eating was happening.  Now, maybe it was flavored by hunger and the thrill of watching grown men stuff pounds of wings into their gullet, but even cold, that was one terrific burger.  Even the rapidly cooling fries were awesome.  Sad to say, the food was the highlight, as my boss was soundly beaten, coming in 7th out of 9 - he did manage to eat 1 lb 7oz of wings, which makes me just a little queasy.    This was the best experience I've ever had at a Native,and would be willing to come back to this one again."}
{"text":"I frequent this particular NNY and I've never had a bad time...food is pretty good for what it is..and that's BAR FOOD...everyone I've encountered has been friendly and its a great place for cheap beer and to hang out and watch sports"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a zero? Absolute worst service. Took more than an hour to get our food and when we got it was cold. Then i check my card and was over charged. Don't dare order a beer. Took the server 30mins to bring back to the table. My advice treat your customers with respect. If you continue to employ assholes as severs, you'll get asshole customers."}
{"text":"I used to love going to the location on the I17 and Bell Road, especially when they had their Tuesday wing specials. My BF and I used to share an antipasto salad and get 2 dozen wings plus beer and leave feeling stuffed with money still left in our pockets. I no longer live in AZ but recently went back for a business trip and was craving my usual meal, so we went to this location. The salad was about half the size it used to be, but the wings were pretty much the same. The biggest difference was obvious when the bill came. It was $50 for 2 dozen wings, a salad and a couple of $3 beers! Whaaaaa? They charge almost a dollar per wing! I realize it wasn't Tuesday night when the wings are on special (.60/wing isn't exactly cheap either, though), but MY GOD! Last I checked wings are the junkiest part of the chicken...when did they turn into gold? Throw about 3 cents worth of sauce on it and charge almost $1? I don't think so. This place was so much better before locations started popping up all over the place and they changed the name. Now they think they are all corporate and fancy. Not so much, people. And the real kicker? We were both sick all night because of whatever they served us. Needless to say, my wing days are over until I find a place that doesn't try to rob me blind."}
{"text":"Used to be THE place for Buffalo style wings when they were \"Native New Yorker\". Now they've cleaned up, changed to Native Grill, and gone corporate. Gone are the days of nickel wings and $1 beers. Used to have just the classics: Buffalo mild, medium, hot - and 'suicide' for those wanting inferno heat. Now they have 20 flavors of spice from mild to extreme heat, sweet to BBQ to just plain spicy. Also, lots of other items on the menu like pasta, pizza...typical sports bar fare. Food and service is okay for that late dinner or mid-afternoon lunch. I wouldn't go out of my way like I used to, for NNY wings and beer. But will still come back out of nostalgia for extra crispy (well done) battered wings with traditional hot buffalo sauce. RIP, NNY! We miss ya!"}
{"text":"The wings were just fine, but the restaurant seemed dirty.  The floor was sticky, the tables had not been cleaned, and the whole place smelled like stale beer.  I wasn't looking for fine dining, but I was looking for a place that looks like it passed it's health inspection.  I don't think I will be returning on my next trip."}
{"text":"Great place to stop after work and have a few drinks and food with friends... great atmosphere, bar food is decent, wouldve given 5 stars but 2 of the 3 bartenders arent good, the other 1 with the black and purple hair is great! Karaoke night is also a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeted right away. However it took our waitress forever to come to actually take our order. Our drink order arrived wrong, but our waitress  quickly fixed it. The food was okay I had the wing sampler the ranch dressing was a little sketchy had some kind of film on it. We also had the fish I would not recommend it it's smelled fishy and didn't taste that great was over fried and greasy."}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time today. The chicken and waffle wings are really good. I didn't think we would like them, but they have good flavor. The server Amber made our experience a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Beautiful new building. Parking lot was full when we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Wednesday. Our party of 6 included 2 young teens & 4 adults. Although the restaurant  was pretty full, I thought the food service was very slow. It took nearly an hour for our meals to arrive. The server told us that they were waiting for the chicken pot pie and that was holding up the order. Once the food arrived the pot pie was still cold in the center and was sent back. I had a pound of boneless wings & although the flavor was good they were over cooked & lukewarm when arrived. I also had a plate of loaded french fries that were also lukewarm. My wife had a pasta dish from the \"Under 500 calorie\" Skinny Menu but the only reason it was under 500 calories was because of how small the portion was. My wife is not a big eater by any means and this was the first time I ever saw her leave a restaurant hungry. The teens had a pizza and liked it so that earns the one star. Not sure if it was the servers mistake or a cooking issue why this food took so long to arrive & showed up cold but the beverage service was good (we were all drinking soft drinks with multiple refills). After the meal we ordered a coffee which took them forever to  brew up and unfortunately tasted awful. None of the 4 adults in our party have any desire to return to this place."}
{"text":"The best part of this visit was our server, Diane. She was very friendly and the smile made us feel happy and welcome. This was the special wing day. Every Tuesday wings are 59 cents. As usual the wings were done correctly an d the selected sauces were good. Wing were meaty and not overdone.  In the past the wings at Native were smaller on the special wing days. It was a pleasure to see that they recognized their error and brought back the regular wings for Tuesdays.   Bar was clean and well stocked. Thanks to Diane I give this Native 4 stars.  A server can make or break a venue."}
{"text":"Have been eating at this location on Tuesday nights for over a year. Tuesday was wing night and wings were 30 cents each for a limited time during their anniversary celebration. They eventually raised the price to 49 cents each. Prior to this celebration period the wings were a reasonable medium size. After the celebration period and when they increased the price, the wings were very small. I even joked to my waitress that it must have been difficult to find all of these pigeon legs. On one occasion I had a wing that was only a small piece of meat. Our group of Tuesday night eaters have since quit going to Native wings because of this change. Their other menu items are good, but , when you bill yourself as a Wing House they need to be the best item on the menu. By changing the size of the wings they have cheapen the total restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm...margarita on the rocks...mmmmmmmmmm!  Went in here for HH one Friday night and ordered a regular margarita on the rocks and loved every sippage second of it!  On this particular visit I ordered the wedge salad and thought it was pretty tasty too.  Did I mention that their margarita was really good?  It def was not out of a machine (Macayos...ahem!)."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! First time here so I decided to try native strippers, figured can't go wrong with those. When I got my strips, after about 40 minutes of waiting, not only were they cold but they hardly had any sauce on them. Of course I sent them back because who wants cold food. When I received my \"new\" strips they looked like my old ones just warmed up with a few new strips. The waitress told me they gave me \"extra sauce\" because they looked a little bare. After everything I wasn't even impressed with the food or the service. If I can give zero stars I would. Will not be returning back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. Location is understaffed, bartender had to come from the behind the bar to seat us. The few servers they had were running around trying to serve eveyone there which didn't give the time to tend to the partons as well as they should have. While I've been back several times for the food, the service is very slow."}
{"text":"Every minute I was there, I liked this place less and less.  First of all, arriving at a typical lunch hour should mean I would be greeted by a host or hostess.  None around.  So we seat ourselves and I pick up a few menus.  There is almost no one there, even customers.  Here's a pro tip - if you want sauce on your wings, you have to ask for them \"saucy.\"  Which I didn't think about since the menu says in Big Bold Letters \"there will be sauce.\"  It lies.  At one point, I reordered a wing for having too little sauce.  I was charged again, but ok, fine, I got to enjoy a ghost pepper wing.  Ghost pepper to them must mean something else.  It was hot, don't get me wrong, but it was about a standard wing \"hot\" instead of the hottest pepper \"hot.\"  Towards the end of the meal, my friend pulled a hair out of a wing, so he stopped eating.  The waitress asked about it, so I mentioned he found a hair, but not even an apology occurred.  As we left, we decided never to go back.  (I gave an extra star because I did learn now to order the wings \"saucy\" so that was kinda my fault.)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times,  but it seems thec quality of the food continues to decrease along with the service.   The waitress was very nice,  but it seemed like we interrupted the hostess when we first arrived.   For the food, the wings have gotten so small that the container of ranch was bigger than the drumsticks.   Not sure how often we will be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have karaoke, trivia, free poker, great food, and an awesome staff! I'm a regular there and love all the servers and bartenders they rock! Liv is the best!"}
{"text":"I don't exactly enjoy Arizona.... But my business trip has been much more pleasant than expected. A big part of this is this place, which is conventiently a stone's throw from my hotel. I loved the boneless wings, the cookie dessert, but most of all the beautiful service from Victoria and supervisor Nathan. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My family went to the Native in Ahwatukee first, but there was a party of 25. Since it would take awhile to get a table, we decided to come to this location instead. I really wish we didn't after all. We were seated, told \"Ricky\" would be our server. Waited a few minutes, then the manager took our drink order. We received our drinks, it took atleast 10-15min for someone to come back. We basically didn't have a server. Then \"Ricky\" takes our order,  (12 Wings, 1/2boneless, dinner salad, loaded tots (NO SOUR CREAM) as the appetizer). He takes our order and doesn't come back for a loooonggg time. He keeps checking on other tables, but would make eye contact with us. But completely neglect  us. So our food comes out, the appetizer and our entrees. I didn't receive my dinner salad, the Loaded tots had sour cream. Had to send them back. At this point we were just pissed off. Isn't an appetizer supposed to come out before your entrees???! We were pretty much done eating by the time the tots came out. Still no dinner salad either. We spoke with the manager and he took the loaded tots off our bill. We have had such bad service at Native and I do not understand why. Drove to this location for terrible service. Appreciate the manager coming over, but no apologies for the service we received. Pretty disappointed.!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have given this location too many chances. We dined in on August 17 around 8pm. Food was good, our server was really nice. But then I wake up at 5am the next day, with the worst pain in my stomach. That's right, FOOD POISONING!!! This is the 2nd time this has happened. I will NEVER GIVE THIS LOCATION MY BUSINESS AGAIN."}
{"text":"Wings were pretty good, everything else was just OK.  I'd be much happier with this place, however, if they showed the UFC events.  I've asked several times (in person and over the phone) and each time was told they don't like the UFC and don't consider it a legitimate sport.  Just about every other NATIVE in town does , as well as all their competitors.   ...minus a couple of stars for that..."}
{"text":"I am beyond disappointed in this location.  We ordered take-out. The lady on the phone was very pleasant. I was excited to order my food, I eat healthy ALL week and I literally look forward to my cheat meal... And when I get to my cheat meal, I hope it will be darn good one ya know? I ordered an Asian Chicken Salad - supposedly one of \"Native's Favorites\"... I went home and opened my bag and its literally soup. I'm so upset. I love food. And when you are excited to go home and eat something you wanted and its 110% not what you expected... It's kind of awful. I couldn't eat it. The lettuce was soggy, warm and wilty. I couldn't believe they sent someone home with this mess. I can't help but wonder if they actually would serve someone this nasty \"salad\"dining in at the restaurant or from reading other reviews - if this place just stinks. Sorry but it's not cool. This is gross."}
{"text":"We had not been here in a while, and we decided to go back and give it a try on New Year's Day for dinner. It was pretty disappointing.  I used to order a sandwich that was like a french dip on a roll with caraway seeds on it and was disappointed that it is not on the new menu, but it got me to try something else. I ordered the chicken stripper plate with the new chicken and waffles rub. The chicken was good and I like the sweet flavor (our server Jackie gave me a good heads up to expect it to be sweet), but along side the 3 mid sized tenders was a small handful of fries.  My husband a special chicken sandwich that was a limited time only special and he too got a small handful of fries on the side. His sandwich was just OK. Fries are super cheap - I don't know why they are being so tight with them. They were pretty yummy fries though.  We both agreed that the portion sizes are much smaller than they used to be and were just unimpressed with the food. There was nothing wrong with the prep - it was as we ordered, and served hot, but it just didn't meet the high expectations we had become accustomed to.  I do want to say that our server Jackie was doing a great job and we have no complaints about her."}
{"text":"2nd time here for happy hour and food. We tried the 2 for $20 this time. Got the grilled chicken apple and strawberry salad. It's pretty good. My tall draft beer is nice and cold. Just moved here to Phoenix and will be around this place again to watch some games. They have a nice bar area with plenty of tv screens."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Native.... As long as I'm able to sit in the lounge area. They have the best bar tenders and servers and I enjoy the food also. I will say that on the occasion I come here with my kids and have to sit in the restaurant side the service is less then average."}
{"text":"One word ....sucks just stay away you will be better off driving to a different native .."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time tonight.  I had the California Chicken sandwich and substituted the broccoli for the fries  The chicken sandwich was excellent,  very tasty.   However the broccoli was very bland like it was washed under hot water and served.   It definitely could have used a step up or two in flavor.     For dessert I got a piece of  cheesecake to go with strawberries.   It was a good portion,  but just average in flavor.   However, they did't pack any plastic wear or napkins with it which I would assume there would be with a to go order."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of chicken wings and had always heard good things about the wings at native. I decided to give them a try when bringing food to a friend's party. Once I got there, I saw that my order was short one dozen wings. They assured me that my name would be put on a list and my wings would be refunded the next time I went in there.   I gave them another shot when I had to bring food to a potluck at work. Once I got there, I let them know that my name was on the list because my order was not correct before. The person working there informed me that no such list existed. Then, the manager accused me of trying to steal wings from them, implying that I could not afford the extra dozen wings.  As far as the food went, the wings were honestly so so. The parmesan wings were not bad, but very greasy. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I go there for my after work fix, beer and chicken wings. I've never had an issue with the service, wings always come out great and I usually take advantage of their daily specials. My buddy and I are patiently waiting for it to open back up."}
{"text":"super chill place with so many yummy wings!! They have so many different types that I get to pig out on. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"5 star service. 3 Star food. Wings are pretty much standard wings that everyplace has. Boneless are out of a bag and overbreaded. Reasonable prices. Nice atmosphere. Service was great the whole time. Too bad the food is forgettable. Beer list is light and filled with corporate beers. Would like to see a local chain focus on the local great beers out there versus the big beer garbage. Might give it another shot given the shortage of wing places."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this! Tenille Always makes us feel like we just walked in on the set of Cheers. What a great place to celebrate the first Thursday of the week. TNF, Tenille providing Exceptional service  (honestly we come back because we're so well looked after) and great food. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Setting: Saturday evening - a little early for dinner but my son had skipped lunch playing at his friend's. It was barely 5:00.  First strike. We waited 5 mins even though more than half the tables were empty. We should've been seated immediately. The man behind me asked, \"Really? We have to wait and there's 10 tables ready right now?!?!\" The hostess said something about new wait staff coming on and she wasn't sure who was assigned to which tables .. something like that.  2nd strike. After we were seated, we waited another 5+ mins for a wait person to appear. I had to ask her for a kid's menu.   All I ordered was a drink and the kid ordered some wings.   I sipped at my margarita and almost gagged. It was like I had ordered a large SALT WATER. Looking at the bottom of the glass, there was a pile of salt clearly visible. GROSS! Now I know the rim usually has salt around it but I've never had a margarita with salt actually in the drink. It was awful. 3rd strike.   I had to ask the waitress to take the drink off the bill. The glass was still full and I lifted it to show her all the salt in the bottom. No apology. She acted like that was no big deal.   But she did take it off the bill.   Learned my lesson. Won't return. NYPD Pizza is closer to me anyway."}
{"text":"Order fried fish was not good at all tonight very wet and not crisp also ordered the az burger was very dry again two bites of sauce on it even order extra sauce never received it."}
{"text":"Alright, I see a lot of crummy reviews here and I have one thing to say...you really have to know what to come here for, and that is for the wing special. I'm talkin' Tuesdays and Thursdays, getting your butt there semi early and eating wings for cheap. This is yet again one of those places that does one thing well, and when exploited properly, will leave you with nothing to really complain about. The best wings in the house have to be the hot, teriyaki and the suicide wings. I've very rarely had a bad experience with the food, but I will agree that the service can be meh at times, but that's probably because the place is packed with loud and obnoxious college kids most nights. So, if you want a cold beer and some great wings for cheap, Native might be a spot for you on a Tuesday or Thursday night. If you're expecting fine New York dining, you probably want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service at this location is always sub par; I'm not sure why we tried it again.  I ordered traditional wings and got served mini KFC drumsticks without any sauce.  When I asked to send them back because I miss understood what they thought \"traditional hot wings\" were they argued with me about it.  Not just one person, but 3; at separate times.  They did finally replace the offending pollo, but it still wasn't awesome.  Sad to say I won't be going back to Native for wings anymore....and that's what they're \"known for\"."}
{"text":"Got a to go order of 3 lbs of boneless wings. Got home and realized every single one of them were burnt. I'm not upset that they were burnt because everyone makes mistakes. It's just the fact that whoever gave them to me didn't check and be sure the wings were acceptable. Either they didn't make sure or did and took advantage of the fact that it was a to go order and knew I wouldn't check every single thing on the spot. I have been to several natives to eat there and have never been served this. Very disappointed they even allowed this to leave the kitchen.   UPDATE: They got back to me to about this to make it right so thank you so much for it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for while and i am still going once a week for almost the past 10 years. Changed hands i think a few times but the staff and remodel are amazing.The food itself is what you craze when you think of wings, worl famouse!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from them through GrubHub. Food never came. Recieved an email at midnight that irder was cancelled. Called Yelp/GrubHub to see why order was cancelled and she stated the driver went to the restaurant and they cancelled the order because it wasn't ready. It was already late so I didnt have the time to order from someone else. So just sitting here waiting for norning to roll around so I cam eat."}
{"text":"I had a poor customer service experience here. I placed a to go order and the person taking that order was rude and short. After every item I ordered they tried to hang up and they forgot to take my name. When I went to pick up the food, my order was incorrect and I waited for an hour. I asked to speak to the manager and he asked me \"What do you want me to do?\" This in itself was rude enough. I explained to him that I don't want him to do anything because I'm not combine back"}
{"text":"Just left horrible food poor service  no co2 no blender and manager just did not try to satisfy a party 8 never again.  No lights in parking lot while night was a disaster"}
{"text":"Oh where to begin? The food was OK, average, forgettable. We had 3 different servers by the time we ordered. Maybe the guy was new but the food took forever to arrive. We had one refill of drinks, weren't checked on and had to flag him down for the multiple missing and/incorrect items ordered. He was pleasant but that's about all I can say. We asked if there were substitutes for fries, and thus ordered the tater tots, after confirming there wasn't anything on them. Then they come out loaded with cheese, sour cream, bacon and onions. None of which we wanted. To top it off, we were charged $2 extra and weren't told there was an extra charge. The bill was wrong on top of that charge so we didn't dispute the $2 but it was reflected in the tip.    My husbands burger was meh. The lettuce was literally one very thin piece of square lettuce. Seriously?!? Even fast food places give you lettuce!  The cherry on top of this dinner was we were seated in the central Hub,where you can watch all the servers congregate, talk, sometimes bicker and clearly not serve their customers.   In summary - we came because of a free birthday meal - Decided to give them another try even though we didn't remember loving the food. I'll unsubscribe from any further offers. I don't ever want to be tempted to come here again.    I can't believe we paid for all the empty calories of bland food we just consumed."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Arizona and my second time coming to this restaurant and I was a little disappointed.  There were 3 big parties so the waitress and waiters were all over the place. Understandable but we felt a bit neglected and rushed.  Then we waited and waited for our food. Finally we got our food and mine was on point! Delicious, tender, juicy and just well roasted. But then they forgot about us. We wanted water and a dessert menu. We asked someone to help us and they said they will be right over, 10 minutes later nothing. Finally we just took our cards out and gave it to the next waitress that passed by and just said \"charge it please\". You guys were great until it got busy. I guess they are not use to that. It was bittersweet."}
{"text":"Wife decided she wanted wings and being close to the house we tried it out.  Place was packed, short on staff so we waited a while for drinks and food...but it was a kid free night and we were not in a hurry.  I am not particularly a fan of wings but I liked the honey and barbecue wings.  Really liked their fries also.  I'll definitely be coming here again if I'm not in a hurry.  Wife's review: I agree with the hubby's review however, I would like to add to his comments.  The manager did notice the lack of service and was very helpful in assuring that service was improved by taking our orders himself.  With his advice, we added the battered fries to our usual BBQ, garlic Parmesan and medium flavored wings.  Absolutely the best fries I have ever had!  I definitely recommend them.  I enjoyed their wings but I am more partial to wet sauce than dry rub!"}
{"text":"Wow. That's all I can say. Went here feeling like a peasant and left feeling like a king. The service provided to me by Seth was incomprehensible. I've never been catered to so well, and I didn't expect it coming here. I honestly thought it would be the standard run-of-the-mill wing and beer stop, but I was happily surprised.  But enough gloating, let's cover the the important stuff.  My server was Seth, the bartender was Ryley, I think? Both very friendly and personable, had a lot of knowledge about their food and liquor selection. Loaded up on some awesome wings, and fantastic tasting drink.  Super satisfied customer, and will definitely be back with the boys for drinks if Ryley (Riley?) is tending the bar."}
{"text":"Normally, I Love Native, but this must have been an off night for the Native, because I didn't like anything about the night. Rude non attentive waiter(can't tell you his name because he never told us). The fish(which I went in for), was not very tasty(it wasn't a Friday, so I guess that makes a difference on how the fish should taste?). Drinks tasted watered down and my beer wasn't cold. Just a bad night all around. But I Love the Native so I will give them another chance!!"}
{"text":"Average food. The wings are probably my favorite. The fries were good as well. Been here twice. Great customer service. Lots of televisions to look at. It's consistently busy everytime I have gone in. If you are looking for a cheap good place to eat then this would be it."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  Lately started to decline in quality  Last two times I been there, my wings looked like leftovers from 3 days ago.  Extremely hard on the outside to the point where you can't eat them and chewy on the inside.  I go there when is not busy and still , they always forget to refill the soda. Everything just takes forever. Manager is nice, too bad he doesn't have the adequate staff."}
{"text":"Well if you like dry meats and extra charges then this is the place to go. Oh and I hope you like cafeteria flavoring or should I say no flavor then you will feel right at home."}
{"text":"This place totally sucks when it comes to customer service.  Went there with a buddy tonight for dinner at 10:25pm...working late.  After we were sat down the server told us that they we're only serving wings and appetizers.  Ok, so we ordered our drinks.  When she brought our drinks she then told us that we can only order fried items and no flat breads.  Mind you, they say they are open until 11pm.  If you don't want to cook after 10pm then close at 10pm.  I was pissed!!!  Went to Native Grill but couldn't order anything from the grill.  Just doesn't make sense.  We just left!!!  I do not recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so we came in on a Thursday night. It was slow and still took 20 minutes for us to get sat at a table.  I really wish we wouldn't have waited. Our server forgot to bring silverware, so we didn't have silverware for about 25 minutes after we were sat.  SLOW service. No refills unless we flagged her down. The food was meh.  If you look at my reviews I'm very fair.  I don't like giving places bad reviews, but this place was just horrible. We spoke to the manager and he gave us a \"discount\"... 7 dollars off a 72 dollar check. Might as well not even bother. Way to offend us.  We will definitely not be back.  Not worth the time, the money, nothing."}
{"text":"We ate here a few months ago and it was so-so. We thought we'd give them another try and found out that sub-par food and sub-par service is the norm. We were there on a Friday evening at 5:15, so no waiting for a table. We asked for a booth but were told none were available, we could see three from the hostess bar, but settled for a table.  It was 10 minutes before our server arrived to take our drink order, a Coke, 2 teas one sweet one unsweetened. The Coke was undrinkable, and we received 2 sweet teas. We got the drinks squared away and ordered the Antipasto salad $9.99 and a large sausage, mushroom, onion pizza $23.  While waiting I observed food being served to the wrong tables, food being returned, and wrong drink orders. Also other tables seated after us were receiving their food.  We ended up waiting 25 minutes for the salad,(we think the server forgot about it) which came with Ranch dressing, menu says Italian. (our sever got us the Italian)  Although listed as an Antipasto this is acutally a chopped salad.Green pepper, green onions, tomatoes, onions, ham all diced topped with sliced pepperoni & shredded mozz and 2 pieces of thin flatbread that were limp and cold. We also had to ask for serving tongs and silverware. She brought us service for 2 not 3.The salad ended up only serving 2 of us anyway.   The pizza was not good. Overcooked, very thin cardboard crust and hardly any sauce.   We won't be back. When we left it was packed and people were waiting, why I don't know. There's just too many other great places to eat for the same price than to settle for this."}
{"text":"First time at this location- not coming back. I placed an order and had to get my drink and food re-ordered. I requested a frozen/blended margarita and I received one on the rocks. Then I ordered honey barbecue wings and received medium hot wings. My sister ordered her burger medium and received a rare burger. My other sister ordered traditional honey chipotle wings but they came out cold and stale. She said the meat was so dry and chewy. I am not happy with the service of our waitress.."}
{"text":"The service and food (wings, fried zucchini , and dinner salad) was good. It's a great option if you live in the area to watch NFL games."}
{"text":"First time being to this one since the one on bell closed. I didn't realize that Native new yorker shortened their name at a few locations. That was a little confusing. The floor plan is wide open. Went on a Sunday night which I guess is big for basketball, since they were a little busy. Got seated in the patio where the host quickly whipped down the table. There were a few tables that needed to be cleared off since we sat down that weren't until we left. We came for the wings and ordered 24 at a time plus some other appetizers.  When we ordered the next round, I moved the dirty dishes we had stacked for the wait staff to take to one of the other tables that needed to be cleared off, so we had room for the next round. Other than the lack of clearing off the table, the staff was friendly and check on us often to see what we needed. The open floor plan didn't allow for any noise cancellation so it was really loud inside but outside was fine."}
{"text":"I love native, but this experience wasn't the greatest. They usually have the best fried  zucchini as an appetizer, however, these were so soggy to the touch. We ordered to-go, so I wasn't able to ask them to be fixed. You can't go wrong with the Native Stripper Plater with Honey BBQ and ranch. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love there chicken bacon ranch flatbread,  if you haven't tried it you really must. Also enjoy the Asian chicken salad because it had pineapple and mandarin oranges. Hubby is having the filly chicken lol yes we eat a lot of chicken Kayla is our waitress tonight and she is so friendly and peppy with such a great smile"}
{"text":"After having a negative experience with one of the managers here, the owners reached out to us personally.. Al and Kathy I believe... and not only did they rectify the situation, they went above and beyond for us. Al talked to my boyfriend on the phone and profusely apologized and was just extremely genuine. They also gave us a giftcard for more than we paid for our meal. We will absolutely be back. It is very refreshing to have owners who care and really want to make things right. We totally understand things happen and when those people take ownership and make it right, it goes a very long way!! Thank you Al and Kathy!!"}
{"text":"Went to Native today for lunch. Quick seating and friendly service. I ordered the margarita  flatbread and my husband ordered the Asian ginger wings and honey bar-b-que wings. My flatbread was blah to say the least. Tough thin crust with melted cheese and cold tomato slices.  They forgot to put the basil on it. I sent it back for the basil thinking they'd put it back in the oven a bit more. Nope...came back to me just as cold. I give up. The wings were very good and I will get them next time."}
{"text":"I'd give them no stars if possible! Still waiting for my food while I type this and it's been 45 mins since I ordered. My kids just got their appetizers, just now! Ridiculous! Where's the manager????"}
{"text":"Updating my review-   I had terrible service from the manager at Native on Sunday morning when I had a problem with my bill. I was billed for an extra drink that wasn't mine and the manager who came over was rude and short with me throughout the entire interaction.    I recommend not taking your business here unless you want substandard service from the manager and potential issues on a simple bill (2 beers and a burger)   After letting the bartender know my bill wasn't correct she went and got the manager for me. The manager took several minutes to come over and when she finally did she failed to introduce herself or acknowledge why she was there.   The manager simply walked up to me to start the interaction with, \"do you want to pay your bill with this card?\" and picked up my credit card from the bar top.   She didn't introduce herself or acknowledge that she was there at her employees request to address the incorrect billing.  She just grabbed my card and asked if I wanted to pay my bill.   I responded that I'm happy to pay my bill as long as it's correct. She responded to that with my ticket was right and it's updated continuously by the bartender and I should have been checking it.    I told the manager the other bartender was at the machine earlier helping my bartender fix her orders as she didn't know whose bill was what so despite what appears on the ticket my bill was still incorrect.   The manager then walked off with my card without telling me if she was fixing the error or running my card for the incorrect amount so I got upset and lippy with her.  The managers job is to provide service and when there's a problem to deescalate it and resolve it. None of which she communicated to me until after I insulted her.  All of that over a $3.50 beer that I didn't even get to drink makes the service I received terrible and I would recommend never going there if you want your bill to be correct in a slow Sunday morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different flavor of wings and someone in our party ordered the Hangover burger. Burger was good but the bun fell apart so it became something you had to eat with a fork and knife. Also, the French fries tasted stale and old. We are thinking they passed them off on us since we wouldn't be eating them in the restaurant and couldn't send them back.   For a restaurant that specializes in wings, the wings weren't that good. They weren't tossed so that the sauces covered the wings which impacted the flavor. Everyone was disappointed. Next time we will go to Dominoes or Wing Stop vs. Native Grill and Wings."}
{"text":"If you are going be ready to spend some time in this place service is very slow. It may take 15 to twenty minutes to get water and a menu. Happy hour specials are great. They have good food if you are in the mood for bar food. The people that frequent the bar are fun and friendly. The out door patio is perfect to eat on if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"good wings, good beer, what else do u need ?  service was pretty decent, they seat U pretty quickly and try to get your orders taken quickly too.  We had orders of wings and the appetizer sampler.  pretty yum and nothing bad about them :)  come here and watch the game and drink a cold one :)"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, food is a joke and it took 30 min for 12 wings to come out. The wings were over cooked and were not the flavor sauce I asked for. Our waitress was hardly around and took forever to get our drinks and give and take our bill. Very disappointed and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is always great but the service at this location is horrible...Takes way to long to get your food ..Iwas warned but now I seen for myself"}
{"text":"Good wings. Great happy hour. Pizzas hit or miss."}
{"text":"I come here often. The service is always very good! Im always greeted and my order taken promptly. Food was hot, fresh n saucey baby!! I like my wings w a lot of sauce. Its real cool because the staff here are friendly n down to earth too"}
{"text":"Great place to go with the kids and with large parties.  Great wings, and you can order as many combos and flavors as you want.  Thursday is .35 wing night!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a few times and the service always turns me off. The food is always great, but it's hard to get any decent service. If you see the young waitress RUN! She seems to always have a negative attitude and is slower than a tortoise. I eat out all over the valley and I cannot think of a place with worse service.    This time my girlfriend and I waited at the front counter to be helped and we were not even acknowledged. The bartender and another worker were just having casual jokes behind the bar watching us stand there for a few minutes, so we finally left. Buffalo Wild Wings doesn't have pizza, but at least it has service."}
{"text":"i was at the Sheraton Crescent and i had to come here for lunch special everyday.  I ate so much good wings and spent so little money - amazeballs!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a bunch of time because I LOVE the wings (especially Hot BBQ and Hot w/Asiago parmesan dusting)! I always get them Extra Crispy and them make them perfectly. The wings a bomb, the beer is cold, the servers are cool, Karaoke nights are fun, and $.55 wings on Tuesdays are a great deal. Writing this review makes me want to go grab a bite there right now...  Note: I sit in the bar side 90% of the time, but the 1 time I sat in the restaurant side, the service was good as well. Also, I've only had pizza and wings here, so I don't know how the rest of the food tastes."}
{"text":"We came into the restaurant around 1130 and the bartender told us that last call was at midnight because of the volume of the bar. The listed closing time of native is 200am. My friends and I were more than willing to spend money on drinks and a good time but apparently management believes that the restaurant should be closed earlier. #1 It should be listed that the bar closes sooner than 2am and #2 bartenders shouldn't be complaining about management and the restaurant to customers. Finally #3 we would have never shown up if we knew the bar was closing at 12....."}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy with no sauce, loaded tater tots were not loaded except maybe with grease. Just yuk...."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this location never seems to have its stuff together! The wings are great or I'd never eat there again. Once a week I order them for takeout and I don't think they ever get the order right! It's never ready when they say and the staff is always clueless. It's too bad they can't get decent management cuz the wings rock."}
{"text":"Sunday evening, small crowd.  Took an hour  and fifteen minutes to get our food. But that was only half the orders.  There were mistakes with some orders. Wings were small and over cooked (little dry in inside).  Bacon on cheese burger under cooked. Sent back to get crisp slices. Came back the same way. Another cheese burger with no cheese. Asked for extra salad dressing. Never came had to ask a again. The manager shows up to ask about our food.  We let him know how long we waited and got 'oh sorry', I asked ' are you busy' his answer was no and then he disappeared. We told them we had a birthday for a young man.  But I guess they don't do that. The only redeeming thing was our waiter. He was friendly and did want he could.  I will not be back"}
{"text":"We love our local Native New Yorker. Michelle is an amazing server. We love eating here"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION.  FIRST  OF ALL THE FIRST pizza we ordered the ham was totally burned and the pizza was so doughy, when they remade the pizza it was still super doughy and the ham was cut up and placed on top and WASN'T  EVEN COOKED. The wings were super dry and while  waiting for the pizza we were FINALLY asked if we needed a refill AFTER sitting there for over 45 minutes darn near choking on dry wings and doughy pizza. What  a shame when the only  good thing about the visit was the 2 celery sticks that  came with the dry chicken strippers. That was a while 2 hours of my life that i will never be able to  get back.  WASTE OF TIME HUGE WASTE OF  HARD EARNED MONEY, SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE ."}
{"text":"Horrible! Took the family for a celebration dinner. It took forever to get the food, ordered an appetizer and kids meals first, server forgot to come back to take our entree order. We waited 40 min for the Kid's meals and appetizer. Ran out of drinks, had to ask 3 times before getting refills. Kids Mac n cheese came- looked like it had been sitting on the counter for an hour. It was crusty and dried out. Kids would not eat it. Wings were cold. Never got checked on after food was dropped at table. Went and got manager and she said I am sorry can we get you dessert? Seriously, my kids haven't even touched their food. Luckily my kids didn't want dessert they wanted to leave. Nothing adjusted on check, paid full price for three kids meals that were disgusting and weren't even touched! Horrible experience! I used to be a waitress and I would never treat my guests that way! It wasn't even very busy!"}
{"text":"Love the wings! Our favs are Asian Garlic and Strawberry Hot. Service has always been great and food comes out quick.   Best day to go is Thursday it Wing Night."}
{"text":"Went with my family for dinner and it was a total disappointment.  It took almost 20 minutes to get two milkshakes, then appetizers and salads all came out at different times. But the worst part was our strippers were incorrect.  Both my wife and I ordered them.  When they came they were not what we had thought we ordered.  Instead of boneless, skinless strips, they were basically chicken fingers.  I was told that that is what they are.  However that is not what the picture in the menu looked like.  In fact they were the same things that my son had ordered off of the kids menu.  We asked the server and she said yes that is what the strippers are.  She said that we should have said naked and grilled.  When we told her that is what we wanted, she tried to talk us out of it as it would take 20 minutes.  We said yes we will wait as we were not going to eat what was brought to us.    While we were waiting, the manager came over and spoke to us.  She even said that she would take the items off of our bill.  SO after about 20 minutes, the new strippers came and they were basically chopped up pieces of a chicken breast.    Then the bill came and the two orders of strippers were on the bill.  When I asked the waitress about it, she asked the manager about it.  She told us, that they did not charge us for the 1st order of strips that we did not eat. WOW!  I was too in shock to say anything else.  I paid my bill and left.  $85 for a horrible dining experience.  I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"First time at this location and from the looks of it, it was recently remodeled.  We ate in the bar witch is HUGE would be a great place to watch a game another time."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and after a long 6 hour drive, I stopped in for a drink.  Service: I felt rushed to give my order, I asked for a few mins to look over menu. The server came back immediately I didn't get a chance to completely look over menu. So I asked if they had fried pickle and was told this is Not \"BWW\". So I order chips and salsa.  Food: chips and salsa were terrible. The chips were greasy and rubbery. Stall tasting. I jus wanted to finish my beer and leave.  It took so long to get my bill , the server never checked on me. I could have jus walked out."}
{"text":"Oh the service there was just woefully sad...  I'm not sure how hard it could have been to make a meal.  My husband' s and kids meals came out on time.  He ordered a billion different flavors of wings, which all came out on individual plates per wing flavor, so the servers placed them on the neighboring table.  So as he was eating someone came by started moving his buffet of wing plates back on to our table and consolidating his food onto the plates because \"there's a party of 13 and they need the tables!!!!\" It was mayhem over the large party.  And it's just not cool to bug a man eating wings.  And no one seemed to notice that I didn't get my meal.  By the time we were ready to go, because my boys couldn't take it any longer and were crawling the walls, they finally delivered my meal in a to go box.  Since it was boxed up, I didn't notice that they had given me a children's meal I think?  I ordered the sliders, which is 3 little burgers and fries.  I got 2 burgers on burned rolls, and a tiny little portion of fries, just like my 4 year old son.  It's fine, they had already comped my meal, and our kids' meals too as a courtesy because it took so long to bring it, but I wouldn't go back here for anything.  I stopped at In n Out on the way home. The bathrooms were sparkling clean though, and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best wings in America!  I can say that with confidence because I travel the country every week and never had better than at home in this Native New Yorker resturaunt. Throw in the Manager, Carrie and her staff and you have a world class operation. Always friendly and greeted like family keeps us coming back almost every week. Great job all!"}
{"text":"Good bartenders, good specials and good selection of local craft beers. Plus they have sound for games on which is big thing to me. Will continue to go back often."}
{"text":"Service is SLOOOWWW but the food is good.  Maybe it's different at dinner time but if you are on an hour break you'll cut it close to back to work on time.  Wings are always the go-to item here.  Try all the flavors.  I get the lunch specials every time.  Wings and a burger + fries for $10-12!?  Pretty reasonable. Plus I always have leftovers to eat later.  Once their service picks up a bit I'll modify my star rating."}
{"text":"I have seen some of these locations close, venture in and try some of the food and you will know why. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best they get a solid 3. If you're considering their food then you can save a few dollars by buying the TGIFridays frozen meals at the grocery store. Same taste, same quality, same tears as you wonder what has come of your life as you choke back some tears of sadness as you eat the \"food\""}
{"text":"Been sitting here at my table for over 30 minutes. We only have our drinks and still waiting for our food. We might get it before they close. Our server is so preoccupied with the table that came in after  us. I swear he's try to hook up with one of them. They got their food, drinks and refills already and we only got our drinks. This is ridiculous. Probably not gonna come here again. Already put a bad taste in my mouth.....we ended up leaving. Still hungry. This place deserves 0 stars. I want the GM to contact me. I will NEVER come back here. Especially if that guy manager is still there. He went down the line and asked all the tables in our section if everything was good, got to our table and ignored us like we weren't there. I had to call him over to get his attention so he could check how long our food was going to take. Again, NEVER coming back. Taco bell here we come."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with the decline in service and food. Native used to be the spot to go to for cheap and saucy wings...now they just seem out to make a extra buck.  We went to this location and only saw our server twice (there were only four other tables that day- very slow day) once to take our drink orders and the last to drop off our check. As he was asking what we want to drink he eas walking away mid sentence then came back once he realized he didnt actually get an answer. We had to flag other waitresses down to get refills. When our food came out the highlight (wings) were extremely dry. You can also only get (depending on your wing size) a couple flavors. Before native became \"Native Bar and Grill\" you could order your wings however you want them...but yet the menu and staff say you follow the description but in small print it says you can order even one wing in a specific sauce? If you do ask for extra sauce or ranch for your dry wings prepare to pay extra (this would be okay if the sizes of sauce was consistant and not one larger cup and a smaller).  After the food we decide to order a cookie. I asked the waiter if we could do 1/2 and 1/2 he says no not possible. When I tell him the Chandler location actually offered it before he came back saying it was possible. So we tell him to go and wait...by the time its ready it was NOT to go and he leaves again once the error is stated. He did not tell us he was making another attempt. So here we are waiting thinking he was just going to put it in to go container and leave. Finally after everything and the check comes I realized there had been a mistake on the check. So I bring it to another waitresses attention since again our server is MIA she goes and tells someone behind a wall and comes out saying \"dont shoot the messanger\" which normally indicates someones frustrated. Well, we were too!   Btw...cookie was burnt when we got home...so that was a failure as well.  We wont be returning to this location ever due to service. Maybe someday in the future another Native but the attitude here was very off putting."}
{"text":"We tried this place due to an on screen ad at Digiplex cinemas which is across the street from Native.  By bringing our ticket stubs we got a discount off our check of a little over $4 on a roughly $25 total, so I think it was 20%.   We saw an early movie, so we went for lunch at about 1:30 pm. The food was good, we got tator tots which came with 3 dipping sauces, BBQ, Ranch & Queso (which was really good).  Then we split the beef on weck & had chicken strips tossed in a spicy honey mustard sauce.  The sandwich was great, it came with au jus & horseradish on the side (but we love that). The strips could have been more wet in my opinion, but were of good quality & quantity (we had the 1/2lb size & that was plenty).  The only thing lacking was enough help.  We sat at the bar as that's usually where you get the best, most attentive help.  Unfortunately the girl was alone to serve the bar stools AND the tables in the bar area.  She seemed a little overwhelmed, but was friendly & did as best job possible considering.   Overall, they have a standard wings/sandwich/wraps type menu with a few unique options.  Worth a try, but hopefully they can get more help in the bar area, it wasn't overly busy (about 1/2 full) so if they were busier, it could have been worse!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible as soon as we walked in. Greeted by the rudest waiter. Had to send 3 mix drinks back because they were watered down and tasted like there was no alcohol in them. We ordered onion rings and when biting into one, there was raw doe inside. When we informed the manager, instead of taking it off the bill, he just stated that the rest of the food will be fine. Told him to not even bother bringing the rest of the food. Would never return.. horrible"}
{"text":"I'm kinda sad the reviews aren't what I experienced; I had a great experience.   My bf took me here on a Friday night and it was busy. We were promptly greeted and seated in the bar area. Our waitress was very nice and funny. Our drinks and food orders arrived at a good time. We ordered a beer, Native Rita, chicken Parmesan and their fish fry. Everything was well seasoned and cooked just right."}
{"text":"I had the Greeks salad, all three of my kids had the bone in honey bbq wings and my wife had the Cobb salad. All of the food was good and Julian did a great job taking care of us. He also saved us $6 by telling us about the app. This was our first visit and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I guess they heard the complaints.  Our beers were very cold and stayed that way until I finished.  The Strippers, that's chicken strippers, were great!    The place was packed after 5:00 on Saturday, either for the UFC fight or for the Hockey.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love to go to this particular location for my wings. It's not that the wings are exceptional (although they are good) but the service and friendliness of the staff always makes our time enjoyable. My son and I always sit at the bar when we go because we enjoy the interaction with and the service of the bartenders. On Tuesday we have Becky who is always taking care of any need that we have. Sometimes it seems that she knows what we need before we do. Not only does she run a good bar but she always does so with a smile on her face.  Then on Sunday night we are served by Teddy. He too is excellent. Great communication skills, easy going person, fun to talk with as we eat. Always great service.  And it is always a pleasure to be greeted by the manager on duty, especially Kari. She is a lot of fun. A bundle of energy.  Actually all the staff is great which makes this particular location a great place to spend some time and eat some wings."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend sat down and ordered 30 wings. Usually on a Tuesday we would have waited a while, but they came out really fast!  Our waiter Steven was AWESOME! This was the second time he has been our waiter. And every time he has been not only very nice, but constantly checking up on us and making sure everything was okay. Native needs more waiters like him.  Definitely will be back, thanks Steven!!"}
{"text":"We came in with a very large party 40+ people and our server Paige and the manager rocked!  They were so friendly and patient with our chaos, we would highly recommend them.  Food was yummy too."}
{"text":"The bartender Amber is amazing!!! She gives great customer service and knows my drink before i even sit down at the bar! And that right there i think is GREAT customer service!!!  Always has a smile on her face,  and very friendly! She is the main reason why i keep coming back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"This will quickly become my new favorite wings place. My husband declared we will go every week until we have tried everything on the menu!  Woah! High praise."}
{"text":"Great wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday and their bottle beer specials make it for a cheap and very good night. We usually go to the Tempe location on Broadway but it is crammed with college students during the year. This location is much easier to find a table and the service is better as well."}
{"text":"We had a party of at least 35 for a birthday on Saturday 6:30 pm busiest time in a restaurant. Josh our serve was so wonderful. He was very prompt, none of our food was messed up. Not once was our soda glass more then half empty at anytime. Serving is not easy and this kid did an amazing job. Kudos to Josh. Thanks for a great expirence!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends after a meeting.    Environment:  Decent place to talk/unwind.  We usually are there after 8PM during the week, and it's usually pretty dead.  Not the place to go if you're looking for nightlife.  Food:  Wings are decent... like a bazillion choices in terms of what kind of wings and sauces to go with them.  Quality of the sauces is OK but not great... all of them just feel a little too much like corn syrup and I feel bleh if I eat too much here.  Have not had anything else.  Price:  Middling."}
{"text":"Second time in here and I've. Had to find employees to help me. Everyone here is more concerned with their personal life. Had a pick up order, was told 10 mins. Ended up waiting for over 10 mins after it took me 15 to get here. Worst native I've ever seen. Never going back."}
{"text":"Ordered honey hot wings, and they were good, but luke warm by the time they came out.  We ordered sliders and they looked like they've sat under the heat lamp for 15 minutes.  Very slim selection of beer, all the usual domestics plus one craft beer.  Recommend order just some bone-in wings and an everyday normal brew."}
{"text":"Ok I had the ghost chili wings.........yeeeee haw man those baby's were hot service was friendly BUT here's  my only personal complaint DONT play that God awful pop shit music the crowd here for lunch are almost all blue collar dudes .......I almost got up and left but the gals working were very nice...... Oh and I was hungry ......"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review.  I waited 30 minutes for a Coors Light, and our food took a lot longer. Multiple times the server asked if I needed anything and I reminded her about my adult beverage. When she went back to the bar the bartender pulled my pint out of the fridge.  Guess she forgot about it. I gave it two stars because I had four tables of awesome friends around me."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch last week. I ordered the Chicken Apple Walnut Salad. The salad was a pretty good size, chicken was cooked perfectly and there was a perfect amount of dressing. I usually find my salads drenched in dressing so this was great. The salad was delicious! I was waited on by Kristen and Josh. They were both polite, and we're constantly coming by to ask if I needed anything and to check in on how the food was. They were quick to refill my drink, which I appreciated. Overall great service, clean restaurant, and good food."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had an adult beverage with the wings & salad special. As soon as I got to the bar, I could smell the bar. Seriously gross so I moved to the far end of the bar and still smelled. Similar to moldy wet rags/water. Definitely needs a good cleaning (bleach!)! The wings were fine, the house salad - supposed to be super simple - it was alright, wasn't a fan of the oregano seasoning on it, but ate it because I was hungry. Service was great - she was on top of it. The smell is what had me questioning the cleanliness of my cups & counter."}
{"text":"I chose Native New Yorker for a celebration with family and friends as my son is leaving for school. I called and made a reservation for a party of 25 and Julie was so professional and accommodating. (I canceled my previous plans as their lack of professionalism led me to believe they my not be able to handle my requests).   Upon arrival to Native our table was set and ready. I spoke with the manager who introduced me to Ryan as he would be our server for the evening. Well, 25 turned into 38 AND RYAN DID NOT SKIP A BEAT!! He was so attentive to our party.  I am not exaggerating but NO ONE in our party complained of having to even wait for a refill. The food flowed  and we were able to enjoy ourselves as we had planned. IF YOU PLAN ON HAVING A LARGE PARTY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND **RYAN**   RYAN, everyone told me what a nice time they had.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!"}
{"text":"The food is average to slightly below average. Plenty of TVs for sport watching which is great!  Perfectly average bar... so many better places to spend your time and money."}
{"text":"Tuesday wing night! Caytlyn was a great server! Wings and beer specials were awesome! Great tunes tonight too!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we get to Arizona from California every few months, this place is our first meal before/ after a trip to Cabelas. Ice cold beer, good service, great prices and enough tvs to watch every game. Not sure what's up with these 1 star reviews. This place is better the B Dubs and most small wing spots."}
{"text":"Won't kid ya. Only had drinks and appetizers  But Michelle took great care of us. Didn't hover but we never had to look for her. My taste of the wings were good. Would prefer more spice but only orders d honey barbeque. I would come back again soon. Ask for Michelle."}
{"text":"My wife, son and wife went here to eat.  We didn't eat here cause unfortunatly they don't believe in the Second amendment.  Asking for there customer to not bring your gun in.  Even though I am a CCW..  I'm just curious if Native New Yorker can guarantee my family safety.  Cause if somthing happend I would sue the shit out of them.  Yet it doesn't matter cause I won't ever eat there until they back the Second Amendment.  Yes it is a grill and bar.  Yes someone might me drinking and have a gun on them.  So these idiots think like Obamma.  Let the dishonest ones carry and band the ones who do the right thing!!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited about Natives opening in our neighborhood. Initially, they delivered on good food and great service. Lately, the newer staff is terrible, the food is poor. Really sad to see this place go to crap. Could have been a great neighborhood bar and grill. Fat Willys is appetizing again..lol.. poor service, bartenders cant tend, foods often cold and wrong. Our last few visits, staff disappears and people actually just get up amd leave due to no service? When told, staff typically just smiles and blames newer GM. Too bad."}
{"text":"Service was great. I feel like the waitress may have been trying to warn us that there was really not a great choice for wing flavors. Gallagher's on Baseline for good grilled wings. I don't remember Native being so awful. The honey hot bbq sauce tasted weird. The fried zucchini was silly. First time I considered a dine and dash. The waitress was sweet."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just my server but I waited 20 minutes after getting my wings and asking for blue cheese and silverware :("}
{"text":"I love Native wings and food. Went to this location on a spur with a friend and ate the worst wings ever! The restaurant area did not seem too busy at all. Three waiters in here with maybe 10 tables taken. The service was extremely slow, even to get our drinks. We waited for a good 35-40 minutes for our extra crispy wings that came out soggy with a dry rub on them. Yuck! Bad service plus bad food equals never again at this location! Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Although the food was good after waiting 50 minutes after ordering to get it to our table, at this point I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. The mango peach tea was awful, the service may have been faster if they were in a coma...unbelievable. I also did not approve of having UFC fighting on almost all of the TVs. Not my idea of entertainment watch two guys beat the hell out of each other. But considering they just opened and I understand there are some bugs to work out, I will consider going back one last time to if see anything improves. If not, I wouldn't miss the place."}
{"text":"I live about 20 minutes away from this location in Peoria, but I don't mind the drive because Adrianna always takes care of me. She's constantly being sweet and friendly, and I like a bartender who I can conversate  with.   For example, I was with a friend at the bar when we both had to go to the bathroom. I walked away quickly and when I returned she had my purse behind the bar. She made my friend give it to her so she could watch it while we were away! How sweet."}
{"text":"Literally have been sitting at a booth for an hour and have seen our waitress once. Knowing it was graduation night and seeing a big party come in after us, I was willing to cut them some slack. But an HOUR? No drink refills- no apology- and no checking up to see how we are doing. This is absolutely ridiculous. Not only that, but the larger tables who came in after us STILL got there good before us. I would not recommend ever coming here if you expect ANY form of customer service. We arrived at 934 and just received our food."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, awesome atmosphere, great prices. This would be a five star if they would figure out when their specials are. I call in to find out because I forget when the 6.99 large pizza is and I am always told \"not tonight\". A couple of times we have went in anyway and sure enough they 6.99 large pizza was the first thing offered. All the employees should probably be on the same page with this as they are probably losing walk ins from the lack of communication. Outside of that, we will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I only go in the bar on either tuesday or thursday for their wing specials. The bar service is great, they keep you're drinks full and you're order arrives quickly. I have never eaten inside the restaurant or anything else on their menu so I cannot judge them."}
{"text":"I would have to say the wings were good but to tell me half way though my meal that I would have to buy a drink for my 6 year old since she was eating a couple of wings which she only had 3 of them. Was wrong!  Wing were 35 cents with a purchase of a drink, so I got 20 of them and a drink, It did not say that every guest needs to purchase a drink. I am in the food field and to have to penny pinch is a sign of bad business. Just because of this I do not think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Great staff, Tyler is my go to waiter. So nice & attentive. I have been here a few times and I am always satisfied with the wings. I have tried other foods. Recently tried a sandwich and it was so good. The potato skins are my fave. Their wing deals are my fave and are usually what I come for."}
{"text":"Went here for wing night. The wings are big and very saucy with lots of meat. Service was great. All the staff was very friendly. There was no wait time getting a table. The only thing I was to happy with was the amount of sauce on a few flavours of wings. There was just to much. All in all if you want a good wing place this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Oh my word this food was so gross ! We will never go back there again.  The place was gross and boring.  My family of 4 had 4 different meals and non of us liked anything we got."}
{"text":"Amazing honey hot wings! Not easy to eat when the restaraunt is just as hot as the wings.... miserable! Not sure if it was the volume of people present or if the A/C was down. Ick."}
{"text":"Good food and always enjoy stopping by. However, the gluten friendly menu cracks me up! Basically it says \"ask for no bun, ask for no croutons \" it also warns that it's not for real celiacs, so there's that. You can get a good bunless chicken sandwich- very tender."}
{"text":"The Wings are pretty good. At least on Tuesdays on Wing Night. Lots of fried food. Everytime I go there I think that I will enjoy the food, but when I taste the food I remember that most of it tastes really boring.   Stick with the wings..."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is back with a vengeance!! Food is spectacular, service is amazing and the place looks phenomenal. I liked the pizza before but my server told me they had a new recipe and dough and by far this pizza blows everyone out of the water!! Welcome Back to Laveen Native!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after some Christmas Shopping to catch the Steelers game. The door was opened for me and I was greeted was a warm welome!! That was just the beginning! Service was on point and food spectacular. I was asked if I had tried the meatball sliders yet. My server saw my hesitation and sold me on it by just her enthusiasm as well as the fact they were only two bucks!! Well worth it!! I'll be back on Sunday for more football and sliders. On top of a great experience; as I was leaving they opened the door again and told me to have a great evening!!"}
{"text":"Known for there wings. Good ones, meaty and hot. Bleu cheese on request. Not a lot of parking when really busy."}
{"text":"They are charging 5 dollars to watch the MMA fight in the lounge area.  At least offer it for free  for spending 5 dollars in food.   Hooters is free!  Some worker is rolling silverware on the front counter.   Classy!   Wings are alright!   Expensive!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years (since high school). I've had my fair share of wings from different places and honestly these guys have the best wings I've ever had. Excellent burgers. Appetizers are great.  Pizza needs work. I like that they update their menu. The people that work here are awesome. Now... please bring back the Friday drink specials lol"}
{"text":"First visit to the place. Service was good. Food was mediocre at best. The wings looked like the came from a small bird in the parking lot. We will not return"}
{"text":"My wife and I made the drive because we wanted some wings and normally we have enjoyed ourselves.  This time we stood at the front waiting a while for the hostess and when she showed up, she was not very friendly.  After being seated we watched he take at least 5 minutes going back to the front for the next group waiting.  We waited a full 10 minutes and never were offered water or spoken to in any way by any empoyees.  We finally gave up and left as we noticed the people that came after us were also getting fed up with the wait.    I did speak to the manager on the way out and he apologized and offered a free appitizer if we wanted to stay, but we declined.  I hope he fixes things there because the employees don't appear to care about the customers."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are pretty good but they are very small.  But when they are as cheap as they are, I guess you get what you pay for.  Overall you can do a whole lot worse at a chicken wing joint."}
{"text":"Wings are killer! Happy hour with local craft beer is great. The rest if the food is sub par."}
{"text":"Beers are cold and wings sauces are awesome, always have a few wings and then something from the variety of options recommend the Topper Burger or the skyscrapers"}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is known for its wings. The wings are strippers are excellent. I don't order fish at a steak house."}
{"text":"Excellent service from server Cassandra. Ordered the fish and chips.  You would expect them to be prepared in their kitchen. Instead, you get a version of some frozen fish and chips that were sub par.  I've had their burgers in the past. They were good.  So, take a pass on the fish and chips here."}
{"text":"Meghan makes our visit complete. The honey hot wings are the best. Loved the loaded tots too!!! Baby Lucille has mac n chee and oranges."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place ever we ordered and waited and waited finally got soup and appetizer....we ordered 18 wings the flats only.....waited another 35 minutes and they finally brought out drumsticks and flats told them not what we ordered they took it back then said that they were too busy in kitchen and couldnt do 18 flats...told them to keep them and give us check...asked for manager he was rude from the get go my husband said a cuss word he said you arent going to cuss at him my husband  didnt cuss at him he said a cuss word because of the service we received....he was rude arrogant unapologetic asked who his boss was again attutude told me too get his name right then told us to leave again rude....can believe this is allowed by this company.....cant believe they would think after  making someone wait almost an hour for food that the Manager DAVE would treat paying customers in this manner.......whatever you do dont go there......"}
{"text":"I sat outside with a group of friends, ordered a beer and was never addressed again. We had to leave because it was taking so long. We're talking 20 minutes. I was very sad because I wanted wings so bad."}
{"text":"Decent wings with plenty of sauce choices, cold beer, and lots of high def tv's in the sports bar : ) Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Not the best atmosphere, We finished our meals and had to remind them we had ordered appetizers. The Waitress came out with all kinds of stories of how the kitchen keeps screwing things up- then what I believe was the shift manager comes out and starts talking about how shipments are often messed up and corporate this and that. Neither paint a good picture for the place.  As far as the food- it was decent. Until I ordered an extra fish filet after asking if the fish fry on friday was all you can eat or not - The waitress said yes- then I was billed an extra $5 and the menu prices were also no what we were billed on our tab. Not really happy with the place at all."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but due to the fact that the Natives near me have declined considerably, I gave it another try.  Impressed is an understatement! By far one of the cleanest places I have seen. The staff are so friendly and happy. You can tell they love their jobs.  Alexis in the bar is one you must visit. She was on point on every drink I tried, and I tried every cereal shooter they have amongst other things.  I'm coming back tonight to try trivia.  Also if the bar isn't your thing might I recommend you ask for Lexi. She made my first visit back enjoyable and never waited for refills.  A shout out to the management team for a well ran restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They always make the best food and have excelent service. I am writing this review purely to say that my server josh was incredible. I came alone and was sitting at the bar at a very busy time. He was amazing at bringing me refills everytime they neared the end. He truly went out of his way to give me the best experience a guest could be given. I highly recommend asking for him to be your forever server!   I'm a regular to the Native Restaurants and have never had service as good as the service Josh gave me! A+"}
{"text":"Dined last night for an early dinner around 4pm. I was not greeted right away matter of fact 3 employees past me prior to what appeared to be a manager tell me she would be right with me. The restaurant was slightly busy with large parties and tons of take-out orders. The server who walked us to our table ended up being our server during our dining experience. She started off very friendly but then ended up being very rude. Her exact words were that we were making her life difficult. This was because we told her what we wanted for desert when we placed our order. This was only to be proactive. Well we requested our baked cookie to have the ice cream and toppings on two separate plates. This meaning one plate with the baked cookie and the other plate with the ice cream toppings. I am still trying to figure out what is so difficult about that. Especially when she is not the one who is preparing it. The good news was the food was great and came out in a timely manner. Our table split a Pizza and Wings. It did take a while for us to get our desert however this may be because our server got another table? Which they were not happy with her either since she did not come across friendly to them. This was my first dining experience there. I have always ordered take out. I would have had a good experience if the server was friendly. I could tell she did not like her job because prior to setting me she complained about the children that were dining before us and the mess they made. This was service minus the smile."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Apparently they ran out of silverware - how does a restaurant that has been opened and established run out of silverware?? Wings are very good but I won't go back because of the service. Received the wrong drinks and food took forever."}
{"text":"Always a good place to come for happy hour, watch a sporting event or even just day drink. I've had lots of items from the menu over the years, but I'll just touch on the wings, one of their specialties: Good, but not the best wings out there. The hot buffalo sauce is great and has a nice kick, but the wings are pretty small for the price. Overall, still a great place. Boost the wing size and I'd give four stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, American style menu with finger food, burgers and on. Very interested to try the pizza with eggs on it next time I go in, looked amazing. Will return, quick service as well as very friendly."}
{"text":"Sooooooo I'm here out of town visiting a friend and we decide to call in an order. She specifically tells the girl 2 separate orders since we are paying with cards. We get there food is ready in the window and the girl can't get the order separated so we can pay. After running around the store for 10 mins looking for her manager she finds him. Then he quickly walks off. I ask for an itemized receipt, another 10 minutes looking for him. And he quickly walks off. This was yesterday at 8pm. It's obvious the girl was trained on the register and the manager didn't care that she wasn't trained. We got home to eat and our food was completely cold, couldn't even eat my loaded fries. Chicken could of been good but it was soggy now. Management doesn't care about growing sales and creating returning customers then I don't care to return."}
{"text":"One thing that I noticed when I went inside the building was that it was way too cold. I get cold easily, but many of my friends confirmed that they were cold as well, and couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant into the heat. Now, that's a bad sign from the beginning. It's pretty warm here in Arizona - I don't understand why the restaurant needs to blast the air conditioner so much.   While we were freezing away, the waitress gave us awful service, and barely checked in. I don't think I saw her smile once, and she had a very off-putting manner about her. She wasn't helpful at all with the order, and to top it off, she took forever to bring me a separate menu containing allergen information. She started taking the order right after I received my allergen menu, making me rush through; I didn't want to hold off my friends from ordering any longer. On top of that, the food seemed to take forever to come out. To be fair, we were in a large group, but the wait time was just too much.   The waitress forgot to bring out my friend's appetizer and another friend's ranch, and she brought out the wrong order for me. I got the $7 lunch dish that consisted of two chicken wraps with fruits on the side, but she gave me the $10 dish consisting of three chicken wraps, no fruits. I didn't bother mentioning it to her because I was afraid of the additional wait time that it would take to add the fruits, but was quite unhappy about the extra charge that was reflected on my bill, compared to the original lunch order. Since the waitress rarely checked in, had a demeaning attitude, and left as soon as she was \"done\" filling up the waters leaving no time for me to ask her anything, I had to personally walk up to the front to another waitress and ask her for a to-go box.   Now, let's talk about the food. I liked the fries - they were pretty good. However, the chicken wrap wasn't worth it - I could make better chicken wraps with a piece of lettuce, some canned vegetables, microwaveable chicken, and ranch. Wasn't about the food at all.   The one positive about this restaurant is that there are lots of TV's, so it might be a good place to go to if there are sports events (if there are no other places open). I don't think I'll voluntarily come back here again, unless there's a meeting or an event."}
{"text":"Yummy, I love Native's wings! You can choose how many you want of each flavor and not have to order an entire plate. Also there is something for each member of your picky family :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, relatively nice staff, open late. I can't think of much more that other reviews haven't said."}
{"text":"Love this location! Their pizza and wings are amazing. The customer service is great, fast service and never a wait! The food is always very fresh and delicious! We visit this location very often and will continue. So close to the highway and perfect since there aren't very many sit down restaurants in Buckeye."}
{"text":"It's a Native New Yorker, pretty much just like all the others.  Always tasty food, good drink selection, and decent service.  This location has a nice patio and is pretty quiet except during games."}
{"text":"We have been as a family a few times and have always had good service and good food. Today I ordered on the app for pick up and accidentally chose the wrong location. The manager, Nick was so nice and accommodating as well as the manager of the other location. They works together to fix the problem and I really appreciated it. The wings were great as usual!"}
{"text":"Walk in almost zero acknowledgement we are there by the staff. Bar tender resting on counter talking with friends and other employees. 15 minutes to get a water. Called over manager right away and situation deteriorated vs corrected. Server does not bring happy hour menu, had to request! Then she mislead us on the drink specials so the supposed $5 Tito's and tonic became $8.50 all of a sudden! Wings requested crispy, far from it!!! $.50 side sauce had to be requested three times! Do not go here and we will never go back."}
{"text":"4 stars because of the wings, take out service is horrid. Dine in service is worse."}
{"text":"Yummy wings and pizza for a good price. Our waiter was super nice and friendly. Good spot to watch sports and have pizza!"}
{"text":"It was fish friday and the best fish I've ever had.  I did quite a bit of reflection to arrive at that conclusion too since I've had a lot of good fish.  I will again drive at least past 3 Native Grills to dine here."}
{"text":"Love the new loyalty program that comes with a free six wing order and $10 off every 100 points! There are a ton of wing sauces and rubs to choose from as well as a full menu with pizza and sandwiches. Almost every day of the week there is something on special- not to mention a great happy hour! I'm a big craft beer drinker and there is always something good to choose from without having to settle. The service is quick and the roomie patio offers a great place for smokers."}
{"text":"This location gets very busy on weekend nights so come prepared to sit outside or at the bar. They have FREE Texas Hold'em tournaments on Saturday's and everyone is very friendly. Don't be afraid if it's your first time playing! They recently came out with new menus but have the older entree's if you just ask. I love the parm asiago dry rub and medium, not too spicy! Try coming tue-wed for specials on their wings."}
{"text":"Such a bad experience! We were the only people in the whole restaurant. Came in for a to-go order and it took them at least a half hour to bring us wings. Never going back there again for anything. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this sad excuse of a restaurant is closed. The food was great...service and atmosphere was HORRIBLE. It felt empty and awkward. Although many employees were working...service was subpar and they always acted like you were a burden for coming in."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere but every time we've been to this restaurant our orders have either been messed up, cold or the service has been horrible so we have decided that we will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Just left Native, took my son out to eat since he's a sports fan decided to go there since they have lots of tvs and you can watch the game there. While I was there I had the queso pork dip, dip was pretty good, cheese was smooth and creamy a tad salty but that is to be expected when mixing pork with cheese. Chips that came with were somewhat stale and of course more saltier which basically made the appetizer to salty for my taste. For our main course my son and I both had the stripper platter. I ordered my stripper platter with the honey hot flavor, however the sauce tasted like it was going bad. I ate one of the strippers and couldn't continue as it was making me sick.. My son ordered his strippers with buffalo sauce and I heard no complaints from him. Seeing as how natives is basically across the freeway from bdubs you would think that their food would be on point but it seems like the quality of the food has gone down drastically since the last time I was here. I'm making a mental note to just head over to bdubs next time and avoid the stomach ache I just had to endure."}
{"text":"Native is probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Typically the service is on point and the food is delicious. I may go out of my way at times to come and get their stripper platter which includes 1/2 pound of strippers with a side of fries with any one of the delicious sauces and a side of ranch. On Saturday nights they have karaoke which is also a fun time if you're into karaoke. However on this Saturday night I came in and ordered my food and had to wait for over 45 minutes to get my food during this time the waitress did not come to check on our table nor refill our drinks. When our food came it was room temperature and there were items missing with our waitress being no where to be found. We waited an additional 15-20 mins for an order of fries and ranch that never came to our table. The ladies restroom has only 3 stalls and conveniently only one stall was available as the other two were out of order which poses a problem if multiple people need to go to the restroom. All in all not the best experience that I've had at native."}
{"text":"Took 10 minutes before somebody finally asked for our drink order. My wings and my daughters meal came out wrong. Took 15 to get our bill after we asked for our check. Customer service over all was horrible and no one seemed to care that our order came out wrong even though the waiter knew exactly what we ordered so she didn't even know why it came out wrong. Honestly, just ruined my entire lunch. This is the only location that has been horrible. Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Good wing deals on wing night which is a plus.  Nice variety of sauces, and you can combine them which is nice.  Good amount of TV's for the games.  Service is spectacular.  However, if you are a non smoker and go there after 9pm'ish when the bar inside closes, you have to sit outside in the smoking gallery.  This peeves me, particularly if you have trashy loud obnoxious people sitting right behind you.  The smoke would be much less offensive if it were an open area, but it's roofed so it just lingers.  Grrr."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go tonight.  I asked the guy if he could mix the suicide sauce and honey garlic sauce for me for the wings. He said that he could not do that.  I find this odd having worked at a restaurant before and this is something that is completely doable.  Furthermore, I have been to other native NY'ers and this was never a problem.  Basically, it just comes down to not really caring about pleasing the customer.    When I showed up, I got the impression that the place was disorganized.  I remember asking to get BC instead of ranch, so he walked back into the kitchen to get me that, but came out empty handed.  Then a minute later some other guy comes out with it.  Whatever system they have to keep the orders straight and what needs to come out next for their separate take out window seems to lack."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service is a understatement! Go to Red Robin or Events for a quick bite or a Drink. My drink only took like 10min before I had the beg for food service! Would never come back here again! Would rate zero if I could!"}
{"text":"She was about to give the next table to another guy,  when L stepped in and said something.  She had the nerve to tell that guy, oh sorry ihave to say summertime else first, I'll tell you why later.  Really? Are you twelve? And right in front of us? Really great customer service. She needs to go because she can't handle the pressure. Why they don't invest in those buzzers for these events.  Not very happy. .. we come here quite a bit and his family is here every Monday. I'll flag manager down, if I can. I had to downgrade my rating this time. Food rocks, but they need to reassess their Hostess."}
{"text":"This is a great place for wings and sliders. The quantity is perfect as well as quality. There are so many choices to choose from and by far you won't go wrong. Plenty of TVs and great trivia. Our waiter, Josh was tentative and proper. Also, our neighborhood walks over to native.. so it's nice to know quality not quantity. Thanks for being in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Staff is awesome. Always friendly and check on you consistently to make sure you always have a cold beer!!  Great place to watch college football in the fall!!  Shout out to the servers outside by the fire pit!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times my service and quality of food was Both Sub-par and Offensive.  I heard there Wings were Good, they came highly recommend. I came across a GroupOn, I thought what a great way to finally have a reason to try this place. Boy was I wrong.  The first time we went in, the service was Awful. You could tell they were short handed. We sat patiently while our kids made a mess with the Sugars. After about 15 minutes with no one even stopping by to check on us, I mean at this point my kids were going to town on the Sugars. Finally a Waitress came by with two tablets for the kids to play with. She was great. Apologized for the wait. Her customer service was on point. I showed her my group on. She took our order. Family Cambo. Lrg cheese pizza 20 wings and a Salad. Cheese pizza came out burnt! And they served it to us... where's the Quality Control? My poor kids were starving so they ate it. The wings were Amazing as promised. We tried the honey hot and Garlic Parm. No problems there. The manager took care of us, despite the over cooked pizza made us want to come back. I mean the place is really great. So we did.  Until Today. We ordered the exact same thing. Food was good service was good. Until it was time to pay, the Owner Refused our Groupon. He claimed we were trying to \"Come up on him\" I'm not really sure why? Nothing had changed from the order before. He blamed his staff and management, for the mistake. There was no customer service. In fact he was rude and blamed his employees. Saying they made a mistake the first time. Refusing to honor it. all over a 10.00 difference. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The Owner Marcus. Who \"prided himself on Customer Service\" made no effective effort to make us want to come back.  The food and experience could be great, I do recommend it, just not at this one!! Go to one that takes better care of the customers. \"You won't be back, why do I care.....\" -Owner  yes your right I won't be, because it's of the lack of training and professionalism from the Owner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  Met expectations, nothing under or over.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the open air.   We ordered a cheeseburger and the cali cluck.  Cheeseburger was very good, fresh.  The cali cluck I would probably not order again as the ciabatta roll overwhelmed the small piece of chicken/avocado.  Bartender was nice and service was good."}
{"text":"Use to love coming here every week with my boyfriend. They had the best bartender, who took our orders even if we weren't sitting at the bar. He moved to another bar few months back. But man ever since he left, that place is not the same. They have new servers every time I go in there. One time we had to remind the server 2 times about silverware, ranch, and our drinks. Oh and also if we could change the tv from a high school hockey game to a real game that was on that night. He clearly forgot about it. So when our food finally came, we slowly ate until the ranch came. He took 15 minutes to get ranch and our food wasn't even good anymore.. When he brought the ranch over, he ended up dropping it on the ground on accident right at our table. Couldn't help clean it up, because we had no silverware or napkins. Not the greatest experience."}
{"text":"Our waitress is awesome. The food is ok. Buuuuuuuuuuuuut,,,, I let the two hostesses know that the men's restroom was FILTHY. DISGUSTINGLY FILTHY. There's no toilet paper to use cuz it's all over the damn floor. The two urinals???!!!!,,, NO FUCKIN WAY?!!!!!!!!!,,,,, 1of them is filled with urine that if you flush it, it'll spill over onto the floor. The 2nd urinal: piss all over the floor in front of it. I told the two hostesses and they told me they would let management know. THAT WAS 90 MINUTES AGO!!!!!!!!!! IT'S STILL DAMN DIRTY!!!!!! This place is lucky I'm giving a 1 star."}
{"text":"We had the house special pizza and the meaty beast pizza along with salt and vinegar, ancho chili lime, Asian garlic, and medium wings. Everything was really great. We enjoyed the food and drinks. The service was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Five stars because of Ashley and her stellar customer service! Food average, but customer service makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Tyler is a very good server. Anticipates your needs and is fast and friendly. Ask for him!!  We had wings habanero mango great flavor!!!  Honey bbq very sweet and tangy!!  Hot and fresh!!  We come here often and try new things!  Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars!!! The menu was sticky and when I ask for a new menu the next one was just as sticky... I should have left we had order drinks already. The WORSE WINGS WE EVER HAD!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service from the management did not have a clue on reservations, gave away our party space,guests sat separate , one server for 25 people, restaurant was empty for a Thursday and they still squished 3 party's in one corner , food was ok? After all that, won't  be going back . Called to confirm and still had it wrong"}
{"text":"I only gave four stars because I didn't eat there. I only stopped by for directions, but was greeted by Jim. He was very friendly and answered questions about the establishment, and of course, the Yankee game playing. I wish I could have stayed and watched the game. It was a pleasing, relaxing atmosphere, a place I would like to eat and view sports. Very cool place to be."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We brought over 40 people to the restaurant after a Perry football game. 3 patrons were blowing cigarette smoke into the kids faces and management refused to do anything about it. Disgraceful. And the patron was taking pictures of these minor kids and video taping them. Management refused to do anything about it. We will NOT come back here."}
{"text":"It was okay..  I guess what's appealing from this restaurant is their offer on chicken wings which is only 39 cents a piece.. The long waiting plus a very dark limited space not really my taste.."}
{"text":"So disappointed we had a bad experience from the beginning. We sat at the bar while waiting for our table and the bar tender was rude I did not have my ID  but I wasn't drinking they refused to serve my husband because I didn't have my ID. This is not a bar it's a restaurant. Then we sat down at our table and we were ignored the whole night. Our server had 4 tables and she visited the other tables multiple times while never stopping at our table. We finally ordered our drinks waited about 20 mins before we received them and my husbands drink was wrong it took about 15 mins to flag someone down to tell them the drink was wrong. He received the right drink after we finished our food. Our server didn't serve our food someone else did. So we saw our server a total of four times, to take our drink order, take our food order, bring our drinks and to bring the check."}
{"text":"When I lived next to the power and Ray location I was at native two days a week with my friends. Since am near the Gilbert and German every time I go is terrible. Food comes out tasting ok but the servers always make you feel like you're inconveniencing them. Went last night and overheard our server talking about how it's the perfect job because he can stand around watching baseball. I don't even know his name but from the moment he stepped to the table to the second he dropped off our check(after forgetting to split it) meanwhile made sure to have plenty of time to socialize heavily with his one other table. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good wings! Good service. Reasonably priced. Love this place! I've been eating at NNY for over 20 years. Started at the Gilbert & Southern location, but have eaten at a variety of locations since. I've introduced others to NNY as well. It's one of our favorite places. My husband and I have tried other wings places (all the other local places that I won't advertise here) and always end up back at NNY. The flavor, service & consistency keep bringing us back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Their honey hot wings are so good and have reverse happy hour! So so good and definitely try the loaded fries. Loud and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"10 mins at the bar and no service.  Didn't see the bartender and waitresses just passed by.  And on the night I went to get my free appetizer from the app for being a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Hubby likes going here for their \"strippers\" and cheap happy hour, so we've gone a few times now. They have a cool bar set up (with plenty of TVs) but honestly the service has been less than stellar each time we've gone (and by \"less\" I mean like not even close). Service is slow (we're talking molasses) and not that friendly. The food is tasty (we've had their strippers & sandwiches), and the happy hour is good. But other than that, I would wholeheartedly give the place an \"A-OK\" and not much more than that."}
{"text":"We bring my mother here often for the fish fry Friday for lunch. She loves the French Onion Soup! Christina is our favorite! Very attentive and professional! Moms unsweetened iced tea is always full!"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate the number posted all over the internet is a invalid number. I even called multiple locations to try and retrieve their actual number. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem deserves more credit than it gets.  I had a fabulous cobb salad that I would rate better than most Sports Bars would have.  There was a separated bar and restaurant which is always a bonus for this kind of restaurant, it was clean, lit up and plenty-o-TV's.  The service was very good and I would go back in a heart beat to try their wings and pizza."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible. No excuse at 315 in the afternoon with 4 tables sat..."}
{"text":"Native use to be the place to go for great wings..NOT so much any more.  I just wonder when they started charging full price for a half a wing?  You either get a drumette or a wingette--NOT both together which constitutes a \"wing\".  Seems like their prices have gotten higher and their food portions smaller. They have also gotten rid of several of their tasaty menu items. The last time we went we had a Groupon and they would NOT accept it for their lunch deals.  Sorry, we are just NOT impressed with management at this Native.  We use to go all the time, but no longer.  I can say we have always had great servers, but thats about all."}
{"text":"We've been to this location on 8 separate occasions. The service has been less than desirable, always seems to be slow service no matter how busy the bar is and once the food is dropped off at the table good luck seeing your server again unless you wave your hand to get their attention or ask another server for assistance. The straw that broke the camel's back for us was when I had a bug crawl up my leg and shortly there after my daughter had a bug crawling up her leg. I told the server and he said \"let me get the manager\". The manager comes over with his cell phone, turns on they light and looks under the table and says \"We don't have a bug problem\". I told him I didn't say you did and repeated way I told the server. So what does the manager repeat, \"we don't have a bug problem\". I didn't want anything other than to bring it to his attention and I felt as if he thought I was lying. No apology, no concern, nothing in the way of caring about a customer. It was enough for us to never visit this location again. Show some concern, even if you don't mean it. Extremely disappointed in the response I got."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to native in ages and used to be regulars. Last night we had a disappointing experience. The server was horrendous. We heard everyone around us being told about the nightly special and hh specials... we weren't told of any specials. She asked what we wanted to drink, I asked if they have IPA and received a five second uncomfortable blank stare. My salt and pepper wings were drowning in grease (I literally squeezed them with napkins) but seemed they would have otherwise been delicious. She checked on us for the first time when we were almost finished.  My husband devoured two dozen hot wings and was pleased which is why I am giving two stars. Next time- take out for hubby and I'll run to chipotle!"}
{"text":"so you can call in your order for wings in advance but they don't \"sauce\" them until you get there which still takes 15-20 mins. What's the point of calling it in? It's a good things their wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"I literally only downloaded yelp to post this because I received no restitution or sympathy for my poor service from a manager at this location. So maybe the GM or corporate will see this! My friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat on a Saturday night and she recommended Native Grill because she had previously been to other locations and she really enjoyed them. When we walked in, there were maybe 5 hostess and servers standing at the host stand. Me working in a restaurant I didn't think much of it because I totally get that when you're waiting for the dinner rush to start things can be boring. The dining room was pretty empty there were maybe 5 tables seated in the main dining room and 2 tables sat in the back room. Because it was my first time here i'm not completely familiar with the layout I don't know if there was another section of the restaurant where it was more busy but from the looks of all the employees standing up front, it was a slow night. The hostess sat my friend and I and told us our server was going to be \"Spencer\" who i assumed was the server standing at the booth next to ours, as he was helping his other table I didn't expect him to drop everything and greet us, as I said, i also work in a restaurant. But I was wrong, apparently he wasn't our server, as we watched plenty of servers walk back and forth past us, not one came over. Then it came to our attention that about 6-7 servers and hostesses were still standing at the host stand. No hostess went to our \"server\" to check if we had been waited on, no other server greeted us to get us started with drinks, until NICK came along. He noticed my friend sitting at our table STARING at all of the employees at the host stand who were doing nothing. He told us he wasn't our server but he would get us started with some drinks and we REQUESTED he be our server that moment because it was clear no other employee there had any intention of serving us. Nick was awesome and timely and got everything right from that moment on. He went out of his way to help us because he saw that NO other server was going to and I think that's awesome because it was clear or table was not in his section and he waited on us anyway. Shout out to Nick. Anyway while we paid we spoke to a manager, we didn't get her name but she was a skinny younger woman with brown hair and a tattoo on her arm. We told her how her staff stood there talking, while we sat un-greeted for 10 minutes and she stood there nodding her head like she understood what we were saying but didn't care at all. She had nothing else to say other than \"sorry\" she had no explanation as to why it took so long and no sympathy or intention of correcting her staff. She honestly seemed like we were bothering her because she was standing up front conversing at the host stand too. We didn't expect anything other than a sincere apology and we didn't even get that. I'm not sure if they just thought we were two college girls who \"weren't gonna tip anyway\" so who cares what we think but it's super unfortunate that this place has such horrible customer service when that's what restaurants are all about. We definitely will not be returning to this location because the management is horrible."}
{"text":"There is always the one food establishment that will cause you to write your first review and native definitely disgusted me enough to do so. I don't like badmouthing businesses but I think maybe this will help them improve their food. So I placed an online order; I was really craving wings, I go to pick them up from the lady at the front desk who was really nice btw. I get home open my wings, I am greeted by 5 sad looking excuses for wings (they might as well have been raisins). They have a glowing orange sauce all over them (we're talking highlighter orange) visually grossed out but not judging a book by its cover. I take a bite and immediately spit my food out the wing tastes like they have been fried in  2 week old oil that someone pooped in. The sauce tasted like spicy, vinegary, orange, cucumber puree. Maybe that's just my opinion but I swear they tasted like cucumber. Next I had a order of the loaded fries, same oily poopy taste. I don't know if the cook just did a half ass job but I don't know why people continue to waste their money here I really hope they check their quality control and put some love into their craft. Sorry not sorry"}
{"text":"So it's been about 4 months since we've been here and they have a new menu, no more fish & shrimp.. only fish. No more house calzone (no pepperoni) but a lot more crust less filling - the beers a little more expensive and 2 ounces  less. Don't know if we'll be back - pretty sad"}
{"text":"Came here for the fight.   Was extremely packed but even though it was so full that people were standing our service was still quick and attentive. I didn't eat this time but I do love their wing strips.  Wasn't happy that the girls taking cover charges were literally less than a foot behind my chair and bumping into me the whole time and being extra annoying, they were not very professional!"}
{"text":"I love coming here, but it's a tad pricey without specials. The bartenders are fantastic and do their best to help you get the best bang for your buck along with suggestions for dishes. The wings are pretty great, but the rest of their menu is good as well. Great place to visit to have a beer and watch the game, but just sign us for rewards so you don't pay too much for what you're getting!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Atmosphere is relaxed. Friendly staff. Variety of beers both on tap and bottle. Great outdoor seating. Native is even good for families. Kids are welcome to join in the fun. Not to discount bringing a first date here would not suffice. I met my current boyfrind here for our first date. We continue to go here even a year later."}
{"text":"The wings aren't that great!! Can't even get a good salad, & Unfriendly staff!!! Wing stop is  much better or even Popeyes (which is a cross the street)."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now and have been happy every time. The food had always been great and the service has been too. They have great happy hour specials $3, $4, $5 drinks and appetizers. I have had boneless wings here a couple of times and have loved the sauces. The cob salad, the flatbread pizzas and the BBQ pork sliders are all very good! They used to be located on Grand Ave behind the Goodwill and I wasn't very impressed the couple of times I went to that location, but this location is much better!"}
{"text":"If I had to rate the food alone, this place would get 3 stars.  Luckily, I am including service.  I have read most of the reviews and it seems they have a service issue.  Well, we actually experienced great customer service.  My friend and I sat in the bar area.  We were served by a very charming server named Lloyd.  What a nice guy.  So if you want good service, ask for him!  Now, for the food.  We started off with the asiago wings.  Delicious!  I would order those every time.  Then we ordered a pizza called Meaty Beast.  I am going to assume that the pizza is frozen or the toppings are.  When we got the pizza, my friend and I were trying to identify what one of the toppings was.   It look like freezer burned sausage, maybe?  We tried a piece and it had no flavor, so we took as much of the sausage like material off.  I can't say I would ever order that again.   We also had drinks, which were just fine."}
{"text":"Didn't actually get to eat there last night....poor customer service.  I arrived and asked for a table for 3. Asked if I wanted bar or dining room...dining room please. I can get you a table or booth, both dirty...I' ll take the booth once it's cleaned. I waited, watched booth get cleaned, hostess not around....I waited. In walks another trio, hostess takes them to the booth I've been waiting on. I tell manager....he tells me it was a mistake and I can get another booth in the bar... I don't want the bar....I am with my kids. \" then we have another booth...we are walked over to another DIRTY booth...\" Can you wait while we clean this one off?\" Mean while the people who were sat at the original booth we were promised is now being served.... I walked out...frustrated and hungry after working a 12 hour shift at work."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good here.  The service and timing of food was unsatisfactory.  We sat down at 2:18pm.  Ordered at 2:40pm.  Received our food at 3:25pm.  When we asked for a manager - she showed up and wanted to argue with us on the timing.    This is when consumer personal electronics are beneficial.  Anyways, she took $10 off our bill and apologized only after we brought attention to the issue."}
{"text":"Service was so so. Our waitress was very friendly but had a hard time keeping up with our table, for only having 5 tables sat in the restaurant.  To her benefit, we had a group of nine but it was a pretty simple order.  They have amazing wings and it's a great place to come out and watch a game or enjoy happy hour.  We will be back, especially for their honey BBQ wings."}
{"text":"I live 2 minutes walk from this place. I went one night for a quick dinner. The fries pictured were surprisingly not that bad. However, I've had a couple different burgers from here and it was safe to say as soon as I left this last time that I would certainly not come back. The food is just super sub-par and tastes like it's all been frozen for a while before cooked and served. I wish there was a better bar right next door."}
{"text":"Worse to go service ever.   Waited for an hour for pizza and wings.  Gave me an excuse the first one was made wrong.  Not the first time.  Not going back."}
{"text":"About a month ago I left a review about my service here. Few days later I got a call from the manager. He apologized about my experience and sent me something in the mail. It's things like that that really show the values of a company. I was happy with the phone call since most places won't even do that but they went above and beyond and that erases the type of service that was provided, showing that it was the person not the establishment that was falling short. Thy fixed what had be incorrect. Back to a great place in my book!!"}
{"text":"I like interior here, good service , sports programs. But I was disappointed with wings and cold coffe."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible.   With so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent."}
{"text":"First the good news...we had the 2 for 20 deal and the chicken pot pie was great.  I had the pizza. It was horrible.  For our appetizer we chose the chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty good.  The chips were very close to dripping with oil.  We could have asked for a box to go and changed oil in our car.  Was hoping this place would fill a void for restaurants in that area.  Burn a little gas and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our server Antonio was awesome.. the pizza was excellent! Thank you and keep up the great work! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Came in at 700 pm Saturday night  place is clean  .  Waitresses were slow. Handling to many tables each 30 minute ticket times   food was average    I'll skip next time ......"}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeted by the manager Collin he was super friendly and asked where we preferred to sit.  We chose our own high top and He brought menus and silverware over. Megan was our server she was there in no time. She was also super friendly recommended a couple good beers and we ordered. The food was awesome as usual the buffalo cheese dip was probably all of our favorite.  Was nice to be in a friendly atmosphere as my first meal since coming in town from Vegas.  Collin came back and checked on us further in our meal.  Overall a great experience for my family n myself. Thank you Collin and Megan!"}
{"text":"I never leave unhappy from here great food great service. Renee was awesome and really had exceptional service."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try Native New Yorker, was in the area and the wife and I decided to try it out. Now Native New Yorker is your typical sports bar, so we came here not having any high hopes for this place. I had their philly cheese steak, wife had their cheeseburger. We also wanted to try their pizza. I was real happy with their philly cheese steak, they were not shy with the meat. Everything was well seasoned and had a good amount of cheese and peppers. I was very satisfied with my sandwich. Wife was very happy with her burger, a little to big for her, but she had no problem putting it away. We both shared a slice of pizza, well lets just say we could have had a better pizza from our freezer. I asked them to cook it well done, we like our pizza crispy. That didn't get done, pizza was not that great, their sauce was just bland. Over all this place is OK, I mean really what do you expect from a sports bar chain? Would I ever come back? Yea, why not."}
{"text":"Sub par at best. and I mean at BEST. Service is pretty horrible every time, beer is cold, which is just about the only plus."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and catch a game! The back has a lot of seating (tables and booths) and TVs at every angle so that they have multiple games playing at once! They have a pretty good happy hour from 3-7pm, with a variety of appetizers (every day) and assorted drinks (except Saturday).  Came with a group of friends to watch a football game, and we ordered an assortment of appetizers, 2 pitchers of Blue Moon, and a couple entrees to share. I got the buffalo fish sliders, because they seemed pretty unique. The plate came with 3, and although they were a little heavy on the mayo they were really tasty! Unfortunately, the curly fries I got on the side could have been crispier/more flavorful. Their steak fries didn't look too great either though. I would say their food is good, but not amazing.  Overall, we had a great experience! Our server was really friendly, and the environment was spacious and clean! Will definitely revisit when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"We had really fantastic service at this location. I wasn't expecting to have a fantastic experience, but it was. The wings were good, the chicken sandwhich was really great. ok fries (don't know why they call them extra long or extra crispy - they're just regular fries, but have some skin on them, which is good). Really great bbq sauces. They have Pibb Xtra, which I enjoy. Service was amazing though...not sure what everyone else is talking about."}
{"text":"Jacob greeted us and was really friendly .  Our service was amazing . Will come back to this location"}
{"text":"Everytime my friends and I have been here, the service has been horrible. A few examples are as followed: 1. Rarely checks on you                 2. Got our drink orders wrong                 3. We waited forever to get the bill or even to get another drink. It was so bad we had to raise our hand and although she saw us she still completely ignored us                  4. All the waitresses/ bartenders seemed more into flirting and socializing with each other to do their job. We were her only table at the time and she seemed irritated that she had to stop socializing after another employee went and told her we had been waiting for our bill. It still took her another 5 mins to even go get our bill ready because she was still too busy socializing. And when she dropped it off she just put on the table and walked away to go and socialize more.   Claudia was our server all 3 times."}
{"text":"\"Hot \" wings are not very hot. As an Arizona native I must say it lacks a zing!! 10/10"}
{"text":"If you care about your health, this location has dangerous practices in the kitchen. 1. My chicken parm consisted of cold chicken tenders with sauce and cheese and was slapped between 2 slices of bread (for $10 they could have at least tried to fake it)  2. There were 15 visible employees & it took them over 45 minutes to serve 3 plates of cold food (maybe half of those red shirts could have expedited food as soon as it was ready 3. The answer to whether or not i could charge my phone was No since \"the building is old.......\" ???? (i guess having 30 tvs plugged in at once is different).I used to go there for cheap wings, variety, and service and now I dont have any reason to compromise my health due to acts of negligence."}
{"text":"Came to watch the NBA finals and they definitely delivered on that aspect. Ordered the burger and it was a regular bar burger nothing special to talk about. Ice tea was not good. Our server Jenny was nice! Pretty loud but that would be expected."}
{"text":"I normally love this location! The food and service is top notch. But yesterday they failed! We ordered via the app at 4:30 for a pick up at 5(future order). When my husband arrived shortly before 5, the food wasn't supposedly ready yet so he waited a couple minutes(no big deal). We live across the street, when he got home, we opened the wings we both got and the free cookie sundae I got for my birthday. This is where the disappoint started. His boneless wings were lukewarm at best. My supposed buffalo ranch wings were dumped with the dry rub rather tossed nicely and they were cold! Not luke warm, COLD! I heated them up, and they didn't even taste like the buffalo ranch were supposed to taste like. And then to top off the mediocre meal, the cookie for the sundae was burnt. Black burnt.. horrible.."}
{"text":"I was told that since they changed from Native New Yorker that the quality had gone down. I still decided to give them a try. I was very surprised that the salads were VERY good. Usually salads (or anything healthy) at a place like this is an afterthought. Make sure you try the strawberry/walnut and Greek salad...AWESOME. I rated them 4 stars because the dry rub wings (Asiago and salt/vinegar (I think that was it)) were pretty bland."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm at work and my fiance and my friends went here, and got themselfs food and asked for mine to go....the waitress Missy took forever to get them their food and their drinks refilled, and she acted like she hated her job....if you don't like your job go somewhere else! My fiance asked for the New York Cookie Sundae I mean really this place is so pathetic they gave her a burnt as a crisp to where it was too hard to eat then the ice cream was put in a container, the picture comes with whipped cream, cherry and syrup, all she was given was ice cream and two burnt cookies! She spent $5 on cheap a** cookies we could have made at  home! She asked for my stuff to go and asked for ranch, she never got ranch, seriously how am I supposed to eat wings without ranch? She's lucky she got a tip with the Sh**** service they got I wouldn't have tipped a penny and I'm a server!  We had a party of 6 and all 6 of us are telling our friends how bad of an experience we had here.... Next time take care of your customers the first time, WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING unless we here this place has cleaned up it's act!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation. We got stuck in between booths and the wall. We had some football players with us, so it was a tight squeeze. I was first to be seated. My party dribbled in and now 20 mins had passed, no greeting, no water, nothing. I get up and ask hostess who our server is. She says she'll get someone. A server walks by, \"are you my server\" I asked with a dry mouth (it's 107 outside) \"no, but I'll find out\".  Now the booth that we are blocking with our large group, walks out. Hostess, and what appeared to be someone in management or acting like management, tried to get the guests to stay but they weren't having any of it. That's when the management person asked if we'd like drinks. THANK GOD. Half hour and our order finally taken. 25 mins later our food arrives.. everything came out at once and was hot. One sandwich came out with out a bottom piece of bread. Fried were forgotten but we were all together for the family dinner and this place is cleaner then the Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this location a lot when we lived in Ahwatukee. We were in the old hood and decided we wanted wings. Man, the flavor was great but the wings seemed to have shrunk tremendously. The table tents were sticky and the hostess told us it was happy hour but neither the hostess or waitress let us know what was on happy hour. TV's seemed to have multiplied and they are everywhere, even through out the dining room. A new wing place around the corner just opened and now regretting us not trying the new place. Same stale old joint. Yes joint. Not a restaurant."}
{"text":"This,is,one of the most disgusting restaurants I have ever eaten in! the noise Level and the.lighting is.like eating in WalMart. The Chicken wraps and Burgers are obviously filled with soy and cheap seasoning. my family And I,went home quite I'll after feeling like we had just been inflicted With a case of mild food poisoning. IF YOU WANT BAD FOOD AND BAD SERVICE THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR,YOU.it seemed Very dirty inside and quite unsanitary. THE BATHROOMS WERE  disgusting. this is not a good sign. do not waste up money or time. you will be very disappointed.I will never return!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The young female server was nice enough but extremely flustered and slow. She left us sitting there forever without asking if we are ready to order. Our appetizer of wings came with our food.... I left my bag with my iPhone charger in the booth and returned to ask about it. I was met with a rude dismissive hostess.  I'm pretty sure one of the employees took it. It had only been an hour, if that since I'd left and I doubt the nice latin woman who was sitting where I was sitting took it. It's almost as if they wanted to blame the diners."}
{"text":"okay here's the thing I looveeee native but when you give horrible service when there's only 4 people in the whole restaurant I can't give a good review. the wings were great but it took the lady 30 min just for a refill and even longer to come by just so I can tell her the ranch was very watery. I was very disappointed by the service and time it took for refills and our check.  I'll stick to going to the native in Goodyear."}
{"text":"We've had wings at other Native locations for years, and they're at least consistently decent.  Unfortunately not the case at their new location in Gilbert.  We ordered a few different flavors of both traditional and boneless wings, and all of them seemed like they had been cooked hours before, then just warmed up when tossed in the sauces.  There was no crunch, and the traditional wings were rubbery.  It was really gross and so disappointing, especially when I was craving wings.  We won't be back to this Native for sure."}
{"text":"Tried Native again after at least 2 years since my last visit, nothing's changed , what a disappointment. 55$ for 2 draft beers, 3 chicken wings, loaded frys that was a joke, I would have gotten more frys in a large order at McDs , so little cheese and sour cream you couldn't taste it, and invisible bacon . Small bowl of queso with chips.  The only thing good about this visit was the kind young waiter and the company, which I brought. Don't waste your time or hard earned money ."}
{"text":"Worse Kerioke ever!!!!! Rudest DJ. Slow service. Horrible food was delivered cold. Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"This location is a little out of the way for me but I have gone there twice for karaoke night.  It was a lot of fun and not too crowded.  The crowd is very friendly and not that intimidating for potential first time karaoke goers.    As always the food was great and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Great wings as usual.  The staff, though, was the key today.  Our server Hillary was fantastic.  She made sure that EVERYTHING came out perfectly.  Thanks Hillary, we will be back."}
{"text":"This location had under trained managers. Managers do not know alcohol serving laws. If you're from outta state do not go to this location they will hassle you when you try to order alcohol and if you do not have an AZ drivers license they will not serve you. Probably will never return to this restaurant. First and last time. Train your managers and educate them about the different state identifications and be more welcoming to people visiting from outta state.   Food was not that good. Our wings looked as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period of time."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are really good. However the staff is not very friendly. I'm guessing they're in a rush and just don't have time. I would recommend they hire people who know how to smile. And seriously, why scrimp on the celery sticks??? I seriously got 3 celery sticks with my dozen wings, extra salad and side. More celery sticks cost me 99 cents. Lmao - they just lost another star. And oh yeah she never refilled my water she just took my glass away. Sigh..."}
{"text":"This used to be such an awesome place. My ex-wife and I would come in here and get a plate of wings and a couple of beers and just love the food. Once they became a chain or franchise or whatever happened everything went downhill. I am here tonight and it's really not that good. My hot sauce and chips are not good. The hot sauce taste more like pizza sauce. The bartender is overworked even though things are slow. I hope my pizza is better than the service. Update my server just picked up the credit card I lay down and ask do you want to put your bill on this card. You can't make this stuff up LOL can't believe it, qmy pizza came out room temperature not hot not cold just room temperature. How does this place stay in business? Two women came up to the bar looked around and left. Probably time for a new GM"}
{"text":"Food is expensive and  lacks taste, creativity, and portions.  The only thing this place has going for it is the beer and apparently keeps alive with regulars who play trivia."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place multiple times hoping that it was just a \"bad night\" the last time they screwed up, but nothing changes. The last time I was there they had to remake my pizza THREE times! I ordered one of their specialty pizza's and asked for only half of it to have jalapeños. Not hard, right?! Well, somehow they just couldn't figure it out and had to remake my pizza over and over again. Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I will never come to this Native again. The service was terrible from customer service to drink to food. It took over 20 minutes to get our food and we only ordered a few wings, fries, and sliders. The food was over-seasoned, salty as hell; and our waiter had hardly come to the table. Never again."}
{"text":"Just moved to surprise, thought I would check this place out! The first time I came in I was met by Julia the bartender. She was very attentive and met all me requests very quickly!   I ordered boneless wings which were perfect, just the right amount of sauce.   Julia has a great smile, friendly attitude and that's the reason I keep coming back!   Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"Originally I was quite frustrated, we came in specifically for the potato skins which I ordered half with bacon half without because my fiancé cannot eat bacon with her food allergy. When the order arrives unfortunately the server explained the half without was an afterthought in the kitchen where they tried to pick off the bacon on a few pieces so we were asked if we would like them remade. When The new order arrived there actually was a large piece of fabric and string in the freshly made non-bacon versions. ( which we only received two that were split in half) when The manager brought them out I explained the situation about the food allergy. Anyhow at that point we were both quite flustered with the whole experience and lost our appetite. However I do want to give kudos to Mike the manager being that they ended up comping the entire meal. The server Nikki  was also quite respectful of the situation and was very attentive with her job. So overall I have mixed feelings but I will say they 100% redeemed themselves on a customer service side of things. I don't know if we will be returning anytime soon, which stinks because we live a mile down the road but I will say that they did everything properly on the backside."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this location again! I went in on a Friday afternoon with my two nephews, ages 10 and 7. My 7 yr. old nephew carried in his bag of lunch from McDonald's. We were seated in a booth; the waitress took our drink orders. Not a minute later the Manager (Brian) came over to our booth, seated himself next to my 10 yr. old nephew and inquired how our day was going.   The manager then proceeded to advise me, he normally would not allow outside food to be eaten in his restaurant. I understood and completely accepted his request. However he went on to state \"I will not kick you out this time! But next time you will know not to bring in outside food, which can cause food poisoning, and can be blamed on this restaurant\"!    I was shocked, this man would use the term \"Kick you out\" and refer to my nephew's food as possibly being poisonous.   He should have called me to the side and simply explained outside food if not allowed, and left it at that! My seven year old nephew (in fear of his potentially poisonous burger) asked \"Why is that man going to \"Kick\" us out? I simply greeted Manager Brian with a smile, and made a mental note never to return, and right this review!   Poor customer service, rude manager, verbally threatening to children and customers; I have a very young look about me, however I'm 36 yrs. old and deserve to be treated respectfully!"}
{"text":"We have been there 3 times since it opened.  Will Never go again.  Last Visit wad me and my daughter. We waited an hour for food and finally had to FIND the waitress who wad it the side door with her friend.  She got or food and it was ice cold.  Manager dais they could re cook it.  Really?? We just waited am hour, seem our waitress once and I walked to the drink station and filed my own drink! What a shame"}
{"text":"I come here on Tuesdays for the wings special. Thay have really great wings, and a pretty good selection of beer. Lots of TVs too. The only reason I wouldn't rate 5 stars is because often the service isn't the best. I wouldn't say they have bad service, and probably often times it's because the restaurant is busy, but I'm just not overly impressed, especially when sitting outside on the patio. Takes forever to get a server out there.   The decor and atmosphere are cool and they always play sports on the TVs, which is cool. I love Native, and I'll keep going there as long as they have great wings at a good price!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, but plan on spending a lot of time waiting to order, waiting for your food, waiting for your bill, then waiting to get paid out. I have no clue what the servers and cooks are doing that makes it take so long to get service."}
{"text":"Just Average   We were looking for a casual place to dine and grab a cold beer. After reading a few reviews, we decide to give Native Grill a try.   Native Grill is your basic \"sports bar\".  It's is a nice size bar, with plenty of TV's.   Native Grill offers various wing styles and flavors. On this visit we tried the Honey BBQ and the Asiago Parmesan Strippers, chicken bacon ranch flatbread, fried zucchini, and hamburger sliders.  I didn't particularly care for the chicken strippers or the sliders. The chicken strippers with drowned in sauce and the sliders were slightly overcooked and somewhat dry. However, the chicken bacon ranch flatbread and fried zucchini were delicious  The beer was cold and inexpensive, with a nice selection.  I think we may have caught the late evening Happy Hour.   Our waitress was polite and accommodating without being intrusive, and the service was good. I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Not what I expected   We were looking for a casual place to grab a quick lunch. After reading a few reviews, we decide to give Native Grill a try.   Native Grill is your basic \"sports bar\".  It's is a nice size bar, with plenty of TV's.   Native Grill offers various wing styles and flavors. On this visit we tried lunch special, burger and fries.  I didn't particularly care for the burger or fries. The bjrger was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry and the fries were slightly undercoomed.  Our server was polite and accommodating without being intrusive, and the service was good. I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Came here for food and karaoke, as well as fun with some great people. Got all of the above and then some, despite slow service to order our food. In the end it was fine though, because the good food we ordered more than made up for the slow service in placing our order. Diet Cokes, Buffalo Bleu Cheese Chips, Loaded Fries, & Boneless Chicken Wings were what we got and wow were they delicious! I am a sucker for Buffalo Bleu Cheese Chips, after having them at Gordon Biersch last month and these were just as good as theirs!  Karaoke was a blast and we all had a great time. We stayed until closing and sang a lot of great songs. Each of us has the love of music in common and it was awesome hearing what each of us loves to sing along to. Makes for good times and great fun, as does the whole Native New Yorker experience!  If you're looking for a great place to check out sports events on tv, have a night out  doing karaoke, or just come for great food and awesome people, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I agree... I remember it being better.  But I also remember when wings were 25 cents each on tuesdays.  You can still get away with a six dollar dozen of wings so no complaints here.  The salt & pepper wings are the best when they are super hot.  My mouth is watering thinking about them... they sound gross but they are perfect.  Crunchy, flavorful.  We tried the salt & vinegar last night & liked them a lot -- if you're in the mood for tangy, try them out.  I'm also a big fan of salt & vinegar chips sooo that might explain my affection.  Asiago parmesan was also on our list... they were decent.  Not as parmesan-y as I wanted... is that a word?  Our server was alright... he seemed really overwhelmed & it took him a while to take our order.  But then was on top of it.    If I ask for extra veggies, why does one single sad strip of celery go down on my plate?  Is this some sort of mean Native New Yorker joke?  Just wondering..."}
{"text":"This place has horrible bar service. Pulled up a coupon off yelp. Said they don't offer that anymore. So take the damn thing off. Why I came to begin with. I give  They still have coupons on yelp. They don't honor them. Bartender Yvette is the problem. Extremely inconsiderate!!  No person of any gender or race will be rude to me when I'm paying them! If had one complaint at my resturaunt about customers being treated with disrespect. They would be gone in a heart beat!! The fact that I even took the time to write this means I'm irradiated !"}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for some time now. It's my go to native . My boys love the pizza :) the wings are awesome I suggest the honey hot ! So good !"}
{"text":"Giving Native New Yorker 5 stars for one reason.  They stepped up and hosted the rally for the Save the Coyotes coalition.   Bravo....great job for helping out fans of a valley sports team that is in trouble and needs to stay in the valley.   Will patronize them whenever I am in that area....they proudly stepped up for the fans (and did a great job with the crowds) and now I will return the favor.   One thing to say to Native New Yorker: THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!   The girls that work in the front have horrible attitudes; they have not been properly trained on how to communicate with customers. Once seated, my wait for my alcoholic beverage was ridiculous. I had to keep asking my server who would say \"blame the bartender\". Food must have been ready for awhile due to it not being hot nor warm. Chicken is always over fried. Most pieces are just crispies with no meat. Avondale location is horrid!"}
{"text":"I get confused when the name of the place changed from Native New Yorker to Native Grill & Wings....  yet the reviews are still under NNY.  We have eaten here since 1979 where it all started in Tempe.  We have noticed the wings seem to get smaller and smaller as time goes by.  Maybe they are Cornish Game Hen wings or pigeon wings but hey, we have NEVER seen wings that small!  They taste good but you need at least twice the number to fill up.  My previous review was 5 stars but that was many years ago, how sad.  Goodbye NNY/NGW, sad to see you change like that."}
{"text":"Wali, Chris and Obey made our entire night. We just moved here and will be coming back at least once a week because of these three. They gave us amazing customer service and made us feel like family. I wish more restaurants had employees like them. This place has a warm, family feeling, but you can still drink and have a good time. Good job, Native."}
{"text":"Sucked. I won't be back.  I can get a chicken parm sandwich like this from my daughter's cafeteria at school for a lot less than $11.  Dirty bar, slow service , no napkin, old soft reheated fries.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"How hard is it to provide even decent service? It's completely inconsistent, can clearly see one of the servers working hard while ours of course is nowhere to be seen. Food is decent and it's a good atmosphere for football. We continue to come back occasionally for football season and are always disappointed with the service. Maybe we'll try buffalo wild wings up the road."}
{"text":"Dam.... went in for a takeout order around 11. Sum dude going table to table  asking people for a ride to east mesa...  when i told him NO he then ask for money ...the bartender  and manager see and hear it and didn't even care... very uncomfortable...."}
{"text":"Garbage pizza was great, as always. My kids also liked the wings. Appetizer didn't arrive until after our dinner, but they did not charge us for it, which was appropriate. Salad a disappointment, but all other food items very good. Our server, Mariana, was excellent. She had a kind disposition and checked with us often enough without being intrusive.  She kept our drinks filled throughout the evening."}
{"text":"I love hot wings, and these ones are amazing if you like them tiny and overcooked.  I'm beside myself with how awful the service was. The server dropped my large beer on top of another large beer, and the two glasses shattered, and beer and glass exploded all over us. It was a huge mess, we all got a beer/glass shower, and my phone was completely submerged in a beer puddle. We had 11 people and kids, and had to clean up ourselves and the glass, which was everywhere. The staff didn't move us to a clean table or offer to put in our food order in a timely manner. When we finished and the server brought the check, he didn't offer anything (a discount, free dessert, etc.; I waited tables for years and it's nothing for a restaurant to give freebies and make customers happy so they'll come back again) to make sure we didn't leave unhappy. I spoke to the manager, who seemed to care more about showing off her tattoo sleeves than happy customers. Ugh. I'd give this place negative stars if I could, for the sub-quality food, awful service, the manager's inability to correct a bad situation (we aren't impossible customers), and having to pull shards of glass out of everything while we ate. I can't wait to never go back here!"}
{"text":"I only give it 2 stars  - but I give the wait staff and bartenders 5 stars - they are awesome!! But the food is too salty, the bathrooms are reminiscent of a truck stop, and the 3 nights a week karaoke is painful. Give us a DJ, please! The busiest nights for a sports bar are only afforded one bartender which makes zero sense. This bar/restaurant could be so much - and just isn't. The West Side needs some good night life - step up to the plate!"}
{"text":"This place was empty and it took almost an hour to get our food and the manager wanted to argue with us about how long we have been here... Fairly apparent the waitress didn't put our order in and he was trying to cover.  Worst part two of the items were salads... Skip it not worth the wait! Manager didn't do anything about the service and the waitress was unapologetic.  People who came in 30 minutes after us got their food in under 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Came on a busy night and sat with Claudia. The food was delicious and the service was even better. Great experience."}
{"text":"Walked out of this place. This is the only location that no longer does the \"strippers\" chicken Wednesday special, they moved it to Tuesday & Thursday. The wing sauces also taste completely different than other locations."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night and the wait was 20 minutes, which is pretty typical for most places on a weekend. Our server was pleasant. The food is always okay, but just okay. I'm always a little disappointed. It's just not outstanding. I had the California Cluck. I could make something better (and probably faster) at home. They have made their portions smaller from the past and upped the prices. It's an okay place, but not one I ever crave or would choose to go to unless my only other option was McDonald's."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and got the wings.  They were not that great.  not much breading on the wings and tasted so-so.  Probably wont order wings here again.  Like the ones at Chili's better."}
{"text":"Best wings, fish and chips, pizza, happy hour!  Best community support!  Thx Denise and Native for the support of HHS wrestling!  Support and service and food reminds us why we choose to be regulars!!!!!!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great bartenders. Immediately walk in and leon knows what you want if your a regular here. Its always a comfortable enviroment and relaxing. Food is always deleicious and they are all respectful and keep you accomadated with their service"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. I frequented the Val Vista and Elliot location pretty often and loved, their wing specials but ever since it closed down I've had to try other places. I'm not sure if they still have them but the quality of food sure has come down a bit. The past 2 times I've been here my wings came out a colder than I expected. If i had to rate it, I would say that it was colder than luke-warm but still edible. The service has always been good though so no complaints there. I can't say if I would recommend NNY over a place like Buffalo Wild Wings but its definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"This place can't handle a Sunday evening. (Assuming)  Pizza came out cold!  Wings never made it out!   This place is just as bad as the previous breakfast place    Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We ate here again and they have their act together now.  Service was good  - the food was ALWAYS good.  I'll be going here more often since it is somewhat near my house.  Nice outdoor area that is shaded from the sun late in the day and has fans.  Could be really nice as the summer goes on."}
{"text":"We stopped by to grab a beer and get some food at the bar. We sat and it felt like there had been a low rider car show and this NATIVE was the location for the after party. So we decided to drink our beers and take our food to go. Bartender was slow, she had no help but manager was great, he presented our food and opened the wings and pizza we ordered to make sure we were happy with it! Kudos to the manager of the night. The girls that worked there gave each other faces and the stink eye! None of them seemed to want to help one or the other! Sad! One word.... HOOD! You want to be around people live in the 90's thinking gangsta is in style this is your place! HOOD! Food and drink specials always great the people who go to this location...HOOD!"}
{"text":"5 adults, 3 teens, 3 children. FATHER's DAY 45 minutes after ordering, still no food, had as for manager. When food arrived cold, tastless, but at 8:15, we ate it.  No one asked how was.  Had to ask for ticket, yes they charged us full price.  Had to wave down manager to get bill even. NO STARS."}
{"text":"Great service by Vanessa, she was very friendly and supplied us with everything we requested."}
{"text":"We had the stripper wings and regular wings honey BBQ are yummy. Only downfall is that it takes forever to get your food"}
{"text":"This place is a nice place come in out of the heat to enjoy a chat with some friends and have some drinks and appetizers for their happy hour. The staff is attentive and a chill crowd. This is the unwinding spot...."}
{"text":"Been there several times since they opened. Often find the music to loud in the dining area for lunch or early evening. Hard to talk over it if with friends. Today wanted to catch lunch before shopping. Arrived at 11 sharp according to my watch. This style restaurants usually open at 10:30. Doors were locked and I got attention of someone inside who opened the door and told me they did not open until 11.She said according to their clock it was 10:47. Floors were still being mopped and chairs were still on top of tables.I could tell this was not starting out well so I left. This is a good indication of a management problem. I went to nearby Freddie's and spent my money. While there I could view the Native lot. Not many cars. I hope management of this restaurant does not create a disaster because it would be unfair to the owners and the city."}
{"text":"A party of five, we were seated quickly but waited nearly 30 minutes before we decided to walkout. No acknowledgment at all by no one. Very poor customer service and will not return there at all... There are lot of restaurants that are willing to take me monies."}
{"text":"Place is fantastic, always get great service and the food is always awesome.  Falcone was awesome, friendly, personable and took the time to make us feel welcome.  We really enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"What a joke of a sports bar!!!  Service sucks!!  Its dead in here and watched a waitress leave dirty dishes on a table for three visits. Finally the customers asked the manager to take them away. Lol. Ordered wings app. They came out 20min later at same time as burger!! Last time at this joke of a sports bar! .....ok so. Eric the asst.GM noticed my discontent and came over to apologize.  I respect that tremendously so i changed my review from one to three stars.  I want this place to be GOOD since it is right behind my house!!  I will give it one more shot.  Management gets 5stars!"}
{"text":"So I did a delivery order on Friday night it was totally wrong when I received it. But when I called they said they would give me full credit. So tonight I called the manager said he totally remembered my order and that so I would not have to pay more he delivered it himself... wow top notch service thanks since I was not able to pick up!! And tonight food was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I'm back at the old watering hole once again, I really enjoy this establishment, It's like visiting family.  Everyone is treated like a regular here, the food and beverages are a plus also."}
{"text":"Wings have gone to sh*t. Ordered hot,  but the sauce was easy too salty,  the other half was honey mustard, wings only half covered in sause.. overall very disappointed"}
{"text":"Our first time here....food was good and atmosphere was also good. We had 12 wings and a small pizza.   Service a little slow but not horrible . There are plenty of TVs to watch and the prices are reasonable.   We will be back especially before or after a movie."}
{"text":"Native  New Yorker in Tempe was OK, I had not been to this location in several years and was waiting for a friend that lives near this location.   I know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.  Everything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.  I will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Very good wings, very fast service at the bar. Service was good. Rennae was excellent"}
{"text":"I've come to this Native New Yorker for a few years now and I must say, the wings taste better and better every time I come. The wings are so moist and tender that it falls right off the bone. I love the asiago and honey hot, those are my must have wings when we're here and the spinach artichoke dip is by far the best I've ever had.    Customer service has always been either horrible or just plain \"ok\". I've never had stellar customer service here, but we continue to come because of the food."}
{"text":"Service has always been great in the bar area only. We've honestly stopped coming since they re-did the menu and switched everything up to make it more family oriented. It's no longer our go to sports bar that's for sure. They decreased the portion size of their appetizers. Blue cheese & the dressing on the buffalo chips is over cooked and gives it a spiderweb look that just sticks to the plate. We tried the whole take-out scenario only to be disappointed. The girls in the front never seem to know what's going on. I was told 15 minutes for pick up. I got there right at the end of that time frame only to wait another 30 minutes before I finally said SCREW IT! It was 3 in the afternoon on a Wednesday- they aren't busy! There's no excuse."}
{"text":"The DH and I find ourselves here almost every Saturday afternoon.  We like to sit at the bar since we always have great conversations and incredible service from the bartender Ashley.  She always knows our preferences and is quick to request a redo if the kitchen presents her with anything less than what she would be proud to serve.  The managers are great and I cannot say we have ever had less wonderful experience while at a table with the family or at the bar top."}
{"text":"What qualifies them to call themselves \"Native New Yorker\"?  What does peddling cheap batches of taste-impaired wings, crunchy pizza and nacho platters have to do with New York?  Or even \"New Yorker\"? Where's the man in the fancy hat that serves me my wings? What, you don't have one? Then again, I ask, what's \"New York\" about you?  A checkered tablecloth and some black and white photographs? Oh wow, a picture of an old automobile.   Get the fuck out of town.  .50 extra for a cup of ranch? Have you the brain worms? What, has there been a ranch dressing famine?   And not to be picky here, but usually, you're supposed to wait for the cheese to melt before you serve the smothered fries. Is that why I'm paying the .50 per ranch? Is your \"shredded cheese heating machine\" broken?   Does New York know you're up to this?"}
{"text":"Vanessa is the best . Oh!!  and the food is good . Friendly service and good people . Good improves every day ."}
{"text":"Below avg food, too high happy hours prices, not enough variety in draft options and in the five worst table service ever, EVER received! What a waste of an evening!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time a couple of weeks ago to watch a Kings game, which let me just say is HARD out here in AZ. We sat at the bar and were helped immediately. The bartender let us know that they usually play all hockey games due to having the NHL package, so we will be back! The wings were great and so were the refills of our beers!"}
{"text":"service was as expected.  food was as expected as well.  we ordered an app of \"loaded fries\" which is a misnomer for sure.  they should have bacon on them and the two separate times we ordered them i would say they had a small sparse sprinkling of bacon bits scattered on top.  very sad.  what is it about places skimming on the bacon.  it's the greatest meat ever.  don't be cheap with it or don't advertise your food has bacon on it!  our server was very good and very attentive which compensated for the meh food"}
{"text":"Love their wings. I mean LOVE them. Cool atmosphere and always friends staff. Pizza is so so. But the wings are the best around"}
{"text":"Came here the day after thanksgiving. The place was dead, maybe 10 tables full total. Only one staff member in the entire restaurant. Our wings took over 45 minutes. Drinks weren't refilled ever, and our party's burger was served with no condiments, even after we asked for them."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly and attentive, food is always good, I love this place, haven't been in couple months but I had to post this today as I was reminded of how good this place is after visiting the one on Bell and 73th ave,,,, cuz this very last one was a horrible experience...."}
{"text":"I wish they have zero, it was my worst experience ever, two thumbs down for this one, I had to wait a long time, finally I was told that I have to get 4 sauces for the order of 24 wings, I said that I wanted 5, the waiter obviously was pissed and came back to tell me that his manager said we can do only two!!! I asked why, he said the kitchen is packed, and that's of course after the long wait, the service was very poor, after arguing with the waiter I had to cancel, he didn't even apologize or anything, just ran and this time he was fast, brought me the bill in which I was charged for the coke!!!!!! There is just a lot of stress that happened, I can't list all the details, bottom line,, DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Extra crispy Honey hot wings are the best and so are the loaded fries. My kiddos love them. It's kid friendly so you don't have to worry if they get a bit loud."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night. It was busy in both the bar and the dining room. The service was attentive, but the food was terrible. The water, too.  The water was absolutely disgusting. We know Phoenix's water is gross, but there is something extra specially disgusting in the water in that neighborhood. For a restaurant to serve water that bad leaves me speechless.   I started with a side salad. It was a bed of lettuce and some grated cheese. For $8, I expected more. Onion or tomato, maybe? A mushroom?   I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. I was completely perplexed by my dish. The first thing I noticed was that it looked like it had sat under the lamps too long. But we ordered it 5 or 6 minute prior. The dish was hot, but the top of the food was lukewarm. Under the film that had developed on the top of the lukewarm-ish-ness of the dish it was warm, but not hot. Again, it was perplexing. It looked like the Costco Chicken Parmesan was served on my plate, but it wasn't as good. It was bland, and flat, and had no flavor.   My gf ordered the Fish & Chips. She said that they were \"mediocre\". The fish was average, and bland. The breading was bland, and too greasy. Nothing at all like the Fish & Chips at Four Peaks. I had a bite of the Cole Slaw, and liked it, though.  My gf's son ordered the mini burgers from the Kids' Menu. When I looked at the burger, it looked like something was amiss. I opened the bun, and looked at the burger. The cheese looked like the burger had been cooled, and re-heated. It was gross. The burger was like a rock. Bland. Overcooked. No texture. No condiments with the burger. He's 6, but even he knows that a burger should have some condiments with it. He ate 2 bites, and gave me the, \"Really? Do I have to eat this?\" look.   The only reason this place is a 2 is because we were in a hurry, and they worked to accomodate our schedule. I wouldn't even call the service particularly \"GOOD\", it was good enough to get us in and out in a timely fashion.   A decent family restaurant in the West Valley still eludes us. It's a shame that there are so many lazy, uninspired, unmotivated chefs in the industry. Are they even Chefs at this level, or do the owners throw a hodge podge of illegals into the back and call it good?   We will not go back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, and while they were not busy I didn't get to eat! I sat there for 30 to 40 minutes waiting! I saw groups that arrived after me get their order first. I ordered 10 wings. The most upsetting part about it, was speaking to the \"manager\" and hearing her tell me that the actual wait time was 9 minutes!!! I was pissed, because now she was basically telling me that I exaggerated. She tells me she will look at the cameras and then call me back. Really girl! Just look at these reviews! You have a problem! Excessive wait time is should not be the norm, and it's unprofessional that you all can't apologize. I will never come to this location again!"}
{"text":"Just went into native first time since opened.  Food was great service was great.  Our server Stephanie was busy but made sure she checked on us frequently and made sure everything was good.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"Ate there on 5/11/2014 the wings were not very hot and not as tasty as wing stop, three in our party had burgers and I had the sliders all were dry and flavorless like ground up cardboard, cooks must have had anything close to seasonings removed from their presence,at least a little salt and pepper would be a plus.Don't think we will be back,but the fries did have good flavor and were not cold."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Appetizer came out the SAME time as the entrees. No refills. Only 3 tables in the whole dining room. Our server never came over to check on our food either. Overall one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. If your servers hate their job as much as he did, just send him home until he changes his attitude."}
{"text":"Lindsy was GREAT!!!! Her customer service was AMAZING. She kept relaxed and happy. Thanks Lindsy"}
{"text":"Great wings. Great service. Had the .49 wing special they are now doing on Sunday's. Love the atmosphere. Definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad but it is hit or miss on the service. Sometimes it's great and other times you are trying to flag the waitress down for service."}
{"text":"Well, I stopped in here after taking my sons to the movie theater near by. I am a big fan of the wings at NNY. I thought this visit was going to be like the rest...however that was not the case. One of my pet peeves about this place is that they serve pizza on the pizza stands but there is never enough room on the table for the stand, plates, drinks and other food that may be ordered. It was like we had to constantly shift dishes to pass wing plates to each other.  Another pet peeve about this place is there are only 2 good waitresses. The others are spacey and unprofessional.  The space for the family friendly part of the restaurant is small and they packed too many tables into it. It felt like I was really back in NY at a pizza joint. I sent my son in the mens bathroom to use the bathroom like I normally do. But this time he came out with his pants wet. At first I thought he wet himself, but then when I peeked into the mensroom, I saw that one if the urinals was clogged and flooding the floor. I told the hostess at the front and she said she would tell someone. I went to the back to pack our food up because we had to leave. It took me about 15 minutes to pack our food and wait for the check. Why is it that whenever it's time for the check, the waitress is always no where to be found?! Anyway, I told the waitress about the bathroom as well. I was really bummed that we had to leave early because of my sons pants being wet with other men's urine on them. Otherwise, the food (pizza and wings) was good as usual. The service could have been better."}
{"text":"Yes at times the level of service may fluctuate depending on how busy they are but it hasn't stopped me from coming back again, and again nor has it stopped my kids from requesting it on family night!  You cant beat the prices and the wings and drinks are always fresh and pleasing.  You can come hang at the bar and even do a lil karaoke. Or you can bring the fam and watch a game on any one of the hundred tv's on the walls.  My favorite drink is the \"Liquid Marijuana\"  and my fav wing flavors are spicy honey mustard, asiago parm and bar b que HOT! Matter fact Im about to go eat there right now! I love this place. Maybe the problem is YOU, ever think about that? LOL #some people are just hard to please"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience, sat at the bar and the service was immediate and memorable! I believe the bartender's name was Julia, if you're there when she is you're guaranteed a great evening."}
{"text":"California burger and garbage pizza were both very tasty and priced right. Able to seat ourselves which was a nice touch. Quite a number of TV's but not too awful loud which was nice. Great prices, and really good service. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Walked into the bar, every table was dirty with dishes from guest who have already left.(and most never got cleaned off the entire time we were there) Had to sit at a not wiped down bar top. Bar tender started off great, but after the luke warm food arrived she would disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time, and no it was not busy. Had to get our on silverware and ask two different times for other servers to find the bartender to come back for refills. At the end of the meal sat for another 10 minutes waiting on the bartender to come back, with empty drinks and dirty plates, to get our check. The restaurant was overall dirty and messy. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker has great prices for wings. There are a lot of choices too. The place is packed with college students since it's so close to ASU. The waitress was nice and there are so many TVs!  However, I did not like the wings. The wings are fried so they are very greasy. If you are suffering from obesity, high cholestrol, or heart problems, don't come here.  I also added a picture of my meal."}
{"text":"Wings are always good. A little unhappy with the change. I use to buy 6 wings and get 2 flavors now they sell wings in bunches of 5. For dessert their hot cookie with ice cream on top good but they reduced the amount of ice cream. Would have a pic but my kid digged into it too quick ate the ice cream in one bite."}
{"text":"Great time tonight sitting out by the fire and drinking. Our bartender, Ashley, made the night perfect. She is the example of excellent service with a friendly touch. Thanks, Ashley. You made Friday and great day!!!"}
{"text":"$.49 cent per wing on Tuesdays and Thursdays - that's what brought me here when I had a HUGE craving for wings. Well, the place didn't do anything for me. The service was very mediocre. I even made a comment to my girlfriend about how lousy the waitress was. The loaded potato skins were delicious, though. They only brought out one tinyyyyy thing of sour cream, which irritated me. How do you only use one spoon of sour cream for SIX half potatoes? Fat girl annoyances!  I guess that's what you get when your bill only comes out to $8.00. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"If it was an option to leave y'all NO STARS I would. I have never had such shit service EVER. AMY was rude and NOT attentive. It wasn't really unexplainable. The manager actually made our table happy again but Amy was the worst. We love native too so that's too bad. It's the only one close to us. Anyways we won't return if Amy is still there but we will check back in a month or so. We won't loose hope YET."}
{"text":"Since this place has been remodeled it has a different feel to it, but not in a bad way, the bar is now the big hot spot in the restaurant. The food is still really good and the service has its ups and downs, but I am glad that it re-opened."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona to visit my friend from high school and go to PHX Lights. I stopped by this place for a quick bite to eat, and I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and tasty food. The server, Tyler, and the manager, Denise, were incredibly friendly and made this a great pit stop for my vacation out here. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for easy comfort food and value drinks."}
{"text":"Nice server was nice even though over worked. She had little to no help. Food was pretty terrible. Wings were dry, salad was wilted, silverware was dirty. The manager needs to get their Sh*t together."}
{"text":"Great service and food  Byron rocks kudos for his service he gave us! We never wanted for anything!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good.  Also, try the mandarin orange wings, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food took forever. Came out cold. Waitress was rude and made the excuse that since I had a big party of 6 people and it was a busy night (which it wasn't at all- they were probably just short staffed) it was our fault the food came out cold. Not going to this location again."}
{"text":"Where to start.... we sat on the patio (because the inside smells like the floor is mopped with stale beer), which I don't recommend unless you like sitting in the dark and breathing in second hand smoke constantly. We waited patiently for a server until it became ridiculous. I called over one I saw who said we were not his table but he would take our drink order. I asked what they had on draft and he said \"all of them\"? I mentioned that if we had menus I could look myself but WE DIDN'T. Appetizers came pretty quickly by the entrees took about 30-40 minutes. When they arrived (chicken strips) they were cold and chewy. The glasses the drinks came in were dirty and we had to ask for utensils. This was our third trip to this location but it will definitely be our last."}
{"text":"This Native is one of the best. The bar has good service and a great crowd, especially on game nights. I really like the service in the dining room. The drinks are on point and the food is good. I will definitely be nah"}
{"text":"First of all, they offer military discounts!! Yeayy and thank you for honoring what so many other places do not. ;-)  I did a call-in order and forgot to say \"naked strips\" so I accidentally ordered breaded and fried strips. I didn't realize this until I was paying, and was thinking \"oh crap\" because I don't eat fried foods. Misti who I ordered with and the Manager Romone immediately offered to redo my order at no cost so that I do not compromise my diet! I felt so bad and apologized to them and even asked if it was ok being that it was my fault and I now just wasted their food, but they were soooo nice and accommodating, set me up in a booth with free drinks while I waited for my yummy naked grilled chicken strips! I cannot express enough gratitude for this as no other place would've been so kind and accommodating, or care about my \"meal plan\" or healthy eating preferences. Very amazing customer service!   The interior is nice and comfortable, great vibe and environment, and as I was able to observe the other staff while waiting, I had to give a review as the staff here are outstanding and treat their tables and customers with service. Thank you Misti and Romone! I will definitely be back (and I will get my order right next time!). Lol"}
{"text":"So glad they are open again. We go in weekly..or  more to have a good time after a long day. The staff is great and we enjoy a variety of foods. I like the wedge and wings or a burger. My grandson loves the pizza and cookie pie. Whatever we have comes out quickly and well prepared. We'll be coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's just average food compared to what's around Gilbert. Tastes like I heated up some stuff from the freezer section at Sam's Club. Fun bar food, just very average. There were lots of newly trained, very young servers the night we went, service was slow and it was hard to get drink refills. It would be cool if Native gave their kitchen more rope to create something unique but this is definitely an old school corporate restaurant.  We ordered Buffalo Nachos but there was not a lot of food on the plate."}
{"text":"Fairly good service, excellent wings as usual, and a decent selection of brew. All in all not the best location, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Service was pretty much non existent and food was mediocre. Our server seemed to be annoyed with us needing refills or anything else."}
{"text":"$2.25 Bloody Marys by Tina...GREAT!  Michael did a great job as server.  Good times and good food.  Can't wait to get back.  Fun place!"}
{"text":"Liz the waitress was GREAT!  She did a wonderful job. We had a party of 12 and she was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Before you waste your time and money going here, give heed to my warnings and learn from my mistakes!  First of all, their Chickens must be on a diet.  Compared to Buffalo Wild Wings, they are about a half of the size and you need to purchase a drink at NNY in order to get the 49-cent traditional wing special price on Tuesdays & Thursdays.  As if that's not enough, my 22oz lukewarm beer was brought to me in a room-temperature glass with a curly black hair on the sipping rim.  My wife was given carbonated water without syrup when she ordered a Sprite.  As pleasant as these drinks sound, they arrived over 10 minutes after we were seated.  Maybe the delay accounts for the strategic placement of the hair between the bartender's quick restroom break and the delivery of another beer?  Perhaps not, but it sure looked like a pubic hair!  As for the flavor of the wings, be prepared to be unsatisfied (especially if you've been to Buffalo Wild Wings).  For instance, the Strawberry Hot wings taste like they are marinated in IHOP strawberry syrup and the Mandarin Orange wings taste like they are as plain as can be.  As a side note, I've also tried to come here before with a group of friends for Karaoke on Saturday night, only to be told that the Karaoke equipment wasn't working.  I'm sure there's more, but that's probably enough for you to get the picture.  If you are staying at the nearby hotels or if you are looking for something in the area, just go straight to the Yardhouse at Westgate for an unforgettable Happy Hour!  Update: I've been here a few more times for cheap beers and/ or their lousy wings.  Buffalo Wild Wings is now open at Westgate and is a much better option for wings (especially on Tuesday and Thursdays for 60 cent specials)."}
{"text":"To be fair to this establishment, this review is only about their wings. I've been going to Tuesday night wings for years at this Ahwatukee location. My last time was about 2 weeks ago. At one point a couple years ago, we started complaining about the size of the wings. Then at one point, much later after complaints,  they got larger wings. Things seemed to be on track again. The last few times I've been in there, the wings were unbearably small and the prices have only going up. I think I'm finally done with going in for wings on Tuesdays & Thursdays. The amount of boneless wings has seemed to have shrunk also. I didn't have a scale to weigh them on, but it seemed like 1/2 lb is not 1/2 lb anymore. I can't comment on the rest of their food at this time as Tuesday wings have been our routine staple. I'm done with wings there until I hear it has gotten better. I can say the service has always been great though."}
{"text":"Since I've moved to Tempe, this has been my 'Primary Native'. And I must say. The Service is Great, the food is good, and the drinks are on point! The Patio Area is nice for those evening/night dinners. I also love how this one puts all of the wings on one plate instead of giving you plates for every flavor. As for the Company itself, I miss the old days where they had 39 cent wings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I don't like the fact that now (on a regular day) you have to get 1 flavor per 6 wings."}
{"text":"Okay, since I was looking to find a quick bite after shopping at Cabela's, I decided to give this place a chance for redemption.  I admit I noticed a change in atmosphere, which is good. My party and I came in on a Tuesday which is the wing special. Service was excellent and the wings were good. But I noticed they now have some kind of rules to ordering wings now. Apparently, customers can no longer have a \"special request\" for wing orders (No sloppy and/or \"naked\" wings\". No legs only, which I've never requested.) Since it was slow enough, the server agreed to have my wings a little \"Sloppy\". I understand that wings will never go back to 39cents per wing on Tuesdays and Thursday's like the good ol' days, but limiting a customers request on they want their wings is like saying they can't have a steak cooked how they want it (IMO).  This location has improved some, and I will be back when I'm on that side of town, looking for a quick bite. But I still won't make the long trip from Tempe like I used to."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times. The first time was great! The wait staff was friendly and the wings were great. However, the three times after that I had horrible wait staff, was ignored by the manager, and the food was lacking at best."}
{"text":"Me and 3 other friends were watching the Heat vs. Spurs game. Server was great, unfortunately i did not get her name. As we waited to get our food we saw a cockroach on our table. I grabbed my beer and smashed it. I asked our server politely for the manager. When the manager Amanda came up she said hi and I told her politely that we had a cockroach on our table and that i had killed it with my beer glass. She said \"I am so sorry. Were you guys planning on leaving?\" I told her no then she brought me another beer. Right then I should had left! I have been in the hospitality business for many years. If I was a manager I would automatically think to tell my guest... \"I apologize for the inconvenience, would you like to be seat else where, We will go ahead and take care of your food tonight\" or at least something to make me happy. Amanda asked again were you guys planning on leaving and I said \"no, but is there anything you can do for us?\" At this point I was turned off by her management skills. Amanda clearly said \"what would work for you?\" I was shocked and speechless! I asked her if there was anyway for her to give us a discount. There was no management skills in this person what so ever. We got 25% off and she never came back to the table to see how everything was going. Amanda walked in front of us twice after the fact. It takes one minute to ask how the rest of our dinner was going. Bad Management at this place. I recommend finding a new manager!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings but prefer the strippers! Tons of flavors, weekly specials, reverse happy hour and generally no issues when ordering online, phone or dining in. Service is quick and food is hot, can't ask for more in your neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Seriously lame burger.  Iceberg lettuce, low quality bun, devoid of taste patty.  I haven't had a burger this bad for ages ... Kinda like the ones you get at one of the sporting events downtown.  To make things worse, its priced like a gourmet burger.  Also only comes with a small handful of fries.  If you come here, go with their signature food ... The wings.  Avoid most everything else."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings yet !!! We had the loaded tots and they did not disappoint I mean loaded bacon, sour cream, onions ect. The server Jaclyn was very nice and friendly always refilled our beverages made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Excellent little slice of heaven,highly recommend to friendly people who like good food and eat it up till your full and all that stuff. Its good food go try it"}
{"text":"1. The place for wings in Tempe. 2. Wings not as big and not served as hot as ahwatukee location. 3. Plenty of TVs with sports, good service."}
{"text":"Tasty wings, plentiful beer, and good place to watch games.  The men seem to love this place.  It can sometimes be a challenge to find a seat on the patio but if you can, it is so much better than the restaurant (unless it is 110 degrees, of course).  They bring in all the games, so I can watch my Longhorns when I am in Tempe."}
{"text":"I've been a native customer for some time, mostly in Maricopa which, btw, has a great staff that almost always does a good job of attending to your wants. The wait staff at this location unfortunately does not do the same, mostly young looking kids who pretty much don't know squat about multi-tasking and being attentive to the customer. If you are going to sit outside in the patio area you should probably try to sit right at the bar where you can get your drinks sooner and not have to wait like 15 minutes for someone to come and take your order. As far as food goes, the wings are always awesome, my favorites being honey hot and asiago parmesan and the strippers, which are chicken strips sold by the half or full pound. Sandwiches are pretty good, but the pizza reminds me too much of food chain pizza, which of course it is. Overall though, its a pretty good place to have a bite and sip a few drinks."}
{"text":"This is my first and last visit to this establishment they have disabled parking at the back so far away from the front is untrue then double doors to get in saving grace is it large area inside that inables you to move around"}
{"text":"Pretty good everything taste great especially the wings and pizza, I defiantly loved the different wing flavors like salt and vinegar. The tater tots is a wholeeee different story - I can go here just for the tots, they are outstanding. The service is pretty \"ok\" depending on who your waiter is or what time it is but overall the place is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I love Native Grill but this one was the worst one. We were seated right away but no received no service. The waiter seen us seating there and ignored us. We had to leave because no one wanted to help us. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Had not been to Native in three years since moving to CA Excited about going on a trip to Phoenix  Had wings Wings were ok but not as good as we had remembered  Location and space were good Service was ok but a little slow"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I used to come here as a kid twenty-five years ago and the food is no where what it used to be. They need Bar Rescue to save this place and bring it back to what it used to be. Do not get the Flatbread pizza. It is dripping with grease and the sauce might as well have a gallon of vinegar in it. The mozerella sticks look like they've been purchased from the grocery store and frozen multiple times. The wings are okay, but nothing like they used to be. Oh and they really need to being the cheese and crackers back."}
{"text":"We had our Annual Christmas party at Native Grill and wings and it was FANTASTIC!!!! If you have a large or small party and are looking for amazing food and service, then look no further! Anthony and William did an amazing job taking care of all 54 of our guests, kudos to all of the staff!"}
{"text":"Been craving honey hot wings and Native is the place to go. However, today's visit was a complete fail. Although my service was good, the food was very poor and disappointing.  I order a dozen wings with 2 different sauces. The honey hot was good, however the medium wings were minus the sauce, completely!!!! The carrots were the saddest carrots ever. Completely dried out with bad spots.  I did ask for a side of extra sauce for my dried out wings and it was given without charging me but that's not the way the wings should be served."}
{"text":"Arrived with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon and they weren't so busy. They brought us the menus and no waters. They asked if we were going to have alcoholic drinks and we said yes. Then we were asked to provide ids (normal) until they asked us to fill out a form because we were under 30. This form would include our name, drivers license number, date of birth, then our signature. I do not mind providing this information, but my issue was that now my personal information was going to be on a paper that anyone can see and take a picture of. I could see other people's information that were there before me.....  We finally ordered our drinks (still no waters) they took about 15 minutes to come out and we still had not even placed our order and had been checked on before the drinks came out. We decided to leave because we figured that it would take even longer to get our food. I will not be returning to this location. However the waitress did acknowledge at the end that they took long and apologized.   Don't order the Moscow mule either. It should be served in a copper cup and it was given in a regular glass ...."}
{"text":"In town for spring training and decided to try this place out. We took our food to go because we had to get back to the hotel.  Things that were good:  Customer Service - the bartender that took our order was very helpful in answering the questions we had about menu items.   Things that were bad:  The wings - they were very typical wings. The wings themselves were ok. There was very little seasoning on them. We got an order of buffalo ranch boneless. The ranch flavor that I could taste was from the ranch dressing I dipped them in. The order of chili pepper hot was hot whenever I ate a piece that actually had sauce on it. The order of ancho chili lime were the same as the buffalo ranch.   The name - I don't get it. I haven't looked in to their story, but they had a Cubs, Cardinals, Bears, Packers, and Yankee sign on the wall. There was a picture of NYC on the wall to and we think there's a New York connection to the name.   Overall I would have rather gone to the national wing chain restaurant even though I really hate that place."}
{"text":"Bad service, order wrong and had to argue with waitress about it,  Did not receive an itemized bill. Wil never go here again."}
{"text":"I love going here with friends! It's always a good time! food is awesome! The real reason I come back is cause the service! Ashlee Breeanne bowling is great! Always fast and very helpful she's the reason I always go back thank you and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We had the best service we've had in a really long time! The food was really good and came out just like we ordered it. If you go ask for Preston. He was our server and I'm sure he had a lot to do with our awesome experience! Considering the amount we eat out and the standard of service we are used to, this definitely exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Came for karaoke. Great show with an excellent host. Clean bar area with great staff. Felt welcome and open minded singers of all levels. Highly recommend the Saturday karaoke show and the wings! Lots of TV's!"}
{"text":"Last night was kind of an exception... the wings were really greasy and the service was less than great.  Normally their salt and pepper wings are tough to beat!  If you go, try Tuesdays / Thursdays as the wings are much cheaper.  It wasn't just the wings - the Dos XX keg that was on \"special\" was flat - and they even forgot to take them off the tab when we left.  In other words, don't hurry to get here, but if you do show up, come for happy hour on Tues / Thurs."}
{"text":"I LOVE Native New Yorker but this location just outshines all others. Workers are very attentive and helpful. Very little waiting, if any. Food is so yummy. Even though it's the same menu as all other stores, no one does the Honey Hot wings like this location. Always great service."}
{"text":"Great place for Lunch in Tempe!  The service is usually above par and the patio is nice to dine on.  Wings are probably some of the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"The wings are great, just start off by saying that, and if you go on the right night they are cheap too! However if you plan on going and having good service if you in a group of more than 4 good luck. They are slow and they forget about you especially if you dine outside. The waitress dropped our food on the ground as she was coming out, no big deal accidents happen. We had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food after already waiting for 45 minutes. We didnt throw a fit or complain, then we get our bill and we got charged full price for everything, not even a \"Hey sorry bout that accident and you having to wait over an hour to eat so here is a little discount\". Nothing. I have eaten here before and knew what to expect but I figured after screwing up like that they would at least do something. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My server was Caitlyn.  She was amazing and very accommodating to me and my service dog.  Very polite and easy going.  Always checked to see if I needed anything.  The wings are cooked to order.  And I drive over 45  minutes just to dine at this NNY."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at this location! Native Grill is an awesome place for Happy hour and for wings! The managers and employees seem to enjoy their jobs,  which translates into great service!"}
{"text":"Wings were good. Service was ok. SO MANY FLIES. crawling all over our food and us. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The service here is awful.  The first time we came here it took them 5-10 minutes to even greet us.  The bar was empty, so it's not like they were busy (we could see them standing around).  We waited an eternity to even get a good order in,, then once we did get it in and received our meal it took even longer to get our check and pay.    Tried it again tonight and we waited five minutes in the bar side again and were never greeted.  The restaurant and bar were not packed, the bar tender (one of three) stared and made direct eye contact with us and still no greeting from anyone.  We never got to order any drinks.  We'll never come back to this Native again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. Had an order to go and parked at the curb side pick up walked in and was tolled to go to the other side of the restaurant at the bar to pick it up. I am still waiting  after 20 mins on"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst native. Worst service. They take forever to get your drinks and even longer to take your order. Once ur food has been served they do not bother to check up on you, no refills on your drinks unless you are lucky enough to find your server. It's not just one particular server, it's everyone and this happens every single time I go too this location. I love Native Grill & Wings but not this one."}
{"text":"So here's a the deal.. Wings are always good, drinks are always strong but the service is like a box of chocolates ... \"You never know what your gonna get\" in my Forest Gump  voices.   The bartenders are always on point, I've never left Native feeling like I was cheated, but the service can be sooooo good and then the next time you go it Is sooooo bad that it's literally like a surprise at every visit.   Final Say: Overall nice local spot to watch the game..."}
{"text":"One of the best as far as service n food.  We sat by a table that complained about EVERYTHING n once they got their bill covered they did the whole high 5 n goodness those wings were good just not hot enough"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars when it was Native New Yorker. We were back after a couple of years and the service leaves a lot to be desired. We had to wait over an hour for our wings only to receive an incorrect order. They offered to fix it but we weren't willing to wait another hour so we ate what they brought to us. Then, of the 3 flavors brought, 2 were cold and only one was at the right temperature.  Later on someone stopped by to ask how everything was going and I told her how bad it had been so far. She offered to give us dessert but we weren't hungry nor in the mood to stay for dessert so we declined, paid our full tab and left to never come back. We'll find another wing place."}
{"text":"We come here often (used to go to the one on Signal Butte also). Today stopped for lunch. Long wait for food. Stephanie, our server was great! However, short staffed and took a very long time for food to come out. My girlfriend had a club and I had a Callifornia Cluck. Neither had any mayo or condiments on them. Then we discovered the bacon on both was limp and appeared raw. The manager came over and told me I was wrong, bacon came in precooked. I spent many years working in restaurants and this stuff was raw. He apologized and offered to re-cook both. Said he was 2 cooks short, well I don't approve of excuses. I asked that he go ahead and redo them, the new sandwiches were very good. However, nothing further was done. A decent manager would have comped the food or gave a discount.   I try to write about good things when out, but I don't like being told to my face I'm lying, nor being given excuses for shoddy food or work. Giving raw food, especially pork, is very dangerous. I'm debating how far to go with this. Maybe report to the County Health Department.   Again, Stephanie is a jewel there, but their manager needs to learn when food is servable."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed! I placed an order online, it was past my pickup time when they were done, and I got home and opened up the container to find black boneless chicken wings that were lacking in sauce, even though I had ordered them saucy. I had never been to this location before, and I never will again!!!  I gave it 2 stars purely for the fact that the bartender, who had just come on, was really nice!"}
{"text":"Dear nothin'-native about New York. You suck. Your pizza is gross and never thoroughly cooked (ie: the crust is doughy and thin), your chicken\" strippers\" are the size of a baby's thumb...(true story, I totally compared on a 6month old.) Oh.... and did I mention the servers have a terrible attitude, and everything and anything is over-priced. I ordered fried zucchini once (for 6 dollars) and I received 6 nickel-sized soggy things. Really? I could have gone to Carl's Jr's 4 times and been more satisfied, and I don't even like fast-food. Heed my warnings; this place is a total waste. The only thing that is vaugly redeeming is the trivia game system, however; Buffalo Wild Wings has the same thing and you wont feel robbed after leaving."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my son for some lunch and ordered the boneless wings because I knew they'd be easier for him to eat. Our server was friendly and accomodating. I ordered a half pound of half spicy honey mustard and half honey BBQ, both ended up tasting pretty good, aside from the spicy honey mustard being a little skimpy on the sauce. Native changed up their menu since my last visit, with order-by-pound rather than by actual number. Not sure how I feel about that.  Management was kind enough to offer me a giftcard after my last less-than-okay visit, which is a nice gesture and I must commend them for that. This visit was a big improvement from the previous."}
{"text":"Has a great Dinner with our !! Thank you Alexis for making our dinner great!! We will definitely be back!! We lived our super crispy . Yummy yummy yum!!! Be sure and ask to be seated in Alexis' area you'll always be treated right!! She's a blast!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice now. The first time we had the dozen wing special and the 22 oz beer special. The wings came out steaming hot and delish. The beer came out in a frosted mug and was great. Our only complaint would be that we only got one big piece of chicken wing, the rest were the smaller wing sections.  The second visit we had the 14\" house thin crust pizza and 22 oz beer special. The pizza was outstanding but this time the beers came out in cold mugs (not frosted) so they didn't stay cold very long. Overall, this is our NEW sports bar and we can't wait to try everything on the menu, It all looks great and also the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"If you could give negative stars I would have given them a -10! Sat immediately upon arrival and waited for 15 minutes with our menus closed ready to order. The waiter went to the table seated 5 minutes after us and took their order and ignored us. When I said something the host said sorry about that. Figure it out Native Grill & Wings you just lost a 3 person dinner and drinks ticket on a Saturday night and several customers listening to my story in your lobby! Heading to Buffalo Wild Wings now!"}
{"text":"Horrible just horrible. This is for a to go order. First off, the wings we ordered were all too salty. It really tasted like it was thrown in a bucket of salt! I was so disappointed. We had ordered extra sauce and veggies and ranch and did not have any of it. When we called in to let them know, the first person to answer was so rude! We were trying to explain what had happened and he cut us off and said do you want to speak to someone. And then just transferred our call. Disgusting! To top that off the manager didnt quite seem all that caring about our bad experience. Will never go here again if they dont change the attitude!"}
{"text":"We usually order wings and loaded fries and they are delicious. The service is good and pretty fast. My only complain is i wish the restrooms were cleaner but besides that native is our go to wing spot."}
{"text":"Service and management has gotten a lot better! Better service, larger wings! Better wait staff!  59 cent wings on Tuesday will disrupt my taco Tuesday for sure!  Extra ranch and celery was a nice touch! Friendly and competent waitress!!! Nice manager!"}
{"text":"I have visited many times since my last review and I am glad to move my rating up to 4 stars now. I just love their chicken strippers and all the varieties of wet and dry rubs they offer (Thurs they are on special). Obviously, the honey hot is where it is at for me, but the buffalo ranch is also pretty good. Last visit, I tried the hangover burger and it was just insane (in the good way). With avocado, a full hash brown, and an egg, how could you go wrong? All in all, I love Native for all the television viewing options and the food is good. I still think portions at times can still be off. For example, a friend of mine always orders their pizza cookie with ice cream for dessert given she loves it for what it is. Sadly though, it looks like there is so little cookie in the dish. I think they would be far better off raising the price point a little and giving more dough. Just my two cents. All in all though, I do enjoy Native."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for the last two years. The portions have nearly been cut in half and the quality has been on a downhill slide.   The orders have become so small that I actually laughed out loud when I opened mine.   It will be my last meal from Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"In the bar to grab a drink and some wings. Place is filthy, tables are greasy and window shades are spattered with sauce gunk. The drink menu holders have a gross film on them , went to wash my hands after shuffling through the filthy drink menu. Bench seats have rips in them ... Not appealing at all."}
{"text":"Oh Native.   I want this restaurant to be good but we have had countless bad experiences here so we just can't waste our time or money anymore. It's so close to my house and the atmosphere is good for dinner but that's about it.   I like to get appetizers before the meal. Every time without fail, it takes 20 minutes to get the appetizers and then the food comes out two minutes later. So, do I want to eat my dinner hot or the appetizers? What do I let get cold?   We've brought this to the attention of the managers every time and they usually take the apps off the check. Great for some people but I'd rather just have a normal dining experience.   The service really isn't great either. The people Working there are nice but I'm not there to make friends.   Regardless of everything we have given this place so many chances since I moved to Laveen in August, we won't be eating here again. It makes me sad but it really ain't worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here about five times, and while I'm still not a fan, I'm leaning in that direction.  The wings are great.  It's all the other food that I'm not crazy about.  But those wings!  There are plenty of sauces to choose from, and with different levels of heat.  My son loved the honey barbeque.  I tried the honey chipotle, which definitely had a kick.    As others have said the service is hit or miss.  Celery and dip is supposed to come with wing orders, but sometimes the server remembers and sometimes you have to ask.  The stuffed potato skin appetizer is good, but the dinner salad has only three ingredients and one of those is, of course, lettuce.   What adds to the fun of this place is that most evenings there's a good crowd watching games on numerous TV screens and just having a good time."}
{"text":"Amber is the best! Always does a great job. Friendly and great service! Besides her being a Cowboys fan, she is a awesome! Her manager Kari is pretty cool also! Way better than Applebees or Cogburns! My Cheers!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever very racist I joke kicked out over playing bout a free drink when I tip more than what my tabs are never spending money again in this roach place most of the staff is rude"}
{"text":"Definitely a poor excuse for a wing place. The pizzas are thin, sad attempts at a NY style floppy pies... They are thin with no body, the cheese was lacking.  The wings were returned once because they were stone cold, came back hot in the middle and cold on the outside still. They wouldn't dare microwave wings would they?  Hands down, this place would be a waste of time and money. The experience was poor for being a two-top at 2 pm..."}
{"text":"EDIT: The last 3 times I have visited the Broadway location they have screwed up my order.  I had to wait 52 minutes from the time we walked in the door to the time they finally got my food to me properly cooked.  The last time I also had to send the food back twice, and around 5 tables had already eaten and left before my order came.  They took the orders of around 4 tables before us, despite the fact that we had been seated and waiting for a long period of time.  And no, I am not exaggerating, their service really is that poor.  A few Native locations have also shut down recently in Phoenix, so I am limited with my other options as far as where to get wings.  I absolutely hate the service at the Broadway location so I will never return to that one, but I have driven out to the Awatukee location and their wings have been excellent along with their service.  If Native wings were not the best in the valley, I would quite honestly never eat there.  The service is horrendous, the menu pretty much sucks otherwise, and it is hard to admit because I've eaten there for close to 25 years.  My girlfriend hates it, so I've been going to ATL Wings more often because their wings are bigger and they also use a Frank's Hot Sauce blend like Natives does for the sauce.  ATL is slow, but their wings are always perfect.  I'll probably still hit up the Native location in Awatukee a couple times a year, but that's it.  It's sad to see them fall so far from grace, especially over the past few years.  Old Review: This place has quite literally the best hot wings ever created on the face of the earth by man.  It is my all-time favorite food and place to eat.  I began eating hot wings at Natives in the 7th grade way back in the day when Tuesday wings were 15 cents.  I've been eating at that same location for a very very long time, even before the renovations and name change and before the condos were built next door.  It is my favorite place ever.  Over the years they have messed up my orders, but they always fix it when I send the food back.  I am very particular with my wings.  It is the hands down the best wing place EVA!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for wings around 2pm. Place was pretty busy but that was expected as the World Cup was on. I knew this would be a bad experience as there was no one at the front counter and several tables were still covered in dishes. Waited at the unattended hostess station for about 5 minutes before we were greeted.  Waited another 5-10 minutes for the server to come to our table. Wings came out relatively quickly, probably because they were sitting under a heat lamp. They were not hot, but slightly warm. Waitress took our plates plates when we were done eating (yay!) but didn't return for another 5+ minutes. We were clearly done, should have brought us our check. After being given the check, she disappeared for another 5-10 minutes before taking the payment. 5 minutes later she returned with our change (lots of 5 min+ waits). I get that it was busy but have more than 3 people on staff for a day that will probably be pretty busy. Oh and several toilets were out of order and trash cans were overflowing."}
{"text":"It good. So it gets a passing grade.   Wings are done well and are large. Lots of good flavors for a group who might not agree. They also don't care if u get 100 of the same flavor of 20 wings all different. Unlike BWW.   I really like the pork queso and the fact they serve tater tots.   It's a good spot for a game night and with food and booze."}
{"text":"Empty at lunch time was first indicator. Grilled chicken was under cooked. 2nd try was just done but was a over cooked taste less waste of time and effort. Sun blinds filthy and looked more like a grease stained sample of patrons back flow. Not just this location. Same deal at the location on gilbert and germann. Philly steak now the steak-ums garbage meat like garbage. Do not waste your time or money here. Had similar experience a year ago."}
{"text":"This establishment has come up. Great service and great managers above all. They comped my dinner tonight for a simple order mistake. They didn't have to. But I really did appreciate the level of care they showed me and my family. Thank you and we will definitely continue to be patrons of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The service wasn't great because of a lot of mixups. Our waitress tried very hard though. Three different waitresses brought out our appetizer, entree, and dessert. A  different one came to us with an artichoke dip that we didn't order; later, she walked around with our dessert, looking for the right table to deliver it and walked right past us. We received the wrong bill. The waitress didn't put our dessert on the bill, then added it and charged for it afterwards. I ended up with three different receipts. My boyfriend said the wings are not as good as they used to be; too much breading. I had a chicken apple walnut salad which was decent, but not for over $12. The dessert cookie was really good; no complaints on that. Oh, and there was a fruit fly in my water at the very beginning. I didn't say anything because I figured that was the worst of it, but the rest of the night wasn't redeeming.  I really like supporting local companies and brands, but next time I'm going to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Service is good, for restaurants in Buckeye food is better than normal."}
{"text":"NO LONGER A PLACE FOR ME  I've been a lifelong visitor to Native New Yorker (now Native) over the past 2 decades with this location being my most visited. Each and every time I ordered the wings as I fell in love with them the very first time. Literally the only other thing I've had is a side salad (and a cold beer of course) during my hundreds of visits but sad to say this place has lost me...  1) Price: Nearly $14 when you factor in tax for a dozen wings is ridiculous. I can get a cheap steak at some placed for that.  2) Quality & Flavor: not sure when they changed wing suppliers but these wings don't even resemble the taste of chicken, more like a bunch of gristle packed onto a bone. I wouldn't feed my dog this stuff, my stomach is iron clad and it was reminding me shortly after we left that I shouldn't have put such crappy (not even mediocre) wings in my belly and had gas all night and I can eat anything.   3) Ambience: the layout of the dining area is still the same, two side-by-side dinning areas. However they removed all of the TV's that ran down the middle separating both areas. For our group that was in a booth against the far wall 2 people had to sit on the edge of the seat cushion to watch the game on the wall next to the booth 2 doors down which quickly led to my neck hurting. Everyone else at the table couldn't watch the game as the only one in sight was clear across on the other far wall that backs up to the bar area in the other dining area and it was so far away you couldn't really see anything and watching people in the other area eat their food or stare at their head was a bit awkward.  It was good while it lasted, but somebody appears to have made changes forgetting about the quality of the product being served or the quality of the experience for the paying customers."}
{"text":"The wings are the best of all I've had. Gets rather noisy when kids are, but there is also a bar area where they don't usually go. All in all I like the place. Menu keeps improving."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and it's typically a stop for us when we visit Phoenix, but it's really gone downhill in the last few years. The service was pretty poor, there was an obvious lack of management, and the quality of food was below average."}
{"text":"Husband's chicken sandwich was ok.  I ordered a salad described on menu as mixed greens.  It was  iceburg with a couple small pieces of romaine.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Slow service, but they're busy so maybe just understaffed. My Native Sliders were more akin to McDonald's cheeseburgers in that they were small, fry and tasteless and had very little cheese. Not really impressed with the place but I reckon people come for the wings and beer!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the food is pretty awesome. The only complaint I have is that a lot of the food is incredibly salty. The loaded buffalo chip appetizer in particular is loaded alright... With about a pound of salt!! Otherwise I enjoy this place very much :)"}
{"text":"Stephanie has it together man! Great server in the bar! Smile , service and personality plus!  Why can't all servers be that awesome? Just came up with a menu item that is to die for! Loaded fries with smoked pulled pork! OMG! Awesome flavor! Game day fav for sure! My husband went nuts over them!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to this Native before, and came for lunch on Saturday. Meghan was our server and bartender, and was so friendly and upbeat. She immediately brought over a high chair for our daughter and asked if she could get something out real quick for the little one. (Pretty awesome.) Meghan also recommended the Honey Hot wings, slightly crispy, and they were awesome. She made a fabulous Bloody Mary, as well.  Great food and fantastic service. Thanks, Meghan! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came in and got taken care of by Scott the General Manager.  Games on every screen cold beer and great food.  Can't beat that !! Plus $0.59 cent wings.  Delicious Deal!!"}
{"text":"Go here about once a month with friends.  While it has never been one of my top choices, there are a few menu items I enjoy.  This evening, I ordered one of them, a meatball sub.  When it came out the sub roll was tiny.  It was as though they served it on half a roll.  I pointed it out to the waitress and she agreed and took it back to be remade.  In less than a minute, the manager brought the original sandwich back and explained that rather than cut the roll from the side, they now split it from the top.  The only problem is that the \"new\" roll is so small that it is physically impossible to pick it up and eat it as a sub sandwich and can only be eaten with a knife and fork as an open face sandwich.  The meatballs and sauce were still good, but this was not what was previously served and as was stiill described on the menu.  The most annoying was when the manager, Pete, brought the sandwich back, he didn't ask if I would like to order anything else or apologize for the unadvertised change, but just set it down in front of me with a \"deal with it\" attitude.  After we paid the bill, he stopped by to ask how everything was and I expressed my dissatisfaction with what was a poorly executed cost cutting measure.  He said thanks and would pass it on to corporate as they liked to hear \"honest\" feedback.   Bottom line: corporate chain that is losing touch with customer satisfaction and a manager who doesn't have a clue regarding customer service."}
{"text":"So never been to this location before, Sat at a table and had to get up from the table to be acknowledged? 5 people at the bar who where the most friendly people ever, had to ask for another drink? Then had to beg for a check. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Sign on the door says they're open until 1:30 AM. Just tried to get a drink and play trivia, and was told they already did last call (it's 12:15 AM). Waiter suggested we go to Zipps down the road, so that's where we are headed. So stupid!"}
{"text":"Good wings (as long as they don't over salt them as that happened to me the first time I visited)  Good fries, cold beer and foot ball on every screen = a very content woman and a guy who is calm! The woman's bathroom however leaves something to be desired however I really had to go. It was disgusting to say the least. However the waitstaff gets a 5 stars and everything else is about 2.5 ish."}
{"text":"I have given this place several tries, and I shall not being going back any more.  The service inside is soooooooo slow.  Last time we ordered wings from them there were still feathers on several of the pieces (I'm still shocked by that, how does that happen??).  In spite of the fact that they know the service is bad, there is never an apology or discount given, just excuses.  No thanks!! I've taken my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have returned to this location several times since my last review and I have noticed a huge improvement. Staff has been friendly and the wings have been amazing. I truly enjoy this Native location and will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"Food was okay, had some okay beer specials and bartender was okay.  Middle of the road kinda place.  Not crowded at all.  Good place to go and watch a game.  Nothing to write home about but I've definitely had worse..."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. When my friend and I first arrived, the hostess tried to seat us outside RIGHT between two large and very loud ten tops, when the entire other side of the patio was open tables... When we asked to sit to at the other table, I jokingly asked if our new server was terrible. Bad move on my part because then the hostess openly and unprofessionally shared all her negative opions about our new waitress jazlynn.  Unfortunately she lived up to her reputation and was rude,  inattentive, and seemed annoyed at simple requests like refills of empty glasses.  Beer was warm. Food was slow. Service was terrible.  Sure it was a Thursday night, and it was busy, but come on! really disappointing."}
{"text":"Was excited that they were back, but disappointed with the food and service. Cold wings, forgot to put on toppings that belonged to the dish and then charged as if they were extra requested. Took longer to get the check than it was to wait for the food and consume combined. Will wait awhile before going back to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"i had the absolute worst experience of my life ever!!!! one: my waitress at 60 years old was so doped up on drugs she forgot to take my order after giving us our drinks, 37 minutes i waited. i have a 2 year old. finally when he got his food he was done before she came back to take my order. then then!!! he gets up to run to the games, again he's two. he's laughing and running to them with the money i give him and two tables of old people dykes are complaining i need to teach him manners. im like hes laughing wtf do you want me to do tell him to stop? you cant control another human being and im not going to hit my child because you think i should for laughing. the manager says i need to go. im like for what??? coming to a family establishment??? what is wrong with people!???? a two year old doesnt listen when he's enjoying himself, he's laughing not screaming and throwing stuff."}
{"text":"Shut it down.  Abysmal location, abysmal service.  Buffalo wings should never be served cold.  Actually calling them chicken wings is a misnomer - these are sparrow-sized wings at best.    And the menu revamp dumped the most Western New York sandwich of them all - the Beef on Weck."}
{"text":"The food is just ok but Misti the waitress is wonderful!  She goes above and beyond to make you happy.  If you go we recommend asking for her specifically, you won't be disappointed.  She makes sure you get your food really fast even when the place is really busy.  She kept our drinks full and even entertained our children.  If service could make or break a restaurant Misti definitely makes it."}
{"text":"While I have not eaten at this particular NNY( I moved here from NY and is not that \"native\"...at all) it's 2 min away from where I live.Food is meh at the other ones though.  I just saw Devon review and I'm appalled and disgusted. If in fact it's  true, I will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone I know to do the same as well. It is one thing to have different believes and a whole other to display such hatred and bigotry.  I appreciate this type of reviews, that way I can avoid places like this."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner with a coworker and we were AMAZED with the staff at this location!!! (Gilbert & Germann) Karina, our server, was fast, friendly and consistently had on a beautiful smile the whole time she helped us!  Our drinks were topped off the whole time, and our food was out almost as fast as we ordered it!  The manager in duty that evening Cheryl- (forgive my spelling of the name if I butchered it!), came by to check on us as well.. I have never had such a pleasant experience in a \"neighborhood eatery\".. definitely going back there because of the exceptional service we received... you guys rock! :)"}
{"text":"The food was standard native flavors but colder then I remembered. Sadly, the cold food was the best part of our dining experience. Service was so slow and terrible. When we could not find our server I had to beg other to help, to which I got nothing but attitude. I ask for a manager when I have my server my card and Bill. Before the manager came, he made it a point to run my credit card. He knew his restaurant is subpar. Never, never going back. I might not go back to any native as a matter of fact."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and really wanted to like it because of convenience of location.  But unfortunately, I gotta say, buffalo wild wings is much better. First, the wings...we tried the salt and vinegar, the jalapeño, the asiago cheese dry rub, and the honey hot.  It's pretty bad when you couldn't even tell which one is salt and vinegar and which one is jalapeno.  My guess is the jalapeño is the one with the green sauce, but it tasted so vinegary that everyone else thought it was the vinegar.  The asiago was not bad, nice and crunchy, but that's it.  The honey hot was basically sweet BBQ sauce, and the other one just tasted like fried chicken wings. The service...quite slow...we got our second ordered entree first (salad), long before we got our appetizer.  And they served us wings with no napkins and no plate or container for the bones.  The server even noted they forgot to give us napkins when he brought over the wings, but he never came back with them. Over all, I would choose buffalo wild wings easily over this.  But its good enough if I don't want to go too far I guess."}
{"text":"I came here about 2 weeks after opening and the entire experience was bad, but we decided to try it again, and it was actually worse... Horrible service!! From the I don't care attitude of the hostess to the I don't wanna be here of the server all the way up to the \"manager\".. The food was typical of all other Native Grill and Wings in town. There is nothing special here to make me ever come back or refer ANYONE here. I truly wish I knew how there are any positive comments about this place.."}
{"text":"Before they changed the name I had came here with my family and to be honest we all thought the food here was terrible (this was a few years back when they were still serving pasta) Now since the name and I believe a menu change I can't get enough of this place. everything is delicious and the wings are Amazing! if I want good wings I go here!!!"}
{"text":"In the past we had gotten good food and the place was nice. I had not been there in about a year and was appalled tonight. I asked to sit in the patio about 6:30 this evening and it had still not been cleaned from the night before. Broken glass, tables not cleared, cigarette butts everywhere. Cockroaches crawling around even. I ordered a Stella tap and it was stale or something, I had to get one in a bottle. Then I get dinner and it wan not even edible. The lettuce was expired, the chicken was gross. Nothing like what it looked like on the menu. A lady at the bar said she had ordered the same thing and it was just as bad. I was so disappointed!! The waitress explained that the owner was having a Christmas party and they were all temp staff from other locations. That was no excuse."}
{"text":"first off let me start by saying that from the second i walked in i encounter a belligerent drunk man  that was yelling at 3 of the employees . Instead of asking the man to leave they allow him to yell and scream at  them while the cops came. Second when you have wings in the name of the establishment i would assume that that's something they would specialize or take pride in. Since the people in the front where dealing with the drunk guy i decide to sit at the bar.it took about ten minutes to order my drink , understandable if they where busy buy it wasn't many a quarter full. So then me and my wife decide to get some wings to share. When we got the wings they where cold like as if they where pre made sitting. I wanted to try those place because someone i know compared it to buffalo wild wings. So im just going to stick with wild wings because they ay least make to order."}
{"text":"The place had a foul smell coming from the kitchen. (really bad), The waitress was great, but I couldn't get past the stench. The same chain on power rd is a much better choice"}
{"text":"This is the first pizza place I went to the day we moved into town.  It was decent.  Their wings are great!  The garlic bread with cheese is huge and delicious.  Drink are just fine.  Overall, seems like a solid place to go watch a game or have a beer and pizza.. or wings!"}
{"text":"Nice setup... But I sat waiting for 20 minutes and nobody helped me or even approached me to take an order. So... I can't really comment on the food or drinks, but the service gets no stars.  This was my first and last time I'll come in."}
{"text":"#OMG. They call this chicken???!???? What part of the chicken did this come from? I can't tell. You won't tell either.  We ordered a sampler and to our surprise, one item was worse from the next.  The chicken was so terrible in texture and taste. We are in a restaurant, couldn't they make any of this food fresh? Everything is just heat and eat garbage. Not fair. The place is a mess. They seems to have some employees but no one is working. Bad service. We have to keep getting up from our table and ask for someone to get us anything and everything. The floor is a mess. When will they sweep? Do they ever sweep? This has been a terrible experience. We should have read the bad reviews and gone somewhere else. We won't be back and if you are smart you will read all these bad reviews and eat somewhere else. There has to be a good reason why there are so many bad reviews. If Yelp is anything, it should warn you about places like this."}
{"text":"Place was empty.  Party of 2.  I asked for \"1/2 Hoagies Philly Steak (Lunch Only) $5.99  Served with famous homemade potato chips. \" from online menu.  I was told they did not serve the sandwiches in 1/2.  My son ordered a calzone and drink.  Calzone had only 3 pieces of pepperoni. Waitress never asked about refills. She helped other table that was sat after us. After waiting 10 minutes after food was done, we gave up and went to the bar for ticket.  She came out the back side, then made a face when I asked for ticket.  She proceeded to stand there staring at my son's wallet while he got the money out. RUDE! Total was $13!   Never again!!!!  This place gives Native a bad name."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3 and a half stars because that's what this place should get, the waitress was nice but my beer and the food took a while to get to our table. (Over 35 minutes) and they were not very busy. Once we got the food it was fantastic!! We got a appetizer combo with Onion Rings, Chicken Fingers, cheese sticks and more, even saved room for cheesecake for dessert. I will probably come back but hope the kitchen gets faster."}
{"text":"We ate here twice in the past week while we were in Phoenix (same location).  The wings are great (get the crispy version (bone-in) with whatever flavor.  Pizza and salads are also very good.  Enough about the food.  The first night we met some friends and were about a half hour late so they had already ordered so we dismissed the poor service.  We didn't have silverware and when my wife asked, the waiter asked if a plastic fork was ok.  She had a salad and wings.  I looked up and asked U Wot M8?  \"Are you serious?\"  He just stared at me and said he would go get one but they were dirty.  I said we don't want a dirty fork and he just left. He came back with not one, but three sets of perfectly good silverware wrapped in napkins and they were clean. Needless to say, the waiter was dreadful and I had a hard time tipping him anything but I mustered a small one.  The second night we came back and the place was dead, maybe at 20% capacity but the lounge seemed busy (on the other side).  We even prefaced our meal and told our waitress about the horrible service the night before thinking she would get the hint.  She didn't.  Our food took forever, even if the bar was crowded.  She was not attentive to our drinks and, again, I had a hard time justifying a tip.  Bottom-line:  Go for the food because it IS good but don't expect anything beyond that.  They must train the staff to give horrible service on purpose.  I don't know how else to justify what we experience on two different nights with a small crowd."}
{"text":"I love coming into Native to unwind and relax... I love the wings, and the service. Amber the bartender always goes the extra mile to make it a fun and comfortable experience. Great staff, great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am very sad to have to write this. Last night, my family and I went to the Native Grill and Wings in Surprise to celebrate National Chicken Wing Day. I had been looking forward to this day all week. The food was great, but the service sucked. It took 20 minutes for us just to get drinks. We we there for over two hours and the only reason we didn't leave is because all 4 of us were starving. I guess our original server was too slow so the bartender had to wait on our table. He was also busy behind the bar, but nobody checked in on us while he was busy.  We spent upwards of 75 dollars, and I can say I will only be back when my father visits because your wings are his favorite, but I will now visit other establishments that have way better service. We did get our dessert for free, but thought that was quite lackluster. I could understand if the place was jumping, but it was not busy at all. I feel bad that the bartender was left to fend for himself!"}
{"text":"I am a regular. I love this place. But today- I am highly disappointed. I was given 2 beers in 2 hours by kalena, not because I wasn't drinking slow- because that's how long it took. My sister waited waaaay longer than myself for a drink and was agitated with me. I ordered food that didn't come out until I asked Karlie for help. The food I ordered was not done right and I was overcharged. I actually paid for wings with no sauce and bad service. This is not normal, but it's not acceptable. Disappointed tonight.    Again- I paid my tab in full for bad food that I returned."}
{"text":"Overall This place is pretty good  What I like: -Tuesday and Thursday: $0.49 wing days -Great happy hour everyday -Good bar area  What I don't like: -waiter/waitress service: just slow service even when its dead in there. -boneless wings: normall I get these else where but here they cook them too dry  Since there isn't much else out in the Ahwatukee Foothills this is probably my favorite place to grab something quick to eat especially if I am in the mood for wings.  However I wish they would hire some better servers.  I've had to go up to the bar on multiple visits to order another drink or place a drink order because the waitress is no where to be found."}
{"text":"Me and my family decided to go to native around 8 and didn't have a good experience. I ordered the Wednesday night boneless wing special and when they came out they looked dry and had hardly any sauce. The wings looked like they were sitting for an hour before they came out to us. They tasted old and were cold. I told the waiter I wanted a fresh batch and she said no problem. She came back like 20 min later and these wings...I kid you not... were the same exact wings just probably dumped back in the fryer and they added new sauce on top of the old dried sauce and tasted so bad. They were hard and really salty. I was not satisfied at all, I couldn't even eat them. Nobody ate them at the table. I don't think I'll be coming back. The wings were horrible. I used to be in the restaurant business and I know what fresh food looks like and taste like. I was not happy with this experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Our group arrived late around 11:15pm with a baby in tow. Loud karaoke was happening, smokers were outside, and, due to a slow night, half the space was closed down. They generously did place our group in the back room.   Our group had an assortment of burgers, while I had the chicken stripper plate with ancho chile lime rub. The meal was just ok, being standard bar fare. They win on service, but are only ok in the food department."}
{"text":"We ate here once and the food was terrible but the service was passible. Fast Forward a year or so and my husband took my daughter and I here one night because they were looking for a sports pub-like atmosphere for wings and pizza. After nearly an hour of waiting for ANY of their food order to show, my husband called me from the place and asked if I thought they should leave. I told them to yes, walk out after letting the server know. He said it was not crowded at all and they just left. Upon telling the server why they were leaving, the server told him this is just how long it took there. No offer to comp dinner, no telling him it would be just a moment longer, nothing. Just gave up on the spot. We will never eat there again. Not worth it. I have no idea how they stay in business."}
{"text":"The first time I went here they totally spaced my order - something about a broken printer.  Good news is they gave me free meal coupons (had to come back - no instant comp).  The bad news was that I went back.  Me and my buddy both ordered beef dishes and we were both praying to the porcelain god that night.  I didn't give it one star because I actually liked the place the first time I went."}
{"text":"Love this place. I make it there on Fridays for happy hour and the bar area is almost full by 5pm. Always something great to watch on their many TV's. Food is outstanding, for as long as I can remember I have not had a bad plate of anything. Wings are superb, nachos are best around! Friendly staff and the new management that is out on the floor greeting customers and checking on things. Highly recommended if in the area."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Sports Bar for around 3 years.  It's always a busy, happy place.  They're wings are excellent.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  During football season, I go get take out almost every week."}
{"text":"Once Native Newyorker, now Native. Once had delicious juicy wings, now the worst wings I've ever had. Having once worked for this company, I remember the food being so good. Tonight was an extreme disappointment! Most of my wings were so tiny, like they came from a new born chick. They were tasteless, even with the flavors I choose. The price of the food was a little high. They now charge 89 cents per wing if you don't get their \"pack\" deal. I was not impressed at all and do not plan on returning. Ever since the company got bought out the quality of their food has fell short of any sane person's standards.    On a brighter note, the waiter (Nate) was very pleasant. He was attentive and kind. Only gave two stars because of his customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a second time and I must say I was not impressed. The restaurant is very clean and appealing to the eye but food is serious lacking. Last time I ordered the wings and absolutely loved them despite the length of time it took to finally get them. This time I decided to try something different so I ordered the BBQ pork sliders. Big mistake. There was not much pork inside and there was absolutely zero flavor to it. The food once again took quite some time and was luke warm. Shortly after eating  there I did not feel well and developed a bad stomach ache followed by a trip to the bathroom. Not sure if it was the sauce or if the pork was under cooked but, either way I won't be visiting this location for a long time if at all."}
{"text":"I like Native in general, and had never been to this location before.  It's huge, but even during the lunch rush service was prompt and the food was out quickly.  Food quality was similar to all their other locations, very good.  Love the \"suicide\" wings here."}
{"text":"Never been here before so we checked it out on a weeknight. Not too busy, got a table in bar area. Server was nice and attentive. Wings were not good. If you want good wings in buckeye, go to Bootys."}
{"text":"Our server was nice, but the restaurant was not very tidy, and service was slow.  The food was mediocre.  Would not go out of my way to eat here.  Was looking for a bite to eat before movies."}
{"text":"Wednesday a group of us attended lunch at this establishment. We arrived at 11am and there were only 2 occupied tables in the dinning area. Our server was attentive and prompt once we were seated. She took our beverage orders within minutes of seating. When we received our drinks she took our food orders, this was roughly 11:15. Once 11:40 rolled around we started to notice tables that came in after us were already eating, no big deal, plenty of TV's showing some old UFC fights. By 11:50 I was curious as to why our food was not out, or at minimal an explanation.  We finally received some of our food orders at 12:00. I fully understand this is a sit-down establishment and not fast food, but 45 minutes for some salads and a couple wings? A few of us had to take the food in a to-go container as we had already spent our lunch hour waiting. On the bright side, there was plenty of parking, and we saw some guy get kicked in the apple sack during the UFC fight. Won't be coming back to this place. And to think, I thought Buffalo Wild Wings was bad."}
{"text":"We like to sit at the bar and eat most of the time. Last night we where at the bar and there was a loud mouth guy next to my wife. I asked him to hold it down and he came unglued. The bar tender and the manager did not handle the situation well at all. AMATURES. We will still go there but maybe sit at a table since the STAFF over serve patrons at the bar and when they become loud and obnoxious the bar tenders and the manager act like they did not know what was going on......how convenient."}
{"text":"I really like the Natives, the one in Show Low is my home bar. I've been in half a dozen or so, and found them to be great sports bars with big screens and great wings.   This one stands out. Great facility, great food, great service, and great beer. A great place.   Seriously, this place does it all right."}
{"text":"THEY COULD CARE LESS!!! Decided to try them for lunch.  We arrived at their front door at 1105am.  Doors were locked.  Sign said they opened at 11am.  We rattled the doors and NOTHING.  NADA.  Completely ignored.  We waited a few seconds.  AGAIN NOTHING.  Simple.  We left.  I decided to call their corporate 480 number.  Nothing but one voice mail after another.  Left a message... AGAIN NOTHING.  They did not bother to return my call.  These guys are CRAP and could care less about customers.  Fear not.  LOTS of great restaurants a couple of blocks south in Westgate.  Too bad one star is the worst rating."}
{"text":"Went there last night with some friends. We decided to sit in the patio since we get pretty loud and it seemed like everyone was watching the SUNS game in the lobby, so we were like, lets chill outside. So we walk up to the tables, one after another and they were all DIRTY and stank of beer. Checked atleast 8 tables and decided to eat in the lobby. Does anyone ever cleans the patio area? 3 stars is for the awesome and quick service. Wings came out right away and were deliciously seasoned. Wings were perfect. Please tell your waitresses to clean the patio once a month atleast."}
{"text":"I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed.  Here's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.  - When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?  - Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables.   - Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.  - WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location.   - Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly.   - Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us.   All in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for some beer and wings. It was pretty busy. We spotted an open high top table in the bar area so I asked the bar server if it was open seating and was told yes go ahead and sit down. Five minutes later the manager comes over and tells us that we need to get up that we can't sit there. Totally unprofessional I won't be dining here again and by the way we are regulars here. Oh and the only reason we go is because the wings are cheap on Tuesdays other than that the food is merely mediocre."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after placing a take out order. Got there early and was greeted by a  very friendly bartender who helped me out. Service was quick and I was in and out with my wings and flatbread. Always love this place!"}
{"text":"Not great service, wings taste good but on the shrimpy side. Do they even offer free refills?"}
{"text":"I get a dozen honey-hot wings with extra ranch, and I'm usually gonna be a happy guy. They'll over-cook them maybe 3-4 times out of 10, but they tend to be worth the money. For that reason I'm giving the place 2 stars. If I ever get appetizers, or another meal, things get even more dicey.  The problem with Native is, when the food is cooked well, it's great. It's just never cooked well. The potato skins are fantastic, unless they're dry and burnt. The fries are great, unless they're undercooked. The wings (bone-in) are flawless, unless they're charred. The boneless wings are fine, unless they taste like a dirty oven.  The waiters/waitresses are fine, but if you're getting take-out, check your food first, because they apparently don't. I've gotten home, only to realize one order is wrong and another is missing entirely.   If you want to watch a game, and you're ok with gambling on food, this is a fine enough spot. They play every NFL game live, you might not be able to hear yours, but if you don't have Sunday Ticket, or you have an aversion to streaming, it's an option."}
{"text":"Worst customer service by management. My husband placed a carry out for dinner. He had to repeat the order 3 times and when he picked it up it was still incorrect and or part of the order was entered by the staff. The manager told him the problem was because the staff member that took the order wears hearing aids. Why would a manager ever use someone's disability as an excuse?"}
{"text":"Kim...is UHMAZING. Kyle is pretty awesome too. But that's. About. It. The food is good 2/10 times. I've lost count at how many times my chicken sandwich, (I get the same thing every time) has come out undercooked or even over cooked. Like a shoe sole. It's rough like a cheap steak, and it's chicken. This time I had enough; I sent it back and got some fries. I didn't even get a replacement meal because I can guarantee it will be just as bad. I've given this place too many chances. AND to top it al off I still paid for the entire meal except the sandwich I sent back. DONE!!!"}
{"text":"The service is immaculate here. Best location hands down. I live on the west side and have 3 natives closer but I choose to come to this one bc the service is so good. The servers are so friendly and very hard working."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff especailly Amber the bar tender. They always go out of their way to make me comfortable.  They put whatever I reqest on the TV.  The food is always excellent. I also enjoy the Buzztime Trvia game."}
{"text":"We had came here with a big party to celebrate a friend's birthday party.  The service was great and they had great specials. There mix drinks were good as well as the pizza , wings and salads we had. Definitely recommend you go if your in the area."}
{"text":"Sorry Native but you let me down. My sliders had too much bread and not enough burger. My friend, who had a seed allergy,  specifically asked for no tomato,  and yet there were seeds because the message was not received. Service was a little slow as well and it wasn't crowded...."}
{"text":"Well the service here is terrible and it's more noisy than a cafeteria. After waiting forever to be helped and finally receive my food it was subpar to say the least. I recommend if anyone decides to eat here, do yourself a favor and turn around. Overall not satisfied at all with any aspect of this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places by far Even better then Grimaldi's Pizza had to give compliments to the chef great service loved the atmosphere very good our waitress made sure we were taking care of will be coming back soon for sure to try out the wings I hear those were pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"Native hits a nostalgic spot for me. I grew up with this place as a child and it was my to-go spot for sports games. I still believe it's one of the better places to grab a beer while watching a high impact game (I.e. Phoenix Suns or AZ Cardinals). This is because the place is pretty much covered with flat panel TVs all along the walls. No matter where you are sitting, it would be impossible to not have a great view of the TV screen.   The famous wings are 45 cents on Sundays (recommend: spicy honey mustard) and the Fish and Chips entree is quite delicious. You can get Coronas for $3.50 and a 22oz Budlight for $3.50. While the food is not memorable, for the value and a sports bar, it's decent.   Come here if you're looking for a local sports bar to watch a game. It will be a good time and the place is bound to be packed with Phoenix spirit!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I used to come here 1 to 2 times a week.  It was always my regular spot after softball for some wings and drinks.  It has been getting worse and worse and after this last time, I am not going back and will find a new wing place for after softball nights.  In addition to some pretty mediocre service, this place has some real crappy policies.  Some are just irritating like the fact if you order ranch with your wings, they are going to bring you 1 tiny cup.  Yep, 20 wings...1 tiny cup.  Feel free to ask for more and it will be cup by cup until you have enough.  One time our whole table had a cup each and they were filled half way!  The biggest issue for me is their decision at this location to essentially shut down the kitchen now 2 hours before closing.  That's right, this restaurant is open till 11pm during the week but we were there on 7/21 (Tuesday) and walked in 20 minutes before 9pm and one of the waitresses was giving us the stink eye.  We sat ourselves in the bar area and she came over and just dropped off some menus after about 10 minutes of sitting there and walked off, not a word said.  Another guy came over, was friendly and took our order but apparently they had already shut down the oven and so the individual pizza one of the kids ordered took about 25 minutes.  I get that the staff want to go home early or right after closing, it's obvious.  They had sections closed off at 9:15 for cleaning, including the bathrooms.  My issue is you work at a restaurant and food is a part of that business, not just alcohol.  Whoever runs this place needs to know that this place was really closed by 9:45 pm because no one came in as the waiters and waitresses were telling people the kitchen was closed and everyone that was there was gone by 10pm because we all know that without food, it isn't worth paying $5-$10 for a drink out!  Good luck to this restaurant, I doubt it lasts another year with these policies in place!"}
{"text":"Big Disappointment! Don't bother! Went there yesterday after a movie. We've been dying to go since it opened. We ordered the hot sauce on the wings and the strawberry hot sauce.  Wings were undercooked, served cold and tasted even worse! We told the bartender and he just said sorry and walked away. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I can't imagine why they're as busy as they are. The food has seriously decreased in taste and value over the years. They have a ton of tvs and a nice bar, the only reason I can imagine people frequent the establishment. I'm not a fan. Ordered wings, boneless wings, burgers, nothing was great."}
{"text":"I think this is the Native New Yorker that hits its demographic and executes its concept the best in the Valley.  After all, It is JUST a simple sports bar, with plenty of HD screens in good angles, beer specials and very good wings.  They maintain the feeling of a gamewatch spot better than the Mesa location, which appears to be more of a family dining spot, and reduce the frat-bar vibe of the Tempe location.   I would consider NNY's wings the best in the valley for anyplace NOT names Hazlewood's.  They have a great flavor, but they tend to mix in a few small afterbirth rejects into your basket and count them as one of your dozen.  No fair.  There is no reason to rush out and get to this NNY location if there is one by you, but if you are in Sprawltukee, its a more-than-suitable place to stop by for a serious game watch.  *Side note:  everytime I've watched a game of personal importance here, my rooting interest has lost.  If you are this type of superstitious sports fan like I am, you might want to be mindful of a possible jinx."}
{"text":"Service wasn't very good. We were seated and about 10 minutes passed by before a waiter showed up and asked has anyone taken care of you?  Our drink order was taken we gave a appetizer order. The drinks were dropped off but he didn't take our order. We clearly had enough time to decide. I had the lettuce wraps they were good my partner had the skinny Asian salad his chicken didn't look fully cooked and the butt end (core) of the head of lettuce was in his salad. It's not edible and took a lot of room up in the salad. This was our first time here and most likely our last."}
{"text":"Great food, kid friendly, and fantastic service .  We were there on football Sunday and were impressed!"}
{"text":"We came here with 35+ of our other friends to celebrate a birthday.  We made a reservation and we were giving an area near the bar.  Since we had little kids and celebration a 17th bday, we requested to be moved to the outside.  They heated up the patio and moved tables around for us.  It was nice that the servers lined up tables inside on the window so our food will keep warm.  The 2 servers did a wonderful job keeping our drinks filled and checking on us.  The pizza and wings were good!!!  It was fun, food was good, and service was nice."}
{"text":"My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.  Message from the Manager:  I have put you in my manager log for a dozen wings on us.  Please let us know immediately if there is ever a problem and we will happily correct it. If you wouldn't mind updating your yelp review stating that this has been resolved, we would greatly appreciate it.  That is nice that they really read the reviews.  I just have not had time to go back since December.  Thanks for reaching out to your customers."}
{"text":"Food is good but the girls who answer the phone can never write down the correct order when you order take out. You end up showing up to pick up your order and it never was put in. It's hard for them to cook your food the way you want it. ie - meat  well done"}
{"text":"The food and drinks where great. This place was full of specials from 55 cents wings to happy hour drink specials! The waiter was friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is your typical bar food kind of place.  We usually only go for happy hour....half price apps and drink specials.  Decent nachos, but the margaritas aren't great....although they're usually not at a sports bar."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at this restaurant. Food is always delicious and staff is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I love Native's Wings. I have been eating them for so long that I have seen their prices go up.  The service at this location has gotten a lot better. The hostesses are a lot nicer and actually have some personality. The servers are decent and actually care. The only thing I do not like is that they seem to change their menu items a lot. Overall enjoyed my wings and had a good meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to native and she ordered a salad, as she was eating it she noticed a black shell thing. At first she thought it was a olive but it turned out to be a cockroach shell. She then told the manager and the manger crunched it with his finger and said \"I'm not sure what that is, maybe pepper\" and thew it aside. He said I'll take the salad off the menu. For him not to knowledge he has bugs or apologize is horrible!! Who knows who else this has happened to and ate it. Or what foods the cockroaches has crawled on."}
{"text":"Much better than the previous years. Def worth checking out. Wings area off the hook.  Service has been great! Def will continue to frequent :)"}
{"text":"I have been there three times over the last month, and I am not impressed. Marginal service, cold food, quail wings, and not the quality of the past. This is a new change, I have been there in the past and it wasn't bad. I have been frequenting Native since 1986,  the original in Tempe and this franchise I will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the close spots that I would consider myself becoming a regular due to the connivence of their location for me and I'm happy to return! Service is always extremely friendly and helpful, fast and always right! They always know the happy hour specials and other menu ideas when I'm feeling indecisive. Great place and great food! There is a family dining area, bar and an outside patio with a flat screen and entertainment."}
{"text":"Went to Native last night for my son's birthday. It's been a while since we've been here. We sat in a booth in the bar area for faster seating. The service was descent. Bacon was left off my son's burger that was ordered, but no big deal. The server immediately brought it out when my wife brought it to her attention. We ordered a little 20 pack of hot wings  ($21.59 before tax). The wings on top were crispy and fresh. The bottom half barely contained sauce as they appeared to be sitting for an extended period. One could easily tell that the wings were from a different/old batch. It's not what you'd expect when paying over a $1.07 for each overpriced wing. The remainder of the food was average. I purchased the Native burger ($10.99). Honestly. I can easily purchase a better tasting burger from a fast food restaurant. My daughter purchased the Hangover burger also $10.99. I thought that was a descent looking burger. I would recommend that you purchase the Slider Triple, if it's not a limited time special. The sliders seem to provide a better selection. Anyhow, I hope my soon does not chose this place for his 13th Birthday, as I hope to not dine here again."}
{"text":"I was not impressed and the food was fair and I spend a lot of money. The place was very busy and cold. I will not return soon."}
{"text":"So its been 7 months since we have been to this native grill, and last time we were here our service was terrible. Not surprisingly it was the same today. My last review i said we would never be back but i thought i would give them another shot, but i should have just went to Applebee's. This time the food was decent no real issues, wings we finally good and crispy. But our waitress Trinity was the worst. Apparently she has issues getting orders correct because the people she helped at the table next to us she got wrong and she also got mine wrong. And when i let her know my order was incorrect she got defensive. Lastly once we were done with our food she disappeared for like 10-15 minuets, we were ready to pay the check but could not find her to ask for it. I had to ask her manager for a togo box and the check."}
{"text":"What a disappointing time tonight... place was packet but from seating to order to getting half our meals then other meals 35 minutes later, refill drinks with the wrong drink, miserable server... won't be back... horrible"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and mediocre service =a big pass in by at this place.  In our group of two adults and two children food was lemon lemon lemon.  We all lost.  I ordered the speciality buffalo chicken pizza but my chicken did a disappearing act because it was not there.  One of the kid had chicken strips but the chicken looked like it was electrocuted on a fence or something.  We had to ask for beverage refills.  My side salad looked dumped out of a bag.  Cheese also looked byproduct like.  To top it off the price was not too nice.  New Yorkers would not be proud of this Native..."}
{"text":"Always good for lunch! Portions seem a little smaller than I remember in the past but not positive.  I'll be back again! Regular spot for at least one lunch when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Not impressed as you can see by the one star. I have been to Native Newyorker many times, different locations and I have never been thoroughly impressed. With the new sign and switch up of their name I thought what the heck let's try this place again. So I patiently waited for the surprise location to open, I'm driving by one night and I see it's open so I swoop in. Turns out that it was the soft opening, family and friends night, a score for me because it was 50% off everything! Sat down decided I was going to try their blue cheese chicken nachos thingy appetizer (I can't remember the name) it came out and I took a few bites and felt like well this isn't that great, but at least they aren't horrible...and let's not forget it's 50% off!!! So I decided for my main meal I was going to get the pretzel bun sliders, and my husband wings... And this is where the one star comes in, the food was horrible. How could a place with wings in their name mess up the wings?!?? They did and I won't be back. Glad it was 50% off!"}
{"text":"We come to Native weekly for the past year.  We moved here last year and wanted to find a local place where we could go, relax and enjoy a decent meal.  We found it!!! We love Native!!.  The staff is excellent.  We usually sit in the bar area but it was packed and there would have been a long wait, so we sat in the dining room.  We had a great evening and great food.  Our waiter Chris was excellent.  He was so personable.  He made us feel welcome.  He was very helpful.  Chris told us about the Native app, but we told him we already have it on our phone.  We totally enjoyed our meal and the service.  Native has a lot of new faces and we were glad to meet Chris and have him take care of orders.  We will request Chris in the future.  Thanks Native!!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The atmosphere was terrible. The manager was terrible. We walk in and the music is blaring like you're at a rock concert. This is a restaurant, not a bar, regardless of the fact that it's Friday. Then we saw our server twice, the whole time we were there. She didn't even tell us her name and she couldn't hear us over the music to take our order. Then when I asked for a manager, he was SO rude. I complained about the service and music and his excuse was that it's karaoke night, and he offered absolutely no solution. He had to run around searching for our server for ten minutes while she sat there and sang karaoke, while she had tables. He was so beyond rude, especially for a manager. I would never go back, I never will and I will be contacting the general manager because that's not how you run a business.  I did speak with the GM, Cheryl, and she was terrific. It's possible it was just an off night because I have received great service from here before. Cheryl definitely resolved everything and made me feel like a valued customer and that's enough to get me back into a restaurant and now I know Friday is karaoke and I'll just avoid Fridays."}
{"text":"This place has TERRIBLE service. I've come to dine in twice with slow service and have also ordered online and on the phone twice and have still had to wait after coming in after the set pick up time. BUT the food is so good (pizza and wings) that I keep coming back. Lol. The strawberry hot wings are my favorite."}
{"text":"Go to any other Native. This one is TERRIBLE!  The girls on the phone are beyond rude. I spent 5 minutes explaining to one of them that balsamic dressing comes on the wedge salad and I didn't want any on mine. She still didnt get it. That was right before she hung up on me without giving me a pick up time.   Oh and when you do get a time? Buyer beware. If they tell you 25 min, it's more like 40. They won't toss your wings in sauce until you get there, and even when you do get there you're in line behind all the dine in and other take out customers. Even if you tell them to toss it beforehand, they don't. The manager will give you a $5 off coupon if you complain about the wait, but why do that when its so bad in the first place?  And let's talk about how the waitresses are all friends and hang out. If you dine in? Good luck on getting food within 40-45 min and forget drink refills. Hope you ordered the biggest beer and only wanted one. They're too busy with their friends to do their job.  Skip it - there's a great location off of Estrella Parkway not too far away where the waitresses aren't there to hang out with their friends, the food comes out like it should, and they're friendly."}
{"text":"Falcone was a spectacular server!! Thank you for such a fun experience. We enjoyed watching the Cardinals game and the good food today. Buffalo dip was my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and I'm visiting my cousins and they have been talking about this place and how good the wings are, So we went here Tuesday night and we was seated rather quickly. The first server we had was amazing even though we only had her for about ten minutes. I think her her name was was Tonya if I'm not mistaken, Then she came over and told us that Katie was go take over and that's where everything went wrong.So we ordered our food which took forever to come out, the asiago wings was extremely dry.By the time our drinks came out they were watered down because she took so long to bring them to us. From where we was sitting we could see she left them sitting at the bar. She barely came over to check on us, We had to flag her down every time we wanted something. The best part was the pulled pork queso dip, If I could give 2.5 I would because service suck but the dip made up for it.... I won't be going there again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why I rate a 1 one star....took hella long to take our order, when she did take our order and driks, our beer took 30 min. to arrive .  So our food go there but part of the meal they left our which was the salad.   Then our bill came in 3 3 diff xs. With diff total cosr and some things were put in our bill that we didn't order.  It was a hot mess! Not planning to go back to that Native."}
{"text":"Full bar but no wine list? The service was a joke, they all hung around the hostess stand, and again no wine list? Come on, get it together!"}
{"text":"I love the strawberry, apple, walnut, chicken salad with mango citrus vinaigrette. I would eat this everyday except that it's a bit spendy.  Nice atmosphere and clean too. The others with me enjoyed their meals as well. Will definitely be back in very near future!"}
{"text":"Twenty minutes seated without acknowledgment. Nothing. We have tried to eat here twice with exactly the same experience as the previous \"Native NewYorker\".  Spoke with a manager but sounds like it's a common problem. How sad but we will NEVER be back!! Went to Oreganos instead. Excellent service and Native could learn of few things in excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over a year. Last night I had the chicken lettuce wraps (without the chicken) and a side of fries and I have had the worst case of food poisoning. This is awful (almost going on 24 hrs now)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great wings & a very hospitable staff. My husband & I go every Tuesday for the 60 cents wings! You can also scan your receipt to get points for $10 off after you spend $100."}
{"text":"This place keeps sucking.  I have been about 10 times and only once was the waitress any hood the other times it takes forever to get ur food, they forget to fill drinks, just service sucks.  You tell the mgr and they don't do anything. I kept coming back because I was hopeful it would change but it does not.......I'm done coming here.  This place suck. Ceos and owners need to do a under cover operation here to see for themselves."}
{"text":"We went around 7:00pm and it was not busy at all, but we still had to wait about 8-10min to get our drinks!! The food is good but the service is extremely slow."}
{"text":"Server was not up to standards, we received our appetizer with our main entree.  DO NOT GET \"the potatoe skins\"  $8.49 for 7 half cut pieces of skin with cheese n bacon, so not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"had the house specialty pizza and definitely not the best i've ever had, but pretty good (albeit i was starving).  the wings were very tasty however,  still unsure if i'll order from there again. i feel there is much tastier pizza for much cheaper price at dominoes up the street."}
{"text":"Prices are good, beer selection is top notch, love the wings and the Happy Hour/ lunch specials.  Easily the best American restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Another great lunch.  Had the Asian Garlic wings. Mmmmm.  Once again great service from Christina C."}
{"text":"come here often we get a table on the patio and have kilt lifters and strippers (that is a chicken strip made like a wing)  always has cold beer thats why they get a 5 star the staff is always friendly and flirty"}
{"text":"Alexis was amazing tonight! My kids love wing night. Wings are also amazing. The beer is just an extra added bonus."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was terrible. Waited over 10 minutes to even put our name on the list to be seated, then when finally seated, it took more than 15 minutes to order drinks.   We decided to give them another shot today and again... 15 minutes to be seen and then we were told it's open seating. Not gonna be back."}
{"text":"Was having a great experience until we had a hefty bartender named Codi who had a serious attitude problem. There was an issue with who took our food order and she got an immediate attitude. She was defensive about the situation and didn't want to take responsibility for the mistake. After she came back from the kitchen she couldn't even speak to us about the problem. She just chose to avoid it by helping other guests. I finally asked her about the situation and she immediately got attitude so I asked to speak with the manager. She needs to understand the hospitality business and how she's there to serve the customer and to not give push back. It was terrible service and ruined the evening. I wish that it could have been different but  I'll just go to a different local bar. There's plenty of round and there's nothing special about this place. Especially about Native New Yorker their a Diamond dozen and they almost went out of business once I can definitely can see it happening again"}
{"text":"7:08pm on a Wednesday I ordered to-go and was told it would be 10 or 15 minutes. It is now 7:40 and nothing has come out. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, horrible service. Not sure if I will be back. I would suggest not paying until you get your food.  Edit-I finally received my food at 7:56pm."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to eat here because of the other reviews but I did and it was great! I actually ordered my food for pick up and waited a little longer than they had originally estimated, but when they came out with my food they went through the order and gave me extra wings for the wait. Ate them at home and everything tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Wings were really good and service was great! Little bit pricy, especially $4.29 for a side of fries that were cold and soggy."}
{"text":"Decent but often short staffed. Good chain for the area. Nice to have a chain makes Buckeye not feel as  rural as the other things in the area."}
{"text":"Came here after our friends asked us out to dinner with the kids.  When we heard there were TV's to watch the World Series, we were in. We like to support our local area food establishments.   We ordered a mix of bugers, pizza, sliders.  Service was very friendly but really slooooooow.   Pizza oven was \"backed up\" whatever that means and came out about ten minutes after the other food. Kind of expected to get something comped. The food was typical bar food, nothing I crave but good for watching sports."}
{"text":"My son and I love to go here and watch football.  Sometimes the whole family goes, there's something for everyone... even my 2 year old!  My son tried the pizza for the first time, I was suspect... LOL ...he loved it!  I usually stick with the wings.  The spicy honey mustard sauce is excellent.  They'll do them any way you like ... try this special request; Medium traditional wings sauce, grilled and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles with creamy ranch dressing on the side!  Dynamite!  Don't go looking for fine dining, go looking for a laid back atmosphere where you can watch the game, fill up on some good old fashioned bar food and have a good time with the family.  Consistently good!"}
{"text":"The food has definitely gone down hill. You don't get what you pay for. The food wasn't as flavorful as I remember it to be. This is definitely not the place for wings anymore."}
{"text":"this place used to be great...years ago. it has been declining since.  we stopped by tonight for pizza and wings. the pizza may have a new sauce, it is sweet. the crust is under cooked and not crisp.  the wings were good and that is the best I can say."}
{"text":"This was my sister and i's first time at Native, we're we're wanting to try this place out since it looked pretty good. We get sat down at a very frayed booth, and 5 minutes later a waiter comes to wipe down the table (which should have already been done who knows how long ago when the previous guests left), my sister orders her wings and I get my pizza and my wings. She gets 8 wings in when she finds 4 blonde hairs baked into her wings, my pizza had hair in the chicken, and wings were undercooked. Manager knocked off only a bit of the total cost, service was absolutely uninterested in their job and unhelpful. We're Never coming back."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in town, and the onion rings are the best. The service is great, always enjoy eating dinner there."}
{"text":"Good place to go for football. Wings are good. But the only jersey youll see here are cowboys fans. Could use some cleaning up and remoddeling but besides that its not bad way to spend a sunday."}
{"text":"This place seriously sucks ass my food is always poorly made, I've seen better meals from those cheap microwave meals"}
{"text":"My server was Ms. A (won't give whole name)  Took 30mins for food to come out for 1 bacon burgers 2 order of wings and chicken wraps. Then took long enough that I had to ask a different server for some 2go boxes. Can't say I was satisfied with the service, food was decent."}
{"text":"I am basing my review on their pizza and boneless wings.  I have not tried any of their other dishes to know how they are.  We got the pepperoni pizza and some honey hot boneless wings.  Both of these were much better than I had expected!  I was pleased with the flavor of the pizza and I looove pizza. If it's not good I will be disappointed! This did not disappoint.   The boneless wings come in a few different flavors but my favorite is the honey hot.  This meal makes for some good comfort food. We ordered out but I have dined in there many times as well. It's a nice clean atmosphere with TVs if you're into watching sports.  (Which I am not however the hubby is).   I don't really have any complaints about this place. It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, food not great. The wings were tasteless and I ordered a cheeseburger  that came out without any cheese on it. I told the waitress there was no cheese, she said it doesn't come with it. REALLY!!!!!!! Talked to Brittany the manager and the replacement would take to long so I had to order the fastest food which were the wings again. Check comes and I'm billed for them and my groupon wasn't taken off. This waitress is horrible!!!!! Brittany took care of it when I brought it to her attention, but there was No \"I'm sorry let me take care of it.\" From either the waitress or manager. Really bad customer service from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Wings and beer are good.  Sat in bar before Cardinals playoff game. Not too crowded which was nice.  Service was good not sure why others had bad service.  I will come again before a game, better than Westgate bars that are overcrowded"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came into the restaurant tonight 9/8/217 time about 6;30/7 pm . The dinner side where you sit was closed so we had to sit on the bar side. It was a bit crowed, so we found a table in the corner that wasn't cleaned yet so we stood by the table so someone could clean it before we sat down. That's when Taylor who was bar tending and taking care of her guest looked up and seen us came right over greeted us with very friendly smile and cleaned the table right away. She got us our menu and  went back to take care of the guest at the bar came right back over and took our order. She was very attentive, friendly, polite and prompt. I had to write something about her because she was awesome   great service"}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. This place is amazing. This is the go to spot for dinner. I mean that we like this specific location. These people are great. Best wings around. I dislike the new menu, they took the curly fries off, but that's small potatoes ( literally ) Please go here. Be open minded. And ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"We used to go there alot but we haven't in a while (wing size was tiny) so after the movies tonight we tried it and the wings were biiig... the only thing was my wings were cold. No big deal though there was a cute waitress there and they gave me more wings n saved the night.. I'm gonna say it was a fluke.... great service."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is a fitting name as it smells like New York, on trash day, in August. There was a strong rotten egg smell wafting through the place every few minutes during our visit, and not one staff member mentioned or apologized for it. Also consistent with New York was the terrible service. We sat at the bar and it took FOREVER to get a second beer from the bartender. He was busy flirting with some middle aged soccer moms for so long that we had to yell and stop him to get a second drink. He didn't deserve the tip we gave him. Food was bland and mediocre at best, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent wings (and other food).  The wings they have here are outstanding.  I don't know what I've been estimating in California but these were wonderful.  We had several different orders of wings at our table which were perfectly spiced and produced a great need for hand wipes and napkins.  The Honey Dijon (?) was excellent and so were the different barbecue sauces we had ours cooked in.  They came out perfect, were chewy, succulent, and left us wanting more.  Beer prices are good, but they didn't have a wide number of brands on tap.  What I purchased was very good, but I didn't like it -- purely a personal choice, and had nothing to do with the beer.  My second choice was very good.  One thing I do want to say about their beer: it was chilled absolutely ice cold!  (What bar in Phoenix, you might ask, sells beer that's not cold enough?  Most of them, I'm afraid.)  Any colder and we would have had frostbite on our hands.  It was perfect for S very hot afternoon.  Very good customer service.  Excellent food (everything that we tried, at least).  Moderately expensive (but what isn't any more?). Ya get whatcha pay for, yanno?  I'll always remember this as the place with the red-hot wings and the ice-cold beer!"}
{"text":"I should have listened to the horrific reviews before we went in but we were starving and by the time we were going thru them- we had already been seated.  The WORST possible service EVER. It was 7:30 On a MONday night- there were maybe 5 or 6 tables and yet it still seemed to take the waitress 12 min to bring waters. Not to mention the diet coke which she finally brought as a doctor pepper. 10 min later I get a diet coke and its flat. Ok, not her day personally but it sat on the edge of the table untouched the whole time and she didn't even acknowledge it.  Food was boring and mediocre to say the least, salad was wilted and calzone was runny and burnt.   seriously an hour and a half later she finally rolls around to check on us and bring the check, we mention the diet coke being flat and she apologized and took it away. Brings the check and the coke is on there. Ask her to please comp the soda which she says ok too, we give the card, bill comes back, the bill has now been charged WITH the soda still on. Let's not forget that she disappeared with the card and bill for an extra 8 min, yes I was counting.   All and all, someone needs to get involved- like maybe a manager or someone who knows how to run a restaurant. This is absolutely unacceptable. And the whole vibe of the place was the same so j highly doubt it was just our one waitress."}
{"text":"We came in for .69 wing Tuesday. We were sat right away. Service  was amazing. Jordan took great care of us. Especially her attention to detail. The wings were GREAT, the pizza was amazing and we got all our food pretty quickly for how busy it seemed. The manager, Cisco, he stopped by to check on us and was very kind and helpful. Overall it was a great experience. We will definitely be coming back :))) thanks!"}
{"text":"A big letdown. I have been to the Ahwatukee location a handful of times and have had decent experiences. There was nothing decent about this experience.  First, we arrived at about 635p and happy hour ends at 7. We did not anticipate getting there in time for happy hour, but we were so that was a bonus in my mind. However, the hostess said there would be a wait even though there were 2 empty tables and one empty booth within sight. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were just about to ask what was wrong with the empty tables when she sat us at the very booth that had been sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. WTH? The waitress asked for our drink order and my old lady asked if it was still happy hour prices, and the waitress said \"if it is before 7\". WTF? The answer is a yes or no. I checked my phone and said it was 650p, so is that yes?  Then I asked if they had Guinness on draft, since there were HH prices on import drafts. She said \"yes, but there's no specials on Guinness\". \"What about this list of HH prices?\"  \"We don't do those anymore.\"  \"So none of these prices are valid?\"  \"Let me check\" As for the food, yawn. The wings were not nearly as good as what I have gotten at the Ahwatukee location.  The Guinness did taste good though.  The old lady got a skinny Rita which was also a HH special, but they overcharged us for it. By that point, I was so sick of the servers attitude, I just paid it and took the difference out of her tip. Needless to say, the next time we are looking for wings in this area, someone else is getting our business."}
{"text":"I haven't been a regular to native, mainly because they didn't deliver until I used the Amazon app. I have had some issues with their service over the past 2 orders I have made. First issue was they forgot my 4th slider even though it had been paid for (Amazon refunded the money) but we had a guest that didn't get their dinner which is a bummer. The second time I ordered, they got the order correct, however, the hot wings I ordered were dry, as of the sauce was cooked into the wing (or they had a dry rub). Also, my honey hot wings were so over cooked that the bone would snap if you bit down too hard. As I mentioned before, I am not a regular of this establishment, but I do feel like their wings are overdone."}
{"text":"We are new in town and dropped in on a Saturday evening to check things out.  We walked in to a mostly empty place and soon learned why it was empty.  With nobody to greet us we made our way to the bar where a small group of seniors were found...they appeared to be regulars.  I asked the bartender why they don't turn down the lights.  He thought I was joking.  The atmosphere was uncomfortable so we had one drink and left.  Management is not paying attention.  When I walk out of a joint like this, the odds of returning are slim."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hotel across the street so went here to get some beer and wings. Not bad but not to great either, the service was slow in getting back to the table to see if we needed anything else and was even slower when we kept ordering another round of beers. Seemed like the waiter kept dissapearing when you needed him to be around."}
{"text":"I will not go back. I wanted a nice quite dinner for my family.  But instead of a cozy resturant we walked into a brightly lit, fast food feeling, and dinner. Our waitress did an ok job making sure we had what we needed. But when I asked another waiter to refill my daughter's drink, I watched the glass get passed to two others before the third finally took care of it.  The staff was more interested in chatting amongst themselves, while  a handful lingered at their tables, visiting way to long leaving the other tables to just wait.    Honestly the wings, buffalo nachos, lettuce wraps were ALL good. My husband didn't like the hangover burger.  We won't return because the atmosphere was just awful."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in tonight as a last minute decision. Our server was Cassandra and she was prompt and very attentive. We started with the new meatball appetizer and it was delicious. My wife ordered wings and I ordered the stripper platter in jalapeño flavor and it comes with fries. Cassandra brought everything out rather quickly and it was as delicious as usual. Once again it was too much food for us to eat so we took the rest home. I will say the service was the best we've had. Cassandra was great, a very kind young lady. Definitely one of our favorite spots.  Edited 3/16/18 This update to the review is from our last visit about a month ago. Haven't had time to update. Native was our go to place for good food with good, quick service at an affordable price. However our last three visits the service had been extremely slow. From getting simple iced tea on our table to waiting well over 30 minutes for our food from the time we placed our order. I'd understand if they were very busy but they weren't. The food is still good but not as good as it used to be, combine that with the fact that it's taking us about twice as long on our visit it will be a while before we go back, if ever. It's a shame. We would visit 2-3 times a month typically."}
{"text":"My hotel was horribly located and had no amenities (Spring Hill) so the only room service was a delivery from this place.  I held off ordering but on the 3rd day in town I broke down (I don't like ordering off site- unless it's pizza). I ordered boneless wings and a rack of ribs (lunch and dinner).  I declined paying extra for a salad when asked.  The food arrived very promptly, even though I ordered during the lunch hour, and the young woman who brought it had a BIG smile...not a perturbed look like most delivery persons! The ribs didn't have the sauce on them, which I like but I know some people don't.  The sides were very minimal (I counted 11 steak fries)!  I should have ordered the salad.  The wings were their \"hot\" flavor but barely had spice to them.  I would say it was a mild sauce (I usually order medium). All of the food was barely warm on arrival. Finally, they were kind enough to give me plenty of plasticware and condiments. Improvements: simplify your LARGE menu, offer sauce on the side for wings, and use foil in to go orders."}
{"text":"We have come to this Native a few times now and the service is the same.....just not very good.  We go for the $.49 wings on Tuesday, but the service unfortunately isn't worth .$49"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!  DO NOT GO HERE! Ate here around 12:00 noon on a Sunday. Service was extremely slow and they barely had any customers. The food was terrible. Ordered onion rings for an appetizer and received them 15 minutes later, not even hot, more like room temperature. A plate of about 8 onion rings for $5. Could have done better at Sonic for the price! I don't know where our Server was, but she was gone for so long that a different Server came to take our order because she noticed we were sitting there forever. The Server who took our order didn't write anything down and didn't bring the correct amount of wings that I ordered. She also didn't tell me when I ordered that Traditional wings don't come with any sides, so the Tater Tots I ordered, were an extra $5 for an appetizer size, when I just wanted a small side! When the wings and tenders arrived, they were room temperature/cold. The wings were so dry, I almost choked. The tenders were tasteless. We were starving and didn't even finish our meals. We never got drink refills and no one checked on us while we ate. We sat there with our plates piled on top of each other and pushed to the side (indicating we were done) for another 15 minutes until someone came to see if we wanted dessert. We asked for our check. We wasted $40 at this terrible establishment and left still hungry!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I said this place was total crap it would be the best complement this place has probably ever received!"}
{"text":"The wings are pretty good. The service was fair. The place is either under construction or has the worst decorators in town. The table chairs are narrow and uncomfortable. The booths are the best place to sit since there is no noise reduction, and with the t.v.s blaring or the music playing so loudly- it is not a good place to go for a conversation meal."}
{"text":"Helping out on the reviews  for this place.  Good neighborhood  hang out. Staff is friendly. Food is good . Nikki, the server is attentive and makes sure u r taken care of.  Give it a chance"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location Yes it is new and very nice on looks but that is the only nice thing about it. The strippers are no longer the same I ordered 6 only to receive 4 I was told they could not fit on the plate lol horrible excuse.  It was also full of flies all over the restaurant   Nasty!"}
{"text":"Over all everything was pretty bad. Came at 12:30 and sat in the bar. Only had the bar tender serving the bar and tables so service was pretty slow. Had traditional wings that I felt came from Kentucky Fried Chicken. I understand the bar tender was busy (mostly talking to her friends. At one point her daughter came in with her kid in a car seat which she sat on the bar and the bar tender disappeared with her for about 10 minutes). Bar tender also doesn't know how to pour a beer. Definitely will find another place to go have a beer and wings."}
{"text":"Wow, just moved to the 'hood and was excited to have a Native so close by, but really disappointed with this location. Went in at 2:30pm for wings and a beer and the place was pretty slow. Yet the most of the booths in the bar area still needed bussing from the distant lunch crowd. We found one that appeared semi-clean and sat down. The table top was \"clean\" only as far as the busser could stretch the wipe down rag across the surface. The entire back half of the table was sticky. I ordered an \"ice cold beer\" (that's a quote) and a 6-pack of wings off of a sticky menu. My companion ordered a salad. The server brought out a couple of empty appetizer plates, utensils and extra napkins. The surfaces of the plates that were brought out were grimy to the touch and the bottom of one of them had visible remains from previous use. The beer, wings and salad arrived. The beer should have been MUCH MUCH colder, the wings looked old and the salad looked like salad. My companion picked up a pepper shaker to use on the salad and commented on how it, too, was grimy. The wings texture, indeed, was as old and leathery as they looked.  *UPDATE* Well, I reluctantly returned to this location with a group that just had to have Native wings. Nothing is hot enough for them so they have to have the Ghost! I was pleasantly surprised with a much improved experience and have bumped my rating from 1 to 4 stars. The table we sat at shined, the menu I ordered off of looked like I was the first to use it. The app plates sparkled. Very nice. My wings came out hot and looking good, cooked to order. Was the beer colder? I'm not sure if I noticed as I was enjoying my wings too much. Maybe they had a bad day previously, but I'm glad I returned. Well done, Native."}
{"text":"Native is a solid 3-Star joint. It can flucuate Plus or Minus a Star depending on YOUR mood. For me, this Native consistently ranks 4 Stars.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the beer is cold, and the TV's are a-TVin' and one's bound to be tuned to something you want to see (if not just ask and they'll change one for ya). What more do you need? Well, let's talk about food then. They've got tasty stuff.  Things I can def recommend:   Wings and Native Strippers - Take your choice, get both, ya can't lose.   Burgers and sliders - Made to order, very tasty.   Five Cheese Grill - This Jedi/Ninja of grilled cheese sandwiches will ruin you for other grilled cheeses.   Onion rings - a recent discovery - OMFG... so good.   Chicken Parm - awesome just make certain you have extra sauce.   Fish and Chips - just right.  Two things I def CAN'T recommend:   Never stick yourself in the eye with a fork.... and   Native Flat Bread Pizzas - I would pay a handsome sum to NEVER AGAIN eat any of these cardboardy dessicated atrocities. Oh the humanity! Bleech {cough}    So, 4 STARs. Just don't step in any of that Flat Bread Pizza."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Loved the Turkey in the Rye sandwich. My husband had Chicken strips. $7.00 lunches is a great price. Food and service was really good."}
{"text":"Thank you KC and Staff for helping us throw an extremely successful pancake and car wash fundraiser.  You went out of your way to make this a success!  Great food... great location!  Sincerely,  Vendetta Softball"}
{"text":"I would have showed my food but it was so good I didn't time to take a picture haha! The beer is good, the chicken salad wrap is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING! Didn't give 5 stars because the food was just ok! A dinner salad comes with tomatos and cheese. So if you don't like one or the other, you have a pretty bland salad! Also my fiancé got a pork slider that was all fat and had to be sent back. The potato skins were half off (thanks to yelp) because I would have been pissed if I had to pay full price for them! But again our server was amazing! Jason had a personality and really took care of us! Definitely a valuable employee since we have to make up for the not so great food! And it was FREEZING in the bar. Says me, a girl, and my fiance who is never cold and from CO!"}

{"text":"Had the WORST experience at this Native New Yorker.  First they gave me a dirty greasy glass of water, then we had to flag a waitress down after waiting fifteen minutes just for someone to acknowledge we were sitting there.  After waiting 25 minutes for an appetizer we got up and left to the Native in Tolleson and had food in 12 minutes.  The WORST!  The service is getting worse and worse at this location and it's DIRTY.  DON'T EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, fish and chips (substituted a salad), philly cheese steak and the 10 piece wings. Had them delivered to our hotel.  The pizza was good, they forgot the salad and no tarter sauce. Cheese steak was good. Not bad for the price and delivery was pretty quick.  They did come back after we called and delivered the salad they initially forgot."}
{"text":"Consistently good! We have been here many times and rarely have problems with the food or service. The pizza can be greasy sometimes which is why I am only giving 4 stars. The family meal deal is a great buy. A large pizza with 2 dozen wings or 2 lbs of chicken strippers for $29.99. We always take half home and have plenty for other meals."}
{"text":"Went last night and the experience was VERY disappointing. Been here before a while back and it had been much better. The service was really slow which was surprising since we were one of only a few in the entire restaurant. I ordered a alcoholic drink which cost me $8.00 but it turned out to be one of the most \"watered down\" drinks I have ever had. I had the sliders which were ok.  They were certainly nothing to get excited about. I was expecting something with a lot of flavor but was really let down when I finally got to try them. The wings (which is what this place was known for) were a little bit better but one of the reasons we had stopped at this place was because they were supposed to have a \"special\" on the wings.  It turned out to be a bait and switch scam- the \"special\" was only on some obscure hours which would normally never qualify! To add insult to injury, when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands because ALL of their food is greasy and messy, to my SHOCK, there was NO paper towels!! They only have the \"air dryer\" thing which is ridiculous for that type of restaurant. When I complained to the manager about it, he informed me that the owners of the restaurant had the paper towels \"removed\" from the bathroom!!??  Really??? Are they THAT stupid?? Or perhaps they really don't care about the needs of their customers?? And with the greasy, messy, kind foods they serve, they thought that was acceptable? It's bad enough that fast food places are not offering paper towels but now a full blown restaurant is doing the same thing? That alone has given me cause to never come back. The rest could at least be chalked up to a \"bad night\" but not this. I would definitely recommend to others that this place be avoided.  There are better restaurant choices, especially for wings."}
{"text":"Yet again another wonderful experience for some tasty wings. Caitlyn and Devon were non stop checking our refills and food to make sure we were all taken care of. Carrie checked in on us a few times too to make sure we were all taken care of and were enjoying the playoffs and our scrumptious wings. I travel past two natives to come to this location every week. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Native for their wings! Tuesdays. Thursdays. Game day. We come to Native for wings. We met friends here as this was somewhat of the halfway point. Decided to sit outside to enjoy the cooler temp. Choice of 2 patios! Awesome! We choose the less crowded, non fire pit one. Put in our order for wings, burger, pizza, salad, & kids meals. Our smiling waitress brought out drinks after our order. I can't remember seeing her again. Outside. One of us would see her inside. We had to go in for straws for all the drinks since the kids cups have kids. Food was brought out in several trips by someone else. We went back in for napkins & silverware though. The food was wonderful as usual. We enjoyed our time together. Despite sending one of us in for miscellaneous items is annoying.  We had just as much fun at McDonald's next door for coffee & desert. We're not above self service but we just didn't expect it at Native. Maybe it's a new thing. Maybe it's a Gilbert thing."}
{"text":"Wings are always consistent and delicious. Service is above average. Prices are typical for a bar/wing/pizza joint. Good atmosphere.   Love the Asiago Parmesean dusted wings and the Medium is darn near perfect."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location, but was happily impressed. Newly redone inside from what my friend told me. Pizza is great as always - love the buttery crust. Wings are consistently among the top 3 on my list of good wings like in Arizona. Service was good, we got there early in happy hour so it wasn't too busy yet. Beer was good enough I had two tall ones - good selection on tap too :-)"}
{"text":"I called today to see if they would be showing the Arizona-Wisconsin Elite 8 game. The response I got was, \"We don't play Arizona games anymore. I think the Glendale location does.\" Really?!? We have an Arizona team in the Elite 8 and you won't play it on at least one TV?? This is a major game and a local team! If that's their stance I will not ever patronize their establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work for a cocktail and food.  The spicy fish sliders were delicious.  Great drink and affordable prices."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my boyfriend. Great chicken salads and chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"This Native used to be good! We have been coming here for a long time. Leadership needs to look at what is happening now before you lose all your customers! Food is good! Service is lack luster!  * Seated on a diamond backs game day. Fairly busy. * two servers for the entire restaurant? * took forever to get beer order and the bartender just standing there! * they got the wing order wrong and did not go above and beyond to fix it! * Discount for error? * No silverware at the table? * waiter did not ask to get silverware after delivered a salad? No napkins with wings? Basic table waiting! Should not have to ask.   Omar was the server this trip. Quiet service and did not have the personality to do this job. Come on! You made the mistake on the wings at least comp the mistake. Basic service! Do not make your customers ask for comp on your mistake. We will pay for your mistake but may not be back. Your loss!  Overall this place has slipped! Get your act together if you want to stay in business. Quite sad this day and age when customer service is EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Just showed up at 11:40 for some wings and I got shut down and told they are having a major system failure and cannot ring up anything. I had to leave with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since 1993. Okay, so the food isn't amazing, but they do what they do best...wings and beer and sports. The wings might be fantastic, since they offer many sauce flavors, but I don't know since I don't eat meat. My sister loves the honey BBQ while my dad loves the extreme spicy one. The staff is friendly and always fill up my cherry coke (coke with cherry syrup AND extra cherries.)   As for the women's bathroom, yeah it's small but it's not the worst in the world. There is always toliet paper and soap and paper towels. I've been to some really bad bathrooms before and this was not one of them.  We don't go there for sports, but it's a fun place for your family to sit down, eat food, and enjoy company."}
{"text":"Was here a few days ago and we had pretty good service and the food was good as well so overall probably come back BC sometimes don't want to drive further."}
{"text":"This is one of the most friendliest places to go and have an ice cold beer.  Megan, Kari, and staff are awesome. The jukebox has some of the best music around.  We really enjoy hanging out here."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends for happy hour had the chicken strippers they we're tasty the sauce was just right also had the jalapeño poppers which were cheesy and spicy. Also had some great cocktails overall a nice night."}
{"text":"Straight up wing heaven. Been going to this location for YEARS! Service? Great! Food! They're \"more than just great wings\"...but I go for the wings. Most important? Beer!  I've never received bad service here. Attentive, pleasant, and prompt."}
{"text":"Visited Native Grill on a Saturday night for the UFC fight. We arrived around 5:45pm. We sat outside on the patio where there wasn't too big of a crowd compared to inside.   Our server was horrible during our whole duration of being there! We stayed until the end of the UFC fight which was about 10:30pm or so. A good 4 hours or more of bad service!   She took extremely long with our drink orders. Forgot to put in our food order and came by to check on us every 45 mins or longer and makes a comment such as 'you drink fast', I wanted to say, 'no, you're just slow'   We ordered two half dozens of wings. (Teriyaki and chicken and waffles) But after almost 5 hours and between the 3 of us we were still hungry. We didn't want to order anymore food there because of the horrible service and the thought of having to wait an hour for the food. After the fight we chose to dine elsewhere for dinner.   Service could use some work."}
{"text":"I don't expect the best service ever out of a sports bar, but I do expect to at least have decent service.  The other night I got off work around 8 PM and I was hungry. So, my boyfriend and I decided to head over to the Native as it is down the street from the house and is open relatively late (we don't like to be THOSE people who think it's okay to come into a restaurant 30 minutes before they close only to force the employees not to get any of their side work done). This was the very first time we had ever been to this Native location, but we have been to many others. We get there, walk in, and are greeted immediately by the hostess... but then things took a turn.  We are seated at a high top table near the bar and notice that there are only two servers working, one of which is the bartender. After sitting there for 15 minutes our server finally greets us. It isn't the bartender, it's the other guy. He isn't really polite, he isn't really rude, just sort of there. Really there wasn't any sort of facial expression. Okay, so maybe he was having a rough night? We notice there are 3 other tables inside of the restaurant and another 2 outside and a few people at the bar. The bartender is taking one table and the few people at the bar. Then another larger party comes in and sits down. This is when our server just becomes completely unable to do his job. Maybe he was overwhelmed? After about 20 minutes of sitting there with just drinks he finally assumes we are ready to order. (You think?) I order a plain cheese pizza with a few sides of ranch and we order mozzarella sticks to start off with.   The mozzarella sticks came out decently fast but when my boyfriend asked for ranch with those, it took 5 minutes. (Oh btw, we were literally right by the kitchen). Ranch comes, fine, whatever. We are the mozzarella sticks. Another 20 minutes pass, finally the pizza is out. No ranch. When the server FINALLY comes around, I ask for ranch. He says okay. Comes back drops it down, I say thank you, no response. At this point I think he's stressed because he's the only one taking the tables. There is a couple on the patio, they ask to see a manager. Manager goes over and continuously shakes his head in acknowledgement to what the customers are saying. After a few minutes, the manager walks back in, only to be stopped by another table (the larger party I mentioned before) because they had been waiting almost 20 minutes to place their order. They had kids with them, which might indicate they were needing to get out of there soon. The manager, shocked, says, \"Oh no! We haven't taken your order?\" And then scrambled around to find a notebook, takes the order. At this point we had been ready for a box for a while and were just sitting back waiting for the restaurant to literally fall apart. The manager walks by our table, we both stare at him (hoping he will ask us if we want a box) he makes eye contact, ignores us. We wait longer for the server to eventually make his way back. At this point my card is already on the table. And he comes back and finally asks us if we are ready for the check, and I interject, \"and a box please\". He comes back a few minutes later with the box and check and I hand him my card there. He takes my card runs it and brings it back, we sign the check and leave. As we are leaving though, we can see the manager scolding our server in the kitchen.   Look, I've been a server, it's stressful, I know. If you're a server and you're overwhelmed, ask for help, if you're a manager, and your server is overwhelmed, ask him how you can help. If you're the bartender and you have far less customers that your coworker, ask them how you can help.   About the only competency I saw from this trip was the two hostesses who were really polite and prompt. Other than that, I really hope this was just an off night for this Native location.    My boyfriend and I are not typically people who will complain to a restaurant... if you look at most of my reviews, they're positive... but this one was just too icky of an experience to ignore."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I haven't had anything I didn't like here. Great atmosphere and service. One of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"The service! Omg !!, terrible, the wait to get a drink or order even get the check to pay is like pulling teeth, I know it's new but it was dead in this place ! I'll probably try it again in a couple of months to see if it gets better ,,"}
{"text":"We have ordered here thru online APPS and takeout. All is consistently bad. Tonight was the worst customer service yet! Surprise Food Delivery gets 5 stars though for trying to make the best. The owner called the manager here to let them know our Cobb salad NEVER was presented the way it was tonight- hardly any lettuce, chicken and different container that made the entire salad less appealing. I wish I had taken a picture previously. My boneless native stripppers which I always get with extra honey bbq sauce came with zero sauce and our shredded queso was about half the normal serving. Overall epic fail. Manager came back and said he would redo wings ONLY. Wow. Terrible terrible. So I get the strippers again with basically chicken fingers and some bbq sauce on the side. Guess we will not be going back here any longer."}
{"text":"This place is like every other Natives, serves really good food and wings. Their placement on tables and seats are kind of weird. We were seated at a table that's right next to the door."}
{"text":"This location is pretty crappy. There's a hotel that shares the parking lot so sometimes you won't have parking during dinnertime. It was just a group of 2, a friend and I at around 8:30, I realize it's a bar but it was way to loud. We were also sitting in the resturant area and not the bar area. There was 2 group of people watching basketball and causing a riot. I'm assuming they were drunks. The food was good, but the service was kind of crappy too. They didn't really pay attention to us and it took a while to flag someone down to get their attention. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Upside:  Angel - she is an amazing server.  The Downside:  The food.  Dry burgers and sliders (nothing will juice these up trust me)  This is the fourth time and I'm just done.  The BEST NATIVE GRILL IS AT POWER AND RAY ROAD.  My favorite hamburger ever and all of the servers are as awesome as Angel."}
{"text":"Two stars, why? Because the service is a hit or a miss. My first visit, the servers were very attentive. Second time  around, I sat at the bar, and the service was horrible.Bartender  disappeared for a awhile, and never really checked on me.To add, it was very hot inside, which made my visit worse.I might give them another chance, hoping  my experience wasn't like the previous."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the past year or so.  I was really disappointed with the service and quality of the food.  I would rather go to BWW for good wings.  Waited forever for beer.  Used to be a great after work stop, now not so much."}
{"text":"It's a shame how people just don't care about quality anymore!!!! This is the second time that I've had poor quality food from this particular Native N Grill......"}
{"text":"Been sitting here with my kids for 15 minutes without a waiter or waitress even coming to the table to take a drink/water order. Went back to the front to let them know.....10 more minutes and still nothing. Worst service EVER! Terrible management."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this place, even bragged about it. Unfortunately the last 4 times I've been there the food has been terrible. This last trip was the last straw for me, wings had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp. They were dried up with hardly any sauce on them. Tasted like I was eating last weeks dinner! I kept going back hoping it was gonna be like the old days but RIP Native. Wish I could get our $50 back!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite after work stop. The food is always great and they have my favorite drink. We have different waiters but tonight we had Preston and he was very nice and on top of our orders. Great customer service :) -"}
{"text":"Their fries burger and customer service department are in some desperate need of help. Stood around at the front desk for at least 10 minutes looking for an employee to greet me. The place was pretty much dead and I actually walked around looking for a \"Pickup\" booth. After standing around like an idiot for a few more minutes at the front I had to call them just to let them know I was standing at the front counter. I ordered the California burger for takeout, to say the least it was absolutely terrible. The patties were very plain bland and dry, seriously guys my 4 year old could have grilled me up a better patty in the backyard. No seasoning, no salt, no pepper no nothing. To top it off the lettuce was soggy dark and looked old. Anyways the burger was so bad that even my lab wouldn't eat it. We will make sure people know not to waste their hard earned money and time here. Next time I'll head over next door to McDonalds and order the chicken sandwich for better food and better service."}
{"text":"Every one has their specialty. Natives is the buffalo ranch dry rub wings.  There are 2 sections. The bar is hidden past the bathrooms but that where you'll find all the singles and the fun. The menu ranges from salads to pizza but wings are their specialty and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Well, this location went bad. Wings were small, celery were sliced so thin you could see through them. Prices were really high, unless you got the daily special. It's close to the house, but we will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Great food with an extensive selection of wing sauces and rubs that is sure to satisfy any wing connoisseur. The blackberry lemonade makes the meal complete. Most importantly, the service by Amber is top notch. She is a gem who always greets us with a smile and sets the standard of customer service. From us in the service, we thank Amber for her amazing service!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience here. The girls up front are retarded and made me and my wife wait 55 mins for a 10 mins wait when they sat 6 families in front of us. The service is sub par and the food is decent, can't knock the wings. We will be telling everyone we know to not come to this place. It's really sad as the other native by our house is a lot better. We will be going to power and chandler heights from now on, they rock."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our road trip from San Antonio to Los Angeles, and I was initially very excited, I love wings and tailgate food and all that.  We both ordered cocktails, mine was a Blackberry Sangria, which was not mixed properly and his was a Strawberry something that didn't even seem to have an alcohol in it at all.  So we're like \"okay, maybe the bartender is tired, no biggie\".  Ordered chicken \"strippers\" (what.the.hell) and boneless wings with a couple different sauces.  The sauce seemed like maybe it had been watered down or something.  The only good point is that it seems like they use much less breading than other places on the wings and so they are probably a touch less bad for you than the super breaded wings at other places. Our server was very sweet and kind, especially for so late in the day.  As far as food goes though - will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! It's overpriced and the service is bad. The food is a poor imitation of bar food. It is also a cop trap so be very careful when leaving."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all of the negative reviews because our experience was excellent! We went to Native today to watch football. The place is immaculate. Our server was outstanding! Derek was attentive and on top of it. We came with 6 people, and Derek kept our drinks and bellies full. The wings weren't great, but we also had cheeses ticks, flat bread and tater tots, and they were all really good. My bloody Mary was great--spicy and yummy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in with two paying parties. Some how the tickets for mixed up in the kitchen and other tables got in between the tickets. So one party got the food and the other other had to was over an hour. Not impressed at all. The food is not that food to wait that long."}
{"text":"I waited 11 minutes just for my server (Travis) to acknowledge me and take my drink order. It took him another 3 minutes to bring my drink to me (an iced tea no less) and to take my order. Plus another waiter had to remind my server to bring me my drink ... Not good service at all."}
{"text":"I kinda like the Native New Yorker. I mean, if trashy bathrooms isn't your bag, this might not be either. By that same token, I can think of quite a few other places where the bathrooms are considerably worse than here.   They have some wicked happy hour specials on wings and other greasy snacks and even regular priced pitchers of beer aren't bad.   It's a refreshing alternative to the stuffiness of most Scottsdale bars and even somewhat in comparison to bars on Mill. Ideal with about four people and no schedule."}
{"text":"The soda was flat.  The pizza was decent.  Thin crusted and crispy and delicious.  Not too spicy and not too bland.  The wings were acceptable.  She asked for all drumsticks but we ended up with half and half anyways.   The mozzarella sticks were quite good.  But the soda, was still flat.  Our server was attentive and courteous.  He even brought us new sodas, which were still flat.  There were various sports games on plenty of televisions all over the establishment.  This might have been a selling point if I had any interest at all in watching sports.  All in all it was way too much food, but I had a decent time anyways.  I would go back and order half as much food and an iced tea."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite of mine but things have been going to he'll. 20 minutes in between beers, apps out same time as food, and order was wrong. I feel like the bar area should be better staffed to avoid the slow service and order errors. The one redeeming quality is the amazing prices on beer."}
{"text":"Overall my worst experience at Native. Will not be returning to this location. Upon entering the restaurant stood in of the girl at the entrance who looked at us and said nothing just rolled her eyes. No one greeted us or asked if we needed a table until I asked her for a table for two.... to what she responded there was a wait time ... which felt more of a ok you should just leave rather than we will seat you as soon as possible. The place was empty compared to other locations there was at least 15 opened tables. We were seated in about 5-7 minutes which made me feel a little better.   It took about 15minutes for our sever to come by to take our order because she was too busy chatting with other customers.   Ok placed our order .... 20 minutes later our food is not here. We see everyone else get their food. I look for our server and of course she is chatting with the same customers 5 min 10 min .... until another server brings out our food which was no cold at that point. To end this mess... I asked for a side of hot sauce which never made it to our table.    Will not be returning to this location ... much rather drive further for better service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and my latest visit was probably the worst. The server seemed very rushed with our table, and was not attempting to be friendly. Our food was dropped off by another person, who promptly left without asking if we needed anything. We didn't have any silverware, and someone from our table had to get up and walk to the front and get it out of a pile they had. We were not here on a busy night, and our server spent a good portion of the night conversing with the table behind us. He also told the table how much tv he got to watch at work. Yikes. Overall, the food is consistent every time, and the service is usually good but never this bad. 1 star for my last experience, but 3 star for my overall time here, and at least the back of the house can cook food fast and correctly."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, really...just know what to expect.  Stick to the wings, not much else seems to be all that great.  The beef on weck is the best thing I've had here, next to the wings.  Though, they do have Kiltlifter on tap, TVs everywhere, and the kitchen is open until 2am, which gives me a reason to come back.  A great place to go and catch a game though, because if it's televised, they'll be showing it!"}
{"text":"I have never been a huge fan of the food and service here, but with the lack of choices in the immediate area and the absolute NEED for a burger, we ordered takeout.  In the phone, the woman taking my order proceeded to give me a cooking lesson on how my rare burger might not be so rare when I get it home due to the cooking process. Are you kidding? I've cooked a few things in my day.  So, I arrive to pick up my order. I get a one-finger gesture over to the bar, where to-go orders are procesed. What a joke. There are a few dozen post-work drinkers in there, so I am promptly ignored for a while. One may think it easier to pick up at the hostess stand? There I go thinking again!  I then pay for my order with whom I can only assume is a manager. I then ask if I can have a few ranch. He passes the request to the bartender.  My name is called after a few awkward minutes trying to find a less intrusive place to stand. As I get my bag, I verbally verify that there are a few ranch in the bag. She says there are. Stupid me for not looking. Get home: nothing.  Beyond aggravated.  The burger was ok. The mozzarella sticks were excellent. Would have been better with ranch. Doh. A side salad of just lettuce cost an extra $1.75. Ridiculous. Not a pleasant experience. I don't know why I expected better.  Update this morning: GM Debbie contacted me for a follow-up, which was nice to see that they care about bettering customer service. She advised me that they are now looking in to better ways to complete the take-out orders. Thanks Debbie."}
{"text":"Oh Native, how you disappoint!  Let me count the ways.  One, dirty plates. Two, a bit of attitude from the waiter. Three, the wings were not as good as past times as they were cold and lacking in sauce.   I will come here again once my cravings for wings comes back. Hopefully next time they will be on their game."}
{"text":"Liked the layout inside, waitress was awesome and friendly...liked to joke around.  Wings were pretty disappointing...they are heavily dressed with sauce and a bit undercooked.  I'd go back to request those two changes and see how they come out cuz I did like the taste of the sauce and they were meaty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go!  Best traditional wings ever!  So meaty!  The bartenders and waitstaff are awesome as well!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've had a very good burger here but the fries were under cooked. The service on the other hand was horrible! It took a party of 3 (2 adults and a child) 25 mins of seated time before we even got water to our table. Asked my waiter for a 3rd set of silverware and never got it so I had to stop the manager as I saw her walking past the table with a few in her hand for one. Proceeded to tell her that we were not happy that it to over 20 mins to get water and we still did not have the appetizer and that I have a child that is starving and begging me for food as Im talking to her the appetizer hits the table. 2 mins later still talking to her and the food hits the table. All she told me was that they were having high turnover in staff and that it was very busy and if I would have sat in the bar area the better servers are in that area. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I should be able to sit anywhere in a restaurant and get good service!! Been to the STV location twice and same horrible service both times. My parents have also been there once and had the same complaint. Sorry manager that gave me a line of crap but I don't think its \"busy\" I think your waiters suck. Get better staff if you want to keep your regulars! Management brushes off complaints here and refuses to take responsibility! This location is much closer to my house but I would recommend the Power Rd & Chandler Heights location as far as service."}
{"text":"Have to say .. Definitely improving! Came in a little under two years ago with my boyfriend, kids and some friends and were barely acknowledged by the hostess let alone completely ignored by 3 staff members in a nearly empty bar.  Hadn't come back in since, but decided to give the place another shot since we were in the area.  Food was great and Travis took great care of us!  On top of things, friendly, efficient, and attentive in a pretty busy crowd.  Thanks again Travis for rebounding us back to your establishment when we are on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit across the street waiting on my food at Toms BBQ. I called Native to order dinner and asked if they had any specials. The girl asked if it was for carry out or eat in. I said carry out, after waiting on hold for a couple minutes she came back and said wings were on special for .55 each. I said ok I will take 20. Then she tells me that is only available for dine in. REALLY?  I told her it was a carry out order in the first place. Your restaurant is only as good as the help you hire and train ...perhaps you should train them a little better."}
{"text":"Update below:  I'll give this chain some props. Their *strippers* are excellent. Really, really done well. Sauces are good too. As for the wings, bla, ordinary and average. The extra star is for the specials. Good value and HH has legit HH specials. This place by my new house is gonna see me quite often.   Update: jus bad service!!!!! Came in on a Thursday so I can watch a game. I had to remind the bartender to change the channel that I requested. Then after a while I asked to sample some wing sauce..... I was completely forgotten again by the bar. 6-7 tabs is ALL SHE HAD. The rest of the place was ok so no excuse to be forgotten about twice. Seriously!!!!! If you can't handle 6-7 you shouldn't be at the bar....."}
{"text":"We came in for some appetizers before the ASU game, and sat at the bar. Our bartender was a really cool guy named Obey. He took great care of us! He made sure that the tvs were on the games we wanted to watch.  At one point the manager tried to change the channel from the game we were watching, and we were going to leave because of it. Obey saw that and apologized, and made sure that we got the game back on the tv we were watching. He was just great!!"}
{"text":"Let's just leave this here: Don't tell your customers that the meal comes with three sliders when it actually comes with 2 and charge extra for the third slider thinking they won't notice. Very cheap move on the part of the waitress to try and raise the check. I've been a server before, so I always tip 20%, even with this bad service. So word of advice to the waiters here: don't charge your customers for something you very clearly word as \"that comes with three sliders. What side do you want\" in very immature attempts to raise the check price and earn more. Way to steal money from your customers."}
{"text":"I really don't know why we keep subjecting ourselves to this place. There's an issue EVERY SINGLE TIME we try to eat here. From order mixups, to forgotten items, rude hostesses, waits for no reason and today was no different. Today, a Sunday, we came in for a late lunch because we wanted a patio to sit on to enjoy the weather. There are 12 tables on the patio, two were occupied and we were put on a waiting list. After waiting for 5 minutes, my husband pointed the empty tables out to the hostess and she said \"we're not waiting for a table. We're waiting for a server\", quite rudely, and went back about her business. My husband asked if we could at least be seated so we could look at the menu and figure out what we wanted to eat. She said \"go ahead\". Didn't take us out, didn't give us a menu, couldn't be bothered to provide even an ounce of customer service. We walked ourselves out and sat ourselves. No menus. After about 5 minutes, my husband went in to the bar to order a drink and ask for a menu. He mentioned that we hadn't seen a waitress and the bartender was gracious enough to wait on us. She is the only reason this isn't a one star review. All total from the time we walked in until we ordered our food, 34 minutes and only because we basically had to serve ourselves. I just don't understand how this Native is still in business. I've got to remember not to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm leaving this one star because I'm very disappointed the service I had tonight. Normal my boyfriend and I come in every Monday and it's usually AMAZING !!!! We usually get Pete or Whitney, and they're just amazing at there job and we always come back for them. Every now and then we get someone else and they usually do a great job however tonight was not the case. Amy was by far the worst experience I've had here.  First off she didn't get our drinks, that's understandable because they were packed at first. Then after awhile she took our order and everything was going okay. We had complications with our drink order but the Bar tender was awesome and we came and talked to us and we got everything straightened out. It then took forever to get the food. She never came and checked on us, some other guy brought us refills and checked on us at the end. Then when she came to give us our check she was really rude about it, and then we gave her our code and then she came back and dropped it on our table no words. At this point the restaurant wasn't busy at all  so there was no need for that, to be honest she was kind of being a real bitch about everything. Will I be returning ? I'm not sure, it's very disappointing at the fact that one person can ruin something great."}
{"text":"The best place if your a local! Sarah or Serah however you spell it it's pronounced the same! She's awesome! Even though she made me watch golf on super bowl .....JK! They made me feel like I was at home and their an extended family! Great place cheers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for Thursday night strippers it was very good and fast service not to mention the staff is always very kind at this location."}
{"text":"The service while not the quickest (especially when you're the only table sitting in the dining room) is pretty slow but their friendliness makes up for it. We got a pizza/salad deal and we really enjoyed the pizza, especially the crust. The salad was meh. The lettuce leaves were already turning a different color so we had to work around that. My husband also got the wings and said they were pretty good but he would have liked them a bit saucier."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings, but the beer selection is trapped in the 90's (or maybe the 80's).  In an era where you can get a serviceable IPA in any generic chain restaurant in town, this place is relentlessly hop-free.  For the love of god, it's time for a change. The Four Peaks truck is already dropping off Kilt Lifter...how about adding Hop Knot. Or Odell IPA, Stone IPA, or even just Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Updating to three stars because now they have Hop Knot on tap!"}
{"text":"The wings are jumbo, for real jumbo, and they're currently on special at 35 cents each which is pretty cheap/ They also taste good. I like. the problem was (mostly) the service. Brandon was the server, and he was pretty terrible.  We had the potato skins to start. They had all the appropriate toppings, but there was way too little of the toppings on the skins. There was cheese. There was bacon. There was other stuff. There wasn't much of any of it. Bummer.  I ordered a coke. The person I was with ordered a rum and coke. At this point, Brandon asked if she had meant a Jack Daniels and coke. He seemed completely flummoxed when we explained that Jack Daniels is not rum. Bacardi, for example, is indeed rum. When the drinks came, the soda was flat. Brandon immediately replaced mine upon my mentioning the flatness of the soda, but didn't do anything with the mixed drink.  Mt wings came. It was supposed to be 6 medium (sort of a standard buffalo wing sauce) and 6 pineapple teriyaki. The medium actually came as mild. There was no discernable sauce on the medium wings. The manager was called over, and she fixed my sauceless wings, the overcooked french fries of my dining partner, and my dining partner's drink.  Job well done.   Overall, this was a 1 star experoemce. I gave it 2 because the manager was great,"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot for wings even though they're pricey compared to places like long wongs. Visited here last sunday night with my family and there was maybe a few tables being used and it seemed to be a slow night, figured thats good we will get our food quickly and the service should be great. It was quite the opposite, our wings seemed to be just throw on the platter they serve them on and bathed with cold sauce. The fries were so over done they were like hollow potato straws. To top it all off our server had checked on us once maybe twice during our dinner leaving us with no refills or napkins for the majority of the time. Will not return sorry!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night since we just moved into mesa ( we love native new yorker ) .. we ordered some wings, and a few beers. Server was slow bringing us the beers , the second round sat up there for about 4 minutes before the server caught us staring at them and she realized she still hadn't brought it over to us. The wings finally came out and I have never seen wings come out like this before . They were way over cooked , like as if they Re-dropped them into the fryer. ( our food took a long time to come out as well.) We didn't send the wings back as we had already waited long enough , but the service was not great, and the food was not acceptable. We still love Native New Yorker , but we will return back to the One located In Tempe !"}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen BBQ wings, when I got home there was little to no sauce on them. I drove all the way back (36 weeks pregnant) and they had an excuse that 'that's how they make them.' I've had wings there before and it's hit or miss. They either don't put any sauce or they do. Definitely never going back. If I'm paying for wings I expect sauce and not just fried chicken with a dab of sauce."}
{"text":"Not the best native, but it isn't bad.  They have a nice sized menu and a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here for lunch today. During lunch, the main dining room is usually closed and the bar area is open. I was a little discouraged at first, because of seating, but there were plenty of booths, tables and the bar to sit. We ordered some wings and a burger. The waitress was very attentive, the wings came out fast. The wings were very good. I recommend the strawberry hot wings. And if you just want to try a few wings, they sell them individually! The burger was also cooked perfectly. My hubby and I split the burger and a dozen wings. They even split the burger and divided it on two plates. I would highly recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I decided to come back since hubby wanted wings. The food and service was much better! However, the ladies bathroom was beyond disgusting! We arrived at 5pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't like a busy night. Very very dirty floors, unflushed toilets, over flowing trash in all stalls, NO toilet paper!!! When I told the bar tender she just said \"oh, ok\".... Like she didn't care... I bet it's still not clean....."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've gone here I must be stupid and this time I ordered the pizza it's the worst pizza I have ever had in my lifetime it taste like sawdust"}
{"text":"Great variety of wing flavors. Fun sports bar atmosphere. Covered outdoor seating area with TVs. Close to ASU and seems to be popular with the students. Staff is friendly and helpful. The bartenders were great. Good at recommending drink options. Carry out was convenient and quick. A great place to eat some wings and watch the game."}
{"text":"I'm mad yelp doesnt give the option for 1/2 a star. My niece ordered a calzone and it was raw. Had the server take it back and ordered something different off the menu & it took more than 25 minutes. Then she ordered a Parmesan chicken sandwich with onion rings and they brought it out with fries. Then the GM comes and is rude about the situation. I wouldn't recommend this natives to anyone. The people are rude and the their cooks are amateurs."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this was one of the worst meals I have eaten in a long time.  My boyfriend suggested a particular local sit-down pizza joint, so I drove to where I thought I'd seen it located, but it turned out to be Native New Yorker instead. We were hungry so we decided to give it a whirl anyway.  My boyfriend is not hard to please when it comes to pizza, he's a standard pepperoni kinda guy. He ordered a 10\" pepperoni pizza, which looked like your average pizza, no frills. After the first bite, he gave a thumbs down and made a sad face. All this, coming from a man who regularly eats junky chain pizzas without complaint. He said the crust was bland, the sauce didn't taste like much and it was waaaay greasy. I tried some myself and it was truly awful pizza.  I ordered the Linebacker sandwich (turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella, avocado) which sounded promising and looked quite good as well. The turkey was standard shaved deli counter meat with little flavor, the lettuce and tomato was fine, the bacon added some much needed salt to the sandwiched , and the avocado was very unripe, thus flavorless. The only saving grace of the sandwich that made it palatable was the bread roll which had a decent crust on it. For my side, I opted for their \"house-made chips\". They looked awesome, a good golden brown and sliced very thin lengthwise. Sadly, they were served completely cold and undersalted. Some were pretty floppy and undercooked. I know they're potato chips, but was I wrong in assuming that they might have been fried to order and served hot?  The more I think about this meal, the more upset I get. While the price for our meal wasn't outrageous, the food was still amazingly mediocre. I don't like knowing I could have gone to the Safeway and bought a pre-made deli turkey sandwich for $3.99 that would have been basically just as tasty as something I paid more than double for. I've noticed that many reviews mention the chicken wings as being especially good, but I don't know if I'll give them another chance so I could find out."}
{"text":"Wings were great and so were the mozzarella sticks. Our waiter was phenomenal his name was Brian. I am very impressed at the serves he gave I really felt valued. Will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience will never go back there again. Our food took way to long to come out apparently the food was out for a long time but our server Emily was enjoying her lunch and didn't worry about getting ours. Pizza was uncooked, wings were cold, salad was ok. It followed with me dropping my drink on me and she laughed at me walked away came back laughing and didn't even offer me another drink. So check your costumer service and professionalism before giving somebody a job"}
{"text":"I would have to say that overall, it was just OK. I got the fish and fries. The fish was really oily, and the longer it set on my plate the soggier it got. The twisted potato appetizer was really good. My husband ordered some chicken wings with the buffalo sauce. For 79 cents apiece, they were really small chicken wings. My husband made a comment that they must be from cornish hens. Our meal total with drinks was $33. The service was good."}
{"text":"This place is seriously terrible. I have been here twice now because we have had Groupon and the second time has been just as bad. They don't give us refill, they get our order wrong on at least one of our items that we ordered.  No one checks on us and their customer service is terrible. They're so many employees just standing around. Just save your money."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Denise, the general manager is amazing. This place has great service and great food specials. My family loves coming here. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, if I could rate it 0 stars I would. Sat in booth for 30 minutes after ordering without having a server come up to us once. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Anyone who says these wings suck is not doing it right. Just get traditional wings and own it, because let's face it- you rock it girlfriend!"}
{"text":"Wished they would allow no stars.  This was perhaps the worst experience ever at a native. It took 15 minutes to get anyone to serve us then when we did get to order it was another 20 minutes to bring drinks.  We did order wings and an appetizer, requested appetizer be brought out before, that did not happen and when came with meal it was not warm.  The wings were only warm and dry we had ordered hot and there was very little sauce.  When we requested more of the sauce that was an up charge,  at the price of wings you would think that would not be the case.  I also do not understand the reasoning of never seeing same server, one takes drink order another brings drinks someone else takes food order then someone else brings food.  Each person you ask for something,ketchup, napkins, silverware , you never get it.  We had to go and get our on silverware, ketchup and napkins.   We will never return to Native again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday around 4:00, it wasn't very busy.  I sat outside on the patio, the service was okay, the pizza was very good.  My complaint is this, the place was filthy!  Every table outside was dirty, and only one table was occupied.  It smelled of stale beer and cigarettes and the flies were so bad I actually had one land in my beer glass, so much for that beer!  I literally had to cover my pizza and my new glass of beer with napkins so that the flies wouldn't ruin my meal.  This is the time of year us \"zonies\" like to sit out and enjoy the outdoors.  If they would CLEAN the patio, it would probably solve the fly problem and make for a much nicer outdoors experience.  Until then, I will find someplace else to go, there are a lot of options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I met up with some buddies here and the service was non-existent , it took the server 20 minutes from the time I took a seat to get my drink order another 15 minutes to take my food order. I think it took her this long because she was chatting away with other employees and ignoring my friends and I. After eating the chard wings we waited 45 minutes for the check I got fed up and it took the manager to give us a refill on our drinks. We were there for 2.5 hours most of the time was waiting for the server to get our orders and to give us the check. Horrible service horrible food , I suggest you go elsewhere I will never eat here again ."}
{"text":"Where to start this review? Came in on a Monday afternoon, fairly dead, so to speak. Bartender was no where to be seen and the other servers just ignored the patrons at the bar. Finally, Amanda, the bartender showed up to take my order. I asked for the \"new\" beer & wing combo (Ranger IPA & 6 wings). Got the beer immediately. 10 minutes later I ordered the \"Native Burger\". Both were served at the same time. When I asked the manager, who delivered my meal, about getting them at the same time instead of as ordered, she told me \"that's not the way they were rung in\" and she placed my food down and walked off. I guess I get to decide which portion to eat hot and which to eat cold. As the afternoon progressed, Amanda got better and finally explained the days drink specials.  Food was great, service was better than average and management was totally lacking. I've been coming here for a few years and will continue to return but, management really needs some \"people skills\" training.   5 stars for food and bartender service, -2 stars for management's unprofessionalism!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 2 years and I always feel like a VIP the moment I walk into the door. These people are like family to me and always take care of me and whoever decides to tag along with me. Service is soooo amazing and prompt that I am literally spoiled here and cannot find service like this anywhere else! This is like the neighborhood \"cheers\" absolutely love it here for drinks and food!!! All the staff is amazing!! Say hello to mike,Garrett,micheal,joy Lori, tony, kristah. My absolute faves!!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday to watch the fights...with our 2 year old daughter. Just want to say that our waitress Mallory was amazing! They were busy, of course, but she was great. Attentive and so good with our daughter. Offered to bring her one of those tablets after awhile to entertain her. Every now and then you just get really good service and this was one of those times. I work in retail so I know it can be stressful but she was really just awesome."}
{"text":"We gave this place a 2nd try and we will never be going back.  The service is horrible and the food is not that great.   It's sad, cause it has the potential of being a really cool neighborhood bar.  I'll spend my money else where."}
{"text":"Food was nasty, burger was dry and French fry's were soggy, that was just some of the food. We were charged twice for our meal. Took the server and manager 3 try's to get the bill changed. The manager actually asked me if I wanted to fight all the servers because one of the male servers was staring at me like a watch dog that wanted to fight when I went outside to wait for the manager to figure out her \"computer\" malfunction. \"Just call corporate if you have a problem\" is what I was told by the server that was standing with the manager outside as I was finally paying for our lousy overpriced meal. So that is what I will do, and I will be sure to mention that the manager asked, \"what are you going to fight all the servers?\" Professional management skills shined through as she told that same male who was obviously watching me as if I would bail on a measly $60 check to just go away like she was his mom! Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely amazing! The staff always does the best they can. The manager walks around and talks to everyone and helps the servers. The host's are awesome. I always feel welcome and greeted. Everyone is super nice and I'd come back 5000000000 more times"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. We were seated quickly which I liked. The atmosphere was family friendly sports bar. There are multiple tvs with sports on. I like how the bar  and dining area are separate.  We ordered 1/2 doz honey hot and 1/2 doz strawberry hot. Wings came out hot but lacked in flavor. I didn't really feel like there was any heat. I couldn't tell which wings were which.  The kids meals for my son was a good portion for the price and the fruit bowl it came with was very fresh!  Zucchini appetizer was my favorite! Not soggy and had a jalapeño ranch with a nice kick. The service was excellent! Very prompt and the server (I think her name was Madison) was attentive.   If you're ordering wings, ask for a rub or sauce on the side for extra flavor. I tried asiago cheese and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"To begin with, I always read reviews before going to any restaurant. After reading how this establishment hasn't gotten any better in their customer service in better than a year tells you immediately to STAY AWAY. Enough said."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to have dinner, ordered the meatball sub.  My meal comes out and it only has the bottom half of the sub roll... I ask the bartender / server and she says yeah, I know, I have told them the same thing! Few minutes later some another employee (Nate,, Mgr.) comes over and asks of there's a problem,,, I explain to him that I'm missing half my sandwich, hold it up with both hands for him to see, it flops all over the place and I tell him this is not what was advertised, not a \"sub\"!!!  He did offer to bring me more bread,,, I'm assuming the other half of the sub roll and I decline.  I said no, you can just pay for my drink (cocktail), he rufuses, gets angry at me, grabs my plate from in front of me and tells me that I must leave!  I laugh and continues to insist I leave!  I finished the meatball that I had in my hand and left! Nate,,, was extremely rude, inconsiderate, and a moron! I'll never go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm never typically in Gilbert, but decided to stop in for chicken strippers and a beer. I'm so glad I decided to sit at the bar because there was a wait for a booth. I had Shae as my server/bartender, and she was out of this world!! She helped me decided on which flavor sauce to pair with my chicken strippers. She was very attentive, and super kind even though she seemed very busy. She never left my glass looking empty and got me out my delicious food while it was piping hot!! Definitely will be back again. I recommend checking out Shae as your bar tender. She rocks."}
{"text":"4.5 stars would be more accurate for me. My husband and I love this place for its wings and nothing else. We've been here quite a few times since its 5 minutes away from our house and we've always been treated very well by its staff. I love their honey hot wings. It's advertised as \"America's favorite wing sauce\". I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I def can vouch for how yummy they are! I've tried many of their wing sauces and even the mango habanero doesn't come close. The only thing I don't like about the restaurant is that it could be a bit cleaner and provide a more appetizing menu. My son doesn't like any of the items offered for kids. His macaroni and cheese was so dry and tasted like Kraft Mac n cheese that had been sitting out all day. Yuck! But even so, wings are so good, we still love coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them less than one star, WORST service I have ever received somewhere. I am a waitress my self so I know the struggle and how not to be hard on them if it's busy. Well there was only two other tables besides mine. She would just pop her head around the wall and say cool and walk away she would give us refills and she wouldn't bring us our food when it came out we saw it just sitting there for a few minutes and she had other people bring us our food she really didn't do anything. She was playing on her phone when she took our freaking orders for crying out loud. Now the food on the hand was good the pasookie was perfect as always and the wings were alright if they had a little bit more sauce on them (: but I'm not sure I will be back to this particular one only because you could tell the servers didn't want to be there they were unhappy with their guests and we're trying to get rid of them."}
{"text":"We have been going to Native for a long time and have seen them through many changes and have stayed even when they took the puffs off the menu.. then they took antipasto salad off the menu and now the strippers are gone.. the servers have always been awesome and fixing it up for us but this last time the chicken is now different and the ingredients for the salad is different also.. so I don't know if you changed who you get your produce and food from but you need to go back because it sucks now and I won't come back anymore.! I've had enough of your menu changes and saving money it is not helping your food any.. faithful native customers no m"}
{"text":"Primary reason for writing this review is due to the amazing service we had tonight. Or waitress was Candice and she was way more than just an order taker.  We sat at a table in the bar area and Candice noticed we were looking at the cocktail menu. Rather than just waiting for us to order, she smartly suggested her favorites and why.    We ordered drinks and when she delivered then she sincerely stated that she was going to take care of us. That if we need anything we should ask. It was heartfelt. It was fantastic to feel cared for by a restaurant waitress like that.  Our food came and she was right there to check on us. We ordered a dozen each of the traditional hot and the BBQ hot wings. These were so good that we each finished em off.  Candice brought us our bill and that was that. This was the first time I felt like tipping more than the standard 15% in a long time. She got 25% and deserved every penny."}
{"text":"Great service from Tuvarde.  Wings were awesome. Salad and mozzarella sticks were super yummy.  I'll be back.    Came back again.  Wings were the best.  Service this time was slow.   Only one server working."}
{"text":"To make what could be a very long complaint short, food is pretty good, service is absolutely terrible..  The first few times I went (about a year ago), never had problems with the service.  The last few times I've been there, I'm pretty sure we've had the same server each time, and we are always there FOREVER!  She never writes anything down, and is constantly forgetting things.  I've served for years, and know the \"oh shit I forgot to put something in\" look.  Each time it's the same story...20 minutes after ordering beer refills (that we had to flag them down for), she goes to the bartender who promptly starts getting our beers, and then goes to the computer.  It always takes forever to get our food, and I notice that everyone sits and talks for a bit and then go to the computer to put in the order.  Decent food and shitty service seems to be a running theme for this place.  The last 3-4 times we went we've had terrible service (and they've never been busy when we go), and that sucks because it's slim pickings for restaurants in Laveen.  If they hired some decent servers that actually cared, I might start going there again"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times, but our friends that lived across the street from it just moved so probably won't go back as frequently.    The wings are great, the food is generally good.  I have never had a bad food experience here.    The service depends.  In the dining room, which I rarely use, the service has been pretty good.  In the bar, which is usually where I am sitting, the service is almost always slow.  But as I have said in other reviews, the beer is cold and I have always had a good time here, so that counts for something.   Also, when I say slow service, at least they routinely check on you at that place.  It's not like at Gallaghers on Baseline where they just never even bother to talk to you or stop back by your table after the first interaction.  Cold, affordable beer + a good time + decent food + slow service = 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Pretty boring inside and out, looks like a doctors office. The food is ok but every time I go it takes forever to come out. The wings are very small but good. Go here if you're into paying regular price for very small wings that look like they came from a bat or a bird not a chicken."}
{"text":"Ah, Native New Yorker, how I miss you! We don't have these in Spokane, WA (yet!) so I make it a point to stop by whenever I visit my friends in Phoenix. I know, I know - it is now Native Grill and Wings. Except we die hard fans will always remember the New Yorker.  The Native location I have visited the most is on Mesa Drive and Brown, with Gilbert Rd and the 60 being a close second, so I will focus on those. I prefer the restaurant on Brown and the bar on Gilbert.  For a dining experience, the Native is great for bar food: I have always loved their wings above all other wings I have tried. When they are on, they are the best. Another favorite of mine is the Garbage Pizza, which is aptly named, since it has a little bit of everything on it (including banana peppers!). The first time I tried it I was skeptical, but it is one of my favorite menu items. The homemade potato chips are also a great alternative to French fries.  As for the bar, I love the Gilbert location, because the bar is huge. There are one top tables and 8 seaters, and everything in between. The draft beers are cold, the wings are hot, and (last I knew) Friday and Saturday nights feature some great karaoke.  If you love wings and have somehow not been to the Native, do yourself a favor and drop by, on a Tuesday if you can arrange it. That is the day they have their best wing special.  If this restaurant ever opens a Spokane location, I will become a regular patron almost immediately. Until then, I will have my cherished memories."}
{"text":"I moved across the street from this location back in May/2017 and always had mediocre service until tonight! Tonight I came in for a take out order and Austin was soooooo SO AWESOME! My wings are always perfect and his customer service made everything THAT much better!!!! I'm looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Richard's review.  Also, Junk should try visiting New York instead of just stereotyping based on a select few.  My boyfriend and I walked into this place thinking it might help us transition a little easier to living in the southwest, as we've just moved here from New York City.  I'm originally from the Midwest, so I have no qualms about New York attitudes and food and J is very open to trying everything.  At first glance, it seems like it might be a nice place, though it is very dark, almost like a dive bar with no windows.  The hostess didn't immediately recognize us as customers as she was playing with her cell phone, so J tried to get her attention with a joke about native New Yorkers (the people, not the restaurant).  Her response was a hazy glance and a slow \"what?\" as she attempted to half-smile her way out of the situation.    Eventually we were seated in a room that looked like it was still waiting for decoration, lights, and maybe some barriers.  It was literally one big square room with about 20-30 tables strewn about and tiny uncomfortable booths lining the mostly windowless walls.  The kitchen opened into this one room via one of the corners, luckily we were seated across the room from it, though there didn't appear to be much going on.  We were there for lunch, though only about 3 other couples and a family with a horde of obnoxious screaming children were present for the meal, or lack thereof.  I immediately took note of the small portion sizes and the greasy sheen over everything, including the tables and seats.    By the time we got our menus, which were also dripping wet from just having been wiped down with a greasy rag, we weren't hungry.  The food on the menu is bland, boring all-American bar food:  plain old burgers, french fries, and finger food.  This isn't to say they didn't have spaghetti, BLTs and flash-fried fish, but I barely got past the first half of the menu before it slid out of my hand.  We didn't stay for food once our drinks (water, as we were never asked what we wanted to drink) arrived.  It was probably a one-time thing, but my water had bits of something floating in it, and it wasn't lemon.    Needless to say, I can't say anything about the food, but the service was completely lacking.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of dining in a greasy basement."}
{"text":"Giving this location one star is being generous. The food was mediocre. The service was absolutely terrible and the manager was no better than the waiter. I will never eat at this location again. UPDATE: We gave this restaurant a second chance and the experience was completely amazing in comparison to the last visit. The waitress was new and she was amazing. The owner was so kind and you can tell he genuinely cares about his customers. The food was also much better this time."}
{"text":"Apparently it's too difficult to order a hangover burger and have them cook the egg over medium. \"Quality control\" was their reason. I think it's their \"cooks\" can't understand how to leave an egg on the grill 30 second longer. Horrible customer service. This is on top of waiting 30 minutes to order and another 30 Minutes for food. Do NOT eat here."}
{"text":"It was good the service wasn't bad at all   Great atmosphere to hang out with friends and family"}
{"text":"This is not about the food. We went there on a Sunday afternoon for my b'day. I saw Family Feud on one TV and asked for the bar trivia game to be put on there. I don't care for football, just wanted some entertainment for me. The waiter came back and said the manager said only sports allowed  and then Family Feud went off right then. I said at least 16 TV's had football on them, most all the same games. Could I not entertain myself? and my friend?  It's my birthday? I know this sounds petty, but we have been going there for 15 years. ????"}
{"text":"Nothin great, ur typical bar n grill... Not much of a fan of native just came to meet a few friends here to watch the finals. I will say staff is friendly and they keep the place clean."}
{"text":"I ate outside the box and did not get the wings! We had the tidbit platter with fried everything and it all pretty much tasted the same no flavor. Unless you dipped in a sauce.   I also ordered the burger and it looked disgusting! Why was my burger grey? What the hell is that about? I ordered med well and this did not look anything like beef gross! I sent it back and nibbled on my dates fish which was OK nothing to write home about.   All and All it was a big disappointment, I wont be back. Date said wings were good I'll take his word for it."}
{"text":"I know it's not typical. But if you go at non-peak times this place is great. It's a little pricey, I give you that. But the wings are awesome. Family likes the pizza, especially the spicy one and I love the Cobb. The beef Kumelweck is great and so are the burgers. Just happy this is a neighborhood joint! Service can be hit or miss BUT on non-peak hours it's fine. You can tell they're really trying too, to compensate. I'll be back. Hopefully I remember to start checking in!"}
{"text":"Good service. I always get medium traditional wings and Cobb salad. Both have changed a little recently but are still delicious. Feels like all locations could be a little cleaner. But they're always hoppin'. I think the pizza is ok. He knock is it's pretty pricey for what you get. I'll be back for the cobb and wings."}
{"text":"After my prior review the GM of this location reached out to me expressing his concerns regarding my visit and offered for me to come back in with a Gift-card on the house.  I was happy to see that he was not making excuses and simply apologizing, he did both; however, he mainly focused on his care for a customer's experience.  From working in the hospitality industry in the past, I follow the same beliefs in that it is important to show care and concern, not simply make excuses and turn your head.    I went back this past weekend and received excellent service (the service I remembered in the past).  I was sure to not mention who I was until it came time to get the bill, as I didn't want to receive special treatment and leave a biased review.    I now know that my prior bad experience was a one-off for this location, and when it came time to pay and I explained the situation, the manager we saw on the prior visit said hello and made her rounds.  Unfortunately the GM that followed up prior was off that evening, but I definitely plan to be back again.  PS - regarding the food.  The wings were crispy and tasty, the burger was perfect, and the beer was ice cold :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for lunch. We have always enjoyed the Native New Yorker, although the name has changed, the food, service and ambience has not. We were greeted right away upon entering, seated and greeted by our waiter. He promptly took our drink orders and quickly returned. I ordered the native burger with fries as my side. I thought the burger was cooked perfectly(I ordered it medium well), it has gooey american cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. They have ketchup and mustard in squeeze bottles so you put your own on. In my opinion the fries were soggy. I tried a couple of my husband's onion rings and thought they were awesome! Very crispy! The service was good, the food was good, and I will for sure be back to try more yummy items."}
{"text":"Where to begin.... I had some pizza bites or something like that. They're like Totinos Pizza Bites, but when you bite these, bright orange grease spews out the back side and burns your hand. Avoid them! I found the restaurant side uncomfortable; there aren't any booths where you can see the TVs from. With the noise level and the inexperienced waitresses, a TV view is necessary.  Places like this would never make it outside of Phoenix, but there are so few options in Laveen, this is one of the only sports bars in that area worth going to.  One saving grace; the beer selection at the bar is fair. The draft prices are okay. The wings aren't as flavorful as I had hoped - or as hot as they scare you into believing - but they are cooked good and have good texture. There are a lot of TVs but it seems like they're hard to see wherever you sit. The crowd is good, and they have trivia game machines and weekly poker tourneys. All in all, it's decent."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings! They probably have some other stuff too but it isn't any good. And the place was significantly better before the renovation... it used to look like a sports bar that served delicious wings, now it looks like a family restaurant that bought out a TV repair shop and thinks it has a full menu but only really does wings well. But hey, wings!"}
{"text":"Andrew was awesome, attentive, and provided excellent customer service. Thank you for your attention to detail and your personal touch."}
{"text":"Took my son to Native grill and wings for his first time today. It was nice that it wasn't busy for lunch today, and one would think that the service from ordering our food to actually receiveing it would be reasonable shorter than the hour it took to get 2 burgers. Come on Native, really, an hour for 2 burgers? And, my order was not correct as I asked for a lettuce wrapped burger and it was delivered on a bun. The egg was overcooked, the dinner salad I paid extra for in place of fries, had so many tomatoes and shredded cheese it made it unpalatable.   As for the service...our person I'm sure is a nice guy, but doesn't active listen otherwise my order would have come out correct. What a shame, this place has gone down hill so much that I/we will never be back. If there was an option to rate a zero, I would have provided that as the score. Now we sit, with finished dishes on our table waiting to be cleared and for our bill, well after the last check in to see if we wanted dessert. Is it really difficult to carry two tables bills at one time? The table that was seated after us, have already ate, paid and left. Wow!   Oh wait, our server just stopped by to ask if we wanted to hang out for a while or get our tab...um, check please! We have to leave and cannot sit here all day, thanks Aaron and bye-bye."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed. A friend and I were recommended this place because it has fast wifi. We went there to do homework and write, and let the server know we would be there for a while, hoping they could put us in the back and out of the way.   They put us right in the front. No problem, it wasn't very busy, right? Wrong. Even though there were PLENTY of areas to sit for incoming guests (not sure why there were any incoming guests, this place is awful), we could hear all of the front of house staff standing around the host stand blatantly bad mouthing us and complaining that we were there too long.   The thing that most upsets me is WHY offer free wifi if you are going to bash people who use it! Furthermore, once confronted, the server then came back and lied when we had CLEARLY heard her.   Don't bother going here. The food is decent (I really loved the mozzarella sticks) but the service is horrible and unacceptable. I'm sad that I'll never go back because those mozzarella sticks were amazing! Get it together Native New Yorker!"}
{"text":"Foòd is ok, atmosphere is nice, but this place would be nothing without Paige. She provides great service and is fun!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 2:10 pm on a Sunday for a late lunch. The restaurant was empty besides 2 tables . There was apparently only 1 (ONE) waitress on staff?!! We waited 5 min to be seated as there was no greeter . We were told by the waitress to sit wherever . The restaurant was filthy! I felt terrible for the waitress she was working her booty off running the restaurant . We waited nearly 40 min before we got our food (which was great ) I had the chicken sandwich and Fries . My bf had chicken wings and an order of fries . The only waitress in the building was so great ! And the food was very tasty . I gave it 3 stars for the food , but we won't be back .. There are way too many choices out there to waste your money on a poorly ran restaurant ."}
{"text":"My fiance and I come here often to play buzztime trivia since it is right down the street from our house. The food is hit or miss. Not very consistent and nothing to write home about. The turkey in the rye sandwich is pretty good and I would probably only recommend getting one of the sandwiches, wings and/or beer at this location. The burgers and apps can be very iffy. The service along with the food is very hit or miss. The last time we ate here two days ago it took at least ten minutes until anyone noticed or greeted us and we sat in one of the main booths in the bar area which wasn't very busy. Once we were greeted service was decent this time. A couple of times we have been here we have gotten a very ditzy waitress who forgets everything the second she takes the order and never comes to check on the table until after you are finished with everything or no longer need what you needed her for in the first place. On the other hand the manager Andrew is very nice and he goes out of his way to make sure his guests are happy. Any time he is working we have a much better experience. We will probably still go back to this Native because it is one of our favorite places to go to play trivia however we have learned at this point what to order and what not to order as well as the service may not always be top notch. I would recommend to this restaurant to be more consistent with your service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker has always been just okay for me. I have been to this location only once before and it was not bad. Tonight was not bad but not great. I usually come here for one reason only, to play buzztime trivia with friends and family. I had a burger just a plain cheeseburger with American cheese cooked medium well. It was okay. The curly fries were quite good. I had a blue moon beer with shot of peach schnapps, delicious. The service was not bad. I informed the hostess that we wanted to play trivia when we were first seated and she turned a TV to it right away. The TV was changed in the middle of a game but it was quickly resolved and changed back.  All in all it was an okay visit. The food is nothing to write home about. It is not a place that I would go out of my way to visit but the beer and apps are pretty good. I might be back to play trivia and or watch football at a later date."}
{"text":"So happy that it's native Grill Wings again . Sure misses this place. The food was really good. Our waiter EDWARD is awesome !!! He was on top of everything very knowable abut the menu . Also very kind guy !"}
{"text":"I love that you can order one wing at a time so you can try all the flavors.  Also the waitstaff was incredibly friendly (in a normal, natural way.)  My visit made me very happy."}
{"text":"Not very accommodating for larger parties. I had a party of 7 and was advised that the area where the tables were at was closed and we could take a seat at the booths. Their booths are extremely close there is no way a 9 month pregnant person could even try to fit in. This was around noon. Needless to say we had to go down the street to another establishment where they were more than happy to accommodate our party of 7"}
{"text":"We really love our waitress at this restaurant, Vee, she is knowledgeable about the food there, kind, and very efficient, She used to just run out the food, but now is a huge asset to NNY! She is a great waitress there! The wings are the best there! We come here at least 2-3 times a month..We also have had over the last few years, Elysa/Tate they are excellent also! Keep up the great work....can't beat great prices, excellent food, and wonderful service! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Wings were good ordered 'naked' but don't know if it was an off day for wings,  but they were very tiny.  The first time they were large meaty wings that were well worth the $1 a piece.   This time they were pathetic.  Kinda like when a place has a wing special for 10 or 50 cent wings and they sub  the good ones with the real tiny ones.  They were maybe 2 inches long with a tiny amount of meat.  Will give it one more try just to see if it was a mistake."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place was clean. Speed of food was good. Staff was ok, not rude but not friendly. I had the pizza and it was amazing. I'll be back but hope for friendly staff"}
{"text":"The food wasn't the best I've ever had, but the service was. Our server, Nadya, took care of us. Our drinks were filled before we had to ask, she interacted with our kids, our order was correct & the food came out fast & hot. We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Will never go back.  I tried this place twice since it's close to home but I won't be going back.  The service was absolutely horrible,  the bar was dirty, and the food was terrible.  The most frustrating part was the horrible service - I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume maybe they had a bad day but there is no reason that I should be treated like a complete inconvenience. My husband also has terrible stomach pains since leaving there and he may have food poisoning.... don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"no no no no no. I am a native NYer myself and this pizza is god-awful. Not sure what they are thinking. I know they are known for their wings, but come ON...that pizza is so bad. One star for the fried zucchini, one star for being able to watch every Yankee game close to home. I cannot speak for the entrees but please I beg you do not order their pizza. It is reminiscent of friggin Domino's or some other fast food garbage. If you are dying for pizza go across the bridge to NYPD, at least the pizza there is edible!"}
{"text":"VISIT Tuesday dinner service, main dining room  FOOD On par with other NNY locations. Not great, but not bad. Although, my 7yo made a point to compliment the server on how much she liked the pretzel rolls on her sliders.  SERVICE Friendly, but PAINFULLY slow. We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware. It took about 20 minutes between the time I said we were done and the time I got the bill, after reminding her once in-between. What should have been a 1 hour visit, easily turned into 2.  DECOR In a word: depressing. I felt like I was sitting in my great grandmother's barn. It's just one, big, drab, loud, bright, dingy room. There were a couple pictures of New York on the wall, and some TVs. Otherwise, we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria.  I will probably never go again -- not with the number of other great choices in the area."}
{"text":"Just picked up our order of 48 hot wings well done to go.  Got home and our order was 48 breaded cold soggy hot wings.  Called to inform them of their mistake and no one would answer the phone.  Must have been too close to closing time.

{"text":"My family and I love to eat at Native! Tonight the food was great and the service was amazing, Lindsay was our server, she was super attentive and very personable! Excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"The wings are good but the burgers we ordered were too small for the price range. The burger was very forgettable. Also the waiter was nice but took to long to attend us and was not attentive."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. Don't make a special trip. Oh and be aware, they automatically add a tip to your bill if you have 6 people. It is not posted anywhere this is the policy."}
{"text":"Ordered wings salt and vinegar dry rub and they tasted like plain chicken wings. We ordered a side of fries... $5!!!! Never again, I would rather drive to Mesa and go to the HUB for some real chicken wings! Service was decent and quick, but food not so good."}
{"text":"I love Native New Yorker generally, but this particular one is terrible.   Every time I visit this store, it's the slowest service ever. Last night I had to wait for over an hour for a plate of chicken strips. The waiter finally showed up with my food and had a good laugh about how the kitchen apparently lost my food ticket.   It's good food, but only if you're willing to wait for it."}
{"text":"Great burgers, tv's everywhere, free WiFi, and some excellent beer choices... Fun place with a chill atmosphere. Serving, host, and busting staff were all nice and helpful. I know this is a chain but still... Great spot"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, wings are tasty my only real issues are when I order my wings extra saucy they should come covered in sauce, not dry as a bone. Same thing with the boneless wings! And my wing has fuzzy bits on it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service for a large party! Some of our softball team families decided to walk over from Springhill Suites for dinner on the recommendation of another customer that stayed at the hotel.  I called to reserve for 26 about 25 minutes prior to when we had decided to go eat. The lady on the phone spoke to the hostess and said they would get everything ready for our group.  They were ready when we arrived. Conner, our waiter, took our orders based on who would be on our tickets - bouncing from one end of the table to the other (the team sat at one end with the parents at the other). He kept our orders straight and the tickets straight. The service was top rated. For all of those other teams that play at the Rose Mofford Sports Complex, this is a great place for a team meal!"}

{"text":"Great place - the wings are awesome - recommend the original style wings in original and honey hot flavors.  Avoid the boneless wings - gross!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a couple of times and after we leave we wonder why we waste our money and our time.  The food is not good at all. The staff are super friendly but the food is gross. We will never be back!"}
{"text":"I had not visited Native Grill since it changed its name. I was a excited to try their new changes, and I am glad I did.   upon walking in i noticed that the place was quite empty, I was relieved with the thought that we might be getting our food quickly due to the place being so empty. I was wrong, since it felt like forever but it may be due to the starving mode I had brought from home.  I first ordered a native long island tea, not too sweet, and it was on the happy hour menu. I enjoyed it, very much.  I ordered their traditional 6 piece bone-in wings with extra mango habanero sauce. They were goooood! They were crispy and saucy, but not saucy enough for me, so i ordered a side of extra sauce and ranch. I devoured my plate in 10 minutes or less and surprisingly it filled me up.   but there was room for desert. I ordered their cookie and ice cream desert. It was soo good but so small and was around $10.. I really liked it, i just wish it was bigger..."}
{"text":"Service was good, Food Fair, price is good. Nothing really caught me and made me say yeah I want to come back here. I can get wings I can get pizza I can get sandwiches at a lot of other places too. Nothing stood out."}
{"text":"My friends and I visit this location very often ; especially on Thursdays (chicken strippers are cheaper). Customer service is decent, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Okay..There was three of us, and waited 30 mins to be seated.  We didn't complain..  It took 15 mins to get our menu.. Waitress just disappeared on us.  So, I had to ask other waitress to get her attention.  15 mins to get our drinks.. At this point, we were gonna leave, but it was getting late and didn't want to go else where.  So, we patiently waited and tried to be understanding, even though place wasn't that busy.  After placing the order, we waited 25 mins or so for our food.. I mean we ordered wings, and it shouldn't take that long..    Well, they screwed up one of the order by giving us something totally different..  And wings were over cooked.. It was too dry!    I asked the waitress, \"Is there a reason why it took so long to get drinks and food?\"  Her answer was, \"We are busy?\"  Really????? REALLY?? Place is not even half full.. I see staff standing around talking.. You consider that busy??  So I was about to call the manager to complain, then one of my friend said.. \"Don't even bother.. We are not coming back here again.. So just let it be\"..    Terrible service, with terrible wings!"}
{"text":"Ever since they renovated the restaurant this has become a great place to go. They opened the whole place up and added a bunch of flat screen TVs, really well done. The food is always good and the service has become better and better, especially when the bartender DJ is around. Great place!  I noticed that it says that they don't have outdoor seating, but they do now."}
{"text":"As an actual upstate Native New Yorker I love this place, we have previously been going to the one in Mesa so were excited when this one opened closer to us. Our service was excellent, our waitress Nicole was super attentive and very sweet! We went on a saturday night, had no wait for a booth, ordered wings & pizza which were excellent and delivered promptly. I have read the negative comments so we waited awhile to visit, as I believe it usually takes some time for a resturant to get things right and I feel this location has accomplished that!"}
{"text":"The strippers there were pretty decent before the renovation, but now they are just terrible. There was barely any sauce on the strippers. I asked for them to be extra crispy and they had no crisp to them. I'm really unimpressed.   As for the renovations, they still haven't figured out how to be a sports bar. It still doesn't feel right.   I used to like this place. After this meal, I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"So it's definitely time to update my review.  We returned after staying clear for awhile and decided to just go with wings.  However, we did go with some tater tots to start off with.  Of course, they were previously frozen but most tots are. They were cooked perfectly and arrived piping hot.  They were also served with ketchup, bbq sauce, and queso. For the wings, we went with the new Chicken N Waffle, Hot Strawberry, Spicy Honey Mustard, and Boneless Medium.  We enjoyed all four flavors...yes, even the Chicken N Waffle Wings.  I'm really glad that we decided to just stick to wings this time around.  There was no disappointment whatsoever.  If this had been my first visit, I probably would've even given four stars, but it's really hard to forget the other visits.  In fact, I'd recommend staying away from the rest of the menu altogether; although there were some sandwiches that could be promising.  At any rate, I'm happy to know that there's a spot nearby where I can enjoy a cold drink, wings, and football."}
{"text":"I agree with the rating as far as the bbq pork flat bread, where's the pork????? Service wasn't badbut wasn't the friendliest! Not that busy had no host at the door but not long wait. But just a very indifferent feel to the place. Glad it's all the way on the other side of Phx from where I live! Only will return with a group if I cannot convince them to go else where!"}
{"text":"Food is random, management scarce it's a so so  place only survives because they offer sports to view while you eat food you could've prepared at home."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker gets a 3 merely because I really like their wings, other than that I could really do without this place in any sort of eating rotation.   Their menu is huge and often leaves you spending time struggling between choices, but there is nothing that spectacular about anything on it. I have tried sandwiches, pizza, pizza puffs, appetizers and all are just OK. It is standard bar fare but without anything special to push it over the edge. The service is hit or miss depending on the day."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday with to meet up with friends. Our bartender was totally on it and was really friendly. I told him to surprise me and make me a great drink, he sure did! I loved them. Would come here again! We didn't have food, so I can't speak to that, but the drinks were on point!"}
{"text":"My friend was like, G, you have to try these wings, they're soooo great. So I did. My friend forgot the first rule of true Buffalo (NY Style ) wings. DO not bread them. These were like KFC wings with sauce on them. And the sauces were nothing to call home about , either. We tried the hot wings. Average. I got some Jalapeno wings, they had no flavor at all, just dry, fried, breaded chicken wings. Also tried their super hot flavors but really, not worth the trip. The place was full of kids and families, screaming and tossing food all over the floor.  To clinch it, the waitress spilled liquid all over my drinks and food and just says \"It's only water\". Well, we weren't drinking anymore, or eating anymore with the dirty serving tray water sprayed all over it. (And my phone as well). Would have tried the old dine and dash in the old days..."}
{"text":"Did a date night here and made sure to get there before happy hour was over (ends at 7). By the time we had gotten our drinks and our server finally came back around to get our order it was 7:01. When I asked for the half off tater tots for the happy hour, he said he couldn't honor it because it was after 7. Really? 1 minute after? We also ordered wings since they do 49 cent wings on Tuesdays. Then we sat and talked for at least 30 minutes before our server came back around questioning why we never got our tater tots. He apologized and a minute later brought out our tots. They comped our tater tots which was nice of them. Wings were good, but sauce was a little heavy and got really sticky and gelatinous as they cooled down. I got the honey hot and probably should have just stuck with the hot wings."}
{"text":"Normally my family and I LOVE Native.  We always get the Native strippers.  However it seems like each time we get them - its worse and worse.  Had dinner there tonight, sons got a pound each and I got a half pound.  They had a total of 8 strippers and I had 5.  The sauce was very little...didnt even coat the strippers.  Very Very DRY!!!   My sons last couple strippers were not cooked all the way. :(  We ended up leaving and decided we are totally done with Native.    Only reason they get 2 stars is because the service was decent and its a nice establishment."}
{"text":"I just don't get this place.  All the food comes straight from Cysco and falls into their fryer and onto your table.  The wings are lukewarm.  The service is bad.  The lighting is terrible.  The place looks dirty.  My wife had the fried fish and shrimp.  The shrimp were tiny and obviously from the frozen section of Costco.  So were the fish.  So were the curly fries (but those are damn good anyway)"}
{"text":"Terrible rip-off.  Fried frozen food really sucks.  The wings were bad too.    (try Blu32 instead  haiku lovers)"}
{"text":"Only complaint.... All the swearing and F-Bombs dropped and this is a public setting not a ratchett bar!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped frequenting Native years ago until I was in Tucson this past month. I stopped by a location near UofA and ordered a dozen traditional hot. It was bomb..really good chicken wings!  I decided to give the local native a chance since the location in Tucson surprised me. I realized after my first wing that I'd made a mistake going there. I ordered 6 hot, and 6 mango habanero. They were dry, overcooked, crispy, bland...they looked like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for a half hour. I asked for a side of extra sauce just to be able to taste what their version of mango habanero was like. It was terrible tasting. Before voicing my disgust, I asked my wife and father who'd also ordered wings, what their take on it was? They both had already formed the exact opinion. I tore and crunched on things after biting into a few more. There were particles cracking in my mouth, I had no idea what they were. I checked my teeth to see if they had broke since the texture was similar to a broken tooth. When the bill arrived, I was charged the extra 59 cents for the mango habanero sauce. I asked the waitress if she could please remove the extra charge, not because of the price, but due to the principal of it all. I learned my lesson, and will never order chicken wings at a native new Yorker again. I don't know how their other food is, but if you're stopping by for chicken wings, you really are doing yourself a disservice. I'd rate them a negative star if I could. One positive aspect, the server we had, and another server were super nice."}
{"text":"Busy day, many parties , one cook and the manager also manning the grills. So the timely service wasn't  happening today. That's ok  wasn't in a hurry.   But the waitress,  Brandi  ,  rocked and kept those things that could be kept in motion moving.  First I have to go off on the wings. I am  tired of promises of impending immolation  or  later cauterization  of hemorrhoids  only to be served up  \"weak sauce\" wings  that are  about as challenging as balancing a brick  in the center of a pool table.   Wing sauce was  also salty as hell.  Wings are a good size and taste good in their own right just  embarrassing that   news of my suicide turned  out to in error.  In this case  for anyone used to hot thai food suicide really is painless   Main course.  Burgers,   Pretty good,  generous on the fries, baked potatoes. Was  good enough   but this is more sustenance than sublime .   Partner  had  tenderloin sliders which were pretty  good meat wise, once you found it , but the buns are way too big for the task and you can't  really enjoy it as a burger but   hopefully someone just mismatched the bread types today.  If not this  dish is huge fail.   Kid's meal was  great value and HUGE  we  are used to   mini hot dogs and string  fries  . Prices hold with a Chilis / Applebees type  location.   Pleasant enough an the  menu has main sections for pizza, pasta, burgers, steak and wings as the main themes plus  the obligatory salads.  If it wasn't next to Cabelas, an I wasn't ravenous for \"anything\"  I could miss this place. Not   I really  want to give it 2.5 stars but have rounded it up."}
{"text":"There is a lot to consider with this place. Chief among those things is the location.  There isn't a lot to choose from in our neck of the woods.   To be fair that's why this location stands out.  The recent renovation was tremendous too.  The bar is now something worth hanging out at, the views of the tvs from the tables are worth seeing a game from, and the drink specials are pretty solid.  There's always a good deal on tap and happy hour runs from 3-7 and again late at night.  The last couple of friday nights I've found this place with a pretty good crowd which is a nice out this way.  The food is typical bar food so there isn't much to look for there.  The wings are kind of small so I'd skip them.  All told, a good place to grab a drink and catch a game."}
{"text":"Native is one of my favorite bars in town.  The bar area is big, the bartenders are always friendly, there are lots of good tvs surrounding you so you can watch the game, and the specials are daily and great.  Trivia night is always fun too.  That said, the food needs a lot of work.  The wings are good and it ends there.  If you want to have a few drinks and maybe watch some sports, come here.  If a meal is your primary reason to visit, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Jason was AMAZING!!!  So courteous and quick!  LOVE him and because of him (and the delicious food) I'LL BE BACK (insert Arnold impression there!!!)  P.S.   The old manager ran the place horribly and for that we quit going for a while and my friend Regina forced me to go and SO glad I did because UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT and THEY ARE AWESOME TOO!!!!  Thank you Regina for making me try it again!!   WHAT ONCE WAS OLD IS NEW AGAIN!!! YAY!!!"}
{"text":"We live in south Phoenix and drive here to play Buzztime trivia and because of their beer selection.  We are always provided great customer service at the bar.  Native wings are okay, not outstanding but they don't suck. This place is clean and nice to visit."}
{"text":"Sorry to update this. Ordered a pound of strippers. There were cold. We didn't send them back but should have. We told Efrain they were cold. Waiting on a pizza to take home. If it's cold, this will be a one star. Finally have a couple of decent beers other than the lites and Hensley staples. Native is close by for us, but we also want good food and a nice selection of beers. Slowly going to lose our business. Not much selection in Laveen. Sad."}
{"text":"Well,  a year later, we were greeted at the door by Myrna, Tony the bartender introduced himself to us so that's a great start.  To top it off,  Deschutes Fresh squeezed on tap, had a good flatbread and trivia competition.  Fun time today."}
{"text":"Wife was out of town and sitting alone at home was driving me crazy. I went out. I have not been here in years. Sat at the bar. Guy was nice and service decent. But got to say I was surprised at how small my plate of chicken was. It was 9.99 so I guess they consider it an appetizer. I should have asked. But when I noticed it was barely luke warm at best I didn't really care. Had to eat. Just praying it was cooked and I don't get sick. Man almighty quality control is dead here. Not the place it used to be that's for sure."}
{"text":"Had great service, food came out hot & fresh. Servers were attentive.  Had wings first & they were delish, wanted more but ordered food which was very good.   We will be frequenting this location again."}
{"text":"I was told the wings here were good and I should check it out since it was close to my hotel.   Admittedly, the wings were good and the beer was cold but the bar smelled like someone yacked in the corner and no one cleaned it up. I grabbed a seat at the bar, the bartender was fine (Cory?) and did her job well.  I would go back for wings but someone need an air freshener in there."}
{"text":"5/21/16 So we are back. Got Cynthia again. Just perfect service. Small issue handled!!!!!!  No problem. Would recommend to all.  New GM, great service and great food. This is now a five star for us.  Love it.   Get Cynthia for great service.    WELL DONE love the changes"}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly waiter. The people around us made so much noise for the basketball games. The pizza is good. Priced how it should be. Not to cheap not to expensive. We will Def be returning."}
{"text":"Very bad service , poor leadership skills , the waiter was writing are order on a napkin, and was spaced out , might have been on Something!!!! He came to ask if we needed anything with food in his mouth chewing!!!!!!!!! took way to long to get our food  food was nasty tasting......never go to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving chicken wings and noticed this place. I went on in and sat in the dining area and Jennifer was my server. She was extremely attentive and friendly and everything was great. Had a dozen wings and a side salad and multiple fill-ups of Ice-T and she couldn't have done a more fantastic job of handling everything quickly and efficiently. I will definitely eat at this location next time I am in town. Great job and thanks again Jennifer!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, waiters are nice. However, we always finish our drinks and have to wait a while before getting a refill, if they even remember to refill before we leave!"}
{"text":"Worst/no customer service. Went to the bar area since it was only me dining alone. Allthe bar seats were taken so i found a table right near the bar and was waited on one time during 45 minutes. All the while no other server asked if I needed anything and the girl that served me initially walked by many times without acknowledging me. Every server that walked by did the same. Mind you I'm right by the bar. They had plenty of time and opportunities to ask if I'd like to see a menu. NOTHING. No eye contact no smile no service. I've been in there many times before and this by far has changed my opinion of this establishment. Normally they have average to decent customer service. Even the  manager was there (I'm guessing by the different red colored polo shirt). The regular customers (the ones at the bar who were called by name by the employees) had no trouble getting service. Very displeased with Native. Definetly lacking in the customer service department."}
{"text":"BEERS, GREAT PRICE FROM $4.00 to 4.50  Tall bud light. GM is great staff is fast and awesome food amazing they keep everyone happy. Been coming here trying it out for 2 months. No complaints will come from me."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few weeks ago. Wings and drinks were great. Waitress Meegen or Megan, name escapes my mind was very pleasant and informative. She really helped on choosing the right wings and drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out.  No issues ordering and it was ready on time.  That's about all of the good...the bad?  Ordered the fish and it was 2 small fillets.  That's it...the wings were not meaty at all.  They were more bone than anything.  The Reuben was incredibly dry.  My he sliders were dry and tasteless.  The cheesecake came with a raspberry drizzle?  Well it was SOAKED on raspberry.  Ugh....."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is a good wing place, but is not anything special in my humble opinion. I used to go to this place the nights they had wing specials and I was never disappointed. However, if I had to pick a wing place, I would choose buffalo wild wing's asian zings or funugyz's asian bbq."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Our wings were dry as can be. Pizza was not cut and tasted like frozen dinners. We asked for a pizza cuter and they brought out a butter knife. It was disappointing. On the bright side, the service was decent. Pretty slow, but people were friendly. You can tell it was a just a slum, a lazy place. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Won't ever be coming back to this location our waitress (Amy) took forever to take my family's order and took forever to bring out the check also forgot to bring out a whole flavor of wings and she even wrote down the order. Like how did you forget? She didn't even ask if we wanted refills and our cups were obviously empty. Also told her I wanted my appetizer with the rest of my food and my loaded fries were cold, horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  However, as I write this review,  the staff can't seem to figure out how cash works.  We are, and have been being held hostage as the waitress tries to count change. Holy crap this is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Seated at 5:30, order taken at 5:57.  Husband and son liked the wings (son said it's better than Buffalo Wild Wings), but the burger (even with the bacon) was super bland. The server was nice though."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and each time I have received horrible service. The first time we went to the bar side and the waitress ignored our table. She came by after 30 mins of waiting and then took our order. The food came out 20mins later and then we could not get the waitress to help us. The ignored the table and when her friends came in she was all over them. I'm not sure if it was her husband or boyfriend but she would make out with him instead of working with the customers. We got tired of waiting and asked another waitress if we could have our bill and then we left. Second time I went with my family and we had the same experience. This time the waitress stayed in the back and we had to ask the bus boy to help us out. I would pass on this place if I were you."}
{"text":"1 friend12 reviews  Share review  Edit review  Remove  5/29/2014  Customer service for this establishment is a joke. I had a complaint about a to go order. Here's the short version: I ordered 18 wings with sauce on the side so they wouldn't get soggy on the way home. When I get home there is sauce all over the contents inside the bag. Investigating a bit further, there are only 2 sauces for 18 wings...and one of those sauces is all over inside the bag! These sauces are so hot from the stove that it melted the lid on the plastic little container. So I start to eat my salad and call the restaurant. First I speak to the hostess.  She can't do anything about it so goes to get some other guy who proceeds to tell me he can't do anything about a \"broken sauce\". Nice. Way to listen Einstein. He gets my name and number to have his manager call me but the manager does not call me back, the same guy I was talking to before does. He tells me \"since this is not a complaint about the quality of the food we cannot do anything for you. Even if it was something like undercooked food you would need to bring it in so we could see it before we gave you new food\". I explained to him that this was a customer service issue and not a food issue and that I wasn't happy. He basically repeated that he could do nothing. I let him know to pass on to his \"manager\" (who couldn't even call me himself) that I would not be returning.   Wow! That was all I could think to myself. Pretty sad that Native New Yorker has no class and the staff lacks tact."}
{"text":"The wings are the only thing to get from here. The kids meal was really greasy. The Friday fish fry was okay and so was the chowder. There was no extra seasoning on the zucchini fries either. Lots of tvs for catching the games which is great. Servers were very friendly but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years but had stopped going the wings were going downhill. But recently I was in the neighborhood so I wanted to give it another try... Plus someone had given me a tip I need to try out. The tip is order the wings extra crispy and get them. (Spicy Mustard Asiago Parmesan Dusted) Plus I found out now you can get all wings or all drums or both that's a cool thing. I always enjoy the Seasoned Curly Q's fries... So I would have to say this lunch was really good and I will be back for more wings."}
{"text":"I usually come in on my lunch. I only have a 30 min lunch therefore it is imperative that I get service fast. When I come In I am immediately greeted very time. I will go to the bar rather than the seated dining area. The bartender that works in the early afternoon is great. She can miltitask like none other. She understand the importance of time management along with friendly customer service. Typically she is the only person serving the bar during the day. Overall good experience each time I visit."}
{"text":"Worst place in the area!! Have given it a few chances, but service is bad. Complained to Mngr Carrie about our wings & sandwich taking over 45min while tables next to us had already been served. Not going there ever, and will tell our friends."}
{"text":"I used to love Native back in the day. This is not the same place it used to be. The food is mediocrity at best. The service was terrible. The waitress looks like I am annoying her every time I place an order. Takes 10 minutes to get a drink. The place is a ghost town. I feel like I'm sitting in TGI Fridays, but way worse."}
{"text":"Bartender was great and very attentive.  However, we came for karaoke and the bar is full of little kids - at 11:40 pm??????"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the west side. Native has always been one of my family's favorites so I was rather disappointed with our experience. They seemed under staffed or unorganized. The bar was pretty but hardly anyone in the dining area so it was surprising that we waited over 20 minutes for a table. We were approached by one girl that said she would be right with us, then when another girl saw us waiting she got our drinks and took our order. Then a third girl brought our food. Nobody ever brought our salads. Then when I mentioned it they brought the salad and it was soggy. The boneless wings my daughter ordered looked like they had been previously cooked and then tossed in sauce and the strippers we ordered were hard. The wing prices have sky rocketed and at that price the mini size wings that we were served were not worth the money! We were given no silverware and had to get up and go behind the hostess station to get our own. Wanted to do a to go order but couldn't find anyone. Sad to say that even though it is a short distance from my house I will probably not go back. - Updating my review...since this experience I was immediately contacted by the manager. This shows that they truly care about their customers experience. We tried it out again last night and everything was fresh and tasted great. Maybe that was an \"off\" night and not the usual. We will be eating there again."}
{"text":"If you like hair in your wings and inconsiderate people then you might like it here.  I have been coming to Natives for well over 10 years and loved the food and most the time the service.  Tonight the service was a hair in the food and not comped and offered a birthday sundae and didn't bring it to my 10 year old son. When I asked why he didn't get his birthday sundae she said oh I didn't know you wanted one. We waited and waited for the sundae and paid $5.00 for it.  The bill was all jacked up with over charges and she said oh they comped you some items. Ummm no you over charged and took off those charges! To top it off they told us all the cooks had no hair so not sure how the wings had a hair wrapped all around a couple of my sons wings.  Nasty!!  Gross!! Rude!!  Good luck if you eat here."}
{"text":"On August 13th around 6PM I had a meal at this location. The waitress name was Chassey and she provided amazing service. She was kinda and cordial and wasn't pushy or impatient. This is an establishment I will tell people about because of her service."}
{"text":"I will never come to this native ever again. First we sit down and order the drinks but our waitress forgets till after we are almost done with our appetizers.  Thats was okay....maybe she was having a bad night...  Then she brings us the wrong order and says thats what we ordered...honestly I order the same thing every single time...  She keeps making it sound like its our fault... Okay...  Then when we are done eating, we stacked our plates to show her that we were ready to pay... But she sat in the corner with other servers getting a shoulder massage...wth.   So my husband walks up to her to ask for the check on his way to use the restroom.  As i waited...my husband comes back and still no check.   In the meantime the server goes to the table behind us and chats with the customer about their favorite drinks...THEN tosses the check over my husbands shoulder onto the table without any words!!! WTF!"}
{"text":"I think the people in the other reviews were people who just had a bad day or something. Honestly the wings were not bad and they were CHEAP. 49 cents a wing? Who does that? My main issue is that I ordered 15 wings and the brought out 20 and charged 20. Idk if they just wanted to sell more but luckily it was cheap. I read that my wings would be cold and the service was slow. Neither was the case. I'd go back on a 49 cent wing day."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service at the bar. Took me 20 minutes to get a beer and the bar area was not busy. The bartenders are just morons. Michelle is not too bright. DO NOT ORDER from her unless you want a ton of mistakes. The other bartender wasn't any better. She is the one I had to wait 20 mins to get my first drinkl...Damn!"}
{"text":"Came here for wing night, but was extremely disappointed. The quality of the food wasn't bad, but I have a legitimate concern with the cleanliness of the restaurant. My family sat in a booth near the kitchen. After we ordered appetizers, I felt something run across my foot. When I looked down I saw a huge roach  crawling over to the other table. My husband jumped up and killed it before it crawled on someone else, but needless to say I was completely grossed out. The waitress came over and asked if everything was okay. We told her what happened and she apologized and offered to move us to another table. We moved seats and the wings came out. Shortly after the manager came over and apologized for what had happened. She explained that the restaurant was sprayed a few days earlier and made it seem as though this was a common issue. She stated that she was going to call the corporate office tomorrow  and for me to call her if I had any questions. The manager did take 50% off our bill, which was appreciated, but didn't change the fact that I just had a freaking roach crawl on my foot. I think the more appropriate thing to do would have been to comp the entire bill. I will never eat at this establishment again and hope no one else has to experience this. My family eats out often and I can say I have NEVER experienced this before. The restaurant has an A rating, but I'm not convinced that would be the same if a roach crawled on the inspector."}
{"text":"I do not eat fish and therefore do not order it. I ordered the chicken sliders and nearly vomited in my plate. Please do not use the same oil you fry fish in to fry your chicken in."}
{"text":"Very nice location!  A little higher class than the one on Ray, as this place used to be a steakhouse.  Great indoor/outdoor bar.  And the new Strippers chicken baskets are amazing!  Friendly staff, yummy beers on tap."}
{"text":"Not much going on in Chandler, AZ in terms of great \"foodie\" restaurants, or I may just not know where to go. Plus I had just flown in and I wanted to take my granddaughter out and have a nice dinner somewhere and Peggy, my granddaughter's other grandmother, referred me to this place. There really isn't anything negative that I have to say about this place.   Service: Could not have been better. The waitress was very nice and friendly and my granddaughter really liked her. (which is all that matters)  Food: Emily loves wings so we ordered the bbq wings as an appetizer. I believe they were half priced at that time. For the entrees, I ordered the \"Paradise\" burger (I just love pineapple on my burgers) and my granddaughter ordered the chicken tenders. The Paradise burger was cooked exactly as requested and the chicken tenders were, well, tender...Also, got the sweet potato fries which were seasoned to perfection.   The manager came over to check on us and make sure everything was ok. But most of all, my granddaughter loved it and ate all her food and some of mine!   Thank you Native New Yorker for providing a very nice evening for us. When in town I will need to revisit!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to native in awhile and decided to try them out again. My stepfather and I ordered drinks and it took 15 minutes to bring out when they weren't busy..once we got them, we tasted them and the margaritas we ordered were more water than alcohol. The zucchini appetizer was small for the cost. The wings were good but too much sauce in my opinion. The waiter we had was especially rude once we pointed out that they charged full price for our drinks instead of the happy hour price. I don't think we will be back again.."}
{"text":"The service is quick and thoughtful. The food is wonderful. We order crispy saucy wings and a ham and pineapple pizza. The food looked super and tasted even better. Roxy was one of the best servers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Love, Love , Love the wings.  Had a burger there long ago and didn't care for it so never went back.  Heard the wings there were great to went for the wings and go every chance we get.  My husband loves them.  We always get extra so we can have some for lunch the next day.  Great variety, but I just like asseago parmesan and medium cause I'm kind of a wimp but my husband says the honey hot and mandarin ones are great.  Their pizza looks good, too but have never tried it cause I loooove the wings. If you want a good burger, go to a burger joint, but if you want some kick a$$ wings, this is the place."}
{"text":"The wings are great I don't care about the rest of the food. I love the wings. Our waitress is great. We are happy campers."}
{"text":"30 mins to get cold wings.wife had boneless wings not  good. 1st time there. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"This native location has an incredible amount of TV's to watch, by far the most of any locations that I have been to of theirs. Great for watching football. Wings are great in size, come wet and can be ordered in any amount. Would like to see a larger amount of local beers (or craft beers in general)."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood bar.  Food is average tasting and slightly overpriced  but they do have a bar and all the nfl games."}
{"text":"The bartender Amber is awesome! Very attentive, friendly and sociable! She meets my needs Everytime, never have a empty beer in front of me! U want great service, come see her! They have great lunch specials and their wings are awesome! I also downloaded their app and got free half pound of strippers just for downloading the app and every dollar I spend I earn a point and the points do add up! They got great food and Great service! Happy hour offers good deals too! I def recommend this place to everyone I know!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Our server, Brianna, was wonderful. She was VERY attentive."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we arrived. We sat ourselves in the bar area and sat, waiting for 15 minutes for the server to come over, drop menus in the table and say do you want drinks? Um, we are in the bar...so, yeah we want drinks. We received our drinks 10 minutes later and the server said she would be right back. Fast forward 15 minutes and as we were getting up to leave due to crap service she came back and we ordered.  The wings are always good at Native, no matter what location. The food was hot and we had lemon pepper, parm asiago and Asian garlic wings and they were all super tasty. But, our server wasn't very attentive and seemed irritated that we wanted drink refills. We asked to watch the Giants game but were told that the one guy in the bar wanted to watch the basketball game...even though it was over so we were being blasted by the noise of commercials.  Based on the service, we will never come back to this location. But, if you don't mind being ignored, the food is great."}
{"text":"Don't forget anything on the table, the staff will steal it! Hope the busser enjoys the new Oakley's! The 12 year old hostesses have trouble seating and communicating with guests! For a second I thought they were gonna pass me a note and make me check yes or no if a booth was ok! And don't address the manager about anything substantial, as long as his high school staff thinks he's a cool boss, his self esteem will be neutralized! A little adult interaction might do him good!"}
{"text":"Two trips-same rating for both. Slow service, but really nice. Food is so so."}
{"text":"Okay! I gave it a second chance. After 10 minutes of sitting down, no one came. I saw the bartender see me and nothing. A man passed by me and ignored me. Even the hostess saw us come in. If you come expect sh*** service or NONE at all!    The place was empty to begin with, that's why I went."}
{"text":"This is just another chain restaurant that offers Surprise residents nothing but blah.  Blah service, blah food, and blah décor.  My family and I have tried this place several times and every time we have left there completely dissatisfied.  First, this place has the worst servers in Surprise.  Not only do they lack common sense, they also have no understanding of basic serving etiquette.  Second, most of the food looks like it came out of a box and taste like it too.  Your meal comes to you sloppily prepared and totally unpresentable.  Third, every time we have been to this place our table has had food residue on it.  Gross!  Fourth, I have seen people sitting at the bar with guns on their hip which should not be allowed in a place where alcohol is served.  Fifth, every time we have eaten here our food order has been wrong.  Sixth, the last time we ate here, I told the server that my daughter wanted a dessert after her meal, but we got the dessert with her meal instead which made no sense.  First off, you never serve dessert with the meal if not instructed to do so; especially with small children present because getting them to eat their dinner first is next to impossible because all they want is the dessert.  Secondly, while you're eating the dinner, the dessert either gets cold or melts, either way, ruining the effect.  My daughter's dessert melted into a glob of yuck while she ate her dinner.  Seven, the lettuce on my burger was the whitish clear lettuce that should never be served to anyone let alone a paying customer.  Common sense people...serve customers how you want to be served!!!  Eight, on that same occasion, my credit card was charged for the wrong table resulting in a much larger bill and which resulted in more hassle trying to get server to undo her mistake.  Nine, on our previous visit, I asked to speak to the manager about the poor quality of food and he refused to come over and talk to us and instead told our server to give us a free dessert that we did not want.  Crappy, crappy, crappy management.  My family and I will not be back."}
{"text":"If I could rate zero I would.. a few friends and I walked in and were forced to go to the lounge that is for 21+, we were addressed by a waitress as she walked by she mud-erred ID's.. comes back and tells us the kitchen is closing so hurry up and order!!!.. and a buddy that had a vedical ID was denied service, instead of relocating us to another section. She was beyond eager to get us to leave.. when we asked for a manager they played stupid and avoid us until we walked out.. I have been working customer service for 6 years and I have never experienced service like this!! If you don't want to Work or serve people.. WHY ARE YOU WORKING AS A WAITRESS OR IN CUSTOMER SERVICE?!?!!! Native is GREAT!! Just this location is a backslap to the face.."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went on a wed night it was not busy. We were seated right away. Ordered an app and drinks both came out fast, unfortunately so did our dinner. But our server was so good we couldn't complain it was obviously the kitchen. My daughters strippers were perfect but my wings were so over cooked there was hardly meat left. Not sure I would go back here with all the other options in QC now. But service was very good!!"}
{"text":"Service just ok, food just ok! The atmosphere is cool just about average for the type of place it is. I have yet to be impressed by this location and it's unfortunate because I have been a big Native fan since back in 05. They have made some changes to the company that in my opinion have been for the worst but I haven't quite given up on them yet. They are still pretty good on the wings. HONEY HOTs and SPICY HONEY MUSTARD is where it's at! They have a few dry rubs that are good too! Just have to experiment."}
{"text":"So needless to say Native New Yorker is definitely not the place that it used to be! In years past it was easily a better go to than many competitors but these days it's a mess! I can't speak to the quality of all food but the wings which they are known for (or at least used to be) are terrible now! I have given this particular location countless tries to see if they can get it together but I'm constantly let down. Most recently I ordered 48 wings on a weekday, midday mind you and went to pick them up. There was hardly any people in the place yet I was waiting for a waitress at the front for over 5mins then I walked around to the bar for assistance and they said they would get it boxed up and ready. So I wait another 10mins for them to bring them out and finally she brings them and I head home. I get home and what do you know the wings are soggy and very under sauced!!! I'm like really?!?!? I normally would just deal with it but I've had enough of this under performance from this establishment. So I call to see about bringing them back and getting a refund and I'm put on hold for the manager who then picks up and then hangs up. So I call right back and the manager answers the phone with no greeting other than hello....I'm like is this native New Yorker and she rudely says \"yes what can I do for you\" so I explain what's going on and she just says \"come down and we will get it figured out\". I get down there and as the manager she doesn't even have the decency to come up front and handle the situation she has the waitress running back and forth relaying messages. Being in customer service and being a manager myself I was completely thrown off by her utter disregard for making the situation right. I'm completely done with this place I will give my business to much more deserving companies!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town, Honey Hot is my favorite here.  I can't wait for this particular location to open back up I am craving their wings and the other locations are not near to me and trying to find a substitute in my area is not going so well."}
{"text":"We were party of six. We waited an hour and no one ever came back to us. We got one drink and had put in our order. Hardly anyone there when we ordered on restaurant side. The few groups that arrived after us DID get food. Complete joke - no one to even complain to or explain why we left."}
{"text":"We should have left after they seated us at a dirty table. The hostess said she'd be right back to clean it up and never returned. We asked the waitress to move us and she obliged us, but with an attitude.   The food was not impressive and was served to us without silverware. Then my son noticed a hair in his Ffrench fries.   Steer clear of this place with rude staff and dirty tables."}
{"text":"Great wings, drink specials and service by Brianna!"}
{"text":"Excellent food -very friendly and awesome staff! Great beer collection and lots of menu options. The bathrooms are super clean Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Could have been better.  Service flopped, but to his credit the manager responded by comping our appetizer. Not sure what the problem was but we never got out entree.  The appetizer was very good and the beer was good.  Only issue was service, but we will try again.  I am sure it will be better next time.     Well we did try again (on a Friday night no less) and are vet glad we did!   Awesome service  (thank you Morgan and Casey)!   And the food was very good we tried the Strawberry Hot and it did not disappoint, but we will go hotter next time.  Once agin the beer was awesome!!     Bottom line is we will be back and do recommend this place for others."}
{"text":"Ok, my friends all know this is my Tuesday night stop, I love wings.  Well this week I missed Tuesday, so I went last night (Thursday).  I ordered my usual wings and was shocked when they were out within minutes!  I didn't think it was long enough to wait, but gave them a try.  THEY WERE COLD!  I even had the server feel them!  She agreed they were cold and took them back to the kitchen.  Now I am thinking my food will include saliva or something gross..... when I filled out the survey, as I do every week, because I wrote a comment, I was forced to log in with Facebook!  Then I went to send an email about the cold wings, forced me to use Gmail, which I never use.  Needless to say, I believe my Tuesday nights will be somewhere else!  I will miss Leon!  He is amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here and VERY disappointed with the service and most of all quality of food. First of all we were there early to beat the holiday rush so no reason for the service we had received. Waited over 20 mins for our appetizer- french fries which was well over fried. For our wings we waited over 45 mins and the wing sauce was melted onto the plate from sitting under the lamp for so long. I asked for extra sauce for the wings as there was none left on the wings,due to sitting for so long- which I was charged extra for, never got any refills on any drinks and worst of all a huge party came in while we were there their food came out before ours! Worst service I have ever received and quality of food was a joke!"}
{"text":"Last time we ever visit this place! we had a variety of wings, the Strawberry hot were cold to the touch, the Lemon Pepper were just at room temperature the fries were cool to the touch and the blue moon was warmer then the cool(not chilled) glass and produced no lacing at all which is a very good indication that the beer is too warm and the glass was not clean.  the waitress was not friendly and seemed agitated to be severing at all. I seriously watched her have attitude with every patron she served. Everyone has bad days but in the service industry you dont ever let it show.  We got the fries removed from the order but cannot say we will ever be back. Ever"}
{"text":"I liked Native New Yorker when they were around so when I saw Native Grill & Wings going in near my home, I thought \"Good deal!\"  Went in to check it out the other night and was greatly disappointed. Yuck!  No where near the same quality. It appears the new owner, Dan Chaon, has take a once good franchise and turned it into somthing much less. Obviously he is far more interestred in expanding and cashing in then he is in providing a good quality product. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I had been to this location many times and had great service. Went tonight and it was totally different. Wrangler was our server. Dropped our ranch dressing on the floor and it splattered all over my new shoes. The manager came and apologized and all what was offered were wet naps and them to clean the floor. After that it went even more down hill... he wasn't around to tend to us. I had to get up and ask somebody else for a to go box. My buddy ordered the 2 for $21.99 meal and Wrangler decided to charge everything seperate at $36 bucks. When it was brought to his attention, he tried blaming the system! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place is a great getaway from the grind. They have they best lunch specials. Drinks and wings around 11 dollars who can beat that. They are fast and professional. Great staff who are actually happy to be at work. I would strongly recommend this Native to anyone looking for a fast eat but also a great eat."}
{"text":"I don't recommend. The wait staff was excellent ( the only reason for the two stars). The food was bad. I ordered the Buffalo fish sliders and my companion ordered the hamburger sliders. The fish was typical breaded patties that were not spicy at all, and served on a pretzel bun. Weird combination that didn't work well. Really all you taste is the pretzel bun as the fish is too delicate to compete. The beef sliders were charred black and just dry and gross. I will not be trying this place ever again."}
{"text":"This place still leaves something to be desired when it comes to the food and the service. Overcooked, and understaffed in the kitchen with 2 new people. Why not train a new cook alongside an experienced one? Expect a long wait for your food and the bill..."}
{"text":"I am a Big Fan of Native's food.  I have been to many all over the valley.  This Location is the absolutely worst when it comes to service. In the Bar or in the Dinning room.  My wife and I have both been servers in the past, and have given this Native multiple chances, but have not had a single positive experience.  There are multiple natives close by, visit those instead of wasting your time here.  I promise the extra time driving will be made up with better service."}
{"text":"Ordered the 1/2 pound native chicken flavor Asiago parmesan.  There was not much of a flavor, I guess because it was a dry rub.  I prefer a saucy parmesan flavor.  Therefore, I order a side of Asian garlic which made it a bit better.  Aside from the food, there were many gnats flying around.  All the people in my party were swatting at the gnats.  Then, one fell in my ranch dip as I was getting ready to dip my celery.  Please take care of the gnats situation!  I don't want to sit and guard my food the whole whole eating!  Couldn't enjoy my meal.  I was going to order dessert, but nope!"}
{"text":"I am happy the rest of the crew is still working there Happy Birthday Alexis King xoxo"}
{"text":"We've been a few times with our kids, but I have to say the customer service is really almost nonexistent. We sat down and it took 10 minutes to get our drink order and that's after we had to ask someone to help us.  Once the waitress showed up. There was no apology and it took her another 5 minutes to get our drinks. If the rest of the meal takes this long not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service and rude servers. Drinks and Food took forever. Even the manager was rude. Worst location ever. Next time I'm going to the I-17 and Dunlap location."}
{"text":"This place is so disappointing. The food is underwhelming and actually pretty terrible. We have been there 3 different times hoping to like it but finally came to the conclusion that it's just not gonna happen. We were hoping it was going to be like the other Native New Yorker on Bell which we absolutely love. But it is NOTHING like it. How do they have the same name. Very confusing and disappointing."}
{"text":"Went there and although the wings were good, the service was awful. Had to stand up and find our waiter multiple times to place drink orders and get more food."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and amazing food! We look forward to seeing those that work here. Devon always makes us feel welcome and Carrie is my favorite! We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great wings place is always busy service is spotty mixed drinks always weak stick to beer.."}
{"text":"Still the best native I've experienced.. great beer selection and bartender drink specials. It's 5 star native but 4 star restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is my go-to wing place, particularly in Sundays for football.  It is also convenient to Hohokam Field for after spring training.  Bike ride and beer.  The food is delicious, especially the buffalo chicken nachos.  If the table isn't getting this as an app, I get it for my meal.  My salsa-snob boyfriend questioned the salsa that came with it, but I don't use it (just extra sour cream).  The wing flavor menu is long and has something for everyone.  Honey hot and BBQ hot are my favs.  If you have a sweet tooth, the apple tart and baby bundt cake are drool worthy.  They have a decent selection of specialty drinks, so I like to try a new one every time we visit.  I have been happy with everyone I've tried so far.  For beer drinkers, there is a fairly long list of draft and bottle options.  Our waitress was really attentive and the manager made sure to check in on our table to see how the service was.  It was a Wednesday night, but not crowded, so we got a table in the bar right away.  Our drinks were never empty before we were asked if we wanted the next round.  This week we were there for trivia night.  I love trivia nights, but this one was a little different than what I am used to.  Rather than being a question with one answer, it was done Family Feud style where you gave an answer and your points were determined by the survey results the host had.  It was fun, but I prefer having one definitive answer.  Because there were a variety of answers we had to debate whose answer was better.  Bae did learn to listen to me more often than not by the end."}
{"text":"Food was ok but this was by far the worst service ever! Never got asked if we needed anything, not even one time. Took forever to get our food let alone just to order our food. Pretty much got ignored the whole time. I could understand if it was busy but was not busy at all. Had to ask another waiter for our check. I have never wrote a bad review on anyone but this waitress was by far the worst i have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Lets see.... son ordered Mango Iced Tea, got normal iced tea. Got that corrected. Hadn't even ordered when a server brought us meals. Wrong table. Ordered philly cheese-steak, Received a French Dip complete with Au jus, Asked wheres my cheese-steak, told me that this was, just accidentally added the au jus... which had spilled all over the plate, soaking the sandwich and fries. But wait... husband ordered the Beef on Kummelweck - \"A Buffalo, New York favorite! Roast beef piled high on our homemade Kummelweck roll (a special roll topped with caraway seeds and weck salt). Served with horseradish and au jus \". This arrived with no au jus or horseradish. They ran off to get that. Server came back 8 minutes later with the sauces, asked if I wanted a replacement sandwich. \"Will this also take 25 minutes?\" I'm told that the bar is slammed so it would take 20mins. Never mind, I'll just eat the half that isn't soggy.  Hey, bring my son another mango iced tea. Received regular again... Oh, and during this time, another server tried to give us another tables meal.. again.  Yeah, no."}
{"text":"Lady at front hostess stand was great. Even opened door for us when we left. Our waitress Cheryl was great. Never ran out of drinks n was there is we needed anything. The food was great. Had the wings n they were yummy. All of their food was really good. Only thing that was bad here is there were no lights on in parking lot n when we left it was pitch dark. The lights r there but weren't on. Not good"}
{"text":"It doesn't deserve the one star, but that is the lowest star rating available to leave a rating. When we complained to the manager on duty and told him I wished that I had read all of the other yelp comments before coming here - he stayed that people only leave bad comments as a general rule and never leave good comments??????? They did remove the pizza from our table that was the worst pizza ever made (no sauce, no cheese and only a handful of pepperoni) and did take it off our bill with apologies, did not have them remake as it was so bad!!!!!!!! Do not recommend for main course food... On a positive side, the chicken wings were awesome and the waitress was good and the manager did give is a free entree if we ever returned - we won't!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family & I went here last Mon. for my husband's birthday. One to try something new & different only because there are not many other family restaurants out here either. We started off with cheese sticks (6) & the plate of onion rings (10), it was ok. There menu claims to be serving food made \"Fresh & daily\". So not true the fish & chips was out of the ice box as were the fries with a little seasoning to add flavor. The BBQ chicken strips were even worse than they smelled and served with a side of coleslaw and fries. The club salad wasn't anything spectacular either, a thin slice of cheese, lettuce, meat & three layers of bread along a side of fries. Finally, my sauteed mushroom hamburger, well done. Everyone else was served food & I had to wait another 6 min. only because I asked for a \"well done\" burger so this takes more time to cook than anything else that we ordered and was supposed to be prepared Fresh, I don't think so. Again this food was out of the ice box & had NO seasoning what so ever on the burger or mushrooms.   So dissatisfied with this place would not ever recommend this place nor would I take my family back there to eat, Blah, blah food. Just because the place is \"New\" doesn't mean the food will taste delicious. So over rated and so ashamed to even say I've eaten there but that was the one & only time I will have tried the Native New Yorker. Half a star only because the atmosphere is New."}

{"text":"Tasty food, attentive service. The remodel makes it an attractive place. I will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Seeing the reviews made me a bit hesitant to try this place. But honestly I had such a great experience here! We didn't have to wait long to be seated and our waitress was super friendly. We order the play one special which comes with wings,pizza and a salad! We all fell in love with the pizza but I kinda expected a bit more from the wings. It's a good place to check out and try it for yourselves!"}
{"text":"To start out with, throughout our entire meal we had a direct line of vision into the servers area, and never once in the entire hour was there someone NOT on their phone. Texting, etc. Now I love texting and using my iPhone, and I'm no fuddy duddy, but if I'm waiting 30 minutes for food, and when it finally comes out, it's cold, this stuff makes me mad. We had ordered a salad and it never came, and when the kitchen guy dumped the food off, he tore off so fast we couldn't even ask where it was! There were hostesses lying on the hostess bar, staff shoving food in their mouth back where they toss leftovers and a manager wandering around who seemed to be missing all of this. I even took pictures I was annoyed. As a manager of hundreds of staff, I would be mortified of these kids worked for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in here starving this afternoon, quiet, and the food was well prepared very appealing, very tasty! even the mistake was fixed without anyone making me feel it was my fault,   the reason I didn't give it  5 stars, is it is pretty pricy. I could see 9 bucks for a salad, but 12 is a bit out of my league, so I am very grateful it was good food and good service.  I will frequent again because I can share the big salad with my kid that goes to school right around the corner, the wings are heavenly!"}
{"text":"Okay I am not a sports fan at all and even though this restaurant caters to that crowd I still love it for one reason...their wings! This is by far my favorite place to get Buffalo wings, plus they have a bunch of different kinds to choose from! I have had a few other items on the menu like the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which was also very good, but nothing makes me happier than getting a dozen spicy honey mustard wings and some curly fries! Bonus points to the staff who are always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch the UFC fights, however their service and wait time on food is not as good.  They got some delicious wings."}
{"text":"Just finished up at Native and we had the best server, Liz! Thanks for explaining the app and making our experience great! We will definitely be back! Oh, ask her for recommendations, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service but its not that busy and we've been waiting 45 minutes for our food. Not cool."}
{"text":"Must. Find. . . Beer. Cold Beer. On a quest searching, searching, searching for a bubbly nector that must be in a container colder than the liquid itself. \"What would you like?\" Fat Tire.  Within 3 minutes from my arrival, I drank two glasses with the same level of glee a child demonstrates when discovering and consuming the ice cream chunks on the bottom of a not so well blended milk shake. I consumed with the exact same enthusiasm a crack addicts has during his first dose right after falling from the bandwagon. It was as if I had never drank anything in my life. Everything stopped the moment I felt the bubbles pass from my mouth down my throat and into my empty stomach. It was a beautiful internal waterfall. I was in this desert for so long, and I found my waterfall.  I didn't need any food. I didn't need or want conversation. I left with exactly what I wanted. A cold beer in an even colder glass."}
{"text":"Apparently if you decide to dine here after 8pm, you are treated to dining in the bar/lounge area. Tonight my family and I were treated to dinner in the VERY LOUD bar area, as there was a large post-work party of about 15 people there that was being incredibly loud and rude to the other patrons dining there. However, NOBODY from the restaurant intervened or asked them to quiet down.  This provided for a very unsatisfactory dining experience for my family.  In addition, service was scant...basically get the order, drop the food, pick up the dirty plates, no drink refills or other pleasantries."}
{"text":"Food took a long time. Was not that fresh. Then to top it off, the bartender ran after us saying we didn't pay our bill. When we did"}
{"text":"John is one of THE best waiters at this Native, he was cool, talked about football, found some humor in our \"D\" shaped Onion Ring (inside joke), did awesome on keeping the cups refilled, ensuring food was satisfactory and we were happy! The ONLY one thing we didn't like was the feather on the wing, but it's understandable given we are eating chicken :) but he took care of it and only charged us for the wings we ate. Other than that, go see Mike at Native and tell him I sent you!"}
{"text":"Impressed by my recent experience here only based on the last time I went to Native. The wings were decent sized compared to what they were serving under their old name. Our food order was served in a timely manner despite how busy it was. Most importantly our server was very nice and didn't ignore us when we didn't order drinks right away."}
{"text":"I hadnt been to Native in a long time so I figured I'd give it another shot. Mistake, as always. Service is subpar, food is okay but there are better options."}
{"text":"We have never been to Native Grill before so we thought we would try it out. First off they have flood lights shining towards you, they need to turn them towards the wall. We ordered the Loaded Tots for our appetizer ...#1 it took 35 minutes before they arrived and they were not even hot. They were NOT loaded, they were very skimpy on their toppings. When our entrées arrived the food was ok but again not hot. Our waitress Kiana was very nice and checked on us a couple of times. I didn't want to complain to our waitress normally not worth it. We may not return? Wait and see. If this resturant wants to raise their Stars management needs to fix a few things."}
{"text":"We came here for the second time to eat and once again the food was great!! Our server Jay helped is for the second time as well and as usual he gave us outstanding service!! We love coming here and it's close to our house!! We are so happy with the new management!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I went the staff was rude. There was a piece of glass in my beer and the server said \"sorry\" and had it taken off my tab. Didn't even offer another. Food finally came out and I swear to god there was a hair on my wings. The server said \"sorry I have no idea what's going on here today\". My friends and I just got up and left. They got waters and my beer was removed from the tab. We didn't touch our food. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Good prices, food is decent. The logo looks like a bootleg buffalo wildwings, but fuck it. Not there for the logo"}
{"text":"Always clean :) the service is a tad slow each time I come but enough TVs and trivia keep you distracted from the wait..... And good company of course. Different days have different specials so that's nice as well."}
{"text":"I really like the wings at this place. I like them so much I wanted to have them for my super bowl party last week.    However the customer service is not really that good.  So if I can rate the wings it would be a 5 and the service would be a 1, hence my 3 star rating.   I called multiple time to try and give someone an order and each time I was put in hold 10 minutes.  Finally I gave up and went with wing stop.  Sorry native."}
{"text":"The food is terrible bar food.  Total lack of creativity and poorly made.  The queso and pork is disgusting.  The cheese and pork are out of bags.  The sliders are terrible.  The meat blend is poor quality and the preparation is terrible, over cooked the patty.  The bun was grilled dry???  So it tasted like burnt toast.  The breeding on the onion rings is that terrible rough crunchy batter rather than a smooth beer batter.  The chicken strippers were literally the worst chicken strips I've had.  The buffalo sauce lacked flavor and the breading was soggy.  Just awful food."}
{"text":"I used to love this place would come in a few times a week. Well that just changed, my debit card was ran twice for two different amounts totaling about double the amount I was supposed to pay. I called they said it would be refunded within 24hrs. Well it is now 72 hrs later and the manager/part owner Sam just told me there is nothing she can do about it. UNREAL!!! I will never be back to this location and would advise everyone to check bank statements after using a card at this establishment."}
{"text":"Went with the wife tonight as we both were wanting some wings. Seated promptly and were soon asked for our drink order. Table was slightly gummy but pretty clean. Our server kept checking back with us until we were ready to order. Ordered the triple with a side of wings and our loaded fries appetizer soon arrived. These were excellent so we were both pleased. Our main meals followed as we finished the appetizer and they were served by the manager. The wings were good and meaty and I also had the sliders. They were good but slightly dry. Would have been better if left juicy. Our server and the manager constantly came by to check on us. Overall the food and the service were both good and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to be writing this review based on my second visit.  We had a group of about 22 people and had one waitress taking care of all of us.  The food was fast, delicious and she never missed any of our drinks and always made sure we were good.  I was impressed!"}
{"text":"One thing Native does well is wings.  I usually get their Asiago Dusted Parmesan wings.  Love them.  They are a bit oily and greasy, but hey.. they're wings!  This last trip I went my buddy and I ordered those wings, but on the menu they show up as Asiago wings going on medium wings.  I asked them to put them on the hot instead.  But instead, they gave us regular hot wings with Parmesan on it..  So... the wings weren't great.  Was bummed, but I'll go again down the road."}
{"text":"Service is non existent.  Had to go to the bar to get a drink as there wasn't a wait staff to be found.  Didn't hang around to get food after that,  didn't want to be buried waiting on wings!"}
{"text":"Wow!  After reading all the reviews, I'm not sure we went to the right place.    We arrived pretty late on Saturday night, the parking lot wasn't too crowded.  There was a sign at the desk to walk around and seat yourself...so we did.  They only had seating in the bar area, but there were plenty of tables available.  We sat, and within seconds, we were handed menus and gave our drink order.  Our server was Jeanette, who was very friendly and helpful.  We hadn't been here before, so she gave us the rundown on everything.  We couldn't decide which app to go with, and she suggested the potato skins.  So glad she did, because they were really good.  We decided to get 20 honey BBQ traditional wings.  They were well-sauced and meaty.  I got the bleu cheese and hubby got the ranch.  We totally enjoyed them, and finished them off!  Jeanette was quick on refills of our iced teas, and brought over extra napkins for us.  Hubby took a look at the desserts (it's always dangerous when he does), so we ended up sharing the chocolate bundt cake.  OMG!  It was warm and moist, with hot chocolate sauce all over it...soooo good!  All in all, we really enjoyed ourselves!  We'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"30 dollars for lunch!!!!!  My husband and I came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu, even pointed it out on the menu. Waitress came back to get our order again. The menus were gone, she had taken them but we repeated our order. We ate, the food was good...but when we got the bill she had given us regular prices rather than the lunch specials we had ordered. We pointed it out to her her mistake, she then told us WE should have been clear we wanted the lunch special. That we got more food than the lunch special and we had to pay it. She refused to give us the lunch special prices, making our bill almost double. And then had the nerve to tell us that the next time to be very specific and to remeber that the wings are 35 cents on tuesdays. I paid it, but she got no tip and they lost a customer..."}
{"text":"Disappointing and inconsistent. We came here tonight since I had a great experience with a take out pizza a few months ago. We were without a server for 10 minutes after being sat. Our beers were not rang under Happy Hour prices even after a manager supposedly put in our order. Chicken Caesar salad was missing chicken. Our pizza was under done and bland at best. I we cashed out and got out  of there quickly."}
{"text":"They really have the best wings. Hands down the best wings I should say, there flavors are the best, the wings have a good amount of meat on them unlike other wing places. They have friendly staff that are helpful."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here if time is a issue and if you enjoy food. I don't know if their kitchen is super limited on equipment or what but I've eaten here 3 times, hoping it'd get better. Well, I was wrong and won't make that mistake again. Today was the final straw. They are SUPER SLOW!!! Which, when the restaurant has maybe 3 other tables of people, I don't understand how that can be. The food is just eh- I've had the burger, the boneless wings, and the \"strippers\". Stay away from the strippers- super dry! The boneless wings were burnt and the hamburger tasted like a frozen patty from Sam's club or something and the bun was rock hard. I won't be wasting money here again."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times, on Wing Tuesday.  I give five stars mainly because of the wings.  From Buffalo Wild Wings, to Hooter's, to any other wing place I've grubbed at, Native New Yorker kills them all.  They may not have as extensive list of flavors as Buffalo's, but the quality is far above.  Their wings are breaded, which is my favorite kind, and every wing that I've ever placed in my mouth from there has been juicy and perfectly cooked.  No dry bones, no undercooked drummies, no 'bottom of the bin' batches.   The asiago wings are something on a whole different level of chicken wing.  I usually order about a dozen of these, and then another dozen broken down into the other various flavors they have. The service each time I have been there was awesome.  Twice, our server waived the 'gotta buy a drink to get the discount' thing.  It usual takes a while for our orders to get ready because there is usually so many of us, but no one's food has ever been cold.  We get prompt refills, napkins, extra sauce or whatever else we request.  Friendly.   The atmosphere is great to me.  There are so many HD tvs around that you can see something of interest no matter where you're sitting.  I even requested that the channel be changed to a different game once, and they did it right away and with a smile. I love this place, and would go there even if it wasn't 'Wing Tuesday'.  It is a wing lover's paradise."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant for the family. There is something for everyone on the menu and the servers are super friendly! We recently visited this location and John was our server."}
{"text":"First time at this location, Friday evening so naturally busy. One thing  that really stuck out was the customer service, from the moment we walked in we were greeted and seated, our host explained the specials very friendly young man. Then our waitress came what a sweetheart, I wish I could recall her name but literally can't, blonde curly hair she was very friendly and attentive. Our food was taking a little bit long but a manager came and explained to us that they were having problems with their oven, which we thought was a nice gesture as we didn't ask. Our food came and it was hot and fresh, overall good. We had 2 different males I think managers come over and tell us thank you for coming and telling us they appreciate our business which I thought was pretty cool. Just based on the customer service alone I would come back."}
{"text":"Lemon pepper wings are sub par and lazy. Wing stop is the place to go for these and wings in general. Everything else is fine. Their hosts/hostesses could use a little more experience"}
{"text":"Excellent service! We went around 9pm and it wasn't busy.  We could hear ourselves talk and the food came quickly! I loved the jalapeño sauce on the wings,  tastes similar to green Tabasco except it's thicker and has peppers in it. Had medium wings as well...one wing was undercooked but I just put it aside and the next was fine which was odd.  Medium sauce was good but not very spicy. Other than the undercooked chicken wing everything was great. Also had a wedge salad,pizza and cookie dessert. I can't wait to go back and try the ghost pepper wings!  Highly reccomended for service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Take out from this place was excellent. Wings are decent size and the honey hot sauce is tasty! I also ordered ancho chili lime rub and really enjoyed it. Best part for me is they offer a \"no breading\" option. Huge fan of that. Breading on wings isn't my thing. Tater tots with dipping sauces are excellent and highly recommended. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"It sucks that this is the closet place to my condo and it's such a horrible establishment. If you list yourself as a grill then operate the grill as the hours are posted. If all you can order late night is fried food after 10pm then close your doors at 10pm. I ended up going to Buffalo Wild Wings instead, the place is open until 2am and surprise...the kitchen is open until 2am. Shocking concept."}
{"text":"OK Let's start at the beginning. I have been coming to this location for years. From the moment I walk in to the moment I leave, I want for nothing. From Waldine to Brittany to Kelsey to Nikki, they have been nothing but attentive and engaging and go above and beyond. I was just there this evening when another guest got rude to Waldine for no apparent reason, she handled it and the situation like the professional she is. I have brought many friends into this location because of the staff. Great food + great locaton= Great time."}
{"text":"The service has really gone down. It's a convenient location but I'd much rather travel across town to 99th ave if the service is better. The waiters take forever and aren't attentive in the least bit. It's almost as if they feel you are taking up space. Not to mention the fact that the last time I went, my friends and myself sat in the bar and they refused to serve us our food bc one out of five of us did not have their id. The manager states id is required to sit at a booth on the bar side, yet the sign that states this is on the back of the door that is standing wide open. So how do you expect someone to see that? And if that's the case, someone should stand at the door and card people. Very poor business practices."}
{"text":"Wow! I'd give zero if I could.....service was horrible. Slow, wrong beer, wrong orders all around....took over 30 minutes to get our food and at that point I had to finally ask for our food and miraculously it was ready....all of it....  The manager didn't seem to know how to handle unsatisfied customers....  They cooked our order again....the bartender ended up taking care of us toward the end of our visit and she was the only one on top of anything...  The manager said the hold up had to do with the \"crowd\"....mind you it's after 10pm and the bar area is the only thing open and there's less than 20 people in here....likely inexperienced - Native needs to step it up, they aren't the only wing place in the valley anymore...."}
{"text":"I found out about this place a few years ago while I was in high school. Tuesday nights is wing night, $0.25 wings, and its a damn good deal if you're into wings. The only catch is, that you have to buy a soda to get the special pricing. I kind of have an issue, if I drink a lot of soda and eat of lot of wings, the combination is bad about 20 minutes after I finish eating and I get home.   What's worse, is that sometimes some waiters will make your whole table get drinks for the deal, and sometimes they won't. However, do they really have to make me feel bad for not getting drinks? I'm not easily embarassed with my family, but when this happens on multiple occasions, you get annoyed. Aside from this issue, the servers are friendly and nice. Drinks are refilled often, food is brought out fresh and hot.  Wow, does this place have a ton of wing flavors. Almost all of the wing flavors are solid. I really enjoy all the possibilities. They don't charge for ranch like other places (I'm talkin' to you BWW), and they have ample amounts of veggies with each order. If you're in the mood for wings, I suppose this is one of the best places you can go to if you want to sample different flavors. The wings are also sized well compared to...BWW.   I've tried a few things other than wings here, and to be quite honest I'm not impressed at all. If this place didn't have wings, it might have closed down a while ago.  The atmosphere is very weird. Wing nights are usually full of immature high school students, and like Devon said, they're just plain bigots. I'm not surprised that the atmosphere of this place is very 'bar-like', like you see in the movies. Just imagine a typical southern bar...  I'm a colored person, and when I go here, I don't feel very welcome by the crowd. It's harsh to rate the restaurant on this, because I feel that this isn't the restaurant's fault, but I'd like to be comfortable when I eat.  Before I moved and experienced better hot wings, I would have rated this place 5-star. I went to this place at least 2-3 times a month. While I was away from Phoenix I happened to let my taste buds experience some succulent and better hot wings. The hot wings here are just very plain, no individuality to them. Throughout my travels, I've had some interesting hot wings that were especially unique. While the honey hot, teriyaki, and Parmesan dusted are all good flavors, I can only have so much of them. The service also brings this down a star.  Also, it'd be great if this place did get a little bit more diverse. There are no sports bars that show futbol (I'm talking about soccer) games. I would gladly come here in the mornings to watch some European soccer (ESPN2 shows a lot of matches in the morning). However, I feel like this is such a closed sports bar in terms of diversity. American football, baseball, basketball. Cool..."}
{"text":"The full open starts 1/27/14! We popped in today to try it out while they are still working out the kinks! I have to say service was fabulous! We got Misti who was extremely friendly! There was 3 in my party, 2 loved their meal... I am gluten free... so I am fairly limited in what I can eat there... I got the naked wings (no breading) I can't complain because well... what fun is a naked wing!?! Stupid me, next time I will try something else! I guess I figured if they offered it must be good... live & learn :o) I have to mention I LOVE their cups! Nice and big, ok... yea, I'm that weird :o) Glad to see another option in the area and more business in Surprise!"}
{"text":"This used to be better when it was native new yorker, but overall its your typical wing spot. Unfortunately I tried to substitute the reg grilled chicken with native style strippers on a salad, but just got the chicken tossed in wing sauce. The server was no help and should prob study the menu a bit more to help her customers."}
{"text":"The skimpiest wings I've ever seen offered under the NNY banner. Don't waste your money or time...   Sorry I took my sons here for their first lesson in Buffalo Wings!"}
{"text":"They have a salt and vinegar dry rub chicken wings......yes that's what I said. I know right?!!!! Yeah they are delicious and I love the Sangria. Need I say more? I think not."}
{"text":"This review is based on wings alone... I haven't been here in over ten years, but I still crave the wings. NNY was always my first food stop when I use to visit Phoenix. By far the best I've ever had for many reasons. So perfect. Ho hum. Please send me some!"}
{"text":"It really, really bothers me when servers bring you your check before you ask for it. It happened twice in the same visit here today.  This was before halftime of a football game that I was obviously watching.  So, I'll pay my tab and go to another establishment that won't seem so anxious to rush me out of their doors. I can't say I'd ever be in too much of a hurry to come here again."}
{"text":"Food was great, and Amber provided excellent service while handling a busy Monday Night Football crowd."}
{"text":"The service was ok, but the food was beyond horrible. I haven't been to Native since they changed the name, and the food. Nothing like the old Native New Yorker"}
{"text":"Jeff kept my beer glass full and cold, besides good company if was a great spot to catch the baseball game!"}
{"text":"An absolute embarrassment to the company.  Cheap little franchisee uses the smallest wings he can find and then sends out coupons for this crap.  If you like wings, go to another store and get the good ones.  Most NNY stores are good and serve quality.  This one DOES NOT.  If they'll cut corners on their wings, what else are they doing that you CAN'T see?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in there tonight, and Steve was our server. He was such an awesome server. He provided excellent service and was very attentive to us. He provided great recommendations on what to order and he was on point with all of the choices. We will definitely be back again because the service was so good and request to sit in Steve's section. Great server!l"}
{"text":"The Arizona Burger is AWESOME - a definite \"must try!\"  And Beth - who works in the bar area - is an incredible server. Not only is she welcoming and helpful, but very knowledgeable regarding the menu.  Want the best service? Ask for her!"}
{"text":"Best wings on the planet! Great service and a very clean establishment. Best place to go and eat and watch football!"}
{"text":"Historically, I would give this location a 4-5 star rating based on service.  However, the last 3 times I have been here (all within 6 weeks of time) it has been awful. Specifically the last two times.   My Experience:   -Friday the 8 of December, arrive ~9pm   ~7 minutes: Waitress comes for our drink orders (busy but not THAT busy)   ~10 minutes: drinks come at an average wait, (more than half the restaurant has left at this point, not close to busy)   ~12 minutes: orders placed, including the fried zucchini as an appetizer   ~35 minutes: I let our waitress know that we would like the appetizer before the meal. *It is important to note that a week and a half earlier, we were brought out the same appetizer after our meal was delivered, with the same excuse of our plates were dropped. More to come.    ~40 minutes: Waitress comes and asks \"Idk if you heard the loud crash, but they dropped the tray with the plates so they are remaking your food.\" *This just so happened to be the excuse we got the prior visit when the zucchini came later than the food.* A very soft, non-sincere \"sorry\" is said by the waitress. She disappears to the kitchen.    ~55 minutes: Appetizer finally arrives   ~60 minutes: Order finally arrives... just completely wrong   ~75 minutes: One order is brought out correct. *Keep in mind that our waitress has been hiding in the kitchen, I assume to make sure our order gets made steadily and correct which neither happen to be the case.  Also no visit from a manager to apologize and try to assure us it will be fixed.  We were not looking for any discounts, simply that our correct orders get delivered after a reasonable amount of time.  Non of which happens.*    ~80 minutes: My father goes and asks the hostess for a manager   ~82 minutes: My food finally arrives, incorrect AGAIN. I was suppose to get 1lb of boneless with 2 sauces, received 1lb of boneless with 1 sauce.     ~85 minutes: Manager arrives, listens to my father explain the story in a very frustrated/irritated mood.  Manager has a slight smirk on his face (unsure if due to my father's irritated manner or not but have not received an apology from him yet) so explain in a calm way first asking if he would agree that it is not busy and has not been for the past 40+ minutes, he agrees.  I then explain that I should not have to ask the waitress to check on our appetizer, only for her to tell us they are being remade bc they were dropped.  She should have known that and we should have been made aware of the situation (assuming this accident, and the previous visit, actually happened).  Also that she should not be hiding in the kitchen, making it seem like she is making sure our food is rushed out (it wasn't not once, but twice) and made correctly (also wasn't, twice for my order).  After being somewhat regulars (3-5 visits a month) to this location and always pleased with the service, I am very dissatisfied with how it has been ran and how situations have been handled these past few visits.  May not eat in again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced. 3 times in one meal we were brought the wrong order and then the waitress forgot to put in my entree order! Are you kidding me? I will be going to the location on 27th ave and bell from now on, And that is only if I ever come back to native..."}
{"text":"04-08-2018 at 4:12pm  We had a $144.46 tab...  Server: Andrea   Our server was horrible...  No customer service at all.   She Needs training...   We also placed a to go order (a grilled chicken sandwich with fries) which took close to 30 Minutes to get... we had to ask the Manager for it He checked on it but never gave us a response... 5-7 minutes later our server brings it out...   never going back to this native ever again!    The wings were cooked perfectly and the pizza was really good. Hands off to the cook!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to relax, hang out, and watch sports. The Buffalo Nachos are really good here. My husband usually gets the Hangover Burger. The staff is great as well. We always bring our friends/family that are visiting."}
{"text":"Love this place I was and still am a regular here ! Love the food , service and most of all the management !!! Definitely a regular favorite for my family"}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite wing place but now they put no effort into preparing them. My wings were so dry, there was barely any sauce on them. They are tiny and over-priced."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings for this location. It's always a hit or miss. I use to come a lot a 2 years ago but I've had many issues since. With service or food. The management has always been great with responding to any problems which is great."}
{"text":"Friendly staff ,good appetizers. Pizza was thinner than I like. Little pricey for quality of good.,"}
{"text":"Well I am sorry to say that after visiting Native again with friends Friday night, I was let down. My wife has had bad experiences here, but I convinced her the place was good.  The place was empty when we arrived and quickly filled up. We were in the dining area and our waitress greeted us was polite and friendly while the place was empty. However, as the place filled up, we noticed they did not have enough waitresses or waiters in the dining area, so our service went from good to really bad quickly. After about an hour and a half and no dinner or drink refills I had to get up at one point and speak  w the manager. The waitress had way too many tables and seemed to be drowning even though she was almost jogging from table to table.  This is not her fault, but there appears to be a lack of supervision by management. I found the manager at the front of the store chit-chatting with the door greeter.  After addressing our concerns with the manager, he came into the dining area and started to help out and finally bring drink refills and our food. This is not the patrons job, but management to assign enough people to handle the dining area.  I have to say, I really love this place and the food is always great and did not have any complaints and gave the restaurant 4 stars plus the last time, but it was at the bar area. Anyway, our friends and family were let down by the lack of service and empty drinks sometimes for over twenty minutes. Still gave our waitress a generous tip, because it was not her fault. So my new review gives this place only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Everything was really great! The strawberry hot wings were amazing and the wing special on Tuesday is really affordable.  One waiter for a whole bunch of tables but he tried his best to be attentive the whole time."}
{"text":"We don't have many options in the Ahwatukee foothills. Restaurants often don't last long due to the smaller population in the area. Native has stayed alive for years and I am happy we have them in town. I haven't eaten there very often because I prefer a healthy menu. My husband was craving their food so we decided to order from Uber eats. I was pleased to find their chicken apple walnut salad. It was super tasty. Best summer salad I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. The service was great, we got our drinks and appetizers very fast. The food was great, fresh and hot. Sad that I have lived here for 3 years and my first time here.  Will definitely be back!."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and had one of the most incredible servers I've ever had in my life her name is Micki (sp?) and she could not be any more courteous or attentive. Not to mention their chicken strips (which are made with real chicken and by the way) are out of this world I got half lemon pepper rug and a half chili lime and both were amazing, The most important need the chicken was not dry and seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"I miss the old Native New Yorker.  I was a regular for years at a various locations.. for the wings, service and trivia.  Dropped by today for some wings and a beer.  Service literally non-existent.   As I write this it has been over 10 minutes since I have even seen the bartender.  I have had my card out on the bar ready  to pay while a manager and other server  came over  to fill a water glass and did not acknowledge.  Kicker was all trivia boxes sticky and mine died halfway through a game. Not enough people to drain a battery so they aren't even maintaining them .  So sad."}
{"text":"Really what \"wing\" place charges for ranch. Then it's 59 cents for this little ass cup of ranch. Beer was warm when I got it and the food was half ass. It's no wonder on a Sunday night for football this place is empty. It was a toss up between here and cogburns and obviously I think we will be going to Cogburns from now on....... good luck to you when you come here I won't be ever again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch when I was working from home.  Had the wing lunch special which was good and the service was fast.  Will be back to try a different flavor wing. I had lemon pepper on this visit."}
{"text":"I must say that we tried a different place for wings. And by far this is better. I like when a waitress is meeting your needs but not bugging you every 5 minutes. We got our food on time. I love the sauces and the dessert was warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 items online.  Sent husband to pick up the order. Didn't get my dinner salad ($1.99) with the burger, nor did I get the appetizer combo (13.99) i paid for.  Took forever to get a manager on the phone. She agreed to refund me for the 2 items and stated she will refund me $16.00. - 'a little more than the cost of the 2 items' thinking I would be happy saving 2 pennies when she actually cheated me out of the tax I paid for the items.  Not going back.  Burgers tasted like nothing...."}
{"text":"Got off to a rocky start, but they recovered okay. The Greek salad I ordered was very good. The place could use some comfort designer as it was certainly dated and not a nice looking place at all. More like something out of the sixties with table in the center and booths surrounding the tables and all in dark brown colors and dark carpet.   They had a poker room, which I found interesting, not that I play poker. I'd give this place one more try to get it back up in the rankings."}
{"text":"I'm very patient when it comes to restaurants and bad service. I have a 3 strike rule, so even if I have a bad experience once, even twice I will often try to understand and consider why the food or service was bad. But I've tried eating at this location 3 times now and each time the service was poor and twice the food was prepared wrong (and no I don't order my food any different than most). I like other NNY locations just not this one."}
{"text":"Nothing awful and nothing great about this place. Decent food, decent service, they have all the games on..... not much to review. The wings taste like Native wings, the deep fried foods, same as all other places.... just decent. Good selection of a variety of bar foods. A-Ok in my book when I am in the mood for wings and dont want to drive far."}
{"text":"Autum our server was so great! She was very attentive and catering :) our food was great too!!"}
{"text":"This place is history, and the bomb! Besides the fact that they have great food. The staff is Amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is good, its a great place to, an a great alternative to the Applebee's that doesn't care about customers.   From the wings to the burgers Native New Yorker is good food. This is not fine dining, and I am not sure since I have not been to New York if it's like food there, but it's good food.  Service is a little lacking at times but nothing to important, instead of getting an extra refill on a soda they might miss it. However the manager walks around and is good to notice and get things right, normally apologizing before you even notice.   I would recommend this place to anyone, great for families as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Delicious Pizza!!! We come here all the time. We love it! The service is just as good!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why all the patrons have to request silverware and napkins. The food runner is not a nice person. You just don't put ( well she didn't slam the plate but put in a not so professional way) and then walked off. The wings were not cooked completely and got a bad taste from the 3rd one I ate. Yippie I paid for 6 and only ate 3 because of that. But on a good note the cheese sticks were good."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars being very generous. Unfortunately the old manager left for some reason and the place is just not up to par. Miss the long time hostess have no clue what happened to her. Can't get our refill of drinks. Waitress has lost it, waited over 10 min when she returned with NO drinks she totally forgot. Salad came out and witching 5 min our food came out. Would love to have time to eat the salad."}
{"text":"Love this new place! My family and I always go in and get the same server and she is always awesome! The wings even got better. They are a little bit more expensive than they use to be, but thankfully the wings got wayyy bigger! I love going here on Tuesdays  with my family, always such a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Got my to go order back to my office and realized they shorted me half my order. Called and the little girl who answered wanted to argue and talk over me.  Told me there was nothing she could do.  I wouldn't go back if the food was free."}
{"text":"Not bad, service was ok, food came out fast. Was quite empty for a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Bartender was friendly and fun and enjoyed sitting there. Very good house wine. Food was good  but what made our visit amazing was our server Katie. She was great. Better hold on to her."}
{"text":"Eat here for lunch at least once a week. Place is usually quiet service is always good. Food is always good.  But then again I mainly order mild wings with sauces and tots. The new season tots are really good.  A must try."}
{"text":"Great place for sports and wings.  Love the mild wings and season tots. Service was good. Open pretty late which is nice.  Tuesday's special 35¢ wings.  Deal is like a sore dick, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Spicey hone mustard wings with side of Suicide sauce Excellent! Angela is great!"}
{"text":"To start there are so many things to say about how bad this experience was. Our server Cat was the rudest server I've ever had plus she never even acknowledged us she would just drop the food and leave. Asking for anything was such a hassle for her so tipping her was also a hassle."}
{"text":"Came here instead of meeting my friend in Avondale about a week ago.  We only had a beer each and split an order of fries, but Cody was attentive and ready to help me break my diet more!  This is very much a sports bar, with sports bar food.  I have had the wings on a previous visit, but I cannot say they were memorable.  Buckeye is limited on places to go for a beer and to just hang out.  Native is not bad.  Blue Moon on tap, I'm good!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good place to go for dining in and taking food to go.  The drinks are always on point, nice and strong.  I know they are known for wings and pizza but they have some pretty good club sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"We decided on this location because it's close to home. The appetizers lacked flavor and freshness but the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered food to be picked up and they said 30mins. So we waited tell 35mins to go get the food and even doing that we still waited 20 plus mins to get the food. And they said it was because of what we got was why it was taking so long.. If it was going to take more time then tell us don't give us the same time as the other to go orders! All we got was wings. Pizza. And a burger. Very unhappy and now it's 30 plus and no food!"}
{"text":"Tonight was another great visit at this location! Our server Shawn was super awesome! He was so fun and helpful! Great personality and service!! Thanks again Shawn!"}
{"text":"So bad on so many levels!!!  Went in during my lunch break and there were three people in the entire place. (Should have been my first clue).  We sit at the bar top and order our food within 5min.  Bartender was friendly so there is a plus I guess.  She completes our order and immediately prints us are tab as they do at the bar top.  The time stamp on the receipt was 11:56am.    For this placing being completely dead we didn't get our food; which was just half order of wings until 12:45.   All we had was wings not that complicated. The bar tender didn't even acknowledge that we had been waiting for over 45 min. She found every task imaginable to occupy her time so as not to have to deal with us waiting.    Once the food did arrive it was avg at best.  Not worth waiting 45 min for.  I now see why this place was dead.  Don't even bother.    Wouldn't recommend to anyone. It'll be faster to buy a six pack of beer at Sprouts across the way, buy raw wings and cook them yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to the Ahwatukee Native for years. Never a huge fan of the pizza but loved the wings and service has always been great. Service is still great we look for Gabby who is amazing. The pizza has always been just mediocre so we have went with the wings most times. The last 2 times the wings have been so small they have not even been tasty. We're told last time they switched suppliers and they would be bigger. Went in May 2018 they are the same. Smallest wings I have ever got and out of 15 ordered 2 were drumsticks. Asked for the manager and she said this is what we have now. I see others share the same experience. I am hopeful the owner will see the posts that are coming in and react. We do enjoy all else at this fun little place."}
{"text":"The service was great.  The food not so much. Everything was overcooked. My sons sliders were burnt.  My wings were burnt. The server was great but very disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"As an ACTUAL native New Yorker, this place is a real disappointment. Breaded wings? Ranch with the wings (not offered the choice)? Blue cheese from a jar with no chunks and that xanthum gum shine on top? The owners might have once been from Buffalo, but boy have they pulled up those roots.   I will say the wing sauces and pizza were decent and the restaurant was clean. The manager however took the time to explain his Sinus infection to guests in the rest room...really dude? Come on!  If I was in a group and everyone wanted to go...I would. I might however bring my own Blue Cheese."}
{"text":"I wish I posted for everytime I've between here. Alexis rocks and the wings and pizza are worth fighting the construction traffic"}
{"text":"They insisted we sit outside when we agreed we thought we'd at least see a waitress quicker because the manager was the one who took us to the table outside. Long story short we sat out there 40 minutes without them even asking what we want to drink even after we went inside and told them we were ready to order. So worst service ever"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a review with 1/2 a star! We usually come here multiple times a month for wings but not this particular location due to all other times experience to be horrible. Well tonight was no exception. First off, it was extremely loud and when I  asked our server if he could turn down the game I was told he would see. 30 minutes go by he says nothing and the volume is the same if anything it's actually LOUDER than when I asked. We ordered 24 wings and were told they no longer do that because they changed their increments to orders of 5. Fair enough we'll take 25. Our order comes out with 20 wings. The poor bartender had to check in with us because our server is MIA at this point. I inform her about the volume situation and she informs me that the man I spoke to was the manager and if he said he would check then there was nothing she could do. She was super sweet and kind about it though, although the man I spoke to wasn't the manager at all he was a waiter and the manager was in red. I didn't get a chance to speak to him but needless to say, my family and I now remember why this location doesn't get our business!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow and surly service in the bar. They have ONE bartender working the entire bar area.  Lots of good TVs. But they're not on the sports that are important (like the Olympics?! Or NBA?!). Instead, we have women's basketball. A D'Backs replay. Stock car racing. A documentary (no sound) on Richard Pitino. A meaningless soccer Game. And the NFL Network (a week after the Super Bowl!)"}
{"text":"In general I believe the management hasn't trained their staff well. Called to find out if they had MLB package. Danielle stammered and said since her eyesight wasn't good she couldn't see if it was on! She then eventually said she wasn't sure...but \"you could ask the bartender when you come in!!\" Thanks for that!  Bar surface left with chunk of food from prior guest for the duration of our 2 hour stay (see pics).   Bathroom wastebasket overflowing with towels.   Only 4 local beers on tap (San Tan and Four Peaks). No local bottles. They do have Guinness Nitro IPA though, which is nice.  Happy hour beer prices are decent but not great.  Bad TVs at bars. Can only see 2 clearly at most (and that's only for about 6 seats). Rest of TV layout doesn't make sense. Small TVs in dining area. A couple of the TVs have bad color rendering/need repair/replacement.   Patio small. No misters, fans or TV.  The soda syrup system is beneath the bar and super loud and annoying hissing is often heard."}
{"text":"The sound is atrocious. Juke Box on and UFC sound on = CLUSTER. These guys are clueless."}
{"text":"The Good: We absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other Tuesday for their wing deal. We always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries.  The Bad: I do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. Also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? They are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. Someone really needs to put these girls in check. Goodness. This is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.  We like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far."}
{"text":"First time coming here and took an hour to get a burger on a weekday and after the first bite I find a long black hair cooked into the burger meat!"}
{"text":"This place is still great for Wings, but is slightly more expensive than it used to be.  Come here for the big game on TV. I dig how there's a Bar side and a Restaurant side to the establishment. Good stuff.  Love the different flavors for the Hot Wings. My favorites are the Mango Habanero, Hot and Honey BBQ. Their loaded Tots are tasty as well. If you get a dinner salad, beware that you end up with enough cheese to put out a small car fire.   Definitely worth checking out the Wing Tuesday special.  Super shout out to Nick! He is a outstanding server that goes out of his way to please his guests. Made sure my Wings were fresh and he KNOWS his Buffalo Wings, too."}
{"text":"Called in a to go order of their awesome salt and pepper wings.  Got there 10 minutes later only to find out that I had called the wrong place and they didn't have my order. Hayley however was awesome she got my order gave it to me within 5 minutes and then help me with the brand new app so I got credit for my purchase so on my next visit I get 6 free wings just for using their new app. Excellent experience can't wait to enjoy my wings!"}
{"text":"great thursday specials and always affordable."}
{"text":"Good food, great drink specials. Great neighborhood restaurant. This was our second visit there and both times we were happy with the service and the food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am a  semi regular at this location. Every time I come in the bartender amber always knows what I'm drinking and what my food order is. She always is smiling and she takes  care of her customers. She truly is a asset to this place"}
{"text":"Food tastes good. However wings/ drums are really small. They have been since the end of last year. If you pay regular prices for the wings be aware."}
{"text":"Hands down worse place for customer service. The food is horrible at this location. Which makes me never want to go to a native again but I love native just not this location which is sad cause I live across the street."}
{"text":"Bad service. I will never go back. Wings were salty. Bartender seemed overwhelmed. Ordered fries, didn't get it. I should have known better. The bartender told us  \"he don't eat here\". I should have took his advice."}
{"text":"Visited August 2015:  \"Not impressed\"  I popped in here for a bite to eat during a work day for lunch. The regular sitting area was closed, so I sat in the bar area. There was able 4-5 patrons seating throughout the area. I did not see any wait staff so I sat where I felt. A few minutes went by, and a waitress introduced herself, provided me with a menu, and told me about the specials. She also took my drink order. She took awhile to come back with my drink, and while I was waiting I noticed that she was conversing in an alcove with 2 other staff members and taking phone orders. Another waitress got my order, and provided it to my waitress. It took over 15 minutes for my chicken sandwich and small order of fries to come out. I was confused as to why it took so long since the other patrons weren't eating. The food was delicious. Everything was hot, looked fresh, and the plating was simple. She came back around to ask me how everything was, and I told her honestly my opinion. When I finished my meal, and was going to pay, I again located her in the alcove taking to co-workers and one looked like a manager. I went to the bar well to pay my tap, and she informed me about the reward program and provided me with a refill of my beverage. My meal came out to be less than $13 w/ tax."}
{"text":"It depends on who you get to serve you.  Make sure you ask not to be waited on by Sweaty Waiter. It is so gross to watch the sweat drop off this guy.  He is so sweaty that he constantly has to push up his glasses.  One time I told the manager about him and told him he shouldn't be waiting tables.  The manager said his hands were tied because Sweaty Waiter was a friend of the owners family.  I told him that the waiter was disgustingly sweaty and he needed to towel off and have extra shirts.  The manager told me he does towel off and change shirts but it doesnt help.  Then later he sent him home and told us he was sweating more than usual because he wasn't feeling well. So gross."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time with my friends. Sat at the bar with Tiffany and had lunch. Food and service were great."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed to wait over a half hour for my to go order and this is what I open up to find once I get all the way home. Two \"half pounds\" of boneless chicken! Definitely will be going somewhere else for wings"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The Staff here is so friendly and welcoming. I have lunch here with my father and they always remember us and make us feel like VIP."}
{"text":"2nd favoring wing joint in Phoenix.  (Vine 1st). Hot wings and there honey hot is good.  Wait staff is good.  Throughout the years the native has been inconsistent- recommend going during a game to get the best wing experience."}
{"text":"First of all, the table we were seated at was dirty and sticky. We then moved ourselves to the next table. The window and blinds were filthy making me lose some of my appetite. The food (I got wings and husband has a burger) was just ok. The silverware and cups also didn't look very clean. The service was OK. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar that is known for its wings.  I really like this place for that purpose alone, but I question the insane growth of its menu since I was a regular at the original Tempe location as a kid.  On one trip, we ordered a couple of the \"lighter\" appetizer plates and got a good laugh.  The veggies were as expected, but the cheese plate was simply a bunch of soup crackers (still wrapped, mind you) with some kind of processed cheese spread and a few chunk of cheddar, etc.  Not good.  Same goes for the other times I've tried experimenting with the menu.  Pizza: terrible deal.  We decided to order takeout recently and ended up with a 14\" pizza that cost $20 and was smothered in cheese.  Ummm, nothing like a NY-style pie.  Nothing at all.  My friend Steve from upstate New York says that the wings are nothing like the real deal either, but I wouldn't know.  I'm just fine with the traditional sauce and the BBQ hot at Native New Yorker.  But like anywhere in AZ, don't forget to ask if you prefer blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  My advice: go here when you want a beer and wings, or other bar food.  Don't expect anything spectacular and it should be just fine.  And btw, the only decent beers on tap are Guinness and Blue Moon.  So don't expect a big micro-brew selection either."}
{"text":"I went to this location the other day with the misses and the little one. The place is new and looks great but the service is by far the worst I have had in a very long time. I don't know if I got there maybe at the end of our servers shift or if she was just having a bad day. The food was okay so they don't deserve a 1 start but I think that the owner or manager needs to do some serious focus around customer service."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is good if you're sitting at a table. If you sit at the bar though you'll be ignored by the bartenders who are busy chatting it up with regulars. This happened on two separate occasions by three different bartenders."}
{"text":"The wings were good, but when you promise me \"hot,\" you better nearly injure me or at least make me break a sweat.  And I'm sorry, but if you're going to run a wing joint and nickel-and-dime (or, in this case, $0.50) the peeps for \"extra\" ranch, then you're going to have long-term issues that will reveal themselves in your early-to-mid thirties."}
{"text":"Came to Native, sat down at ~8:30pm. Party of 10, but it wasn't too busy. Ordered waters, a beer or two, coffee, a Caesar salad and another appetizer, and then entrees for everyone. Waters and beer came out about 15 min later. No sign of coffee, salad, or the other appetizer. No service for an hour, until one of us got up to tell them what was happening. Then a \"manager\" came out with a coffee, and a small salad that wasn't a Caesar salad (had tomatoes). He apologized, and said he saw the other appetizer coming out. Nothing for another 10-15 minutes.  At that point it's after 10:00, we got up and left. Found out they hadn't even put the food order in. A party of 9 came in, sat down, ate, and left all in the time we were there."}
{"text":"I'm a long time regular of Native in Tempe and Chandler and consider them a good value and  comfortable haunts.  While the Avondale location has some (not all) friendly staff, they clearly have a long way to go.  The kitchen is below par (in Native terms), serving chicken stippers (boneless tenders) that are like jerky.  They're terrible.  Getting them to grill the things (instead of frying them) was like pulling teeth (and then I think they just microwaved them), and that just isn't the experience I'm looking for when I come in for lunch.  I might try them again in a month or two and see whether this Native Grill can pick up it's game.  Till then I'll keep looking for another place for wings."}
{"text":"Chicken sliders with the toasted buns were fantastic! Always love the potato skins and service is great!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner. We were seated promptly. Our server was very attentive and polite. She checked in with us multiple times. We were very pleased with our service.  Our food took an acceptable amount of time to come out. Our wings tasted good, the California cluck was really good but i have mixed feelings about their pizza. I like the crust but that's it. I don't know if it's the cheese or the sauce but I did not find it palatable. My kids didn't even eat it more than one slice and that says a lot. So I liked the wings, the chicken sandwich, but the pizza not so much."}
{"text":"Wow just wow so I ate here with my family what rude staff now to top it all.off my 8 year old uses the bathroom alot because a heart condition and meds. So one of the cooks was going number two he said and got up flushed and walked out.... Didn't wash his hands he's lucky we were done eating or I wouldn't have paid that so nasty. I told the server she said a manager will take care of it must have been her bf cause we never saw a manager. This is gross I will never eat at this location again. No ecoli for this mom. Ps my server was rude and snotty. So that did not help. Poo finger cook and snotty server... Great. Don't even deserve one start."}
{"text":"I love that Native finally opened a location near me. Gilbert was in need of a wings place.  The staff was really nice but clearly still learning, which is ok given it was their second day open.  The table we were seated at was a joke..  It is right out side the entryway to the kitchen and where the staff likes to hang out.  During our whole meal we had staff surrounding us, which was uncomfortable and also every time they entered the kitchen we would hear \"CORNER\" very obnoxious.  Food was good as expected. Not spectacular, but good.  I will return and request to be seated in the bar, since it was not offered when we were being seated."}
{"text":"So I knew they would be busy tonight due to the UFC fight. But our waiter was awesome! With a room full of people, he kept coming back and gave us great service! The wings came out fast and was delicious! I don't remember his name, but he did a wonderful job.  thank you!"}
{"text":"We have a group of friends that love coming to Native New Yorker as our Sunday night ritual after church. Our favorite server, SJ, always welcomes us with a friendly smile and ready to help, even if she's not our server that night. The restaurant world could use a lot more of her, and learn a lot from her. The atmosphere is relaxed and we love hanging around and eating some good, sloppy wings!"}
{"text":"Wanted hot wings to go but when we got to the restaurant the manager swiped our gift cards which each had $25 on them totaling $50 which should of covered the meal. She did not apply the value of the gift cards to the meal though,  and somehow deactivated of the cards. I asked her to use the gift card serial numbers but she wouldn't. She just kept swiping the card to get the same error message on her computer showing that the cards were empty. Then she left me to go cash out other customers. When she had to get a different manager to help me, he was no help and I continued to demand for them to use the numbers on the back of the card.  He tried to argue with me and say that the cards had no value but I looked the cards up online and showed him that they had $25. After a long time he eventually conceded to just try out using the card numbers which of course worked. This entire process took over 30 minutes and by the time I finally left the food was cold and didn't taste very good. Never coming back here for the for the rest of my life and definitely not after."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened and putting up with the constantly getting rid of the good things on the menu.  Today......they've changed again.  The strippers are now bigger and are awful.  The wings are all gristle and disgusting.  Sorry,  Native you lost a customer today"}
{"text":"After a not so pleasant experience last week I would like to amend my negative review. We Decided to give it one more try which resulted Ina much more pleasurable experience"}
{"text":"I paid $8.99 for to go order of the spinach artichoke dip and I got about a half a container of the spinach artichoke dip that's not enough there to pay $5 for much less than $9 for I will never get a to go order from there again"}
{"text":"Came for a meeting with some friends and have had the best service with our server, Chris and the manager is very personable... it my first time at a Native restaurant and I will definitely be back to this one!!"}
{"text":"Was here with my wife for lunch. Was seated and served very quickly. We both ordered the lunch special salad and wings. Salad was a joke. Lettuce with cheese and tomatoes. That's it. We had the chicken stripper which was deep fried chicken strips with sauce. Not very good. Waitress was good but I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice!!!! The first time we went, our food was served cold. Our pizza and wings seriously felt as if they had been sitting in a refrigerator. The second time I went, I asked for the Native Stripper Platter to-go and when I bit one of my French fries, it seriously felt and tasted as if it had been reheated in a microwave or something!!!! And my strippers were so hard. I seriously couldn't even chew or swallow! They were hard to rip and also tasted as if they were old and reheated. Although the customer service is great, the food is not the best! I've had way my pizza, wings, & stripper platter served way better and fresh at the Native that's located on 95 Ave and Glendale!!!!!!!!!!! And they also have great customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Place was a mess. Dirty floor picture frames had stains on them. My salad had a stump in it. The bathrooms, forget about it, they must use dirty water. Sad, this place really could be nice."}
{"text":"Gabby and Andrea are two of the most attentive and friendly servers I've ever had.  The food was fabulous and the service even better."}
{"text":"This is the very worst native I have been to. Every time I've been there the wings are super old and gross and super chewy. I have no idea why I go back."}
{"text":"We've lived in this neighborhood for close to a decade and have come here off and on even longer than that. In the past they suffered from poor waitresses and the one or two good ones only stayed for a month or two.   Now that we have kids we almost never dine in. We opt for the take out option so as not to annoy everyone with our roudy kids. So I really don't know if their waitresses have improved but their food and the ambiance of the place certainly have. The one thing that kept us coming back is my wife's love of potato skins and Long Wong's lack thereof. In the past 6 months the wings at Native have become so good I think they're even better than LW's.   Another complaint I've always had with this place was they had a parking spot clearly labeled for to go only. However, there was always a car parked in it and I was the only one getting a to go order. I kept asking why they didn't enforce the sign and several times I was told employees, specifically the manager, parked there. That was very upsetting to me. Still the draw of potato skins forced me to come back. Recently they have painted over the sign so it no longer says it's to go parking only. Now there is no to go parking which is slightly less frustrating than to go parking used by management as their own personal parking space.   One other thing, they are normally pretty stingy with the ranch. When we used to dine in we had the manager tell the waitress to tell us they would charge $1 a ranch for more than 2 one ounce cups for our 2 dozen wings and potato skins. We weren't very happy but I think we caught him on a bad day as that was the only time they threatened that. Now I just check the bag before I leave and make sure they gave me enough even if they charge me more. After asking on the phone then again in person they're pretty quick to give me some ranch.   I really wanted to give this place 4 or even 5 stars but the lack of to go parking and the stinginess on the ranch bring it down to a 3 for me. If those things don't bother you or if your wife is addicted to potato skins as mine is I completely recommend this place."}
{"text":"In trying to find a \"positive\" from our experience at Native, all I can come up with is \"at least no one was shot.\" The atmosphere is dark, bleak and depressing. From the way the serving staff lounges around you'd think that this is just something they're doing for fun. I'm pretty sure our server forgot we were actually there; when she did remember she forgot to bring my Guiness--twice. No napkins, no plates until we asked. Finally our $10, 10\" house pizza came out and looked about as appetizing as a Red Baron microwaveable. The larger problem was that our cheese pizza, which we ordered for our kids, did not come out, and we were informed it would be 2-3 minutes. Five minutes later, after sitting and watching our pizza get cold, we called the time of death, paid for our wings and left. The wings are about the shittiest I've ever had. If this place were offering $20 and all-you-can-eat, free wings and had topless servers and did my taxes while I ate--I would still not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"The food just isn't very good. The service is not very good either. However, they find a way to keep the place packed. I just have no motivation to go back and eat there."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with native! Long live native honey hot wings! I used to come here almost once every two weeks and why the hell have I stopped?!?   This place is the bomb-diggity! The beer God's are alway flowing with cold ones and the wings are always lip-smacking awesome. They also apparently added dry-rubs flavors as wing options but I wasn't in for trying a new flavor, I'll leave it for others more daring. However I wish they never got rid of the curly fries as those were my favorite(even our server agreed), definitely a sad day to all native curly fry lovers.   The atmosphere was pretty chill and a great place to have a guys night with big screen TV's galore. Apparently it's also the place to be for trivia night on Fridays as it was jam-packed. With it being such a busy night (and I realized Fridays are busy) the food and drinks came out fast, a plus service in my book.   I'll see you again before I two weeks my long life friend, native!"}
{"text":"Awful...awful....awful...The service, especially at the bar is horrendous...No wonder there is a new \"bartender\" everytime I come in there...Here's a tip..When someone orders food to go and you completely botch the order and also give me the wrong beer when I wait, please say something!!!..Then when I am sitting there waiting to leave and pay my tab for 15 more min., I simply asked for the blue cheese  (which was disgusting) you forgot so that I could finally leave...what do you do??..you go and help another customer...And when I said something, you stated verbatim: \"Sir, I am helping my customer first\"....Wow...just wow!!!!...You lost a customer(s) and now have lost a few more as my buddy experienced the same below par service just last night....Your wings have gone down hill (probably for profit margins) and the service just gets worse....And what does the manager do??..Gives me a 5 dollar gift certificate for my bad experience...Well, I threw it out and I will guarantee that you will continue to see a decrease in business at this establishment...I am also a chef/owner and I can not believe the way your restaurant is ran....It's embarassing to the industry...I will make sure to steer anyone away from there so that they do not have to endure the same crappy service I did...."}
{"text":"They only had one waitress running the entire floor.  Service and food was very slow and when the order came it was wrong. I don't think I will go back. It is probably for the better that the kitchen caught fire when it did and put this place out of it's misery."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday. Chose this place over Buffalo Wild Wings. BIG MISTAKE. Food was horrible! Tuesday's they have .35 cent wings ( didn't know this until we say down and looked at the menu ) but the wings were super greasy, small, no meat, and tasted very bland. I hate restaurants that promote specials like its a deal and all the do is take away from the quality. Very disappointed and will never go here again. Should have stuck with what I know best, Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"So.... They have raised their prices again! Supposedly, they are 25% bigger, so that is supposed to justify their price increase. They are a little bigger, but no bigger than any other wrong place. They are $1 a wing! If you buy the wing packs, then you get a 4-8¢ discount for each wing. Hmm... Is it worth it? You only get to pick 1 flavor for every 6 wings you buy. Their portions for their other entrées are smaller, too. Personally, once they changed their name to \"Native Grille\" it has gone downhill. Very disappointed . There are other places I can go to satisfy my wing cravings."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you'd expect from any place with grill and wings in the name. They have great sports, wings, burgers and beer. The only surprising thing was the service. My friends and I almost felt like we were just hanging out with another one of our buddies. Shout out to our server Nick."}
{"text":"My first time here, and being a wing lover i was expecting a lot from this place... We ordered the Loaded Fries which werent really loaded. But the fries were good regardless. I treaded on to order the wings with medium sauce. The wings were not bad but def not first on my list, or second. They had a really weird coating on them almost tasted sugary? Im not sure what it was but almost everything fried had a sugary taste to it. Maybe its the oil they use?  The waitress was really awkward almost as if she didnt want to serve us or we were a bother to her. She forgot boxes and drink orders a lot, when she was only serving another table and us.. I did expect the place to be crowded but it was a ghost town.  I dont really know how i feel about this place other than its really different and not my thing. I usually dont try out places that are under 3 stars, and this is why.."}
{"text":"The service at this location is always good. The specials on wings are great on Thursday nights. The reuben sandwich is my favorite however, very flavorful. Their curly fries with cheese added are not to be missed. Food is always hot, quick, and good. Their mozzarella sticks are the best I have ever had, they are flavorfull and a lot of cheese with a light batter. Yum!"}
{"text":"This location always provides great food and service. They have specials on wings on Tuesday nights and they have $5 off coupons in the news papers which is great. The reuben sandwich was fantastic. Really full of meat and sauce. A nice change from wings which is what I usually have. Server was great. Always present and asking if we needed anything and got us drink refills quickly without having to be asked."}
{"text":"i've had a big issue with their tuesday night 'wing' night prices going up so now i just go whenever i want wings since they are basically the same price as the rest of the week and usually better then too. they added a new flavor of wings 'Salt and Vinegar'! i tried and i liked! then i had a hankering for dessert so i tried the Bacon Fried sundae...yes it is BACON and ice cream! maple syrup covered then deep fried, in a cup of french vanilla ice cream...YUM!"}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberry daiquiri in the bar, only to be told the blender is broke, wouldn't mind except this is the second time it's happened. Maybe time for a new place."}
{"text":"Joy was our waitress she's truly amazing. Ask for joy when dining at Native. Thank you for being super helpful. We enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"The last few times, before this current time, we were not given silverware or refills on drinks. My boyfriend and I decided that we wanted wings tonight so we came to native. When we got seated, we were given drinks and asked if we were ready to order, right as we got our menus. So we asked if we could get more time. She came back around two minutes later so we just ordered. I ordered wings and the waitress repeated them back incorrectly, so I corrected her politely. We waited twenty minutes for our food and mine was incorrect. So the wings are taken back and she says they'll be out in a couple minutes. Ten minutes later someone comes back to ask what I ordered and wanted.... what?? So I told them if my food hadn't been made it was fine, we would just pay & go. They made my food and my meal was on the house, but I had to wait an hour before I got the correct food. This is quite sad because I love the food at native, but the service counteracts."}
{"text":"I've been to New York and love Buffalo wings and NY Pizza so my Spidey senses tingled when I saw the sign by the highway. It's mainly a big sports bar like Buffalo Wild Wings. I had a pizza and wings. They were not as good as I was hoping but they were decent and not disappointing. More TV screens you can look at so if you or someone you know has ADHD then it's a good place for you. I think I like BW3 wings a bit better but that's just me..."}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is amazing!! Being a huge sports nut this is my favorite spot in Gilbert to enjoy   all big games and UFC fights. I also enjoy ordering out their pizzas for family pizza night."}
{"text":"Bad wait staff with bad attitudes. They'd rather stand in the back with their manager and talk than help their customers. I won't be back and it's a shame because I like the wings.  Maybe a change in Management is in order, You should be on the floor and not hiding in the back."}
{"text":"The food was soggy and the sauces tasted salty!! The place has no life. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a family party and it was really good. It was pretty low key and there weren't many people there. We sat in the back room, which is like a \"party room\" but also kind of a segregated general seating area. Since we were the only people sitting over there it was kinda weird looking into the other portion of the restaurant... but anyway.   We ordered like 100 wings and they were pretty great! We also ordered a pizza for the group and it was really good! I would most definitely come back here again for the food. It was all pretty standard and good prices.   The service wasn't anything spectacular and the location was fine. They recently redecorate with a sports theme, although I didn't see very much ASU stuff :("}
{"text":"Don't know why I keep coming to this Native...they always get my order wrong and the strippers look like fries lol...server is always all over the place."}
{"text":"I will never go back. The service was not bad, but it did take us long time get our food. I had the Arizona Burger. I will never go back. I could have got a better hamburger at McDonald's. They're was absolutely no flavor to this burger and it was very dry and over cooked.The fries tasted like they came out of a frozen bag from Walmart. My wife had the lemon pepper dry rub Wings. She ate two of the 10 Wings. They had so much dry rub on them. They were the worst wings I have ever had. I should have looked at the reviews before I went in. They are two and a half stars, because nobody can give zeros."}
{"text":"go to bootys.. [sp]  check my tips.. sorry guys your management needs to get things figured out.. slowwww service during slowww times."}
{"text":"My sister really likes this place, and it WAS her turn to pick. We arrived during Happy Hour and the place was hopping. We were greeted warmly and seated at a booth right away. We enjoyed a great deal on chicken wings (several sauces to choose from with varying degrees of heat :D) Everything was super tasty. Service was great... We got our drink order quickly, and our food was served hot and without a long wait. The manager came by to make sure we were happy. I like that. A happy first visit!"}
{"text":"Just as awesome as the commercials portray. Excellent bar/restaurant atmosphere. Great selection of apps, food, and lunch menu. Great staff all around, makes sure you are well taken care of. Very clean and accessible location. Great tasting food, very flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"Something is always wrong with the orders.. Given marinara sauce but forgot to give me mozzarella sticks. Given dinner salad with no cheese."}
{"text":"Stuff your face here with 39 cent wings on Tuesday/Thursday, and you'll never be disappointed. I like the hot, strawberry hot, and oriental garlic. I get 6 of each (you can order by the wing. Tell me that's not awesome.) washed down with a Coors Light for $10 (not including tip). I go home full and happy. Also, a good place to watch sports.  I guess you can order other stuff, too. The pizza isn't something I'd travel here for, and well, nothing else is. Whatever, just come for the wings and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"I love their happy hour because I feel as though it's one of the few times I'm not overcharged for wings. At 49 cents each on some days, you can easily enjoy a dozen or so for super cheap. Other happy hours include chicken strips, which is even better, because like I've said in previous reviews, I freaking hate bones.   Asian Garlic is the best. If you don't at least get some of your wings in this flavor, you are doing it wrong and I feel bad for you.   You are also doing it wrong if you order anything other than wings. There's really no such thing as bad pizza, but I don't think anyone ever chooses this place specifically when they're in the mood for it.    Also beware of expensive, flat beers. They draw you in with the cheap chicken, then bam! $6.50 for a 20 (22?) ounce Kiltlifter that looks and tastes like it was poured an hour ago. The beers aren't on happy hour, but the weak cocktails are. The Long Island tastes just like they make at T.G.I.Chilibee's, but is smaller and a bit more than other happy hours. I will still order drinks when I go (you're actually required to for the discounted meal), but they didn't have anything I could enjoy.   Oh heavens, this was a really long-winded way to just say \"This franchise is great for gouging yourself with 1,500 calories of cheap wings and washing it down with a Coors Light\""}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times and had great service. Tonight we came in and we're faced with a rather large group of people who had dropped in unexpectedly. Native was good about being apologetic for the wait and told us 15 minutes....20 minutes later I checked to see what the wait was like and they added on another 30. I threw a fit and walked away leaving the place with my family. I called and gave the person that answered a mouthful, placed on hold to speak to the manager. After I cooled down I apologized for my behavior prior to this and the manager maintained professionalism apologizing for what had happened. A church gathering of 60 had rudely checked in with no warning, leaving the staff to deal with the mess. I want to shine a light on the excellent service we have previously received and the professional behavior of the staff that night. Grade A."}
{"text":"tried chicken bacon ranch bruschetta for appitizer.  very good..will get that again tried the smokehouse sandwich.  not to impressed.  will not eat that one again.  like the grill chicken breast ..maybe it was the fried onion strings..not sure.. usually get a burger."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings are on of my main food groups. One of the reasons I miss living in Arizona, that's right not somewhere in the N East that get's cold, but AZ. Wing are perfect each time, right amount of spice, heat and sauce. Being spoiled by NNY has ruined me for life. I can't seem to find a close second to this, and man have I tried. Love the other food btw, and the service has always been good everytime I go. NNY is my excuse to visit my relatives in AZ."}
{"text":"Its not a bar setup. Its more like Dennys. So if you think you are going to a sports bar, think again"}
{"text":"I only go here when my softball team wants to gather here. Not very many healthy food choices, or non-meat food options. Drinks were just ok and would never go back here on my own.  Service was a little slow both times we went."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is so nice! Bad reviews mean they didn't explain what they want! They do what they need to do to make you happy!"}
{"text":"Been to this location of Native Grill & Wings (aka Native New Yorker) on many occasions.  Ample-sized bar area with lots of HDTVs, seating, cold cervezas, and excellent food.  Honey hot wings are my favorite, by the way!  I'm planning a group event next week and met with Casey, Tara, & Cindy in regards to the details.  All have been accommodating and met my EVERY need.  Remember, in the restaurant industry, they don't HAVE to go above & beyond.  I'm a firm believer the crew at this restaurant CHOOSES to go above & beyond!  There are many restaurant choices in this (Gilbert/Germann) square mile, so competition is heavy.  You choose Native Grill & Wings and you will be a happy customer!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I contacted corporate to voice my concern about my order. I provided all of the pertanent information: order, order number, time of day, etc. I didn't even receive the the courtesy of a reply. So, today my wife said \"Let's go to Native for wings.\" I replied, \"No. It doesn't appear that they want our business anymore.\" R.I.P. patronage, 1992-2018."}
{"text":"Food is always great quality! Great sports bar. Service is always fantastic. Ashlee was great!"}
{"text":"UPDATE-The GM of this location has contacted me and apologized and explained the error. She wants to make it right. I still believe there were some issues w/the waiter, but everyone has an off day occasionally.  I will be back! GM is a true professional!  This is usually one of my favorite places and best locations. Today things were off. Ordered a salad with no cheese on it. Waited and Waited. It was delivered with cheese on it at the same time as my meal. So food sat getting cold while i ate salad. Five wings came in my six pack of wings. When I inquired I was told that things had changed and only five wings come in a lunch portion of a six pack of wings. What?!!!? Ordered flatbread which was dry and hard. Wings had minimal sauce on them. Ordered Blue cheese for the wings but instead rec'd ranch.Didn't see waiter after he delivered food until he brought the check. Sigh. I don't know what's up but I'll give it another try. Probably sit in bar next time. Manager works in there and it's always perfect."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Nothing special but a good place if you just want to watch a game. I'm not jumping to go back."}
{"text":"I love native! But this one is a little unorganized! I'm sure it's only because it's fairly new. Our meal came out really cold after waiting over an hour for it all. But it won't discourage be from coming back!"}
{"text":"Come on guys get it together! You have a ton of wait staff and just can't seem to make it happen. Waited for drinks for quite a while,  Got food and no silverware.  Then waited for silverware.  Then ended up with two sets of silverware.  As far as food goes......It was ok. Although my daughter in law had some slider burgers that had a lot of bun and not much of anything else. I am going to try it again but my give em a chance meter is running pretty low."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood walk-to bar and grill - I really like the happy hour here.  It runs 3 to 7 every day and drink specials all day Saturday.  Early on the week days, service can be a bit slow, but extra staff starts around 3:30.  I like the flat-bread appetizers and, of course, the wings.  Lots of wing options!  They have an appetizer and two entree special that is a nice deal.  The rest of the menu is pretty standard sports grill fare with a few new ideas mixed in.  The bar has many flat-screen TVs for your sports needs, and Buzztime trivia and poker to keep your brain busy.  There is outdoor seating with a view of South Mountain around the bar area.  For the family or little league gathering, the dining area is large and comfortable.  And one thing I really think is cool...the manager walks the floor and talks with the customers.  You don't find that at enough places these days."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great...clean and well kept. It's a bit on the small size, which means lots of waiting on a Friday night. There are no misters on the patio and only two seats for patrons waiting to be seated. My husband and I ordered the same thing: a chicken strip meal that comes with French fries and cole slaw. I asked for double slaw and no fries; Husband asked for double fries and no slaw...a pretty easy order. They messed it up. The portions were skimpy at best. The French fries were literally pathetic, the cups of slaw less than half filled. To top it off, my drink was bone dry (were talking not even a little melted ice) for 14 minutes (from the time I started counting)."}
{"text":"Very highly dispointed with the service and food. Didnt receive our appetizers in a good timely manner which were three very simple plates. The restaurants volume was not even 15% full. Once we were enjoying our food we found a \"Fly\" which is an insect in our wings which was stuck on one.We notify our waitress\"Brittney\" which request us only 4 wings only instead of asking if we wanted our remaining wings replace. Manager came out with our wings. He approach very aggressive telling us why we requested to get the wings replace. I asked him to not raise his voice to us and i explain to him that there was a fly in our food he reply \"so what\" and than i requested to get his busniess card or his name he deny to tell us and walked away and than our waitress\"Brittney\" came out with our bill and i requested to speak to the with the manager once again. I notify him i was going to be contacting corporation and i needed his name after asking a couple times he finally told us his name was \"Nicholas\". I will not be coming back to that location ever agian by far the worst experience i have had in a restaurant. As a business owner or GM i would definitely revisit management staffing (no people skills,highly unprofessional)."}
{"text":"I haven't bothered visiting this location for about a year because of crap service and food. Gave it a shot the other night and they have really stepped their game up! The server was very nice and well trained, the chicken sandwich was very tasty! Kudos for turning things around and hopefully they will keep it up!"}
{"text":"Our server Nick was awesome, you def need to request him next time you come in!  He was very engaging and had a great personality!  He highly recommended the pork con queso dip, which was delicious and had a ton of meat!"}
{"text":"I have always loved native but the staff at this location is so friendly and welcoming! Josh is the Best! He is so hilarious and service is always great! I recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I never even got a chance to give them a decent review. We walked in behind another group and stood there at the podium for over five minutes before the group in front of us walked to the back to find the host flirting with the servers.. The sad thing was it was SUPER dead on a Sunday evening, so it would be safe to assume we would have their full attention.. I said assume.. So after the host sat the four top he just told us to sit where ever we wanted.. we waited a few more minutes to see if someone would bring us menus, but never got one. So we just got up and left.. Horrible experience, and never even earned my business."}
{"text":"Service and beer on point.  Wings were dry inside and out.  Zucchini overcooked and basically all food (we ordered boneless wings and strips) lacked flavor, onion rings okay tho.  Everybody was super nice so I didn't have the heart to tell them the food sucked"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time on 9/5. We came in about 9:25 PM. Family of 5 : we were seated fairly quickly. Service started off fair, our server was Kaytlyn. Started with the 24 pack of chicken wings- which we thought were pretty good. Able to choose up to 4 sauces. We went with the Chipotle BBQ, Strawberry Hot, Asian Garlic & Reg. Hot. Our favorite was the Strawberry! Main meals were 2) California Clucks, 1 Topper Burger, Kids Meal-sliders, Fish & Chips Platter & a side of soup ( which was suppose to be Broccoli/Cz) prior to our food coming out, our server informed us that the soup was Chicken Noodle, so I opt'ed out of that & asked for a side salad. Was planning to give my fries & slaw to the kids. Kids sliders were over cooked. When our meals arrived : the portion of fries on all 4 other plates for the cost was less than average. My fish platter was suppose to have coleslaw & fries? It only had 3 VERY OVER COOKED pieces of fish, so I assumed that they just gave me the salad as a \"sub\" item instead of the sides? I was never given any options so-I asked the young man who served us if that were the case & he said yes! Serves lacked on drinks. My husband \"2nd\" beer never arrived until we were almost done with our meals: but yet in the banquet room more attention was giving (as we noticed their server walk by us numerous times with full drink trays) to the party that we saw indulging in drink after drink &  \" shot after shot\".  When our bill arrived my fish platter meal was almost $20 after they charged additional costs for a side soup $1.29 ( I never received/ declined ) & an added charge of $3.89 for my \"side salad\" . The platter alone was $11.89 that came with NO slaw or fries! Rip off!! Complete confusion, brought this to the attention of our waitress and then we discuss these fees with the manager, which in turn she ended up taking off those charges.  Wasn't a great experience, not really a \"family feel place\" and we won't be back."}
{"text":"App is HORRIBLE! Second time I've gotten all the way to the end, and it won't take a payment. I have to then call in my order. The problem is not calling in the order, the problem is is I don't earn my reward points. And the store doesn't know how to help you get your points when you have to call in your order because they're app doesn't work!"}
{"text":"I don't know how people can eat here. The food is all grease and fat. The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.  I felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too.   The quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).    There was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though."}
{"text":"My family and I have been fans of this Native location for years now, but after our past couple of visits, I'm not sure if we'll be back again.  Last week, the female hostess treated us \"fair,\" but nothing too bad to complain about. During our dinner, we accidentally spilled a drink on our table, and as we tried to clean up our mess, a female worker saw what happened and walked right on by, acting as if she did not see anything. That is not customer service. We eventually flagged down a different worker, who we asked for a towel to clean the mess, she brought us a towel and we cleaned our table. Just as we finished, the party behind us spilled a drink also, so we handed them our towel as a kind gesture. Just then the same girl walked by, saw what happened to them also, and did not have the courtesy to ask what she could do. Okay, we will give Native another chance next time...  Today, my mother and I went to Native for dinner. As we walked in, the hostess was blatantly unfriendly and unorganized. We told her we wanted a booth, and she said okay. We then sat down and waited for a couple of minutes until my mother noticed that newcomers were being sat down, despite the fact that we were there first. My mom then walked over and asked the female hostess if she took our party name to be seated. She replied, \"yes.\" My mother then asked what the party name was. She replied, \"Dan.\" My mother said no that is not our name, and the female then asked what our party name was. Who knows where the name \"Dan\" came from. The bottom line is that they were unprofessional, and not only that, but she was very snotty and rude.  My mother worked in customer service for 18 years, and knows that any worker should take their job as serious as possible. It's a shame that businesses hire poor employees, whom ruin the experience of the business itself for customers.   Hope this helps, and wish you all luck on your next visit to Native. God Bless!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch, our waitress (Lynn) was clueless when we were ordering. My partner asked for an Arizona burger and she was trying to talk him out of it and to order something else. When the burger came it didn't even have avocado or chili's like the menu stated. Strike 1 I asked for dry rub salt and pepper wings 15 when they came out 8 had no seasoning and were tough like they may have been days old. Strike 2 When we asked for split checks in the beginning she brought one ticket out and said she will split when we pay, she said she forgot. I think she was sampling the beer in the back she couldn't do anything right. My partner didn't even leave a tip. And I left a small amount. Sorry this location has been weak in the customer service side in the few other times I have come out for lunch or dinner. Like the wait staff could care less if they are there or not. Thank you but I will go to El Mirage or Goodyear and Avondale locations with nicer staff. I usually hate to blast restaurants but we did not have a good experience here."}
{"text":"Slow MNF night, you'd think they'd be quick and good. Instead the service was very slow and food uninspiring. We had to send back a pizza. Manager wasn't much help, offer a free beer or dessert will ya? Used to be a great place, sadly we'll be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The happy hour drink specials were good but minimal price reduction on the food.  The pork queso was delicious and so were the philly cheese steak sandwiches.  We wouldn't order the boneless wings again since they were really tiny for the price.  The most negative thing we observed was our server blew his nose and didn't wash his hands before serving our food."}
{"text":"Just under .40 Cents per wing, Tues-Thursadays with a drink! wow what a deal.  A nice excuse to hang out with friends to enjoy great finger food.  I also like the different layouts of the many locations.  I'm not a big yelper of chains but heres another one that is worth the typing.    These guys also claim that they were the first to bring Award winning Buffalo wings to Arizona, the website states it, so it must be true.  Enjoy,  Kevin"}
{"text":"The wings were just okay.... a little fatty and the bone-in had a slight breaded coating to them. Would not  recommend the buffalo dip either.  However, service was great and they have awesome happy hour drinks!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times before in my 2 years living in south Chandler. I don't remember my previous experiences but this time I was ready to Yelp.  I went in for Friday lunch and received a decent welcome from the hostess. I was seated promptly and after a few minutes approached by my server. She was cordial and took my order.  The order come out lightning fast, like within a few minutes. I barely got through a newspaper article when it arrived.   I ordered hot and medium wings. What a disappointment. The wings themselves were below average in quality. I ordered 12 but only ate 3 and ended up taking the rest home, which I ate late that night.  It seemed like forever for my check to arrive - maybe 8-10 minutes after I asked for it. The serve didn't appear to be slammed.  It is a stretch to give it 3 stars and I won't be back. Sidelines across the street is much much better"}
{"text":"Waiters were not that tentative, had to ask for refills from other servers. The food was very good. We ordered pizza, nachos fries and had wings."}
{"text":"Another stop in AZ that we had no choice in making. The place looks super sketchy, dirty and really run down. However, my fish 'n chips were really good. I didn't think the pizza was very good but the fish was a good size portion and really tasty at that.   This is a good place to pre-party for a fun night out. The drinks were strong and tasty."}
{"text":"Lindsay was our server tonight, she was friendly. I see how some people mentioned they waited awhile other nights they were at Native Grill to get a table, but there were a number of tables open. I take into consideration workplaces may be understaffed at times maybe because some employees called in sick or took time off for personal matters."}
{"text":"Native (new name) isn't horrible, it's just average.   We were greeted right away, plus we had a friendly and attentive Food Server. The place wasn't dead, but it wasn't packed full of people either like Cracker Barrel or BJ's on a Sunday afternoon.  Wall-mounted televisions are located throughout the restaurant to entertain any random sports fanatic.  The food is pretty average, nothing truly special. Pizza and wings are pretty average, nothing that's so amazing to lure me back again. Mild wings are pretty spicy for being \"mild\".  Portions were average.   To the cooks or employees in the kitchen, customers can hear you yelling from the dining room."}
{"text":"My family and I are currently at the Applebee's next door eating a wonderful dinner.  We originally went in to Native New Yorker and after standing in the lobby for 10 minutes with nobody greeting us, we chose to seat ourselves. After 5 minutes, my husband went walking around to find a server.  This is the second time we have had not bad service, but NO SERVICE!  Our last time trying this poorly ran business was today.  I'm disappointed in the lack of customer service.  We walked out and went next door to Applebee's and got greeted and seated right away.  The food was great!  Save your time, and don't bother trying this place.  They don't have time for you."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm from Indiana, so my cousins picked it but the sandwich I had was great! I had a couple blonde bombshells and they were awesome as well! Server was great, Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Best wings in AZ. I like that you can order one of each flavor to make a dozen. Consistently good, never been disapointed...but i pretty much allways get the same thing. The \"Ghost\" is definitely the spiciest chicken Ive ever had. My favorite spot to watch a game, right in the neigborhood."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding! I have the Honey Chipotle wings and the Habanero Mango. You'll love them both. The Habanero Mango came with more sauce on the wings. Regrettably, two of them were dried out. The Honey Chipotle were good also.  Great experience.  Check them out."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing this location for year, at least once a week with friend and family since we all  live in the neighborhood and love sports.  Recently everything has gone downhill and the quality of food is terrible.    The wings (something they used to be known for) are awful.  They are not tossed in the sauce, as they used to be.  Now they pile them on the platter and dump the sauce in just one spot, making those couple of wings soggy & inedible.  They have also grown consistently smaller.  They actually served me one wing that was about an inch and a half long.  It looked like it came off a baby chick, rather than a full grown chicken.  Everything tastes like it is just being reheated in the microwave.    The overall quality of  the food is going down fast, most noticeably with the wings.  The only thing they still manage to do well is pizza.  But, with its host of other problems, is not worth returning for.    I tried to contact them to provide my group's feedback.  All I got was a system generated email letting me know someone would be contacting me shortly.  I have waited almost 8 weeks, and still have not heard anything.  My friends and family will not be returning to Native New Yorker."}
{"text":"We ordered the Family Feast...the wings were good, but the pizza was the most disgusting pizza we've ever tasted. Our server and the manager tried to do what they could to rectify the issue, but by then we had no appetite for anything else & no desire to come back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have it together. It was even busy. Food and drink in a timely fashion. Food was good. But. We didn't have silverware. Couldn't flag anyone down for 15 min. Had to go to the hostess to get it. She comes back with plastic to go silverware. Seriously? Not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Went after the Rams played the Cardinals.  Pizza was soggy, the wings were not what we expected.  They were dry when we wanted Buffalo style.  Server was okay.  Brought my buddy from California for the game and was excited to bring him there.  Disappointed for the most part."}
{"text":"The food is ok service has gotten better. Wings are not my favorite. I had a salad tonight and it was good."}
{"text":"Took a Postmates for this place. Drove over 10 minutes to show up and see the doors were locked and all lights off before business hours were over. No sign or anything. Super unprofessional and bad business. Wasting multiple people's times"}
{"text":"We were invited for the soft opening. We were sat immediately which was nice. The Chicken combo with medium, Asiago Parmesan and Strawberry hot. All were really good. The fish fry was really tasty and enjoyable. Meaty beast pizza was exactly what I expected, delicious. Clam Chowder was awful, much like glue, skip this for sure. Staff were friendly. A bit loud but that just tells you I'm old."}
{"text":"The bartender threw my sunglasses in the trash, along with our finished plates. She acted like it didn't happen afterwards. Unbelievable..."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday with a party of 10. Service was slow, drink refills were tough to get, and everyone's food streamed out of the kitchen over a 10 minute period so we took turns watching each other eat.   What was really annoying is that we ordered a pizza, which we were informed had been accidentally dropped in the kitchen. So it came out nearly 20 minutes after the rest of the food started to arrive.  We were cool about it but surprised the manager didn't comp it from the bill for the trouble. So we politely asked them to do so. Nope. Too bad. Great customer service, happy customers, and good reviews are not something they're interested in.   No reason for us to return. You should also think twice."}
{"text":"We come here twice a month with friends and to every UFC event. Food is a steady C- to D +, but never great. Tonight we had a familiar friendly server and were glad she had our table. Everything was great until we placed our wing order. First words out of my mouth \" ALL WINGS HAVE TO BE COOKED EXTRA CRISPY PLEASE\".  If not, the wings come out reheated & barely warm. So if we're going to eat precooked chicken we should be able to get them extra crispy like we ordered and hot.  Not 1 of the 15 wings were extra crispy. Ordered 3 different sliders and each were dry and disgusting, maybe rewarmed in a microwave, upgraded side to onion rings for $ 1.99 for 6 rings, 2 the size of a quarter. Server didn't come back to check on us for a while so we started eating. When she came back I told her we were disappointed and she apologized but we never saw a manager. We gave her back half of the wings $ 5.00 worth but received no credit towards our check. Not sure if server missed EXTRA CRISPY or kitchen.  Not the first time here but the last for us."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was over-salted (not over seasoned because it lacked flavor). I attempted to come again bit they were charging for the super bowl as if they paid to stream it. prices are very steep in comparison to other wing places. $.85 a wing is unheard of, I'm used to paying 50 to 6 cents a wing."}
{"text":"New Yorkers outside of New York strike me as really obnoxious. They're always going on about the frickin Yankees, bitching about how there's no good pizza for thousands of miles, or, when they feel sappy, whining about how they miss autumn. When I kindly suggest that they move back to this seemingly wonderful place whence they came, they always respond with some variation of \"Fuck off.\" Just trying to be helpful!  So I was a little skeptical of Native New Yorker, but that was dumb, because this is a first class establishment. Immediately striking is that the sports bar portion of the building is well-lit, awesome since its a rarity in bars around these parts. Who can blame a man for wanting a good look at the ladies and what he's about to eat?   And what he should eat is the chicken wings, because they're damn good, and this is coming from a guy that usually doesn't bother because navigating chicken skin and tendons to try and get full is a pain in the ass. Naturally the wings are served in a variety of flavors and intensities, similar to Buffalo Wild Wings except delicious. The \"suicide\" flavor isn't overpoweringly spicy, but it certainly offers some kick. What really makes the wings special, though, is the texture. The very outermost layer of these meaty delights offers a touch of crispness that might suggest a brief moment spent on the barbecue, but then your teeth sink right into the meat of the tender morsel. Plus if you come just for drinks and aren't really hungry, you can order as few as one wing for the sake of something to chew on. Grand idea.   Also, the karaoke here is pretty awesome because it's actual sloppy drunk people instead of American Idol wannabes, just like God intended. And the beer is cold. Amen."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker is not the same as it use to be. The menu has changed and rather than making food to the customers liking...they've opted for \"quickness\".  We had our request come back due to wings unable to be grilled. The excuse was wait time..no one was waiting to be seated. We were also told a sign was in place for for this. No sign was seen and our waitress also did not alert us. We've been customers for years and this same request has been placed the last 4 weeks in a row with no issues. Now its changed? Lame...bring back the old Native New Yorker and management. While you're at it...the mushrooms too!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews, went for the first time last week and the food was decent, way better than applebees. The service was a little slow but not as bad as the experiences I've heard elsewhere."}
{"text":"We tried going to Cogburns to try something new but ended up here. The service is always on point and the food is always prepared correctly. Ask for Steve as your server. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Wings and garbage pizza are solid but the Italian sandwich is not good.  I have ordered it a few times and disappointed each time."}
{"text":"This location USED to be good.  The last few times we have eaten here (both in the bar and dining areas) the service and food have steadily gone downhill.  I'm not sure if management has completely changed or what, but it's clear that there is very little if any training being provided to servers and hostesses here.  The hostess told us it would be 5 mins to be seated in a nearly empty dining area, then another hostess came up and asked for our name and told the other hostess that she needs to ALWAYS get a name - not sure why there was a wait or why the correction needed to happen in front of customers.  Our waitress last night couldn't seem to find time to check on us unless it was to ask if we wanted to order anything else - and it wasn't busy.  We ordered loaded tots and didn't as much as get ketchup delivered with them.  The next time we saw her was when our wings came out (maybe 2-3 mins later) at which time we had to ask for ranch and told it was an extra charge (fine, whatever).  1 ranch for 12 wings... okay.  We had to ask for a refill on a soda and a water to go with a beer, which is odd to me since that's like Serving 101.  At the end of it all, I had to ask for the promotional card thing that was being given to customers this weekend.  I got 1.  At a table for 2. (I verified the \"rules\" were one card per person per table).  When she dropped it off she was almost sarcastic saying \"here's that card you wanted...\".   My husband said it best \"This is the McDonald's of wings.\"  It gets the job done but not well.  Seriously, go anywhere else.  Anywhere."}
{"text":"Menu for wings has definitely improved and the staff is outstanding and it doesn't hurt to have some nice looking waitresses either"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! This place is like the a black hole of restaurants. Imagine Applebees on crack.  Then add a slice of poor attitude from the drunken, masogonistic regulars.  Another slice of horrible managers, and questionable food.  Slowly but surely you will have a craptacular experience."}
{"text":"I have had the boneless wings here but it has been a while. I had a craving for wings lately and decided to place an order. Ordered the BBQ and they started odd, like the sauce was a BBQ and Marinera mix. So needless to say I was not happy."}
{"text":"I've tried ordering food at the location twice through UberEats both time they went horribly wrong . Stay away from this location .   1st order they never gave the driver the complete order.   2nd order they called to tell me they don't have 18 inch pizza dough already made. Spoiler alert he said they make it 48 hrs in advance. Not fresh. Instead of offering a different size they said they would cancel the order."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as I thought it would B. My hubby got the \"suicide\" wings, nothing suicide about these wings. I'm usually a wimp when it comes 2 hot wings & I was able to eat a wing w/out dipping it in ranch for a cool down. Our 7 yr old daughter ate 1 & thought Takkis were hotter than these \"suicide\" wings. I got the Greek flatbread salad w/ chicken & it was good w/ my own dressing oil, vinegar and lemon. The pulled pork sliders were not good, my hubby ordered it with the BBQ hot sauce and it was not hot at all. Overall, not a good experience. Erik not be back"}
{"text":"Wings! You can get them any way ya like and order more on wing Tuesday!!  I like the honey bbq and the pinapple teriyaki.  YUMMY.  Some co workers and I hit this place last Tuesday.  We had 5 in our party and we were seated right away.  Service was good, drinks were refilled, and the bill was brought promptly.  Thats great during lunch hour because time is of the essence to get back to work.  The interior could use a little sprucing up at this site but it's fine for lunch or a quick bite.  Probably a hopping place during football season too."}
{"text":"Went there for my friends birthday. It was unexpectedly great. My friends had wings and I had the pasta. Both were great! The deal on the wings on Tuesdays is phenomenal in comparison to some of their competitors. I had strawberry lemonade which was very amazing as well. Derrick Garza was our server he was very friendly and prompt with our food. We are definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"We love the food and atmosphere.  They try and accommodate and put the sport on that you would like to see.  However, we almost always have to ask for the Diamondbacks to be put on the TV and they are the local team.  We usually get the wings but the California Cluck, Cheese dip with Pork are also excellent.  They have a decent margarita also.  For the most part we get good service and good food but we have had on occasion less then par service."}
{"text":"I am concerned about the food handling practices at this location. I was there for this past Monday night football, I saw the bartender rubbing her nose and coughing while making drinks, not once did she wash her hands. I am now sick as well as another member in my group."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but after reading John A's review, it now makes me a little sick.  But when I used to come here, my friends and I liked it, but it was never one of those stand-out places that you always want to come to.  It was more like one of those spots that we'd reluctantly decide on after each one of us had said no to something else.  Pretty cheap beer, decent pizza and some good happy hour specials. Not bad when you're in college, but if you're past it, you should probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to go in Chandler for Friday night karaoke!  DJ Cat is the best karaoke host I've seen in years.  She is polite, professional, and a great singer and she has an awesome selection of karaoke songs!  Perfect place on Friday nights to dance your heart out or sing along to your favorite tunes.  I'd recommend it to anyone, young or old!  Oh ... and the food, bartenders, waitstaff, and prices aren't half bad either!"}
{"text":"I went to Native with a group of friends yesterday for a quick grub before heading to the movies.  The Hostess were very nice to us.  She first sat us in the corner booth for party of six or more.  But then the game was on and a friend of mine wanted to move to a better table since we cannot see the TVs very clearly.  I got up and asked our server if we can pull two of the four top together in the center of the dining area, she happily complied and even offered to help us move our drinks to the new table.  However, given the location of where we were seating, there shouldn't be a sewage smell because we were in the first table next to the entrance and not in the back near the kitchen.  Maybe because it is a Monday night and there weren't a lot of people there, we get seated fairly quickly and our server was very attentive and check up on us often.  However, that was probably the only thing that was good there.  We ordered wings, a medium pizza, and an entrée of sandwiches with a half-pound of chicken tenders as our appetizer.  We waited nearly 30 minutes to get to see the first glimpse of our food (normally I wouldn't mind but given it was a Monday and the restaurant was not busy, not acceptable).  The first thing that came out was the wings and the pizza, our chicken tenders' appetizer were nowhere to be seen. I was under the impression that appetizer was supposed to be the first thing out for guests to enjoy while they are waiting for the rest of their food, but I guess in a \"sport bar\" restaurant, they do things differently. There was a Native here before at the same location but it was closed down and the real estate became a different restaurant before that too, was closed down also.  Now Native is opening back up under new management so I have decided to give it another chance (the Native before and the restaurant after it was terrible) a couple of things have changed for the better, but my overall experience is still in the negative side.  The chicken tender dish was a super salty, and the meat was dry.  My friend's sandwiches was so bad, the toast was tough to chew on, and the chicken lunchmeat has an off taste to it.  We had to play rock, paper, and scissors to see who would have to eat it as a punishment.  On the bright side, 2 out of 3 of our wings flavors were good, the last flavor, mango habanero, has too much of the artificial mango flavoring in it making it taste like a spicy, meaty candy.  Lastly, the pizza was do-able but given the price and the size of the pizza I was getting, I'd rather order in with Pizza Hut. Overall, aside from some of the items on the menu not up to par and the off smell of the restaurant, we were greeted with an awesome team of staffs that were very attentive and know what they're doing.  We even have the manager coming to check up on us multiple times while we were there which I'd appreciate.  Though I did not bring any of our problems up with the manager since we were in a rush.  I hope that he sees this review and maybe make some changes because I live less than 5 minutes away and it would be sad to cross another restaurant off our list. [699 wds]"}
{"text":"people here realy suck ass. we took my son for his bday . we sat down 30 min later i had to walk over and ask the manager if we could get something to drink. our waiter walked in late for work. management needs to make it a priority that employees practice. ...personal hygiene. our waters breath could peel the paint off a car. we gave this place chance after chance. ..this place sucks ass. hopefully they go out of business and open something better or bring in new staff."}
{"text":"My roommate and I have been to a native before but at this location we had the WORST dining experience ever! We waited an hour for our drinks, our server did not give us silverware so we had to to eat with our hands, the person who gave us our food was not pleasant as well, we received silverware when we were nearly done with our food and surprise, our silverware was dirty! Also the whole team who was on shift gave me the vibe they didn't want to be there. I wish I had something positive to say I really do but I do not! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"50 minutes and we're still waiting for our pizza!  Other visitors already Checked in,  ate and are gone!  This happens every freakin time, absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We came for a quick bite.  All of us tried the wings and were not disappointed.  They have some awesome variations like the salt and vinegar and strawberry hot.  You will enjoy yourself for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday. Ambiance was great for a sports bar. Had a great selection off local craft beer which which I love. I definitely recommend the Asiago chip as an appetizer and gotta get wings followed by a baby bunt cake! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Slowest place ever!!! Had 3 waiters walk by and stare at us without even smiling or greeting us. Took them about 10-15min to come to us. We ordered two drinks and that alone took almost 10 min. We closed out and left. Get it together, that was some BS. They knew we were upset when we left and got stares and no apology.   Will never go back."}
{"text":"Burgers were great but the chicken strippers were tough and chewy. I would think that they would be better being a place known for their chicken wings. Not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant.  But it is in Buckeye, and there isn't alot else.  They have been busy since opening, so it's a good thing."}
{"text":"Please re-open soon. Today I was reduced to going to Hooters for wings. It was terrible."}
{"text":"Good wings great service very busy other food is also good as well beer is extra cold. Sitting is great host really helpful"}
{"text":"This a nice place for wings and drinks. The pizza was overpriced for the quality. $18 for a pizza that you won't enjoy. Walmart pizza has higher quality. Never again"}
{"text":"I don't really have any complaints...everything was good we went at around 12 and it was very dark...like I had to use my flash for pictures...but the food was hot the salad was cold and the fired zucchini was perfect there was a sauce that came with it and it was a little spicy but yummy none the less!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was pretty awesome. We went on Monday to watch football and eat wings. Pretty empty which is good but the tv kept cutting off and on. So missed a lot of the game.  This location has improved a lot. I stop going to this location because of bad service. Very bad service. I would give this location another try just because it seems like it has improved a lot."}
{"text":"Went in to grab some lunch after my haircut. There was only a few people at a couple tables. I stood there over 5 minutes waiting to be seated. No one came over or said anything to me. Terrible service. I ended up walking out. I rather go to the one in Gilbert. They have better service."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! No better place to watch football then Native in Tempe."}
{"text":"We started ordering take out from here because the service is always horrible but we like the food. The bartenders that you have to deal with when you order To-Go are even worse. You're lucky if they even acknowledge you within the first 2-3 minutes of you walking up to the bar. Honestly, the worst service ever."}
{"text":"I ordered food from there and it was horrible I got really sick from the boneless wings they also had very bad smell not very good I would not recommend to eat there at all and prices are not cheap bad wings and bad sauce the food Was super cold and nasty !"}
{"text":"Nice service staff, half assed effort on the food. Chicken Parm didn't taste so good...ala Peyton Manning. Grilled cheese sliced cheese not melted and bacon was a joke, wings didn't get done on a few and daughters salad was returned inedible. Got money back for that one, thank you very much! Not sure if the restaurant is failing and can't put together a decent effort or if that's the way it always has been. One and done for us. Better stuff out there to spend 60+ bucks for family of 4."}
{"text":"Celery is the best thing on the menu. Over priced and really not as great as it used to be."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Native New Yorker for over twenty years. They still have the best wings in the valley. My only reason for four stars instead of five is the wings being too expensive anymore. Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We have tried giving this place a try, every time y'all seem to let us down! Last time we were here we sat down, ordered, and got our drinks. An hour later and all tables around us (showed up after us) received their food and still no sign of ours. By the time we did get our food it was burnt. How does one burn wings so bad?!  Today we decided to go back. Our son ordered the Mac'n'cheese and got this monstrosity of a grilled cheese. It was basically rubber on cardboard. How do y'all expect a child to eat something so horribly made? Then when we got our bill we were charged for for both kids meals when he barely ate the one that he originally ordered. I recommend you guys get your act together, based on these reviews y'all are gonna start losing some serious business."}
{"text":"Not great and not horrible  Went for lunch with my wife.  Wings were sour and had little meat on the bones.  Service was slow.  Drinks were empty for extended periods, then refilled with things we didn't order.  Sandwiches were sloppy and lacked flavor.  Restaurant is marginally clean.  Prices are higher than the quality and service by a lot.    Was edible, though."}
{"text":"So crazy busy tonight. Even with it busy the food didn't take that long to come out. Just look a little to get the order in. Good food tho."}
{"text":"Super hot wings! Yum! Great staff too!"}
{"text":"Wings were not what we ordered (maybe she should have written it down) had to ask for napkins (really, with wings) no soda refills (not one) she would actually stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Really? Take a look around! Then she has to audacity to ask if we were going to be ordering anything else, because she was getting ready to get off. AYFKM? This service just sucked, and the wings were totally saturated with sauce when I explicitly mentioned how I wanted mine. Anyway, I will not be going back to the Native here again for some time. I have found my place for Wings and it is Teakwoods!"}
{"text":"Awful, food and service, place dirty, food sample platter not chicken tenders, they were like plastic."}
{"text":"Havent been here in awhile. Waiter was nice. Food was good. Would go back every once in awhile.."}
{"text":"Guys! It's Native! This might not be the greatest location geographically but it certainly didn't disappoint when it came to delivering what it's known for - good, inexpensive wings!  My family (4 yo included) went on a Tuesday night 5 pm and were promptly served.  The server was about business and treated us well. You can't beat the taste of the 39 cent wings! Keep it real!"}
{"text":"The managers a total bitch who says food comes as is and  isn't her fault when they serve dry chicken with no dressing, Nick the waiter was great about the whole situation, thanks dude"}
{"text":"Wings and Beer! Just what the doctor ordered.  Good sized, crispy wings with a great selection of sauces. For those of you in the east, think Quaker Steak & Lube...  We had honey mustard, and spicy honey wings. Delicious, sticky mess. Perfect.  Now, here's a thing that was only slightly confusing...they serve them with RANCH dressing...I know, I know...my Buffalo peeps are astounded and scratching their heads... BLUE CHEESE, people...wings ain't wings without blue cheese dressing. Must be a regional thing.."}
{"text":"Horrible service. 20 minutes for nachos and there's nobody even in this place. Group of 12 with food coming out 10 minutes apart"}
{"text":"love the chain in general, but disappointed once this one opened. service is hit and miss, food is alright. Will go as a last resort but usually go with other options."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a hundred times to drink and last night the manager illegally confiscated my ID and instead of talking to me about it went and hung out with a bunch of employees to talk to them about it instead.  I had to threaten to call the Police in order to get it back and they didn't even apologize.  I understand the right to refuse to serve but they have no right to confiscate my perfectly legal ID.  Don't go here unless you want to have your drivers license illegally taken by their unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"I love Native New Yorker, but this location has been consistently awful. ALL of the waitresses who have served us are tweeking on something EVERY SINGLE TIME we're there. I understand people get overwhelmed and confused once and a while, but the mannerisms and actions of these girls made us uneasy for the last time. We've been forgotten about, ignored, felt like WE were bothering them (no, we weren't annoyingly flagging her down, she was taking our drink order). Basically they will just walk up to you and say \"can I help you\" in a way that basically says \"damnit I have another customer that I don't want.\" This location is trash central. The one off of Ray Rd. (W of the I-10 and even the Tempe (Broadway) is just fine, but this location just...sucks. Terribly."}
{"text":"This establishment lacks the customer service I require as a result of sub-par management. The food is too salty and greasy. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm here at the bar area and so far have had good service as always. But one thing that does stand out is the busser that's taking care of the tables when the party's leave. Connor is his name. This kid has been working his ass off since I showed up. One of the hardest working gentlemen I've seen in a while. I hope management sees this and recognizes what a good employee they have."}
{"text":"So we came here with a pretty large group (25 to be more specific). It took over an hour for us to get our food. 1. it took our server 15 minutes to get out order correct. I mean, he literally stood there writing for 15 minutes because he was just confusing himself even though we were all ready and set with our orders. 2. no one helped him. Normally servers will have a helper, but this guy was alone which made our drink order unreasonably long to receive. 3. We called 30 minutes before our arrival, so there was plenty of time to properly prepare. 4. every table around is arrived after us, and got their order within half an hour or less. And to add fuel to the fire, we had 5 kids with us, and specifically asked to get their food ASAP, and got nothing until after our hour wait (after 30 minutes most of them started crying because they were hungry, and all 5 of them ended up falling asleep before the food arrived). 5. The manager never once showed his face until we were about to leave because at least five of us asked to speak to the manager. 6. He blamed our bad timing. Literally he told us we came at a bad time so there wasn't much he could do about it. As a manager, it's probably smarter NOT to blame your customers for crappy service. And to add to that, he was just rude and a little too defensive. More like argumentative. 7. He didn't have a clue on how to diffuse the situation. He didn't do anything at all to comfort us, or put us at ease. Honestly, the guy was a douche. I really don't know how he became a manager. Never ever ever coming here again. And neither will the other 24 people in our \"too large\" of a group."}
{"text":"Service is crap. They are rude and don't really care when you get your food or how long it takes for you to be seated.  The hosted was rude and I would never go back there!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Native Wings & Grill on a Sunday. This place is a cool sports bar themed spot to catch all the games or to have a casual night out with food and drinks. The waitress was friendly but didn't come to our table when we needed a refill, napkins and the check at the end, we had to call her. I ordered mild wings and onion rings and I would say the wings had a good taste to them and the onion rings were ok. The best part would be all the TV's they had so no matter where you sat you were able to watch what was on."}
{"text":"I am going to give thumbs up for the service here and  a resounding \"meh\" on the food for this Native New Yorker location.  Most of the credit is due to the wait staff for finding space for our group of about 30 on a Sunday night when the NBA finals were on. Service was by no means perfect, but again, credit where credit is due. This was a fairly picky group and I did not hear many complaints about the service. The server split up the checks according to our requests and made sure we knew that the gratuity was included on each of our bills due to the large party. Some servers will conveniently leave out that fact  Now on to the critique of the food. This is based solely on the food I tasted or the food for my family on my own check.  Wings: supposedly they are famous for this, but the best comment I heard was \"they are better than Applebees\"... not such a ringing endorsement. I tried a couple and thought they were small and dry.  I had the Reuben. It was standard fare and nothing more. Not memorable. Wife had a salad, which she said was OK. My daughters both had the Fettuccine Alfredo, which is what they order whenever possible. They said it was OK but the chicken was dry.  I will give them props for the service. I don't think I will be in a huge hurry to go back for the food."}
{"text":"Wednesday night boneless wings.  Tried chicken n waffle and teriyaki sauce. Potato skins. Looks great enjoying a nice dinner"}
{"text":"I just went in here to use the restroom and all I can say is eww. The entire bathroom was filthy: no soap, no paper towels and the locks  on the stalls are missing. Also no mirror at all. just gross. This for me reflects the workers and the food which is just eww..."}
{"text":"OK hands down I think the best place on the west side to watch sports and get delicious food at a very moderate price.  It seems like the menu always has something that is affordable and I can not really recall ever seeing or hearing complaints about taste.  I will admit the service is lacking sometimes but if you are there to watch games or something I do not see the big deal."}
{"text":"Had the worst service at this location.. My order came out wrong and the server was totally rude about it...I wanted to try some of their new flavors of wings and the server did not want to tell me about them...he constantly walked off fast to avoid serving us it was very strange....I will never go back here..EVER"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for no stars. I am a big native fan and have been for years. This is the worst location ever. I actually drive 25 minutes out of my way to avoid this natives. The staff is so rude. Especially the manager Debbie. I have had to wait 10 mins for a side of ranch which I could see my server as I was able to see the kitchen from my booth texting on her cell phone. And talking to co workers while I wanted for a side of ranch while my wings got cold. Worst service ever. And it's like this all the time."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Native New Yorker before, at any location, so the entire restaurant is new to me.  I was shocked walking in at how many TVs they had (so many they basically were the walls) and how much it seemed like a dive british pub with more lights. Whatever, we sat down kind of uncomfortably anyway thinking we were already here lets just go with it. Glad we did.  Yes, the place is sensory overload. So many televisions, the tv screen trivia game that I love so much, and just a really really loud room. I think even if the room were full of quiet people, it would still be loud as shit. So all this aside, we were having a blast.  The food is ok, it's not interesting by any means, but it is tasty, and my girlfriend really enjoyed her house special pizza. They have incredible drink specials including a Jack Hour every day from 10-11 where all jack drinks are stupid cheap.   Driving home in the car we agreed it was our favorite place to hang out that we have been to in a while. We sat for probably 2.5 hours playing tv trivia game, watching basketball, and eating. I'm usually hard to entertain when I am not drinking, but I didn't have a problem here."}
{"text":"Saturday 2/5/17 a young woman having a meal with her two children and girlfriend was assaulted by a man in his 40's at this restaurant. The offending man, in his 40's was sitting at a table with a large group of his buddies and was apparently pissed that the baby was being fussy. He turned and told the baby to shut up, and when the young woman addressed his misplaced anger, he punched her and grabbed her by the hair and slammed her face onto the table multiple times, all while she was holding her baby. Not a single man at the table or a single person working at the restaurant came to her aid. She called 911 for herself...Just so you all know, a warning, if you want to eat here you are not safe."}
{"text":"Worst  chicken nachos app i ever tasted so small chicken had no flavor came out cold i couldn't even eat two bits...took forever and it came with the food which is a no no ....then the pizza we order was naste felt like a frozen pizza and i order two different types  of wings the asian wing were the worst and i sent them back and got the mild and i sent those back and said i think your chef just cant cook...never will i go back but the one star is for manger lady was great about taking it off the bill and so nice so she was great but food sucks worse then a dirty biker bar food ..."}
{"text":"Great service had Colleen as our server in bar area!  She was so friendly and frequently came to our table. She was attentive and made sure we were doing good!  Colleen provided great service!  Thanks Colleen!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is actually our 2nd time here. Let's just say the first time around was forgetful. We decided to try this place one more time since the kids wanted wings. Waiting for your food to come still takes forever and it wasn't even busy. The servers were nice but I can't bring myself to come here again."}
{"text":"First time here, came with some coworkers to celebrate.  Not a bad place, not great either.  The location was pretty clean, and staff is friendly and attentive.  The loo was clean and smelled clean.    I ordered their boneless wings which was okay, and it came with a salad as well.  Not a bad deal.  My coworkers all enjoyed their meals, and none needed to take any home.  Overall a positive experience, no reason not to come back."}
{"text":"let me start by saying I've eaten here in the past and it was always pretty decent for bar food...but, tonight i made the mistake of ordering their chicken wings....the worst I've ever had....ever....first they were breaded...being from Buffalo, thats immediately a red flag but you don't know that going in....2nd i asked for crispy...NOT! The wing sauce was basically plain franks hot sauce......most of the mushy breading on the wings came off on my hands.,.if you want cafeteria style garbage wings this is the place for you...very disappointed! i gave them a 2 star only because the waitresses are extremely nice."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Native after the logo has changed ,but the second time overall. My first experience was repeated this next go around. . .  Positives: 1. The restaurant was clean and considerably \"busy\" given it was a Tuesday night and no football . . . to my knowledge . . . was on. 2. Our waiter was friendly, when he showed up. I'll give this a pass as he seemed to be the only one working. 3. This is an odd positive but i do enjoy booth seating where the booths are large enough to fit more than four people. While that was not needed this time, it was a mental note I made if I come here with a softball group or a impromptu gathering.  Negatives: All of it was related to food . . . 1. Food was cold. 2. The wings were smothered in wing sauce. Which is usually a complaint I have, but the sauce was cold. 3. The beer tasted flat. I am not sure if that was the problem of the restaurant or the brewery but the Kilt Lifter tasted like it had been there for several weeks.  4. The wrong food came out. . . we didn't say anything to our waiter because we couldn't locate him most of the time, but I doubt the correct order would have been any different as most of it was cold.  This just isn't going to be a place I want to frequent. Maybe if I am super hungry and there is minimal wait, other than that this place is pretty forgetful."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance.  From a distance I saw a nice looking firepit in their outdoor seating area so when I got to the door, I asked to be seated there.  The outdoor seats are very uncomfortable and to my surprise people are allowed to smoke.  Our waitress was very nice about having us moved to an indoor table.  I later found out that they have 2 outdoor eating areas. The other area doesn't allow smoking, but that other area doesn't have a nice fire pit.   Even though there were many more guests, the food was faster to come during this visit.  The waitress was incredibly nice."}
{"text":"The service was ok, very clean. The food was ok it was a little bit on the cold side though and it took a while to get my daughters Mac and cheese which is the most important because you know how kids are when they don't have food and nothing to do. Over all I give this place three stars the nicest thing about it is it's quiet."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! We called our order in and was told 15-20 minutes, we get there closer to 20 minutes and they could not find our food for 15 minutes, they kept making us go from the front to the bar until someone miraculously found our food. We got the food home and our hot wings were over cooked and gross. The only thing they got right was the Mac n cheese for our daughter, but come on it's Mac N Cheese, you have to be a complete idiot to get that wrong."}
{"text":"We stopped in to play a few games of buzztime trivia but they had connectivity issues which no one has been able to solve.  So, we had a drink and shared some chicken tenders.  Hubby had Asian Garlic and I had the Asiago Parmesan.  Also got some curly fries - watch out blood here comes the cholesterol.  The tenders had too much breading for my taste but the sauces were both tasty.  Also the french fries had a little bit of an off taste like maybe the oil was a bit old?  The staff there is amazingly friendly and top notch.    We'll be back to try something else on the menu and hopefully play some trivia."}
{"text":"I havent been here for a year and half, they use to have great buffalo wings, and now ehhhh.  We use to frequent this place every week until they changed there buffalo wings recipe and they are now breaded, not naked.  Met friends down there last night for drinks, but you would hardly know its a Sports bar, because the Music was so loud last night I couldnt hear the person next to me when they were talking! Dont think we will be going back again anytime soon, unless they change things, so back to Applebees we go."}
{"text":"Waitress got the order wrong and then proceeded to \"change the ticket.\" She didn't change the ticket and then I complained once again and was overly rude about their mistake. After saying I wouldn't be coming back again she told me \"good\" I was never welcome back again. Awful experience to say the least."}
{"text":"The worst service. But at least the food never fails. Maybe we should be tipping the cooks. Thanks Amanda for not a whole lot."}
{"text":"Ok, after a long sit at home I thought why not SIX FREE wings is SIX FREE wings! So off I went for a short reward . Got seated and all was good, the server did her best to upgrade me to the $3 beer rather than the $2 Bud, went with the Bud...can't say I like the Bud..guess that's what they get for ripping of Budvar the REAL Budweiser.. its a Czech thing ask anyone Czech, I got 2 oriental, 2 Honey BBQ and 2 Parmesan wings. All were quite good and well made. Can't beat the total price of $3.18 with tip. Guess I shoulda gone for lunch earlier also. Two short notes: she had no idea on the special, gezz all over the net. and one BIG FAIL hence only 4 stars.  NO HANDY WIPES!!!  Come one you bring an order of wings and no WETs to clean your fingers? FAIL!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The wings were pretty skimpy - hardly any meat on the bones. I think Buffalo Wild Wings offer better value."}
{"text":"We stopped by after the Suns game for some drinks. DeAnna was an amazing waitress for us and so we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is always great when I come. The wings are great. My favorite appetizer are the plain tots with the three sauces. Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Increasing my rating to 3 stars from 1 because of today's service. Waiter was really good today. Only reason I didn't mark with a 5 is because the first batch of wings that came out were cold and stale. Manager came around and I let her know. She got me a fresh batch that was delicious. My favorite flavors are medium buffalo and honey BBQ. Tater tots and potato skins are my favorite appetizers.   On Tuesday's, wings are 69 cents with a beverage purchase. They also have a rewards program. Spend $100 cumulatively and get a $10 dollar credit."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night. Atmosphere was great as a lot of people were in their 'Friday Night' mood. I sat at the bar and it took a while before my order was taken, for my food to come out, and for the check to make its way to me. Bartender didn't look friendly. I think she needed help. Wings were colder than usual, too. I didn't say anything because I was starving and didn't want to wait for another batch to come out. They're usually solid here. Positive are that they have free wifi and the fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but waiter was new. It was like they hired him off the street to work right away as he didn't know the menu, he charged us incorrectly, and he was not attentive at all. Food came late, drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner. My girl asked him for ketchup since she got a side of fries and he brought it out like 10 minutes later."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time after a not so great first visit. I love Native but this location's management needs to provide additional training to their staff on order taking and checking in, and training for the cooks on ensuring good and correct orders. I ordered traditional wings and got boneless, the mistake made me wait an additional 20 minutes. My sister ordered a cookie dessert and there was hardly any cookie to eat. She and my nephew were not happy but didn't say anything because we just wanted to go. Waitress was very nice, she's just probably inexperienced. She gave me the wrong amount on my tab but it was fixed after it was brought to her attention. She called a manager over because she needed help with it. A few employees sitting around goofing with each other. As a manager I was just thinking I would have this staff in huddles to go over how to provide great service and give best practices, and/or training during downtime."}
{"text":"So Alexis. Was out server/bartender. Said she would get our menus but didn't. I had to go get my own. When out food was dropped off, she took around five minutes to get back to us to see how or for was. If she did the two bite standard, she would have learned sooner that my friend was not happy with their selection. Alexis was not seen very often behind the bar or on the floor. We say by the entrance to the patio which had two takes and she only went passed us twice. My friend also go no trek to get water. Server attentiveness skills are at an all time low. At the end of our meal, a manager died up. Instead of accepting the informative I have to him, he became rude and defensive about his server. It didn't matter of she is good at all other times. For this moment, she was terrible. Do not argue with a customer who had worked multiple years in the serving industry and then stomp away like a child. Very unimpressive and unprofessional.  I didn't care for a free dessert, all I wanted the manager to know and underdressed was that out server need to understand the basics and fundamentals of serving."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order, then it took at least 30 minutes to get our food.  Which was a kids mac and cheese a  greek  salad and at chicken parmesan sandwich.  And with the kids mac and cheese got a fruit salad with Apple's with the seeds still in them. It might a long time before we come back to this place"}
{"text":"Decided to take my wife and family out to one of the newest restaurants in San Tan Valley.  We were seating  fairly quickly, and our waiter came and took our drink order.  When he returned with our drinks he took our food order, which included so appetizers as well.  Both appetizers, potato skins and load steak fries, were still cold in the middle and the cheese on top did not even melt.  Tried to send them back, the returned food was now burnt and way too crispy.  My wife's patty melt came out wrong and burnt as well, she sent it back and the returned one was acceptable.  My wings were okay, but way too greasy for my liking.  The worst part of the evening is when the manager came to check on us and ask us everything was.  My wife responded \"not very good\", and the manager said \"well that's good\" and walked away.  Will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there as you came in there was a banner for advertisement that draped in front of door that wasnt tied down. Customers had to avoid it coming in and going out.Decor could be brightened up. Dark in the bar booth area more than normal.  Dining area was open. Service was fine and we were seated immediately. The food was middle of road.  I had cobb salad and my wife a chicken sandwich. The chicken in my cobb was dry but overall ok but nothing special. My wife's chicken was tender but sauce was very spicey. It was a disappointment since we were expecting a better than average meal. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Check your bill carefully! They will charge you $1.75 for every kids drink even though they are included. If you order the 18 pack of wings, they charge you for a 12 pack and a 6 pack separately, which is more expensive than an 18 pack!  This happens every time I come here, and every time I have to have them fix it before I leave. My bill was almost $10 higher due to these errors. I believe they have to be training servers to ring it up this way and hoping the customer doesn't check before paying. It has happened too many times to be a coincidence."}
{"text":"Slow and apathetic service. The dining room was almost empty on a Saturday night at 8pm. Wings came out ice cold. Very strange.  The manager fixed it.  Our appetizer came out after our food. No explanation. The kids meals are supposed to come with drinks, but she charged us for drinks so we had to have her fix the bill.  No discount asked for, offered or given. I love Native, but this location needs help. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A perfect new year's lunch, hot wings and football!  Its so nice to have a large variety of wing flavors to choose from (Teriyaki ginger & Honey hot today) and the service was attentive without intruding on our conversation.   Ashley made sure we were promptly served and manager Carrie came around regularly to check in and make sure we had everything we needed. Such a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Falcone is so personable and pleasant. Will Def be back in to see him again. Of course the always cold beer is always a plus too :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Not the cleanest place. Always have to ask employee to re clean out seats and table but great atmosphere and fun employees. I recommend the Native Stripper platter, breaded zucchini. zucchini has a great beer battered taste. Happy hours is usually 2-7pm."}
{"text":"For being a new restaurant this location was a bit dirtier than most. I have came numerous times when it was slow and busy.. noone comes to your table for at least 7 minutes and food takes forever. On this particular visit my family and I waited 30 minutes just to get water and ended up getting very dry wings. Wish this was a better location considering it is very close to home."}
{"text":"My fiancé and really enjoy this franchise. Most items are a little pricy but they do have a wide selection of food, desserts, and drinks. Along with a reasonable happy hour. This location has great staff that do their best to accommodate their customers. Unfortunately this restraunt is very dirty just like a lot of the Native Grill and Wing's around the valley."}
{"text":"Wings are good!!!! That's about it. The service needs some help, unfortunately. The burgers are gross. The food in general is blah. I wish I could visit more often but I would not dare visit if it wasn't wing Tuesday- no way, no how."}
{"text":"After a meal of pizza and wings, we thought we'd get some dessert and decaf coffee. The waitress took our order, and came back to let us know they did not have decaf. I bet the manager that told her they weren't going to make a pot of decaf coffee didn't know another person in our party was having another alcoholic drink. Since we couldn't enjoy our dessert with decaf coffee, we canceled the alcohol order and dessert order too. After waiting another 15 minutes (they could have made a bunch of coffee in that time) we were brought a bill with a surprise of $32 in extra wings attached. Then we waited another 15 minutes to get the corrected bill. Just another nail in their coffin. We hadn't been here in a long time, and we probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food and service was horrible. The wings were big and meaty but the sauce on them was old thick gravy. The drinks were watered down. The server was horrible. He was very annoyed to be there waiting on us. Then when he brought the bill, he overcharged us on the margaritas. We were there during happy hour and he charged regular price. We brought it to his attention and he really got an attitude about it. So needless to say his tip reflected his service and the whole dinner experience. We will never be back. Don't ever go there it's horrible."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome always friendly , service is excellent ! Come for lunch once a week and they get out my food promptly, would suggest this location to anyone !!!!"}
{"text":"Sadley we came here this evening with our baseball team. 13 people. They could not sit us inside so we willingly agreed to sit outside 3 hours later we got our dinner. Not to mention 1 1/2 to get drinks. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"1 pound Boneless wings are not a great value.  Felt ripped off.  Service was fine, but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that you do not come here for atmosphere, you come here for the wings.  I was instantly underwhelmed by the lack of decor and atmosphere, as well as eerie silence the moment I stepped inside.  The music was barely audible, it was weird.  The atmosphere and overall decor reminded me of a fast food place.  On the plus side, our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Different from any other wing place I've been to, you have the ability to customize your wings. Extra crispy, extra saucy, whatever you want.  My husband and I were a little grossed out when we received our wings, they looked like they were not fully plucked...BUT because these wings were so delicious and crispy, we were able to look past the furriness."}
{"text":"The bar tender is outstanding. Very attentive and shows interest in his guests. Very happy with the service and will be back. I believe the bar tender is named Dan."}
{"text":"Good cool and refreshing place to hang after a tortuous Senior walk ( from the parking lot to our booth inside NG & W). Senior friendly athmosphere, mild heartburn, and I didn't get dizzy after I ate. Great wait staff , friendly n polite. Be back real soon. See ya tomorrow."}
{"text":"So I know there are mixed reviews on this spot but I'm a regular and absolutely love the place.  Mainly due to the cheap wings on Tuesday and Sunday and the happy hour specials are great. Buffalo chicken nachos for 5 bucks can't be beat. And the staff is amazing every time I go. Pizza is also a winner."}
{"text":"New new new Native has a huge menu but not many experienced staff members. They have an abundant of people now opening the door for you but the great service stops there. Food orders come out randomly, you can't find your server and the food comes and the disappointment in taste and quality hit. The best part of this place is the TVs they added. I would stick with drinks, but plan on waiting for someone to even notice you need another. Come on guys, this spot is so in need of a great sports bar with great food. Still waiting..."}
{"text":"We have a good friend that bowls at Uptown Alley on Thursday evenings and for over a year our group of friends has met on Thursdays for Happy Hour and a bite to eat before he bowls. We started at Uptown Alley's restaurant, and had a love-hate relationship with them that turned more to the latter, so we tried the Native New Yorker for its proximity to the Alley. What we were interested in was a comfortable place to meet and socialize for a couple happy hour drinks and a reasonably priced meal. Speaking for myself, I think it met our simple goals very well.  I was glad that I finally found a place that had more selection than deep-fried this-and-that and was very pleasantly surprised that they could consistently cook to order and deliver in a timely manner something as uncomplicated as a medium-rare burger.  Many restaurants can't seem to do this, and I can't understand why. I love this in combination with their dinner salad in lieu of french fries for 99 cents more. My wife and I have been there at least a half dozen times now, with friends and in the above-mentioned group, and I've never heard a complaint about the food, so, to me, it seems of a consistent good quality.   The service understandably slows during busy times, perhaps a bit more than I can comfortably tolerate, but I was impressed that our server, Nicole, was able to meet our needs in a timely manner without any errors, even though we challenged her by dribbling into the restaurant in one to four person groups as we all arrived separately and paid separately. She delivered accurate checks in a timely manner.  She gets five stars and I'll give the restaurant four for being a bit slower out of the kitchen than I'd accept, for an average of four and one-half, although four is as close as I can come to that rating on Yelp's clickable scale."}
{"text":"This place does it right. Super friendly staff, make you feel at home! Ashley was a great server and nice! Wings are always good. Karaoke at night is cool. Just a friendly feel to this place. Clean too everywhere! Recommend it to anyone that wants good food in a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and this will be the last time. I guess live and learn. We ordered 45 wings and side salad. We got 3 small ranch cups for dipping and salad ?? And absolutely no celery. I guess you can hide bad service with take out boxes. We will be Ordering from the place across the street next time."}
{"text":"For a native new yorker this one is pretty good.  are you looking for a bar to go to after a hockey or football game and don't want to fight the westgate crowd go here.  Prices are similar to most chain restaurants.  Wings are tasty and many different flavors.  Burgers are very good and there is a beer special everyday and not a small beer a big one for 3 bucks cant beat that!.   They have a good wing special on Tuesdays that is just awesome.  I go here for the wings not the best in phoenix but good price and served fresh not dry like some places or over fried."}
{"text":"We came here because we wanted to try the Strawberry Hot wings specifically. Our server was awesome. She was friendly, attentive, and even encouraged me to download the restaurant app to get a free order of wings! We ordered the Strawberry Hot and Honey Hot wings. Bone in of course! The Strawberry Hot wings were ok, not very hot at all though in my opinion. The taste reminded me of wings that someone poured jam onto. Next time I'm going to try a different flavor, like the Spicy Honey Mustard."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband had two servers randomly switch on us. Not a big problem probably change of shift. Our problem was that the second server didn't introduce herself. She was more attentive to the guys next to us. Would come and go without asking if we needed anything practically left the food and walked off. Waited forever and a day to get a refill and no the restaurant was not busy as it was a monday in the afternoon with plenty of other staff. Had plenty of food left over. Had to look for her to ask for a couple of boxes. Brings a small box. We ask again takes 10 minutes doesn't get the hint we would like our bill of course we ask and she still manages to take another 20 minutes. Maybe she was having a bad day but if so why pay more attention to the group of 3 guys next to us? And why chat around with the rest of the servers texting around? Food wasn't too bad it was nice and hot will come back to try again. The GM was nice and courteous enough to address the issue as he asked for feedback and worked on the service matter diligently."}
{"text":"we eat there a few times a month, average  food but usually good service. wings are good."}
{"text":"It would appear this location has closed down. Drove by this evening and the place was in darkness."}
{"text":"Came in just for some wings they were just what. I needed at the moment service was great and we were sat immediately nice peaceful vist as no games were going on at the time"}
{"text":"New Ownership Is Nice...Food Was Good And Service Was On Point...  But Move Karaoke To Tuesday..."}
{"text":"I like wings. I like big fat wings. I like dry rubs and I like sauces. I really like dry rubs. I like lots of options!  I like trying different flavors. All my likes I can find here. Ok. Maybe not big and fat wings. But they are not the small ones you find in 65% of the wing places, so that is a good thing!    We ordered 2 flavors. Ancho Chile Lime DRY RUB (yay) Cool lime with a bite of chile!  And Habanero Mango.  Both fully cooked. A nice crisp to the outside. Hey!  That is good!  I would not say they were bursting with flavor. However they were enjoyed (and definitely not bland).   Others ordered a build your own flat bread. They enjoyed it. There is a gluten free menu. I am told there were only meat options on it.   Someone orders boneless wings (I really do not understand why but they did). So as odd as that sounds, they offer that too. As well as salads etc etc.   Place was clean. Lots of TVs (sports bar). Ample parking. Staff was friendly. Service was good."}
{"text":"Any other native is better than this one. Bad service and bad food 4 times in a row. I'm close to this one so I keep giving them a chance but after today I'm done. They are so bad at something so easy, beer and wings. Half moon bay or zipps are much better."}
{"text":"Been here four times total and was never impressed with anything about it food wasn't that great service was only OK and when I found wax paper underneath my pizza That's where I draw the line. Maybe another day I'll feel like going here but until then I only give it one star"}
{"text":"Wow.  I consider myself a bit of a wing-snob and found this place almost by accident. I regret not finding this place sooner as I frequent wing places often.  The ability to completely customize your wings to suit your taste is really what sets this place apart from the rest, in addition to the flavor. I like my wings extra crispy and extra saucy and this place definitely delivers on that front. Of all of the flavors, the Parmesan Asiago wings cooked extra crispy was my favorite. We also tried the salt and pepper (taste exactly as you expect), the ginger (average), and the medium (awesome, but a bit too spicey for me). You can also order drumstick only, wing only, or a mix, so order as you see fit.  It is a little pricey, but they do have dine-in specials on wing-night, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! We have actually gone here several times and the last 2 times have been a no go. After yesterday's visit, never again. The waitress was awesome but the food got my family sick. We ordered their Family feast meal. XL cheese pizza, 2lb of wings and salad. My 3 children from ages 2-8 only ate the pizza and my husband ate pizza and wings and I only ate salad and a few wings. Needless to say the pizza gave my family food poising or they did something because last night my 6 year old started vomiting, then my 2 year old and then my husband and 8 year old this morning. I know it was their food. GROSS and pissed!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since '06 and they still won't stock MGD. If it wasn't for the friendly staff and a few managers I would drink elsewhere .oh and the piped in music is horrible. Should of kept the juke box. Beer is over priced."}
{"text":"Bad food,, very slow service. Did I say over priced. Save your money eat somewhere else. .basic hamburger taste bad. How does this place stay in business."}
{"text":"I have just one complaint here...  The 'Native Puffs' appetizer was the 2nd worst app I ever had. A trail of sludge on the serving platter was very noticeable, as I slid the puff over to my dish.  But I didn't find any BP slush fund here to compensate my queasy stomach.  And the filling was comprised of nasty canned processed cheese.  The manager said he would give these to us at happy hour pricing, but that promise didn't make it to the check.  Now on to the good stuff.  Their pizza rocked!  The crust was perfectly crisp, the sauce was seasoned to my taste, and the toppings were spot on.  Their wings were deep fried perfectly.  I just love the honey-hot flavor.  Our server was very attentive (and his station was slammed), and the manager (and some other friendly employee) came over to check on us, telling us about an upcoming free wing special.  Even when one of the other server's bumped my arm as he walked by, he made a point to get my attention to apologize. (Results not typical)  They have $3.00 22oz domestic tap for happy hour.  Boo Native Puffs. Hooray Beer!  PS. I agree with Richard.  Try Blue 32!"}
{"text":"I'M SO HAPPY FOOTBALL SEASON IS HERE!  and i practically live here... at native ny'er.  no, i'm not a regular here because this is the best sports bar in town... and no, it's not because they have amazing food or anything.  it just happens to be located across the street from where i live, and tragically (yes, tragically) arizona NEVER televises my NINERS or GIANTS games, so i'm forced to set up camp here like some deranged sports lunatic.   i can only imagine what the staff thinks of me. i've shown up with my 2 yr old nephew in tow, with out of town friends, my brother, a gaggle of girlfriends, a rowdy group of guy friends, even a date or two. i even stopped in once by myself because i HAD to see the NY jets/eagles preseason game on my lap top. (yes, i bought the Preseason Pass on NFL.com, soooo worth it) i probably could have watched the game on my lap top at home, but didn't want to.  so here's my take on their food. it's bar food. it does the job. the wings are too bready, but the beer is always cold. the bartenders are the best of the best. i forget his name, but one of the bartenders is really hilarious. he tells the funniest stories and always remembers exactly what i drink. bonus points for a heavy pour.  and the best part... besides that it's cave-like dark and has about a million massive TV's? the arctic-blasting air conditioning! is always turned WAY UP. seriously, on a 112 degree day, it feels like heaven. they do have a nice patio area with misters, but it's still been way too hot to sit out there. perhaps now with the temps dropping and fall approaching, the patio will be a great place to watch games. we'll see.  yeah so, if you're ever looking for me and can't seem to find me, odds are i'll be here. at the bar. like some crazed sports chick, clutching my beer and yelling at the TV.  ok this review must come to an abrupt end. the patriots/bengals game is starting, i gotta go. GO PATS!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Good food and people.  But watch out for the lettuce. Whether it is a garnish or a part of an assembled sandwich, the lettuce is always sad, brown, and looks like the bad part of Steve Buscemi's teeth."}
{"text":"Service has been great the last two times I have been here. I always order the strawberry hot wings. They are delicious and you will not regret trying them. It sounds like an odd flavor, but be adventurous and reap the rewards. Found that this place is also a great place to keep up with the World Cup. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Terrible all around. I love native New Yorker. I figured they were all the same. Boy was I wrong. We came to watch the World Cup and eat some wings/drink a few drinks. After arriving we were not super hungry yet, and with it being 110 degrees outside all we wanted was water. We sat down ordered a couple waters for the time being and planned to order food/drinks after cooling down a bit.  Instantly the waitress asked for both ID's (which I could understand since we were in the bar area) and then immediately said she needed a debit card. I asked why, considering we had only ordered water, and her reply was that she needed it cause people run out on their tab consistently and that they were understaffed so they wouldn't be able to watch us well. The main problem I had with this is that we hadn't even ordered anything yet! It made us feel very alienated and like criminals for just sitting down. I have never been treated this way in a restaurant. Needless to say I will never return to this location. Management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers. The location I usually go to we typically spend around $100 between 3 or 4 ppl during World Cup games and we always make it a point to overtip the wait staff. I ordered one beer here and that's it. I probably would have ordered more but the waitress seemed to be ignoring us probably for the fact that we originally ordered just water and she assumed we weren't going to order anything else. Again, I love Native New Yorker, but this place needs to get there stuff together. Hire more staff rather than making customers feel like criminals!"}
{"text":"Pretty Average.  I came here for the first time for lunch. It looked like your average American restaurant similar to BJs/Applebees/etc. I was surprised to see that they had lunch specials: $7 for a burger and fries and ~$10 for a dozen wings. Not a bad deal, too bad the food was just okay.   The burger was small and average. The fries needed more seasoning. One person could finish the entire meal and still be hungry. I ordered 6 BBQ and 6 Honey Hot. The wings were so small and had such little meat, but maybe I'm just used to my plump hormone injected wings. The taste was alright, nothing exciting. Though I will recommend the Honey Hot - sweet with a very VERY mild kick.   Kudos to our server (I didn't catch his name :( ) but he was AMAZING! He served us with a smile on his face, very cheerful, and helpful. Made the experience a lot more enjoyable.  Environment: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is average. The wings are a little small and kind of bland, but they have good prices, and a couple nights a week, really good specials on food/drink. Beers are big and cold, lots of TV's to watch sports. The place is split into two sides so if you have family or kids you can sit on the restaurant side and if you are with your buddies ready to cheer for the game and crush beers, you can sit on the bar side. Good service, attentive wait staff, good apps. Good to go if you don't have plans and want to watch a game as it is a bit under the radar."}
{"text":"Great food great service and as always great wings!!! Recommend to anyone !  They have an amazing happy hour and delicious drinks .... Yummy"}
{"text":"If you feel like waiting 15 minutes for your refills, not getting your appetizer before your meal, 40 minutes for your check, another 15 minutes for your credit card slip to sign to leave then this is the place for you. I had to get up from my table twice to find my waiter and I am a patient person.  This place is the worst and I will NOT be going back! I still tipped the waiter because it's not his fault, management is and they are not on top of it. I witnessed waitresses and waiters chitchatting and 3 hostesses standing around while they could be helping. My bill was over a hundred dollars and I feel like I was ripped off for such bad service."}
{"text":"Pretty nice atmosphere and good wings. I grew up going to a different location and wanted to try them again since it has been a while. I ordered 2 dozen wings for take out. They were hot and tasty although I prefer mine with more sauce. Next time I will order extra sauce. Everything was in time and tastes great."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan.   We went here on the first night of our excursion to see our Eagles get plucked by the Cardinals last weekend.  My brother wanted to watch the UFC fights and found out this place gets the PPVs.   We each paid a $5 cover charge which didnt seem too bad and sat on the patio as the inside was packed.  It was very hot out and their misting system was a little shaky all night.   When they finally got it turned on after a short while, mist (well, we all hope it was mist) came out pouring over all of us and our drinks.  My dad questioned whether it was mist or dust as the system seemed somewhat antiquated.  A short period of time later the system started emanating HEAT from it, which was about the last thing any of us needed, like running up to someone who was drowning and throwing a brick at them for good measure.  My brother ended up climbing up and disconnecting the heat plug under supervision of another employee, which the possibilities caused me to have flashbacks to my Business Law college courses.  I ordered a club sandwich with no cheese since I didn't want to start my vacation on an upset stomach.  Upon the delivery the waitress repeated the order as she handed me my plate of food \"One club sandwich with no cheese\"    30 seconds later I was picking cheese off of each and every quarter of it.   Even more annoying, sometimes I'd peel of the cheese and have to HUNT for the meat.   I kid you not, one of them had maybe half of an average SLICE of turkey on it.  THAT'S IT.   So there was bread, lettuce, tomato, unwanted cheese, and half a slice of turkey.   If you've seen me you know I don't look like Fiona Apple, so I'd like more than 2-3 slices of meat TOTAL on my sandwich please.  The fries were okay (I substituted the steak fries for curly), but nothing you can't get elsewhere.  The only saving grace for the experience was the waitress who was extremely friendly, efficient, and refilled the drinks constantly.  Prices were average unless you consider that club sandwich probably had $.75 worth of fixings, and I'm certain it cost more than that.  1 star for the food, bumped up to a 2 for the service."}
{"text":"When I lived in Glendale I went to every Cardinals game. The bar is fun on sundays! It's definitely  bar food though. A year later I came back and the bartenders remembered our names! All the servers are awesome. They recently changed their wings so they are battered and even better (really big though). I love this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time tonight. Seemed like a decent place, the hostess said we could sit outside and that she'd have someone bring us menus. Someone did, sort of. The waiter(? I actually have no idea because he didn't bother to introduce himself) literally threw a couple menus on our table and turned and walked away. My date thought he said \"bye\" as he walked away and he must of meant it be cause that was the last time anyone talked to us or made eye contact. Although a handful employees came out to the nearly empty patio, and one even smoked a vape pen with a friend nobody helped us or acknowledged that we were there. 45 minutes later we left. Screw this place and its horrible service. (I've never felt compelled to write a review like this ever, I'm a laid back guy - but seriously this was annoying)."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, no wait for a table on a Saturday evening was nice.  server was  distracted by another table and spent his time visiting with them after 45 min manager and another server finally brought out a plate of cold wings and the rest of the order server stopped by to check up and was asked for more ranch but didn't return for 15 minutes still with no ranch. Pizza was as expected a spatula to serve it would have been nice.   staff was smoking in front of the door of the restaurant talking loudly using  very profane language.   If you have 45 minutes to wait for mediocre food and enjoy not being bothered by the staff it would be the perfect spot"}
{"text":"We love the Gilbert location ,  and seriously amazed at how much different each location is..   Tried,  guadalupe n dobson, Gilbert n Germann,  and now Alma School and QC..    Food,  was ok.  wings decent,  but chikn tasted a little off.  the crunch n sauce was good tho...  guessing not freshest wings but..  ok...  Seasoned French fries were the best items,  n wife had the Chicken strip combo.   also ehhh..  but them Fries...  If popeyes wasn't across the street,  we might be back just for fries.. lol,  but not kidding..   maybe monsoon season,  but carpet seemed sticky,  like a movie theater..  then the tables too,  thought it might be the normal texture,  but noticed near corners table smooth plastic laminate..  Center area all sticky almost leathery..   Bar side looked a lot cleaner than family side..   needless to say,  we will only be going back to the Gilbert location if we are in the area.."}
{"text":"Great place and had awesome service.  I'm not too sure about the layout but i think its laid out for more of a family restaurant and not for a local bar.  I'm used to Native New Yorker separating the bar and the restaurant side, but the way they have it set up will get the job done.  The one thing i was not a big fan of was the super small patio.  There was only room for a couple tables."}
{"text":"Ok, haven't been here since they remodeled and had BAD service 4 years ago... Changes made and tried again..  Ambiance and the new layout was pretty nice.. Definitely have enough items on Tap as well. Staff were super busy for the UFC fight, but kept up with the orders, and the food orders were coming out, quick, almost too quick, like wait,,,  ..   We had the Buffalo/Ranch dry rub wings n they were great.. Will be back now that improvements have been made and staff were all friendly.. (def better than Native on Alma n QC) Kudos !!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but they need to revamp their menu.  Gave only 3 stars due to boring choices. If you want hot Wing sauce that is actually hot, go for the ghost pepper sauce, all the rest are barely hot or the heat is nonexistent or masked with sweet.  Pizza is decent but expensive.  Salads are small for $9.  Ok place to eat, service has been a lot better over past few months.  If you are in the area its really the only good place to eat other than Federicos."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful . Cody was our server. The BEST Cobb salad I've had anywhere! My husband got the Bacon Cheeseburger and he loved it too. So then we needed the most delicious chocolate chip warm cookie with Ice Cream. Loved it all"}
{"text":"The wings always come out fast and hot.  Great service , cheapest beer around. I recommend the dry rub asiago or chicken and waffle wings.  Amazing.  Also ghost sauce is perfect of you like hot"}
{"text":"They have good prices. Wine is good. The environment here is much nicer than the one at Gilbert and 60. Clearly newer. However, I do like food better at Gilbert and 60. Some of my friends like this one better though. It is definitely a better atmosphere to sit and chat in. They have lots of tvs and big cozy booths. My staff and I come here for happy hours and my boss likes to meet here. They definitely have a better handle on excessive noise than Mesa location."}
{"text":"Good food. Good value! Got honey hot wings boneless. Waitress was nice and quick. Wine was good. Good times with good friends. Nice big tvs. I'll be back. The booths could use some repairs."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Currently here right now writing my review. There is food at every single table and not one person has cleaned it. There is also a homeless guy inside and eating left over food and sleeping in the booth. Our server even looks like a drug attic"}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, but I just can't seem to have an enjoyable experience at this place.  Great spot to stop for a quick beer, but other than that the food isn't good, the service is very sub par, and the bar area is to small and crowded. Some renovations might do this place some justice."}
{"text":"You can smell cigarette smoke while waiting to be seated. My wife's salad was watery and brown. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Got the Buffalo Ranch Twists and wings: barbecue hot flavor and Asian Garlic. Really good!  Bud light on tap $3 bucks! Service has been great!  Quick to check on me!  When I told the waitress it was my first time she pulled up a chair a chatted with me about the menu! The only negative is that I'm sitting outside and so are the smokers. ..ughhh.  Ashley is awesome!  Checked on me multiple times;  the RIGHT way!  Business brought me here but I'll DEFINITELY be back! Took away a star because of the smoke situation but other that great experience!  Football,  beer,  wings,  outside and 67 degrees in Phoenix. ...doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch today and must say we had a pleasant dining experience here. Staff was very friendly knowledgable of specials and drinks to try. Our food came out in a timely manner, didn't wait long. Our appetizers came BEFORE the meal which is great since some places bring em out at the same time as the main course which defeats the purpose of ordering appetizers in the first place. The restaurant was clean and our glasses were never empty and we didn't have to ask for them to come by when we needed something she came by frequently to check on us. This will be our go to Native New Yorker from now on and so close to the house! Very happy with checked this location out!"}
{"text":"Restaurant; clean and always quick for seating.  Service; I have been several times and always friendly.  Food; Traditional wings are my favorite, asiago extra crispy. Beverages always cold."}
{"text":"Great traditional wings and strippers. Tried a bunch of flavors; buffalo ranch, strawberry hot, salt & vinegar, honey mustard, and honey hot. Honey hot was my favorite. Onion rings were good as well as the loaded tater tots. Also highly recommend the habanero iced tea mocktail! My mom enjoyed the huge side salad and service in the bar by Leon was great. Highly satisfied!!"}
{"text":"The wings are great... so stick with just the wings. The pizzas are decent. Don't go with burgers or spaghettis... they are no good even by Phoenix standards."}
{"text":"$26 plus tax, definitely not worth it.  Just a bunch of small sad wimpy wings.  Won't be ordering from here anymore."}
{"text":"The service was great, especially from our server, Katie. Friendly, funny, and outgoing staff. Food is amazing there! 'Till next time!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings good selection of beers nice atmosphere bartenders were knowledgeable and fast don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Gold standard service!  Seated right away,  staff friendly and happy,  order taken in a reasonable time.   Well run establishment, should be the template for the other locations. Plates, silverware, napkins all brought without having to request it. This will be our go to place even if it's a little farther than the one by our house."}
{"text":"Waiting for 15 min now and NO ONE acknowledges us. No wait staff, or bartender, NO ONE.   Less than 15 people in the bar....this is ridiculous.  Seriously need to hire a manager or staff that wants to work.   Leaving and never returning.  EVER!"}
{"text":"So I dropped by this Native New Yorker for a quick bite since my local favorite hang Old Chicago, closed down. I ordered a Bronx Calzone (again missing Old Chicago's) and well... don't bother ordering those here. I swear that the ingredients used were merely packaged cold cuts from a grocery store. However, the service was excellent!!! **Native New Yorker; quit attempting to sell raffle tickets to your poatrons while they are dining and start paying more attention to the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Native is one of my favorite places to go for wings, but this location is absolutely disgusting. A health inspector should go by there asap. My girlfriend and I walked into there today and a stench wall of raw sewage. We immediately asked if they could smell it and they simply stated, \"oh, there's been a stench from the bathroom for a few days.  We are trying to get someone to come look at it soon.\"  The fact that they are cooking food while there is fecal matter floating through the air is completely unsanitary. It wasn't just a small hint of it either. It was like being smack in the face with a dirty diaper. Gross."}
{"text":"Please never bring this chain to Northern California! The wings here are just about average, but nothing much to write home about.  The margarita pizza was just plain bland! Honestly I don't know what they could do differently to make it better. I feel like they warmed up a frozen pizza for our table.  I saw other entrees on tables across from me and I couldn't get excited about them either. Ugh I couldn't even figure out the theme of it was a sports bar or just a local hangout? I'll never stop here again for mediocre!"}
{"text":"Really good happy hour! Both for food and drinks. The service is good too. Lots of nice tvs in the bar area. Come football season id imagine this is A great spot to watch. Overall good experience going here."}
{"text":"THE BEST HOT WINGS!  Wings do not get better than Native New Yorker!  The honey hot are awesome and the hot buffalo is great as well!  Great service, cold beer, good food.  The patio area is nice too!  It's nice to seat at the bar near sun set when they have the big garage doors open.  Cool place."}
{"text":"Went with my friend to this location last week. I won't go back at least not to this location. We were seated at a booth 10 minutes go by no server came. So we got up went to the bar hoping we'd get service there. A few minutes go by there we ask for water and a beer. We only get a beer. We are like I guess this is progress. Then we had to ask for menus. The bartender wasn't there. About 15 min go by and another gentleman came by, I politely asked him if we could order some food. He took the order finally. We got our food. Wings were dry, asked for more sauce and that took another 10 min to get. Granted the male bartender was faster but the service was still poor. We shouldn't have to wait that long for service especially when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a fun sports bar and Restaurant with very good food and good service:)"}
{"text":"This location is awful! I used to go here and food was good it slowly started to go south so I stopped going. The other day I decided to give it another try heck it has been at least 4 years maybe they have improved?  BAD idea!! They have since tore down the wall that provided a the little bit of privacy it had to have a now open disorganized café look. Service was horrible and the food was disgusting and way overpriced. The only good part was my beer. Will not give another chance this place needs to just be a bar. Maybe use the dining area portion as a dance floor."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this location. Our party had to ask to be served, the bar was unequipped with basic ingredients, management was very rude, servers were incompetent, we had to ask multiple times for water, and our drinks were basically water with a splash of mixer. I love Native, but this location leaves MUCH to be desired. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Native wings rock they are one of my favorite places in the valley as they have a great variety and always are great.  Last night I went to go watch the BCS Championship game and get some wings and they had a pizza special $6.99 for a 14\" cheese pie so we got that too.  All the food was great and the game was on every tv along with ample volume.  Overall a great time and great food.  Thanks Native"}
{"text":"The first time I tried the Lemon Pepper wings they were awesome. I ordered a larger wing platter the next day and was slightly disappointed. I guess it depends on the cook. a little pricey but decent size wings.. good flavors."}
{"text":"Well, everything I read about this place isn't true. The wings were good, the salad was fresh, the beer was cold and service was great. I like the fact that they are all over Arizona and they have a good lunch menu. The app is easy to use and I have no complaints. This is a great local sports bar with an amazing selection of wings. The outdoor patio works well with water misters. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The bar of this place is the part you need to hang out in if you go here. The front dining area is lame so i was hesitant to even go in the back and check out the bar.  However, i was rather surprised. Nice big area..with a crap load of t.v's.   Good happy hour prices. B/f tried about 6 different kinds of the wings(the day we went each wing was 39 cents) they have all different kinds of sauces, hot, strawberry, garlic, orange etc.. he was not that impressed with them(he eats a lot of wings, sl his expectations are just a little high) i thought they were alright. the pizza was however, very good..better than the wings.  i will be back..cool spot to catch a game and grab a drink."}
{"text":"Okay just FYI I'm not normally a guy to complain, send food back, or ask to speak with a manager, but I am today. I've ate at Native in Goodyear, Surprise, and Buckeye (this one). I live in Buckeye and have eaten here a few times. The wings and Frys are very good, but on my last occasion I sent my wife's food back due to poor quality all onion chicken wrap, today we sent her salad back due to frozen lettuce, my son had the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich and the bun was burnt black. I asked for a manager who apologized, offered a desert which I declined and told her I wouldn't be returning. We ordered a philly cheese steak to replace the salad which was taken off my bill. My wife couldn't eat the Philly Cheese either due to being overly seasoned with black pepper. A comp wasn't offered and honestly I didn't ask, because I'm not a guy who is looking to complain to get a free meal. I just want to warn others if your going for wings, you'll be fine, anything else and your taking a risk. Go to Goodyear or Surprise if you want to visit Native as I've had better experiences there."}
{"text":"Jon is seriously my favorite!!! After my interview I was stressed and she reassured me that I was golden and unlike other bartenders she made sure I was fine and talked me through my anxiety. Amazing service, definitely talk to jon if you're having a hard day or need advice. Haven't had this experience ever I felt at home."}
{"text":"10/2916 Accidentally found this great wings restaurant.  Good food, good ambience and great service. Except for the fact it was a little expensive,  we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of good looking stuff but this place is known for wings but if your into hot wings wouldn't want to come here for these reasons but besides that there's a lot of great looking stuff"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for food, asked for extra napkins 3 times, never refilled water without flagging them down. 2 entrees didn't come out with their full items. Restaurant was not close to full, there were three servers. Also way too many TVs."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd favorite place to go for wings, but thankfully the closest to our home so we go there often.  Great atmosphere and nice place to grab some pizza as well."}
{"text":"I went to Native with my husband and mother-in-law. We ordered wings and a calzone. The service was alright, but the food was fantastic. Our favorite wasthe strawberry hot wings."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!  My mom has been at our house for a week, and surprisingly, we hadn't gone out to lunch yet during the time she has been here.  I wanted to get out of the house today and try something new.  Low carb options had to be in the mix, so we decided to come on down here to Native Grill & Wings.  Some coworkers had mentioned it before and claimed that they had really good wings.  We would soon find out.............  We parked in the lot, walked in and was greeted right away.  We were shown to our table and browsed over the menu.  Tuesdays, they have \"wing day\" where you can get $.59 cent wings (with purchase of a drink).  Not bad, not bad at all!  I went with 12 wings, extra crispy (salt and pepper & medium), and a diet Coke.  My mom went with 12 wings (teriyaki ginger & honey bbq) and a Coke.  After we placed our order, we sat there for awhile. This is the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars.  The restaurant was not busy at all, but it still took a good 25 minutes for us to get our food.  A table that ordered right before us (seriously, like 2 minutes before us...same waitress), got their meal and was mostly done by the time ours came out.  For a delay that long, I was hoping that the food would be fantastic.  Thankfully, it was!  Here is how everything panned out..............  Salt and Pepper Wings-  These things were fantastic!  My 2 favorite wing places that I have ever had were Anchor Bar in Buffalo (For Christs sake, its the place where Buffalo wings originated!), and Golden Chopsticks salt and pepper wings in National City (Crack wings...if you ever go to San Diego, look this place up and go there just for the wings!).  These wings were up there as some of the best I have ever had.  They were extremely crispy, seasoned perfectly, piping hot and pretty big, too!  If I have a Golden Chopsticks withdrawal in the future, I know where I will be headed.  These salt and pepper wings were great!  I will definitely get them again!  Medium Wings-  These were also fantastic!  Crispy, crunchy, moist in the middle, perfectly sauced, just hot enough to make you sweat just a bit etc.  I'm not the biggest buffalo sauce fan in the world, but this sauce and these wings were great!  Definitely a repeat order!   My mom really liked her wings, too!  Each order of 6 wings came with a ranch dipping sauce as well as a few pieces of celery.   Service was fantastic!  Our waitress was extremely kind and all smiles.  At one point during our meal, she came over and told me and my mom, \"You guys are nice!\".  Not sure if she had some angry/irate customers earlier,  or what?  lol.  She refilled beverages without having to ask, checked on us a few times during our stay, and even offered us a \"to go\" soda on our way out (rare...haven't seen that too often in CA or AZ..saw it on nearly every meal down South in Alabama and Louisiana a few years back.  Anyways....).    Besides the slight wait for our food, everything else was fantastic!  These wings are awesome and the price can't be beat.  For 24 wings and 2 sodas, it was only a little over $21.00!  I know I will be back sooner than later.  Low carb, great food, and cheap prices?  Sign me up for possibly every Tuesday going forward ;-)."}
{"text":"Very good wings, and quite cheap. Pretty good service but sometimes can slack. Overall good place. Come back here almost every Thursday."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some food and a cold drink. Waited at the bar for 10 minutes while staff walked around 'looking busy'. No one looked at me or asked if I wanted anything. Bad customer service and rude employees is why this place is pretty empty for a Friday. Upper management must wonder why this location is underperforming compared to other Native locations. Btw I left after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"For what it is, this Native is fine. Wings needed more sauce, and they brought some out. It was clean and our server was nice. It is a fine place to come when you want wings. I get the honey hots. It's not amazing, but there was nothing terrible about it either."}
{"text":"I really like their honey hot wings.  My four stars is based on that.  I'm not a big fan of their service in the afternoon at lunch time.  It can take a while, and I'm usually there on my lunch hour, so I'm not looking for a leisurely lunch.  I haven't tried anything else.  I just like the wings."}
{"text":"This is my second time going with the same issue. Cooks suck ass at making food. Servers are great. I order strippers and get boneless wings instead, again this is the 2 bad time in a row going here. I don't know if the cooks play Legos in the back or cook food for its consumers. Best part about it! I told the server it was the wrong order.... But that I'll take it for how it is... And she walked away. Came back and she's like I know you said you just wanted to keep the one you have but I brought a new one just for you. I look down it's a whole different color! Lol! I ordered Asian garlic it was like a BBQ color and she brought strippers with mandarin orange flavor....lmao.... I know she knew they screwed up again because she looked at my normal dish and made a double take with the dish she brought out. And walked away!!! Lmao!!! These cooks seriously suck so bad!!!"}
{"text":"We've literally been coming here for 8+ years. For a time, we would go every Friday and sit in Josh's section. He was awesome and trained the other servers. Everyone was amazing and attentive. It was ALWAYS packed and had a great neighborhood feel. For the last couple years, it's gone steadily downhill. The fire only exacerbated that. The new space is cold and awkward ... We've switched to takeout. Tonight's tater tots and wings were overcooked, the marinara tasted burned and the food overall wasn't great. They're clearly struggling to find their way. Too many other choices out there. Not sure we'll be back anytime soon. Sad that this family tradition has faded away."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports with tons of giant tvs everywhere. The wings are a little small for my liking but you can order them in any quantity and they have a great variety of flavors to choose from. The other main dishes are what you expect, not out of the park but not disappointing either. The menu has a good variety of different dishes to choose from, so you can usually find something to hit the spot. Staff are always friendly and accommodating. Parking can get tough when there is a big game, so be prepared to park across or down the street and walk a bit. Not a big deal just try and avoid the dumpsters, they can be gag inducingly bad."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit to a Native store and tonight gave me reason to assure its another long while before I'll be coming back.   I've been craving wings all week so when I passed this place, it was perfect timing and meant to be. My choice of seating was at the bar, since I was alone. The bar tender, George, while polite, reminded me of a recently released inmate with his teardrop tattoo and over use of the phrase \"Boss-Man\" to each patron.   My food was delivered by a runner, who repeated my order out loud to assure it was correct while placing it in front of me. I should have taken a picture of the plate as it appeared the chef was saving the Honey Haberñero sauce for someone else's order. These wings were Sahara Desert dry.  Not only dry but extremely over cooked. The celery appeared as if it had been used by an angry sous chef as there was not one piece which did not look like bad split ends on over processed hair.   Thank goodness for the luck of a random stranger at the bar to talk to and a nice glass of tea to wash it all down.   The bar tender reappeared at my end to deliver the check which was quickly paid for an expedited departure. Never once was I checked on to assure that my order was correct or tasted OK.  I'm never one to send food back and reorder as an insult to the chef will not always work out in a positive way  Bottom line?  There are hundreds of places out there I will go to first before ever setting foot here again."}
{"text":"We got \"loaded\" tots....does this look loaded?  This is sad.  Don't take the description seriously"}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour. Not much selection of beer and the place does get packed. Try the flat bread and their great selection of wings."}
{"text":"Great food and service, can't go wrong with the wings. Took the fam on a Sunday afternoon, quick service and good atmosphere. Will return again."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 3 times to make sure they got a fair shake. The food here is terrible and the quality is a shade of what Native used to be able to offer. If you want good wings you will have to drive out of Santan Valley. Try Wingstop or ATL and you will be much happier. This Native really seems to have poor quality and a lack of management."}
{"text":"Nice patio to sit at,But Sit is all your going to be doing. Good luck on getting served ! .     I think next Time im going to get A Burger At Red Robin right next to the Patio"}
{"text":"First time here since it reopened and it's totally different in a good way.   I was a big party and they brought us appetizers on the house."}
{"text":"Was suggested by my hotel; was told it would be the quickest option.  57 minutes later, I had a cold pizza, in the wrong size and a warm salad.  I had specifically ordered the 14\" pizza so I would have leftovers for the next day.  Thankfully, it was the smaller size since it had sat in the box for a very long time before delivered; as it was soggy. The Greek salad at $10 was extremely overpriced for the size that arrived.  The flatbread served with the salad was hard and stale."}
{"text":"We've been here more than we should of-trying to support local.  Enough is enough- servers are unfriendly, waited for everything but each came with an excuse. Didn't smile, didn't apologize but rolled her eyes.  Need to get better help!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times not really expecting much. We actually had planned on another restaurant but the wait was insane. So we decided to go here which had no wait. We know why now. As we sat we noticed how dirty the floor was under our table and others. After we sat I pulled up yelp and was shocked to see all the bad reviews but we ordered anyways. I had the honey hot strippers and my wife had the lettuce wraps. Food was ok. I also ordered a side salad which they forgot. Our waiter was very friendly but seemed a bit overwhelmed as we overheard him apologizing for other mistakes the Kitchen had made. As we left we were ignored by the 2 hostesses looking at there phones. Overall I'd pass on the place. Food is mediocre and the service is sub par. Better options available for sure."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would. Every time i eat here i have the worst experience.  My husband and i took our three young sons here for dinner last night around 830pm. The place was dirty i just couldn't believe it. The waitress was extremely rude ignored us most of the time. The food was fine nothing amazing. Will be the last time ill be taking my family their."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to get wings and drinks. Great customer service. Alexis was attentive and our iced teas never dropped below halfway. Wings were cooked perfectly and tasted great."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service && so poorly managed. Somebody who knows what they are doing needs to come In and clean house!!!"}
{"text":"Wings in Buffalo aren't usually breaded. I can't stand breaded Buffalo wings. The sauces were good, I can't deal with the breading. The redeemer for this place is that they serve Roast Beef on Kimmelweck. I did not try it, I am sure it was decent though."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this location on a Thursday evening and sat in the bar area. The bartender was very nice and checked on us frequently to make sure we always had a drink in hand. We ordered several wings, personal pizza, dinner salad and chicken strippers.   Flavors my husband and I are fans of include: salt & pepper, simple and satisfying; ancho chile lime, surprisingly addictive; spicy honey mustard, my personal favorite, and mango habanero, for those who love the heat! I do love all the options available for wings, the option of having \"naked\" wings to be a little healthier and how you can mix and match sliders and other options.   All was good, but many of our wings were plain without any sauce. It also seemed our dry rub wings contained heavy rub but our sauces were very dry. Unfortunately after we ordered our food, we rarely got checked on and had to look out for our server or the bartender to get any additional water or napkins. Overall, still a fan and will visit again."}
{"text":"Have visited here three or four times.  Great food every time.  Busy and sometimes the staff gets overwhelmed because it's ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES IN SAN TAN VALLEY to grab a beer, game and great food.  The staff does a great job."}
{"text":"Usually always go to this location on Tuesday for wing Tuesday, but their quality has gone down by a lot.  This has been my goto place for wings on Tuesday, but I am getting tired of receiving under sized, dried out and tasteless wings.  It seems like they are using stale chicken wings and and repurpose them.  Aren't you supposed to provide the customer a fresh batch of wings instead of undersized and dried out wings?    I am thinking about not coming here anymore.  Also, service is ridiculously slow and we had to wait 30 mins to get ketchup after asking numerous times."}
{"text":"The service could have been a better and this is coming from someone pretty empathetic with service professionals. It was taking a long time for our drink orders to show up, but our server was very friendly. The food was alright. I'll certainly be giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Food was ok we had the wings but I must say the service was really bad. I don't think our waitress looked at us once.  Felt like we were a bother by asking what the specials were. Idk if I'd go back. Service was just really subpar."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a craving for wings, so we decided to go to Native. Dave was our waiter, and I have to say he was awesome. Great service and very friendly.  We will definitely ask for him when we come back. Thank you Dave for the excellent service. :)"}
{"text":"I like their food menu but the service wasn't great and their happy hour was seriously lacking selection! Nothing was very clear and our waitress seemed as though it was the worst day of her life and waiting on us was the cherry on top. My girlfriends and I won't be going back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great happy hour items and prices! Fast and friendly staff too!  Favorites were: fried zucchini, curly fries, honey hot wings,  asian  garlic wings, mandarin orange wings, onion rings. Asiago Parmesan wings were okay, probably wouldn't get them again though.   Not so favorites: Strawberry hot wings (too sweet), Salt and pepper wings (way too much salt!), mozarella sticks.   I like that they serve everything on metal plates, even if you get one or two of each flavor... but it does take up a lot of table space.   Will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is a marketing issue but being a born-and-raised New Yorker I'm slightly offended they took off the \"New Yorker\" from their name. Nonetheless, the place is great, decently priced, nice atmosphere, great location and the food is delicious and well presented."}
{"text":"The food was good as it should be, but on a \"not so busy night\" (waiters words himself), we didn't expect to wait maybe 10 minutes in the front to be seated or even acknowledged. This is nothing against the waiter, as he was awesome and consistently checked up on us."}
{"text":"So we came here for my friends daughters birthday... We originally tried to go to hooters, the servers were rude and gave a time limit on eating food so we said f that and came here. Jordan... best server EVER!!!! He checked in on our table consistently, he brought our food out in a timely manner and he even announced it was angel's birthday to the entire staff and brought her ice cream to go because we were running on a time crunch.. He also gave her a to-go cup for her Shirley temple. SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A RAISE!  Very approachable, was cracking jokes with us, and i really enjoyed our food!  Will be coming back and requesting to sit in his section."}
{"text":"Our favorite location in the valley for wings!   Yummy food and great service. We prefer to sit in the bar area, where we have now built a great rapport with Amber. Who by the way is a great server/bartender!!  She's prompt, friendly and makes a point to know her customers. Customer service is everything these days, and Amber delivers just that.   Thank you!  Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went to this location after a movie, around 9pm. Restaurant was almost empty, but we waited a good 10 minutes for a server to come take our order anyway. While we waited, we looked around and the place was absolutely filthy! There was dropped food under several tables around us, there was a broom and dustpan leaning against another table, several tables around us had yet to be cleared and wiped down. Maybe they had been really busy earlier, but there was certainly no reason someone shouldn't have been cleaning now. We went ahead and ordered food, burger and wings, which ended up being mediocre to say the least. Server never came back to ask if we needed anything, just dumped our food on the table and disappeared for the evening. We were there about 40 minutes from start to finish, and nobody ever came to pick up that broom and do some cleaning! The cleanliness standards here are obviously very low. We will NEVER return to this place."}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place. It's close to home and the restaurant is beautiful. It's clean and the staff is pretty friendly. So what's the problem? The food. It's expensive, small portions and not that tasty. To top it off you now have to order wings in packs or pay extra per wing and with an order of 12 wings you only get two sauce choices when you used to be able to get whatever you wanted. We might be back for a beer and maybe an appetizer but I don't think we will eat a meal here again."}
{"text":"Our visit was during happy hour on a Tuesday where we were surprised to find specials on both beer and and wings. I had the $4 Blue Moon and my husband the $3.75 Coors Light. We also shared some wings. The food was great, the beer was cold and the service was both friendly and attentive. We noticed that there are also $3 bud lights on Sunday! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has remodeled but don't let that fool you,  same bad food. My chicken strips were fried like catfish?!?! So weird? I couldn't taste any alcohol in my drink and the it took over 10 minutes to get me."}
{"text":"The wings were flavorful but on the small side and the wing sauce was not tossed on all the different flavors I ordered.  The strawberry spice was original.  The beer was cold.  Large Union Jack IPA's were 6.00.  Not bad for a 7.0% IPA.  Nothing to write home about.  Par for the course."}
{"text":"Food was meh at best. Wings tasted old with fresh sauce on them. Menu needed to be cleaned. Felt like I was holding something a 1000 other people had held? Seems like the remodeling was never completed? I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Seems to be going downhill. Orders get messed up regularly and food quality is decreasing. It almost feels like they're trying to cut corners.   My last visit included terrible service with half of our orders (party of 8) incorrect. Lunch service seems worse than dinner. I've been going here for years and it feels like owners have forgotten about this one."}
{"text":"They have lots and lots of TV if you want some wings and watch your football game this isn't a bad place not overly crowded. The wings are not the best I've had, I prefer Long Wong's on Dobson, but these aren't bad.  My server is the best part of it; she's really sweet and it was her birthday"}
{"text":"If I coukd give them less stars I would. Not only was the staff not not very friendly or Moving with urgency,  it took forever for them to greet us after being sat. 3 separate people came to us after we had to request service, one girl claimed to be our waitress then never came back. Another gentleman saved the day or else we would have just walked out. We wanted to have the tip given to the guy thst actually served us instead of our \"waitress\", who could have been a busser. Never again will step foot in this building and really makes me want to avoid native all together. Hopefully they get their act together or they won't be in business much longer since they don't want to earn our money."}
{"text":"Previous experience has not been the best in the past, but I must say food, service, and price was awesome tonight!  The 1/2 version of cookie is awesome  and is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the .49 cent wings with co-workers. Wings were good, but the service was bad. Very slow. Rarely got drink refills. Food took forever to come out (upwards of an hour for wings). Nice enough person, but we rarely saw her.   Most other Natives are great, but this one in particular has consistently slow service."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for nearly 6 yrs and we have seen tons of changes- some good and some horrible. Tonight we came in and experienced some of the worst host service from the moment we walked in. A new person was in the front- when we approached him he looked stunned that we were asking for a table for 2 on a Friday night and proceeded to recommend that we find seating in the bar area because it would be a 'long wait' for the dining area. We chose to put in our name and take our chances.  In the next 20 min we sat and watched him proceed to dissuade people from staying at the restaurant and had 17 people walk back out when he went from a 10 min wait to a 30 min wait and the last people he turned away he had told it would be an hour and 1/2 wait. Within minutes of that party walking out our table was ready and we walked into the dining area to see 9 booths open, 3 had couples in them, 1 table was dirty and there was a party of 10-12 people at the back. We proceeded to watch him continue to steer people away from the restaurant. Sad-  We ordered their new native buffalo fries and their new jalapeño puffs- the fries were great, the jalapeño puffs were absolutely disgusting- see picture below- um cheese whiz type cheese with sliced jalapeños that they put on the nachos wrapped in an overly fried but raw pastry wrap? WTH?  We ordered our wings as usual and still love them The new layout of the bar opening up into the restaurant is dysfunctional to say the least- hoping there is a clear direction they are taking to renovate this place. 2 stars for the wings of course !"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is really bad. It was almost like our server knew it, and felt bad for taking our order. Its really loud inside, which we thought was good because we have 3 kids.. But it seemed like the servers couldn't hear over the noise, and our order was screwy. Food was terrible."}
{"text":"Best karaoke ever !! Miriam is the bomb .. greets everyone and encourages them to sing .. she compliments everyone after they sing and she sings too!!! Can't wait to come back !!! Julian took great care of us!! Cheryl  #whodat?"}
{"text":"First time to try this place out. Friday evening, expected it to be far busier. Walked in and got dumb stares from the two kids at the front, neither seemed in any hurry to help us, despite being the only ones in front of them. Kid 1 finally asks us how many in our party and Kid 2 takes us back to a booth in back. Kid 2 drops off the menus, I thank her, and no response--just walks away. We were greeted shortly after by our server, who provided good service. We ordered boneless wings that were no bigger than McDonalds McNuggets. How they call these wings is a mystery to me. The plates came with two of the smallest celery sticks I've ever seen. We ordered a basket of fries to go with our 'wings' and those were quite tasty. The boneless wings themselves tasted not perfectly fresh to me and were warm, not hot, but at least had a good taste to them. We were a bit surprised to see another tables' dessert come out and it dwarfed our collective plates.   All in, it was mediocre. While it wasn't expensive, I'd rather find a better experience."}
{"text":"Looking at other reviews, I can't really stick up for the service.  I don't remember ever having absolutely horrible service, but I don't think I ever had exceptionally good service either.  You kind of have to wonder why they have these people working here with the econonmy the way it is.  You put up an ad for waiter or waitress and you could probably have your pick of hundreds of people- so take the best!  Oh well.  The food here is great, same as any other Native New Yorker. I reccomend the greasy pizza, wings, or a chicken philly.  Burgers are decent too.  And I love the fettucine alfredo, if they even still have that.  The TV set up they have on the outdoor patio is great for watching football.  I think part of the reason for the poor service is that it's the only place to go in Laveen so it gets really busy.  As soon as Laveen picks up and more places come in, I expect this place to settle down and find out it needs to have better service to compete."}
{"text":"What a great New Yorker. I think this is the best one I have been to. There are a number of very large TVs in the bar and dining room. All the tables and chairs are brand new, as are the TVs, bar, and I think the whole facility. Very nice. The walls are a bit empty but that's okay. Service was excellent.  Food was good too.  I shared a spinach artichoke dip and also had a California Cluck sandwich. It was a chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread with guac and bacon. Tasty. My only recommendation would be to turn down the lights in the bar area and have something going on late at nights for the weekends- like karaoke. Otherwise I think no one will come in late at night when there are no sports on."}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner the other night. When you first check in you get a free basket of their \"potato chips\". We got it flavored with the buffalo ranch dry rub. It's pretty good but the seasoning is definitely strong! I ordered their rain drop martini, which is not on their menu but it was quite tasty.   For wings, we ordered the honey bbq, medium and Asiago Parmesan. The honey bbq and medium wings were really over seasoned I think. Like they were drenched in sauce so it was a bit overwhelming for me. The Asiago Parmesan was really good.   The good thing is they have different specials every day of the week as well as happy hour and reverse happy hour which starts at 9:30. They have mediocre wings but I wouldn't say the best."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my family on a Thursday night & when the waitress seen us she was instantly rude rushing us to order only came to our table about two or three times, it was like if she was upset that they set us in her area, if my mother wasn't  with us she wouldn't have even gotten a tip VERY BAD SERVICE"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and after the first time, wasn't sure I would come back. It was the service the 1st time, not the food.  Today the service has been great and the wings are great.  Thanks Sidney."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Our take out order took over an hour and a half. When we finally received it, the toppings were wrong on our pizza and they messed up our salad order."}
{"text":"Was visiting this area and was referred to visit here. There were four of us that walked in this past Sunday to watch some football and grab wings and beer. Place was pretty empty and got a seat right away. Server came over and took our order of 3 beers and a gin and tonic, 15 min later we finally received our drinks. The Gin and tonic sat so long at the bar there was barely any ice. It took about another 20 min to even order our food and once we ordered it took 35 minutes for simple wings and fries. Once the wings came out they were cold but didnt want to send them back just to wait another 30 min. All around a pretty horrible experience. Wouldn't recommend visiting here unless you want terrible service and terrible food. Its funny because I had read the reviews before I went and it said the service was horrible, I couldnt believe it was that bad but I was terribly wrong. Big thumbs down to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible!  The food was horrible.  The boneless wings were so over cooked they looked black.  The burger tasted like it was fried with fish and the combo platter was so dried out you couldn't chew it.  The only redeeming part that gave them the 1 star was the waitress she was nice and friendly.  I remember the good ole days when Native was the best place in the state to get wings!  This new grill thing they have done is not an improvement but a down grade that will cause them to go out of business!"}
{"text":"First for the record, we called two hours before we went to this place to make sure a gift card we received a year ago would be okay.  We were told .. No problem at all. Sure. This place was a disaster.  You could sense it.  You could see the fear in the eyes of the waitstaff and the lack of urgency in the management team.  When we were seated we immediately saw that not one, not two but three tables around us were having issues with service.  No food, wrong orders ..  After a 7 minute wait for a server I went to the hostess station to see if they could fetch a server for us. Then we ordered .. Ordered an appetizer that never came.  Upon reminding server about it, it came with the meal.  Uhhh, that declassifies it as an appetizer. We order beers and meals and then we present our gift card.  Server returns and says (not a quote, but close) 'we don't have a machine to run this so we can't take it.'  Not an offer to ask, not an offer to try and make things right, just an unceremonious unwillingness to help.  We ask for a manager. After about 10 minutes they decide they will deduct the gift card, that they will not charge us for the misbegotten appetizer and we get this chestnut of an excuse from the boss .. (again close to a quote) 'We've only been open a week .. Blah blah blah.' Memo #1 to Native and the corporation opening these stores: This is NOT an acceptable reason for poor service.  If you're not ready to open, THEN DON'T OPEN! Memo #2 to Native:  There is a Buffalo Wild Wings about 10 minutes down McDowell Road from your place.  We're going there."}
{"text":"Coworkers during this past weekend drug me here for lunch as some were in the mood for wings. I mean let's face it, aren't we all in the mood for wings from time to time? Save those evil Vegans, of course. Nevertheless, beins' I'm from out of town and never heard of this joint I agreed, and I was pleased!   Mind you, I opted out of the wing mode and opted in to a sandwich. I know, sacrilegious right? I chose JD Salinger's sandwich, Turkey in the Rye - Grilled marble rye bread, stacked with chopped turkey, Swiss cheese, tangy coleslaw, and honey mustard dressing. It rocked! And I did not regret my choice one bit!   We sat in the bar with so many TV screens to look at I was confused as to where I should focus! It was nice, though, good service from Amber, and a good vibe all around.   \"I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, \"but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?\" I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, \"Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?\"  \"I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--\"  No, unlike Holden Caulfield's attempt at ordering alcohol, we were in uniform, so I settled for an Arnold Palmer. However, if it were evening hours I think this place would satiate anyone's thirst. And for full disclosure, I did try one of my friend's wings, and it was pretty good! So next time around, I think I might dive in and try a plate full of some honey hot wings, and so should you!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Not like the best wings I have ever had, but decent. With no customers, the service should have been better. When it came to the check, our waitress didn't charge us correctly, and we were forced to pay more or speak with management. We paid more and left. Try the strawberry hot wings, they are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came here to try some hot wings. When I was here years ago, it was called the Native New Yorker. The place hasn't changed much. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter Connor. He was polite and informative about the menu. I ordered the 12 pack with 2 different sauces. I had the honey chipotle which was 3 away from being the hottest, and the ghost pepper wings which were toe top of the scale. The wings were delivered shortly after being ordered. They didn't appear to have much sauce on them. I tried the chipotle honey first. The wing was kind of dry and not spicy at all. My wife who does NOT do spicy could handle it. The ghost pepper wing was also kind of dry. It had a little kick, but so does a dying corpse. Connor asked how the wings were. When I told him they were a little dry and not very spicy, He said that they lightly sauce the extreme flavors. He brought out some additional sauce. This made my wings come alive and not seem so dry. If I had known to order extra sauce this may have made my favorite hot wing list. I will be back. I want to try their burgers, fish and pizza."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's awful. There is no consistency. Bill the general manager is really nice and really cares about his customers and is on the ball. Windy, Zac and Spencer are GREAT servers.  For a place that says wings are their thing, well, again , sometimes they are good and sometimes they are awful as in overcooked and like shoe leather and served cold. Today was such a day. I told the shift manager and she gave me lip service. I left the leftovers there, since they would only go to the dog. I don't know if I want to go back. $15 for some wings that most were cold and tough and one was inedible. I would miss the good servers and Bill, but, jeez.......... how hard is it to get wings to a table cooked properly and not cold????? I was there early at 11:00 when the place was empty and not busy,so what's the excuse?"}
{"text":"Real hit and miss here I've had good meals and I've also gotten sick off their food. Twice! The bar is usually crowded with riff raff and the staff has been not helpful on many occasions. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my fiancé and MIL. Ordered the buffalo chicken nachos which were great, I really liked whatever cheese sauce was on the nachos. We then ordered 12 wings, half Asian garlic and half hot. The hot was pretty hot, I'm super surprised my fiancé got through them. I really liked the Asian garlic, I wanted to try more \"Asian\" inspired wing flavors since I had really liked a similar sauce from BWW and this sauce did not disappoint. We also ordered the special pizza of the day which was a 14\" cheese pizza for $6.99. It was really soft and I'm used to a crispier pizza (especially underneath) but I heated it two days later and it tasted way better. Also, it was a huge pizza for the price. My MIL ordered 6 wings that I can't remember the flavor and a pound of chicken strips to-go. All together our order came to $54 which I thought was super reasonable. The food was pretty standard but it was enjoyable. Service was great, our waitress was attentive and polite. I'd probably go back during happy hour."}
{"text":"Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in after golf for some lunch and a little football. It was a bad decision. Service is terrible. It looks like they're short handed. We won't do this again."}
{"text":"The wings and the service was average. But a great place to meet up with friends for a drink"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bar with my wife for a appetizer and drink. The happy hour price is nice and happy it doesn't jump to high after 5. Staff was friendly and fast service. Small place but not a bad stop. Maybe the lights at the bar could be dimmed a bit to help with how bright it is."}
{"text":"My favorite wing place in AZ. Need to expand in to California. Honey Hot if the favorite. Only issue took a little long to get a beer as I rubbed my empty glass hoping it would magically fill full of crisp suds."}
{"text":"Lindsey is a awesome Bartender!! Friendly and always making sure you have a cold refill. See you soon Lindsey!"}
{"text":"These guys need to get there pick up act together !! EVERYTIME we try to get an order to go they act like they have never done a to go order!!!!     Good food if your eating in ... NOT WORTH IT IF YOUR GETTING IT TO GO!!!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice but not very efficient.  Had the buffalo chips, which i really love. They make their own \"chip\" and some were really, really burned.  I ordered the chicken wings and they were absolutley dry.  I had to ask for more sauce to put on them.  Makes eating them not as much fun, when you have to correct them. My husband ordered the calzone and he was not impressed."}
{"text":"Moved down the street from here about 2 yrs ago. We finally made it in and it wasn't what we had expected from what we heard from some friends. Service wasn't thee best but it doesn't stop there. Upon receiving our check I was like, what!!! For this, WoW! Glad I had a $25 Gift card and free strippers, our bill came out to 62.67. I put in a $25 GC and a hundred dollar bill and I received $45 cash back. You do the math I was short $25 which got fixed and I still left a small tip just because. Then I looked at our receipt and noticed we didn't pay $0.69 for our wings we ended up paying $1.20 and on a Tuesday when they should be .69 any how I went back in to ask for a refund but then thought to myself for what, is it worth it ? and just walked out. It was our first time here and our last. I wouldn't recommend it but hey you might like it. As far as the bar side I really don't know. We don't drink so can't comment on that. Loaded potatoes were good and so was the wedge salad. Food wasn't hot, I'll just stop there you guys have a good and hope it goes good for you."}
{"text":"Been here a few times but i still ask why service is horrible. A ton of employees running around but no one knows what they are doing I guess. Has to be poor management as they are not trained. The bartenders don't greet their customers and when you order drinks it takes forever. Probably because they are talking to customers that already have drinks. Their food is pretty good but not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Native for years Cruz was my server He was awesome Excellent service and a great personality!! Ask for Cruz!"}
{"text":"We came here twice on this trip down to Phoenix and it was good and the wait staff was great ! Salt and pepper dry rub was a great taste on the wings for some of the youngs that did not want blistering heat !"}
{"text":"In 2009 I moved cross country looking forward to enjoying family time and grilled wings like the times I ate here on my many vacations.  The \"other\" wing place stopped grilling their wings, but Native is happy to accommodate that request!  Grilling makes a crispier, less-greasy wing.  The service is always attentive and this place is a local fave. I know I know it's just elevated fast food but I like it.   Wish they had free wifi.  P.S. The fried zucchini is really good."}
{"text":"I usually hit this place with a friend of mine who is a wing fanatic.  I hear good things about the wings, but I usually order something else.    The dining room can get pretty packed and loud, but I've never had to wait more than five minutes.    Some of the bench seats in the dining room area are a bit broken down and or/crooked, which can make yer back or buttocks hurt after sitting for a while.    No drink deals worthy of mention that I am aware of, but I usually stick to draft beer.  All in all a pretty decent joint."}
{"text":"I wish i can do 0 but i went in for dinner tonight the front girls didnt explain that one side was dine in and the other was apparently a lounge setting so i went and sat down at the first booth in the \"lounge\" area and waiting 7 mins for a menu after having to ask the front girls my waitress finally camr over with no hi how are you went directly into \"what can i get for you\" allowed me to get 2 dressings with me salad but when i needed a ranch and a bbq that again i had to ask the front girls for because our waitress was no where to be found, waitress comes to table to say that its .50 for more sauce!!! Which is ridiculous i asked for manager who by the way is the worst i have ever experienced he had the audacity to say that it was my fault i sat on this side and it was standard policy to charge for extra things which is something i have never experienced before as i am a server as well and have been for years in corporate and family owned restaurants and never have i been charged for extra sauce so i say to him how unprofessional he is with dealing with this and how terrible their customer service is and he wants to stand there and argue with me i had to repeat 2 times that i do not want to speak anymore and i just want my check which he hands me only for me to turn around and have both managers standing on either side of the door like fucking security i will never be going back to this or any native again!!!"}
{"text":"I've grown up in AZ and remember coming to Native New Yorker for a long time. There wings were always top notch and the tastiest around. Recently, it seems like they changed the recipe for the wings and they are no longer as good. It's almost like there is too much breading on them. The place is still a decent neighborhood joint but I think the quality of the food has dropped over the years."}
{"text":"We have now ordered from Native at least 3 times in the last month from DoorDash and they have did a great job every time.   We've tried the pizza, wings (chicken & waffles, salt & pepper, habanero mango sauce) and even tried the loaded tots on one occasion.   Something about the pizza and the crust that got me hooked. My daughter loves it and it seems to work for date night for them and the babysitter.   We'll keep ordering since it's quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere but best of all was the service! Amber was my delightful young lady of the hour. Amber was very sweet. I just wanted to dip her in my ranch sauce and eat her up. My wife wants to bring her home with us. Could you please relay this information to the manager. Thx again. This place is on point. Amber come to the dark side"}
{"text":"Wings were big, but just decent.  Ice cold beer thought!!  Stopped by after a late afternoon job in the area."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME that I have been there has been very good.  TERRIFIC staff and management along with GREAT food.   $.59 wings on Tuesdays (we order 30. 15 Asian Garlic and 15 Honey Hot)... How do you beat that?   For a hamburger, my wife likes the AZ Burger and I like the Skyscraper.  CHECK OUT THIS LOCATION.   Say HEY to Tyler."}
{"text":"In looking for a place serving food after midnight we found that Native's (BTW, when did they shorten their name?) Full kitchen is open till 1am.  We got boneless wings, I actually try this at almost every bar!  Just love little pieces of chicken breast that's deep fried and covered is some kind of sweetish sauce.  Tried their sweet bbq and it was decent.  The breading quickly got soggy and the sauce was kind of sparse.  Ended up just asking for extra BBQ, which they were happy to help with.  There are just better wings and sauces at other places around here.  We also got a burger and fries but the fries were kinda limp and the burger just wasn't anything to write home about.  Overall, its just a very average place.  I think maybe in n out with a burger and chocolate milkshake would better hit that 1am craving if you're not looking for a beer too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cold beer and good TVs, this is your place.  If you want to eat, forget about it.  Andy, our bartender, worked his butt off and did a very good job.  The beer was good and cold and service was excellent.  Even our meals were timely, but that's where it stops.  The wings were tiny and dry, the zuchini mushy.  If they had a James Beard chef in the kitchen, the meal would not be any better.  This is NOT the problem of the kitchen staff, it's the problem of whomever is ordering the food. Someone needs to CARE what's coming out of the kitchen. A cook can only do so much with a terrible frozen product.   The Native New Yorker gives off the impression that they offer food only because it's got room for a dining room.  People want to eat while they drink and watch sports.  So, come on, put some effort and money into it! Your cooks must be embarrased."}
{"text":"Food was okay. My husband really enjoyed his wings and my girls liked the Mac n cheese. The fries were really good. The Burger I got was okay. I ordered the Hangover burger without lettuce and subbed cheddar for the pepper jack. It came with lettuce and American cheese not cheddar. I removed the lettuce and started eating only to realized the fried egg was burnt as was over half of the burger. (Charred black) I had planned to give 3 stars, but when we got the bill and saw the server added on 2 kid ice teas when both my girls had water, that lost a star. Especially since the server said oh I couldn't remember so I added in ice tea. Really?? Not sure if we will be back or not."}
{"text":"Good service and food was good, but we witnessed a server go to the bathroom and not wash her hands! Eeeew!"}
{"text":"We had a great time, excellent service and enjoyed good food. My husband and daughter had the atichoke spinach dip appetizer and a batch of medium and hot wings, I had the apple walnut salad. Lots of big screen tv's all around the dining and bar area, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wings are always good that's about all I eat at this place. Other than that I can't comment on the rest but the drinks are always cold and a good variety."}
{"text":"Chris, one of the managers showed us real quality service during our visit on 3/25. He is very friendly and attentive stopping by our table to ensure our satisfaction. Our waiter took good care of us as well. We also really enjoyed the wings! Native will continue to be our go to for a wide variety of what we know to be very tasty wings!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Native Grill back when their name was Native New Yorker and wings were $ .10 a wing ( dine in only, $ .25 for take out ) Oh the \" Good Ole' Days \" They have the best wings in town. I love their happy hour food and drink specials. They have a friendly staff and service was very good.  Amber the bartender was exceptionally friendly and offered a few good meal choices. She made sure that I had all my needs met. I highly recommend this Native for a pleasurable lunch/dinner/happy hour experience."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a native since it's been called \"Native New York\" but I wasn't disappointed. I went on a Wednesday and the bar was the only place \"crowded\" which I didn't mind because I can appreciate an empty place. The service was great, which might have had to do with the place being a wee bit empty but overall I enjoyed myself and the food. I think the wings were a lot better back in the day before they renamed everything but I would still go back for the wings. Overall, it satisfied my wing craving."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar. Nothing to really say here, wings were good...just like all the wings ive ever had...ever."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place for beers and food!  The main reason: the Staff---Specifically, their awesome bartender, Amber!!!  I, along with my son, my gf, and my friends have been coming here for years (literally!!)....and it is always for the one reason....they treat us all as family!! For example, when my son and I come in to have some food and to relax, Amber doesn't even ask what we want to drink....she remembers what we like and serves us within 2 minutes...tops!! That, my friends, is exceptional customer service!!! I would give the staff here 10 stars...! Come and eat, drink, and meet the 'family'!"}
{"text":"Thursday afternoon, about 4:30, getting tires at Discount. Place was empty so we were seated right away. Twenty minutes later we got our drinks, chicken will be ready shortly! I must have ordered the  \"rare\" as in hard to find chicken, still waiting. I think they have more wait staff than customers? Maybe they went to the Goodyear Ballpark for the sliders? IDK....35 minutes later I get my sliders, two minutes for the gravy on the chicken fried chicken. Papa says the chicken was good. Especially the gravy! Sliders were average at best. Mgr compd the chicken. YMMV"}
{"text":"I love this place I go here often to have a few drinks with friends. Everyone is so polite and I especially silly love one of the bartenders they have! Her name is Veronica and she's super awesome, makes perfect drinks and has great vibes! I defiantly  recommend you go visit!"}
{"text":"Native is your typical wing and bar restaurant. The food is average but the atmosphere is fun. TV's are plentiful and there is a different game on each one. Service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly. The menu is diverse and will have something to please everyone."}
{"text":"It took 50 minutes did nachos. Which were not up to par. Very disappointing! No one was able to give us update. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"We ordered a Buffalo Chicken Pizza and asked them to leave the onions and green peppers off of one half. When it came to the table they forgot to leave them off, so they comped us a personal pan pizza. The boneless wings were cold and had no taste. The waitress forgot to bring us Parmesan cheese, not once but twice. The pizza sucks I'll stick to Rosatis!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good place to watch the Sunday game. My choice to meet with friends. I am a big fan of the Buffalo Chips and Hot Wings dusted"}
{"text":"What happened to the NYer authentic quality  ingredients? Had fun at Karaoke night last evening, however, missing the 'good food', not heated frozen offerings. I guess if you drink enough, you don't care what the food is like."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here. After waiting upwards of 35-45 minutes for our food, most of it arrived at room temperature, as if it had been sitting unheated/unattended for 20 minutes. The \"medium\" hamburger we ordered was \"well done\". I asked for 75% honey barbecue wings, the rest another flavor I had never tried, and I got more of the new flavor than honey barbecue.  We then made the mistake of ordering dessert and then waited another 30 minutes for that to arrive.  Two stars only because the manager came by and had two of our meals remade so they could come out warm."}
{"text":"Me and my parents came after a ball game for a quick bite. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and sports which was a pleasant surprise! She kept us laughing and the food was great! The only drawback was how long it took to be seated but they were short staffed that day so it's understandable."}
{"text":"Eesh. I'm going to try to avoid this place. I'll admit it's not my style at all though it suits others just fine: not veg friendly, not energetic, not worth the money. I don't have to eat like a health nut to enjoy my food, but even their french fries suck. And that's my main criteria for judging mediocre venues with limited meatless fare. You could earn an entire star with good french fries despite a crappy atmostphere. Native New Yorker? Fail.  The other food I saw wandering around looked pretty, um, bad...from what I hear the pizza is especially unappetizing. The waitstaff was average and on the slow side. The beer selection is ok and I sat contently with my Stella. But overall this is not my scene."}
{"text":"Awful service, our server Kevin wouldn't help us when we had an issue, another server helped us Riley was rude, we asked to see a manager and we weren't able to talk to them. Wouldn't go back to that location."}
{"text":"If chicken don't have arms, where do chicken fingers come from?  Revamped and refreshed.  It's like when Puff Daddy started calling himself P.Diddy --- this place went from Native New Yorker to Native Grill & Wings.  Gone is the dark and dingy Native New Yorker with its unnecessary half-walls.  Now we have a nicely lit, laminate flooring, dining space with the same food at the same price.  Tons of TVs are hung on the walls still so this place gets packed when there's a sporting event or a fight going on.  I usually just pop in for some wings to-go.  Wings are pretty standard.  They're meaty and they have a huge list of flavors you can slap onto your bird.  From super saucy to dry-rub, sweet to spicy, you can get whatever tickles your fancy.  I personally stick with two flavors:  Strawberry Hot and Asiago Parmesan.  Averaging at $1 a wing, unless you go on their special wing night, there's plenty of other places you can go to but this place is close to home.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food was good but the servers have gone back to their old ways.  They all keep running over to the bar and staying.  Had to complain to the cashier to get someone to take order. Servers don't know what beer is on tap. Don't tell you drink specials. Got seated by the bus boy. Then he just left without going to the bar and telling our server. Awful."}
{"text":"Service sucks, the food is very plain. I only get boneless wings after trying several other entrees, good place to watch a game"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The only problem is that a lot of people know about this place. It's usually packed and for good reason."}
{"text":"Ehh wings and beer. Comfort food but its a chain now and it's starting to look like it."}
{"text":"I went back to Native and the wings were just as delicious as the first time. That's the bone in Honey Barbecue.    After the first review, the Manager Robert sent me a message. I had mentioned the fries were forgotten so came out late. It wasn't a bad thing but he wanted to make it right. Being the detailed person I am, when we decided to go back and was on our way, I called to see if he was there. Lindsey answered the phone and was very polite.  Upon arrival, Emily greeted us and was also our server. She provided excellent service throughout our meal. Hubby and I enjoyed the combo platter for our appetizer. Everything was tasty. I prefer bones in my chicken so after the first piece I was done with the chicken, the loaded potato skins were so good as well as the other items. You won't be disappointed with that appetizer. See pic.  I ordered only the 5-pack and thoroughly enjoyed them. I am not a fries person but theirs are so good I'll get them the next time with my chicken if I don't have an appetizer. Hubby enjoyed his fish & chips. I did have a few of his fries. We will be back. It's close to home, the staff is polite and the food we've hade is great!  I'd like to add on both visits the restroom was clean. That's important to me.   ******************* First visit  This week Hubby came to this restaurant we had never been to since moving to AZ. Since they're a \"wing place\" per our server, I was not trying to be disappointed by getting a salad so I went off my no fried challenge.  I was not disappointed. The honey barbecue bone-iwings are delicious. I will be getting them whenever I return. I would have given 4 stars but the cook forgot the fries so they did not come out with the rest of the food. They were also delicious."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed waited to go after the rush of the new place. This place had really bad service our own waitress walked around with our food looking for what table ordered it. Over priced for lackluster food to have wings in name I personally would never eat them again here. To many other places to go avoid this place save your money."}
{"text":"Look, I don't frequent sports bars often. This is a basic sports bar with lots of TVs, Inside and outside seating with half the bar open to outside.  I had some of the food, it's your basic sports bar food, the people were very nice. All around you won't be disappointed. Remember, it's a sports bar!"}
{"text":"The food here was great.  The waitress was fantastic.  We did have a hiccup though.  One of the hostess people, set us on the patio.  No one knew we were out there.  Once they figured it out, they were 5 stars but not for the first 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to start.  When we came in we were greeted and sat right away.  They were moderately busy but not overcrowded.  We waited what felt like a long time for our waitress to acknowledge us.  After that I started paying attention.  16 minutes after we ordered we got our drinks and immediately asked for straws.  We ordered a new appetizer on their menu, Buffalo fries, they were amazing.  Don't miss out on these.  We ordered it as an appetizer and told the waitress this.  We got the appetizer about 45 seconds to a minute before we got our lunch.  I ordered the Arizona Burger, it was amazing.  My wife ordered a $5 slice of Pizza and Soda offer.  She had me try their pizza and it was quite good.  Their sauce on the pizza was amazing.  Later after we finished our meals, she brought us a refill for our sodas, in which I asked her for some straws again.  Now we were there for a long time, still no straws.  She apologized and said she would bring to go cups, nice touch. She brought our to go cups and ....... you guessed it no straws.  We paid for our meal and as we were leaving we finally got straws.  I looked at the bill, they over charged us for our $5 Pizza drink special.  I already paid, that is my fault, I should have looked better but know that I wouldn't have waited to get it corrected because I wouldn't have felt confident on the timeline of the bill.  Would you?"}
{"text":"Horrible service, generic food and lackluster atmosphere... I have tried to find something nice to say, but I cant... I wish I had the server some people on here have had, I can not imagine ever having a reason to come back here."}
{"text":"I will give two stars because server was cool.  Food, not great.  Sliders I had were so hard that I couldnt even chew on them.  Meat inside was dry, and texture was bad.  Also the wings were not even close to be what they should be.  Few of them were cold and mushy.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Wings were ok, nothing to brag about unfortunately.  Flavors were ok, and some were so similar it was hard to tell which were which?  Buddies both had burgers and said they were decent.   Service was friendly and place was clean!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food and drinks are what you expect from Native New Yorker. The biggest and best difference: THE STAFF!   Everyone there is friendly, thoughtful, and efficient. Special shout-out to Hillary, the server, who does an excellent job, and Chris the bartender. He makes the world's best key lime pie martini.  Someone at another table order some apple crisp/ice cream dessert. Looked very delicious. Since I was already enjoying my fifth chocolate martini, I passed on the dessert...this time.  Lots of big screen TVs for the sports fans and Buzztime Trivia, which is very important to me.   ...maybe it was six martinis...hmmmm"}
{"text":"Despite the number of Yelpers stating this place has slow/bad service, I decided to try it for myself. Silly me!  The bartender spent more time looking at liquor bottles and restocking than the seven people sitting at the bar. She did spend time talking to wait staff and some of her friends over at the service area. Couldn't even get her attention to place a food order.   On the bright side, there was plenty of open parking space and the Coca-Cola was cold."}
{"text":"Went there this evening for dinner. Discovered it was closed.  Signage had been removed from the building and all the lights out. Wish everyone who worked there the best of luck."}
{"text":"The main reason I give 5 stars is for the wings. They have so many flavors and I have tried them all because they don't mind bringing you a single wing all by itself! It's awesome. I love the strawberry hot, and the honey mustard is nice too. Not to keen on the Asian flavors though, they basically taste like soy sauce. I like to get the medium with side of hot sauce. The wings are always so nice as crisp. The warm bacon salad is good too, and you can't go wrong with cheese fries (if they are not on the menu just ask for it). I go here to see the game when it is not on regular cable (Go Bears!) and they will try their best to put you where you can see the game you want. I like the atmosphere here because I can take my wife without her feeling like it is some sporty pick-up joint. Nice place to bring the family."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker has never disappointed however the only thing I've ever eaten there are the wings, oh and the fries. I proceed to slather everything in ranch and enjoy the mess I've created. I think the hot wings are great, although the mild is pretty unappetizing and flavorless but who goes for hot wings and gets mild...well besides kids? :)  The mild wings are made with wheat flour, so anyone with gluten allergies beware. However, all the other wings- medium through death (or whatever fun name they give it) aren't. I like it, it's cheap, fast and yummy."}
{"text":"I came into the store with a larger party, we all ordered basic dishes and yet it took an hour for hour food. We took up our entire lunch break just sitting there, they actually brought the bill before the food what a joke!"}
{"text":"Been a long time customer of this specific location and have seen it go down hill. Traditional wings used to come in 6 and 12 packs and were quite large, menu changed to 5 and 10 packs. Then sometime in January the wings got smaller but the price still stayed the same as the larger 12 pack wings.  CAUTION TO MILITARY: Military discount used to be 10% off of the total bill, tonight I only received $1.00 of of a $45.50 bill. After talking to a manager I was informed that the policy is to only discount the Military members entree not the whole bill. Not sure what since that makes since I was at dinner with my family to include 2 dependents and another military member. Additionally, other military member was not asked for I.D. as well in order receive discount under this policy. Manager explained this isn't a new policy it was Native's policy that just was not being enforced at this location."}
{"text":"AVONDALE LOCATION- 5/25/15  Not first time poor service but we came back to try  again.  Appetizers served with dinner while main dish got soggy. Manager stated \"most people want wings with dinner\",  instead of being understanding. THEN WHY IS IT LABELED APPETIZERS? ??? He offered wet naps and never brought them, never offered a discount or came back to see if everything was ok.  Poor customer service.  We paid for a full meal and didn't eat 80% ugh left very unsatisfied, hungry and an irritated stomach."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in 2009 for me.  Where do I start?  1.  Sat at a table that had menus and silverware, but was obviously not wiped down. 2.  They can't decide who our server is, 5 mins, 6 mins, 7 mins go by... and right at about 10 mins. someone is our server. 3.  Menu says Sam Adams on draft.  Turns out, after a long wait, there is no Sam Adams on tap and we order again. 4.  Potato chips were delayed because they did not have any pre-made chips.  They arrived with the main meal. 5.  Kitchen staff was joking around, girls screaming, almost as if it was a little Spring Break party inside and everyone could hear them. 6.  Calzone was ice cold in the middle.  Frozen ricotta cheese? 7.  Pizza was burnt on the top.  No, you're not supposed to have those black circular splotches on the cheese. 8.  Just a few casual apologies from the teenage waiter for the above.  No manager apology, no \"comped\" items, nothing.  This place seems like it was transplanted from some dopey college campus where every customer is 21 or under and just comes here to get drunk, regardless of food quality, service, and the time it takes to get food.  Native New Yorker is a failure.  I regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously, since NNY has a clear trend towards the low end of things, at this location and on Bell."}
{"text":"DONT CALL PHONE ORDERS IN, I asked for simple pound of wings and loaded Fries they said 15 mins I came in 35 mins later( cuz the same thing happened 3 months before) and I was stuck waiting almost another 15 mins total of 50 mins! And as I was walking out a guy was waking back in with the order they messed up and took for ever on. I've been going to native for 15 years and they've completely fallen off especially this one! Which is a bummer cuz I'm so close"}
{"text":"Allen is by far the best waiter I have had! He's on top of my waters and very friendly! Great place"}
{"text":"As far as Natives go, I really liked this one. Great patio space with corn hole to mix up a fun afternoon with friends. The bartenders can make just about anything your little heart desires. Tiffany killed the red beer game. Oh, and it's relatively new so things are still so fresh and so clean clean :-)  If you plan on stopping in for some drinks and wings, you'll be happy"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Ordered potato skins and they were tiny and cold! Asked for ranch from the bar tender and she completely ignored us. She's now on her cell phone. WOW! There's also a backpack open sitting next to the register...who knows if she's dropping money in it. Just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Went back to Native today and once again I had great service.  My server, Alex, she was very attentive and very nice.  We sat in the bar and didn't have to wait to order drinks and food which I was very happy about.  Everything came quickly and was cold for the Side Salad and hot for the House Special Pizza.  Alex didn't even have me waiting to refill my drink.  Great job today.  :)"}
{"text":"They were very busy. Disappointed that we didn't get a seat in the big room. The good was delicious.  Disappointed thst they charge extra for almost everything like ranch or a substitution for a side salad instead of fries. Sevice was a bit slow."}
{"text":"The boys always want to go to Native, but this is the last time. I've always waited forever for my food, but this time it was a nightmare. 20 mins to get a drink, 40 minutes to get the appetizer! My 3 year old waited 20mins for his milk and 60 mins for his chicken strips! If it wasn't my step-sons bday I would have been out. Great place if you are going to hang out for hours and watch sports BUT horrible place to go with kids. U almost need to eat before you go."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers my husband and I have had nothing but trouble with the staff at this location. They disappear for 10-15 minute periods and rarely refill your drinks unless you flag them down and ask. Some of them also have a knack for ignoring you once they've given you the check...  The food here is usually good. We get their Native Style Strippers with BBQ sauce and the cheesy garlic bread, both are yummy.   Beware if you get take-out from here, they have a tendency to screw up your order. One time we got honey BBQ instead of normal. Oftentimes they forget to give you things like ranch/sour cream or give you prepackaged when you asked for house dressing. You really have to check your order before you leave.   Even though the food is good, if there were more in the way of restaurants out here (hopefully there will be soon) we would probably go here maybe a once a month instead of once a week."}
{"text":"Service was just fine! But the problem was the my girlfriend left her phone on the table when we left. We went back to get it and not one employee would help us find it. Everyone we talked to said they didn't see it. We were gone at the most 15 min."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the build-your-own flatbread. What can I say... delicious. The great variety of options allows you to customize this great dish to your own specific flavor profile. I personally had pepperoni that was savory and salty with juicy pineapple. If pineapple doesn't belong in pizza, it sure does belong on flatbreads!   I always bring my friends to this place when they are coming in from out of town because the happy hours are GREAT! Only $5 for craft-sequel cocktails. Talking about cheap cocktails... these are actually made with decent liquor like Patron.  Service: it's great. Tyler makes it even better. He's been here for a bit and really knows how to make sure that you'll have a good time. He's courteous, knowledgeable about the menu, and creative. He'll make sure to recommend a dinner/drink combination to ensure a unique experience you won't forget. Seriously, he's the man. Good service is hard to sometimes, but not here."}
{"text":"Native New Yorker seemed like a place that would have awesome pizza.  We had pizza, wings, salad, and some beer.  The best part of the meal was actually the salad.  The pizza tasted fairly plan and very greasy."}
{"text":"The food was awful. I don't even think the kids Mac and cheese was cooked on the same day. Very disappointed:("}
{"text":"Wings are good and Tanner was super awesome! However, Nick lacks any emotional intelligence, has no customer service, and is quite confrontational. Additionally, John, who we learned is a manager trainee, but imposed himself as THE manager of the restaurant, provided some lame excuses for non issue items, which then makes them an issue (e.g. No carrots... told it was due to no carrots being farmed from current California drought, which has been declared over for months, then due to wage increase they could not offer carrots; both ridiculous.  Advice, get rid of both John and Nick, and promote Tanner to manager. We will be following this up with a letter to corporate as well to be sure it has an impact."}
{"text":"Tried a Native New Yorker in Mesa when I first moved to the valley in 2010. Wasn't too impressed so never returned until recently, where we tried this location. This site was nice and new, I liked that. Bacon ranch chicken flatbread was very good, but that's where the fun ended. Service was a tad slow, and food came out ...just warm. By the time I was halfway through the dish it was cold. Looking at other reviews this seems to be a trend. On the plus side the wing sauces were good. Also, don't be fooled...their \"BUFFALO\" style fish sliders are nothing more than a fried fish sandwich with cayenne pepper sprinkled on top. Based on our experience it may be another four years until we try nny again."}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time. We have been going to native wings since 1984. Stephanie took care of us. She was amazing."}
{"text":"Place looks pretty cool, just walked over from hotel to grab a bite to eat. Beer was cold and the bartender was cool, she was helpful and attentive. Had the AZ burger, it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"It seems when your an \"out of towner\", the food is better! lol   We don't have Native New Yorker in Northern California so I thought it was a \"treat\". But yesterdays visit was okay. Food was good. Atmosphere is the same old. And service was questionable. We intentionally came in a few hours before the typical Saturday night dinner starts, but the service was still slow (slow for a group of 7). Another thing that bugged me was the room that we were in played 1 football game on 3 tv's. Umm, verity please.   Overall, I enjoyed my shrimp, fries and hot wings."}
{"text":"Well, my husband loves wings so we have been here a handful of times. Unfortunately the rest of their food is just meh. Only options that are remotely fresh and not a big bucket of grease are the salads and you can also get the make-to-order flatbread with veggies on it and parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella. I guess the food and atmosphere are a typical sportsbar so I can't really penalize them too much just because that is not my cup of tea. It works pretty well for a group since they have a bunch of large tables and a ton of TVs with every game on all at once. I will give them props for having Magic Hat #9 on tap at our last visit. The service is usually pretty good as well. I am always amazed at how many kids are there on our visits so I guess you could say that this is a very family-friendly bar (a concept I will never understand)."}
{"text":"San Francisco 49ers Bar - need I say more. Go Niners!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and was given excellently fast service by Melissa. Wings were perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"Makes third time we've been here in the last six months blender broken still not fixed. May not be back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Drinks come in big glasses and all the food was excellent with lots of TVs to watch every game. A big step up from BWWs. Erin was our server on football Sunday and was very attentive and pleasant. We definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"To start:  To CCW/RKBA:  NO FIREARMS ALLOWED.  I got an order to go.  Asian Garlic & Hot Chili (formerly Suicide)  The wings are not very crispy, but the sauce is good.  The Hot Chili Wings were not very hot, but still tasty.  But overall, I have had better, and I would not give my money to an anti-gun restaurant again.  It is weird that that they would pick a location next to the largest retailer of firearms (Cabela's)."}
{"text":"Hostess is not 'on' it. Waited 5 min before she even acknowledged me. Other than that, seems like a good place to hang.  The food was a bit mediocre.  Nellos is better."}
{"text":"Came to natives after an A's game and dealt with very slow service. We were passed from one waitress to another and the waitress we were passed to continued to help everyone else. She didn't even bother to come and ask us if we were going to place an order. We were planning on placing a fairly big order for two people but decided to just go to Taco Bell since we figured service would be better. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on 3 different occasions now and have yet to receive good service. I go back because I like the food and near my house but I'm losing patience. Each time I've gone our waiter disappears for a long period of time and we've had to sit without drink refills so I've had to find someone and ask them for help. All while this is happening you have 2 or 3 employees behind the bar visiting with each other. I'm really hoping management gets the poor service figured out soon!!"}
{"text":"I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient!  But I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible. On more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience.  Now when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, cold beer and attentive service, yeah the price of wings are pretty outrageous and the quality seems to be hit and miss."}
{"text":"Consistently inconsistent service. Food isn't bad. Food isn't great.  Consistently inconsistent service. Food isn't bad. Food isn't great."}
{"text":"I have used this store for over 15 years, but tonight was the final last straw.  Previous 3 orders were wrong, only solution the \"new\" management was \"drive on back to the store and we will fix the problem\" really? After driving to pick up my order, asking if they were SURE it was correct, get home and nope its not.  Tonight we had our order delivered and yep, no salad. Store said \"well just drive on over and we will get you your salad\"  Thats it, this store SUCKS."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular at this place.  I never had a problem with service and the manager there is very good and attentive.  Over the past 6 months I began to notice a huge change.  First the food portions are way smaller.  The wings, which they are supposed to be known for look like they came of chickens that had anorexia, there was almost no meat on the bone.  The last time we went my wife ordered them grilled.  They came out charred and not one person, chef, expediter or server noticed this?  Pathetic.  She was so done with this place she didn't even bother to send them back.  We also noticed the side salads were noticeably smaller.  I mean cutting costs on the amount of lettuce you use?    I am not a big fan nor was when we used to go there often of their pizza, I think the crust is to soggy for my liking.  Sandwiches are decent, but the amount of fries you now get is far less, more cost cutting measures it seems.  The final straw was a month or so ago I was informed that to sit in the bar area you now must put your name on a list.  Who has a seating list for the bar area?  I never heard of such a thing.    In the hyper competitive world of sports bars, in the SE Valley area I can find a few more that have better quality food, with larger portions for about the same price.  They now get my hard earned dollars.  The only reason its not a 1 is that I do like many of the servers there and unlike many reviews have never had an issue with this part of the place."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of native since high school when wings were $.10 ea.  Today I am discussed with Native and will never eat here again. Wings are now over $1 each. Highway Robbery. 12 wings almost $14. WTF!?  And they were over cooked, and only warm so by the time you take a bite into your third wing, they are cold."}
{"text":"The wings are great! The service is friendly, it took 45 minutes for us to get 2 dozen wings ath STV location."}
{"text":"Horrible just horrible. The worst service ever and the burgers taste like saw dust. Would give zero stars if I could.."}
{"text":"yuck is all I can say... not like the old Native New Yorker... new sauces are not good.. wings are small..service was so slow on the several time I went there.. wont go again overpriced poor food."}
{"text":"On our second visit we waited about 10 minuets to be seated. Not because the restaurant was busy but because there was no on at the dest to seat us. I had find someone. The bar seemed to be full but very few in the restaurant side. It seems like the focus on the bar side. The food was good and if it was not for the poor service I would probably eat there occasionally. But there are many restaurants in this area that the service is much better."}
{"text":"If I could rate no stars I would. Tonight we got the worst service of Our Lives. Extremely rude waitress, Amy. Food came out wrong. Drinks were empty and sides didn't come out. We had to ask for silverware and straws and the waitress gave us so much attitude about everything.  Our server was just standing around or talking so it's not like she was even busy so we had to have a manager take over. We had ten people at our table and we were prepared to leave up to a $100 tip because most of us have served before and understand how did industry is. She was lucky we left her any tip at all. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Update: 1/24/12 - Are they trying to pay for their renovation with the smallest, driest wings ever? ---  I frequently visit Native New Yorker because of convenience.  Usually I am pretty underwhelmed.  But now... I don't think I will be frequenting this spot.    The last TWO visits to Native completely underwhelmed me.  In particular, the size of their wings was comical.  And I had to ask for additional wing sauce because the wings were almost exclusively over-fried, dry skin.    I NEVER ask for more wing sauce.  In fact, I prefer my wings to be less messy.  But now, well... I just cannot go back.  I can't justify going to Native when Loco Patron is just a few doors down.  Sure, they are a little more expensive... but I have seen the light and I will not be going back to Native.  Okay... maybe for a beer with other soccer parents... but other than that..."}
{"text":"Needed to kill two hours on a Friday afternoon and knew I could not go wrong with a Native NewYorker. Three things appeal to me when coming to one of these franchised restaurants: wifi, beer and wings.  I needed to work (I teach online) and there wifi was spotty at best. First 10 minutes were great and then nothing. Just spun and would not connect. I even told my serve who just shrugged and acted like my needs were not important.  I asked my server what IPAs were on tap and she looked at me like I was speaking Klingon. She had absolutely NO idea what I was saying. I finally had to convince her to go to the bar and write down everything on tap (not only for me but also for the next poor bloke who wanted a drink that evening!). I ordered what she promised to be a Sierra Nevada IPA but definitely tasted like no IPA I ever had before in my entire life (and that's saying a lot). I would've sent it back but she would've been confused even more.  When I got to Native's I like the wings boneless since I am usually doing a work dinner and need clean hands for my laptop. I got my usual honey hot which had absolutely no kick to them and tasted a little like soggy cardboard. Not good at all.  I watched the manager walk around and greet almost every single table around me, but never came over. Ever. I wanted to call him over and tell him my concerns, but I wasn't sure where to start & I just wanted to choke down the cardboard, chug my flat acid and get the hell out of there."}
{"text":"A group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night, and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples. They ordered some food and drinks, but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their IDs. They did nothing but want some food and drinks. One of them was asked to leave immediately, and the group asked why they needed to leave. The bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder. Eventually the group got up to leave without eating, as the bartender told them they weren't wanted... he said that Native New Yorker is a \"straight bar\" and they weren't wanted there ever."}
{"text":"Went tonight for a takeout order so we could watch Monday Night Football. Order and paid for extra celery & blue cheese( price went up to $1 each! )... Got the order and took it home. The wife wanted to know where the blue cheese was. There was four celery and ONE blue cheese! I was pissed and called them. I drove 3 miles back, and Chelsey who took the order and answered when I called back, told me I was wrong and she personally put three blue cheese in the bag.   Do not ever tell a customer he is a liar. This is what she did. I am about ready to call the manager. My friends do not go here anymore but I've always defended this restaurant. Tonight makes me want to change my mind."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  I haven't been to native in years, but I was performing at the open mic comedy deal.  After my performance, I ordered a couple of beers and some wings.  They had some good craft beers on tap and the wings were better than I expected.  I remember them being kinda meh and small.  They're still small, but they were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  And lot of the comics get giving kudos to the 'owner', so I think it's got a good, local vibe."}
{"text":"Craving for chicken wings, we figured we would come here on a New Year Day. After our visit at the bar today, I really wish that we didn't. I had such a great experience when we came here few months ago. I had no idea what had happened.   When we first arrived, we ordered two Sprites. I literally thought it was regular tab water with bubbles in it. When I realized it was the soda we ordered, we asked to switch them out to Coke instead (how can you mess up coke right?). Once again, it tastes so flat I simply couldn't take another slip. When we asked to switch them out the first time, our waitress looked extremely annoyed with us. She did not apologize once (and of course not the second time neither). When we asked to switch them out again to just a glass of ice water and lemonade, the manager showed up instead explaining that their soda machines have too much ice in it (no apology neither). At that point, we were afraid to ask for anything else. With hopes that at least we could enjoy the chicken wings, they were either too dry or too soaky. I ordered 6 flat wings and could barely finish 4 of them. My friend ordered a dozen and could only ate half of them. The only side dishes, celeries, that came with it were cut so thin and short. The service (other than the annoyed attitude we've got) was basically non-existence. She did smile in the end when the bill arrived to wish us a happy new year. We only tip her because we felt bad for not giving any (we really didn't think she deserves any).   After our experience today, I really don't know if I would come back here again. I didn't expect Durant's services but the attitude we received for the sodas were uncalled for. It was a horrible experience and I hope the owner realized what had happened."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood running errands yesterday and decided to stop here for chicken wings. I got here 10 minutes before it was opened and waited in the car until it opened at 11am. As soon as it was time to go in, a waiter opened up the door to greed us (wow!!) followed by our waiter, Nick, giving us a friendly hand shakes. His services are outstanding and excellence.   I ordered a salt/pepper and Asian flavor chicken wings. They are both delicious. I requested for all flats and it wasn't serve that way. Nick fixed that up for us in no time and looked disappointed that we might not enjoy our experience there (Awwww...). We also ordered the complimentary fried chips for yelpers and it was so damn good!!!!!!  I'll definitely come back here again to try different types of wings."}
{"text":"So here is my final comment on this place. First service was terrible 10 min just to have someone ask have you been helped. So out it comes 25 min after I order. I wanted my wings first but they never came. Instead I get it all at once. Two orders of wings  room temp at best. The sandwich was also room temp. They need to get a manager on the line checking tickets and watching tables. Managers of any Native should step up and do there job. Chatting it up with the regulars at the bar is not work."}
{"text":"I always enjoy it here, good beers on tap, plenty of food to choose from and a great spot to watch the game.  Service has always been ok. I've never had an issue with the food. No complaints here, during the football season I come often."}
{"text":"We went in there for lunch today and had Briana... My husband asked if there were beer specials on Michelob Ultra.. she looked at the happy hour specials at our table and said no and he said ok I will have that anyway...I then looked at the beer specials and pointed out to my husband that that was 3.50 beer specials on Michelob Ultra/domestics... he then walked up to her and pointed out the special and she said that Michelob ultra was a premium beer... WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS NOT.!!!  He then told her it is not a premium she said she was going to check and came back and said it was on happy hour for $3.50 and asked if he wanted it.  Of course he said yes!!!  IN ADDITION OUR DEINKS WERE EMPTY FOREVER!! She never came back!!!  On the positive food was great!!!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and a little busy. Our waitress seemed more interested in her other table. We ordered a side of fries for our son along with our order.  When mine and my husbands food came out we were told that the fries would  be right out. It was taking  a awful long time.  I had looked around  for our waitress or a manager and they were no where to be found. Finally our waitress asked if we were okay and I told her no,  my son never got his food , at this point we were finished  eating. They did take the fries off our ticket and sent us home with some but I'm still upset that they  were forgotten."}
{"text":"Love the service.. DJ Bartender Chris GM & the special crew .. Good beer great service big smiles .. It feels like a joint back in the day they called \"CHEERS\" .. When I walk in hello from the get go .. Keep up the great work Native .. Oh Philene thanks for having that open ear your the best .. Love the NATIVE . Oh did I say good wings .."}
{"text":"Loving their food!! Enjoying the great food. Their wings are always great. The waitresses personalities are super nice & friendly. Everyone here is great. I enjoy being able to sit back & relax. This is a great atmosphere to hang out in."}
{"text":"Lately, in the past month or so, the food has seemed off.  I don't normally like my food super heat hot.  So when its served warm it doesn't bother me, lately its been closer to cold or luke warm. I go for a sandwich, wings or the pizza.  I know why am I going to a place that majors in wings for pizza.  I like the pizza at this place.  I don't mind cold pizza but that's normally cause its in my fridge and the next day, not just brought out from the kitchen, so that was bothersome.   The wings, which are normally good, have been missing something, not sure if the sauce recipe has change or new staff.  I switch it up between 5 (used to be 6) honey bbq, strawberry hot or honey hot, it used to have a good blend not to hot but hot enough and the other flavor, lately its just been hot.    I tried the chicken sliders and was very disappointed, mostly over toasted bun and a tiny tiny piece of chicken served cold.  I thought maybe an over sight but the other slider was just as sad.    I recommend staying with the regular beef sliders or meatball sub.  I feel bad about leaving such a crappy review its not in my nature.  I should just mention it to the managers and hope they can correct things if in fact something is just off.   I still would recommend this particular spot as its a fun environment, place is clean and staff are friendly and courteous."}
