{"text":"Loved my experience there! Been Searching for a good chirashi place for awhile now and I think that title goes to this small,cozy, traditional Japanese restaurant. Their menu is very specialized and selective but quality is on par with more fancy well known places. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic food !! High quality, good pricing but drinks could be colder (beer was stale). Will be back"}
{"text":"Food was  good. Service not so much. Only the one server which makes sense coz it's a small place, however she still couldn't get a handle. Its not like everyone suddenly came all at once. It was 5:30 pm and people were slowly trickling in. People waited forever to get their orders in, and it took about 20 mins for me to get my water. In fact, nobody got any water until the food came. I get you're the only server , but if you're waiting for food to come out of the kitchen anyway, don't just stay in the kitchen. Actually do a walk through and see who needs to be seen and served. She was either literally just standing by the sushi chef waiting for him to finish his rolls, or standing by the kitchen waiting for the hot food to come out. Asked for a takeout container and my bill, she came with just the container. Waited another 15-20 mins for my bill. Too frustrated to ever wanna come back"}
{"text":"Just ate here today for the first time and I've got to say that this is one hell of a place. I highly recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"I remember the days when nobody knew about this place... I've been going there since the beginning.   The food is always fresh. The chef is meticulous as can be and he knows how to make regulars like myself feel special.   Try their tofu appetizer, the sashimi and all the rolls. One of the rare sushi restaurants in the city that don't leave you feeling like \"crap, I should have had a burger instead!\".   The space is tiny and fills up quickly, make sure to call if you are a party of 4+ people."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch because of all the positive reviews on Yelp but were really disappointed. Sashimi were not fresh enough and were not enough diversified. Salmon sashimi occupied nearly half of the whole plate.   The restaurant is too tiny and people are all squeezed together which makes it very inconvenient for people to move and put their stuff, especially in winter time.  The restaurant is totally overrated, if you truly a sashimi lover just don't go there! It is slightly better than those all you can eat sushi shops. As for the price, totally not worthing it considering the quality and portion of food.   However the service is good and plates were delivered fast! That's why I have two stars."}
{"text":"Great little spot with a nice interior and fast service. I got the sushi+sashimi+roll dinner and everything was so fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait 30+ mins for your food, read on.  Party of three arrived when it was full at dinner time. Asked the waitress to CALL us when seats free up. Said about 10 mins. No call for 25 mins. Went back and found other people seated. SHE HAD NO PROBLEM TELLING ME SHE WAS TOO BUZY TO CALL. Don't know if she was embarrassed or something but we were able to sit down in 5 mins. NO WATER OR FOOD FOR ANOTHER 10 mins. Can see other tables waiting as well. Left. End of story."}
{"text":"Came here again for my birthday. My experience was much better than last time. Tried the soft crab shell sushi and it was amazing. Service was 10 times better than last time as food came out much faster. Deserves 5 stars now."}
{"text":"Visited this location again in January 2012, I was surprised to see it is now run by a new Japanese (maybe Korean) owner. The food was so good, maybe a bit pricey, but in my opinion the quality of food is on par with all the high end Japanese restaurants like Hiro in Toronto sans the fancy decoration. Today I went back for a take out, I was treated with free tea, soy pea and some snack salmon shashimi when I was waiting! It is a very cozy place that serves high quality food."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this hidden gem yesterday when talking a random detour walking home. Spotted the \"fresh live sea urchin\" and \"fresh oysters\" sign in the window and walked in to give their uni and ikura a test run: entering the clean, family-run, cozy and gently lit space, I was greeted immediately by a solicitous waitress who gave me excellent service during my entire meal. I noted the pictures of past patrons on the wall, all smiling, happy and obviously well-fed; it was a nice touch and a signal of pride in the business. The intimate space is ideal for a dinner or lunch date, or a small dinner party. Note to parents: this place has limited seating, and not too much wiggle room. If you have squirming children, a crying baby or kids that can't eat a meal quietly, this is definitely not the place to introduce them to sushi. Note: the bathroom is very small, but very clean.       I ordered the live sea-urchin, ikura sushi, 4 oysters and a spicy salmon roll. The sea urchin was as fresh as it gets save for diving for it myself, ditto for the ikura and 4 Vancouver oysters so fresh they were almost sweet. I could have ordered many more, but I limited myself.  I was given an extra oyster, on the house, which I thought was a classy touch.       My only critique, and this is meant to be taken from the point of view of a sushi fanatic, is that the spicy salmon roll was made with chunks of salmon as opposed to the salmon being minced, which I prefer (to-ne sushi, on Queen St. West, does a perfect spicy salmon roll, for those of you who want to compare. Again, this last point is a purely aesthetic preference, as the role was impeccable in every other way).       I had such a lovely and satisfying dining experience, sitting by myself, tucked away in a corner, eating my delicious ikura, listening to the jazz music playing, and watching the sushi chef meticulously prepare my meal.       I will definitely be visiting this location for a sushi dinner again. I suggest y'all do too."}
{"text":"really good?? strongly recommand??the chief is super kind and the environment and dishes are perfect?? also the price is great??"}
{"text":"The rolls are fresh, flavourful and delicious, easily the best sushi i've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place already had such amazing reviews but I just also wanted to put my raving review and say not only was the food great (I got a bibimbap - absolutely delicious, the slightly sweet seseme oil was such a delight amongst the purple rice, quinoa, kale, marinated sweet mushrooms and more) but the service was amazing as well. I initially thought the 'Fried Soy Chicken' meant veggie meat (my bad) so I ordered the wrong dish, but they graciously swapped it out for me. It was very nice. And also, for my vegetarian and vegan friends out there, this restaurant is very free to topping substitutions (my friend didn't eat egg, so she got avocado instead) which is very nice. Overall a great place for the food and service, I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in the city.  It isn't cheap but you get what you pay for.  The place is an absolute shoebox so make sure you don't miss it.  I like that you can see your food being made.  I made sure to watch the chef at work and it made really appreciate the care and effort he put into making our sushi (all very complex rolls).  All in all it's definitely one of the best sushi places I've been to.  Glad I could bring some back to my Dad who was recovering from surgery at the Hospital."}
{"text":"I just tried this Sushi place tonight. Its kinda hidden on Gerrard around the corner from Bay St and I'd been meaning to try it for a while.  I'm so glad I finally did!  I was really impressed.  The staff were very friendly, the place was really clean, and the food was really fresh and tasty.  I totally recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Best a la carte sushi I've ever had. I eat a lot of sushi and this has extremely high quality sashimi. We had chirash which was amazing.   Also the sashimi combo was really good. High quality. 5 stars everytime. Also the staff makes you feel like its a family place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find truly good sushi in the neighbourhood, but this is one of those rare finds. Significantly better than your standard sushi bar."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was not impressed by this place. Yelp reviews suggested best sushi in Toronto and it was far from that. The place is ridiculously small, which affects the experience. I suggest you make a reservation, otherwise it is quite difficult to get a table. There is only one waitress, so don't expect great customer service. Food was average, the rice was flavorless and the sushi was spicy (no warning in the menu)."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner Saturday night. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The salmon don was great and the sushi dinner 2 was ok. Both come with a miso soup, which was not very good. Overall would recommend and will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation. Used yelp rating to go to this place, was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites downtown! A true hidden gem - their bibimbap is to die for. The place itself is small and charming (I usually get takeout) and the staff is lovely!"}
{"text":"Tiny, off the beaten path a bit, but a nice local sushi joint with delicious sushi. One of my favourite places to go for a TREAT YOSELF solo meal out."}
{"text":"A great family owned sushi restaurant. Not a very elaborate menu, but the fish they source is a notch above others in the area. Prices are very good considering the quality."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this cute tiny restaurant.  The owner and his family deliver excellent service.  The sashimi, oysters and vegetables are always very fresh.  The food is priced-well too.   My favorite dishes here include the omakase, sashimi bibimbap, and the steak, grilled shrimp and sautéed vegetable special."}
{"text":"Almost missed it since the signs are pretty obscure,  but it's a cozy little place.   I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap which had a delicious mix of vegetables, and smelled amazing coming from the kitchen. Saturday's special is a free fried egg on any bibimbap."}
{"text":"Second visit. Easily the Best Bibimbap I've had in Toronto -- Packed with lots of veggies and flavour. Great Service. The resterant is decorated eith pictures of thier patrons -- cute. Will return."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once on a weekday afternoon after lunchtime.  Food: I ordered the bulgolgi bibimbap in a hot stone bowl and substituted white rice for black rice topped with a fried egg, this one in particular has cabbage, carrots, sliced zucchini, red beets, along with quinoa and kale. It could have been the black rice or maybe it was the clever presence of quinoa and kale, but this bibimbap was the BOM! Where the rice touched the stone bowl was bits of pleasant crunchiness which added scrumptious texture. This hearty bowl tasted as if it was made with love and the serving size left me full at the end.  Service & atmosphere: I noticed quite a few people come here to solo eat, I would too if I stop by the area. It is a small shop so seating is limited, I do not believe there is a restroom.  Price: For the location, the price of the dish was decent."}
{"text":"Right off the intersection of Bay and Gerrard, this little treasure is a formidable option for an intimate date or a quick lunch gathering. The space itself is very small (seats around 20 persons), cozy, and modest; whilst the service is nothing less than friendly.   The scope of the menu is simple and straight forward; one does not have to spend a lot of time to make a decision. I ordered the Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna roll - they were both fantastic and fresh - along with Beef Gyoza and Tempura. Overall, everything was tasty!"}
{"text":"We were drawn here by the colourful pictures of all that plump, fresh sushi and sashimi. After sitting down we discovered that the resto NO LONGER SERVES SUSHI. It has gone strictly bibimbap and the like. I think they might have a couple sushi type options (i.e. California rolls) still but nothing like the pictures here on Yelp. We were on a short lunch so we stayed, and it was ok, but I was and remain incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 4 and had a great time. Cute little sushi restaurant with attentive staff. Sushi, teriyaki, and bibimbap were all great. Can't go wrong with Sapporo pitchers either!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good. The food is fresh, healthy, and flavorful! I got my food for takeout but I agree with other reviewers that this place is a bit of a whole in the wall. Not sure id really enjoy sitting down but the food is top notch so don't let that scare you away! I had the egg bibimbap and the spicy salmon roll. The roll was good but nothing to shout about. The bibmpap was so good. I'll be back for that!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The restaurant is small, I went there on Wednesday night , not busy at all. But the food is little but pricy"}
{"text":"Wow. I don't remember the last time I had fish this fresh.  Mt Fuji is a small, unassuming little thing with a bit of an identity crisis (is it Epicure City? Mt Fuji? Who knows) tucked away near Gerrard and Bay. Based on past yelp reviews, I went for something with plenty of sashimi - namely the Chirashi (essentially a variety of sashimi on seasoned rice). From the first bite I knew I was in for a treat; the fish is delightfully fresh and selected carefully, the seared pieces done tastefully without overcooking or underwhelming. At $20 for the dish during dinner, it was a bargain considering the quality (and quantity) of the sashimi. My friend had the chicken teriyaki, which was purportedly quite good but did not stop him from eyeing my plate enviously throughout the meal. I have no regrets.  The owner was also very sweet, and you can tell he really puts his heart into what he makes. The service was a wee bit frazzled, likely because it was busy near closing time, but overall the ambience and everything about the experience was lovely.  I will come back as often as I can to my new favourite place for sushi in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi. I like the salmon don quite a bit, though it is a big pricey for the middium sized bowl.  other rolls are pricey too. All taste okay, just not as good as expected it to be."}
{"text":"The place is really small and the food was very tasty. We went there on a Tuesday evening and ate some sushi rolls and edamame. The waiter was friendly but also made sure we are leaving in time so the restaurant is not closing with a delay."}
{"text":"Resto fusion coréen/japonais perdu parmi les batiments résidentiels du downtown, le Mt Fuji est une agréable surprise. L'établissement ne paie pas de mine avec ses 20 places assises mais le service rapide et attentionné vous donneront envie de revenir. Je recommande le menu composée de \"black rice\", saumon et pousses de soja."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews about the chirashi and dropped by before dinner a few months back, and they wouldn't take my take-out order of chirashi because they were slammed. They had a full house but they don't have that many seats, so I didn't understand why I couldn't wait for my food. I was completely starving that day.  Anyways, I gave it another shot the other day. The chirashi comes out to a whopping $22.60 with tax (imagine even more with tip if I had eaten in!), which is more than what JaBistro sells their version for. To be honest, without considering the price, the portion was great for one person. Lots of fish with variety and veggies. Wish there was some dressing for the veggies. The tuna was amazing, esp the red tuna. Salmon was generous and tasted fresh, but just thawed. There was a blood blob on one piece of sashimi.  The sushi rice was well-seasoned and miso soup was great, not a huge portion and not crazy salty. Now considering the price, it's pretty darn steep for one meal and that's what's holding me back from going back there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place was quite good. Its small and gives you a shady feeling and the servers look disinterested but dont judge the sushi and sashimi by that.  The sashimi was so fresh and even though I dont eat sashimi that much I am going to start trying again. Its a bit pricey and we got bento box combo 3 with california volcano. It was great and will come back."}
{"text":"The only missing star is for quality of service. Our table for 2 sat for quite some time before even getting a drink order in, and I also noticed another table experiencing the same frustration. My thought is \"your food is incredible SO GET OVER HERE AND SELL IT TO ME.\" With that said, the sushi really, REALLY is divine. I haven't tasted such quality in a long time. It will speak for itself. We had the \"Sushi dinner 1\" (6 AMAZING nigiri and equally amazing spicy salmon roll. Seriously. Do it.) We also had a Tiger Roll (delicious!!!) and the Mt. Fuji roll (gotta do it, right?) I'm not a huge fan of \"California with something on top\", which is what Mt. Fuji roll was, but it was still ++ tasty. With all that plus a Sapporo from a tap and a lovely lemon-honey herbal tea (fresh rhinds), the bill came to $62. Reasonable and well worth it. GO HERE YELPERS."}
{"text":"The sushi here was decently good. I got the kimbap beef bulgogi maki roll. It was definitely neat to try and it was good, but it definitely wasn't traditional sushi and it left me ultimately unfulfilled haha, so I wouldn't get it again. My low mark is for the service. She wouldn't let us sit at the table we wanted, she rushed my drink order and assumed I just wanted tea, she rushed our bill before we asked for it, and their menu specifically says you can't request extra spicy sauce. Like c'mon it costs you nothing."}
{"text":"I like to think I am fairly well-versed in the Bay/College sushi options. While I had discovered a number of decent, 3-3.5 star options, like Tokyo Sushi on St. Joseph (which is good for the price, but by no means amazing) or Solo Sushi Bekkan on Grosvenor (which is very good, but not mind blowing for how expensive it is for anything else but the lunch special). I checked out yelp to see what else was around, and sure enough, found Mt. Fuji.   Both my friend and I got the the sashim/sushi lunch. We got 2 pieces of tuna nigiri, two salmon nigiris, one yellowtail and one seared salmon belly nigiri. The seared salmon was delightfully charred and fatty. The tuna was ruby red and silky, definitely never been frozen. We each had about ten pieces of the same fishes, plus seared butterfish. All of that plus a somewhat sad miso and boring salad, for only $17. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"A wonderful hole in the wall gem that is family owned and run. We've been going here for years and can't recommend it enough. Try the hot stone bibimbap with some extra red sauce."}
{"text":"I had this spot bookmarked forever (under mt. fuji sushi) and the lesson here is one shouldn't wait too long to visit a spot as they might be closed by the time you visit. To add to the confusion the reviews for prior spot have been added to this spot.  Ah well on to this place. This is like a corner spot (low on ambiance) with a no frills approach. The menu consists of two styles of items i.e. bibimbap and sushi items. I decided to stick to the bibimbap and had the bulgogi version with an add on of a fried egg.  The service is OK but I wasn't expecting much. Thankfully the main came with a bowl of miso soup (much appreciated on a cold day). The bibimbap is OK with a nice mix of items. The hot vessel added a nice crunch to the rice after a bit which is appreciated. The prices are at food court level but the quality is much better. 2.5 stars with a half star added as there is a dearth of decent spots in this area in this price range."}
{"text":"Some of the yelp pics are out of date & they no longer have on their menu (ie. mixed sashimi bibimbap). Ordered beef hot stone bibimbap & salmon sashimi bibimbap. Both were delicious, particularly the sashimi one had some unique flavours. Cozy restaurant with nice staff."}
{"text":"Sure, I'd come back here.   I came here for dinner with two other friends. Someone's first choice fell through, so we ended up here. I was surprised I lived so close this place. Surprisingly there are few Asian-like joints around the area. (Well, as I know of).   This restaurant is crazy small. Right when you walk in, you'll see that there are only a few tables at the restaurant, but other than that, it's a decent place.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Bibimbap on a stone bowl and it was surprisingly delicious. The miso soup tasted not that good, but the spicy chicken was so well seasoned and cooked, I was couldn't stop eating it. They dress their bibimap in quinoa, kale and beets, which I thought was a very interesting choice, and I remember thinking their mushrooms tasted really good. They were cut in super small pieces, and I only noticed it because they looked so curious.   I wasn't that impressed when I left, but the more I think about it, the more I can see myself coming here, especially because the restaurant is really close to where I live.   TLDR; Not that good instant miso soup but delicious spicy chicken! Fusion NOT SO confusion."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and service. The food is nicely presented and full of flavor. It was great to see the sushi chef making your good in the open and on the spot. I highly recommend this place for a nice quiet lunch/dinner, it also makes a great date place."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed after finding out this place no longer served sushi/sashimi as mt.fuji, instead it's a korean place that specializes in bi bim bap. They do serve some rolls and a few dishes with salmon sashimi...since I was craving sashimi I decided to try their sweet n spicy sashimi bi bim bap. The portion was pretty generous for $16, with lots of chopped salmon sashimi bits. It was served cold with chopped lettuce, egg, fake crab meat, cucumber etc. and came with warm rice and miso soup. Had it with the bi bim bap sauce you usually get at korean places....Not sure how i felt about this dish. It tasted like an attempt at fusion korean/japanese but didn't quite ace it. Choice of mixed vegetables maybe wasn't the best match with the sashimi. Their salmon/cream cheese roll did not taste so great, was a little mushy.  Service was pretty good, we got our food quite fast even with only one guy working all the tables! Decor and atmosphere could use a little work. Overall, an ok restaurant...just make sure you're coming here for korean style food and not expecting a full sushi bar menu!"}
{"text":"I have never had a disappointing meal here, despite that being a common occurrence at many Toronto restaurants lately. The sushi chef is very present in the preparation of all sushi/maki/sashimi. He takes care to only give you good cuts. The fish is always fresh. The place is very small and can get very packed during lunchtime. The portions are absolutely perfect, you leave feeling content without being satiated. The service is already quick. They also serve a black rice which I love and can be found at my other favourite sushi restaurant in the city (Koja Restaurant)."}
{"text":"With such a high rating, I've been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a while now. I finally came today with my parents and we ordered three things.   The assortment of sashimi that was common to all three dishes was very fresh and had a high quality buttery mouthfeel to it. The tempura batter was light and crunchy, and the rice for the nigiri sushi held together well. The portion sizes were just alright but didn't feel worth it for the price they charge. The service was friendly but I felt like we were being rushed to leave because the lady placed the bill on our table when we were only 70% finished with our food.   Note: the restaurant is very tiny and tucked away beside the Tim Hortons. Easy to miss!"}
{"text":"Their ingredients are really fresh. I sit in front of the sushi chef and witness my food getting rolled up. It's amazing. Space is cozy, staff is very prompt and friendly. I'll come often cauz it's so near my place :D"}
{"text":"Tried three different rolls here and they were all really good! We substituted the black rice for all of them (there's no extra charge for this which is sweeeeet).  Tiger roll - get this roll if you enjoy sashimi! Lots and lots of raw fish. Very hearty.  Unagi roll - bbq eel and cucumber, was yums  Mt. Fuji volcano roll - I enjoyed the spicy scallop on top,  but not such a big fan of the brown sauce (not sure what it was, but I would've preferred the roll without it. Not that the sauce tastes bad, but just that it's overpowering)  Saw someone eating a bimbap maybe? I saw bulgogi on rice in a wooden bowl. Anyways, it looked and smelled delicious. Would love to try their hot rice dinners."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Very small place with AMAZING food. Worth the effort to get there :-) the chef is rolling the sushi next to your eyes. It is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"A small gem hidden at the corner of Bay and Gerrard. When you walk by you may first have an impression of a run down sushi joint. Like many good sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto, the interior is very homey and sitting arrangements are very tight/little. I think Mt Fuji can only seat 12-15 people at a time.   Service is super friendly. Staff are either family of the chefs or friends. The sashimi here is super fresh. They are known for their Charishi bowls. Lots of different of fresh fish and they're not stingy on portion size. Price is a little high but that comes with the quality you get. Did not get to try their sushi's but their variety in rolls is not as much as other sushi places. They do however serve korean dishes as well (bim bim bap). I've also never tried that before either but it does look good. Overall cute little spot but make reservation if you can."}
{"text":"My go to a-la-carte sushi restaurant downtown. A tiny hole-in-the-wall situated at the Northwest corner of Bay and Gerrard. This unassuming sushi joint has some of the best fish around. If you've only had all-you-can-eat or other mediocre sushi places, this is an excellent place to start elevating your palate.  Though Korean owned, this restaurant stamps a heavy foot on the stigma regarding Korean and Chinese owned sushi (typically cheap, uninspired cooking).  It is similar to Japan-go in terms of price and quantity, but the style of sushi they serve is different.  A single shokunin operation, the food is well-plated and deliciously executed. For those with a big appetite, the chirashi, while being one of the most expensive items on the menu ($20) is the best bang for your buck in terms of volume (very filling, a complete stand-alone dish) and displays a variety of the fantastic fish they have on offer.  The restaurant has been recently renovated, moving from a small family-restaurant feel, to a slightly more modern small family-restaurant feel.  It was, and still is an excellent choice for a date, as the size and spacing is intimate, the ambiance charming, and has smooth jazz playing at discreet levels."}
{"text":"I had the volcano california and shrimp sushi. So delicious and fresh  Can't wait to go back and have more"}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood restaurant. Unbelievably fresh sushi every time. Looks like a family run restaurant. I come here at least once a month and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Small place, but not particularly crowded.  They had a jury-rigged heater, plastic-sheet-over-the-door system in place, which actually worked to ensure a comfortable dining temperature even at the table closest to the entrance - kudos to them, cuz I don't care what it looks like, I just don't want to be freezing while having dinner!  We both had a Bibimbap, and both were absolutely authentic and, more importantly, delicious.  Service was friendly and fast, and the bill was light on the wallet."}
{"text":"Gud. Very gud. Had bulgogi bibimbap and it was fresh and healthy taste because there was kale. The rolls (volcano shrimp tempura and red dragon roll) were saucy and spicy. Would recommend if you're looking for something small and can't figure out what to eat."}
{"text":"I come here often since 2007 with my family of 6. Excellent food. Welcoming service. Relaxed atmosphere. True hidden gem of Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here last night (Thursday) and it was decently packed.   The place itself was pretty small and cramped - I had to squeeze between tables to get into my seat. Also, the front window was broken so they put up a plastic sheet to replace it.  But that's where the negatives end.  I ordered the Sashimi and Sushi ($18) which came with miso soup (oddly no salad). The fish tasted nice and fresh (I don't know how else to describe good-tasting fish).  Service was attentive and they regularly refilled waters and teas.  Overall, it was a nice cozy atmosphere, fresh food, good service. I'll probably be back, but I want to try other japanese a la carte places in the area (Konichiwa and Daio) first."}
{"text":"I recently came here again with a friend for dinner. Everything I've said in my previous review is true and I still like coming to this place. Unfortunately, they changed their menus. This place is now more a Korean restaurant that specialize in Bim Bam Bop. I miss the old menu to be honest. I had really enjoyed the sashimi and sushi dinner sets. They don't have that anymore.  So I ordered the Salmon Bim Bam Bop. I was good and if I am in the mood for Bim Bam Bop, I would come here. They still have maki rolls but the there is no sushi or sashimi anymore."}
{"text":"On our first night from New York we visited this small place that was recommended by our friend. The fish here is really fresh and good. It was so good that we went again the next day! The chef was very friendly and most importantly this place is small and very quiet. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat fresh sushi."}
{"text":"I had high hopes of this place but it left me hanging without any surprises.  It was quite difficult to find it and saw that it was  a very busy night.  Unfortunately, they only had ONE server and this made my experience OK and not amazing.  Food: 3.5/5, we got bunch of sushi and one rice dish.  They were tasty and fresh and the presentation was nice.  Service: 1/5, this is where they failed, it took over 20mins to just order and took longer than that just to get our food and super difficult to pay but mainly because there was only ONE person working.  They need to staff better here.  Ambiance: 2/5, very small place and not much decor or music.    Price: 2/5, a bit pricey for sushi in the area and I expect better service for that price. ($20 per person)"}
{"text":"a big spoon full of nope.  The sashimi don caught my attention due to the overwhelming reviews. So i decided to stop in during a cold night. nope the pieces of sashimi were much smaller than i expected and some were frozen (ice chips and all), others were fishy. i got a spider roll which was quite good (fresh fried crab y'all!). but the seafood udon was also nope nope nope. fishy little pieces of teeny clam meat things I can't even eat - left them there in the bottom of the bowl, also the octopus was super tough (over cooked). don't do it, not worth it, and over priced for what it is.   won't come again. i'd go down a few blocks for ja-bistro instead."}
{"text":"Maybe coming twenty minutes before close had something to do with it but... Good, not amazing, not bad. I feel like I could qualify as an official sushi reviewer for the City of Toronto if such a title exists, and my aluminum levels could probably speak to my qualifications. The spicy salmon rolls could have used a bit of a tighter roll, but good fish to rice ratios. The Mount Fuji spicy volcano roll something something was really unique, and spicy... Like legit spicy. Maybe a little more than my Indian descent mouth felt comfortable with. And the rainbow was very good and colorful. Five rolls (three special rolls) came out to like $60-something dollars. Really reasonable numbers. Great food, but nothing super distinct. The staff seemed super nice."}
{"text":"I cam here after the lunch rush on a Friday, and so service was very quick. But its a small space so it can get crowded quickly! I came during dinner once, and service was really slow. Still, its a cozy and clean spot with good Korean food and sushi. Serves alcohol as well. Good prices, good portions served. Casual spot.   I had the spicy pork bibimbap with black rice. It was really good! A few other patrons ordered that one as well, and they added a fried egg on top - next time I will be doing that! I also recently had their salmon and avocado sushi and it was 7$ for nice thick pieces of salmon!!  If I'm looking for a quick spot to eat or meeting 1-2 friends (and its not rush hour), then I'm down to visit this place!"}
{"text":"It pains me to say that this is no longer the Mt Fuji it once was. Renamed to Epicure City Bom, there is no longer sashimi, and while there are a few sushi roll options, they now specialize in bibimbap. The sushi counter has been removed to create space for more tables, and while it seems the ownership is the same, the stars of the menu used to be salmon don and chirashi, both of which are gone.   I had a sushi roll combo for lunch (California + Spicy salmon, $11), and while the quality doesn't appear to be significantly different from their old rolls, they're nothing special and a bit pricey.   It is with great disappointment that I must declare the end of my love affair with Mt Fuji, once my favourite sushi place in Toronto. Good night, sweet prince."}
{"text":"Great small space with big delicious tastes.  The soft shell crab rolls and mt fuji volcano rolls were packed with flavour and good portions. Friendly staff and reasonable prices will be sure of repeat visits."}
{"text":"I dragged my brother along with me to try sushi for the first time. He was quite nervous, and I quite enjoyed it.  We stopped into this teeny-tiny sushi joint on a Saturday afternoon. As we walked inside, a little old lady greeted us and walked us to our table. The walk wasn't that long since again this locale was the size of Oprah's closet.  We had some sushi...will I go into great detail about it? No. Why? Because I am not a sushi expert either. But I had a roll with avocado and crab meat...my brother went with the safe chicken teryaki filled roll. It was ok, but I have had better.   The cute atmosphere, complete with the little old lady's husband and co-owner making the food in front of you, made for a delightful lunch. Would I go back? Meh...just too many places in Toronto to check out. But I recommend giving it a shot if you are on a budget and not starving."}
{"text":"Absolutely overrated.... The salmon, taro.. Are not that fresh, over price and service is not that good  ... One time thing restaurant."}
{"text":"Boy, were we ever impressed!  On Ryerson campus, a sushi craving hit. Mt Fuji looked promising with 4.5 stars and just a skip away.  My friends were a bit taken aback by the intimate space, but once we sat down and studied the menu, we became excited.   The chicken teriyaki was of the best quality I've experienced at a Japanese restaurant. A beautifully and simply presented sashimi appetizer was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth.  The crab maki roll was still warm and the other rolls were just as scrumptious.   For dessert, red bean and black sesame ice cream (a rarity in this city).   If you're in the area, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Toronto! Excellent service, tasty sushi made right in front of you (not so much rice which is a good good thing!!!!) and great prices. The restaurant is very small so you might need to wait for a table... That's the only con. Otherwise, I highly recommend and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place!  I expected it to be a lot bigger by how highly it was rated on Yelp but the place is pretty small from the outside. Wasn't too busy around noon on a weekday.  I ordered the Spicy Pork Bibimbap and was very pleased with the meal! Portion size to price ratio was pretty good. Lots of flavour packed into the meat and veggies. Generous serving and balance of rice, vegetables, and pork. Loved the sauce options too!  The service was excellent. They gave us hot tea and the waiter came by many times to ensure everything was going well with our meal - really appreciated it and will hopefully be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Good prices and excellent sushi... Very fresh , just the right amount of rice, and they make their own wasabi and soy sauce ...  Chef was super nice and checked in on us a couple times....  Definitely one of my top go to places downtown even though it's a hole in the wall .  Only thing that could improve is the service ... The waitress didn't really check in on us... To be fair, she did seem overwhelmed as she was providing a lot of help behind the counter ... I would suggest that the restaurant hire some kitchen help or another waitress so customers can be properly served ...  Conclusion: service could be better but I'll definitely be back for the excellent sushi"}
{"text":"It's a good place to go for lunch. It's very tiny and there're not a lot of people there. The food was pretty good, all sushi tastes fresh. The service was a little slow considering there are only 6 tables there.  Food 4.5 stars Service 3 stars Interior 2.5 stars Overall 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. That's why the 2 stars, for the sheer disappointment. I always ordered the chirashi don for the fresh, high quality cuts of fish and the amazing sushi rice.   The most recent time though, the fish were clearly the odds and ends of fish left over after making actual sushi and sashimi dishes. The taste was off and the bed of rice had barely any flavour. The rolls are very generic and tempura is over battered to hide the fact the shrimp was tiny. The overall experience of the food was like all you can eat, very cheap quality. But the price is like $9 for 3 tempura shrimp.   I think the highlights of the meal were the salad and miso soup. The environment is cozy and like a small sushi bar you'd find in Japan.  If in the area, go to Japango. It's SO much better for slightly higher price."}
{"text":"If you are trying to find this place and you walk right past it... you wouldn't be alone.  This tiny place has a very small entry and since the building is set right against the sidewalk it's easy to miss the signage.    Once inside this little place there is a large \"communal\" type table for 8 and then 4-5 other tables for 4.  The interior is bright albeit it could be a bit cleaner inside.    I was seated and had initially thought that this was a Japanese place, but I was wrong, it's a Korean/Japanese, with more emphasis on Korean.  That being said, I was really in the mood for sushi.  I ordered gyoza, a Cali roll, salmon/avo roll and a jumbo shrimp tempura roll.   The Gyoza was out first and it was steaming hot.  I had ordered the beef gyoza, and to my surprise it was solid beef inside.  no vegies or anything else.  Next came my rolls.  All served up at approximately the same time.  All presented very nicely and decent sized.  All very good and fresh.  I think my only gripe is that the nori they used to make the rolls is definitely the less expensive type as it's chewy instead of crisp.  Hence your teeth tend to tear and pull the rolls apart instead of getting a nice little bite.    There was only one server working and she did a great job of being attentive.    Overall, the place is well lit and food is good but not stellar.  As noted above, if they used a higher grade nori, I think the rolls would be that much better.  The value for the money I thought was very good too.  I was very impressed with the service and the taste was very good.  Since they seem to be more of a Korean place than a Japanese place, I will definitely have to give the Korean dishes a try when I venture back here."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm, it seems this Restuarant is listed twice on Yelp.  But, this is the location that pops up on my Yelp app when I pull up nearby restaurants so I should review it too.   The food is excellent. I highly recommend it. A little pricey, but the quality is there.  It gets really packed around lunch time and only seats about 15 people so you may have to gets yours to go, but trust me, it's worth it!  Dare I say it's one of the best sushi joints in Toronto? (in my humble opinion...)  Check them out!!!  Here's a link to my other review about them as well:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mt-fuji-restaurant-toronto#hrid:QlhQDH3uwzr1SV8kJDDlOw"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a late dinner after travelling for 10 hours. Amazing food and I didn't feel too full after eating the whole bowl. My only gripe with it is that we didn't get a fried egg with our Bi Bim Bap after we asked if it came with an egg. Other then that still an amazing place. Chicken Bi Bim Bap is a must to have!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with the lunch I had here today. After reading all the rave reviews I wanted to give it a try. I ordered the lunch roll combo, with a spicy salmon roll, that was falling apart and cut into all different size pieces, and a yam tempura roll, which had no sauce like it usually does and half raw yam pieces inside. The bulgogi bento box the table next to me ordered looked really good, so I would consider coming one more time to try that and see if it's any better! Overall not great today,and while the service was friendly, it took quite a while to place my order or get the bill.  3 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Visited this Korean/Japanese joint on a Thursday night in a group of five. I'm glad we had a reservation because it's a pretty small and no-frills kind of space.   I had a really delicious bibimbap (beef $13 + $1 for the fried egg), which comes with miso soup. The soup was quite bland but the bibimbap was stellar - the \"whitest\" bibimbap I've ever had, for all you fusion lovers. My bowl looked like it came out of Fresh, I've never had bibimbap with quinoa and kale! (It was actually really, really good) You can also opt for teriyaki sauce instead of the typical red pepper paste.  You'll be paying a few extra dollars for bibimbap here but I'd say it's well worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Note: The place is also known as 'Epicure City Mt. Fuji' - the signs are a bit confusing.  Small solid joint serving up mid-range sushi and Korean bibim (rice bowls).  It's a tad pricier than what most joints charge (you will not find sauce drizzled deep-fried rolls or $8 bibimbap) - however, the quality reflects the price and prices are very reasonable.  I usually come here for their excellent 'bibim' which isn't like your typical hot stone bowl (for charred rice) with kimchi.  Black or white rice (would recommend going with the black), topped with lots of veggie sprouts and your protein of choice with an array of sauces on the side of varying sweetness, spiciness and sourness to mix to your liking.  A chicken/beef bowl will run about $13, chirashi (sashimi) would be around $16.  Extremely simple - but delicious, fresh and very satisfying.  I don't think I've had their sushi - but they have a daily fresh sushi board and you will various fresh fish and sometimes urchin offered.  So don't fob this place off as low-end sushi just because they offer take-out rolls and bento boxes.  Judging by their chirashi bowl, I'm fairly sure the sushi would be ace.  Service is excellent and it's usually not too busy - so it's a nice quiet and laid back dining experience.  Probably the best mid-range sushi option in the area."}
{"text":"Best Bibimbap I've had but a little light on the meat considering the price and the (lack of) ambience.   Recommended."}
{"text":"Restaurant is terribly understaffed even though the place probably seats under 30 guests. I came on a weekday during lunch and it was full, served by one waiter only (for all 30 guests!). It took a while for us to get tea and then another while to get our menus and then another while to take our orders.  Food, however, is served relatively quickly and was flavorful and well made. Epicure focuses on bibimbap, donburi, and sushi rolls, and it shows. The spicy pork bibimbap I ordered came in a generous serving and was presented nicely. Rice was warm and cooked perfectly, the ingredients/toppings shredded finely.   I do have a problem with their pricing model, however. $11 for bibimbap (extra $2 for hot stone bowl!) is outrageous for their location and menu. Even restaurants on Dundas are priced lower than Epicure.   I would recommend visiting only if you're in the area and cannot walk another 5 minutes to Dundas for food. Great food, but poor value."}
{"text":"The storefront of this restaurant is unassuming, a tiny set of stairs sandwiched between Tim Hortons and another restaurant. However, the space inside is spacious and comfortable. Our group came for a Thursday lunch and they were able to accommodate all 10 of us at a long table.   Their bibimbap was really good. Their bibimbap includes a large range of pickled, fresh and cooked vegetables along with a choice of white or black rice. Get the black rice in a stone bowl, give it a little time in the sizzling container and the little pieces of crusty rice will add another layer of texture. To spice it up even further, there is a selection of hot sauce on the table to douse your bowl with.   This isn't my favorite bibimbap place, but I can see myself coming in the warmer months to get their bibimbap in a regular bowl as a great 'salad' that is healthy, filling, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So this place is a hidden gem. I've passed by it a few times and noticed it was busy throughout so finally decided to stop by for dinner. We had the kimchi fries that came with bulgogi beef as a starter and it was super tasty. The miso soup I could have done without (not crazy about miso to begin with though). The bibimbap bowls that we ordered were just so well presented and everything was really fresh and tasted great. I'll definitely be back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I popped into this place looking for a quick sushi lunch, and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  The owners are very sweet and hospitable. I kinda felt like I was a guest in their home.  SUSHI was excellent. Pricey, but high quality.  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere and the food is so good it's hard to believe!"}
{"text":"First time checking in this place and ordered a take out...not to mention the price is slight higher than what supermarket sells at sushi bar. Didn't taste any freshness in salmon or avocado. Quite disappointed for paying full price on nothing-special-at-all Salmon avocado roll. And the credit card machine required me to pay tips for a take out? Felt forced to tip! Don't think I'll try their Japanese dishes again."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a quick drop in lunch. Does not have an elaborate menu like other Japanese restaurants but it was pretty good. Service was great. Recommendation: Chirashi Don"}
{"text":"Nice small place.  Seats about 20-25ish.  Old building, sparse decor, dark hardwood floors.  Jazz radio.  Sushi bar is not covered in the front so you can see clearly what he's making.  Ended up getting the Spicy Roll combo for lunch: Miso & Salad to start.  Miso didn't have much in it, but was tasty.  Same goes for the salad. The Spicy Salmon roll was probably the best I've ever tried. Big pieces of salmon.  Eight good size pieces in the roll.  10/10 The Spicy Tuna roll was good, not great.  Tuna was a bit on the mushy side.  Six good size pieces in the roll.  7/10  Friendly waitress; no complaints.  For just over $15 after tax/tip, it's not the best deal, but you get what you pay for, which is some quality sushi.  I'll definitely be coming back to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Unfortunately I wasn't completely satisfied with this restaurant, although this restaurant is definitely not bad. This restaurant was recommended by my aunt for lunch, so we decided to have lunch here on a Saturday.  First thing to warn here is to give yourself at least 45 minutes here. There was only one sushi chef the entire time I was here, so the food came out really slow there. It was a good 30 minute wait before my sushi lunch dish came out, as he did the bento boxes that the other people in my party ordered.  The sushi lunch, for $14, wasn't the best I had. There were only 3 varieties of fish, and the fish in my opinion was too thin. It was fresh though, so I'll give them that. There was also a large amount of rice in the sushi, which also gave me a sour impression of this restaurant overall. The california rolls that came with it were quite decent.  As I was about to ask for the bill, the sushi chef gave us another plate of california rolls on the house, which we all appreciated.  I probably won't come back as there are a large amount of sushi restaurants across the core."}
{"text":"Great Chirashi and fresh fish! The restaurant is a small and cozy, and service was friendly. Would definitely come back when I feel like splurging on some good sashimi!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good and comparable to japango. The portion sizes are a bit small but the fish is quite fresh! All the sushi was amazing (although I found out the only fish I can appreciate is salmon). Will definitely return. Their bimbimbap is also awesome and wasabi is fresh as opposed to the tube wasabi!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Never disappointed by this place. Cozy environment. Almost feels like you're in a family's kitchen. If you like watching sushi chefs in action, sit a the bar for an up close look.  The sushi is the best I've had in the city. Try the tiger roll!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the bibimbap upon a friend's recommendation.. I heard it gets quite busy but we were the only table there on a Friday evening.  I had the Bulgogi bibimbap ($14) and it was very delicious. It comes with a ton of colorful veggies (purple cabbage), quinoa, cucumber, mushroom, carrot, kale. The bibimbap was definitely very flavourful and mixed well with the sweetness of the bulgolgi. The hot sauce they have at the table is also very delicious but can be quite spicy..so go easy on it! Portions are pretty small but you could tell a lot of dedication was put into this one bowl of food as it does take a few extra minutes to prepare.  This little restaurant looks quite old on the inside and the tables were pretty disgusting. The edge panels of the tables were starting to come off and there was a crack inbetween the table and the panel... with loads of food remnants from other diners... I observed this with most tables.. absolutely disgusting.  Pricing wise.. for the portion size is pretty expensive for bibimbap but I guess this is in the heart of downtown Toronto.  Would not mind coming back for the food.. but this place could use some new tables!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Toronto! Excellent service, tasty sushi made right in front of you (not so much rice which is a good good thing!!!!) and great prices. The restaurant is very small so you might need to wait for a table... That's the only con. Otherwise, I highly recommend and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Small and pretty restaurant with pretty japanese decor. We got the Mt. Fuji Special Volcano Roll, I got the shashimi bowl and my friend got the chicken bowl. The volcano roll was so good and spicy,  definitely worth it! I loved my shashimi bowl and I like better than the chicken bowl. We could the chef preparing our food, and he was very nice. We also got complementary miso soup and barely tea! And our server was very nice!  I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy pork bento box (daily special) and the spicy pork was great! The spicy pork IS very spicy, but the sauce is tasty with the pork. Mix it together with the rice and the provided spoon and you'll enjoy it. The california rolls were well-made and stayed together, but I wish there were more than 2 pieces in the bento box.  The chirashi don was also good, the fish was smooth and the presentation was great. There were 5 types of fish provided I believe.  Still thinking of the spicy pork even now...  Edit: No matter how many times I try to edit the business info to Epicure City, the Yelp mods refuse to change it."}
{"text":"Purple rice sushi? It looks kind of gross, sounds kind of gross, but my curiosity for trying new things did not stop me from ordering it.   Surprisingly...it was amazing. It didn't have any sort of weird taste, and somehow even complements the fish.   Size of the sushi was kind of small, portions were a bit tiny. I was definitely not full, not close to being full after my sushi. Overall it is a cute, tiny sushi store."}
{"text":"Bibimbap with bulgogi and black rice was superb. Just absolutely fantastic. Spicy tuna roll was decent; tuna is not macerated which might not be everyone's cup of tea but was very good quality. Service was a bit odd- was one of two customers and server was completely involved with conversation with another customer. No water refills, no \"how is everything.\" But that's a minor quibble as food was excellent."}
{"text":"I love their hot stone bibimbap. Fresh ingredients and very flavourful. The bottom layer gets crispy. Mix them all up and add their hot sauce or regular bimbimbap sauce... Yummmmmm :)"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot, and I eat a lot of sushi!  The quality of the sashimi is better than that of fancy white-curtain, overpriced type of sushi bars and even the rice has a delicious, distinct flavour.  It is the same guy making the sushi whenever I go, so he literally must work 70 hours per week (God bless him).    They have recently done some small renovations to add extra seating which was much needed.  I am so hard core obsessed with this place, that the thought of moving to a different apartment saddens me since I will no longer live 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"To be honest, I walked into this restaurant by accident. Who knew such an unassuming restaurant could be hiding such good food.   The sushi is amazingly fresh. The portions are also very generous.  The lunch menu is definitely my favourite.  Highly recommend: Salmon Teriyaki Bento, Sushi Platter  The black rice also tastes phenomenal.  The downside to this restaurant is that it is extremely cramped. It is hard to find a seat during weekday lunch times, as all the doctors and health professionals from Sickkids and Mt. Sinai dine here."}
{"text":"Get the spicy sweet  bibimbap with the sashimi.... holy awesome!"}
{"text":"Mt. Fuji Restaurant is a great spot for sushi in the area! The sushi is high quality and delicious. The bentos are nicely portioned and great for lunch. The restaurant itself is cozy with a great ambiance. Overall, I highly recommend this place.  Note, it's really hard to find due to poor signs. Also it's tiny, so there might be a wait."}
{"text":"YUUUUUM.  I came here on a Friday night to poke hunt at Harbour Front & it did not disappoint.  This is a very small restaurant with maybe 30 people seating.  There was only 1 waitress working and she was excellent. The restaurant was clean and gave off a very authentic vibe.   I very reluctantly ordered the bibimbap sashimi. My sister said it was the best bibimbap she's ever had.  Generally, I don't like bibimbap, I feel like it's a waste of a meal as it's you mixing around some eggs, some lettuce, and a lot of rice and you just don't get the distinct taste of eating everything individually (plus I hate eating raw veggies with rice).  HOWEVER, this bibim has expected my highest expectations.  It was amazing.  There was so much fishie fish fish.  The veggies were light but still added their texture and taste.  The teriyaki sauce was delicious and not too sweet.    I will always come here for my bibimbap."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant that you most likely will miss if you aren't looking for it. The exterior looks very run down so you wouldn't possibly guess that this place serves amazing food. The interior is cozy and seats maybe around 25 people and the wall has a beautiful mural of Toronto. It's not bad for a date night. The lone waitress does a good job. As for the food, their Mt. Fuji volcano rolls and Katsu Don were both delicious and easily some of the best inexpensive Japanese food that I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Me and my husband popped in for a late lunch on a Thursday. I was really excited to come here after my husband raved about the bibimbap. I thought the bibimbap here was phenomenal. We tried the hot-stone bulgogi bibimbap, and it was so delicious. It was served with tons of marinated and raw veggies (beets, mushrooms, kale, cucumber, the list goes on) and a combination of purple rice and quinoa. We each got a fried egg on top, which just added to the richness of the dish. The bibimbap sauce on the table is bomb. I can't wait to come back and try the bibimbap again - it was fresh and so flavourful.   Despite the deliciousness of the food, there are two things about this place that I think take a star off of the review. First, the restaurant itself is not overly clean. The front with the tables is fine, but the bathroom was pretty grungy. A spider actually fell onto my husband's head and onto our table (haha). I would still come back and eat since the bibimbap is delicious and that stuff doesn't bother us too much (since when did a few bugs hurt anyone), but some people might be turned off by that. Second, I was expecting the prices to be a bit lower for a place that gives off the \"hole in the wall\" vibe. I think our dish was $14 plus $1 for the fried egg, and I just expected it to be a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't bad but I won't be going back. The service was friendly. Oddly, the restaurant seems to be going through an identity crisis - they offer Korean bimbimbap and maki rolls, but no sashimi."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's small and cozy, with a nice quiet atmosphere. The waitress accommodated my avocado allergy very gracefully and recommended a really tasty sake. All of the sushi and sashimi was great, as was the katsu-don. They offer black rice, which adds a nutritional boost to your sushi. And they also brought us a little extra roll with sprouts, a nice way to end the meal.   So many downtown sushi places are zoo-ish and offer little in the way of atmosphere, but Mt. Fuji is quiet and relaxed, with date-appropriate seating and attentive service. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome!! Came here for lunch one day with one of my old friend's and we just loved it. I've been back twice since (over the past two weeks). I got the spicy chicken - the taste was so amazing. There were so many different items in the bowl and the burst of different flavors, just melted in my mouth. I would highly recommend this place. My new cheat meal lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try this place after hearing about all the hype!   I ordered Sushi Dinner 2 which comes with nigiri sushi and spicy salmon roll. The sushi was very buttery and fresh. They were very well made- big fast slices of fish on sushi rice that didn't fall apart. I was also very happy to see that they don't give you those cheap/gross sushi that some places like to put in the sushi combos like egg or squid. The spicy salmon roll was good too, but definitely not the best I've had so that was kind of disappointing. They also give you miso soup with the combo and also one side dish at the beginning. I think the current rating of 4.5/5 is a bit high for this place, but this still seems like a great lunch spot.  PS The place is small so make reservations on the weekend."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 4 on a Friday night. The place was packed to the brim and clearly understaffed - there was one waitress working the entire restaurant. She was a bit frantic and rushed, but we did not place fault on her. This was clearly a management problem.  It took over 10 minutes to wave her down every time, and our orders took a fairly decent time to come. One of our rolls (the green dragon roll) took over 40 minutes; we had to wave our waitress down to remind her that we were missing this roll after we completed our meal.   Three of us ordered the Chirashi, one of us ordered the sushi set, and we all shared the green dragon roll. The sashimi and the roll were decently fresh, huge pieces of avocado were present. However, like others have stated, the roll broke apart extremely easily and was not well-constructed at all. The sushi was also fragile and easily disintegrated. Nothing was mindblowing, and at this price point you would be much better off spending your night at Saku instead.   Having eaten at many Japanese restaurants in Toronto, it is absolutely clear that Mt. Fuji does not even compare to the standard set by others in this city. Thus, I am giving this restaurant a 2 star rating to bring it down to a realistic scenario. I would likely not return."}
{"text":"I was thrilled with the dinner I ordered here. The friend who came with me was equally happy with her meal. The fish looked and tasted unbelievably fresh. The avocado was perfect. Even the miso soup was particularly delicious. We loved watching everyone's food made to order at the bar. I tend to be quite snobby about where I get my sushi, and I was really happy with Mt. Fuji. I also loved its quaint appearance and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP! I thought the reviews were too good to be true. Definitely the best bibimbap in Toronto. Although I can't really say whether or not this restaurant makes it authentically, the taste is just absolutely phenomenal.   They use so  many unique and colourful vegetables, I kind of regret getting meat in my bibimbap because the veggies alone were just SO good. They use burdock AND mushroom, along with many other beautifully julienned carrots, beets, red cabbage, (and anything else in season).   The place does take quite a long time to make the bibimbap, but that's because they really invest a lot of time to get the clay pot hot enough for a BEAUTIFUL crisp on the purple rice (which is already a lot harder to get than white rice).  I also added a fried egg, which was slightly undercooked on the surface, but seeing that the pot was SO hot, it was not a problem for me.  They also serve wheat tea which is very nice :) The place does get pretty busy and they only had one server so the service was a little slow, nonetheless the person was still really friendly.  Man, why did I get a hot stone bibimbap on one of the hottest days in Toronto... I could definitely seeing this place as incredibly satisfyin on a cold winter's day.  Don't think I can bibimbap anywhere else now D: Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Steep price for their chirash given that unlike other places, they cut their sashimi into smaller pieces so it looks like there's a lot, but not really..."}
{"text":"Can you spell DONBURIIIII  The Chirashi Don & Gyu and Unagi Don are very legit! The portion is generous and the quality of the food is definitely 5 stars! I eat a lot of Japanese food and the freshness of this place is superb considering the price you pay.   Food came quickly with attention to details! The service was also very good.   A great place for lunch! The food here puts smile on your face, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A very cozy place. No, you won't get the fancy seafood, no, you won't get the fresh uni, no, you probably won't be able to get blue fin tuna; however, the chef is sincere to his cuisine. The price was cheap in my opinion, and the fish was generally fresh. This is a place that you might be able to become a regular. The bulgogi with purple rice was very good (not pictured) probably because this place is operated by a korean family."}
{"text":"Went to Epicure City with my boyfriend last Saturday night... Small place but there was only one other couple in the restaurant, so we were seated immediately. We ordered the tempura appetizer, shrimp roll covered in avocado, and bibimbap with grilled salmon, fried egg and avocado, with the sweet spicy sauce. The food was amazing! Very tasty! They're very generous with the avocado, which I love... Service was fast and attentive, prices were more than reasonable... We didn't have any drinks, just water, and the three dishes came up to $41.   I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy place. Nice ambience. The sushi was good and the service great. Cute waitress I should mention."}
{"text":"It was just \"ok\" nothing spectacular. Fish still was kinda frozen. Don't have much to say about this place. Just very average. But I went in at the last hour so maybe it was just a slow day. Service was fast and good."}
{"text":"The menu is small and the prices are a but high, but the food is good and satisfying when it comes down to it. Good go-to place to fall back on."}
