{"text":"I NEVER leave bad reviews for places. I just do not go back EVER. However, I tried this place with two of my co workers and we all agreed the experience needed to be recorded. We ordered burgers, fries and hot dogs, simple enough. The food was not good. We were disappointed. I called and spoke with the manager \"Karl\" and expressed our bad experience and asked for our money back because we did not eat the food and would gladly bring it back. I got a simple no, \"you cannot get your money back\". He did offer to redo the order but we were hungry and crunched for time.  We wanted our money back to go get good food!"}
{"text":"Wow... ordered a Pokey salad (comes with garlic ginger dressing, or a spicy homemade dressing that I ordered on the side)  i even got a sesame dressing! I was a little taken back on how awesome it was.  I thought at this price I can order a few at least per week to go.  I was impressed/ not only  delivered fresh, the hospitality here is nothing less than 5 .  Only my second time here:  you can't help but notice the turning cooker marinating chicken/ and even rib eye prime gyros with homemade yogurt cucumber Labne !  What the hec.  Employee even offered a sample.  The hospitality is genuine: the  food is prepared fresh. This is the best kept secret in downtown Phoenix!  I wouldn't be surprised if Guy Fieri of the food network rates this as one of the best and becoming restaurants in Phoenix!!!  It's a great atmosphere.  They also play great music, I can't wait to come back!  AMAZING  Thank you for an awesome experience.  I will pass this hidden gem onto my friends, family and clients  can't wait to try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Tried WTFExp for the first time today. It was phenomenal! I attempted to order online, but the site was experiencing some issues. We had a large order, so I went ahead and drove down. I walked in and the place was really clean and looked nice and orderly. The gentleman at the counter was really friendly and offered me a free drink since the site was down and it was so hot out. Our order was out in a reasonable amount of time considering how large it was. When I got back to the office, the order was accurate and complete. I ordered the DTF burger and it tasted amazing! Super fresh ingredients. Definitely plan on being a regular here. Great food, great customer service, what more could you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here already a few times I've tried the philly cheese steaks moms way and the chicken shawarma plate! It was really seasoned well and very juicy! Will definitely be back to try there Widowmaker they say it's 1lb of meat with bacon and cheese!  Oh and they have Kool-Aid on tap! I love me some Kooooolll-Aidd"}
{"text":"I wish I would have been given the opportunity to give you more stars. I ordered through UberEATS after the longest of work days. The delivery time kept getting pushed back but I remained patient. After waiting 50 minutes beyond the delivery time I decided to give UberEATS a call. Apparently the establishment was closed but they forgot to turn off the iPad in the store to mark that they are closed?  Way to go guys."}
{"text":"I just left this place with my 2 coworkers and I never write bad reviews, but I don't want anyone to waste there money and time! We all got a PHILLY CHEESESTEAK AND IT WAS THE WORST ONE I EVER ATE IN MY LIFE! I wouldn't even feed this to my dog! So I don't recommend this places at all!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I waited after my first visit because I wasn't happy with the food. Now I've been there 3 times and tried 3 different things. All unsatisfactory. It's convenient if you work close to there, but the food taste like school cafeterias. And 13 bucks for burger combo isn't cheap either.   All in all, I won't be visiting again, and that sucks because you're so close to work"}
{"text":"So far so good. This is my second visit here, and I really enjoy the vibe. I had the Neighbor Affair, which is a Philly cheese steak with Pastrami....fire. This time I'm getting the Wings...You can find pretty much anything you want here."}
{"text":"********Warning*******Don't get the catfish!!! It is NOT fresh! Actually, what I was served was on the verge of going bad which is unacceptable. I ended up throwing it out after a couple of bites. I will never eat food from this place again. I am going to tell everyone I know also. The health department really needs to pay them a visit soon if this is how this place operates. Serving old/spoiled food to patrons is just wrong on so many levels. Please do better. Don't be so cheap. Start offering good quality, fresh seafood before you end up with a law suit on your hands."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great hospitality, friendly customer service and a wide variety of food choices! All for a good price! $ Lively Atmosphere and they have Sunday football. They have a complementary salad and the food was hot & ready in minutes! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. It was nice going into a place that had multiple counters and choices, more like a food court with okay food."}
{"text":"Just found this hidden gem and we were not disappointed.  Very creative concept with a ton of choices for the entire family.  The Philly cheesesteak was incredible.  The toppings bar and sauce selection was a great added touch.  We will definitely be back whenever in the downtown area! Happy to have found a casual place in the area with excellent food."}
{"text":"This place is so interesting! They have so many different types of Philly cheesesteaks, burgers, wings, gyros, poke bowls, desserts and more! We just went in to grab a couple poke bowls which were amazing! So underrated! Dat fire was bomb.com. Amir helped us behind the counter and he was so helpful and nice and provided amazing customer service! He made our poke bowls so good and suggested a sauce for it and even put mango on mine for no extra cost! This is the definition of a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place! Whether it's a sushi craving, chicken teriyaki, gyros, or the fries, this is THE PLACE!! They have the best fries and good meat. I recommend the wtf fries and the buffalo tenders. And the cheesecake is perfect! I'll be coming back to try the poke bowl!"}
{"text":"The onion rings were crunchy and they had Kool Aid on tap, but my Philly was a insult, hardly worth the $20 spent."}
{"text":"They have something here for everyone. Food comes out very fresh and fast. I got the medium wings and it's definitely a great tasting buffalo sauce, much different than the usual. Definitely a place I'll come back to"}
{"text":"I live in Gilbert, happened to be driving by while in the area and was hungry.  I noticed the signs out front and it really caught my eye.  I was heading to eat at another fish place nearby I had never tried.  I then yelped this place and decided to drive over and try this since the reviews were good.    Let's just say this, SOOOO glad I stopped here to eat.  They have sooo many delicious options under one roof! Restaurant is very very clean too.  It's counter service style.  I wanted to order the whole menu, everything sounded yummy.  I settled on half the menu instead.  Lol.  The guy who took my order was helpful with my many questions and very nice too.  So I ended up ordering fried Oysters, fried Clams and a fish sandwich with Cod (you can choose cod, catfish or tilapia)  Food was prepared fairly fast.  Everything I ordered was VERY VERY GOOD!!!!  They make their bread homemade and it is noticed, my fish sandwich was HUGE!!!  You could taste the freshness!!   I HIGHLY recommend you try this new place.  I wish I lived closer, but I'll most definitely be back and will share with others.    They have a huge, clean condiments bar and several frozen Koolaid flavors as well.  They have coke products on fountain.    I hope they will join Uber Eats, Door Dash and GrubHub for delivery options.  Thank You WTF EXP!! See you soon!"}
{"text":"pretty dam good cheese steak meat was tender beard tasted grate and little crunchy  it was very cheesy just dont eat it right away or you will be eating the ruff of your mouth for days they have so much on the menu it will take me for every to try everything i am going to try"}
{"text":"its over price and the subs arent all that ill rather do a mcdouble than a tasteless $16 steaksub."}
{"text":"They have a very good menu for anything you're wanting to eat, and it's always super tasty. It still boggles my mind how much better their sandwiches are than any other chain or local restaurant that I've been to. I always go home with tasty leftovers since their portions are massive."}
{"text":"WTF, I'm in love! This was by far some of the best fried cod I've had in a long time. Not greasy, the tartar sauce is a total treat, can tell it's made in house."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through delivering for UberEATS, the food looked delicious and the people working there were always cool. Tonight was my first time eating there as I ordered a Philly (the heart burn I think it's called) and the fresh fries. The Philly was on point and the fries are my new favorite food item. Whoever doesn't like the fresh fries needs to get their priorities checked out and reevaluate their life. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the Philly cheesesteak I would recommend it to everyone they also have wings burgers and fish everything is so good there if you are in the area try it out   The staff is always helpful if you are not sure what to order"}
{"text":"Imagine this. You wake up, and find yourself naked on a beach in the Bahamas. Being massaged by beautiful women and sipping your drink of choice. The ocean rolling in, the sweet cacophony of the birds and wildlife only interrupted by asking if you want a refill or more hot stones. Pure bliss envelopes you with every massaging pass, and your mind is warm from the drinks. The sun sets, you wake up and you finally swallow the food you just ate. That's my experience with eating their WTF Fries."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare burger and it was dark grey all the way thru. The bottom of the hamburger bun was soggy and the side salad lettuce was old.  In response to the comment since you can't reply back, If they weren't going to do it medium rare that should have been communicated to me. The toppings may have been fresh, but the lettuce was not. You may put it out every day, but it wasn't fresh. I would've said something, but I took my order to go."}
{"text":"It's definitely an experience. The staff was helpful with providing a couple recommendations. The philly cheese steak is what I ended up getting--large of course. Words escape me how good that was! Will be back because there is just so much to choose from."}
{"text":"Too small. Horrible parking and the Fire Sliders gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Will not be returning not recommending"}
{"text":"Friend and I went one time and the guys are way too laid back, not professional. When you pay for your order on the terminal there is a taped sign that says \" don't f*#k it up? The second time we went, my friend ordered her bowl, we waited approx 20 min, finally some guy asked what our number was and he went to the pok u counter and guy laid back in chair on his cell phone and she was told her food had been sitting there.... yikes poor customer service and never will get our huge offices orders and or my money again and it's a shame, food not bad."}
{"text":"I've never been into this place and I won't be able to unless I'm in the Phoenix area (currently located in Denver). HOWEVER, have a friend in AZ who sent me screenshots of the reviews and responses from the owner of this place. I've been in the service industry for six years and was thoroughly entertained as well as appreciative of an owner who doesn't give into the the pressure put on businesses by websites that offer reviews. Yelp and Google Reviews just serve as domains for people to complain about their ONE bad experience, when the problem could definitely be solved in the store. So, I have no opinion on the food (I'm sure it's great), but I'd give you six stars if I could purely for your management style! Please start a Denver location because I 100% want to work for you!"}
{"text":"I love their food but back in February 22 I put in an order for delivery and I spent about 40$, but when I got my food I noticed that we were missing a burger (hotel affair) and when I tried to call the restaurant I got a recording to email my questions or complaints which I did, well here I am 3 weeks later with no dam response! so they charged me for a burger we never received and didn't even bother to reply to my message, thanks wtf express for taking my money but not giving me my foodI will never order from that place again, fool me once shame on you"}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of choices but it's all good. So if you aren't sure, take a gamble and try something new. The burgers are delicious and very reasonably priced. Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Wow. I loved that there was something for any mood your in. We had the philly cheese steaks; the heartburn and moms way.  For us we judge on bread and meat and this was by far the best bread and meat we've found. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is where I go out of my way couple times a week to have lunch there! There service is fast, it's clean inside, employees are so nice! I love there Philly cheesesteak! I'm not a fish person but there catfish i gotta have. I deeply recommend you to try and you'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"WTF..... the poke was soooooo good!! We ordered way too much food!! Took a bunch home. Didn't even get to try the cheesecake.  It was confusing when we first got there. Haha We live in California, but we will definately tell our friends and family that live nearby. And we will be back! Probably before we go home. Haha"}
{"text":"Indecisive foodies rejoice! This place has a little bit of everything and is perfect for those split decision nights on where to eat.  The service was great, all of the employees were super friendly. It's an order at the counter kind of place but that didn't stop the service from being awesome.  The selection of food was impressive and good prices too. Two of us left full and satisfied for 20$. Great spot for a quick lunch or casual dinner. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went once because I saw a cheesesteak sign. Then I saw signs for like four OTHER options. They're all in the same place and every thing I have tried tastes better than the last. The philly, chicken phillys, wings, tenders, LAWD the fish and shrimp. Don't get me started on the kool-aid on tap! Please make ur way to WtfExp and GO HUNGRY!!! Staff is always a pleasure. Khalid is crazy and fun. Good food, good time. I'll keep going back. And as the front door says.....this isn't the place for a diet lol"}
{"text":"Driven by so many times and so happy I stopped this time. It is a little overwhelming with so many options but it totally covers pretty much anything you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"Literally wtf.. This place has 5 different restaurants in one! I tried the the Widowmaker off the Wtf Burger menu! It was juicy and had excellent flavor it it! I will be coming back! Oh and now they have sushi..! Literally can come here every single day I love it!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop by at WTF Expo, and I want to say I'm very impress. I work down the street and I would always come across pamphlets on people's desk from this place. After getting fed up with restaurant options near by I decided to give it a try. I must admit I was consumed by all the options it offers, but I'm very happy with what I ordered it was delicious!!! I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, Mom's Way, and it was tasty, warm and just right! I also ordered the mango habanero wings which were good not hot at all (for my taste).The wings were enjoyable because I didn't have a runny nose while biting into them. Overall 5 stars is well deserved! I will definitely stop by durning my lunches more often!"}
{"text":"So my co-worker had been raving about this place for Days and so today we decided to order lunch from there. I got to say I was not impressed. My burger was nasty. Not cooked well done like I had asked and the mayo did not taste like mayo tasted more like miracle whip!! YUCK!! NO!! What's worst our fries were soggy Double no!!! My other co worker and I got sick from our stomachs!! Never again!! Please avoid"}
{"text":"I was like WTF is that place? When I stopped it was an amazing experience from start to finish! Thanks a lot, I will be returning soon and recommending to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time, awesome food. Cool set up with the different options of food for anyone's taste...And all the kool-aid a plus. Just wishing they had a kids menu."}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended that I stop in and try their food. From what I could see, they have an array of options on the menu. The guy behind the counter was very chill and his customer service was #1. He made me a very good sushi bowl with salad. It was very very good. And I feel that the price was very reasonable for how big and awesome this salad really is. I seriously considered purchasing one more to eat in a few hours since I am working AZ double shift. I will definitely be returning to this establishment in the very near future. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WTF II. Tried a cheese steak this time. I built a medium one and added a soft drink for $10.85. They offered five types of meat, six kinds of cheese and various toppings. I got ribeye, onions, bacon and American cheese.   The bread (the important part) was soft but cold. They needed to warm it more. A scant amount of cheese (two slices of American) so it wasn't gooey like a cheese steak should be. There was plenty of meat and crisp bacon.   A bit disappointed overall but I think just going with the melted cheese would've helped a lot.   Another update: Tried the burger this time. Ordered a Widowmaker and a soft drink for $11.39. Again, the prices here are high but the quality and portions are as well.   The burger was up in seven mins. It was huge, perhaps a one pound burger. I figured the name was due to the hot items. Nope-it was a heart attack special. The burger was great: juicy, seared and cheesy. The bacon was way under cooked tho.   I seem to keep missing the target!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place to ever throw your money at. Completely irresistible foods of all kinds, even 6 different flavors of koolaid 4teas. Your girlfriend/wife has no excuse to tell you she doesn't want to eat here. Take your girl here on your anniversary you'll get some red wings for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in after saw a post on Facebook. This place has  great food and great service. Food is fixed fresh, fast and is delicious. Perfect for a lunch run any day. Authentic Chicago style gyros, and a very good menu."}
{"text":"We drive by this restaurant every week on my way to the airport and decided to stop in last night for dinner.  It is a little overwhelming at first as they serve wings, cheesesteaks, gyros, burgers, fish & chips and poke bowls - so many choices!    We ended up with a gyro, dolmas, cheesesteak and a side of fries with cheese sauce - everything was made fresh and very tasty!  We'll definitely be back on our way to/from the airport for its convenience and good quality food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Ordered thru grub hub. Food was really good with good size portions. Ordered zucchini, mushrooms, 3 piece fish dinner and a 5 piece fish dinner. The disappointing part was that neither one of us received our coleslaw which said it comes with. Tons of fries but were pretty soggy even though I requested them crispy. Asked for tartar sauce and lemons. Got one tiny thing of tartar sauce for a total of 8 pieces of fish and received no lemons. Everything tasted good, just disappointing when they don't send things your supposed to get or request. Will probably order again especially when we're craving fish."}
{"text":"Ever since the change & new owners, I love this place!! Service is quick even when they are full. Drink variety is GREAT! Food is larger portions than expected & tastes good! Gyro & their seasoned fries are my favorite choice."}
{"text":"Tried WtfExp on Memorial Day on simply because we were searching places on Yelp. Just walking in the atmosphere is fun and welcoming  I had fish and shrimp it was amazing. I highly recommend it. My daughter had the gyro and loved it. Then my lady brought it home with the Philly cheesesteak fries which everyone helped with.   Overall the food, service, cleanliness was top notch. Most of all I will be back."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff ; when I called to place an order someone picked up and said \"911 what's your emergency \". After I told the person I wanted to place an order for pickup I was hung up on after being told that they won't be able to take phone orders for 60 days when I had the person on the phone. Very unprofessional and senseless as I had placed an order the day before. Don't even bother calling them at all . The food is great but these people clearly lack business sense and professionalism."}
{"text":"Variety of different foods to pick from. Everything is fresh and I've enjoyed everything I've tried so far. Plus they have a Kool-aid on tap station, you gotta love that!Definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"Best place to go for a variety of foods. They have everything you could ever want. They have 6 different koolaids yum. Will definitely be back for lunch. I had the neighborhood Affair and it was yummy. My wife had the poki bowl and that was really good too. I would recommend both of those.   The vibe inside the restaurant is really good. They have music playing and the staff is awesome. They have a great selection of toppings and sauces for whatever you order. It's a great go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"I love the Cod fish, shrimp & french fries. Always good and the orders comes out very fast. I guess I come in at the right time of day. I never tried anything other then that. The restaurant is always clean. The cashier is always nice."}
{"text":"This place has really great food, and even better service.  I recommend for any one in the mood for a twist in food and service to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The name fits the food! I got the build your own poke and it was phenomenal. The fish was fresh and everything was so tasty. Can wait to try the rest of their items on the menu."}
{"text":"Our First time here. Very customer friendly with great suggestions.  Nice warning at the door \"Definitely a bad place for a diet\" Ha! Perfect!  Opens at 10:00 even better. Perfect lunch time for those that start work at 04:00  Fish & Chips Gyro's Philly Steak Poke Bowls Wing's Burgers and Fries, OH My!   *WARNING* They have KooL-Aid on Tap. Boom!  Started with the Dat Fire Poke Bowl  WoW! Outstanding. Ridiculously good!  10 being the best, I rate his poke bowl a 10!  And Fired calamari  Now have to make our way through the rest of the menu.   Great place, friendly staff, very clean place. Perfect place to take friends that can't agree on anything to eat. There is something for everyone. What more can you ask for?  *Mash the LIKE button !  You can follow K15 Adventures on Instagram and Facebook. See where we are headed next.  Typically, remote destinations where the journey of Fishing, Kayak Fishing, Hunting, Camping is the principal goal with, some shenanigans thrown in."}
{"text":"Something for everyone  Its like a foodcourt, there is something for everyone. You can have the Wtf Burgers, a Philly, Fish & Chips, wings, or Gyro. On this visit I went with the Fish sandwich and fries.  I had a choice between cod, catfish and tilapia.  I went with the cod, served with home made Tartar and cocktail sauce.  The fish was golden, crispy, and not greasy at all, it was very tasty. My sandwich was served with seasoned fries. I am not a fan of seasoned fries, but these fries were fresh, hot, and crispy. My lunch companion with a hamburger and fries and really enjoyed her meal.  the restaurant was very clean and has a great selection of entrees, including a lineup of Kool-aid flavors. WtfExp is a great lunch spot to go by yourself or with  a group of people because of the variety."}
{"text":"Wow, cool concept! Love the attention to detail. Very broad menu with something for everyone. Wanted to try one from each of their main categories, but guess we'll just need to keep coming back to sample them all. The food we had was fresh, good and large portioned. Good luck to the person(s) behind this well thought out joint!"}
{"text":"This is the best philly I have ever had!!! I was able to build my own, made it so good the guy at the counter had to make himself one. I pick up orders here a lot for work. My car always smelled so good after I picked it up I had to try them. Trust me you wont be disappointed. For 12 bucks I got the large philly combo that had huge order of fries and a drink. I shared with my girl cuz I am nice like that or cheap, whatever. And we both got super full. This is the only place I will get my phillys from. Now to try the rest"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something that we don't have back home....the front door said it all \"This is a bad place for a diet\" Great food and even better service."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and this place did not disappoint!  I ordered the WTFFries with a Heart Burn philly cheesestake sandwich.  I barely made it half way through the fries and I am sooooo full!  These fries are the best I have had in Phoenix!  I will have to write a review of the cheesesteak a different time.  They even have 6 flavors of koolaid on tap, like who does that?!?!  This place!!!  They are 5 different restaurants in one, and they have wings, so NO ONE will be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here! A little confused about the 4 doors but went in and straight to the counter. I ordered what I thought was a burger since it was in the burger section and ended up getting a philly. Not bad but that's what I get for being a spas! When i was almost done one of the worked came over and gave me a free Crispy treat. I made the mistake and they still took care of me oh and let's not forget they offered to make me a burger. But I'm stubborn haha!   Anyway food was good fries were best! And now I have to come back for that burger!   11/15/16 So glad I came back for the burger! Such good flavor and I liked the meat quality. I added onions tomatoes, lettuce, jalapeños and pickles with mustard and ketchup.  I am definitely more happy with the burger!  One thing I can just say is that the restaurant is in direct sunlight and it's freaking hot in here. Maybe some blinds?  Other than that this spot is picking up in popularity so don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Well, this review is a delivery from #WtfExp, a place I use to absolutely love.  I use #Grubhub for this one and they deliver no drink and bread and meat only for the sandwiches.  This lackluster performance cost me $35.00.  Now, when I go to complain that all the veggies have been left off the two main sandwiches and no drink was delivered, we got a drink, finally.  (The delivery driver said the restaurant was not busy at the time.) The manager said, sorry no returns or exchanges to correct the order.  What appears to have happened is the menu lists the ingredients for the food and offers choices and additions.  My add was mustard for the burger and chose pastrami and steak for the sandwich.  The order comes with mustard ONLY on the burger to beat it all, and meat and bread for the sandwich.  Who eats meat and bread?  #Grubhub, to their credit, did give a $15 discount for the inconvenience of not getting what I ordered.    This is the second time my order was incorrect from #WtfExp.  Same thing happened to a previous order with sandwich (meat and bread only) and I ordered it again and got all the veggies just fine.   The folks who work these orders don't understand that items are defined on the menu for the customer and we only get to select the add-ons or choices below the item on the order ticket.  Under no circumstance should a customer have to add on all the ingredients they already expect to be there, unless it says \"build your own\".  The incorrect orders caused me some distress with a feeling of hopelessness to solve the problem.  The take away from my review is to BEWARE, if you order thru #Grubhub from #WtfExp, the manager thinks you need to add on every ingredient of a menu item or its meat and bread only for you!"}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place and are here at least once a week. We have tried almost everything on the menu. Tonight was our very 1st time having an issue with our food. We took our food back and without any hesitation they made our entire order over again!! They also told us we could keep the food that was messed up. Before we left WTF my husband and myself decided that we would give the food that was messed up to a homeless person, after all there was nothing wrong with the food, it just wasn't what we ordered. Hopefully the man we gave the food to enjoyed it :-)....Nonetheless we will be back to WTF soon!!"}
{"text":"This spot has the best fried shrimp in Phx. Love the friendly staff/owners.  They give you samples to try from their wide variety of menu such as Philly Cheese stakes, Hot wings, sushi, fish n chips, gyros and desserts!  The shrimp, catfish and wings are the bomb!  Great customer service and did I say the fried shrimp are the best!!?  It's a food court off Buckeye!"}
{"text":"10/10 would go again! Poke bowls, cheesesteaks, phat a$$ burgers, gyros, you'd be dumb not to go. Kool-aid and cream soda as well as the regular drinks. My burger was so big i had to sit for 20 min after cuz i was so full. If you cant decide what to eat or where to go this is the place man. Good music and a trendy/relaxing atmosphere. They make you feel like family, any place like that has my vote."}
{"text":"The first time I came with a friend and ordered my food and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes later and my friend had finished eating I gave up and left.   My friend talked me into going again but this time we ordered online, his food was ready when we arrived mine took over 20 minutes.  So there must be something about me these people don't like because they don't ever seem to want to make my food, I guess they don't need my business cause they are usually always pretty busy, I recommend trying them out because they add some variety to the area but make sure you take a long lunch."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're on a diet like it says on the front door. The people here are super nice and the food is perfect comfort food on those days it's NEEDED!!"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place!! Awesome cashier dudes, big and open space, fair prices overall great environment. I ordered the wtfburger and got it naked and plain... But than i realized there is a \"dress your burger\" stand!!! Super cool and fresh ingredients. Recommend this place. It wqs my first visit and won't be the last!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after work ordered the moms way which was a Philly cheese steak. The sandwich was ok just felt like it could have had a little more flavor to it. To drink I got the tropical punch slush that was way too sweet for me. This place has a big variety of food and desserts so most likely I will be back"}
{"text":"Love love this place ! Everything I've tried so far has been amazing . Went in on Friday tried the new sushi poke-bowl they had it was on another level . If you haven't tried this place out yet you have to defiantly a place to go! Oh and one more thing those fruity pebble snacks they make just hit the spot !!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is a hidden gem in our ugly desert. WTF is 6 different restaurants all rolled into one. You can get American, Mediterranean, and Asian food all at one counter. We got a Philly Cheese Steak and an order of kick ass chilu cheese fries. This is the only place we have found in the valley that makes a homemade cheese sauce and omg its delicious. Adam was a total rock star and helped us decide what we wanted. If you want a truly amazing experience then you must come to WTF!  OH and they have Barqs red cream soda. I am lovin this ish..."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! It's very easy to pass by and miss it, so keep your eyes peeled! Everything on the menu is great. Service is phenomenal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight & the wings were bomb. The hot is hot! My mouth is still on fire (in a good way) the fries were great & the kool aid was perfect. The guy at the counter was also very nice.  Definitely going back to try the Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I was a bit confused when I first showed up since it looks like 5 separate places based on the signs, but once I got inside it all made sense. The menu is very overwhelming, with so many amazing things to choose from, so make sure you are in the mood to cost.  The burgers are pretty good, high quality meat and cheese, and topping bar has a ton to pick from. Now the cheese steak was amazing.  Top quality beef and cheese, and the bread was so fresh and perfect.  The large was gigantic, I could only eat half, but it was super good as a leftover.  A funny thing is when you are eating you get to see all the people standing outside looking at the signs trying to figure out which door to go into for what did they want, even though they all lead to the same place!"}
{"text":"Good variety of options. Went with a large work group and each of us were able to get something different. Quick service. Fun atmosphere.  Parking sucks though so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars so I have a 4  This is my first time coming to WTF after seeing it on the news as a great place to eat. I thought the staff was very friendly and I really enjoyed eating there and I rarely like eating inside fried food spots.They were so kind as to bring me extra shrimp with my order just as a courtesy and I thought that was really cool. It's really nice how they combined like four different restaurants in one spot so you have many options and the Kool-Aid along with other soft drinks is a great touch. I'm very familiar with fried fish and shrimp as my family used to own a restaurant when I was younger. I would say everything was overall tasty especially the fries however the shrimp and the fish had a little too much coating. Shrimp and fish are light textures so overload of coating and seasoning can seem a bit overwhelming. Overall, it was good I would just say a little less would've went along way. My husband and I definitely decided we will give this place another try and maybe update our score as well."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch. Been there everyday last week. Steak Wtf fries are sinfully good.  Love the atmosphere and the staff are great. Definitely a place everyone should know about"}
{"text":"Food www amazing and staff were extremely friendly. After ordering the chicken shawarma, I experienced the ahi poke bowl which was fresh and tasty. I will be back for the burgers and fish and chips next!"}
{"text":"How can you not like a place with Super Good Kool-Aid... Plus, the Owner loves to make dessert with cereal.... does NOT get any better than that.  Super Sweet People.... We'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"I have to give this place five stars the catfish was amazing it was really tender and moist and the crust was cornmeal and crispy excellent! The shrimp was very good as well and you get a large portion for a small price. They have a Kool-Aid bar 6 different flavors that's crazy! I also got one of the Philly Sandwiches to go. It's called the heartburn it has Philly steak onions mushrooms with pepper jack cheese Monterey cheese and Cheez Whiz and this thing is huge! The cocktail sauce for the shrimp is a little spicy. Also the french fries were really good I like the seasoning that uses so much like a barbecue it was they were really good. I will definitely be back! Winner winner catfish dinner!"}
{"text":"As an UberEats driver, I deliver a lot of their food I Now understand why ! ate there for the first time yesterday ,Philly cheese steak was simply amazing. Always good service very clean friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is cool wasn't really busy food is great it's a little pricey but I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"This was the best philly cheesesteak I've ever had!!! Stopped in from Dallas and on my way out I randomly tried this place. Definitely an adult theme and maybe a sense of to churchgoers. Lots of items to choose from, :)"}
{"text":"4 stars is about right. This is a great place to go when no one can decide what they want, there's something for everyone! Only problem is, everything comes from a jar. Not that anything tastes bad, but it's exactly the food from a home made BBQ. Buns from a bag, condiments from a jar. It's basically like if you started your own business supplied from food you just bought at the grocery store. Again, it's fine. But with some actual work put into it, it \"could\" be a lot better.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've done delivery from here a few times but this was my first visit to the restaurant. It's just as awesome! The portions are outstanding and the poke bowl has plenty of awesome flavors. Dat Fire has a lot of spicy krab (love my imitation crab) and tuna/salmon...bigger portions than competitors like AhiPoke. I've had the cheesesteak before too which is great....my roll was soft and the cheese was authentic Philly. Hands down, it was the best cheesesteak in the valley!  If you like macaroons, those are also wicked good. One restaurant with a TON of choices and it's family owned and operated....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have had many cheesesteaks. This was the worst. Asked for mayo they put it on the steak instead of on the bread. I couldn't wait for this place to open. So disappointed."}
{"text":"This awesome restaurant has anything you could ever want! Very friendly staff. Family owned and operated. My wife had the philly cheese steak and I had the fish and chips with shrimp! Of course we had to have some kool aid right off the tap...my new go to place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"WftExpress lives up to half its name; \"what the fuck?\" Pay $14 to wait 20 minutes for a Philly that nobody in the kitchen decided check the ticket to see if the order was right (If the ticket was even right). First time there I ask for no bell peppers add mushrooms, still had pepper. Second time there I ask for no bell pepper, add mushrooms, extra cheese- had bell pepper, no mushrooms. What the fuck? And what exactly is express about waiting in a half empty dining room for 20. You do know many of us only have one half-hour for lunch, right?  Never going back.  If you want a fun gimmick and excellent gourmet food, I highly recommend Chëba Hut."}
{"text":"Best. Place. EVER. Sam and Amir are incredible and the food is SO delicious. Recommend the poke - especially the raw nachos. And the OREOS. Will definitely be coming here at least once a day. Okay, maybe once a week but still.   Thank you so much guys! See you soon!!"}
{"text":"The owners are very kind! We have became regulars since it is close to our work place and they never fail to fill up our tummys. They have a great variety of burgers, subs, and sea food. Try one of their phillys today, really excited :D"}
{"text":"OMGWTFBBQ it's WtfExp! I LOL'd a bit when I heard the name of this place. FWIW, this is a GR8 place for those that may work around this area and want to go somewhere with multiple options to please various palates. FYI, your options are fried seafood, Mediterranean, burgers, cheesesteak, wings, and even poke bowls. (OK I'm done with the annoying internet acronyms for now :) )  After browsing through the mind-boggling variety of options I finally decided on sharing a cheesesteak (The Neighbor Affair) and the Mo's chicken shawarma fries. We redeemed a check in offer for a free drink which allowed us to indulge in some Kool-Aid from the many flavors available. The peach mango flavor I had was quite refreshing and good. Other drink options from the fountain area included various iced teas and sodas.   The food only took a few minutes to make and looked delicious. I enjoyed the flavors of the pastrami and thinly sliced beef with melted Swiss cheese and grilled onions. I would have liked more onion in my sandwich though to provide some more textural difference. The bread was soft and went well with the meat and cheese.   The Mo's shawarma fries were an admirable size, filled with chopped chicken, sauce, peppers, onion, and mushroom. Unfortunately the mushroom was an unwanted item that wasn't in the menu description and there was actually supposed to be tomato in it instead. The peppers and mushroom both tasted like they were from a can or jar, and I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. I did enjoy the lightly crisp fries though. The fries also came with a side of hummus. Quite honestly I really hated the hummus. It had a weird consistency of goopy texture with small chunks dispersed throughout the dip. It had a strange metallic aftertaste to me. I could only take one bite before deciding to take mercy on my tastebuds.  In general, I'm not sure I would get something from the Mediterranean side of this eatery based on what the shawarma fries tasted like but I would be up for trying another cheesesteak. L8R, WtfExp!"}
{"text":"This place is the best thing ever created. The line is a little long but its worth the wait. I had the buffalo wings and the catfish and chip. Great customer service, super friendly. Very clean. So glad they took this over!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today........this place is the bomb....like off the hook good. Food is fresh and full of flavor and the best I have had in a long long time. Customer service is great as well. Will definitely be a return customer"}
{"text":"I walked into this place wanting a good burger and maybe try out the fish. Everything looked so good in the inside and outside. This place had homemade recipes and authentic food. It had fish, burgers, phillys, gyros, and even hand rolled SUSHI. Since it was just me I ordered the widow maker, which I recommend to any one who goes, and a two piece catfish. The prices are not too bad and are really affordable. The cashier is also really nice and polite when waiting for me to get my money out. I walked over to the end of the restaurant and got my drink, and next thing you know it, my food was ready. I sat down and enjoyed my meal which tasted like they said \"TASTEBUD OVERLOAD\". I honestly felt it all in my mouth. The burger was just so juicy and filling. And the catfish had this excellent crunch to it that me just want to jump up and down. Overall, the customer service is great and the food is fantastic. Definitely going back to this place for more food and recommend this to you!"}
{"text":"The beef gyro is amazing along with seasoned fries. It's good to know there are still a few local owned shops around Phoenix.  They have Philly Cheese steaks and burgers too."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Within just a few hours of me writing my previous review of my bad experience via Postmates, the manager sent me a message asking me to give it another try. The location is just around the corner from my work so I went in to give it another shot. Carl (manager) was SO nice. He made my new PokeBowl for me and was very professional and kind. I really love the \"chillax\" vibe of the place - SNOWFLAKES BEWARE! Hahaha! Not to mention the place has like 5 different cuisine options.  But back to the PokeBowl - he was right, I had a freak bad experience. Because this new PokeBowl that Carl made me was DELICIOUS. I would recommend going IN to the store vs. ordering through an app, that way you can see all of the options available. I will definitely be going back - in fact, I am going there today!"}
{"text":"Really really good food, best gyro I've had and they're really nice people!! Highly recommend stopping here and grabbing something to eat."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. I got a Heartburn delivered with fries and coleslaw. All items exceeded my expectations. I'm picky, and I don't post unless I'm impressed.   If you're on the fence, go for it. After trying the food, I don't believe any of the negative reviews. They're either trying to deal with a stick up their hind side, or plagued with a fowl disposition. Either way, I feel sorry for them. My experience was very positive."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazingly delicious and the service perfect What really makes the place extra special is the family behind it . It all starts with the boss Sam and his lovely wife and his 2 wonderful boys who I have had the pleasure of knowing for quite a while Since the Quik Stop and Marlyns Fish & Chips on Central Ave So when your on your way to the airport or coming home from a trip stop by WTF for a great experience of food fun and family   Alhamdulillah...Mashaallah"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I eat here 1-2xs a week! So glade we have a place with varieties! Everything I have tried have tasted so good! Fat Girl Heaven"}
{"text":"WTFEXP is pretty cool.  When I first came upon the restaurant on Yelp and bookmarked it, the photos didn't do it justice.  The restaurant is a little off course from the Main Street however it was a pleasant surprise to see how it was designed.  The complex looks new and the idea of WTFEXP is sort of original.  If you have ever been to Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler then think of how the inside looks.  However with the WTFEXP they literally have 4 different restaurants in one.  The one I chose was Philly Affairs.  I forget the name of the cheesesteak I got however it had chicken and steak, mushrooms and onions and cheez whiz. It was pretty good, nothing mind blowing or out of this world.  But very tasty, and the French fry seasoning they use is pretty damn good.  They also had a cool aid station with like 6 different flavors, I got the pink one (forgot the name) lol. The cashiers name was Khaled.  He was a good kid, I let him know that I was kinda overwhelmed by all of the food items on the menu and he took the time to answer my questions as a newbie there.  I really enjoyed the service here and would recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for a fulfilling bite from having a munchie attack or something to that extent."}
{"text":"I regularly get the poké bowls and it's always tasty and fresh. The staff are always friendly and they really care that your food is good and that you have a pleasant experience. Love the sense of humor here and there are so many tempting items on the menu -- I keep coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place often on my way home and last night I was craving a cheesesteak. So, my wife, son and I stopped in. We were amazed by the many types of food options they had. I had the cheesesteak and my wife had wings. Both were grade A delicious. Yummy!! Pictures don't do justice you have to see it for yourself (:   Oh and the staff is super professional and friendly. My son knocked out soda and a staff member was over to clean it up ASAP. You guys rock! The cashier even gave us 2 free fountain drinks. I'm definitely going back for their Poke bowl and I will also spread the word on it."}
{"text":"I said to myself, W.T.F. is WTF EXP? Which later I found out that WTF stands for \"What the Flavor\" Well first time coming here was a bit overwhelming because they have huge menu of EVERYTHING! I was so amazed with the variety of different foods in one place. Great concept WTF!   I ordered their catfish and chips and I was really impressed! The batter that they use is really crunchy and flavorful. The fish it self tasted fresh and it was moist. It's was way better then the Pete's Fish and chips that happens to be down the street from WTF. After devouring that catfish I decided to forget Pete's and come here when I need my fish fry fix.   I have been to WTF several times with co workers and can say that their hasn't been any issue! Bravo WTF! Keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"This was the worst burger I've ever had and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.  I just came here to warn you, DON'T DO IT.  It tasted like a pre-made, frozen patty that had been sitting out all day after it was cooked.  Thinking about it again, the whole thing tasted like it had been left out all day; super dry, chewy, stringy lettuce.  My husband got fish and chips which he also didn't care for.  He did say the fish (tilapia) was okay.  Definitely not worth the money for the quality of food.  The only positive I have is that the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"I tried the poke bowl here and it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten I highly recommend trying this!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. I've now tried the chicken shawarma, fish and chips and the WTF fries. All were great, service was nice and quick and the fries here are so good! Fun place with a LOT of options so everyone is happy and a really healthy portion of food!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family came here cause of good reviews but wasn't what we expected.  Poke bowl rice was regular white rice now Japanese rice. Husband got the sandwich and bread wasnt all that great. French fries were good though."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the serv.is good as well , I ordered via online and picked up while I was downtown.....i would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This was fantastic! The food was great and fresh, the customer service was incredible. My husband had been going here for the last couple of weeks and kept sending me photos of the food. I was super jealous because it always looked delicious.   I finally got the chance to eat here and their food tasted as good as it looked.   Very impressed, very pleased, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was very good I had the philly burger good quality burger very tasty ... also tried the fish that was ok but ate it the next day so didn't get to try it fresh but nice burger bar very clean nice"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS TWO THUMBS UP. My favorite place in phoenix. I always bring new people here just so they can see how RAD this place is. Kool-Aid on draft. You can't go wrong. The burgers are bomb the Pokey bowls also the carrot cake was so good. Plz stop on here. The owner is a rad dude. He will take the time and talk to you about any question you have. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Omgosh The best Shrimp, butterflied and seasoned to perfection. I don't generally eat cod, but here it's delicious. Definitely recommend. I ordered the Po boi Shrimp Hoagie."}
{"text":"My company is about ready to open a new office just south of the Suns stadium.  My boss and I ran into this place.  The people were inviting and very helpful navigating us thru their Huge menu!  We got burgers and they were great!  Definitely going to stay on the lunch rotation short list."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. You go in and there's so much to choose fun that it can be overwhelming at first but anything you get will be good. The cooks seem to well skilled and diversified to handle such different foods. Their salad bar/ burger dressing stand has great fresh options. I love that I get to finish off my already awesome burger with whatever I want! So why the 4/5 stars? Well the girl that was up in the front taking orders is not very personable you can tell she wants to leave and when we walked in she was on her cell phone giggling and we had to wait for her to finish her last view of whatever. And then we go to find somewhere to sit and every single table that was available was super dirty with food crumbs and oil stains of the previous people. Meanwhile the girl in the front is just standing around on her phone or talking with the guys from the back. As a business owners perspective, down time = prep time so if it's slow my people better be cleaning tables and sweeping. And this isn't the first time I've walked in and all of the tables were dirty. This is the third time I've visited them and it's just similar thing. Great food yet dirty atmosphere."}
{"text":"This spot is my go to for Saturday lunch. Service is great and the employees actually remember you which is really welcoming. I just asked for falafel sauce with my sandwich and they remembered I wanted ranch too! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Pretty damn tasty cheesesteaks but the fried oreos were out of this world. I can't stop thinking about them I haven't gotten any work done in days."}
