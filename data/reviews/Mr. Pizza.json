{"text":"I ordered a medium cheese pizza for pick up. The person on the phone gave me a price. Then when I arrived the counter to pick up, the casher charged me 50% more than the price they offered me on the phone. When I tried to tell him that wasn't the price his colleague had offered, the casher pretended not his responsibility to help me out and have nothing to do with it! Worst pizza and customer service in the neighbourhood :(((((( super disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Never again  Pizza delivered 48 min late with out a simple apology .!!!  Food was awfully cold and disgusting"}
{"text":"Over-priced, under delivered   You can make better pizza at home. Not even close to frozen super market pizza.   $4 a slice?!?  And it's not even that good!  I really wish there were other pizza options in this area. I love pizza but this is the only one close to me.   Someone HELP!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food, went in everything was super stale. You might as well microwave frozen pizza.   Over priced for garbage"}
{"text":"Tiny little spot in the bottom of a mega condo at the foot of Bay Street. Hard scrable place that is open on Christmas eve (that's when I went). Dedicated to serving Halal, they do a very good beef bacon on their pizza. We ordered an order of lemon pepper wing, which were good but a tad salty. Despite this I would continue to support this spot."}
{"text":"The best part about a night out is the greasy food you get to gorge yourself with afterwards. I was literally lured into this shop by the smell of fresh pizza. Despite some the poor reviews this place has received, the pizza slice I had here was phenomenal.   I wouldn't really go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, maybe consider dropping in for a slice. How good it tastes may or may not be correlated with how late it is in the day."}
{"text":"Anytime i can get food this tasty for these prices I'm usually suspicious, but I've been eating here since the RE-OPENING (with new owners-1 yr) . I love the calzones and specials that they post on facebook everday.  https://www.facebook.com/Mr.PizzaMesa You can't eat a phoo, so don't take my word for it. pop on in and treat yourself to some pie!!"}
{"text":"Location is very convenienent for me, and the extended hours on weekends is something I look forward to. I was not a huge fan of their pizza crust as it was a bit too think in my opinion. The sauce was decent although it could have used more. They were generous with their toppings which helped to balance out the issues I had with the crust and sauce. Their specials aren't as good as other pizza locations (chains) so the price per pizza is a little higher. I would go again for the conveince and topping portions."}
{"text":"We waited more than 30 minutes for our pizza when we came to order for pick up. They were giving priority to their deliveries. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great first impression.  Nice and pizza.  Their hands tossed pizza is not doughy.  Just right with a smooth sauce.  I would like to see them serve slices for those in a hurry and the local school kids.  Friendly owners and staff.  Great family owned pizza shop.  Can't wait to try other stuff.  They seem really creative so they have much more than just pizza."}
{"text":"The first time I had Mr. Pizza I was not a fan.  I went out on a limb to have it again as there are not many late night options in the area. I must say my first experience was nothing compared to my second.  The pizza was much better. I like the greek pizza the most. They definitely have some nice vegetarian options and I am not vegetarian btw but I would order veg just because its so good. The pizza tastes very homeade and that is what I like about it."}
{"text":"I pass this place almost weekly when I go to the Safeway and decided to try it. The pizza is pretty good and it was delivered very quickly, which is nice considering most places take at least 45 minutes to an hour.  What wasn't so good...the wings! These things are disgusting and I didn't even finish one of them. So out of an order of 10, 9.5 were thrown away! I'm not sure what they're doing to them but the texture alone makes them inedible. Add that to the flavor of the chicken and the sauce and the wings are a disaster.   The pizza is very good so I will likely order that again. But I won't waste my money on the wings a second time."}
{"text":"Mr. Pizza has become my \"go-to\" for ordering in.   Although some items such as the garlic bread are a little bland, overall their pizzas are quite good and pricing is much better than most of the \"big-name\" options in the city (I'm looking at you, Pizza Hut). Absolutely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The pizza was edible, but not really worth $4.35 for a slice. The cashier made a mistake with my order (he prepared 2 slices when I only ordered 1) then didn't even bother to apologize when I pointed out the mistake.   Basically, the pizza mediocre at best and the staff needs to learn to pay a bit more attention.  Likely wouldn't come here again unless I have a major pizza craving."}
{"text":"Pros: The pizza was pretty good. The sauce had a bit of warmth in it which I liked. Generous toppings.  Price was pretty good.   Neutral Breaksticks ... yaaaaa ...   Cons: I don't know how the wings were so bad \"in my oppinion\". These are not your traditional wings. As I had a bite, it felt like I was biting into a ball of fat \"or it was super breaded, don't know\". My brother couldn't even finish one of them.  Also, the menu does not match what's on yelp which really annoyed us using the yelp deal. Like when we called and went in, advertisements were different, menue items/sizzes were differnt. It just wasn't a smooth experience."}
