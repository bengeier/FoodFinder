{"text":"I've toured all the clubs in town and Blackhawk is by far my top choice.  I've enjoyed dining on their new patio after playing the fantastic well kept course.  What a great end to many days for my family and I to watch the sunset over the lake.  The Friday night fresh fish special never disappoints.  I've also enjoyed the service in the golf shop and tips from their pro."}
{"text":"If you get a chance to attend an event here, go!  Bar and dining is like stepping back in time in a good way. Food is delish. Atmosphere is comfortable. I'd have stayed longer!"}
{"text":"Their wine dinners are FABULOUS!!!! And the views are stunning.  Love the patio for drinks or dining."}
