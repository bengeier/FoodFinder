{"text":"I ordered a bento box for lunch and I quite enjoyed it. The miso soup was piping hot, the tempura was fresh and the sushi was delicious. Service was great, too. There are signs that state sushi is 50% off Sunday- Wednesday, would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Walked in there with my daughter at 8:30 pm sat down for about 10 minutes ordering... To my surprise the little waitress walks up to me to tell me that the place was closed !!! Closed? The place was wide upend and based on the signed out side and only they say they close at 9 pm... It was so embarrassing in front of other people eating there...food is good not amazing and this is the second time I thought I will give this place a second chance since the last time I was there the same waitress forgot my order plus messed up my order and food took forever...."}
{"text":"OK food, but be prepared to wait an extremely long time for your food. We went later at night and while the restaurant wasn't very busy at all, our sushi took forever to get to us. Small setting, so make sure you have reservations to guarantee a seat.

We waited so long, we had to get some of our food to take home, and even that was a terrible wait. To top it all off the order was wrong. 

Won't be coming back, the owners look more interested in drinking at a table than they do pleasing customers."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  Small little place. 
They should turn up the music just a little more as it is awkwardly quiet.  But all in all very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We ate in and ordered 4 rolls and edamame as an appetizer. We didn't have to wait long and the food was all delicious and the portion sizes were great! Will definitely be ordering take out from them when we have sushi cravings in the future."}
{"text":"Called in for delivery; delivery was fast, customer service was great however the food was terrible."}
