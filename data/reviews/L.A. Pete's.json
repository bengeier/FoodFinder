{"text":"Yet another breakfast adventure in Cleveland, or rather near Cleveland in the suburb of Independence. This place is open daily until 2p, and that sounds like the kind of place that should know how to do breakfast right.

Instead, I'd say they know how to do breakfast well enough. We arrived at about 10:30a on a Saturday, and had no trouble getting a table, as they have plenty of room. Our waitress was quick to get us coffee and for the duration of the meal she was reasonably attentive.

The coffee is nothing impressive; its the \"dishwater\" that Europeans complain about in the U.S., but it kept flowing.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have Splenda, but in a pinch the blue stuff will suffice.

I ordered two eggs with cheese, and home fries. And I also got a shortstack of buttermilk pancakes.

My partner got the \"Interstate,\" which is sausage gravy with biscuits,  eggs, and potatoes.  He got a short stack of French toast on the side.

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our food, and in the mean time, one of the bus boys came by and cleared off our ketchup and Tabasco sauce for some reason.

When the food arrived, it was really underwhelming. My eggs were supposed to be scrambled, but they came out over easy.  They were delivered by someone other than our waitress, and  I didn't want to send them back and wait longer, so I ate them as they were.  I also found that the home fries were really bland and under-prepared. The potatoes and onions were not cooked enough, and they were completely lacking that caramelized crust that makes them worth eating. Instead they were more like a mash of steamed, undersalted  diced potatoes with onions.  My shortstack was also disappointing, because they arrived barely warm. The butter wouldn't even melt on them.

My partner's meal was more satisfying to him than mine was to me, but he also said it was nothing special. Also, the time came when we needed our ketchup and Tabasco back, and it took us at least 10 minuted to get a hold of anyone. His French toast wasn't bad, but it's nothing I couldn't have made at home at the age of 10.

We chalked this one up to experience, and will most likely not return unless we were forced to go by some culinary martyr who loves the place."}
{"text":"Friendly service,  but the food is mediocre  at best.  Ordered  cream of broccoli  soup and it was pretty much all cream with a hint of broccoli.  The side salad was relatively  tasteless  iceburg lettuce.  Again not horrible,  but not great.  Lots of better options nearby."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, DO NOT EAT HERE!! This place is a dump, but I figured they must have such great food that people keep coming back regardless of what it looks like inside.  Not only was the food disgusting, but I also got food poisoning from eating there.  Within an hour of leaving I started getting headaches, feeling cramped up, vomiting and enjoying frequent bouts of diarrhea.  Thanks LA Pete, I will never come back ever again.  The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I can't give it zero"}
{"text":"Service is always good here, they're very accommodating. I got the Garfield heights and it was amazing. Pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, cheese and potatoes."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time here. I liked the location, parking lot, and set up. The food was decent for lunch and I like that there are daily lunch specials and soups. Also with a sandwich you have a choice of potatoes salad, toss salad, or fries. 
I order the buffalo chicken wrap. I have had better. There was not enough buffalo sauce so the server gave me extra and the fries were cold. The price is reasonable. I look forward to trying their breakfast. My friend said the turkey Ruben and banana crepes were delicious!"}
{"text":"There is a small part of me that really wants to hold off on writing this review on the chance that I try them again. I sided on editing the review if that day arrives. For now, here is my tale of woe:

Seems this is a family-run location with a very busy usage on Sunday mornings. We waited a few minutes for a table and both the husband and wife owners kept us and other waiting well informed. They were kind, warm, and friendly. Hence the hesitation to review. 

I ordered the Cuyahoga Heights deep dish breakfast. The waitress assured me that the cook would saut√© the veggies. I asked her twice and twice she said they would be cooked. Her level of knowledge dove into the realm of nonexistent when I asked if the orange juice was fresh squeezed or not. She said she didnt really know and that it is poured from a plastic jug. 

when the plate came out after waiting nearly thirty minutes, the veggies were raw, cool, and crisp. When the server was told this she said that the peppers and onions were in fact cooked. They were not and I showed her by snapping a piece of green pepper in front of her. I asked for it to be sent back and that I would not wish for anything else. I mean, who actually will eat food once it is sent back...spit anyone?

About thee minutes later she arrived with another plate. I told her that I did not want it. She put it down anyway and insisted that the veggies were cooked. Once again, they were not. She asked how I knew and after telling her that there was no way the cooks would be able to do so in less than three minutes, the onions were still crunchy as were the peppers. 

When the check came she still kept them meal on the bill. The younger man acting as cashier removed the charge. 

Not sure I will be back, which is too bad because we stay in this area almost monthly. Oh well, Bob Evans next time I suppose."}
{"text":"Not What It Used To Be

I hadn't been to this place in a couple years.   Oh my, has it gone down hill.  We arrived at a little after 7am on a Monday morning and there were two other tables with diners.   An hour later when we left there still no more patrons.   I sense La Pete's has been abandoned -- and for every good reason. 

My friends had plain pancakes.   These two young men with voracious appetites didn't finish their pancakes.   When we were leaving I asked if they were OK, and both said they were dry and didn't come with enough syrup.   Apparently restaurants no longer serve syrup in dispensers.   The pancakes were delivered with two small plastic lidded containers that were far short of what was necessary for the large stack of pancakes.

I had tea ... now was that a joke or what.   The tea, which wasn't identified as to style (it just said \"tea\") was delivered in a broken plastic carafe.   The missing lid had been replaced by a an empty plastic cup stuck in the opening.   Then it went downhill from there.   The tea tasted like coffee.   I am assuming the same broken carafe had been used previously for coffee.   Yuck!   Then it REALLY got bad,   I ordered crepes filled with fresh strawberries.   The strawberries were very good but the crepes were despicable.  They had been apparently been cooked on a griddle that had been used to cook other things.   They had a distinct hamburger taste!!!!!!   

I will be a cold day in hell when I go back to La Pete's again.   In years past, this was a great breakfast restaurant.   Those days appear to have passed.   Judging from the lack of breakfast customers, I am not the only one who feels that way."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! Great breakfast selection. Tastes homemade and just feels comforting. If I wasn't from out of town I'd be a regular here :)"}
{"text":"Noise, okay food, not a return customer.  Cost was low, not terrible, just not for me.  Ymmv."}
{"text":"This place is on the \"Independence Lunch Loop\" for my coworkers and I. We come here when we need some good old fashioned greasy spoon selections in a funky, French Montmartre atmosphere. The interior is really artsy and fun, with a bit of a circus tent flair (beware: there are creepy/ultra funky portraits of clowns). They have amazing breakfast bowls named after the Southern suburbs that usually involve some sort of melted cheese or gravy. 

I always get flashbacks to My Big Fat Greek Wedding while I am there. If you have been there, you will know what I mean.

All cute, available, employed men under the age of 40 who drive nice cars (my personal weakness) need to come here for lunch and make eyes with me.

They serve Dr. Pepper. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was very filling and delicious. Would recommend it for breakfast"}
{"text":"Quickly seated on a busy day. Friendly waitress.  Speedy service. The food was great at a fair price."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, try the crepes.  Clean, comfortable room. Great service. Friendly people. We're coming back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. You can always get a table. There's variety to the menu, french toast, skillets, special pancakes, egg dishes, etc. The food tastes like it was cooked rather than just plopped in a microwave, which I appreciate. 

I like their buckwheat pancakes and \"Mom's Sassy Apples\" are pretty fun. They are like pie filling. 

This is one of our go to breakfast places because there's ample seating and the food prices are just right."}
{"text":"This place is your average diner.  The decor and the music are out of date and the food is inexpensive and traditional, looking and tasting just as you'd expect.  Nothing fancy or unexpected from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't know why their review is so low.. I've gone there many times and always had a great breakfast. The waitresses are very attentive. Make sure you try their bacon."}
{"text":"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH mediocrity.
Me to the manager:  Your meals are alright, but your coffee leaves a decent amount to be desired.
Manager:  No, it's good.
Me:  Oh, yeah, nevermind.
You can do better within 2 miles north, east, south and west... don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I really like the food and the service and the prices are fair.  My only complaint would be that the owner sits idly on his ass chatting with his friends at the front of the dining room and loudly belittles the waitresses (who by the way are busting their butts and doing a fine job) right out in the open in the dining room.  His behavior is very off-putting. What a do-nothing jerk! I'm torn on stars to give so let me just say I'd like to give the place a 4 and the owner a big old ugly zero like him."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Not the most fancy but great service and good food.  I am looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast, I went there twice and their food is really good and I can planing to go there again. But is it not a place that I will take my friends to ..."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations of L.A. Pete's but I need to explain why I chose 3 stars.
We arrived and there were 2 other couples ahead of us waiting to be seated so we anticipated a small wait.
It ended up being a 12 minute wait and they didn't seem all that busy including an entire section that appeared to be open.
Ordered our food and it took about 20 minutes to receive. A little long but by this time, they seemed to be getting busier.
I judge heavy on my drinks being filled and once it reaches half-way, I expect it to be filled again. Our waitress didn't come back to check on us at any time until we were done eating so both of our drinks went completely empty for several minutes.
Furthermore of a frustrating thing, a couple tables away, our waitress was laughing and joking with an older couple who may have been regulars but didn't give us the 1 minute of time we needed.
The food was great but the service definitely needed improvement."}
{"text":"Service was great very friendly, Food is delicious, you get more for your buck here. I went the other day for crepes at another restaurant and costed $50, went to LA Petes with four persons, The bill only came up to $27 and tasted just as good as the other restaurant"}
{"text":"Great price!  Good quality food! Lots of character!  I got to enjoy a wonderful breakfast with my fellow coworkers. You get a lot of food for the price. The waitress was extremely nice. Don't forget to check out their desert cooler."}
{"text":"I used to come here for breakfast with my co-workers during the week, and it didn't matter if we went at 12:30pm or 1:30pm, it was almost always slow service.  Today was an even more awful predicament - at 12:30pm, we were seated, at 12:45pm they took our order, at 1:15pm they brought our food, and the only reason why we got our checks is because I went to the front of the restaurant and mentioned to the hostess about our lack of a waitress.  More and more this place reminds me of a restaurant for Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.  This place is continuing downhill, and I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"This is a tough place for me to review. I will start out by mentioning that when my business colleague and I visited on a weekday morning at 7:15am, the place was deserted. Apparently, we were the first customers of the day. Not generally a good sign.

First off, their coffee was borderline awful. It was drinkable but that's about the only good thing that I can say about it. A breakfast spot should be able to serve up good coffee.

I had French toast which was pretty good - not great. It was a tad darker than I like it (I probably should have asked for it light). Not bad but I've had better. The bacon, on the other hand, was GREAT. Nice and thick and it was served just the way I like it - not overly-limp but not super-crisp. To be quite honest, the bacon and the prompt service saved this place from a 2-star review.

The 1960's music playing was fine but got to be a bit much (personally, if a place is going to be spinning top-40 hits, I'd prefer that they throw in some 70's stuff, too). If you're going to stay stuck in the 60's, at least throw in some Yardbirds, Zombies, or other British Invasion material.

All-in-all, I'd probably stick with Bob Evans which is nearby and serves up good coffee."}
{"text":"Alright, I am going to be real with you. I was really hesitant about going to this place because I thought it was going to be a dump. I was so wrong! 

We went to lunch today to celebrate a co-worker's birthday and they wanted to go here so we went. Outside it looks like nothing special, inside it's a hodgepodge of brown walls/ceiling, a wall of mirrors, party carpet, colorful glass light fixtures (some missing light bulbs), and songs like Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers were playing. Our party of 8 was seated right away at a big table in the middle of the restaurant. The waitress accidentally whacked me in the head with several menus. 

BUT

The staff is nice, the food is good, and the price is great! Seriously, I got the Cuyahoga Heights deep dish skillet for only $6.99! It consisted of sliced potatoes, sausage gravy, sausage, green peppers, onions, two over medium eggs, and rye toast. HUGE portion that left me stuffed all day. And it was TASTY! Our server was prompt with the water refills and checks so there was no long wait on anything. I was very pleasantly surprised by this place!

So lesson learned today: Don't judge a book by its cover or you're gonna miss out on a good story. (I'm blanking on a good food version of this saying)"}
{"text":"I've never written a review before, but this place was so terrible I downloaded yelp so I could warn others. I am no food snob but if I go out to eat I expect it to be a little nicer than my dubious quick meals I make at home. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad was basically brown lettuce from one of those premise sale bags you buy at target with shredded cheese from a bag and a tomato cut in half. The chicken in the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting in a container for a while, there was no buffalo sauce, and the ranch did not taste like ranch. My moms hamburger was likely sitting in the freezer forever. 
The service was also terrible our waitress was late coming to the table, never filled our drinks, and our flood was slow to arrive.

Too long didn't read- DONT GO HERE! GO TO WENDYS INSTEAD FOR BETTER QUALITY FOOD AT A BETTER PRICE!!"}
{"text":"Pete's is a nice breakfast restaurant.  Word is they are now expanding their hours of service to lunch and dinner as well.  The quality is ok.  The service is good and food tastes ok.  Its not a five star tuxedo service by any means but you know what your going to get.  It has a Mom and Pop feel to it.  I really like that."}
{"text":"This place is cute and I truly appreciate a restaurant with their own flare. The atmosphere gives off that old diner feel, with oldies playing and a mix of dated woods and carpet. It seemed like a big attraction for the baby boomer generation from the looks of our table and the ones around us. The food was ok, also classic diner-style flavors and presentation. 

While overall I would classify this experience, food, and restaurant as average, the service was outstanding. Our server was incredibly attentive with coffee refills and food deliveries. That's enough to make me return. Good help is hard to find and it is nice to feel appreciated as a patron."}
{"text":"When this place was called \"Le Peep\" they had the most amazing Eggs Benedict that I've ever had (5 stars without a doubt). Since the wierd name change they went through to \"L.A. Petes\"... (ooookayyyyy)... it seems like things have gone downhill in the food department. The service is still top notch but I find myself going their less and less as the food declines. Time to find new breakfast diggs."}
{"text":"I visited La Pete's for the first time on a Saturday morning. When I entered the restaurant I was greeted by a friendly hostess and a variety of breakfast food aromas. La Pete's is huge and decorated nicely. It did not take long to be seated and we were asked if we had a seating preference. After being seated were promptly greedy by our waitress, who was very sweet. It took us awhile to order mainly because I'm very indecisive and there were a lot of options. I finally decided on a breakfast scrambler, which was very tasty. My dining experience was awesome! I'm looking forward to going back. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Yum, big portions small price tag, worth a sit down even though they have weird hours."}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast at the suggestion of my wife's uncle (who lives in Broadview Heights.) The place looks kinda shady from the outside, but their breakfast food was absolutely top-notch. Large portions, fast & efficient service, quality breakfast meats. Oh, and not to mention they're rather affordable. If I lived in the area, I would totally frequent this place."}
{"text":"The Cuyahoga Heights Breakfast Bowl is TO DIE FOR.  Literally, with all that fried eggs, sausage gravy and melted cheese... I'm surprised that my arteries are still functioning.

It's a risk I'm willing to take over and over again.

Above that, this is a cute little restaurant that specializes in a lot of breakfast food.  Their service is pretty good - I really enjoy coming here for lunch during the work day."}
{"text":"This is the place people go to when they get tired of waiting (and waiting) for Bob Evan's predictable breakfast or picking hairs out of a Denny's yucky breakfast. LA Pete's is the same as Simon's in Brecksville. The food is good but not great, the prices are cheap, the service is dependable and you never have to wait to get some eggs. If it's morning and you're on Rockside for whatever, skip Bob's and go to LA Pete's.

Cavs players/coaches from across the street sometimes stop by so it can't be that unhealthy..."}
{"text":"I've driven past this tons of times but finally decided to stop when traveling towards downtown the other day and it was fantastic! The wait was short even with how busy they were. Our coffee was always refreshed, and the speed and detail of the wait staff was great. Hope to be back soon"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and lunch fare. I hear that this restaurant is owned by the family who owns the Winking Lizard. Alas that the inside of the restaurant looks so old and worn, which is the complete opposite of any of the Lizards.

But the service was really good. Kind and attentive waitress, and all the coffee refills we could want. I like how the breakfast specials have geographically appropriate names. I had the Route 21 traditional breakfast plate, but I was eyeing all of the potato-based deep dish/skillet options, with names like the I480, Newburg Heights, and Brecksville.

$28 for three people to eat breakfast: now that's a good deal, though. It's too bad that they haven't yet invested in the decor enough to make it rival a far cuter (but more expensive) breakfast place like Your's Truly down the hill."}
{"text":"I suppose it would be proper to start with a positive note.   The people/staff are friendly and the service was fast.

Food quality..  if there was a way to give negative stars I would.  I had an omelet with veggies and a side of turkey sausage.  The eggs were rubbery and the sausage links reminded me of cube shaped cardboard.  I swear they microwaved my entire meal. 

Even the coffee was disgusting as if they reused the grinds a second time.  I'm all for recycling and sustainability but NOT for my coffee. 

I've had better meals at Dennys back in the day of 2am after parties.  

My bill was $12...  yes cheap but what's the point if you can't eat the food.   

YUCK!!  never again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local brunch spot.  Great food, cheap huge portions, great service!"}
{"text":"As a non coffee drinker I was almost giddy when I was given 2 waters! The waitress continued to be kind and anticipating of my needs. It was clear there are many regulars here from the friendly conversations. 
I ordered the Spinach Supreme that included fresh mushrooms, bacon and cheese. It was yummy and filling. I wasn't a big fan of the hash browns, but I was too full to eat many because of the size of the omelette. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast while waiting on the NTB next door to replace a couple of tires.  Business was brisk on a Saturday morning but not overly busy.  I was seated right away and received my order in 5 minutes.  My server Krissy was very attentive and congenial. I ordered the I 480 which is two eggs, short stack of pancakes, potatoes and choice of bacon or sausage.  The portions were very healthy and the pancakes were fantastic, but the rest of the meal was very average.  In retrospect I should have opted for bacon instead of sausage.  I did ask for salsa on the side and was accommodated.

All in all it was a positive experience.  This is definitely a place that caters to the older breakfast crowd (Sirius XM 60s on 6 plays in the background) but perfect for a sub-$10 meal."}
{"text":"This is L.A. Pete's contrary to the Yelp spelling of \"La Pete's\". So it is not some kind of French name. The breakfast is good, cheap and a nice independently owned place to go for lunch in Independence. I don't know why people eat at the chains like Denny's or Bob Evans down the road. The chains do exactly what their name implies and hold people captive to corporate slavery. Support a locally owned business and come to L.A. Pete's. If you decide to dine at Denny's, you may as well sing the lyrics to Country Feedback by REM. \"It's crazy what you could've had\" at L.A. Pete's instead. The view of the cemetery across the road is nice. The trees are beautiful in the fall. The barren landscape of the graveyard with criss-crossing branches is evocative in the winter. It is nice to eat some warm food while alive and above ground."}
{"text":"The prices are ok, the food is typical cheap diner food.  This is the type of place that tries to attract the local retirees and elderly.  Nice location, but everything seems worn out.  

I have eaten here twice.  The breakfast is ok, about what you would expect at a chain.   My lunch salad was subpar.  There was a big chunk of the lettuce core and stem mixed in.  The menus were stained and beat up.  I want to like this place, but even the service was poor, and they were not busy."}
