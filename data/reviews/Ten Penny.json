{"text":"Best food I've ever eaten!  Would recommend this place to everyone!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in Pittsburgh. My night began with a staff of unpleasant employees. Most of whom were standing around doing nothing but chatting amongst themselves with hideous scowls on their faces. Get a clue people, you're not that cool, you're at work, that's probably what you should be doing. The demeanor of the hostess is what really gave me a horrible taste in my mouth upon entering but, the server. Oh The server, Heather (I only know her name from the receipt because she did not introduce herself) needs to find a profession that doesn't involve people skills; she lacks them completely. She totally rushed us, interrupted the tables conversation to force an order out of us with an entirely empty restaurant, then totally.disappeared for about 45 minutes while some other girl sort of/kind of checked on the table. We informed someone who had some semblance of being a GM of how unhappy we were, but since the whole staff seemed to lack any sort of social grace, he clearly did nothing. It took them three rounds of disgusting cold coffee to even take it off the bill. Cute decor, mediocre at best food, and staff that should be ashamed of themselves. Huge THUMBS DOWN."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and wait for about 10 minutes before a bus boy brought us water. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, and 15 minutes after that we still hadn't received our beverages. Finally we left after being seated for more than a half hour without having received anything at all. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great experience! I walked in around 1 PM & was quickly seated. My first impression of the restaurant was how warm I felt inside. Almost gave a home-y feel. The inside was decked out in Christmas decor & had lots of room in order to move. Very warm inviting environment! I ordered the grilled cheese (w/ tamatos) tamato soup. I only have a few complaints: grilled cheese came to me a little cooler than I would like it, the tomatos on my sandwich were very small & obviously unfresh. Overall the meal was good, just not great.   Would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!!  Ten Penny came highly recommended by a non-local.  Ordered the Ten P Burger and was too hungry and impressed for a picture.  I ate at Primanti Bros. earlier this week and would HIGHLY suggest coming here instead.  The burger was cooked perfectly, I asked for medium, and the fried egg on top was perfect.  Everyone in our group was pleased and would definitely recommend it to anyone who visits."}
{"text":"Was here a year ago and much better experience then. Now, they need to improve the kitchen. Lamb osso buco was barely room temperature, the sauce was overcooked, avocado on crab salad was not ripe and barely edible, tomato bisque sub par. Service was good however. Will not return."}
{"text":"Went to Ten Pen for Fri late lunch. Hesitant to try a new place w such mixed reviews, but glad we did.  Sat at the bar, drinks were great and had really good service from one-L Michele! Had the cheese plate, meatballs and mar pizza.  Everything was good and after talking w MicheLe, certain to go for brunch soon. Hopefully she will wait on us again.  She was super nice and if she is their face of service, I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! We had the Duck Confit and Waffles and will definitly be back for it soon!"}
{"text":"Let's see, atmosphere was nice, we were in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Service was pretty good until we witnessed the table two down from ours observe a huge roach crawling across the floor of the restaurant.  The server saw it and jumped and screamed and ran up the steps.  One of the guy servers came over and chased the bug and smashed it with his foot. We could hear it crunch.  It was horrible.  As we were leaving I saw one of the people from the roach table in the ladies room.  I asked her if they comped or reduced their bill for such a terrible experience and she said they did nothing.  Not even a visit from management.   YIKES!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and never had a good experience.  The place has a really cool atmosphere and I want to like it but the service has been horrible every time I have been here.  The servers are rude and slow.  I have never tried the food because the service for just drinks was so bad.  This time I was joking with my friend about a seat being saved and the bar tender said I was cut off.  I was/am not drunk.  I wasn't swearing, being loud, stumbling, etc.  In fact, I am sitting at the bar drinking water as I write this.  It is a busy night and it is crowded so I understand them being on alert for people out of control but their judgement is obviously lacking.  This is my last time coming here."}
{"text":"Bad experience: We went to Ten Penny tonight for a nice dinner. It was about 9:30 and it wasn't too busy. The hostess was very accommodating and cleared a booth for us to sit. However, not a single server, including the manager, stopped to greet us or even ask if we wanted a water.  What made matters worse was that the manager walked by us 3 times and never stopped. On the 4th, I think he realized that no one had been over and continued walking on to find a server. After more than 10 minutes without as much as a greeting, we decided to leave. Poor service and poor management skills. I've been in the restaurant industry for a long time and there's no reason why the manager can't step up and greet the table. Set an example for your servers and staff who are busy...let them know that you, as the manager, have their back if they are busy. Do not walk by the table (who does not even have a water) multiple times and keep walking as if you're above that. It is a shame because my girlfriend and I love that place, but are now not interested in going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for friends and family's.. The mix drinks can not be beat, one of the best places in pittsburgh I have tried! Food is great, the service is wonderful!! Love the atmosphere.. It real cool.. It looks old but new! Only way to see is try it for yourself!! I'll be back many times over! Love it here every time! The staff and management is so friendly and helpful. Michelle is wonderful  along with Megan. Always happy to see us and check on us!  Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Won't be back any time soon.  Although the atmosphere was very nice the food and service didn't quite match! Appetizers (mussels, brussel sprouts, calamari, tuna wontons) were tasty...should have probably stopped there...they ran out of ravioli which 4 in our party ordered.  Chicken was inconsistent across 3 duplicate orders?  I made mention of a birthday celebration with my reservation but nothing special was done?  We requested our party of 9 have separate checks at the beginning and were told they would accommodate...then staff switched mid service and eye rolled when we reminded them of our request.  Ultimately they put a smile on and complied but could have been handled better.  Anyway food was a mixed bag some enjoyed their meals, others did not.   Thankfully we all still enjoyed our time together but next time someone else might need to pick the spot.   ps. The pretzel rolls were amazing...thumbs up"}
{"text":"food is really good.  based on food and drinks I would give 5 stars.  they loose 2 stars for service.   my 24 hrs in Pittsburgh I have yet to experinace good restaurant service and Ten penny joins to club. sorry folks. great food burt need to work on your processes. I had a salad but no fork for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'll give you the facts as it happened :)  So I walked in to Ten Penny for lunch after getting out of jury duty (yay!).  I looked for the host and no one was to be found so I settled and made my way to the bar.  As I sat down, I noticed the host at his stand TEXTING!!  Ugh :( I didn't really want to sit at the bar, so I approached him and asked if I could have a table for one.  In the rudest, most condescending tone, he said, \"I'm sorry, but we're booked.\"  Really?!? At 1:30 with the place practically empty?  OK, I went with the flow and sat at the bar.  I ordered a water to start and told the bartender, \"I already know what I'd like, the salad nicoise, please.\"  He said, \"I'm sorry, that is no longer on our menu.\"  I politely said, \"It was on your menu on your website.\"  (Mind you, at this point, I'm about ready to eat my own arm.  I honestly think my stomach was eating itself I was that hungry.)  He said, \"No, we had to 'dumb down' our menu because it was too much for the kitchen to handle.\"  I told him, \"You guys need to update your website then.\"    Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed, not in the fact they didn't have what I wanted to eat, but in the fact of the poor attention to service they exemplified.  Honestly, log into Pinterest and search for their menu items.  You too could make what's on their menu at a fraction of the price (check out DJ's Butcher in Bloomfield for awesome meats).  On the way out, I reminded the host to pay attention at work.  I understand they're \"new\", but basic Service 101 goes a very long way, especially in the restaurant industry and with so many new places opening up.  This all happened on March 18th and as of today, April 14th, the salad Nicoise is still on their online menu.  Too bad-I really wanted to like this place :("}
{"text":"Really nice, open atmosphere. The decor is cozy and rustic, along with open walls. The food was pretty good, but the wait was ridiculous. We waited for about an hour, and 4/6 of us ordered burgers. The service is decent, although a little slow. Overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant. I went last night for the first time, and was truly impressed with the atmosphere, service and food.  I decided to be one of \"those people\" and asked our server if I could sub scallops for the shrimp choice on my Pasta Primavera, and she was so accommodating, she asked the chef, and he said it was totally fine. (Now, if you want to try this option yourself, the dish is the same price as the regular scallops dish-- this did not bother me at all because if they hadn't been able to do it I was just going to order the scallops entree anyhow, so don't yap about the up charge and give the staff a hard time about it!)  We sat at one of the tables, but I am dying to come back with a reservation for one of the booths. They look like big comfy couches!   I wish I could definitely remember our server's name-- I think it was Laura. Owners of Ten Penny: if you read this, she was wonderful! Nice, attentive, but didn't hover!   My boyfriend ordered the New York Strip and loved it. He shared a piece with me, and I definitely agreed with him."}
{"text":"This is a 2 part review that focuses mostly on service; as I have not dined there, but have on several occasions had business groups stop in for drinks.  The decor is cool, and due to its proximity to the office, convenient.   Beer list is decent. Not a wine connoisseur, but seems fine. Scotch collection is adequate.  Service has been TERRIBLE on 2 occasions.  1. Had a large corporate group at the bar. Waitress serving tables at the bar was extremely annoyed and outright rude to us as it was implied that we were in her way repeatedly. Poor bar design is not the customers fault. The area is narrow and not suited to have easy access by servers. Also, the rest of the more accessible tables in the restaurant were empty, as it was barely 5:30. Manager came over to ask us to move later, and was also extremely rude and could use a lesson in customer service. A simple, \"Here group of 10 enjoying drinks at our bar, we want to make room for you over here\", would have done nicely.  2. A week later, another group of mine go to enjoy appetizers and drinks before dinner. We order the Paul Hobs 2007 Pinot Noir, they arrive and open a 2012. Upon realizing the error, we politely ask why the wrong wine was given, and also ask to just have the price of the 2012 vintage reflected on the bill. 1st response was, \"the bar manager said they are the same price\". When we ask to see the manager, we are promptly ignored on the issue for the rest of our visit.  Suffice to say, inadequate service for a place which had great potential. Keep it up and you'll be closed before you can pay for the fancy decor and renovations."}
{"text":"I was here last week for dinner with some friends. We had a reservation since there were 7 of us. We sat down, waitress was right over to get drink orders & answer menu questions.  The troubles started when we asked for separate checks, they said for 6 or more they didn't separate them, but that we could put 7 credit cards on one bill & split it. Don't get me started on how this is less efficient than separate checks.  My friend ordered the meatball appetizer as part of her main meal. She received her salad first, but we were told it would be about 10 more minutes for the meatball because it was still cooking. When it finally came out it was mushy & what felt raw on the inside, she politely asked to send it back & get something else in its place. Waitress said \"No problem\". A few minutes later the manager came over, to tell us that it wasn't raw, they cook in a pot for 8 hours & that she shouldn't have sent it back. Get your story straight here people, does it cook for 8 hours, or were you cooking it & it needed 10 more minutes. The manager was rude & unprofessional to a situation that was initially handled well.  I received my caesar salad, which to the tune of $9 is no more than 2 hearts of romaine with some caesar dressing drizzled over top. Seems expensive if I have to cut all my own lettuce, but okay.  Finally our bill came. The meatball remained on the bill + the substitute item ordered, my drink was more than the listed menu price & we had a 20% gratuity added (which the menu stated was only for parties of 8 or more - we were a party of 7.) I brought the receipt errors to the attention of the waitress. Who returned & had fixed one problem. I showed her again the wrong drink price + 20% gratuity. She huffed & told me the drink was $8. I said, none of your menus say that, and I showed her. She finally told me she would \"see what she could do\" before returning with a receipt with correct drink price, but still 20% gratuity. I was told that because the initial reservation was for 8 that we were subject to the 20% gratuity. Unfortunately, we were running behind at this point for our other evening plans & my friends told me not to worry about it.  There's a reason this place was not packed on a Saturday night, the food is of average or lesser quality for expensive prices, the service is slow, and the customer is apparently NOT always right."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and had an awful experience. Food was awful. Took forever to get. The steak was pounded out and flattened before cooked. Steak was dry. Server was new and trying but not very attentive. Bar drinks were way to strong. Sides were not shareable. Host was not friendly. The one waiter was yelling at another waiter over our table. It was a horrific experience and it made us late to our show."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very cool. It's beautiful. The service was great and the brussel sprouts are a must-have! I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you are going to the Convention Center for any event. It's a nice short walk."}
{"text":"I had reservations at 2, when I arrived I was told I could not sit in the dinning room.  So we sat at the bar.  Later we were apologized to for the confusion.  Several items came out of the kitchen with no known table.  Service was spotty at best, I have a feeling these folks were pulled from their other locations to work here though.  There were large gaps of time before we would see the server.  Probably would have ordered more drinks if better attention had been paid.  Atmosphere was good.  The industrial/reclaimed look works well for the Pittsburgh area.    I am willing to give them another try in a few months, once they have kinks figured out and a dedicated staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here Saturday night prior to attending the symphony. We ordered the the Calamari as an appetizer. Presentation was very nice, flavor was good but would have been better if it had been served hot not lukewarm. Next my husband tried the Gumbo...no complaints here! I ordered a steak may husband ordered the pork chop. His chop came with smoked Gouda polenta which was served COLD! A female manger was walking around and checking on tables. When she stopped at our table we told her about our displeasure with the temperature that our food was served. She replaced the polenta and took the calamari off of our check. We paid our bill and was getting ready to leave when a waiter carrying some other guests dinner smacked me in the forehead with the plate of food. Even though it was an accident he it me hard enough that I saw stars and immediately got dizzy. The table beside us kept saying we need a manager over here now! After a few minutes, I went to the restroom to check on my forehead. The general manager, Craig Lydon, was speaking with my husband when I returned. We agreed this was an accident, However, he never asked for my information to follow up with me. He did ask us several times what we wanted him to do. Our thoughts were...you are the general manager you should know what you should do! He told us he was sorry and gave us a $25 gift card to pay for part of our meal when we come back.  Accidents happen but he should have comped our meal and given us at least a $75 gift card to come back. By the way, my forehead is still tender two days later!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beginning, a middle, and and end.   Beginning: hostess could care less that we came there to eat. The waitress was nice, and we only had to wait about 5-10 mins for her to get us water.   Middle: we ordered a salad to start, which took 30 minutes to get to the table. Our entree took an hour, and during that hour we only saw our waitress once. However, there was a man in a suit with a clownish smile walking about the restaurant like a mouse in a maze holding his arm at a ninety degree angle as if there were a napkin hanging from it ready to sweep up some table crumbs. We assumed he was the manager, but we couldn't be sure because he didn't approach a table the entire time we were there.   End: the food was mediocre and over priced. We left with hungry bellies and light wallets.   The atmosphere was really cool, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ten Penny has great food, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. After what happened yesterday, I will not be back.   It's near my office, so we have gone a few times to celebrate special events. They always get one person's order wrong. As a former waiter, I understand how hard it is to serve a large party, but every time? The real reason I'm not going back is because they overcharged us. One co-worker and I ordered their (delicious) grilled cheese and tomato soup and asked for a side salad. The menu says \"Choice of Side +3). They charged us $8 each for our salad. Since one person usually pays for the group and we divide later, we didn't find out until the next day. A call to the restaurant didn't give us the benefit of the doubt, so they'll get my extra five bucks, but never again my business."}
{"text":"The staff were so rude! We walk in at 10:30pm on a Thursday night (they were open until 1am). We just wanted drinks and maybe a couple appetizers. The hostess points to the bar and says we can only sit there. There were no seats together (there were 4 of us) so I asked if we could sit at the table near the bar and a waiter said yes. After 10 minutes of dirty glares from the bartenders, one finally comes over and asks what we wanted. He purposely took at least 10 minutes to get our mixed drinks. Ridiculous. And the appetizers were gross too. Save your money and go next door to Tonic!"}
{"text":"Had lunch & dinner here on 2 seperate days. Food and staff were awesome. For lunch I had a buger, cooked to perfection and juicy. For dinner we shared a crab cake appetizer with citrus salsa. It was awesome! I had the shrimp & scallop risotto with was very good. My wife had the Margarita flat bread. Now she is an expert in Margarita pizza, and she said that this is the best that she ever had. Andrea was our waitress and was an awesome host."}
{"text":"I tried out Ten Penny earlier for Brunch. I was very disappointed. I ordered the cheese plate for $14 which included one piece of Biscotti about 4 cranberries and 5 walnuts with a variety of 3 cheeses. I was sharing this with 2 other people , how you are suppose to share one piece of biscotti with 2 other people? I asked for crackers or something additional  to eat the cheese with and later recieved a bread basket. Extremely disappointing especially with such a simple appetizer.  I then ordered  the Jack'd up Cuban with the cole slaw ,Jack cheese, and carmerlized onions. I had to send this back after a few bites because there was absolutely no taste to the pork or cole slaw not to mention no onions on it. The best part of my visit was my drink and the atmosphere .Unfortunately won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good service.  The Brussels were good but a little over seasoned for my tastes. The truffle fries tasted good but they used premade French fries which gave them a cheap look and feel.  I would recommend that they switch to hand cut fries.  The entrees were filling, presented well, and tasted very good.  I had a Moscow Mule and was allowed to keep the copper mug which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Get the scallops with Risotto. Phenomenal. A good choice is you're opposite the Westin. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation here for 18 people. We had a server who still has 4 other tables. It took 40 mins to get our drinks than an hour for her to even take our food order. That comes back to management for being under staffed. But when the food came out my steak i had ordered medium rare was well done. So tough. I had to send it back. It comes back being rare. I mean so rare that it's cold and bleeding. Sent back yet again. At this point I'm not even hungry. The food is so expensive for TERRIBLE quality. The atmosphere of this place is beautiful I had high hopes. Maybe just stop for drinks. But hey you could wait 45 minutes even just for those."}
{"text":"Nice place. Pretty good food. Friendly staff. plenty of seating at the bar or in the dining room. There were eight of us that just sat at the bar and we all had various items for dinner. I heard no complaints what so ever. The outer wall all open to the outside, so there is kind of an in-door/out-door feel to the place. Decent drink selection too!"}
{"text":"Went to Ten Penny before a Sunday night show at the Benedum recently.  A few things to note.  For a restaurant in the Cultural District, the waitress did not ask if we had tickets and a time limit.  Other places around the theaters will ask on the weekends, but not here.  I wasn't in the mood for meat, so I ordered the pasta primavera; husband ordered the TP Burger.  We were both very underwhelmed.  The contents on my plate looked like it could've come from a cafeteria.  No frills, just a white plate with some penne haphazardly thrown on.  The \"primavera\" part of the dish consisted of a few strings of finely shredded carrot and zucchini - it was basically garnish.  There were no chunks of ripe veggies to be had.  Not even a slice of bread on the side.  There was a flavor note in the red pepper sauce that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was the worst red pepper sauce I've ever had.  My husband's burger had an egg on top that was runny and very messy.  He ordered the burger medium and it arrived well done.  So well done it was a hockey puck.  The price of my primavera dish was absolute highway robbery.  A dish that likely cost them a buck to make is going for $18 - for goodness sake they couldn't even be bothered to give the customer an entire carrot!   The overdone, messy burger was $14.  These prices are in line with what other surrounding restaurants charge, but the difference is those restaurants make food that tastes good.  We had hoped for much better from Ten Penny because the reviews were fine, but I'm noticing now that a lot of people are reviewing when they admit to never trying the food.  I cannot understand these reviews unless they're having friends and family write them.  I guess the lesson here is don't' go to Ten Penny if you want to eat."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome! So you can't blame him. Plus it was New Years. But it was actually not that busy.   We started with drinks which quickly arrived.   Our group of 8 had a reservation so we did not have to wait for a table. Props to Kari for her planning.   Started with some apps which arrived perfectly on time. The best part of the meal were the stars of the night. Second was the meatball.   The truffle Mac and cheese was good. The wife really liked it but I thought it was a little to cheesy!   Wife had the brisket and I ordered the filet.   2 other people had the brisket which ended up being a problem. The server came back and told us that the \"owner just walked in and took the last briskets\" all this after we already ordered. I've never heard of that and personally was offended by the selfishness of the owner.   Worst excuse ever and I would have rather been lied too.   Timing was good and they had plenty of runners. And the meals came out timed well but ready further of why that became the flaw.   I ordered med rare filet but it came out well done. At $38 bucs had to return it as it was so dry. Literally two mins later, their 2nd attempt arrived. Burnt, and over cooked again but better than the first time.   I forced myself to eat it but the wine helped it go down easier.   You could tell everything was pre cooked. My mashed potatoes tasted great but you could tell they pre plated them and they had a hard crust on them just like at a wedding.   On to the wife's short ribs. Literally she could not cut them. After one bite she gave up. Short ribs are supposed to be tender and fall apart. These were so over cooked it was terrible.   The rest of our party also had problems. Cold meatballs, disgusting and dry fish, salty Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes and pineapple was just wrong, pork tenderloin was more like pork jerky.   The waiter took the fish off the bill but I choose not to speak up. But he should have asked about the other non eaten meals. We just didn't want to complain.   Sorry but never again."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. The fries are also very good. Only downside was no coke products...booooo!"}
{"text":"It's a shame to waste such an awesome atmosphere and location.  The service was rough, starting at the hostess stand.  I get it.  You're important because you're wearing ironic, black, thick-framed glasses and we can't get a menu unless your will be done.  How about a slight smile and a \"Happy Anniversary,\" I know you can read the reservation screen.  The wait staff was flying around, but not accomplishing much of anything.  My glass sat empty longer than it contained a tasty brew.  The food seemed prepackaged, I imagined the calamari being dumped out of a large plastic bag and into the deep fryer.  The Lamb Shank came out fast... too fast... as if it was waiting, let's say, under a heat lamp.  The Brussel Sprouts were OK, but there are much better in Pittsburgh.  Bright side was the beer list, they did have some great beers and plenty of seasonals available.  Maybe someday the food and service will catch up to the atmosphere and, more importantly, the bill."}
{"text":"My experience with Ten Penny was really disappointing.  Besides the relaxing decor, this place needs a lot of work.      We started with the Mega Meatball, which had decent marinara and ricotta.  I got the porcini ravioli with mascarpone, which wasn't ravioli at all.  Instead, it was giant sheets of pasta dough folded over.  Each of the four \"raviolis\" was about six inches wide.  The mascarpone itself was way too tangy and rich (it didn't seem to have anything added to it).  The sundried tomatoes were really hard and they didn't add to the dish.  It was lazy.  My husband got the flounder, which might have been the worse presentation I have ever seen.  It looked like something that you would get from a diner for $8. The side of mashed potatoes was under-seasoned and unimpressive.  The \"creme brulee\" had no hard shell on top and it tasted like frozen cheesecake.  Drinks were okay--too expensive (9.50 for a gin and tonic, and no questions from the server about what gin was preferred).  Costs here are astronomical for the quality of food that you are getting.  In the end, we spent about $150 for an appetizer, drinks, entrees with one side, and dessert.  That wouldn't be bad if they put care into their food, but they don't. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"very slow service, overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered a grilled caesar salad and was given 2 soggy pieces of lettuce with the most dressing i've ever seen in my life. Not a great experience, especially considering the high price tag."}
{"text":"very much a tavern with a very industrious feel.  If in the area good tavern but i did not feel like it was a destination place for dinner."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here with two of my friends.  Our drinks took a while and when we got them, the ingredients in one cocktail were substituted without asking.  Service was slow and aloof.  The men's restroom did not have any paper towels.  I alerted the staff and after approximately 30 minutes...still no paper towels.  At the end of the meal, the price was wrong for one item.  The burger that was ordered was solid and the mussels were tasty with big chunks of sausage.  Rissotto was   Overall, I'm going to give this place two stars because it's got a lot of room for improvement.  Not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Nice interior--rugged, very Pittsburgh. Steel City fo sho. Hockey on the tube, bonus points.  The selection of drafts--nice. I opted for a local artisan cider--very good, very pricey. Worth it.  The food--good. Very good. The Shrimp Trio appetizer was quality, tasty. Had a Mediterranean flatbread, which was overly salty and passable, but not something I'd order again. The tomato bisque, OK. Get something else.  The glazed salmon was excellent. Nice presentation and the accompanying flavors were well balanced.   Overall, the place is priced well and makes the effort to prepare exceptional food, even if they miss here and there. Definitely a place I'd return to if it were convenient."}
{"text":"Two of us ate brunch here last Sunday. Our waiter was really nice and the bloody Mary's were nicely made. The food was another matter. My friend had the omelette and said it was good but I think she was just being nice. I had the breakfast skillet with Apple chicken sausage. This dish consisted of a cute little cast iron skillet containing cubed \"breakfast\" potatoes which were completely unseasoned, two half dollar sized sausage patties standing on end (prompting my friend to ask what they were) and an overlooked \"dippy\" egg-&9. While the skillet itself was quite hot, the food was lukewarm and very dry.  My friend asked for an order of toast; she got one slice as did I so I'm not sure if toast was included with mine. Butter and jam were on my friend's plate but I got neither. The coffee was good."}
{"text":"We came in with a large group. We made reservations but had no table ready. They pushed several together in the bar area. When ordering we were told there were $7 wines. When it came to pay it wasn't $7 but $18 a glass! We were then told it was \"house wines\" but one in the party ordered \"chardonnay\" and was still charged for the higher price.   The food was good which rated the two - otherwise this would be a one. Watch your drink order."}
{"text":"I was holding off on my review because I thought initially the kitchen was perhaps having a bad day but the food has been just average two visits in a row.  While the food was by no means terrible it wasn't phenomenal either.  I had the stuffed flounder on both visits.  Again, the flounder was not awful but it wasn't amazing either.  The accompanying side dishes, quinoa and baby bok choy were completely bland and unseasoned.  Perhaps the chef was trying not to overwhelm the delicate mildness of the fish - who knows.  This brings me to my next point, however:  my dinner partner (who is a seasoned fisherman) swore up and down that my flounder was tilapia.  Don't get me wrong when I say I ate all of it on both of my two visits because it wasn't horrible.  Just rather average, uneventful flavors.  I found it strange, however, that the menu advertised it as flounder when it was, in fact, something else.  The highlight of the meal was our appetizer, crispy brussel sprouts.  They were fried and tossed with jack daniels, blue cheese and bacon!  Over the top delicious.  For our second visit we had the chocolate mousse which was average at best.  Sort of rudimentary flavor, texture and presentation.  We certainly finished it but it didn't blow me out of the water either.  Just Applebee's or Olive Garden quality at best.  I will say our drinks took forever as well.  We could plainly see our server waiting at what appeared to be a pick up area for cocktails and also observed the bartender taking her time as if she had not a care in the world.  The drinks taking ten minutes would be understandable if the restaurant was busting at the seams and busy but this was not at all the case.  If anything there were quite a few open tables and maybe less than 12 people at the bar.  A glass of wine and a beer shouldn't take that long. One of the two positive things about Ten Penny is their extensive selection of microbrews on draft and their HUGE wine list.  While I haven't lived in Pittsburgh my whole life I have yet to find a spot with such an impressive array of wines by the bottle/glass and a constantly changing draft selection.  If nothing else I would come back just for the wine and beer selection.  The second positive highlight was our server:  her wine recommendations and beer descriptions were incredibly accurate.  It was a wonderful surprise and probably the highlight of our meal to have a server who was professional, polite, didn't hover too much but was more than able to answer our questions about the food and offer progressive, trendy pairing ideas for our meal.  Next time I'll return, look for the nice woman (I think it was Rosa or Raye?) who waited on us and just get a bottle of wine.  As per the food, the chef really needs to step it up especially with so many other incredible restaurants in the downtown area offering food that is far more delicious for the same prices as Ten Penny."}
{"text":"Great decor but grossly overpriced for mediocre food. Our waiter did not help the experience and seemed to be distracted. Go for drinks to experience the bar but leave the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Ten Penny a handful of times.  The atmosphere is great for a happy hour and there are some great drink options on the menu.  However, their happy hour/appetizers menu is lacking in variety.  I was also disappointed with the (tiny) cheese plate.  Overall, I was never overly impressed with the quality of the food, but I enjoy the place for a good drink."}
{"text":"Decent food but overcome by poor and slow service.  Eating on a Saturday night you expect it to be busy and a bit slow, but it took 20 minutes to take our order and over 30 minutes for our food to come out. Our waitress only checked on us at roughly the same interval (only every 20+ minutes). Not impressed. The food was OK; I did like the crispy brussel sprouts and the praline sweet potato; our mains (lobster mac and cheese and crab cake salid) were just OK. Overall, with a lot of other choices in the Golden Triangle I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Had an 8:30 reservation. Didn't seat us until 8:50. No one waited on us for 20 minutes so I told the hostess. She was very apologetic and took our order right away. She got us drinks on the house. Ordered the meatball app and sea scallops. My friend ordered the salmon. Food was absolutely amazing! Besides the minor hiccup at the beginning of our night, we had an excellent experience. Would highly recommend. Food and drinks are bomb! Their brunch is also top notch."}
{"text":"We took out of town guests to Ten Penny on a Saturday night after a Pirates game.  We physically stopped in the week before to make reservations for 8 at 8 pm.  On Saturday my husband checked on the reservation and they did not have it.  They were able to still give us a reservation for an increase of 10 people at 8 pm though.  The service was extremely slow, it took over an hour to receive our food.  On a trip to the restroom my son saw our elusive server dancing in the back of the restraurant.  The food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  But why should the server care his 20% was added right onto our check."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and design are appealing and the brussel sprouts were amazing, however the service was slow and the main dishes were sub par. We had a party of 8 and only one person actually liked their meal. The soup came out barely warm and one person in our party ended up having major stomach issues after leaving the restaurant. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We decided to drop in to TenPenny for a birthday brunch on Sunday for a meal and cocktail.   The best part was definitely the atmosphere and environment.  The layout is thoughtful and trendy - it truly gives off a cool vibe for downtown eating. Our waitress was friendly, but everything moved a bit slowly.  They have a solid Bloody Mary menu that allows you to taste some different combinations or make your own for $10. I decided to make my own and was convinced they didn't put a drop of alcohol in it. Wasn't sure if I paid $10 for tomato juice or a mixed drink to be honest. My wife went for the Raspberry Mojito which was tasty but also lacking punch. Very weak drinks for the price.   For my meal I decided to get the Apple Chicken Sausage Hash which sounded great. I was a bit disappointed when it came out and was just egg and chicken sausage on top of some home fries. Not quite the \"hash\" I was expecting. The portion was fairly small as well.   Bottom line:  If your looking to drop $40 on an okay meal for 2, with a couple weak drinks, in a trendy setting - this place may be for you."}
{"text":"When my family and I journeyed downtown for our annual Celtic Woman concert, we decided to try Ten Penny.  My wife and I started off with the Truffled Mac and Cheese.  She looked up and me only long enough to say, \"It's amazing.\"  I just nodded agreement and got back to work on mine.  I ordered the mussels, and she got the seared scallops with butternut squash risotto.  My parents-in-law also got the scallops.  They all loved them.  The mussels were fresh, the broth delicious, and there was even some delightful sausage in there with them.  They're listed under \"sharables,\" but I wanted them all for myself, and it was the perfect portion.  Everyone got different desserts.  I will say that the ice cream sampler was a bit on the too-small side, but the chocolate chip / peanut cookie fresh-out-of-the-oven was wonderful.  I tried the chocolate hazelnut cake, and it was very nice, too.  Our server, Bart, was very attentive and polite.  He stopped long enough to take a family photo of us when asked, and always kept our drinks full.  \"Another Stella?  Right away, sir.\"  He was also very helpful in pointing out some of his favorite menu items, but he also sang the praises of the other items when we went off his beaten path.  All in all, the experience was excellent, and I'm dreaming of that mac and cheese, and also of those mussels.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Not sure this place deserves even 1 star! Went here for lunch on Saturday a week ago without a reservation. Was told they were booked but we were welcome to sit at the bar and order lunch there. After a considerable wait, we placed a drink order and ordered our meals. In the following hour, we never were asked if we wanted drink refills and when our food finally arrived, we were missing side dishes which we never did receive. My daughter's pulled pork omelette had maybe 3 tiny shreds of pulled pork. Wait staff was apologetic and we were told that a bartender had called off with pink eye leaving them short staffed. We chalked this experience up to an \"off\" day and decided to give the place another chance.  We made reservations for 10 family members for Sunday brunch. We were seated promptly on our arrival, but that's the last good thing I have to say about our experience. After waiting a considerable amount of time, we ordered drinks. When the drinks arrived, we placed our orders. Perhaps half an hour later, we were approached by a manager apologizing that two of our selections were not available as they had \"run out\". After at least another half hour, with no food in sight, we asked to see the manager to inquire about our orders. We were told that the kitchen was finishing up our omelette and the food would be arriving shortly. After another 15 minutes, half of our orders arrived. They were very obviously dried out from being under heat lamps...poached eggs were now hard boiled and omelettes were hard, dry and crusty. Ten minutes later, the rest of our table's orders arrived with COLD omelettes and a salad that was inedible. Once again, we asked to speak with the manager who was busy dealing with other unhappy customers. When she finally made her way to our table, she denied that any of our food had been under heat lamps and asked if we wanted to order something else. As we did not have another 1 1/2 hours to wait, we declined. We did not have to pay for any of our orders, but left without eating and by this time, we were all hungry! Embarrassing because we had invited our family members to join us. Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I were going to dinner before a show at the Benedum Center. First of all, it took forever. My grandmother and aunt came, and they had drove from Indiana, PA, and were starving. Second, we had about 4 servers. I think that a customer should only have one. In addition, my father wanted to order a steak from the dinner menu, and it was about 3:00, and they don't serve dinner until 5:00. You can easily whip up a steak, no problem. But, the waiter declined. He, or she, (since we had 4 servers, I can't keep track) said we couldn't get that steak, and my father had his heart set on it. We got coffee and dessert, and my mother's coffee was cold and ribald. My ice cream was vanilla, extra freezer burnt and appalling! Yelp readers, unite!"}
{"text":"If eaten here 3 time before with much better results. This time my pork chop was over done, my asparagus can out a 4 withered stalks swimming in greasy butter with some bacon crumbled on top. Likely my last trip!"}
{"text":"I roll into this place and it's pretty early so the place is empty. I take a seat at the bar the bartender doesn't greet me.... Hmmmm ok I'll leave that alone I order a Bloody Mary and she runs off...... She comes back never asked what type of vodka I prefer or if I would like a menu. I apparently was an inconvenience to her because she had other patrons at the other end of the bar that she was giving her full attention to. So needless to say I never got anything to eat so I'm gonna take a walk to one of the competitors hopefully I get treated better more to come ......"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after the Anthrocon parade. We had some delicious truffle Mac and cheese, and even with the hectic crowd from after the parade, our server Gavin was super efficient and courteous. We had an excellent meal and will definitely be back! Thanks, Gavin!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I in town for the weekend - pretty dead when we walked in - sat at the bar nice atmosphere food was good - must mention that Kurt the bartender needs a refresh on customer service. Placed our drink orders asked for a menu & he said to us \"I'm gonna need a card\"?   Umm ok how about \"would u like to start a tab?\"  Then asked to have tv changed from movie preview feed when he got a chance, his response \"yes, but your gonna have to give me a minute\" as he walked away. Total of 7 people at the bar."}
{"text":"We want to like this place but so far, the only thing we like (even love) are the brussel sprouts and truffle mac and cheese. We tried this place for New Years, and while our waiter was friendly, that was about the only positive we could give. Overall the service was one of the worst we've ever had--he was constantly forgetting about us, it took forever to put in orders for drinks, appetizers, or dinner, and even when we did, we had to remind him more than once about our drinks that he was literally constantly forgetting. My dinner was actually very good--it was a limited menu that night so I had a filet, but he tried a special for the night, short ribs. As a big meat eater, he was very disappointed because he could not finish them as they were severely overcooked to the point of being inedible.  We wanted to give them another try because my dinner was good and it was a holiday, so we went back again this week. I wish I could say the poor experience the first time was limited to just then, but unfortunately, it did not improve. Our waitress was friendly, but never came to get our initial drink order. Fortunately, a manager did, and it took so long she also took our appetizer and dinner order as well. Food was ok, but given what appears to be an overall culture of crappy service, even when it's not busy (there were plenty of open tables), it is certainly not worth it for us. I'm giving the third star only for how much we love the appetizers which will be sorely missed because I don't think we are willing to put up with not only the hassle of getting there but also the poor service. Oh and to top it off, the waitress took my leftovers but forgot to bring us back the box and sadly, we did not notice until we already left. At least they're consistent in forgetting about serving their customers!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Ten Penny. We liked the rustic atmosphere and decor of TP.  We made reservations for 5 because we were going to see CATS at the Benedum at 8.  We arrived at 4:45 and were surprised to see the restaurant empty except for 3 guys at the bar. We were told the restaurant didn't start serving dinner until 5, so we had a drink at the bar.   The hostess came and got us promptly at 5.  We were seated at a booth with super comfy couches which was by the window looking out onto 10th Street. Our waiter didn't have much of a personality but he was efficient.   As an appetizer, we ordered the Margherita flatbread, which was delicious. I ordered the seared sea scallops with butternut squash risotto and my husband ordered the stuffed chicken breast.   The dinners arrived in a reasonable time. My scallops were perfect and the risotto was to die for. However, they gave me a ton of risotto. I would have preferred to have less risotto along with some sort of vegetable like asparagus, but it was overall a yummy meal. My husband loved his chicken and ended up finishing my risotto. Our waiter did come back and check on is several times despite taking on more tables.    For dessert we shared the peanut butter cookie. It was made & served in a mini cast iron skillet and topped with our choice of ice cream. We chose vanilla. The cookie was warm and moist...delicious!   Our overall experience was wonderful. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Would definitely go again!  Highly recommend to anyone who wants a good dinner before a show in the cultural district."}
{"text":"Excellent food and dining with friendly and courteous staff. A very modern and unique atmosphere that feels open and visually appealing. A trendy facility located in the heart of the city with a fantastic menu."}
{"text":"We had good service but we went for an early dinner at 5:30pm and they had ready run out of my wife's entree of choice on a Saturday night. That was a disappointment but the food was pretty good. The service was really good and our server was great. We would go back but try some different food options."}
{"text":"I went there a few months ago for a birthday dinner with friends. It was a weeknight, but luckily we were able to get the private room on somewhat short notice. A bunch of my guests were running late (like an hour late), but the waitress was nice about it and never made me feel rushed. Everyone loved their food and drinks. With twelve people, we got to sample a significant portion of the menu and everyone seemed happy. Same for drinks. Valet parking is a plus, even though I didnt use it.  I was very happy with the way I was attended to and the overall vibe of the place. I will return often."}
{"text":"Two attempts at having Sunday brunch before theatre failed miserably! First attempt yielded terrible service including a cranky unfriendly waitress.  Today's attempt resulted in our group walking out without eating as we were running late for theatre!  Sat down for 11:15 am reservation;  by 12:30 management said that it would be 8 more minutes! Theater started at 1:00 - - you do the math!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch/ happy hour, I got the steak and fries which was decent, but overpriced. Very good selections of wine and a decent selection of beer. However, throughout my stay I had three different servers that rarely checked in on my table. Overall, the vibe and decor make it a cool happy hour spot, but the service is subpar, and in my opinion the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Great new place in Pittsburgh. Conveniently near the Westin for out-of-towners. Friendly bar service (thanks Zach) and a nice buzz.  Beet salad and bass main were both excellent with interesting sauces. The Rioja by the glass was entirely palatable. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Arrived before the reservation time and we were seated immediately. Server came over quickly and our drink order was entered and arrived in short order. We placed our dinner order, each ordering a ribeye steak, with different degrees of doneness.   So far, no complaints whatsoever. But then the meals were served and things went from good to not so good. The steaks came first, naked on a plate with only a demi-glace sauce giving some cover. It was totally unrecognizable as a ribeye, being less than 1/2\" thick, and looked more like a piece of roadkill. Because of the thinness of the cut, temperature was non-existent. Also, there was no salt or pepper at all on the steak as served.  The sides arrived shortly after the steaks on a separate plate and the server had to use a hot pad to carry them. Unfortunately, only the plate was hot and not the potatoes (I'll admit I didn't even try the brussels sprouts). The potatoes seemed to have been scooped into the dish straight from the refrigerator and what ever was used to heat the plate failed to heat the potatoes. The bacon in the potatoes was absolutely cold.  In all, the meal was less than mediocre. It was not worth anything near the $32 charged. I've had better steak and potatoes at Golden Corral. It was especially disappointing as some of the other meals that passed by the table actually looked quite good.   I have nothing bad to say about the service."}
{"text":"Drinks were excellent, but that's as far as it goes.  Weird menu selections, subpar food, took 15 mins to get a server to bring water and take our order."}
{"text":"I've lived in pittsburgh all my life, drove past the ten penny since its opening, so today i finally got a chance to take in some of traditional american food and atmosphere, i really wanted to have a nice lunch but all i had was a really bad lunch on this holiday, first off the bar  staff needs to be fired, very unprofessional, sloppy, not meant to be behind the bar.... blonde,and dark hair barmaids,        slow service and terrible food....    stay away....   far far far away...."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for business and we stopped by for dinner during the week.  They were pretty well packed.  We waited at the bar until our table was ready.  The drinks were good and the food was really tasty.  We had a little of everything from the menu.  Wedge salad, fries, red curry, pasta, pork chop and the special for the night, a smoked short rib (which was huge).    Only area that might need a little tune up.... the service.  I think she was just too busy.  She just dropped dessert menus and walked away.  She came back a few minutes later and asked if we wanted dessert.  Kind of backwards to me.  This is the reputation of the place.  Good food and drinks, service is spotty.  I think we got better that average service, but not like most place.  I would go back.  Food was too good not to try again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal space. This was a fabulous venue for hanging out at the bar with friends. Did not sample the food this time around though."}
{"text":"I heard mixed reviews about this restaurant so I decided to try it for myself. I was totally disappointed. Firstly, there was confusion between our server and the manager. No one was certain who was doing what or if our order was taken. After the initial confusion subsided, my crab cake appetizer arrived room temperature. I let our server know and she seemed annoyed. I understand it's not her fault and I'm not asking for anything to be removed from the bill, but someone needs to know that the food isn't at the right temperature. That's dangerous! My steak was delicious, however. I did order dessert. The ice cream that came with the dish TURNED! The ice cream was actually soured! I have never had bad ice cream before and was shocked. I again told the server who was even more annoyed. She took the plate and returned shortly thereafter. She said she tried it and would remove both the app and the dessert from the bill. All of this was done with an attitude that made me feel I was an inconvenience. When we were leaving she sarcastically said, \"It was a pleasure serving you!\"  How bizarre! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome vibe inside and beautifully decorated. There was a lot to choose from on the menu and though many would probably consider it was pricey.... I went into it expecting it to cost more than your average place so I didn't have a problem with it. I wanna go back!!"}
{"text":"This is a really worthwhile stop in Pittsburgh. I've visited twice for brunch and have been impressed with everything I've ordered. The drinks are creative and fresh. The carrot cake pancakes are a must-order- just make sure yours are cooked through, unlike mine... Although the flavors were so to-die-for, I still ate around the edges! I think my favorite part would have to be the atmosphere- lots of exposed brick, rustic wood, and antique lighting."}
{"text":"We decided to leave the North Hills for dinner on a Saturday night..  we were pleasantly surprised to get a table for 4.  The atmosphere is really great.  I love the décor and the comfortable booths with the wide open windows-  exactly what we were looking for.    We ordered the hot rocks- super fun for the kids.  I was a little alarmed that they didn't offer separate forks for the raw meat and seafood.   My kids both ordered the strip steak.  I suppose they thought they could serve the kids a subpar piece of meat, but I was still paying $32 per plate.  Ordered it medium rare- steak was tough and cold and gross in the middle.   The potatoes were enjoyable as was the calamari.    Our waiter was aloof and rarely returned to check on us.  Possibly the worst part of the evening was the fact that the valet LEFT OUR CAR ON in front of the restaurant.  I would return for happy hour.  The bar was vibrant and the list of beers and cocktails was extensive.  Maybe not the best place for dinner, but appetizers and drinks would be ok."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a few drinks with the girls after dinner.  The bartender was super nice and attentive.  The atmosphere was great.  It was tough to find parking on a Saturday night - although they do have valet for $10.  However, I was happy to see that downtown Pgh was busy, so I didn't mind."}
{"text":"We had a party of 25 for dinner with reservations...when we got there they had difficulty seating...2 of us had to sit at the bar, which was basically empty while there were plenty of other seats empty as well.  I sat at the bar and had to flag someone down to get a drink.  Plenty on tap...the one waiter did not know the local beers, so he got what I believe was the manager to come over.  Super nice and accommodating...walked us through the beers and gave us samples (which by the way, sour beer is yucky)... had to flag another waiter down to order...I ordered the mega meatball, because of the reviews...and the fries.  Meatball was good...not sure it would be worth ordering again.  It was moist and not much fillers.  The sauce was rich and very tasty.   The fries were outstanding...they had truffle oil infused...the friend I was with said she had the same fried the night before at the Westin directly across the street which were $3 cheaper and better...The rest of our party said food was ok but service was incredibly slow.  They only had one server for both drinks and food orders..I've been in the food business...most times with party that big and the restuarant not super crowded they put at least 2 wait staff on... good but personally, I would not go back..."}
{"text":"Drinks and mediocre food served on island time. My group of 5, sat at the bar for 15 minutes before receiving service, when less than half the restaurant was occupied.  The only redeeming thing about their superior location is the close proximity of better restaurants."}
{"text":"We went for the brunch on a Saturday. Overall, this place has great decor and average food (at least for brunch). It caters to a trendier restaurant-goer at an average price. I would go again if joining a group but wouldn't go out of my way for it.   Ambience: Modern and open. Loved the location and decor. Definitely what I would expect for a downtown restaurant. I would suggest this place for small groups on an evening or at lunch.   Food: I can't really comment on lunch or dinner since we went for a weekend brunch. The food was average- interesting options but under executed. We started with the Margherita Flatbread which was under seasoned and overly greasy. Being adventurous, I tried the Carrot Cake Pancakes. I'll give them an A for effort but D for flavor. The pancakes were thick and moist like I prefer them but the flavor profile was off. The pancakes were surprisingly not very sweet but the carrots were overpowering and rum-pineapple syrup a bizarre addition. A little cinnamon mixed in with the pancake batter and a different syrup altogether might have salvaged the dish."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and extensive wine list. We came in for a late night meal after touring PGH and needed food. We found the right spot! We mainly munched on apps. The Mac and cheese was excellent and serving size was huge. All items were big to the point we could have ordered half of what we did and been fine. Waitress was awesome and served us well. Definitely come back on our next trip to PGH."}
{"text":"I think it was overpriced for the food but the ambiance is lovely, the waitress was fantastic and management was good. The portions are large and would have liked a smaller portion with a smaller price tag on main item, which I had, of Ahi tuna. it is always a shame to have so much and have to leave it when you are traveling. The crispy brussel sprouts were good but too much sauce, I would have liked them plainer and crispier.  The calamari was over breaded and not to my liking and for these reasons i gave it a 3 star. Would I go back, not sure, due to price mostly when there are many other options without having to spend so much. With dessert my bill came for one person, no drinking involved, to over $43 which is a little high to me! Dessert was nice, the apple tart, but the Ice Cream was overly liquored, again, for me. I liked it otherwise."}
{"text":"The service was so so, usually when there is a shift change at the bar it is nice to let those with tabs know you'll be leaving. That didn't happen. Late afternoon they have a very limited menu. I ordered the penne marinara and meatball. The meatball was barely lukewarm and a tad overcooked. I wasn't a fan of the seasoning selection in the sauce. The menu listed that it was served with garlic bread. It did not come out with it and when I inquired the bartender didn't know if it did or didn't but he would get me a piece. When it came out it was overdone.   In the end, cool decor and good location. Kinks need worked out and more attention paid attention to details."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here this evening for a girl's night, since it was close to the other stops we had made.  Jen (sweet, blonde young lady) was our waitress and was spot on.  I had some very specific order adjustments that needed to happen and she was on top of it...and without judgement or annoyance.  I had the strip with roasted Brussels and everything was as ordered and delicious.  My friend had the meatloaf and had zero complaints...even took home leftovers.  The ONLY reason I gave 4 was because the couch looking seats could use updating.  The one I was seated at looked like my dog tried to eat it and it wasn't very comfortable.  Otherwise, Jen was awesome and the food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great location. Poor service. Overpriced food.   I patronized Ten Penny twice on a recent weekend visit to Pittsburgh. The first time, only for drinks.  The second time, for brunch based on a recommendation and the convenient location near my hotel. My level of satisfaction just seemed to decrease the more time I was at Ten Penny.  The first visit was for drinks. I liked the atmosphere.  Having the doors open along the perimeter of the place to take in the beauty of summer made for a fun and welcoming feel. The beer selection was nice, with a number of local brews on tap but not being a local I had a few questions. The bartender could neither describe nor recommend a beer to me. What a disappointment!   The next day we returned for brunch hoping that the food experience would top the drinking experience of the previous day.  Boy, were we wrong. Our waiter was very nice.  That was the only good thing that morning. The food took forever.  The drinks took ages--I mean,  what does it take to make a mimosa? I was half expecting to see someone walk in with a case of bubbly because running out was the only reason I could come up with waiting 20 min for a mimosa in a relatively empty restaurant. When our food came, some orders were cold,  some had mistakes and some  didn't even arrive,  at least not until others had pretty much finished their meals.  I've never seen such.  All in all, I  would not go back if in town again and I wouldn't recommend Ten Penny to others."}
{"text":"The reviews and ratings are pretty accurate. The food was very average. I wanted to like this place so much that I made myself think I liked it more than I did. But, the more I got through my meal, I realized that I didn't like it that much. And by the time I left, I settled on a \"meh.\" I ordered the shrimp and scallops risotto. I should have gone with my gut, but I've had great experiences at 3-star rated restaurants, but it was not the case here.   The waitress warned me that the dish had a lot of risotto and most people do not finish, but I had no idea. It was sooo much risotto and only TWO scallops and about 4 shrimp for about $30. Way too overpriced. Lessen the massive amount of risotto and give an extra scallop or two OR lower the price. It is not worth it. As far as taste, it was okay. The risotto was a little salty and not too edible after about 5 or 6 bites. It was really cheesy, which normally is a great thing, but not for this dish. I really just ate the scallops and shrimp which were pretty good and cooked almost perfectly. I also ordered a side of truffle fries, which were, again, just okay. Not bad. If I came here again, I would probably get a burger. It seems that most people here were eating burgers. So, maybe that is the way to go.   Overall, it was a three. My waitress was pretty helpful and she genuinely tried to engage in conversation with me so that boosts the rating. You can try some of the other menu items, but you've been warned."}
{"text":"We need to find a new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. After a few years of exclusive dining at Ten Penny and being very happy we had two mediocre experiences in a row; most recently Friday Feb 2. First up let's say that the waitress 'Augusta' was good; unlike the disinterested staff (and mediocre food) our last visit. We rescheduled the reservation due to traffic and snow, found that they reported us as a no-show on Open Table - their official service. The drinks - my wife's - like drinking lemon juice; mine - forgot the dirty part of the martini - all not too bad. The food - Truffled Mac & Cheese - 'bland' nothing like when it was on the menu previously which was a must-have.  My Strip Steak - very good slightly over rare but tender and tasty.  Truffled Fries were good. Sweet Potato good too. Her $40 fillet arrived almost medium-well ordered rare.  Sent it back with apologies from the manager.  Second steak came out refrigerator cold in the center, gave up didn't complain; split my steak and took the fillet home to cook - the staff could see the fillet was untouched when they brought the box - expected at least a comment !?   Overall disappointing - a local told me the place has gone down hill - OK for drinks but last time we will be there for food."}
{"text":"....pleasantly surprised. Excellent service and the meatball app was amazingly delicious and then the cornbread took us over the moon! Sitting outside on a beautiful evening!"}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to eat here yet, as it is this review is just for the bar. We stopped here in the middle of an afternoon to grab a cocktail with some family. Unfortunately our bartender wasn't very pleasant and certainly hasn't mastered her craft.  I ordered a beer and really can't complain, but everyone else in my group had a mixed drink and a not a single one liked what they ordered. I can honestly say I was a little taken aback by that fact as it was unusual.   We didn't stick around much longer, the bartender was made aware of heir distaste for their drinks and didn't offer to make something else instead."}
{"text":"Not great for eating gluten-free. Service was lackluster. Apparently Yelp requires this to be longer. So... the server seemed annoyed by me asking about gluten-free options. He possessed no knowledge of his own about which items on the menu would accommodate this restriction. Additionally, the service was slow and inattentive, despite the restaurant not being busy. The hostess was friendly so that's one good thing. It wasn't a terrible experience, but neither was it good. I doubt I would go back when I can walk one block I any direction and hit another, better eatery."}
{"text":"I guess I went in with expectations too great.  Their Instagram  is amazing.  I've been dying to try their brunch.  It's marathon weekend and they are right across the street from the convention center.  We stop in for brunch.  It's busy but there is no wait for a table.  Our server brings water and we ordered.  My daughters order the Ten Penny burger and the chicken sandwich.   I ordered the breakfast flatbread; sorry they don't have it.  I ordered the Smoked salmon omelet.  Sorry that's not available either.  Apparently we have old menus.  So I order the strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes. Our server brings more water.  Forty five minutes later I can't even find our server.  I think she's avoiding us.  Finally an hour later she brings our food and 'apologizes again' with a manager behind her.  That was our first apology.  My daughter enjoyed the burger.  My other daughter ate the chicken sans bun as the coleslaw had soaked through the bun.  Both thought the fries were great. My pancakes weren't anything special, not much flavor and very little lemon.  The manager stopped to tell us she had made an adjustment to our check.  The server also told us she adjusted the check.  It was an okay meal but I would have liked to be kept more informed on the delay.  Maybe offered an appetizer or a beverage or just an apology for the delay."}
{"text":"Ten penny is nothing to brag about. The atmosphere is super cute and I absolutely love the decor, but the food is just okay. I've eaten here a couple times and have never been impressed. I went there yesterday with a group of 6 & decided to finally write a review. I'd give this place 5 stars for the decorations and look of the restaurant, but the food is more of a 2. Prior to 4pm on Saturday, they only have a very limited menu. I got the points Burgh salad with steak & the steak was extremely dry and over cooked. My friend got the same salad with chicken and said the same thing, over cooked meat. Another friend got the sliders and was not impressed either. We did however like the Mac & cheese and the fries. I will say I saw others ordering flat breads that looked really good, but we didn't get one. I'd like to try a flat bread some other time maybe. Our server was really friendly and nice, but it took forever to get our food after ordering, like 30 mins? Drinks are pretty pricy as well. I don't dislike ten penny, but I am not dying to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Stopped in for late nights apps after an event, the only thing worth commenting on were the Brussel Sprouts. They were quite good. The rest of the food was blah.  Ordered one cocktail, it was weak and the flavor dilluted quickly with their tiny ice chips."}
{"text":"I would have given it one star but the manager tried to redeem a really bad experience.  I ordered the Pittsburgh Traditional Salad for lunch.  It was supposed to come with French Fries and either chicken/steak.  When I received my salad, all I received was basically a bed of lettuce with a hard boiled egg, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  The waiter came to check on me and I told him that this was not as described on the menu.  So, he begrudgingly brought me fries back out and acted like I did not know how to read a menu. When I inquired why there was no meat, he actually lied to me and indicated that I would have to pay more for the meat.  When I got my bill, I was charged $14 for a bed of lettuce.  So I went up to the hostess and reviewed the menu which indicated that I should have received everything else on the salad at no extra charge.  The manager did give me my lunch for free but the fact that the waiter blatantly lied to me and then tried to tell the manager that it was a big misunderstanding really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"I haven't had their food yet, but I've been here a few times in the night life. It's a really cool spot and a good location. Drinks are good and the staff is friendly. I enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"I would highly suggest the truffle fires to start...they were to die for! I also suggest asking for a table near the windows, it was gorgeous!   I do believe the mega meatball is overrated. It just was very plain and nothing special. That being said, the service was amazing! Our waitress noticed that I hadn't eaten the meatball and didn't want to take it home so she didn't charge me for it. Definitely made up for the fact that I didn't enjoy it! Will be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing. I wasn't to impressed with the food. But you do have a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ten Penny Burger without the onion relish - as i have an allergy to onions.  The  \"pickled vegetables\" were ON the burger, not as a side, which I'd expected, and the vegetables, including onions, were cut to itty bitty pieces, about the size of the pieces of chopped pickles in a relish!  SO i ended up with onions (in the \"pickled veggies\") on my burger anyway - unnoticed until too late.  The restaurant was hot and we were offered a table that was NOT under a ceiling fan but our request to move to a table under a fan was honored.  Still, on a hot and sticky day, it was uncomfortably warm. I was disappointed that fries were the option for the burger, rather than home made chips, as many restaurants offer.  Our server alerted the manager about the onion issue, and she offered to make another for me, but it was too late at that point.  We didn't pursue our concern/complaint further because oddly enough, we were dining with a gift card given to us on our previous visit because of numerous mistakes with our order (including one re: onions - but numerous other errors at our table of 4) and after this second less than happy experience, we knew we'd not return in any case.  We had more disappointments with our food during these 2 visits to this restaurant than any other restaurant where we've dined in recent years. It is worth mentioning that the staff here is concerned and kind about mistakes -- and obviously are willing to do what needs to be done to correct them - it's just that if more attention were paid to not MAKING the problems in the first place, the dining experience would be more pleasant - as is the case in most of the restaurants that we frequent."}
{"text":"First off..the food is good!  This this is my 4th time here and the service could be better!  Where is the manager?  The bartenders are more worried about cleaning/closing up rather than serving drinks!  Also,  there is way too much personal chatter behind the bar....serve some drinks!!!"}
{"text":"A few blocks from the theaters.  Great place for dinner before a show.  It is LOUD even when you aren't seated by the bar.  The waitresses are well versed in the menu - trust their recommendations ...   Large portions ... great house salad ... had the salmon with summer vegetables ... perfect.  I was full not stuffed ...   Great spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! Love the atmosphere, food, and service. Michael is the best waiter and really helped make our ladies dinner extra special. The desserts are served in such a fun way. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The location and atmosphere are great but I've never had anything up to par with the atmosphere off the menu. Overall I was underwhelmed by the food here the 3 different times I have been. My burger was overcooked and not well seasoned (ordered medium and received well done) and the price and presentation wasn't anything impressive. Waitstaff was average as well. In general just a very so-so experience every time.   Overall, I would recommend going here for a drink/happy hour but there's better options to eat in the downtown area in my opinion."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner before going to a show. We made a reservation for 6 pm, and when we got there, we were promptly seated. The decor in the place is super cute. We had time to check it out because our waiter was slow to come over to our table. We asked for a drink menu and ordered a round of drinks. A while later, our waiter came back to take our orders. We started with the deviled egg trio, then my friend got a bowl of tomato bisque soup, a salad, and asparagus. I got the NY strip with morrow butter and a side of mashed potatoes. I've looked at other reviews mentioning how the food was just OK, but i have to say, our food was delicious! My steak was cooked perfectly (even the waiter was like \"wow that's a good looking steak\") and my friends soup was very flavorful. Our waiter disclosed that he had only been working there for two weeks and they were short staffed, so I am not holding the slowness against Ten Penny. The reason I gave it four stars though is because this place isn't very vegetarian or vegan friendly. My friend was basically a vegetarian during lent, and he had a hard time finding something on the menu. Other than that, we had a good experience there. I would go back."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Very disappointed. We started with the Truffle Mac And cheese. It was overcooked.  The cheese plate had cheese I never heard of.  I had the American Clam Bake, again overcooked.    It's a shame this group owns this space because something really cool could be at this location."}
{"text":"I made a mistake in my original review of this restaurant and I apologize.  I mistook the Ten Penny for another place in a completely different neighborhood.  Mea culpa!  We stopped in her the night that my daughter went to prom and had dinner.  While the place is loud, the food is really good.  Our server did a wonderful job in taking care of us and I would definitely go back.  The only drawback is how live the space is."}
{"text":"Simply awful service. Walked in for brunch and waited 5 minutes for the hostess to \"clear a table\" (there was no one in the place), and when we were finally sat, no one - I mean not one person - came over to greet us, pour water, tell us they'll be right with us... Nothing. After perusing the mediocre-looking menu, we looked around and tried to make eye contact with someone - anyone - to place an order. No one came over, ever. We waited 15 minutes and then left to go to to Meat & Potatoes - a much more pleasant experience (and an awesome menu).   Don't waste your time on Ten Penny."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow both times that I ate here. With the competition in the city now when it comes to good restaurants, the food here is not enough to make up for the slow service. Hopefully they can improve. I'll try again in a few months and see how things go."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I gave this restaurant a second chance because I was so underwhelmed the first time; I thought it had to be a bad night.   The overall look of the restaurant is great. The brick and wood finishes really give a cozy, warm vibe.   My qualm is with the service and food selection. I'll start with the food. The first time I came with a group of about 8 before a concert. I think 2 out of the 8 people got the correct meal, and some didn't even have a meal come out. I got a flatbread pizza and split an order of the Brussels sprouts with my friend. My meal was good, overall, but I was one of the two who got the correct meal. The second time I came with a group of 18. They split us into two tables, which was perfect with such a large group. I went out on a limb and got the pork chop special and I was pretty happy with my choice. I will say that I'm never overly impressed with the menu options- but I am just one person.   The service both times was atrocious. Drinks were mixed up (we played \"pass the wine\" a few times until we all got what we actually ordered) and the overall service was incredibly slow. Checks were incorrect and jumbled to end the night.   Hopefully they sort out the serving issue because I do think the potential is there."}
{"text":"Not sure yet...reviews are not great...stay tuned.  It was okay, the service is a bit slow, but that has already been noted.  The fries were very good and my sausage was just like I thought it would be.  I was reluctant to order much because this restaurant did not have good reviews and I was there on a work function.  Not much to say other than it was not bad, but I would not go back until I see that management has made a change and the reviews reflect it.  Note: The paper towels in the bathroom were amazingly soft."}
{"text":"I passed this place a few times while being downtown for a show and wanted to try it out-the big open windows and industrial décor drew me in!  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch (well they call it brunch) before a Pirates game.  We were seated at a large high top table right away.  While we did not order a drink they had a nice draft list. My friend and I both opted to get lunch rather than a breakfast item although the pancakes sounded fantastic. We went with the cobb salad which came with chopped  turkey, avocado, blue cheese, egg, bacon and peas which were a great addition to the salad.  The ingredients were fresh and plentiful and the dressing (some sort of creamy vinaigrette) was fantastic. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Love the interior. That was the best part. It's what I would call industrial chic and reminded me of a cool downtown loft. There were lots of windows, so lots of natural light.  We stopped in for a meal around the 3:00 hour. I was disappointed to find a very limited lunch menu that was also cross billed as a late night menu. I was told it was because the kitchen was already prepping for dinner. Something to keep in mind if you want to eat between \"tradional\" meal times.  Because our visit coincided with National Margarita Day, I had one. Very sad. It tasted like sweet & sour margarita mix and that's about all. Granted I'm from California, where we know our margaritas, but this was way below average.  For my meal, I chose the chicken sandwich. It came with melted cheddar cheese and was on what seemed to be a \"homemade\" bun. Tasty. The French fries which accompanied it had a good flavor. I especially liked the rough texture of their outsides. Daughter had the green Thai chicken. While she said it wasn't bad, it also didn't taste like the authentic version you'd get in a real Thai restaurant.  I went with the Creme Brûlée trio for dessert--a unique idea which paid off. One was orange infused, one was peppermint (which tasted better than it sounds) and one was hot chocolate with marshmallow fluff on top. Apparently flavors rotate so ask on your visit."}
{"text":"This was okay.  The food read better than it is.  Service was good but quality and quantity of food were a bit disappointing.  I'd go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this a one star! It was that bad!!  How about if I just post the pictures I HAD to take, because we could not believe that they were giving these to the customers to consume.  DISGUSTING!  And  GROSS!  There is actually dried on food and ketchup stuck to the entire bottle!!!!!!!!  We actually took another bottle from the next table and it was worse than the first one.  Now, you can make you own decisions as to weather you want to take a chance on this place because WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!  We asked to speak to the manager (Craig, we were told his name) and were told two different stories as to why he couldn't see us ..saying that he was out of the building but yet his name is on the receipt that he cashed us out! Hmmmmm! Interesting!   To top it off! They only took $10.20 off for the $16.00 burger that I couldn't think of eating after seeing that bottle.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!   Stupid expensive too!! Definitely not worth paying $100. for 3 lunches!!!   Please, please, please, don't waste you money on this place. Take these remarks seriously and dine at one of the many other wonderful restaurants in the \"burgh\" that take pride giving you awesome service fantastic food and cleanliness is their top concern.    I will be putting a complaint in to the health department."}
{"text":"Just enjoying drinks but food looks good! Sevice was friendly at bar and atmosphere is very modern and clean"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside however the service is lacking at best. Waited at the table 15 minutes finally had to ask the hostess to get service. Out of several beers o the menu, food just so so  Don't plan on going back  Too back cause it could be a great place"}
{"text":"I had dinner here recently with a group.  We received excellent service and great food.  This restaurant has a nice, quiet atmosphere and we were able to converse without yelling at each other.  I highly recommend the Ten P. Burger!   The scallops were excellent as well.  The peanut butter cookie is a wonderful dessert choice!"}
{"text":"Place seems nice, menu has some potential but the delivery of food is a disaster.  When traveling I try to order safe and ask for things like a ceasar salad with salmon.  Seemed like a nice place and I ordered the ceasar salad with salmon.  The salmon was great.  The salad was an unchopped display of two romaine hearts on a small plate.  I have a dull knife that struggles to cut these full romaine hearts.  This is a stupid presentation of unwashed romaine hearts with a glob of dressing on top.  I emailed this place directly with my feedback and got some sort of answering service.   3 emails later I decided to post this.  This place does not care about what they serve to customers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and location are great for this restaurant. It is right downtown across from the Westin hotel and convention Center. Trendy casual atmosphere. Unfortunately the service and food were not very good. For our apps, the meatball was excellent, but the Brussels sprouts were mushy and soaked in sweet sauce that tasted like syrup. For our entrees we had the mussels which had no sauce or seasoning at all, just dry plain mussels. We also had the catfish. The catfish itself was good but the hush puppies were terrible as they were dried out and hard. The chicken with kale wasn't good either.  The kale was so salty and spicy we couldn't eat it. The service was poor too. While we did get our food in a reasonable time, our service was not good. We sat with empty drinks and water for 15-20 mins and watched the waiter walk by several times. When we tried to get his attention he kept walking. We had to go to the bar to get drinks for our table. Every glass and plate was still on our table when we paid for our bill as nothing was cleared from our table the whole time we were there. It is not a wonder that the bar ran out of wine glasses and ended up serving our white wine in a tumbler!  To top it all off, we watched an employee use the washroom and leave without washing their hands!  I would not go back.  There are lots of other restaurants in the area I would go to instead."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Affordable.  3 things I believe makes an eatery standout. Server was friendly and accommodating when I decided to spill my beverage all over the place.  Had the mega meatball and the cheese plate.  Great prices for really good food.  Dining companion had the margarita pizza flatbread, which also looked great. Definitely recommend as a quick bite during the day or later in the evening.  Nice corner set-up with open doors so you can experience the brief hint of spring weather that we had this week!"}
{"text":"The Caesar salad was different.  An entire curled strip of bacon on the side. Just the right amount of dressing and yes you will need a big boy knife to cut the romaine.  Nice.  The New York Strip was \"Ok\".  Anyone who reads my reviews or knows me knows I'm a red meat junkie.  I make a mean steak on the grill with the right piece of meat, so  hard to impress in a restaurant.  Ten Penny's was a nice cut, medium rare of course.  It was slightly and I mean slightly over cooked. Closer to medium.  Im not a fan of the glazed, borderline A1 sauce on the steak.  I know a lot of people like this, I simply do not. Call me a purist.  It was good, just not great.   I was eyeballing the crab stuffed flounder.  I will do that next time.   Ok on to dessert.  I don't typically \"eat\" dessert and tonight was no exception.   Me: \"Do you have Ports?\"  Joyce (my bartender): \"Of Course....in the Tawny Ports we have Sandeman 10, 20, 30 and 40 year and we...\"  Me (interrupting): \"Stop it...can I see a menu?\"  Joyce (laughing): \"be right back\"  Nice Port selection and yes I had the 60 year.  A 20 and a 40. :p  In my horrible Arnold impersonation \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Great interior. We had a large party, so unfortunately we did not get to sit at the \"booth\" tables that are actually couches. Our table was a little awkward. With people actually sitting in the seats it was a little difficult to for the waiters to walk behind us to the bar. Even though it was empty when we showed up, it took a lot of time for our drinks to be brought to the table and our waiter was a little bit absent. Mind you, these were two draft beers, one bottle, and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar. To our waiter's credit, though, a few others and I showed up an hour before the reservation so I don't think he was quite prepared. Draft list wasn't huge, but they had a few locals.  Unfortunately for us the oven they used for flat breads wasn't working. Usually this isn't a big deal, except for that virtually everything else on the menu had meat on it apart from salads. There was only one veggie entree, even though the entree list was expansive. I always find that to be super disappointing in restaurants like this that are trying to cater to youngish, trendy crowds. There were 2 vegetarians in our party of 7 and they had difficulty with the menu.   Brussel sprouts were awesome (had bacon), was not a fan of the truffle fries. The aoili didn't taste like anything at all, even though it was supposed to be bacon flavored. Not a bad taste, not a good taste, not an okay taste, just like nothing. I got the mahi + wheat berries. Mahi was just okay, but the wheat berries were awesome. They were served drenched in a glaze with cranberries and oranges. So, so good. Husband was not impressed with his pasta dish. It came out in a huge bowl but apparently it was more of a soup than a real entree.   This place is right by the convention center, and parking is terrible. We got  there before 6, when rush hour restrictions were still in place, and were totally unable to park on the street. We ended up parking in the convention center's garage, which was convenient, but the garage was full by the time my sister got there after six and she also struggled to park.  Overall I would try this place again. My food was good enough, although the quality of the mahi could have been improved. My overall impression is that this place really wants to be trendy. They've put a lot of work into the interior, the cocktail list, many of the food items have bacon or buzzing grain items (like wheat berries!), but they really need to be putting more work into the quality of the food so that people will come back. If I went again and the food was the same quality there would not be a third visit."}
{"text":"Despite the really hip and inviting appearance from the decor, the food is quite disappointing. The price seems a little high for only okay food (around $15 per brunch item). My husband and I came for brunch and the tables were mostly filled with convention center out of towners. We ordered Brussels sprouts, eggs benedict and the breakfast pizza. The sprouts were a mess, salty and fatty and bitter. Eggs Benedict had little hollandaise sauce so it was dry. The breakfast pizza dough was raw which made eating the pizza impossible. The atmosphere and the location right next to 2 hotels and convention center is key for this restaurant's survival, because the food ain't helping."}
{"text":"Had great expectations for Ten Penny. Service was horrible. Kitchen forgot our appetizer. I had the meatloaf. It was excellent. 3 others had the mac n cheese and said it was average. Dessert was a disaster. 25 minutes after ordering we had to track down a manager to find out where it was. She apologized and said one of the items took 20 minutes to prepare and it would be out in a few minutes. It was 15 more. She did comp the desserts and gave us a much appreciated discount. But it doesn't make up for our experience. I would have been happier had the server been more open with us about the delays. Instead she avoided us."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst service I've had sitting at a bar in a while. We went when bar wasn't extremely busy, but there was only one bartender working a fairly large bar. It took the bartender about 10 minutes to acknowledge that we sat down.  Shortly after, a group of ladies that sat down beside us and got service right away. As the bartender finish up serving the last one, he asked us if we knew what we wanted and walked away. After walking around for another 5 minutes he finally came to take our drink orders. He warned me about the drink I had ordered and got me a sample (which was the only reason I gave the second star). He proceeded to walk away and clean up the bar.   Overall he didn't pay much attention to what was going on at the bar, but he was scurrying around all over the place. Could definitely use some improvement in the bar management skills."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. We arrived around 2:00pm and planned on having lunch. Only to find out the menu posted on the outside of the restaurant is not available and they only let us order off of a very limited \"Late Lunch Menu\". \"Late Lunch Menu, wtf, it's 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, we can't be the only people eating lunch at 2:00pm on a Saturday afternoon. Their \"Late Lunch Menu\" absolutely sucked! We wanted a burger, but the only burger they offered on the late lunch menu was a chorizo burger, wtf??? I ended up ordering the short rib flatbread pizza and it was disgusting, the meat was fatty, tough and rubbery, it was smothered with a horseradish sauce they would have been good had there not been so much of it all over the flatbread. To add insult to injury our waiter sucked, the place was not even busy and he was never anywhere to be found. Stay away from this place, we had a bad experience, and I was borderline close to leaving just a 1 star review, it's that bad. Manager and chef both need to be fired for such as crappy menu offering."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice in the past month and I think it's just terrific!  The service is excellent and the food was just as good.   Of course, I had to have the famous brussel sprouts and they did not disappoint.  Consider that I typically wouldn't touch a brussel sprout with a ten foot pole but these were special. I highly recommend them.   We ordered the Truffled Mac 'n Cheese which is decadent and very rich.  I recommend sharing this and I'm would not get it again but it was worth trying.  The Mediterranean flat bread was excellent and also a good item to share.  The Port-Poached Pear salad was very good and I'd get this again.    Another one of the table favorites was the Truffled French Fries.  Normally, I pass on fries but these were addictive!  I'd get these again as a shared item.    I ordered the Stuffed Murray's Amish Chicken Piccata and absolutely loved this meal! It was perfect for the cold, snowy day and was served hot.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and perfect.  I'd get this again.   On my second visit, I ordered the Mega Meatball.  I have to say, this was my biggest disappointment.  It was lacking in flavor and texture.  This was the only thing I tasted from this restaurant that I didn't like.    I like that you can order different sizes of wine from the wine list: anywhere from a 3 ,6 to a 9 oz glass of wine.  Perfect.  I loved the atmosphere and can't wait to come back when they open the large glass doors surrounding the restaurant.  It's located on a corner and has such a great view of the area.   I do recommend that if you make a reservation for here that you ask for a booth or a regular table.  We made reservations but didn't specify where we wanted to sit and were put at a high top table.  While this would be okay if we were there for just drinks and appetizers, it was uncomfortable for dinner.  The chairs are a bit shallow and cut into our thighs which made all of us uncomfortable for the 1.5 hours we sat there. And no, we aren't over-sized individuals!  The service was excellent and our server had excellent timing on our courses and making sure we had enough to drink.    Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Overpriced, bad service and mediocre food.  This place is your classic convention center rip off. if you are stuck across the street at the hotel it would make sense to eat here. Other than that... there is no reason for a local Pittsburgher to even pay dahntahn parking when there are so many better restaurant options throughout the city."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's in an awkward place... I guess for the convention center crowd, but I don't feel like anyone ever goes to the convention center. Regardless, our service was good, super friendly, and helpful with the menu. We had the private dinner menu 2:  Dinner Menu 2 $45 per person excluding tax and gratuity Non-alcoholic beverage Appetizer Mega meatball | Pumpkin soup | Roasted vegetable ravioli- I tried the soup and ravioli, both were VERY good. The soup was hearty and the ravioli had a great flavor  Salad Mixed greens salad, balsamic vinaigrette- Amazing dressing. I liked that they let us put the toppings on  Entree-didn't try any of these   Dessert Chocolate pretzel tort | Crème brulee trio- desserts were amazing!"}
{"text":"Bad experience made worse by the defensive response of the management. The bartender was very nice and the wait staff were very personable. However, we had an unreasonably long wait for our food (30 mins between appetizer and entree). Moreover, during that time we had not one visit from restaurant personnel (ie to offer an explanation or even refill our drinks). We brought this to the attention of the manager. His response, while very nicely presented, was inexplicably defensive. At that point we asked for the check, paid the bill and will not be back.  Unfortunate, because the food was excellent. However, there are many restaurants in Pittsburgh with excellent food as well as service."}
{"text":"Ten Penny is a very nice addition to the mid range/high end food scene in Pittsburgh. It's located right across from the Greyhound terminal, so not in the choicest part of downtown, but it does make it relatively easier to find parking! Just as an FYI - they do have valet, it's $10 (steep!) that you pay on the spot, and then if you eat at the restaurant, they refund you $3 off your bill. Kind of weird, if you ask me.  Interior decor is very much in line with Cure and Pig and Chicken, with the warmed up industrial wood/reclaimed iron/brick aesthetic. What I liked about it was that it was spacious, and thus, probably can accommodate larger parties (unlike Cure) and also the noise level was manageable. So, a very comfortable, informal place to have good food and good drink. Service is friendly!  They have a very extensive wine menu, and very knowledgeable staff to help you make your choice. We actually tried three different wines before settling on one. It was very nice of them to be so willing to try and make sure we got something we really liked.   Food was good, but not exceptional. We started with the mushroom flatbread (fine) and crabcakes (good!). Three of us had the filet, which was a seriously large hunk of meat. Very tender, but I felt as though mine was a bit underseasoned, even though it came with a nice demi-glaze sauce. The filets came with sides of brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, both of which could have used more salt. The other person in our party had the duck, which was also good, but not out of this world.  We tried two desserts: the dessert special, which was a hazelnut tart, and the bombe off the usual dessert menu. The bombe was truly the bombe - definitely recommend it.  All in all, a success. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Sat down and waited 10 minuets before I got the attention of three hostesses having a conversation. Once one hostess came over she said she wasn't a server and couldn't help us. Btw the bar is fairly empty just didn't want to sit at the bar. Don't know how this place stays open other than right next to convention center. Walk past it!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten or had drinks at Ten Penny a handful of times since moving to Pittsburgh a few months ago - even had a great first date here! The menu changes, but always has a wide range of unique and staple choices. The wine and beer selection is great as well, but my favorite part of this place is the atmosphere - it takes me right back to NYC's Lower East Side :-)   The staff has always been great - we even had a glass accidentally get knocked over on our table, but the server was extremely embarrassed and the manager comped one of the entrees from our bill, even though we didn't ask for it or make a stink about the glass.   This is definitely a local favorite and somewhere you can bring friends, family or a hot date to and be sure to have a great time!"}
{"text":"It is a great location & the place looks nice, but I was extremely underwhelmed. It is a shame. It took time for someone to seat me & serve me. The food was just ok at best. I had the giant meatball and truffled fries. They were just ok. If you want good meatballs, go down the street. Not impressed."}
{"text":"My group and I had a wonderful time here before seeing a show!  Tip: Definitely a must to make a reservation if going around show times (applies to most restaurants in the cultural district)  The atmosphere was stellar! We had a great server and bartender- everyone in our group spoke highly of their drinks. I had wine- hard to screw that up, but they had a great selection.  The food was also delicious. I ordered the Shrimp & Scallops Risotto and felt like I was I was in heaven. Such a large portion so make sure you go hungry or can take leftovers. The rest of my group ordered the Mango Salmon, Cheese Ravioli, and Ahi Tuna, and all had great things to say!   Definitely a new favorite to include in our go-to restaurants before musicals!"}
{"text":"Ten Penny is currently my favorite downtown eatery - the way I see it, any place that makes me want to devour a bowl of Brussels sprouts at least deserves that title.  Let me explain. I'd been introduced to Ten Penny for a holiday party and sampler last year, and had wanted to return for a full meal ever since. When I finally did, I was not disappointed. For starters, without a huge party taking over the joint I was able to appreciate just how lovely this place is. There's the bar area up front, with rustic but comfy looking tables further back, plus full booths alongside the windows. The result of the additional decorated shelves and even their roofwork is a pretty trendy looking and comfortable space to eat a meal in.  I can't voice a single complaint about the servers here, either. Our waiter during the meal was fantastic; from the moment we sat down he was there pouring out glasses of water, checking our drinks, and just generally making sure everything was ok. He had nothing to worry about though: everything was MUCH better than ok! Our cocktails - a cucumber and gin mix, plus a Junipear drink - were the perfect way to start dinner, offering a kick of sweet or semi-tart flavor that helped jumpstart our appetites.   Choosing what I wanted was actually incredibly difficult - Ten Penny has a menu built entirely of out delicious ingredients and combinations, which makes you wish you could have a bite of everything. At first I thought I'd stick to the main menu, but after some discussion with our waiter I ended up choosing one of their specials: a flatbread topped high with salmon, white cheddar, onions, peppers, and spinach. So. GOOD! This flatbread practically melted in my mouth with every delicious creamy bite I took. I'm honestly kind of sad that this isn't a main staple, because even if I matched the ingredients and cooked the salmon in the same fashion they did, I know I still wouldn't be able to replicate this perfection in my own oven. Fortunately, from sampling my dining partner's food I know that some of their staples are just as good. Their single meatball appetizer, for example, was an incredibly juicy pile of meaty goodness, topped with marinara sauce that I really can only describe as \"zesty\" and \"tangy\". This really was the sauce that every ad you've ever seen for sauce thought it was selling you. And oh yes: the bowl of Brussels sprouts. Incredibly enough, these may have been my favorite part of the meal. No joke! These are a must-taste, even if you normally hate Brussels sprouts. Trust me, they make these good. Granted, the balsamic glaze, bacon, and blue cheese that they stack onto them may have something to do with just how much I loved them; I can't be sure. ;) But they were by far the biggest and best surprise of the meal.  Honestly, I really can't emphasize how delicious and perfect Ten Penny is. Put simply, I left full, happy, and without a complaint in the world - an admittedly rare state of being for me. So I'm definitely looking forward to my next fabulous meal and experience here!"}
{"text":"Worst meal I ever had and I'm not one to complain. Took 2 hours to get our food and the food was dry and tasted like absolute crap. Idk if it was the waitress or the cook but I will never go back to waste $80 on a meal. I can get better food at Wendy's!"}
{"text":"After several dining  attempts with Ten Penny, my family and I will not be returning. My mother and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch without a reservation and were seated at the bar. It took 15-20 minutes to get the bartenders attention to order cocktails and over an hour to receive our food after we had ordered. Upon receiving our food, the meal I had ordered was delivered without a side option as noted on the menu. I had ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese ($5 up-charge for pulled pork) and found 3-4 SMALL chunks of pulled pork at the bottom of my meal. We had also noticed that several other patrons at the bar had sent food back to the kitchen and had meals comped.  Just recently, had made a reservation for 11 people for a Sunday holiday brunch. Again, the service was slow and inattentive. Again, we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Again, there were clearly many unhappy customers - no one sitting around us had any food! After finally receiving our food it was clear that it had been sitting under warmers for an extended period of time, as poached eggs were now hard boiled and eggs in omelets were hard with cold centers.  On a side note, my mother in law had contacted the managers several times to book a private room for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding - phone calls and emails were never returned!  Overall, poor experience, poor service, poor food. Would not recommend. Such a shame for a restaurant with such a great downtown location and creative space."}
{"text":"Totally cool place.  Got the whole black metal and dark wood theme going on.  Hip  barkeeps, good looking waitresses, hot front desk girls, look to get inside and watch people who want to be seen at this place. Food is secondary to the social scene.  None of us had anything poor but none of us had anything outstanding."}
{"text":"I and my sons just wandered in for a late dinner so I had no expectations nor did I read any reviews before entering. The result was that it neither impressed nor disappointed me. Food was decent and came on warm plates. A plus. The kitchen, however, was very slow in getting the meals out although the place was not overly crowded. I had to coach the waitress to ask the kitchen if they could substitute an item in a dish per my sons preference. She wasn't aware restaurants will do something the customer desires and originally denied the change. The kitchen okayed it when she asked. A side dish came out 15 min after our entrees. We got overly charged for the substitution we requested and were granted. We also got charged for a higher price entree we switched from after we made a change from our initial order. We were there too long to make a fuss over a few bucks. Overall it was an average experience. More of a friends gathering place not one I would consider for a memorable dining experience. Rustic wood environment and seating was cordial."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not memorable. Drinks at happy hour were reasonable. Ambiance was lovely but loud. Service was slow but friendly. It wasn't bad. If I was staying at a hotel nearby I would pop in and give it another chance but wouldn't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"The food is okay, not great. Came here with a group of four and no one left satisfied. Service is unbearably slow and rarely on the floor. It took 15 mins just to get the first round of drinks to to the table. When our entrees came out the didn't Clear the empty plates from the appetizers. It was like they were trying to solve a puzzle as to where they should place our sides. They didn't clear the appetizers until they put everything on the table. Oh! Almost forgot, the shared sides didn't come with serving utensils and the didn't give us new dining utensils with the entrees. Were we supposed to use our personal dirty utensils????  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I haven't had the food yet but I already feel motivated to write a review. Walked up to the bar for a quiet meal by myself while traveling for work right after two men did. The waitress didn't even look at me and I waited without a menu or as much as a hello for over 5 minutes before I walked over to where four waitresses were gathered to plead for some service. I'm looking around me and the businessmen around me at the bar are immediately greeted and given normal expected service. I had to flag another waitress down to give my order and she didn't take my menu or tell me about the wine specials, which I would have taken advantage of if this whole experience turned out better. This is the worst service I've received so far and I can't help but feel discriminated as the only Asian or even minority woman in the restaurant trying to just have a quiet decent dinner while everyone around me is acknowledged and served immediately. Can't wait for the food."}
{"text":"Some people only write reviews when the place is spectacular but I honestly more often than not like writing the ones that are a bit more um...not spectacular. Menu was small and nothing jumped out as special. The decor was pretty industrial and bland. Would not recommend as far as the brunch menu is concerned. Service was nice however and bathrooms were clean but those are the only positives. This place is more like 2 penny...I'll see myself out :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend. We ate outside to enjoy the weather. My pinot grigio wine was very good. I has a salmon dinner and my friend had a pasta dinner. Both were great tasting . The prices were very reasonable and the service was excellent. This was the second time eating there. The first time was for a  business lunch and everyone enjoyed the food and service. Will return."}
{"text":"Who runs this place? Why did so many servers, workers, etc lie to us and say the hostess will be right with us? Why was our service so excruciatingly slow when I counted approx 5 billion people working here and a 2/3 empty restaurant? Why was the food so not tasty yet so expensive? Why did the waitress never refill my cold thimble of coffee after she said she would? These are questions that will never have answers because I will never ever ever ever ever ever eat here again."}
{"text":"We went here for the Yelp's 10 Days to the Holidays party and really enjoyed the place.  It's what you would expect in downtown- upscale and classy, decorated very nicely like an old warehouse, and extra decorations all around for the holidays.  They were serving several 'small plates' appetizers but the smoked salmon pinwheels were my favorite.  We also had jalapeño poppers and crab balls which were mediocre at best.  Our bartender, Tony, told us that the food wasn't from their menu so they were probably 'feeling out' a new supplier.  The poppers were full of some sort of stuffing with a very mild, very limp pepper inside.  To me- poppers should have a little 'kick' at least at the end to let you know you're eating jalapeños.    The crab balls were full of stuffing with a little crab flavor but on inspection, I could not see any actual crab inside.  Again- these were not on the regular menu so I'm giving Ten Penny a 'Pass'.  A table next to us, not involved with Yelp, was eating from the Ten Penny Hot Stone selections where a very hot stone like griddle is delivered to the table and raw selections of beef, chicken, shrimp & tofu can be ordered to cook it yourself, teppanyaki style, and eaten with seaweed salad and other accompaniments.  My wife couldn't stop watching- giving me a 'play-by-play' as these 2 women enjoyed their 'Hot Rocks'.  I think we'll have to come back just to try this dish.   Thank you Ten Penny for supplying the space for Yelp, we are now 'Fans'..."}
{"text":"We showed up 20 minutes before close. We were told that they would prefer not to have our business because there were too many people."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and the service is painfully slow. I'm willing to forgive a slow kitchen, but the wait staff is also slow with the drink orders and bringing a requested check. They are still slow when the restaurant isn't busy.  It's not a good place for a workday lunch HOUR because of the service.  It's a shame because they have a great space, especially when they open the sides during warm weather.  The food is decent. We would eat here more often if he service was better."}
{"text":"Took friends here before a Pirates game. Good food, fast service and a fun atmosphere. Nice, casual place."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Had high hopes here. Service was frenetic. Had to remind staff that we needed a menu.   Drinks, small and weak.   Food: we had crispy Brussels sprouts: soggy and cold.   Caesar salad for dinner: they present it as two full heads of romaine. Heart stem and all. Drizzled with dressing. Cute concept but impractical. We did the kitchens work of chopping the salad on a plate too small for the size, needed to request additional dressing. Salty fried pancetta and two tiny croutons. Classic salad gone wrong.   Great location. Still.....the kitchen and bar need to step it up to compete in our foodie market."}
{"text":"Right in downtown, spacious floor plan with comfortable seating. Service and food were great! Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I visited Ten Penny for drinks & dinner with girlfriends about a year ago and decided to give it another shot last night with my boyfriend. We were going to a show at the Byham and it was one of the first beautiful nights in Pittsburgh this Spring, so basically everywhere downtown was busy. We ended up making reservations on Open Table about 30 minutes before arriving & it looked like we got one of the last reservations because everyone else was being turned away when we arrived.   I remember having a pleasant experience last time I went, nothing that exactly stood out but the food & service was good. Last night was the same. I love the atmosphere inside of Ten Penny, it has the industrial chic look that is popping up everywhere in Pgh, but it's cool & neat to look at. And since it was nice out, they had all the windows open which I love! Our waitress was very attentive & was also very helpful when we asked questions on the menu. Despite how busy she was, she took the time out to explain the specials & answer the questions we had.  Chris & I actually ended up getting the same meal last night. We both got the salmon entree. It has a molasses glaze & pineapple salsa on top. I honestly LOVED this meal! The salmon was cooked to perfection, the glaze was unique and unlike anything I've ever had & I was obsessed with the pineapple salsa on top. Perfect & light meal! The sides are \"family style\" (but they actually aren't that big), so we shared the whipped mashed potatoes & the asparagus. The mashed potatoes were delicious & the asparagus was pretty good but had butter sauce on top that I wasn't overly excited about.  Overall, Ten Penny is always crowded when I go past, the atmosphere is cool and the food is pretty good. I'm sure it will continue to do well in downtown Pittsburgh. There are a lot of other places I would go over Ten Penny but it's always a great option for a good meal and nice night out."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Still sitting here 20 minutes later waiting for our server to bring our bill. Service is EXTREMELY slow. Calamari was skimpy and hardly any squid, just fried panko crust. Drinks were  weak and not craft. Went downhill recently. Too many other great places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"Very nice and relaxing space for drinks during happy hour or for eating in with friends. It's one of the more casual places on Penn Ave in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, a little too loud.. Loved the place, will return  Server was friendly, attentive and had great suggestions. Brussels sprouts as an appetizer were DELICIOUS. Came here for my sons 25 birthday. 2 of us got the Risotto, 1 got duck, 1 mushroom ravioli. Biggest complaint was there was too much food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I take my family there every time we're in town and have had great experiences. The chicken and waffles is one of my favorite dishes. Quality food, great crowd, the staff is exceptional and they have a great late night spot downstairs (Penn Society) for after hours! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been in Pittsburgh for about a year and this is hands down my favorite place after my first time visiting last night.   The food itself was absolutely delicious, but can only speak for the appetizers and soups as our party opted to order a bunch of their sharables and appetizers, so I have not had an entree tasting.  The brussel sprouts, special flatbread, and mac n cheese were delicious and had a unique mix of flavors, but the Mushroom flatbread was absolutely delicious, probably the most tasty thing I've had in the city since my meal at Meat N Potatoes.  The service, at first the service was a bit aggressive, we were constantly asked if we were ready to order entrees despite making it clear we were going to order a bunch of sharables, but the lady was nice overall, just very attentive to a fault.   The kitchen did forget our soups at one point, which honestly wasnt a big deal at all as the soup was worth the wait, it was light, creamy, and absolutely delicious (Cream of Asparagus), despite our party really being fine with the small mistake and not caring, the management took care of us and were very apologetic for what we viewed as a something not even major.  5 star service and food, will def be back and sharing with out of towners."}
{"text":"So I've been dying to try this restaurant since I moved to Pittsburgh.  I heard a few random people raving about the delicious food, great happy hour, and quality wait staff. So I finally had a night where I could get downtown without \"rush hour\" giving me grief.   I called my best friend and asked him to accompany me. It's always a good idea to have someone in your circle who is as honest as you are, eats as much as you, and can toss a few back as well.   We sat towards the back of the restaurant at a table for two as all booths were currently occupied. Our waitress was phenomenal and I recall what she looks like but her name is escaping me. She gave great suggestions for us first-timers, ordered us another round before happy hour was over, and told us to come back for dessert.  We started off we the calamari. I didn't care for one of the sauces, but the calamari itself was delicious and crispy.  Then for our I ordered the Clam and Shrimp Pasta and he ordered the Seared Shrimp and Scallpp Risotto.  My mouth watered with every bit.  We were so stuffed and happy that we went out for cocktails after.  Compliments were given to the chef because he/she did not disappont.   My stomach applauds Ten Penny, our waitress,  and the kitchen staff !"}
{"text":"I'm updating from my recent visit for lunch. Stopped in on Thursday. Seated easily as it was heading into the Easter holiday. Our service was excellent.  I had the grilled cheese (added bacon) and tomato soup. The soup was soooo good. I had a 9 oz pour of Chardonnay (I was on vacay!) with my lunch and totaled to $23. A little high for lunch, but not terrible and I took half the sandwich home.  My friends had crabcake sandwich and pulled pork flatbread. We all had to-go boxes.   Where my previous experiences had been so-so, I'm happy to say the food was really good and service excellent. I'll be back now!"}
{"text":"Great Service, excellent server. Food was very good, my omelette was one of the 10 best I had so far. Would definitely recommend for breakfast / brunch."}
{"text":"Me and my family came down from New York.  Thought we would have a better chance at finding some place decent in Down town PA the in Elwood City when we arrived went to this place because for some reason people think this place was Cheap giving it a $$ rating for cheap if your looking for a cheap decent place to go this is not the place and they don't have much of a verity to choose from.  I just ended up getting the mega meatball wasn't amazing the sauce for it was very good. The best thing to eat here are there regular French fries I would only recommend this place for appetizers.  And the service was really good it's a nice atmosphere just need to change the menu a little bit and come down in the prices."}
{"text":"I got the Ten P burger and it was great. All of the flavors came together for a really good lunch option, the slaw was okay, it was a little different but sometimes different is good. My problem, as with most of my reviews, is with the beer. I was finally able to get one on my fourth try. It took the bartender quite a while to come over to me and the bar was not busy. At all, around 4 people aside from me. I'm an IPA guy so asked for the Lagunitas, was told it was kicked along with the next two I asked for (I think Fat Heads Head Hunter and Bell's Two Hearted). When I asked, she said that there was a big party the night before and that they just hadn't been changed. Which is upsetting. It was after noon the next day, it's not hard to change a keg.  Food was very good. Service was okay. Management was questionable."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was not great. Wanted to order flatbreads but when we ordered, we were told the flatbread machine was broken. Our waiter told us that everyone was told at the door- we weren't. Our waiter didn't check on us during the meal- we had to wave him down in order to get a drink. And we also ordered an appetizer that never came. The restaurant wasn't crowded at this point either. Menu is fairly priced and food was good. I ordered the appetizer Mac and Cheese as my meal. It is very heavy and filling, so I had enough for leftovers, but it was delicious! Everyone in my party had good things to say about the food, we just wished the service was a bit better!"}
{"text":"Menu and atmosphere are great. Good menu did not translate into good food.  Everything was awful.  Beignets were raw.  Sliders were dry and tasteless.  Deviled eggs were pure mustard. Took almost 1 hr to get any form of food.  I asked for a manager and he didn't bother to come to the table.  Just took a few items off the bill.  I felt bad for the waitress.  Not her fault."}
{"text":"Updating to a one star.  One of the managers contacted me and apologized stating they'd send me a gift card.  I don't really like to go back to places that had such poor service but figured it was a nice gesture and would give it another shot.  I replied w my address and never heard back. This was well over a month ago ... Poor customer service all around!      One of the hostesses was extremely rude (her name was Janet or Janice unclear).  After being seated at a table, she came over and kicked us out claiming a reservation was here to sit there and kept literally rolling her eyes at us.  We got up and moved and then no one filled that seat.   One of the people in our party questioned 15 minutes later why the table was still empty and she got very confrontational with him.  She literally got into an argument and semi-screaming match.  Very poor customer service.  The waitress, Erin, was very sweet but we didn't order food because we just wanted to finish our drinks and leave!"}
{"text":"I am between 3 and 4 stars-service and ambience are a 4 or even a 5. Carrot cake pancakes, breakfast flatbread and apple french toast are all 4 (would be a 5 if a but more generous portions). Skillets need some work-dry toast and dry potatoes. Keilbasa was awesome but chicken apple sausage was dry enough to be inedible (and certainly not anything resembling sausage)! Add some hollendaise sauce and those skillets are punched up to a 4 or even a 5. Clean and lovely xmas decor!"}
{"text":"I used to work around the corner and wanted to love this place. It's a good atmosphere for drinks and the occasional appetizer. However, the food is just okay. Ive done dinner and brunch here on a couple of occasions and it was hit or miss. The service at the bar was good, but sit-down service was slow. I'd go back for drinks but probably not a meal."}
{"text":"We were here on business and found TenPenny online.  How lucky did we get???  Fantastic place, and great food.  But the best were the two guys behind the bar.  Curtis and Schaffer went above and beyond what most bartenders ever offer.  They made our night. Very friendly, funny, helpful and just fun guys.  Such a enjoyable night. We will be back for sure when here on business.  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Was there with a friend for lunch today. Shared the locally sourced charcuterie platter. Amazing selection of yumminess. Then a bowl of incredible loaded potato soup and a cobb salad. Truly memorable. Our waiter, Pickle, was so nice and interesting and knowledgeable. The GM, Lindsey, came by to visit as well then after lunch took us downstairs to the private club speakeasy. The ambiance of the whole restaurant is superb. We're inviting other friends to join us there Saturday night for the speakeasy experience. Private club that's open to the public, so they're open until 3:30am!!! Can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start with: I have worked in a restaurant and have for 15 years.  I get it.  I understand it.  There will be some glitches.  I have given Ten Penny 3 chances.  I went to TP within weeks of its Grand Opening.  The service was great, the food was great.  Overall, a great experience.    Strike 1:  My boyfriend and I went to TP for an early dinner (around 5 pm, empty restaurant) on a Saturday night a few months ago.  The service was horrendous.  Every few minutes, a new employee would come over and ask if we needed any thing.  One would come up and ask for drinks, when we already had them on the table, then some one just took our menus before we ordered.  About 4 or 5 people, including server assistants and random servers came to our table over the course of our meal.  (FYI, food was under average and cold) No steps of service and I had no idea who my server was until the end when a server (not a manager) came up and said \"Sorry, I know that this was a little crazy, we had to let some one go right before this shift\".  I don't know how she thought that would make everything OK.  In the end we paid and tipped appropriately, but left with a  bad taste in our mouths.  Strike 2 and 3:  Last Sunday I went to brunch and was going to give TP another chance.  The reservation was originally made for 7 @ 10 am and then when we needed to add a few more, we were told, \"We could squeeze that in\".  The place was empty.  Our food came out in a timely manner, but one item never came out (but when it did come out, my friend said it was delicious) and I bit into my chicken sausage only to have the wrapper of the sausage in my meal.  Sorry, strike 2 and 3.  I tried.  I really did.  I like the décor, the location, but I just can't give it a perfect 10."}
{"text":"Despite the possible Yelp ranking admonitions against it, I chose this place for its ease of reservation on Open Table, it's proximity to the theater and it's wide array of menu options( (side bar: there are a couple great appetizers (both the Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes received high marks) but I wouldn't recommend this place, in general for vegetarians). Now the burger special, it was bonafide delicious, no way around it, this was a seasonal option that included beef, bacon, gravy, a potato patty and a pretzel bun.... yum. The meatball flatbread was also quite tasty though it'll be too soft for some. The southern fried chicken salad was a great portion, and also relatively close to phenomenal. The potato soup didn't quite make history and came out cold, the coffee followed suit at lukewarm. It took forever to get silverware and we finished our appetizer before we got the promised plates. Follow up was necessary for any sort of refills and the dessert took so long it was like they were picking the apples fresh for the cobbler. The service was as friendly as it was slow, and it was very friendly. I would be very unlikely to return, probably best to spend your downtown dollars elsewhere since this place is also not cheap. It's unfortunate but whatever you do don't follow the menu, follow the reviews."}
{"text":"Food-good. Atmosphere-fun. Service-Awful! A restaurant should not rely solely on location to bring in the customers. Service goes a long way in bringing customers back. We won't be. And we really did have high hopes for it!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles. Ordered the grilled chicken that was not on menu. The grilled chicken was good. The waffles not so much. The waffles had pepper or some kind of spice in the waffles that ruined them. Decor is cool and cozy. Chairs are hard with no cushions."}
{"text":"The noise is deafening. You can't hear the person across the table from you. Food took 30 minutes to get to table. Menu has a lot of room for improvement. The employees lack etiquette. They are rude and would be better suited to a skateboard shop. Went down the street to Red Beard to get food after we left."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just ok. To be fair we came when they were still serving their late lunch menu. The decor is pretty awesome, really liked the more industrial feel.   Due to the limited menu the only appetizer that sounded good to me was the cheese plate. It was okay. Expensive for what it was. I liked he honey but didn't understand why the crackers were drizzled in it too. Overall it was just a bunch of thin cheese slices, berries, and honey thrown on the plate for 12 bucks. It also took about 15 minutes for it to get to the table. The restaurant was empty and it's not like any cooking was involved so this didn't really make sense to me...I also thought our waiter really seemed like he did not want to be there at all. Maybe true, but it didn't help the experience much.  Overall, not sure I'd rush back here...  Hubby and I got salads, both of which were very good"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday at lunch time to kill some time. I was alone and wanted to try someplace new so I sat at the bar.   I figured it would have been a little busier for the day and time, but there was plenty of bar seating.   The hostess was VERY friendly. a tad over whelming in the friendly department, but you don't see that much no a days any way so good for her.   Anyways, I sat at the bar and the bar tender was friendly and prompt.   For lunch I got the Portobello Sandwich with fries. IT WAS PERFECT!! I loved it. The fries were cooked at perfect crispiness. I cant wait to come back with friends and try all the apps, especially the truffle fries."}
{"text":"I was sitting in a party of 9. We each had a different meal. Each dish was perfect and pleased each diner. Most of us shared, trying several of the dishes. There were no complaints. We had the hot peanut butter chocolate chip cookie with chocolate ice cream and the aroma of that fresh cookie was phenomenal! Definitely a do-again."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and my service was even better on Friday night. Gavin was courteous, prompt, and extraordinary. I would highly recommend this restaurant for the sole purpose of Gavin's service."}
{"text":"This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.  When we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the \"bread basket\"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.    Onto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  \"What's wrong?\"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.  So we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch after visiting the convention center across the way.  The place was not crowded and we were able to get a seat rather quickly.  We were seated at a booth that is two steps up from the main dining area.  The overall space of the place is a nice size.  There are plenty of tables, booths and seats around the bar.  The interior is trendy as my wife stated.  It really is a nice space and the lighting is a little 'lower' to give it a more cozy feel.  Our server was very friendly, prompt, efficient and polite.  He made suggestions based on our asks and his recommendations were spot on.  The drink selection is aplenty.  They have a fully stocked bar, about 15 beers on tap (this is estimated as I forgot to actually count) and ample wine.  They also have a Bloody Mary menu as well, but I opted for a beer as did the other guests in my party.  The brunch menu offered a decent amount of items.  The menu includes, salads, omelets, flatbread pizzas, soups, burgers and some other sandwiches.  I had the Margarita flatbread with pizza.  It was pretty good, nothing exceptional, but still tasty.  My wife had the omelette with home fries and found it to be really good.   I would recommend this place for brunch for sure.  The price is fairly moderate too, so no issues there.  After my experience, I would definitely come back for lunch and or dinner."}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop in at Ten Penny for lunch last Friday. The staff mentioned they have been open for about three months. First off the place is cool looking, large space and a lot of bar seats. High ceilings and the decor is nice. I will be supplying a pic of the beers on tap. Yes, you now know my priorities upon entering a establishment. ;)  Anyway I am in the middle of my lent obligations so I felt compelled to go with a fish sandwich. The menu is not a ideal match for fish but it is a well diversified and good mix on the menu. No doubt I will try a different item during my next stop in.  The fish was pretty large, side of fries along  with a wonderful side of home made Cole slaw. I was charged a extra $1 for a bun and .50 for cheese.  I have since been informed that cheese on fish is \"yucky\". Well I beg to differ...I guess some people don't like to try new things. :) Back to the meal, the presentation was great, good portion, and I liked the tarter/ketchup in portion cups. I did have 3 people stop by to see how my lunch was. That was nice an  done at appropriate times.  Honestly I spent $20 on lunch and that is too much for my budget. So this won't be a regular stop. I can definitely see myself stopping in for a beer or taking my W to dinner here."}
{"text":"First, I loved the space.  It is beautiful.  It's warm and inviting and cozy yet has a real warehouse feel which adds an element of cool.  Loved it!  We ordered cocktails from their cocktail menu.  I ordered one with rum and bourbon which was really bad.  It tasted like cough syrup.  My friend ordered one that was tequila based and it also tasted like a different flavored cough syrup.  Another ordered a grapefruit based vodka drink that was so bitter it tasted like drinking lemon juice.  The only great drink was our fourth which was a prickly Pear Margarita.  The other three were almost undrinkable.  I've been to Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye many times and tired almost all their menu cocktails and never had a bad one.  Their mixes are subtle and delicious.  The same with Bar Marco.  Clearly Ten Penny is trying to offer a similar experience but their mixes are little more than a bunch of booze and mixes thrown together, not  nuanced or perfected but simply made to sound good on the menu.  Not good. We ordered wine from then on.  We ordered two appetizers to share.  We got the truffle fries which were really good and the Brussels sprouts which were very good as well.  The waiter situation was a little odd.  We seemed to have three different waitresses that either swarmed us or abandoned.  We were asked several times within two minutes if we wanted to order entrees and we told them we were not ready.    Then we  waited another 30 minutes before we could flag anyone down to take our order.  We ordered individual glasses of wine which took about a half hour to get and were eventually delivered after we asked a couple of times.  We got our entrees within a reasonable amount of time.  Two of us ordered the Clambake.  Everything in it was shriveled up and dried out.   The clams and mussels were dried out nuggets inside their shells, the shrimp was not \"jumbo\" as advertised but small and dried out, the crawfish were miniature and inedible, and yet the potatoes were undercooked. There was apparently supposed to be sausage in there too but neither of ours had sausage.  The \"garlic toast\" was just two pieces of white bread layered on the top of it all.  No garlic, no butter, and barely toasted, just soggy white bread.  There was a white fish in there too that was so dried out it was difficult to eat and not gag on it.  Our other two diners had pasta dishes that were mediocre.  One ate about half and opted to leave the other half instead of take it home.  Then we waited for quite some time for dishes to be cleared, probably 20 minutes while our three waitresses were elsewhere.  And then all three descended upon us within a couple of minutes asking in staccato  if we wanted dessert.  We ordered a couple of them and the best food of the night was their bourbon walnut torte with vanilla ice cream.  It was delicious.  In summary: GREAT atmosphere, comfortable seating, and the rest needs a LOT of work.  Oh, and for a mediocre experience, we paid $140/per couple.  Definitely far too much money for mediocre."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick drink on a Friday night, following dinner. We were seated immediately and our waitress was attentive and helpful. I ordered a glass of wine and he ordered a White Lightning. We decided to try an appetizer. My husband likes to joke about judging a restaurant by its calamari. Calamari is a very simple ingredient, that if prepared right, tastes amazing. However, if not prepared right, can come off rubbery and ultimately, shows you the finesse of the cooks. So when trying some place new, if they have calamari, we always go for that!  It came out quickly and was hot. There were two dipping sauces, one which was a spicy, garlic, red pepper, and lime clear sauce. The other, was a milder-tasting Carribean aioli that was tasty. However, we were both turned off by the breading on the calamari. It crumbled right off and tasted like corn meal. It was also over-cooked. Bummer. I was curious about what was in the breading, because the texture kept resembling corn meal to me. Our waitress was kind enough to ask the cooks, who confirmed that they recently changed the breading to a cornmeal base. I think the idea is a creative one, but it just missed the mark, taste-wise. I think this breading would have tasted great on say, a corn dog, but I didn't think it quite went with the delicateness of the calamari.   Bathrooms were neat and clean and easy to locate. About $26 for 2 alcoholic drinks and the calamari.   I wish I had been hungrier, because there were lots of items on the menu that looked like fun, such as the hot rocks, and the beer mussels sounded tasty too. I also discovered, after we left, that they have a whole menu dedicated to Bloody Mary's. Not sure if this is a brunch thing or what, but I would love to taste a few of these next time, as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go into the bar last night to have a drink.   I've heard so many good things about Ten Penny.  Sad to say how disappointed I was.   The male bartender didn't bother to wipe the bar when we sat.   The drink he made me was somehow made incorrectly and although he made me a new one it was just as bad.   And in between time, he got several others their drink first.   A manager never came over to check on us, which in most restaurants someone would have and possibly offered to comp a drink or give another one complimentary.    Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place.  Very nice ambience and decor and a large selection of drinks.  The food is nothing extraordinary (typical bar food).  It is certainly a place mainly for getting a drink and hanging out with friends (imo).  Service is also good and polite.  So overall a good choice if you are downtown and looking for a place to get drinks. The only reason I am giving it a three stars and not more is that it is just one of the many similar places in the area."}
{"text":"After attending a trade show at the nearby convention center, I decided to try dinner here.  The food was very average, nothing special.  Very pricy for a not so great experience.  Extremely loud inside.  I had a Ribeye steak with 2 sides and glass of wine for $57.  In my opinion it wasn't worth it.  I didn't think the meat was prime cut.  Capital Grill down the street would have been a much better choice for about the same money.  Would i eat here again?  Probably not!"}
{"text":"I liked Ten Penny, but for the price, I would go to about 10 other places before choosing to come back.  Our service was excellent.  I arrived before my girlfriends on Friday night and was promptly seated.  I didn't catch our waitress's name, but she took really good care of us all night.  I mentioned when she first approached me that I'd had a long week and she mentioned later in the evening \"I know you said you've had a long week...can I refill your vodka diet?\" and I thought that was funny and cute.  We started with the parmesan truffle fries. They were amazing!!  Enough for 4 of us to split.  I tried their loaded baked potato soup (very good but VERY heavy) and also ordered the salmon Caesar salad.  Another in our group ordered the same thing and the other two ordered a salmon dish that came with mashed potatoes.  They loved theirs and I must admit - the bite I tried was very good.  The interior was dimly lit and we were there for a few hours.  It wasn't so crowded which was nice so we could hear each other speak across the table, but after Beer Fest let out, it started to pick up a bit.  I have one major gripe and maybe I'm being petty, but it was honestly just annoying.  As I mentioned, I ordered the Caesar salad and added salmon as my main meal.  It came out on a small plate with two full large romaine hearts topped with dressing, a very large piece of salmon, topped with cheese and large crouton crackers.  Now, I have no problem deconstructing and mixing my salad myself....however the plate was MUCH too small for how much food was on it, let alone having to cut it and mix it with the butter knife I was provided?  I contemplated sending it back because honestly it was just an inconvenient mess.    Salads are pretty when they are in full form and the flavor was good, plus it had a very generous portion of salmon, but I just couldn't get past the irritation of having to mess around with it prior to eating.  Next time I will either order something different or request that my salad be cut up for me...no matter how childish I feel."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. Today's experience was sub par and lacking. My drinking glass was very dirty. Some type of dried on \"matter\" which was visible from two blocks away. Then my server APRIL, was not very good. She only came back to ask how everything was after I completed my meal. I asked for my check and, though I should not have been surprised there was no pen included. I then had to get up and ask to borrow a pen from the host and hostess. They (host and hostess) were very nice and professional. Do I recommend this restaurant-yes. Why? Because it is a nice spot and I know that it is well managed. The managers will see my posts and will address the issues."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Our waiter was terrible. He was too busy watching march madness rather than wait on us. He took 15 minutes to get us our drinks. Then when we got our cocktails finally they watered down. Then our food came. The cornbread skillet was good but the chicken sliders were dry and the flatbread we got was just bad. Overall bad experience which is a shame cause my fiancé had been wanting to come here for a while and now left disappointed for asking me to take her there"}
{"text":"Food is average at best and waaaaay overpriced.  Upscale bar food.  Good atmosphere and great location, but but you are going to pay for it."}
{"text":"great creative food. Wait staff needs some polishing. Really enjoyed the brussel sporuts and Korean burger."}
{"text":"On the corner of Tenth and Penn sits one of Pittsburgh's new trendy restaurants - fully equipped with great cocktails, good food and friendly service. Came here for drinks and appetizers before a concert on a Saturday night - the place was busy - but it was just the right amount of crowded that we were looking for.   Very unique atmosphere - open - lots of windows. They make lots of things visible - from their wine cellar, to some pantry items are normally tucked away in the kitchen. Great big open bar in the center and in the back they have gray couch type booths for big groups. They also have a private area with a long dining room style table that I would imagine you could rent out for a party - and of course dinner and high-top bar tables all around, made with beautiful dark wood - butcher block style. It's really a fantastic space.   Fun drinks - but I would not suggest the pickle cocktail - I thought I was just drinking pickle juice - all the other cocktails around the table were delicious though! We got a super fun appetizer. It was called 'Hot Rocks'. They bring you out a really, really, really hot stone for you to cook a selection of proteins that you choose. We got three - tuna, kobe beef, and scallops - they also had shrimp, tofu and portobello mushrooms. They serve you the raw proteins, and you use soy sauce to cook them up on the stone - all they need is a quick sear and you have a delicious, fun, interactive appetizer. Comes with garnishes of mushrooms, seaweed salad and pickled veggies. Definitely something I would get next time I'm in - and I would want to try them all. You pay 6, 16 or 30 dollars - depending on how much cooking you want to do :-) We also ordered a beet salad with watercress, goat cheese, and an absolutely divine vinaigrette - it was fantastic. We were sharing it and the kitchen split it for us - this is always a bonus in my book - especially when they don't nab you with the dreaded split plate fee.   I would love to try dinner here and their brunch menu looks awesome - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We brought a large group in and they were super accommodating! Great prices for such a cool place. Really grateful to the staff there for making our outing such a success."}
{"text":"Continuing the trend, horrible table service. The food is not the issue here. I was there right at 5 and I was seated without a menu. The hostess said that she hadn't gotten them out yet. It feels almost like you are an inconvenience to the staff (the exception is the bar staff, they've always treated me well).  Is it really that difficult to find people who aren't rude and care about their jobs?"}
{"text":"Arrived in Pittsburgh late last Friday night and strolled downtown for a late dinner. Found the Ten Penny by chance. The outside looked inviting and the inside was quite impressive. Very rustic but comfortable surroundings. Our waitress could not have been more friendly and accommodating. Ordered calamari rings for appetizer. I have calamari in practically every restaurant I have visited and feel I'm quite an expert and critical. When they arrived, they looked like large onion rings....but, Oh My God were they tender and delicious! No doubt they were handled properly and marinated in milk....superb! Our entrees were just as delicious....well done, perfect sized portions and delicious! Wine selection was just fine and overall pricing was very reasonable. What a pleasant and relaxing visit and I'd recommend anyone visiting Pittsburgh to give this place a try. The couches we sat at were a neat touch, but a little uncomfortable with tilted seat cushions, but hardly enough to ruin an overall great experience! Great job and best of luck to Ten Penny!  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g53449-d6106981-r358008828-Ten_Penny-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html#"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Saturday night...drop by and place seems cool. Several open tables , bar full , TVs have some college games on.  Young lady at the front appeared to be interested in being anywhere except for at Ten Penny. She informed us that it would be about 40 minutes until we would be seated. We waited outside while we watched the same scene be repeated over and over again, while the same 18 seats sat empty. Once seated, our waitress ( only positive part of the  experience ) was great...working hard , but the kitchen was over whelmed, and under prepared. After waiting 20 minutes for appetizers, ( and 40 minutes) for the table....the tables around us STILL sat empty.  During the entire experience, several groups were brushed off , and sent on their way....while the tables sat vacant. Crazy idea...hire great people...fill your tables...and thank people for their business. Only reason this place got any stars at all was our waitress KELLY. She did great with what she was given. She should find a place that respects her and the patrons ."}
{"text":"When here for an early dinner and I thought it was great.  The outside seating was nice especially on this beautiful day.  I ordered the Seafood Red Curry and I loved it.  It was fresh and rich and I only wished that it came with a couple pieces of bread to dip with.  I think the cost was a bit much but, I'm only hear for a week and I would go back hand down again."}
{"text":"This is an update on my previous review. I was given a gift card for an honest review of the establishment after we had three not so great meals. I appreciated the quick contact and offer to try again.   We went on a Saturday night, around the same time and day as our last lack luster meal at Ten Penny. Our service was ten times better on this try. Our waitress was kind, attentive, and checked back in with us often (this had been a problem before, when often we did not see our waiter for 20 or 30 minutes at a time). We ordered the Brussels sprouts again as an appetizer, and they were much more crispy and less covered in sauce this time. I had the roasted pear salad, which was quite enjoyable and fresh. The pear was truly a highlight. My husband had the burger, which he noted was alright but not the best he has ever had. I only ordered wine this meal, and it was expensive but nothing exciting. My husband had the same experience with this beer. So, overall, it was a pleasant experience but nothing extraordinary. We will probably continue to hit up other downtown establishments first, and go to Ten Penny when they are full or we forgot to make a reservation somewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere immediately upon arrival.  It was a short wait to be seated, as we had reservations. The server was promt and friendly. We ordered the meatball appetizer. I order the Filet and my husband ordered the Lemon Sage Tuna. The appetizer came out almost immediately and that made the wait for entrees seem longer. My steak arrived medium well rather than the medium I ordered.  It was very tender and juicy however. The potatoes were just so so and could have been better. The glaze was wonderful . My husband had no complaints about the tuna. We ordered dessert and I mentioned it was the husbands birthday. They brought out his dessert with a candle. I felt that was appropriate for the establishment.  There were a few other things on the menu I would like to try but I won't rush to get back to do it. It was a sound meal with pleasant service and creative surroundings. I expected a tad more from the food."}
{"text":"Very bland food. No flavors. Our table of 10- the salt shaker was a popular item. Service was a bit slow on a not too busy night.   The restaurant is nice and at excellent location. Great ambience."}
{"text":"First let me state I haven't had the food... but that's why I'm writing this review! I live a block from the Ten Penny and on this Saturday night around 8 PM I thought it would be a good time to try out the new place on the block. All the shows in the Cultural District were underway, no crowds, but still prime time dinner time! My party of three walked the block down to Ten Penny looking forward to some culinary delights and some good libations. When we walked in the new place looked great very nicely appointed and upscale the promise continuing to build. Then the sock in the face.... The girl at the front asked if we had a reservation. I politely said no but we live on the street and wanted to grab a bite at the new spot. This is why I'm writing this review...... she proceeds to say there is no seating in the dinning room available without a reservation as I count TEN empty tables without ANYONE waiting to be seated at the door!!!! Then to add insult to confusion she proceeds to tell us we can go to the bar and maybe find a seat.... well it's pretty hard for me to see open tables set for service, no one waiting to be seated then be told they are booked and can't seat me and two others! Little advice if you require reservations put it out online, on Yelp and post a sign then I wouldn't be offended when I get there and count TEN places we could have been seated. Also if management reviews this posting know this I went to another restaurant on the same street and racked up a sizable tab which could have been yours... Three main entrees, one appetizer, three glasses of wine, two mixed drinks with top shelf spirits, and three desserts... you do the math! Oh not to mention your hostess rolling her eyes at me for showing up without a reservation and then snidely dismissing me to the bar for a good luck getting a seat and a meal.  A word of advice, being the new kid on the block, before you can be an exclusive establishment where everyone needs a reservation to get a table...... first you have to build that reputation with strong reviews praising your food, spirits, and atmosphere not turning away dinners who are willing to try you out and take a risk!  SO with that off my chest I'm very disappointed with this new kid on the block!"}
{"text":"The dish that saved the experience was the filet mignon. It was truly one of the best prepared steak I have had in a while, definitely flavorful. The dishes experiment with flavor combinations that are great ideas need a little bit more tinkering for perfection.   Example: The rave of the crispy brussel sprouts where the balsamic glazing is a tad too sweet trying to offset the bacon and blue cheese, the mixed salad is literally lettuce draped in olive oil, no vinegar offset; and mega meetball, while good (sauce is fabulous) doesn't have much to compliment with the actual meet.   I must give my compliments to the waiter we had, he was excellent, just enough attention and marketing delivery (after all they bottle their own complimentary water - this means they put the tap water in a bottle before they put it on the table; lol)  The decor is unique yet well replicated in pittsburgh, the layout is a more spaced out splice between industry in lawrenceville and a williams and sonoma shelving emsemble.  I did enjoy myself, yet my companions would would like to see actual corn on the cob in the american clam bake rather than just little nibblets.  All in all another typical Ampd group production but good to check out for the new restauraunt scene."}
{"text":"The food (calamari, gumbo, steak salad, catfish, chicken and waffles) was all fair.  Drinks were a little less so, and the service was awful."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!! I had the crabcake which was moist and came with a delicious red pepper coulis. The blue corn muffins they provided while you waited for your meal was fabulous! The atmosphere was very trendy but had a cool industrial edge to it. The dessert menu looked heavenly, but I was here for lunch so opted out of dessert.  Definitely will be back to try the desserts and their awesome drink menu!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to dinner here after work on a Friday night. We had the best service with the dining room being filled, our server Calvin was always attendant  making sure we were the most hydrated with their fresh filtered watered served to us in a glass bottle. I would take a tinder date here ;)."}
{"text":"I started my meal with tomato basil bisque. The soup was very flavorful but not strong in tomato flavor like I enjoy. For my main course I had Porcini Mascarpone Ravioli. The pasta was very thin and did not hold together well. Overall the seasoning and sauce were very good but strong in garlic flavor.   My husband started his meal with a mixed greens salad. The presentation was very artistic and the vegetables very fresh. For his main course he had Crab-Crusted Flounder and jalapeño cheddar grits. The flounder was light and flakey and the crab melted in your mouth. The grits were very cheesy and not spicy. The only negative is that you got just fish and a side dish had to be ordered separate.   Our dining experience was good and everyone was friendly.  However, the waitress was not attentive. She took our orders and served our drinks but did not serve our food. Then she never checked back once the guy bought our food. Furthermore,  I did not care for the prices. This seemed to have the appearance of a industrial casual type setting with a bar in the center.  The prices did not reflect that."}
{"text":"With the same company that owns local, steel cactus, diesel etc I should have known the service was going to be terrible. Our waiter appeared to be on drugs. Zero knowledge of any happy hour specials that resulted in us to grab a bar tender for information. There was 8 of us, so as a \"larger party\" I can understand some difficulty in regards to splitting checks. However, he decided to assign us all a seat number by counting out loud and pointing---I was ready for a game of duck duck goose to follow. The incoherency continued well into the evening.   Overall the food was decent. Overpriced for appetizers but the decor and atmosphere was a plus. Bathrooms were clean which is always good in my book. For a downtown location the service should have been far better. Wouldn't run back there in a hurry."}
{"text":"I have to say the first time I went here I was no impressed with food or service.  However, it was the first two months it was open and they had a lot of kinks to work out.  I have gone here three times now and it keeps improving,  I had an amazing dinner at Ten Penny during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and this was going to be the last time going here if I got bad service and food again.  I am hooked now and love this place,  I am so glad I gave this place three chances and it is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!!!!!  However, service was still some what slow but worth the wait for the great cherry marinated stuffer pork loin!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for an out of towner. Open atmosphere. The ambiance of a bar, the menu of a restaurant and the location perfect for local hotels. The staff friendly, attentive and accommodating.   I had the Mediterranean flatbread.   Wow.  Perfect for appetizer or meal.   Multitude of beer to choose from. (Too many in fact). But definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Usually, as a rule, I would never set foot inside of a place that has \"Ten\" or \"Penny\" in it's name(I was raised in a very strict household) but as the \"gods\" had fated me my \"Tinder\" date insisted that we go to this particular establishment. I did not want to scare them off with my general distaste of establishments with either of those words in the name so I kindly obliged them. I had made it very apparent to them that I was not looking for a romantic relationship and I planned on paying for everything though as the night would go on they seemed to forget about that.  I have what some doctor's have called a \"super-liver\" which means that I can drink alcohol in much higher quantities than they average human or even sub-human. The highlight of this experience was their wine list which I moved through quite easily. My \"date\" had a a glass out of each of the bottles that I drank and appeared to be slightly \"toasted\" quite quickly. As for food I had the \"Mixed Greens\" salad style entree and the \"Roasted Jumbo Asparagus\" as well. I found both of these to taste nearly exactly as I had always read they would.   Our human service person showed us great attention and will surely be on their way to bigger and better things soon.  My date however did not keep their cool very well and I had to send them home in a \"LYFT\" style transport vehicle as I did not feel comfortable giving them a ride myself. I wouldn't say I am saving myself for marriage but I am not the Desertron particle accelerator some people in our society are."}
{"text":"Checked out Ten Penny for the first time this weekend and it was surprisingly a nice atmosphere.  I can't comment on the food, as we only were there for dessert and drinks, but our bar experience was above average.   The bar staff was very friendly and quickly attentive from the time we sat down. I ordered a TP No. 1 Cup which was delicious and my friend ordered a traditional Cosmo martini. We were both happy with our choices.   We then had heard about their S'mores dessert and ordered that. The homemade graham crackers, homemade marshmallows and Hershey's bar was amazing. We roasted the marshmallows (raspberry, vanilla and chocolate/jalapeno) and made our own s'mores. It was worth every bite.   The only thing that was confusing was their valet service. It was snowing pretty bad so we opted for valet. It said \"$10 valet or $7 with validation inside.\" When we cashed out we got $3 off what we thought was the valet. When we got outside we gave the $9 - $7 + a $2 tip. He thens knocks on my window and says \"You owe me $10\". We were both confused because we said we got it validated inside and we thought it was $7. He then explained that valet is always $10, and you just get $3 off your tab inside like a \"coupon\" off your tab. It still didn't make sense to us but we ended up giving him $12 before he allowed us to drive away. Next time - I probably wouldn't valet but I'd go back and try dinner for sure."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch with 5 people and there was no problem finding a table.  The decor was the usual industrial with old equipment used as tables. Not very original, but well done.  Too bad they did not carry the theme through to the bathrooms. I was expecting a bucket and a steam pipe, but it was a simple bathroom.  The burger I had was ginormous and very tasty. Three of us ordered the same thing and we all enjoyed our meals.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.    Will go back, but want to try the other places along Penn before that."}
{"text":"The five star rating is only for the server Joe.  We went to the restaurant during a lunch break while attending a convention across the street from the restaurant.  The place was bombarded with people all going in at the same time.  Joe was attending to several tables and all those seated at the bar.  He moved fast and was extremely pleasant.  We ate here before and the server we had moved so slow, not a care in the world.  Joe made the lunch experience pleasant while respecting our time limits.  Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and location are great, the menu in theory sounds mouthwatering delicious, but in reality it is bland, tasteless and served by mediocre staff. We waited nearly 40+ minutes in a less than half filled restaurant for our meals. Our server rarely stopped by our table, charged us for each soda refill and double charged us for two bar drinks. When we pointed out that we only got two bar drinks and not four and questioned why we were charged for soda refills there was no apology from our waitress, just a quick \"I'll fix it\" and she walked away. Although there is no way to know for sure, it felt like she was inflating our tab without us noticing in hopes of securing a bigger tip judging by the way she reacted to the whole incident. Our mac and cheese tasted like nothing. I felt like I was eating plain noodles. The chicken and waffles were so-so. The only saving grace was that we enjoyed our Brussels sprouts appetizer. There are way too many good places to eat in this part of town. Don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"The menu says happy hour 9-11 and we came on a Saturday, asked if it applied today was told yes, then after ordering drinks and apps that it doesn't apply on saturdays. It should say on the menu or our server should be made aware. Food was great! And so were our drinks and service."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place. Came down at 6:40 to eat before an 8:00 show. Placed our food order shortly before 7:00 At 7:25 I asked the waitress to check on our meals, at 7:50 I finally tracked her down and said to cancel the order. I realize it was not her fault but checking on the food or being proactive would have went a long way with us. She was never apologetic, nor was a manager notified. Nothing was comped. I don't care about getting free French fries. It was about the gesture and attempting to make it right. The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because the appetizer we had was good, but the experience left an awful taste in my mouth and I will never go back. It's a shame because the atmosphere gave me high hopes. One more thing. We sat in a booth , and the cushion was so beat up, stretched out, and crooked I constantly felt like I was falling out of the seat. With so much other high level competition within steps of this place no need to return."}
{"text":"Had drinks here Friday night before heading out and the bartender was awesome.  Came back for Brunch on Sunday (from her recommendation) before leaving town.  The Bloody Marys are delicious!  Housemade Bloody Mary mix with a little kick.  The breakfast pizza was savory and the perfect amount for one person.  It had a thin sausage gravy as the base, then topped with bacon and crispy hash browns with a beautiful, fried egg on top.  Love the decor and seating at this restaurant.  After the restaurant closes at 2AM, they have a lounge downstairs that stays open until 3AM. Awesome drinks down there.  Everyone that worked there was really friendly and helpful.  Even pointed us to several other places to check out."}
{"text":"If you come here, there's a chance your food will be wrong.  The food has been on a steady decline since they opened.  The Brussels sprouts are constantly overlooked. My burger was delivered to me tonight in a bun soaked with blood, I did not order rare.  Pittsburgh is going through a food revolution, there are so many amazing choices here now. Do not waste your time coming here.   ****Update****  Great news. There have been some changes to the menu, brunch is awesome here now and more.  I was encouraged to come back and take a look at the changes and I'm so pleasantly surprised. The food was good, our service was the best it has ever been and we left happy!!  I will be going back again this weekend."}
{"text":"The draft list is great and the service and ambiance are both excellent but I was really disappointed in the food. Maybe I went on an off night, but it was not very good at all. I got the stuffed pepper soup and the mega meatball and they were both very under-seasoned and essentially flavorless. Everyone at the table ordered different things and we all agreed that the food was a letdown. We left feeling hungry and sad. I had heard good things so hopefully it will be better if I return.  UPDATE: I have returned twice and found the food to be better both times so I bumped the score up."}
{"text":"After attending the Yelp holidays party at Ten Penny, I was intrigued to try out a full meal. When left with my choice for lady's brunch, I quickly chose Ten Penny. We made reservations but, upon arrival, noticed that about half of the tables were empty. We ordered our drinks and settled into the soft booth. After checking out the menu, I noticed that there were tons of hearty brunch options (eggs, salads, meats) but very limited options for the sweet bruncher. My suggestion is to add a specialty french toast or waffle. I went with the carrot cake pancakes and added a side of bacon (which was only $2!). Our entrees arrived in an appropriate amount of time. My overall impression was that the food seemed a bit undercooked. The bacon was a little chewy. The pancakes were very heavy  with the consistency of cake batter in the middle. I couldn't determine if this was intentional or not. Either way, it did not make for a light and fluffy pancake as expected. One of my dining companions ordered soup and a steak salad. She was very happy with her meal. When we were finished, the waitress asked if we wanted dessert. I inquired about the oh so yummy chocolate truffles we were able to try at the Yelp event. I was hopeful to take them home with me and add them to the dessert platter for our family dinner with the in laws a few days later. The good news- they were available. The bad news- my favorite flavor, mint, had been replaced by a chocolate with goat cheese. What a disappointment. Apparently the flavors change weekly. I decided to pass. Overall, there were a few things I loved about my experience at Ten Penny and a few I did not."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really enjoyed my first visit to Ten Penny.   Reserving a table through their website was quick and simple, and even when I had to go back and add another person to the reservation I didn't have any issues.  First off, the atmosphere is awesome. The whole restaurant has a very relaxed vibe to it, and I enjoyed the fact that you could see everything outside through the large windows surrounding the room. The only thing I will say is not to go if you need a nap due to the dim lighting, and the seats for the booth tables were so soft you sank into them and felt like a kid at the adult table.   The food was fantastic. I got their Stuffed Chicken breast, and a shared order of the mussels. Both of which I thought were perfect.   One of my favorite things however were their cocktails. I only tried their Pricky Pear Margarita, but everything on the menu sounded really interesting, so I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Service is meh. Took us a long time to even get the drink menu when we were sitting at the bar. It wasn't even peak time. Did not have food here so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"biggest disappointment i can remember. we had an 8:30 reservation on a friday night. server took nearly 10 mins to get our drink order (party of 4) and another 15 until they arrived. add another 15 to get a question answered regarding an ingredient in one of the appetizers. she did not write down our order and had to come back and ask us to repeat it.  when we did receive our food - all small plates - it was fine with the exception of one dish which was burnt. we would have asked for a replacement but we never saw the server again until we were nearly finished. she removed one diners plate while the person was still eating.  to top it all off at the end of the meal the server came back to ask us to explain her tip which she apparently felt was insufficient. decent food but deplorable service. never going back."}
{"text":"Didnt have a great experience here. My friends and I ordered the Ten Pen hash and the eggs were not fully cooked. Got a discount for it. Overall, would suggest going to another place for brunch"}
{"text":"We stopped by Ten Penny on Saturday night for dinner and the service was pretty terrible.  We did not have a reservation but the hostess was quite accommodating and pleasant. Because there was a small wait we went to the bar to grab a drink. Service was SLOW. Once our table was ready we tried to flag down the bartender and he refused to attend to us despite not being busy or making other people's drinks. We were trying to close our tab but he seemed in no hurry to assist us so we left and went to our table.   Once we sat down our server was clearly over worked and frantic. Service was again slow. Our first course (calamari) came out and was cold. Now I don't normally complain about the temperature of food, and calamari isn't something I expect to be steaming hot, but this was cold, like it had been sitting out for an extended period of time before being served. Once we started eating I realized we didn't have any napkins or silverware. I politely asked another server if she could grab us some since our server was no where to be found and she responded so rudely and said \"yea I'm looking for some for a ton of other people\". While this might be true, no need for the sass and no need to tell a paying customer that you can't find sliver wear. Just tell me you're going to go find some.   Once our dinner arrived my mom's meal was completely wrong. She ordered a salad and the pork belly sliders and the salad never came and the pork belly sliders were chicken. When we told the server about the pork not actually being pork she apologized and asked if she could get us new ones and that she would take the sliders off the bill. The sliders were so poorly done my mom couldn't even eat them. Luckily her salad finally came and she was able to eat that.  The most shocking part, however, came about 45 minutes after we had commented on the sliders and we were getting ready to pay. The server came up to our table and explained that she had talked to the kitchen and the sliders were in fact pork. She then kept the sliders on the bill. Regardless of what meat the sliders were, they were so terrible they could not be eaten. They may have been pork but they certainly were not prepared well and should have been taken off our bill. Additionally, the server never should have come up to us so long after to tell us we were wrong.   During our dinner I watched one table get up and leave because they received no service and another table have so many issues with their bill they had to keep going up to the hostess because the server was no where to be found. I will say that my meal (crab risotto) was delicious and the ambiance is great but I will think twice about returning to Ten Penny because the service really needs some work."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often, but I wanted to write this because I feel like the manager needs to be aware.   This place actually makes me sad- it's amazing decor and vibe- great location and the food was seriously impressive. However- might have been one of the worst experiences with service I've ever had. We got there at 7:20 to have dinner before the fireworks at 9:30, we had a reservation as well. After we were seated had to hunt down our server multiple times just to get drinks or place an order, etc. Also, once we ordered drinks they always came 30-40 min after we ordered from a bartender whom I'm willing to bet is not a bartender. The restaurant could have made probably 2 rounds more of drinks from us if they had been quicker or asked. At one point we ordered shots thinking that would be fast- nope... 30mn. Also, we didn't actually get our food until 9:27pm so we had to scarf it down to make our destination. Waiting for delicious food wouldn't be that bad if you had a drink in your hand. The place wasn't busy either- we were one of 3-4 tables so I have no idea why everything was taking so long. Would I come back? Nope. Good service goes a long way- even though the food was killer- I don't have hours to kill waiting on it to come to me and in the mean time have a frustrating experience trying to be noticed or get drinks. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"How can it be so disappointing? Wait for 10 min to be seated for lunch while there are many empty tables, finally she seats us on one of those reserved tables! Two dirty knives out of three on the table, a forgotten wrench. Slow service, sloppy coffee pouring, totally hard eggs, tasteless chicken sausage. Totally ice diluted bloody mary. No, I will never return to this place eventhough it is right across my hotel and I am here for a week."}
{"text":"Visited Ten Penny this Friday night before a concert with a girlfriend. Still having horror flashbacks of what the considered a panko crusted chicken breast. After being sat in a timely manner table service was slow from the get go and only got worse, took about 30 mins to get a round of waters, drinks and our meals ordered. At this point the restaurant started to become increasingly busy while our meals were brought out. I had ordered the chicken breast on the menu and a friend had ordered the chicken salad. My chicken \"breast\" was an overcooked thin and oddly shaped piece of meat, it was topped with what was described as a rosemary gravy (tasted no rosemary and 100% jarred) and a spicy jelly which was even less appetizing. Along side the chicken was a lump of waterlogged frozen \"kale\" that was described as bacon brined (no flavors of bacon). Nothing on the plate was warm however the plate was scorching hot, clearly sat under a heat lamp for god knows how long. I ate one bite before I deemed the meal completely un edible. I sat there for 30 minutes watching my friend eat her chicken salad that was described as \"well I guess you can't mess up a salad too bad\". Our waiter did not come back to check on our meals until we were ready to get out of there. He asked if he could have it remade, I declined and he was able to remove the meal from the bill. The manager did come over to clear some sides dishes and empathetically responded with \"that's too bad to hear\" when I expressed my displeasure with my meal. Really not sure how this establishment has lasted as long as it has with all the other fantastic restaurants surrounding it. If you are in that area looking for a bite to eat I highly recommend August Henry's next door. Went there after for a drink and to finally get dinner and had a great meal and service."}
{"text":"exactly what you expect from a bar and grill across the street from a convention center... IPAs are not on happy hour? puh-lease. worst happy hour policy ever. dinner was slightly above average - nice presentation and interesting items on the menu - but the actual taste was mehh. I had the tomato soup and grilled Caesar. Soup was decent but not very hot. it was exceptionally thick - imagine marinara sauce? the grilled Caesar got an a+ for the grilled quality, but the Caesar dressing was basically mayonnaise. this dish would be 100000% better with a different dressing.  the table shared the seafood mac and cheese which was so salty I thought it was a joke.   service was good, hostess was friendly and prompt, food came quickly. so 3 star rating is right on point. not terrible but not worth telling your friends."}
{"text":"Cutest place for any meal! Came here for brunch this morning- there was no wait and it was delicious! Obsessed with the urban chic design of this restaurant! Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting downtown Pittsburgh :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Really cool industrial environment- very Pittsburgh! Waiter was a little slow and had no personality."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place as we were walking, and was delighted to find the fare here.  Terrific service and awesome food"}
{"text":"When I learned of Ten Penny's opening, I wanted to check it out and suggested that a lunch there with my co-workers. The interior is tastefully done. Very open, lots of windows, and impressive bar. Lots of wood that screams rustic and comfort. The details to branding are also great. One of my co-workers even leaned over to me and said \"coming to this place made me realize I haven't been anywhere nice in Pittsburgh in a really long time\".   I've read other reviews about the lackluster service. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She came back to check on us in timely intervals. I personally dislike when servers are constantly asking if you need anything. It becomes annoying.   Now about the food. I thought it was decent. I had the crab cake with grits entree. I loved the crab cake which had big lumps of crab and the roasted red pepper sauce layered with a surprising spicy kick. I found the grits to be boring and a bit to chunky for my tastes. My co-worker decided on the chicken curry entree. The server promised that he'd love it. When asked what region the curry was from, she said \"Pittsburgh\". This was an honest answer because we both could barely taste the curry. He did say the black forbidden rice with the broth and bok choy went well together."}
{"text":"Very confused by this place... Cool design, very high end prices, and then a host with old jeans and a polo. Burger was pretty good but service was terrible (you can't have waitress do a private party AND have tables in the main dining room...). Will try again and see if it gets better in regard to overall experience. Otherwise, you can get the same for much less money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ten penny is great for dinner. I went with family on a Saturday night and things were a little loud, especially by the bar, but the staff courteously sat us towards the back away from the bulk of the noise.   The ceasar salad was excellent in the maple candied ham on the side of the salad at a nice zing at the end of the salad.   The family member I was with loved her pasta Primavera with veggies and said that she would order it again if you were to come back to TenPenny. I had the stuffed on this chicken for my main course, and it was good but I feel like, in retrospect, the whipped potatoes and the lemon flavor drowned out both the asparagus and the chicken and, it really seemed like the chicken was a side dish to the whipped potatoes. It's worth mentioning that the menu for the Amish chicken noted that there was an artichoke heart in the dish. I couldn't taste it at all unless it was in the whipped potato stuff.  The staff at tenpenny was all very courteous and very nice, but my biggest issue is that almost as soon as I was done with my salad, my main course and my family member's main course were brought out. The restaurant was fairly busy but not to the point where our main course should've been brought out that quickly.    Overall, I strongly recommend TenPenny, and will definitely go back in the future. Four out of five stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while attending a conference at the center. It's very close to the convention center which is convent. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was good with some nice cheese and mushrooms. My co-worker got a burger. It's a solid place for food while at the convention center."}
{"text":"Ten Penny is just meh. Checked it out for dinner and sort of regretted it as soon as we sat down. The service was a little slow but nice. They barely had any beers on tap, had no Jack Daniels, but did make a pretty good Moscow mule. The food was mediocre at best. The meatball and Italian sausage sandwiches both seemed to have been microwaved, and the sausage was missing peppers and onions which would also be most of the ingredients. The crispy chicken sandwich was terrible. Side salads were good, I asked for balsamic and I got a tomato-y vinaigrette which was actually a good mistake. The price is a little high for what you're actually getting. I think the ambiance of Ten Penny makes it seem like a fancier restaurant, but the menu doesn't really reflect that. Sadly, there's much better options downtown!"}
{"text":"This place was awful.  I came here for a reception of an out of town wedding. While sitting at the bar, another table was upset that our party was making noise.  They complained to the management until they had no choice but to ask us to move.  This happened at 7pm on a Saturday evening.  I would never return to this bar again."}
{"text":"Friday night - 8 to 930pm Medium busy - not full Atmosphere - high potential Crowd - 20/30s  Food- Corn bread - WINNER - nice bourbon flavor Gumbo- PASS - cold and lifeless Mac & cheese - - adults -  EH / teens PASS  More of a hang with friends and munch.  NOT food snob joint."}
{"text":"Really poor service, and extremely mediocre food, at least for brunch. They had a nice draft list, so I'd be willing to check it out for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love the décor and atmosphere.   It's an industrial chic design that's clean, warm, and very inviting.   Bar stools were comfortable and although I didn't sit in one, I liked the booths, which are upholstered settees instead of standard boring booths.   Overall, it was just a great feel.     Food, wine, and service at the bar were all good.   We had a bottle of the house Cabernet and a flatbread.  Both were delicious and I look forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Server Jason fantastic... Excellent service, quite impressive how often servers stop by table just to check when they are totally swamped.  Food is good,  drinks strong, service great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great space but felt a little crowded... I could hear the conversation next to me very clearly. Great service and food but I don't think it's worth the money, it was good but not that good. And the drinks were pretty weak and slightly expensive also."}
{"text":"Stopped in for early afternoon cocktails and had a great time. The drinks were good and the apps we ordered really hit the spot. Our waiter was super friendly and took the time to not only tell us about the cocktails were were curious about, but he also gave us ideas for more things to do on our trip to Pittsburgh.  We will definitely head back here the next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Very cool looking restaurant. It has an industrial style to it that is different from other places. Our waitress  was wonderful and extremely nice and attentive. I love that they don't bring our meals until our appetizer was done. The food was pretty good. My husband has the pork chop which was delicious and I had the truffle Mac and cheese which I was was okay but not great. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had a chance to eat at Ten Penny while in Pittsburgh for a conference.  The atmosphere is interesting and comfortable.  I had the New York strip medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  My friends had the appetizers and burgers. The complaint about the burgers were that we asked for medium rare and they came medium well. The service was good but we had to wait a while for the waitress to come back with the check. Overall I would give the atmosphere a 10 out of 10. I would give the food that I had a 9 out of 10 my friends said the appetizers and burgers were about a 7 out of 10 and the service was an 8 out of 10 overall it is worth it."}
{"text":"(A Monday Afternoon) Very nice place. Friendly staff. Doors and windows open. Good overall beer selection which includes some local options. I personally like the design and the laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was out of this world.  I can for brunch and it was very good.  However the service was awful.  The restaurant was not busy (one table of 9 steeler fans) and a spattering of people here and there.  I waited for 30 min for the food to come.  If it wasn't for good company I would have left.  This is a great location with great food but please fix your service. This will be this restaurants downfall in this primo location."}
{"text":"Cocktails are good but over-priced for the size-especially being in Pittsburgh.  I have yet to have a meal in this restaurant that could be considered good.  Sub-par borderline awful food.  Summary: lovely decor and over-priced drinks.  Food: not up to downtown Pgh standards- disappoints every time over the past year and multiple hopeful attempts."}
{"text":"Good location nice atmosphere. That's about it. I struggled with the Brunch menu. It was hard to find something normal. It reminded me of a California cuisine type of attempt. How about some entrees without all the la de da ingredients? I forced myself to order the pork ribs. They were very tender but the overwhelming mustard base made them unpalatable. Crab cakes looked deep fried and had too much filler and not enough Lump crab. Service was slow but given that the kitchen is on a lower level, it was understandable. Bad layout for the help. Probably a decent bar scene but I wouldn't ever come back to eat. Not my style. I like food on the tasty side. Protein oriented without overwhelming bitter sauces."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Ten Penny - but I was only there for drinks.  I'm a scotch drinker and they had ALL of my favorites and they weren 't too $$$ either!  However, I was the only member of my party not dining that night and the food came out and it looked unremarkable and everyone hated their food.  Another friend of mine said he went there and everyone at his table was served cold steaks.  I dont know, I wasn't there, but this is a new restaurant so I think they are just working the kinks out.  But from the food I saw I think I would probably stick to just drinking here.  Its REALLY pretty inside, I love the atmosphere, its like dining in a really swanky Sur La Tab!  I'll be back, and maybe in a few months I'll try this place for dinner.  The service was good, and you win me over with scotch every time.  Every time."}
{"text":"I always have an amazing meal at Ten Penny, but this time my service was exceptional. My friend and I stopped in for dinner and we had Kevin. He was fantastic. So attentive and helpful. I needed a refreshing drink, and he suggest some and had it tweaked to my tastes. Honestly one of the best dining experiences maybe ever, and it was largely because of Kevin. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I didn't go away hungry. The Pear Salad is awesome, and Truffled Mac 'N Cheese was good as well. Nice atmosphere and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Services was very quick maybe to quick. . We had a flat bread that was under cooked a very oily. I ordered the pork chop and it was fantastic. My wife had the scallops and loved them. Desert was ok and overall for the price maybe not worth the the trip."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant and was a great place for lunch during the week with having a reservation. We had the skillet cornbread for the table which was excellent. One of us had the grilled cheese and tomato soup - she says Ten Penny has her favorite tomato soup ever. Another had the southern fried chicken salad, and I had that day's special - a burger with peaches, jalapeños, and a habanero sauce. They have interesting food options and do great things with combining flavors.   They were packed for lunch, and our server was friendly and helpful. We were visiting over lunch, and they didn't rush us out. Despite it being busy, it was easy to talk and hear one another. I was surprised they weren't rated higher on Yelp: From my experience it is a solid 4 star restaurant, and I would return to Ten Penny again."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, but unfortunately just falls short in several areas.  I will say that it is a great place to get drinks after work.  However that is the best I can say for it here.  The drink selection is mediocre.  Any specialty drink I have had here has always been average and overpriced for what you get.  The service is usually slow as well.  In terms of the food, again it is nothing but average.     The burgers are never cooked properly, the sandwiches are sloppy, the meats taste bland.  The one good thing I have had it the mac and cheese, I would definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"Nice place for a happy hour event"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink during light up night. Since it was kind of out of the heavy traffic area we were able to get to the bar. Service was good. I noticed however that one of the two TVs on our side of the bar had FOX news on. Why would you put either Fox or CNN on in this political climate? Just seems stupid!"}
{"text":"Okay so the positives... 1) good wine selection, 2) awesome location for Furry watching when the convention arrives, 3) beautiful interior and exterior.    I loved the open windows and the brick and beams.  Now the negatives.... 1) food wasn't worth the price (from a taste perspective), 2) didn't love the menu selection and 3) my personal pet peeve....the happy hour specials are only in the bar.      Given my experience at the restaurant kicked off with negative #3, I was biased from the get-go.   I asked our waitress if there were any drink specials and she said no, not tonight.   My boyfriend had done some research before making our reservation and said the website advertised $5 wine and beer and we checked it out on our phones and yep they do.  So we brought it up to the waitress when she returned with our food and that's when we were told, well that's only in the bar!  Guess what, if you had told us that when we had asked the first time, I would have moved to the bar and eaten dinner there.  If that's your policy, I dislike it but at least own it and advertise it!! I'll give this place another shot but only from the bar area which means I'll likely order less food (which is why I don't get bar only happy hour policy to begin with)."}
{"text":"This rating is based on my ability to eat eggs benedict on sundays. If you want the eggs bene, this is a pretty good spot. I may revise my rating but for now I give it 4 stars for eggs benedict and minus one star for not having espresso. Honestly, how can you not have espresso and serve brunch?"}
{"text":"This place looks nice and I had high hopes but it was a total letdown. 1. We had a reservation for 7pm but when we got there our \"table\" wasn't clean yet however several tables around it were clean. We ended up waiting 15 min for it to be cleaned 2. The waitress couldn't answer any drink questions 3. We then waited an over and hour for our food when the same size party who was sat after us got their food a lot earlier 4. The meatloaf states it's stuffed with cheese, it was not, there was no cheese. The beans were most certainly canned beans and the potatoes were boxed and not cook d fully. 5. Was he chicken sandwich was basically just soaked in franks red hot and gross 6. The gumbo had no shrimp in it  Just a total disappointment!!! Don't go!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on the last day of a conference trip. Every time I walked by it was packed. Pretty quiet at 2pm so i stopped in. Instead of getting the full lunch menu, I got the late lunch menu with very limited selection. No problem. I ordered a flatbread with short rib meat. It took 40 minutes to  get  my food. Waitress never checked on me. It was good, but pricey for what I got.  Waited 20 minutes for another server who came over and said he was closing  out my check but three waited had just left. I guess I'm not having dessert."}
{"text":"Good location... bad food & ok service.  Been there a few times in the past few years and it over falls short. Prices are too high based on the food and service"}
{"text":"It was sparsely seated and a Monday night when we showed up with five adults and three kids under 5. They accommodated us, and our server was fantastic. The decor is really quite beautiful, with nice exposed wood, and industrial looking beams and bar area. Some of the booths have really comfy-looking grey couch-like seats. Even though we had three children and ordered no drinks from the bar or high-end entrees, our service was great. Our waiter gave us genuinely personable service and humored is when we asked why they named it \"Ten Penny\" (apparently, during renovations, they found a big bag of ten penny nails left behind from older tenants). The burgers, salads, and flatbreads we ordered were all met with thumbs up reviews from our party."}
{"text":"We stopped in before the game on a Sunday night. Not too crowded. Nice atmosphere. We sat at a high table and I was surprised that the stools were actually comfortable.   The appetizer and share plates looked more interesting than the entrees, so three of us went that route. The son who went with the burger was disappointed, he said it was just ok. My husband had the shrimp and grits.   Small portion but we thought it was tasty. We also shared the crispy brussel sprouts. YUM. And the cheese plate was very delicious even though I felt the slices too small. I would still get it again but would say it was the only thing I felt was overpriced. The other son got the meatball. It was delicious. Good for a light meal leaving room for dessert later.     As for service, it was a little quirky. First we had a trainee then she left us to another waitress. Their check ups sort of lapsed after we were served our food. The servers who brought and cleared were timely and courteous. The hostess however, needs some sensitivity training. As we prepared to go, my son got to the door ahead of us. Noticing his peculiar movements, she blurts out,\" Is something wrong with you?!\"  Idiot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!Their burgers are to die for, and the seafood entrees are delicious. Service has always been superb for me. They also have very sexy booths so you can be romantic with your honey ;)"}
{"text":"I am deeply disappointed in this establishment. Took 20 minutes for us to get a waiter. I finally went to the bar and got a drink, when I asked the bartender if he knew who our waiter was he brushed it off and simply replied \"no idea\". He didn't even bother to find out. Won't be eating here again. Save your time go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been to Ten Penny once when it first opened about two years ago and unfortunately it wasn't a particularly good experience. Being that it was two years ago I chalked that experience up to new restaurant growing pains and my boyfriend and I decided to give it another try yesterday for Valentine's Day. They were one of the few restaurants downtown with an available table and as we learned, it was for good reason.   Before digging into where it went wrong, I'd like to mention some of the good - the decor and atmosphere is great. They paid a lot of attention to detail, the restaurant has a chic modern industrial design and comes complete with monogrammed dinnerware. The draft list is also quite large with a good selection of breweries and styles.   The problems started from the minute we walked in the door, we weren't greeted or acknowledged by the staff for at least 5 minutes, despite a crowd of them being gathered by a terminal no more than arm's length from us at the door. After being seated, the service was also quite slow and disorganized despite only about a third of the restaurant being filled.   The food was also a big disappointment, for the holiday they swapped out their normal menu for a much more limited Valentine's Day menu plus two of their burgers. Our meatball appetizer was simply ok, nothing all that impressive. Both of us ordered their signature burger as nothing on the menu really appealed to us. Both burgers were oozing with grease and lacking in taste. We finished the night with the chocolate cherry whiskey bar (a small dessert for $12) that could only be described as inedible.   Considering the selection of restaurants in the city, I'm really not sure how they managed to stay around this long. This place could be much better than it is if they decided to focus on improving their service and their menu."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and saw a lot of people were eating here so we figured we would give it a try.  The place was absolutely packed!  We tried to sit or even stand at the bar with no luck so the hostess offered us a table right away.    We were just stopping in for a quick bite and some beers.  We ordered the white truffle fries.  They were great!  They were fried perfectly and were crunchy but soft in the middle.  The flavor of the truffle was there but not overpowering.  The aoli they served with it tasted great too.    I saw they had a huge selection of beers, unfortunately they were out of all except 4 or 5.  That was a dissapointment.  I'm sure it was because of the conference and they didn't anticipate the increase in business.    Overall the atmosphere was cool.  They have a large patio area which is nice.  All the staff were friendly and didn't seem frazzled by how busy they were.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This is in a good location and as other reviews say, the place looks great. It had great décor and a cool vibe overall. We stopped in here on a freezing Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty empty.   I enjoyed the seasonal beer selection and would be curious to go back and see what other beers are available throughout the year. The only complaint would be that the calamari and meatball were small portions for the price."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were good, but not amazing. Loved the slaw, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce! Service and atmosphere were great.  Would def go back!"}
{"text":"Ten Penny knows drinks and has a hip bar atmosphere but we tried to make it a brunch spot. Probably a mistake on our part. We ordered a variety of food: eggs benedict, ribs, omlette and truffle mac and cheese. I don't think anyone in our 6-person party was satisfied with their orders. Food was fine, but just fine.  Drinks were good and there was a decent variety of cocktails, beer and wine on the menu. This is what TP does well and they should stick to that! Service was kinda awkward as well (weird interruptions and delivery/clearing of plates) and it took about an hour to get our food although it was relatively empty.   Wished the food was prepared with a little more thought and delivered without feeling intrusive."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience at this place. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant are awesome. Also, there is a huge selection of wine and some great beers. Most of the good was really good, especially the Mac n cheese appetizer. The burgers were good as well. A couple of people at our table got the chicken, not very good, wouldn't recommend that one. Scallops looked good but could have used a better sear on them. Overall, great new place."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and have been for lunch many times. Repeatedly, I find the food to be so below standard. This place has stunning location and great interior but the food just falls flat. Most recently, I got the chopped salad and I'm pretty sure it was pre-made and was sitting in the fridge all morning. Such an easy thing to make to be so bad."}
{"text":"This place had been recommended by a friend so we had high hopes. From the start, the experience was subpar.  Seated at a table with our friends it took 30 minutes from the placement of our drink order to get them, and it wasn't terribly busy to excuse the length of our wait.  The drinks were great tasting however the sugar imbalance of most of them doesn't make for a pleasant feeling later. The food was decent, but the selection of cheeses on the cheese board is cheap for the price.   Nevertheless, service became even worse during the evening. It took us asking three times for water to be initially provided and twice for bread.  Things that are generally automatic elsewhere.  But it didn't end there, the waiter took a timed amount of 40 minutes to take our credit cards despite multiple gesticulations. He was too busy talking to a couple that wasn't even dining at the place.   Sadly, we couldn't even leave ten penny when we wanted to after the valet 'lost' our car and we had to have his supervisor find he car in some other lot a half an hour later. And we still had paid the $10 for the valet because they have you pay in advance (unconventional and probably convenient for the fact that they know they provide terrible service that no respecting customer would pay for).   All around, decent drinks, mediocre food, and awful service lead to a generous two stars."}
{"text":"This is the best staffed restaurant! Everyone there is friendly and genuinely cares about what you want/need. I went in briefly and left so excited to come back. The place is cute with a great feel and the manager is exceptional! It was a female and I didn't catch her name but she ran things so amazingly! Keep up the good work and get there soon!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to go out for a really nice night without breaking the bank? Somewhere with a cool vibe, menu, and drink list? Somewhere you can come with your girlfriends, date, or to celebrate a birthday? This place is for you.   On a Saturday night around 9pm we walked in to this new and gorgeous industrial looking restaurant. Everything was metal and wood and I loved it. The cool sliding barn door caught my eye immediately as did the etched map of Pittsburgh with the name of the restaurant as a focal piece.  There was a little bit of confusion from the get-go. Where to be seated, drinks didn't come out quickly, took a little bit of time to order. All things that happen with a newly opened restaurant, but I promise, it is all worth it.   Our waitress was very sweet. She was efficient in all of her deliveries and made sure our courses were brought out in an appropriately timed manor.  Instead of all 5 of us ordering entrees, we decided to split a bunch of appetizers and shareables. Seared gnocchi, wild mushroom flatbread, truffle fries, crispy Brussels sprouts, and the hot rocks.   The first thing brought out was the hot rocks. For $16 you get 3 different proteins with 3 pieces each, pickled mushrooms, some sort of salsa looking thing, and seaweed salad. The hot rock was huge and actually very smokey, but worth it. Didn't take more than 2 minutes to cook any of the proteins, and it was fun! We chose scallops, tuna, and Kobe beef. All delicious. Especially the scallops!   Once that was taken away we were brought the house breadbasket and truffle fries with bacon and rosemary aioli. We went through 2 baskets of each. There were pretzel rolls with sundried tomato butter, need I say more? And the fries. Oh my god the fries. So incredibly amazing. The best fries I've ever had and I'm a fry-aholic.   The flatbread was forgettable. Overcooked and really pretty dry. The seared gnocchi were to die for. Perfectly crisp on the outside and creamy and delicious on the inside. Some of the best I've ever had. The Brussels sprouts were also a standout. Sweet Jack Daniels sauce pairs with very crispy sprouts, bacon, and hunks of Gorgonzola. It was heaven. Washed down the a prickly pear margarita was certainly the way to go.  Dinner for 5 (who left very full) with 4 cocktails, ended up being $103. Are you kidding? And that was with ordering another basket of amazing fries. This is a great place for any occasion or no occasion at all. Go, now!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for brunch 10 days in advance and called the day prior to confirm. When we got there, the hostess told us that they would have to squeeze us in a table for 4 (party of 6) because our reservation was made on such late notice. I told her 10 days in advance is not \"late notice\" I thought she was a bit rude but they put two tables together for us, which was fine.   Our server was great, he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. He was very polite and he was very fast with our food.   The food came and one person's order was wrong, but they were very apologetic and quick to fix it. The food was great. I had the Ten Penny Hash and I thought it was fantastic. A little expensive for what it was, but the food was good.    So other than being a little expensive and the hostess messing up the reservation, it was good. I would return again."}
{"text":"Cool place right in the middle of a busy area. Food was great but nothing really inventive. Great for lunch, not too sure about dinner."}
{"text":"Everything was good - it was.  It was prepared well, had tasty flavor combinations.  I don't think any of us would have turned our choices away if you put them in front of us again, but I'm not running back. Our server was semi-attentive, the drinks were great, the wine list was decent, beer selections were good, the atmosphere has serious potential.   Nothing knocked my socks off.  I think it'd be a great place to grab a drink or two and an appetizer.  When you're positioned to compete with the likes of Butcher and the Rye (better Pork Belly), Meat and Potatoes (better duck), Emporio (better meatballs), Six Penn (same name play, better lamb) - I could go on - kick it up a few notches."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriends and we had the breakfast flatbread. I swear I want to go back there just for that. It was delicious!!! The mimosa price, not so much. Overpriced. Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant countless times and have never had a problem until I encountered this server, Kelly. She was so incredibly rude. She mocked us when we asked if there were any weekend specials, and was condescending when we tried to order appetizers and no meal even though it was 10:30 at night. I hate to leave a negative review on a place that I enjoy but this server was honestly so rude that it's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Let's set the stage. There's convention center right around the corner. We are on limited time for lunch so as a rule we generally avoid places that looked this nice because they take too long as a rule. Good food just takes longer. Well apparently word got around that it had open seating so unbeknownst to us there was An unspoken consent and we swarmed the place like locusts. This place literally went from a normal lunch crowd to bursting at the seams in about 5 minutes. What usually happens in this case comes to pandemonium. Not this time. Their shocked looks quickly changed to determination and they set to work. There are issues when a restaurant gets slammed like that with delays and such. In my opinion, they much less than I would have expected from them. For the life of me I cannot remember the name of the waiter but if anyone official is looking at this, we were the group of five in the horseshoe booth with me sitting in the extra chair they got for us on Tuesday the 8th. This waiter was awesome. He was constantly on the move, making sure everyone was taken care of, and keeping us informed when there was a slight delay. We couldn't have asked more of any server, especially when considering the stress they were certainly under at that time. Now to the food and drinks. I like my Moscow Mules, most mule drinks for that matter, and this one was definitely on par. The food, however, was definitely above par. I got the brussel sprout appetizer which everyone tried and they all loved them. I had shrimp and grits entreè which was outstanding, as good as when I've gotten it in the south where I understand it to have originated. Others in my party ordered gumbo, grilled cheese and tomato soup,  salad, and steak of some kind. Everyone was impressed and completely satisfied with the entire experience. Next time I'm in Pittsburg I will make certain I stop here for another great experience. Thanks for reading my ramblings!"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsbugh for a business convention and came here to get some breakfast.  The resturaunt was about half full when we came in.  It took the server about 10 min before she came to our table.  We had a few question about the menu and she said she wasnt sure the answers.  She left and cameback with an answer.  Which after we received our food we learned was incorrect.  The food was subpar and the service was horrible.  I recxomend for anybody contemplating eating here think a little harder and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So - last night I had dinner with Friends at TenPenny. We were given the private room in the back which had been set for a party of 14.  With the fireplace on - we had one of our best dining experiences. Their new menu is OUTSTANDING - everyone loved their meals - and when complimented by two bottles of Dom, four bottles of Tenor 1:1, cakes by Vanilla and served by Rachael, who was unanimously described as 'That server was probably the best and most professional I have ever experienced in Pittsburgh' - it made for a perfect evening...  If you have not been here - go. If have - go again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this pace because the atmosphere is cute and the street it sits on is picturesque. We were seated in the back room apart from the rest of the restaurant and it was poorly ventilated, so it was hot. I ordered the veggie omelet, which looked great, but when I took my first bite I found eggshells"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend & definitely won't be back. My friend ordered the \"caesar salad\" which was literally 1 wedge of lettuce about as big as her fist with some dressing on it and 1 piece of cold bacon on the side. This should not even count as an appetizer, let alone a meal item. I didn't look at the price, but I'd assume it was on the same page with the rest of the salads, which were about $10 - $14. She had to go somewhere else to pick up something else to eat after we left.  I ordered a chopped salad, which was about as good as a gas station salad. I may have even had a better salad from a convenience store/gas station before. The salad was mostly crappy iceberg lettuce with some peas, tiny pieces of unripe tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, with about an eighth of a teaspoon of crumbled bacon & 4 fried onion pieces. It was supposed to have a garlic vinaigrette on it, but I tasted no dressing on it whatsoever. The \"grilled turkey\" in it was about a tablespoon or 2 of tiny, tiny turkey cubes. And this salad was $12. This place is a rip off, and just not good."}
{"text":"The ambiance was pretty cool.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but still good.  The prices for drinks were average, food moderate.  Our server was very nice, however, service was pretty slow.  We didn't get any of the neat appetizers (hot rocks) or desserts (s'mores), but we were able to see other people who had ordered those, which seemed pretty neat.  I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely come again.  Perhaps, for happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here for a gathering with friends around on New Years Eve Eve. It was pretty quiet as I'm sure most were gearing up for the next night. Overall, it was perfect for our gathering.   The atmosphere is cool but relaxed. There was good music. It was like a familiar playlist of 90s music--loud enough for you to hear, but not so loud that you had to shout over it. Our server did a good job of keeping up with our drinks and things. The cocktails took a while to make. Maybe it was a new bartender or they were understaffed? Considering the light crowd, drinks should have come a little faster.  I liked their beer list and they have some interesting cocktails. A pumpkin/maple whiskey drink didn't really work for me -- and they were apparently out of the preferred whiskey. I also tried a drink with cucumber and pickle juice. Sounds crazy, but I like pickles. The only good thing about this one was that it made me sip slow -- saving me money and my friends from seeing me get too crazy!  The TP No. 1 Cup was the best drink I sampled and I would order it again. Doesn't pack much punch, though.  For food, the meal was satisfying, but not incredibly memorable. There are a lot of options, so I think you can expect everyone to find something that they will enjoy. The appetizers were more interesting than the entrees. Nothing was bad, but I just wanted a little more excitement for the price on some of the entrees.  Overall, I liked this place, but considering I'm only in town once or twice a year anymore, I'd try a few more places before coming back. But if someone suggested it again, I'd go along. I'd prefer it for drinks and apps and then maybe try dinner some place else."}
{"text":"Stopped on for dessert this weekend!   My kids had the Red Velvet ice cream and Vanilla bean ice cream. My son said it was the BEST ice cream he's ever had. It was served in the cutest little coffee cup.  We had the cranberry tartlette that came with 2 donuts and ice cream. I loved the tartlette. It's crust was crispy with an oatmeal brown sugar topping.  A friend had the peanut butter torte with salted caramel topping and said it was delicious!  I had the truffles. The variety was neat! The frambois was my favorite! My second fav was the ancho chile. The first bite is just plain chocolate and as it melts in your mouth it gets spicy!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Service is so slow. You would think that being literally across the street from the Westin that they would be used to business travelers. My party of four arrived for lunch and said right up front...we only have an hour.  We sat and sat and sat for our meals. Salads and soups.  Nothing that should take that long. And they weren't that busy. Our food came after 50 minutes. We had them bring takeout containers and ended up eating our lunch back at the hotel in our meetings.  My crab cake salad was just ok. My friends tomato soup was salty and the grilled cheese dry.  Don't just go there because it's convenient to the hotel."}
{"text":"Let's all give this place a try because let's face it--we want more fun restaurants downtown. First off, the atmosphere is great-loved the decor and the fact that in the summer I bet they can open up all the windows and it will be super fun. I like to give restaurants that just open a little break on some of the mishaps that might otherwise not happen during their opening week so I will definitely be back to try again.  Food:  We ordered the jack daniels/bacon/cheese brussel sprouts and of course they were delicious. Actually a pretty good portion too. People at our table had the filet, duck breast, and the parpardelle pasta. Definitely the duck breast was the winner --it was delicious and so were the sides--only complaint there would be maybe a teence more of the sides. The filet was fine--cooked pretty well, I didn't try it but I heard the pasta wasn't very flavorful. We also ordered the chocolate pretzel dessert which was super good.  They kept running out of wine and beer which I thought was pretty odd--but they do have a sommelier who will come around and give you some wine tips. All in all there are several things I want to come back and try after a few weeks/months.  Pros:  Yummy sounding apps and cocktails (couldn't try them all) Service is friendly Duck breast Decor Complimentary sparkling water (do they have a soda stream?)  Cons: Some of the food was a little bland (pasta/mashed potatoes) Ran out of wine and beer (select few)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere-A+ Food - D Service -D First off...the atmosphere is really cool, unfortunately this is the only nice thing to be said.  My wife's food came out as if it had been dunked in the fryer...the server had to be asked for more coffee and even then it took her a little while to get it...then, it wasn't even warm.  I asked for more cream and of course it never came.  The server had work a quick turn around and it showed...I don't blame her, but you have to have a little more enthusiasm in this job even if you are tired.  Unfortunately we will never return!"}
{"text":"Other reviews are correct... Overpriced food, not great service, but cool decor.  They were out of prosecco, so I got wine and it taste watered down. :'(  When it came time to order the waitress said the kitchen cannot do a flatbread with half cheese half no cheese. My boyfriend and I were sharing and he is not vegan so he wanted the cheese... Seems like a reasonably ask as they put the cheese on top but NOPE.   The flatbread at soo much flour on it... Gross!   Only came here because the good restaurants had too long of a wait, won't be back here."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment 3-4 times since it opened. The food and service previously were ok....nothing to write home about, but not terrible either. The last visit, yesterday afternoon, was horrendous. It was a Saturday afternoon and not very busy. The server did not write anything down, and came back 3 times to confirm what we ordered. The people in our party (5) actually joked if the order would come out correct....and alas, it did not. Food was cold. It was obvious it sat for a long time before being brought to the table. Appetizers and entrees were brought at the same time. The server never checked back and I had to find a manager to take care of the issue. There was never an \"I'm sorry\", the server was then incredibly rude, only doing what he had to. And we had to ask for our food to be replaced with hot versions. Save your money....there are many great restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. The decor is hip, food and service are horrible."}
{"text":"First time here. Stayed at the courtyard and looking for a place to eat. Got in at 7:45 was told there would be an hour wait to sit because of a lot of parties but the bar was open. Informed at the bar that food would take an hour. Looking at the restaurant it was halfway empty. Only two parties one of 5 the other of 11. We asked for drinks. Took 15 minutes. Asked how long would a salad and hushpuppies take. They said about 20 it took 45 minutes for a salad and four very small hushpuppies that were supposed to have crab in them. None in it. I finished my drink and not once asked if I wanted another. We placed a to go order since they close at 9. Our order sat for ten minutes. Before we questioned the bag it's now 9.  Now they're asking if we want another drink. The best thing about the place was the salad.  Although that came out wrong as well as the second order of drinks. I don't live in Pittsburgh but next time I'm here I won't be back."}
{"text":"I got sick after eating here. Really sick. I wasn't the only one. All we ate was the Mac and cheese. The only thing that the other infirm and I shared the entire day.   Sigh..."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on invite for a yelp event.   Service was very attentive, I made friends with a server named Eddy, very nice guy!   For the yelp event we sampled the cocktails, I really enjoyed the cucumber one mixed with gin, followed by the tangueray cocktail which had a more citrusy taste but tasted stronger, I could not swallow the coffee flavored patron cocktail wayy to harsh.   Salmon was delicious but fell apart do easy. My favorite was artichoke stuffed with goat cheese and asparagus soup!! Chicken meatballs were good, but missing the determining taste of pineapple sauce.   The vibe at tenpenny was casual but at the same time a little dressier. I felt a little Underdressed with only a sweater on. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came here during a cold Nov. day when we were stuck at a business conference.  Honestly, it was the closest place that looked pretty decent.  We were NOT happy.  Our service took forever, the hostess stand attendees were not friendly at all (up and down looks) and the food was only mediocre.  I think they might not been ready for the massive crowd that came with the business convention and service came to a grinding halt.  The salad that my dining partner had, had fries - she liked that, but she said that was the only thing good about it.  I was dining on shrimp and grits.  The shrimp didn't taste fresh and the grits were bland.  overall this was completely disappointing.  Good thing we were reimbursed by the job for our meals."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch there just other day. Freezing cold out and tomato soup with grilled cheese sounded just perfect.  Not. This was possibly the worst grilled cheese sandwiches of my life. How you ask? Im not sure. Try Texas toast. Put one slice of white and one slice of orange cheese on it. Make sure there is not enough on so that it oozes out and looks all yummy when you try to eat it. Grill the sandwich well before the rest of the meals are ready to be served so what cheese is there has a good long time to solidify before serving. I think those are the tricks. As to service, our waitress was quite pleasant and stopped often. But important note - if you're going to stop four times to ask how everything is - look your customer in the eye and pause so that they can answer before you run off. Otherwise your question was meaningless.  I would not hurry back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review:  I hate sitting at a bar alone with 1 other person, wondering if this was a lame place to go, and if I was lame for suggesting it.   Don't worry, this isn't that spot - so go on witcha bad self and impress your friend or coworker with your cool happy hour knowledge.  The food and cocktails are all specialty, but the beer selection is also pretty great! It gets busy after work and there is plenty of bar space and there are lots of high-tables to choose from, so if you wore a fierce skirt to work that day you can choose which place you're more comfortable (amen, ladies).  Taste - 8 Atomsphere - 7 Service - 6/7 Style - 8"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for Valentines Day. In my opinion, they were not very busy. The service was VERY bad and VERY slow. I doubt our waitress ever worked in the restaurant business before. She took our order at 630pm and we never saw her again until someone else brought out our dinner at 740pm. Along with the very poor service, there were cobwebs in the light fixtures.  The good news was the food was perfect and maybe worth the wait. Pork chop and Salmon were perfectly prepared with a lot of flavor and richness. The mixed greens were very unique and crisp.  The seafood Mac and cheese was awesome. Thanks to the culinary team, they saved our evening. 3 stars ALL the the culinary team."}
{"text":"Try to stop in to eat but after the fourth person asked us to wait a few minutes we tired and left and went down the street.  I can't comment on the food but the wait staff and hostesses need more training.  It was woefully understaffed"}
{"text":"The perfect place for entertaining. Very inviting. I had a reservation for 15 and Craig the manager made sure everything went smoothly. Great service. The chicken and waffle dish is one of my favorites. The meatball is a must have too. The beer selection is great and with the private club downstairs, you can entertain as long as you'd like. Colleagues of mine have memberships to Penn Society downstairs so we went for cocktails after dinner. Our bartender was great and made one of the best Moscow Mules I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was our second time to TenPenny - both times at the bar for drinks.  First time we were there was an OK experience.  This time, however, we had a very negative experience with the bar staff - bad enough that I'm taking the time to write a review about it. The bar itself is beautiful, very well-appointed, but still casual and warm.  There are several unique drinks that are generally well-made, although somewhat repetitive - especially with the over-use of ginger beer in a high percentage of the drink options.   One thing about their bar drinks I really did not like is that if it is not specified on the menu, and if you do not specify when ordering a \"common\" drink (martini, cosmo, etc), the drinks taste like they were made with cheap well liquors instead of higher quality options - even though you pay the higher quality price.  This is completely unacceptable.    As I said above, however, our primary complaint was with our two bartenders last night (Saturday evening 12/26/15).  Though it was busy but not packed, both of the bartenders were extremely unfriendly and unpleasant - like nothing I think I've ever experienced before.  Zero friendly chatter, virtually no interaction whatsoever, and they both looked almost put out to have to serve us.  Having served & bartended for nearly ten years, I'm well aware that the holiday season is the most lucrative time of year to work in the industry - people basically WANT to give you their money, they WANT to give you generous tips, and if you are even remotely friendly and good at your job, you will get 25-30% or more on a very consistent basis.  You have to TRY EXTREMELY HARD to get a bad tip in the holiday season, but I simply could not force myself, even with my food service background, to reward two of the most unpleasant people I've ever been served by with a good tip.    It was a very frustrating experience, our first experience at TenPenny was nothing special, and given Pittsburgh's embarrassment of riches when it comes to go restaurant options - we won't be back."}
{"text":"pros: very close to the convention center, courtyard hotel. Also nice spacious bar and atmosphere.   Cons: everything else. The drinks are terrible. Even one of the draft beers was bad! I had a Moscow mule for $18 because you have to buy your own cup (stainless steel, not copper). The food was worse than the drinks. I had stuffed flounder and I couldn't find one lump of crab in the crabmeat. It was served over bland quinoa and even blander Bok choi. Blah."}
{"text":"Again on my visit to Pittsburgh for work I find my self starving and in desperate need for food, this time I'm on a time crunch.   Food: It was not the best salad I ate but pretty good. Just felt like a lot of things thrown on and the dressing had a slight kick to it that I personally didn't like. Doesn't mean you won't. The highlight may have been the cornbread croutons, so.good!  Service: There was an hour wait to be seated so we grabbed a bar seat. Our waitress was attentive despite the rush and when we mentioned that we had to be somewhere in 30 mins she had the manager go and check on our salads. Very much appreciated.   Atmosphere: Very.Loud! Definitely wouldn't recommend this if you're trying to have a heart felt conversation. If it's just to have a couple of drinks and a quick meal with friends it's not a bad place. I did like the set up and decor a lot."}
{"text":"Drinks were good.  The copper rush is the libation I enjoyed.  But I can't recommend the salmon.  It was fishy taking and a little overdone.  They used three or four different sauces and it was too much.   Really oversauced.  Good salmon should have moderate accompaniment, in my opinion.  Dining companion said the burger was great, so I might try that next time."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance before heading to a show.  Whenever I got there the place was pretty packed and it would become even more full during the time that we were there.  Thankfully my fiance works downtown and so she already had a table for us whenever I arrived.  It ended up being quite a nice table as we were facing out to Penn Avenue and the outside windows/doors were open giving us a nice breeze.  Other than that the restaurant looked pretty modern with almost all of the tables being hi-top tables with some of the tables looking like that were recycled and re-purposed.  There was also some cool art near the exposed beams of the ceiling as they have a wood planks up towards the ceiling with a number of bottles on top running the length of the restaurant.  Since it was still happy hour whenever my fiance and I arrived, we decided to start off our meals by getting some drinks.  They have a pretty decent selection of beers, most of them being $5 during happy hour, so I went with the Elysian Jasmine IPA while my fiance went with the Fat Head's Bumbleberry.  For our meals we decided to start of the evening by splitting the Crispy Brussels Sprouts appetizer.  It consisted of the fried Brussels sprouts topped with a Jack Daniels' balsamic glaze, candied bacon and blue cheese.  I really enjoyed it as the crispy Brussels sprouts were good on their own but when combined with the sweet glaze, sweet and salty candied bacon and pungent blue cheese, they ended up being really good.  The only thing that I would possibly change with them would be to have the glaze on the side as I think that the glaze made some of the Brussels sprouts soggy and so why even make them crispy in the first place?  Then for my entree I went with the Ten P. Burger which is their signature burger while my fiance went with the seared sea scallops which she enjoyed.  I ordered the burger medium and besides the patty it had on it a fried egg, watercress, red onion jam, cheddar, bacon and pickled vegetables and came with a side of french fries.  The burger itself ended up being pretty good with some nice flavors, especially the red onion jam, and although I missed any taste of pickled vegetables, I could see them on it.  My only problem with the burger is one of my biggest pet peeves with burgers and that was that they didn't toast the bun.  Seriously, if you are serving a gourmet burger with a ton of toppings, TOAST THE BUN.  I want my bun to hold all of the ingredients they are heaping on it and not be a soggy mess that is falling apart whenever I bite into it like this one was.  Apart from the burger, the french fries that came with it were some of the better french fries that I have had recently, crispy and seasoned nicely.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Since I did not look at the menu before coming here, I was a little surprised with the prices.  However the quality and taste of the food more than backed it up.  I really did enjoy the flavors that they had in the food and would be interested in trying some more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"I know I am going to come across as the 'angry vegan', but I promise you I am not.  I asked the waitress very nicely if the chef had any plant based options or if he could put something together (there was ZERO options on the menu).  I actually said, whatever he could make I would be great with. She came back and said they could make a pasta dish.  She asked if it was okay if they used butter (crazy) and I told her oil would be fine - can't eat butter.  She had no idea what plant based or vegan was, yet I couldn't be the first vegan to ever eat at this fine establishment.  Anyway, was wishing for the best and ended up with a pasta dish loaded with - not butter - but cheese.  Again, can't eat.  I told the waitress I couldn't eat it but not to worry about making another dish.  I had a side salad and asparagus that would be fine.  She ended up making it anyway....this time with at least a 1/4 cup of butter on it!  Ha.  Tough night.   Would have been fine with just a salad if they said they didn't have any options for me.  I am used to it in Pittsburgh and try to avoid those 'vegan scenes' that annoy so many.  Anyway, was hoping for a lot better."}
{"text":"I love this place way too much for my own good! One thing I really love is that the host/hostess is always nice, no matter how busy they are.   The decor is absolutely amazing! I usually sit at the bar but the seats at tables are sooo comfy and huge.   They've got a large selection of beer on tap but I always go for wine, which the offer in multiple pour amounts. For food my first time in we got the Mega Meatball which was delicious! I stick to the filet mignon, cooked medium rare and they do it perfectly every time. Thick, juicy and flavorful.   Service is fast, friendly and attentive. The bartenders are great for conversation - I always get Rich and Sam.   Whether it's a date or stopping in after work by myself, it's always the right atmosphere and a good time!"}
{"text":"First time there I was pleasantly pleased with the decor.  Waitress was attentive serving our appetizer very quickly.  We had the Mediterranean Flatbread. Lacking in much flavor; wouldn't order again.  We had the Scallops which were very tender but the Ahi tuna plate had to go back because nothing was hot on the plate.  The manager came over quickly to apologize and made the new plate. That was good with generous portion of tuna.   Green beans very fantastic.   Drinks are reasonably priced which is nice to see for a change.  We will try this place again."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my overall experience at Ten Penny this weekend.  But I hate to start anything with a complaint so I will list the positive first:  1.  Really good service.  Our waitress was on the ball and kept checking in on us.   2.  Cool decor and a great location downtown. 3.  They accept reservations on Open Table.   That's my positive.  Here's the negative:  1.  I ordered the shrimp and scallop risotto.  It was served lukewarm at best.  I'm always hesitant to send a meal back so I ate it at the not so great temperature.  Also, it was really salty.   2.  Price.  Honestly, if a meal is delicious (and served hot!) I don't complain about price, but I think this was a little high.    I suppose I'd come back to have a drink here before a show but not for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute WORST.  We sat down and it took over 20 minutes for someone to even take our drink orders.  Then 40 minutes later,  the food showed up...still no drinks. Then two beers showed up....still no cocktails for the rest of us. I'm still sitting in this sad excuse for a bar completely drinkless.  They try to pass off a trendy atmosphere as reason to put up with sub par service but it is not worth your time. The food looks like something you could get anywhere else in this city, so also nothing special enough for a 30 minute wait.  My solution for you, fine readers,  is to go five blocks down the road to The Commoner bar inside of the Hotel Monaco on William Penn Place. Great food,  fun atmosphere,  excellent service.   O look,  my drink finally arrived.  It's tasteless. I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"Ten Penny was our second stop on a summer Saturday afternoon in the middle of a birthday bar crawl. It was a nice, cool, and relaxed spot on a very hot day. Our large group - at least 15 of us - spread out around over half the bar. I spent the first few minutes just staring at my surroundings. Like most amp'd group establishments, the restaurant is very well decorated with significant attention to detail. Ten Penny has a casual, rustic-industrial feel.  My review of food and drink unfortunately is limited. I tried to order a summer cocktail - I believe it was an enticing-looking sweet tea vodka sort of concoction? - but sadly it wasn't available for some reason. I settled for a different cocktail and my husband and I split the Ten Penny Candy Bar. Both were nice but didn't blow my mind. The cocktail was tasty while the candy bar was good but very hard to break apart and eat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the bartenders where great but the service when you're seated was poor to say the least. We waited 30 minutes before anyone came to take a drink order.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"This place could not be worse. Third time here. No one even acknowledged us after ten minutes. I'm taking my pennies to Bill's Burgers. Get it; it's a pun."}
{"text":"Tried Ten Penny last night and had spotty service at the bar (one nice and one not so) then ordered the short rib which was one big plate of fat. Hated to be \"that guy\" but sent it back for the meatloaf stuffed with cheese. It came. No cheese. Good wine list though."}
{"text":"There had to have been a full moon the other night when I dined at Ten Penny, because things were just weird. I've dined here a number of times, including brunch, lunch and dinner. I've had pretty good experiences so far, so when me and my date were looking for a dinner option on a recent Saturday night, I suggested having dinner here. We had no issue getting a reservation around 7:45 and we were quickly seated in the rear of the restaurant. I love the ambiance of this place - it's sexy and very rustic. What I hate is that they take it all the way down to the tables. For example. the table we sat at was formerly a drafting table. So, to my (knees) surprise, they were literally up against a large wheel under the table - ouch! I can look beyond this, but definitely not a great choice for a table. Things got interesting when the waiter came by. If all my previous experiences here are good, the reason why they haven't been great is because of the wait staff. I've found they either provide too much attention or the extreme opposite. On this particular night, I found him to be extremely attentive, but in an annoying, you need to calm down kind of way. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, something in the $30-40 range. When I ordered the bottle, the waiter seemed confused and directed me to another page in the menu where wine prices seemed more than double that cost. Confused, I asked, \"Didn't I just order a bottle?\" It was awkward. I couldn't figure out if he was trying to upsell me, confuse me, or what not.  We ordered the salmon and cioppino dish - both seafood. For an appetizer, we order the shrimp and grits. I enjoyed the appetizer, although my date was looking for a more traditional serving a grits (here, it is a fried grit patty). Our entrees came relatively quickly and were delivered by our server and a busser. The busser standing closest to me held the salmon, the waiter held the cioppino. Here's where it got really wacky. I counted the waiter directing the busser to place the salmon in front of my date almost four times before he ended up just dropping the plate on the table. Perhaps the guy was nervous or had a bout of the shakes, but it was awkward. I wanted to just grab the plates out of their hands. My guests would have been fine scrapping the food off the table and eating it, but I was not having that, so we sent the meal back to the kitchen. The waiter then proceeded to take the cover off the cioppino. I refused to eat the meal until my date's meal was back at the table (which was the right thing to do). Waiter was apologetic and noted that he'd bring some food out to us while we waited. We received bread - some moist mini muffins and two awfully dry pretzel buns with a pumpkin butter - leftovers from brunch perhaps? I shouldn't have eaten those bland calories, but I was hungry and was quickly getting buzzed off the overpriced bottle of wine. Our meals finally returned and we got to work. Neither my guest or I really loved our meals, both noting they lacked a bit of flavor and uniqueness, although the preparation on the plate was clean and nice.   Listen, I've been a waiter and even spilled soup on someone's foot. Things happen and I get that, but I noted above how service always seems to be questionable here. Would I return? Yep, but I'd strongly suggest the management staff try to instill some consistency and standards within its wait staff. This place has a lot going for it and I do want to see it continue to succeed."}
{"text":"I have gone to Ten Penny for both brunch when it first opened and for happy hour. The atmosphere has changed greatly from the first and last time I had gone. When I went for brunch, there was not another table in the place. Now it has become one of the busiest restaurants on Penn.   The service I received both times was pretty decent. The first time we were the only table and some of the other guests noted that it had taken a good bit of time to get our food. Some even complained that their food was cold. I, however enjoyed my food. I ordered a special. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind of fish it was. I do remember that the skin was cooked perfectly and it came with traditional French lentils with sausage, carrots, onion and celery. The lentils were also really good. So good that I started making the very same ones at home.  The second time I went to Ten Penny it was for happy hour. I will be honest, I had heard some mixed opinions regarding food and service since I had initially gone so I was a little nervous that it would be disappointing. Luckily it wasn't. The bar was packed but it didn't seem to take long to get a drink or our food. A few of my colleagues and I split some appetizers. We ordered a margherita pizza, the truffle mac n' cheese and shrimp with polenta done 3 ways. All three were good but I believe the mac n' cheese was my favorite.I am aware of the criticisms chefs make concerning truffle oil but if it tastes good I eat it. I will say that it was a little oily but it was also very cheesy and creamy. Overall, the experience was a good one and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Tenth and Penn, the perfect corner for a great meal!  I've been to Ten Penny on several occasions at different times during the day: brunch, dinner, late night drinks. Every time I've always experienced exceptional service and a delicious meal.  I've bee seated in the larger dining area as well as the private back room for a birthday and the full restaurant is decorated beautifully.  Every time I come back here I can't stay away from the Truffled Fries--and the hot rocks, brunch sandwiches, and s'mores desserts are awesome. This is one place that I've never adventured with the specials because the usual menu sounds better than the specials.  The specialty cocktails are delicious and make a great treat to a night out all on their own!  Lunch during the week seems like the slowest time for them, but make sure to make a reservation if you're looking for brunch or an evening spot!"}
{"text":"Had a Kentucky mule bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable. Seems as if management is probably pretty shitty. They had this girl sitting at the bar for an interview for an eternity... Then to top it off no vaping... This place sucks."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here. We sat in a booth in the back which you think would be somewhat quiet, but it was loud and hard to hear each other at times. Our waitress was ok.. She was honest about one item we wanted to order, but otherwise I unattentive. Our food took a long time to come. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Portion sizes are large. We had the Mediterranean flatbread and it was salty. ."}
{"text":"I went to Ten Penny for brunch on a Saturday not long after they had opened and was extremely happy with everything. The atmosphere, as others have commented, is fantastic. Two of us had a daily special of carrot-cake pancakes, which were fantastic. Light and sweet, not dense and comatose-sugary. I can't remember what else we ordered, something in the Ruben family and something in the eggs and bacon family. In any case, the food was great and the service was great. We really didn't have any complaints. I was a little pricey - I think we paid $60-75 for four breakfasts? We had coffee and juice but no alcohol. We all felt it was worth it for such a great experience, though."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because it was close to our hotel and it looked very inviting i.e. open to the outside, nice tables and ambiance.  We asked to sit at the bar because we just wanted drinks and some appetizers.  We sat down as some people vacated.  The bartender removed some of the dirty dishes and offered us menus.  We thought we wanted drinks but then decided we wanted a bottle of wine.  We requested a wine menu and were presented with one that only had wines by the glass.  We had to wait to get her attention to request the bottle menu.  Why are these separate?  She returned to take our drink order and I had to request that she wipe the bar surface as there were still stains, wetness, etc. from the previous party.  She grabbed a very wet rag and wiped the surface, leaving us to have to sit back and wait for it to dry for about 5+ minutes.  Of note, she didn't finish clearing the other items that were at other seats until someone sate there, nor did she wipe them down.  This may have been the bar back's job but he was moving as slow as he could.  He also cleared dirty glasses with his fingers in them and then unloaded the glass washer, without washing his hands.  We had a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  The bottles we normally would have ordered, were a 400% markup so we weren't really interested.  We ordered the crispy brussel sprouts, margherita flatbread, and cheese plate.    We were fully disappointed in all.  The crispy brussel sprouts were not crispy at all.  They probably were crispy when they came out of the deep fryer but the application of the Jack Daniels balsamic vinegar and then the presentation in a cast iron pan, caused them to meld into a mushy, gooey mess.  Putting the vinegar on the side might help but they were not crispy at all.  The margherita flatbread was the most edible of the three but it was underdone.  The crust was not crispy at all.    The cheese plate was almost wholly inedible.  I have had many cheese plates that had honey included on them but never was it drizzled all over everything on the plate.  My husband is deathly allergic to bees and so he doesn't attempt eating honey.  We expected a small blob or honeycomb on the side so didn't request no honey because he would have been able to avoid it.  There were some sprouts on the plate that had no clear purpose.  I had to taste the cherries to determine what they were.  The cheese was very bland and with honey all over my hands, I gave up.  The bartender was very inattentive.  The bar wasn't full so I'm not sure what her priority was.  She was cleaning glasses at one point so her lack of a good bar back could have been a factor but priority should always be the customer.  I requested a glass of ice water to accompany the food.  I drank it, pushed it forward and it was never refilled in her couple of walkbys.  When clearing the plates, she didn't comment on the fact that much of the food still remained.  In the end, we wanted to just cut our losses, get our bill and leave."}
{"text":"Well basically a bust. Was excited to finally get here and 4 out of the 5 beers that were on the menu they were out of. Split a burger which was good. Would have been better if they were fresh cut fries. Cold ketchup was a plus though. Cool atmosphere but hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"OK for drinks at the bar. Held half the restaurant for a group that didn't show up for 2 hours. Ended up eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got to try 2 dishes last night thanks to #grubhub app. I ordered the Truffle fries and Truffle mac and cheese. The pork was perfectly cooked and you can smell the white truffle as soon as you open the lid. The fries were perfectly cooked and you can smell the white truffle as soon as you open the package. I enjoyed both items and will be ordering from here in the future!"}
{"text":"The only thing saving this from a 1 star review is the fact that the manager applied a discount to each and every once of our separate checks after we complained about the food.  Unfortunately, if the manager had been there from the get-go, maybe everything would have run more smoothly in the first place.  Staff was slow and seemingly uninterested in making our experience stellar.  Our server was the only saving grace at least in terms of attitude.  That said, I don't know if it was his fault or the kitchen's that multiple orders came out wrong, had to be sent back and did not come out correctly until the rest of us had finished eating.  I could see my hungry friends looking more and more anxious with each passing minute.  The food itself was average at best.  The $18 smoked salmon benedict was one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever ordered at a restaurant.  Tiny pieces of salmon that did not taste that fresh, bland and congealed hollandaise sauce and cold eggs.  We also split the carrot cake pancakes which I found delicious but others were less impressed.  Every single one of our plates came out cold to lukewarm.  A couple positives: the atmosphere is great and the location is prime.  Also, their draft beer selection is awesome but the bartenders were not knowledgeable enough to offer recommendations and the menu was badly outdated so you had basically no idea what type of beer you may want to try."}
{"text":"I went to an event at the convention center and the group I was with decided to come here on a whim for brunch. It was just before 1pm or a little after. I was excited for this place. We were seated at a table for four on the other side of the bar. I noticed it wasn't very busy at all. I absolutely loved the layout and how they took advantage of the space. Everything from the choice of lighting to the shelves was appealing. The booths looked so comfy, but I didn't get a chance to sit in one this time.  Our waitress came over pretty quickly and gave us water. I ordered hot tea. The lady who brought me my tea cup set down a dirty one with someone's lipstick stain still on the cup. I quickly pointed it out and she gave me another one. I was kind of suspicious the rest of the time of all my silverware and any plate that was put in front of me. It looks like that was a one time deal this visit.  I did like the menu options and thought it was creative and interesting enough. I ordered eggs benedict with salmon. After someone took our order, it took so long for it to come out. By that time the place started to fill up a bit. I think we didn't start eating until close to 2 or a bit after. Two people at my table had salads and the other person got a flat bread. We kept looking at each other like \"where is the food\". After I got my order I asked for ketchup for my potatoes and never received it. Instead of asking again I just ate without it because I was starving. The food was lukewarm leaning more towards cold.  I did think the plate would be somewhat bigger and that's probably because of my experience at other brunches. Each side of the English muffin had one piece of salmon on it (which was $6 extra...) and overall it was good. My potatoes were plain. I didn't taste any seasoning whatsoever but then again it could be my personal taste and not necessarily that they weren't seasoned.  Our waitress was friendly, the food took way too long, the atmosphere was chill and comfy, decor is fab, they had great music, and the food was tasty overall. I would like to try this place again and maybe go for an adult beverage and branch out on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh.  There's really no better way to describe it.  There are some good things about this place, but the majority was just kinda average, if not painful.  The Good: ambiance is open and contemporary, and the Porcini Mascarpone Ravioli is stellar. Creamy, flavorful and rich. A definite must order.  The Bad: meatballs were just okay, I've had better at more fast casual type places. Cocktails were alright; a little overly sweet but nothing too terrible.  Everything overall just seemed a bit overpriced for the quality.  The Ugly: the Lamb Chops. Oh my goodness...my poor friend got stuck with the lamb and it was really bad. It came out ice cold, and not cooked or seasoned well. She sent it back, and they came back out with a lamb that was slightly warmer, but still inedible. If you like lamb, do not order this one. It's a big turnoff on an otherwise lovely meat.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll definitely be skipping this place."}
{"text":"Service was very slow.  Dinner was incorrect when first brought to table.  Fish was burned and cooked to consistency of cardboard.  Manager clearly used to having these types of mistakes from kitchen.  Beet salad was quite good.  Will not be returning - too many better options in the area."}
{"text":"First thoughts on a first visit; good ambience, love the decor and openness of the bar.  A good range of craft beers and a fresh menu that offers something a little different.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Get Dorian as your guy.  He has got the skill to make you think have fun and make a difference. He makes dining fun.  Make sure you ask for the BIG D.  Dorian.  Dorian.  Say hey   Kimberly will get you straight.  She makes everything fun.  What a nice evening."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits, menu says with bacon, but arrived with sausage. The sausage was very spicy and took away the savory feel I would have liked with the bacon."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with 8 other people, and we had a mixed experience.  On the high end, the peanut butter and jelly biscuit was truly delicious and delightful.  On the low end, the staff didn't really seem to care whether my friend lived or died.  I'll explain.  Two members of our party are gluten intolerant (one has food sensitivity issues severe enough that he's been hospitalized for them before).  We explained the situation to our waiter and asked which items were gluten-free.  He seemed unsure, and after a bit of discussion, he promised to ask the kitchen and return with a complete list.  He was gone for a while, which we took to mean he was being thorough, as there were about as many occupied tables as there were waiters at the moment.  He came back and asked, \"Everyone ready to order?\"  We responded, \"Uh, we're still waiting on the list of gluten-free items...\" and he politely apologized for not getting that and disappeared again.  He came back and mentioned some items which were gluten-free.  One person asked, \"are the grits gluten-free?\"  To which he replied, \"I think so?  I mean, I'm pretty sure it is.\"  At this point we were annoyed, and one friend calmly explained that you wouldn't carry a grenade around if you were only \"pretty sure\" it wasn't about to explode, so given the health risk, would he please go check with the kitchen.  He came back with another \"whoops\"--turns out it's NOT a gluten free dish, and good thing we didn't just take his word for it.  He then promised to keep in constant contact with the kitchen about the situation to make sure no more slip-ups or miscommunications happen.  One of the two gluten-sensitive people decided at this point to just not order anything and get a meal afterwards, while the more sensitive person was very hungry and figured after 2-3 separate information-sharing trips to the kitchen, things had to be in order by now.  So he ordered the smoked salmon--which the waiter said was definitely gluten-free (no uncertainty, yay)--and the rest of us placed our orders.  At this point we were all starving, as things had been progressing painfully slowly (we would have considered the service slow had the restaurant been crowded; with it practically empty, we didn't know what was going on).  The orders came out.  A bunch of them were wrong.  Mostly minor issues.  A missing ingredient here, an extra ingredient there, one entire entree nobody ordered (one extra is better than one missing, I suppose, though hardly an efficient way to run a business).  But my gluten-intolerant friend noticed something about his smoked salmon, which he had been assured was gluten-free (by a waiter who supposedly checked with the kitchen 2 or 3 times and promised to monitor the situation in the kitchen to make sure no cross-contamination occurred).  THEY SERVED IT ON BREAD.  (Well, a bread product, to be specific, some kind of toast/cracker/bread/crostini/whatever.)  The waiter apologized and offered to have the kitchen make a new one, but at this point no one trusted his word or the kitchen.  So we sat there, the rest of us eating our inaccurately prepared food quickly so our friends could move on to the now-necessary second-brunch of the day (at this point it didn't seem worth reminding anyone that I had said \"no onion\" but still received onion in my so-so omelette).  The waiter apologized again when he brought the check, but I also thought it was odd that we didn't hear anything else about the issue.  No manager came out to apologize, no compensation for trying to poison a customer, not even an explanation of how that could possibly happen (despite how clear we were and how certain we made sure the waiter was) or how they'd make sure it wouldn't happen again.  So yeah, the peanut butter biscuit was delicious.  I still hope they go out of business.  A new restaurant opening up in the same location is the only way I'll ever walk through those doors again."}
{"text":"After coming here once and having an awesome experience with Rich, the bartender, I decided to return with my boyfriend for a late night bite to eat last night (7-31-2015).  The bar was full, so we decided to get a table. The hostess was friendly and accommodating.   The first lady that waited on us (long blond hair) was not very polite at all.  Not only am I hard of hearing to begin with, it was pretty loud in there. I didn't hear a question she asked, and in a very insulting tone, she said: \"I SAID, what would you like to EAT?\"   At first, I assumed she was simply raising her voice in order to make herself audible, but her generally snotty attitude persisted. It seemed like she was having a bad night for reasons not having to do with us, but that it was being taken out on us. We didn't feel very welcome at that point.   We are generally laid-back and understanding people, and have worked in the food service industry, but were unable to excuse her implicit rude gestures, such as a lack of friendliness, overtones of sarcasm, and annoyed facial expressions.  After our food order was taken, another server took over, and she was great (brown hair, glasses)! She really knew her wines, her presentation of our wine was done with utmost professionalism, and she was so friendly!  The truffle fries are amazing. The rosemary aioli has a subdued taste, perfectly balancing out the robust flavor of the fries.  The burgers are huge, juicy, and were cooked perfectly to our requested temps. My boyfriend had the Ten P burger, and I had the traditional one. We each loved our meal.  The Chamisal unoaked Chardonnay has been my favorite Chardonnay out of the 3 I've tried. If you avoid soft after-tastes such as vanilla or creme brulee and aim more for a crisp, drier flavor, this is a good one to try.  I'm only visiting, but I would be happy to return here when I am in Pittsburgh next!"}
{"text":"Nobody who works here actually cares. It's a huge problem. Great space, but the servers clearly don't care about the food and take no pride in doing a good job. Courses come out at vastly different times for people eat the same table. Dirty water glasses! They forget about you, repeatedly. It's hard to like this place, they certainly try to convince you not to."}
{"text":"Eh. That about sums up the brunch experience at ten penny. They do not have many choices for what you would expect for brunch.   I had the omelet and it was subpar. They messed up my order and another persons order at my table and fixed it, but it was still not good. Very bland. Others meals were not that good either. Bloody Mary selection for $10 seems like a pretty good deal. But some tasted very strange with various liquor in them.   Overall, I would not go back for brunch.   Prices are reasonable but for what you get, it would be better to go to eatin park, Pamela's, or even eleven for brunch   Spend more and enjoy your food.  Skip the brunch   Atmosphere is really neat, reason for 2 stars"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my daughter Ten Penny. There was a good crowd at 730 on a Wednesday night.  (Reservations suggested)The interior has a lot of hard surfaces, glass, wood and the noise level reflects that. There is top shelving surrounding with restaurant supplies on it like kosher salt and cans of sauce, kind of a industrial restaurant vibe. Close seating between tables.  We shared an order of mussels. The were cooked perfectly with a garlic sauce. The meat pulled away easily from the shell and was tender.  We followed with salmon and potatoes. The salmon was a generous piece and just the right amount of potatoes.  The server was a nice guy who was attentive and helpful with GF choices"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with 10 ppl! We wanted to reserve the back room, which was a 500 dollar minimum(easily done with 10 ppl eating and drinking!) We were there for 4 hours because the service was so bad. My friends had to get their drinks from the bar, because the waitress was nowhere to be found. Finally, when the food came out it was over cooked where you literally couldn't bite into it or cold.. Not one person was happy with their food. My friends decided to tell the waitress it was my birthday and asked if we can get a dessert and sing happy birthday she said not unless we wanted to buy something from the menu for dessert! After spending well over 500 they couldn't even give u a free dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 5 looking for dinner around 7pm Monday night. Even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded, the service was incredibly slow and disorganized. The server bringing out the food was confused as to which table ordered what food, and 2 of the 5 people in our party were overcharged on their bills.  The food itself was good, but not worth the wait. We finally left an hour and a half after placing our orders."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING!   My husband and I came here for our anniversary at lunchtime about a month ago and can't stop thinking about the food! We are both big foodies and everything was perfect.   We first walked in and we're greeted and sat promptly. We opted for a seat by the window since they were open. They were very accommodating when I asked for some water in a wine glass since I'm pregnant. My husbands drink was amazing (according to him).   Our server however didn't seem to be too thrilled to be there and we almost felt like we were being pushed to finish our meals quickly (although the place was pretty slow)   We had a flatbread for an appetizer and I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the chicken and waffles. Both so good and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ten Penny was fine. Good, even? I like the atmosphere of the place and the location is great. But the food was just ... fine. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Just ... unremarkable. My cocktail, which was a bourbon-based Mule drink (ginger beer and such) was overly sweet and not something I wanted to finish. My fish -- lemon sage ahi tuna -- was decent. My kids seemed to like what they ate just fine. But really, there just wasn't all that much exciting about it. There are so many great places to eat in Pittsburgh that \"fine\" won't do much to bring me back."}
{"text":"Cool lookin bar, had a great hash for brunch but no sides and was still hungry afterwards. They were out of about half of their drafts and some food. I would go back though- I like it"}
{"text":"It was okay. We came here for my birthday dinner because it seems like a \"special occasion\" type of place.   My boyfriend and I got drinks, apps, and entrees. The drinks were great! The app was good - the pulled pork flatbread. The filets were decent but mine was brought out rare when it was supposed to be medium. Not a huge deal and it's an easy fix.   The food wasn't amazing for the price though. There are better places out there."}
{"text":"Decent place.  Was in town for stadium series game. Had a reservation and they were able to sit up early.  Thai chicken flatbread was very good.  We also got a burger and mussels and had no complaints."}
{"text":"We ended up coming here after a pretty awful experience at Sienna Mercato down the block. They were able to seat us in about 10 minutes and our server was phenomenal. Very attentive and sweet. I had an issue with my dish m, and she took care of it right away. The burger was delicious and I'm glad we ended up there. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Truffle beer batter dipped fries with a garlic dripping-so amazing! Traditional burger with fries... Oh may! Add a beer or two... With good friends... Outstanding. 5 dollar drafts 12 dollar burger 8 dollars for an app. Over all not that bad!!"}
{"text":"I've been to place on any number of occasions. Its a favorite for work parties due to its proximity to our office. The quality of the bar area is really quite good. An extensive selection of craft beers and from what my whiskey loving friends say, the dark spirits as well. The setup is nice, and recently we had a client appreciation event in the downstairs club area. The service is always very prompt and friendly. The bar tenders are great and the servers diligent and courteous.   The food though, its really just ok. I've never had anything bad here, but then again, nothing that has really made me say \"wow, great meal\". I've had the burgers several times, and they are cooked to order correctly, and topped with fresh ingredients. The selection is pretty typical though, and I wouldn't take over Tessarro's or BRGR, though would consider superior to Burgatory. Though, maybe just a pet peeve of mine, but the pickle served on the side was really limp and weak. How hard is it to serve a cold, crisp, healthy looking pickle? Its a small detail, but sometimes thats the difference between 3 and 4 stars?"}
{"text":"I just saw Parts Unknown - Pittsburgh last night, I have to say I am so disappointed.... because I was looking forward to hearing more of some fantastic restaurants from Anthony Bourdain, but he did not. I feel like the show has misrepresented the real Pittsburgh restaurants. So I am going to have my version of Parts Unknown - Pittsburgh. Let me start with Ten Penny Restaurant in Downtown. My husband and I visited Pittsburgh two weeks ago. We had a good time though the Steelers did not win when they played with Jacksonville. But I still want to say Go Steelers! Go Penguins!  We had gone to several very good restaurants that week. The last day on 10/9 while we were at Pittsburgh, we decided to check out Ten Penny as it was walking distance from our hotel.  We walked in Ten Penny around noon, we were greeted by the staff right away. The young guy was very nice and polite. He led us to the seat area in the back, it was next to a large window. I like it.  When we were checking out the menu, I have to say I did not expect this is a sort of Cajun food restaurant.  I do like Cajun food, however, it is not easy to find a good one out of New Orleans.  The waiter came over shortly after we looked at the menu, apparently he was training a young guy who seated us. He told us what the special was that day and also gave a few suggestions on what was popular on their menu. He shared a small, friendly conversation with us, and also introduced the young guy he was training.   He was definitely a good coach, and he explained things well with a down to earth attitude, and very funny.  So I decided to start with Bayou Gumbo, wow...it was VERY good. The taste made me think of my experience at K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen. My entry was a Catfish Po-Boy with a side of mixed green salad. Fish was fresh and tasty, bun was newly baked, soft and yummy. Salad was very fresh. The tomato tasted very good, I guess it must be local.  My husband had theTraditional Burger with the side of mixed green salad. He said it was really good, too. The beef was cooked perfectly and he gave 5 star for his burger. I had a bite of the pickle and It was good.  I had a glass of Pinot Grigio (9 ounce), my husband had one Goose island IPA that was very good.  We noticed they had a good selection of beers, but we did not have a chance to try more as we had to catch a flight later to go home. I also want to mention the setup of the restaurant is really cool, the booth is more like southern style. They are leather seats next to the window. The bar area looks very inviting as the tables seem to all come from old sewing machines. It was quite interesting! So overal I gave 5 stars to this place. Good location, good service, good food, good drink, good hours. So what else do we want?! We will go back when we return to the Burgh."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. We were seated right away and we had a great waitress who knew the menu well she was also training someone and the person training was very good. We order calamari and Brussel sprouts as appetizers. The calamari had pickles or jalepano mixed in with it. It was a nice added flavor. The balsamic Brussels with feta cheese I believe were outstanding so full of flavor that is the best a balsamic appetizer I have had ever. For my entree I got the TP burger without bacon. The sauce on the burger it was like a jam really gave the burger great flavor with the egg and beef really married it together. I got the burger medium well and it was juicy and not dry. A lot of times when you order medium well cooks over due it but this one was just right. The desserts looked amazing from what I could see from others but I was too full to try it. The one thing I was disappointed about was that their panini maker was broken so they couldn't have flat breads and I wanted to order that. Maybe when I am in town next I can get that."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say they served this fried chicken and waffles with a side of watermelon to a black man. The dish is supposed to be garnished with strawberries. I'm sure it was just an oversight. Either that or hipster flavored racism. Attached is a pic of the dish and also how it's supposed to come. I'm PISSED"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Ten Penny for awhile. Finally had the opportunity today after attending an event at the convention center.  It was a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was half full. We were greeted and seated by a very nice young man. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come. We realized it was only her, the host, the bartender, and a bus boy working. I don't think they were expecting the over flow from the convention center. The manager was helping to serve.  I loved the interior at Ten Penny. It was very cozy yet you could people watch. I ordered a Pittsburgh Salad and my friend ordered the Green Curry from the \"Late Lunch\" menu. My salad was very good. It had a Spring Mix instead of iceberg lettuce. The French fries were a mix of crispy and fluffy. I'm not a big Ranch dressing fan but I really liked theirs. My friend enjoyed her Green Curry a lot. We both were happy that our flat bottled water was chilled. A lot of places serve it room temperature.  Though our waitress was crazy busy I thought she did a great job and was very friendly. I definitely want to come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"While the decor/ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the food, not so much. I went there for lunch this week and ordered a crab cake sandwich with a side of onion rings. I'm a big fan of crab cake, but this one was so incredibly fishy, I could barely eat it. The amount of salt on the onion rings basically made them inedible, too. I left that day starving, and upset that I spent $23 on food that I couldn't even eat. This place could have potential given its location and the big bar, but do yourself a favor, and don't plan to eat there."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch. I was travelling solo but they didn't judge me. I came in a bit after they opened and no other customers were there but people started coming.   The food was delicious: I had the Pittsburgh Omelet and Banana Fosters Stuffed French Toast, they were both full of flavor and the portions were big. I also had 2 cocktails, and they were both heavy on flavor and alcohol. I highly recommend the Pear and Rosemary.  Staff was friendly and I found the prices reasonable. The decor was very unique yet still inviting.  Literally my only complaint was that the booth seats were really really low, which made eating a bit awkward. If I get a chance to go again I'd try not to sit there."}
{"text":"Please don't go here....I don't even know where to began..... We started with the Crab hushpuppies as an app but it proved to be our first bad decision.  I'm still trying to understand where the crab fits in with this dish.  Fiesta burger (Special) wasn't horrible but was a bit on the dry side.  Not sure if they just cooked the hell out of it or if the mix of meat to fat ratio was just not done well.  Either way, it was mediocre at best.  The PEI mussels were HORRIBLE.  Absolutely no seasoning whatsoever.  The broth was watered down and void of any flavor to accompany the mussels and shrimp.  Potatoes were raw and inedible.  The only component that had any resemblance of flavor was the kielbasa (likely because it was made externally of this establishment).  Kinda felt bad for our waitress as none was her fault as the kitchen screwed her as well as the severely obvious lack of management.  This place is bad and, quite honestly, is not deserving of the three star rating it had when my wife and I were guests.  Its times like these when I wished Yelp would allow half stars on ratings as a full star is grossly overstated for Ten Penny.  Please fellow Yelppers, save your money and time."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner and drinks here before a show one Thursday night a few weeks ago.  We both had a couple of cocktails off of their specialty menu.  They were tasty, but nothing really special in the context of all of the amazing cocktail bars in Pittsburgh right now.  I ended up switching to wine with dinner.  We got the hush puppies as an appetizer as well as the brussel sprouts.  Both were ok.  I got the salmon as my entree and my husband got the meatloaf.  I thought my salmon was pretty good and I was thrilled that they asked me how I wanted it cooked (it's not often that question is asked).  My husband said the meatloaf was good as well.  The reason I give this place a 3 is that it feels like they are trying to walk the line between being hip and being the place to go to happy hour with your coworkers.  Also, trying to appeal to that Pittsburgh crowd with a salad topped with fries...ugh.  We might go back for cocktails if we were in the area, but wouldn't make it a destination."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of the Ten Penny dining experience recently....  The service was EXCEPTIONAL...  The food AMAZING....  The cocktails....DELIGHTFUL  The menu....INTERESTING...  I loved everything about this place....the roomy booth seating. The centralized open bar space, however your dining experience was still relaxed and quiet.   I will certainly return.....and next time I'll make room for dessert!  Ten Penny....well done!"}
{"text":"This is a review focusing on the bar area.  I like the selection of local and craft beers. There were about 10 local beers out of about 20 craft options. The prices are on the expensive side, but this place is trying to attract modern business professionals. The bar tenders are friendly and acknowledge you as soon as you make eye contact with them.  I'd come back for beer and would certainly give the food a shot."}
{"text":"On Thursday evening, 18 December, while waiting for my Amtrak connection (station nearby), I had a beer here after supper.  I'm inclined to give this place 2.5 or 3 stars for service but 5 stars for atmosphere and beer selection -- I settled for an overall rating of 4 stars but probably would have gone with 3.5 stars if it were possible.  The beer selection is extensive and includes 25 or so varieties on draught.  Prices were about as expected for the downtown area of a large city.  I ordered a draught of Troegs Mad Elf; I would have had a couple of more after that, but I was rather full from a large supper next door at August Henry's.  The bartender attended to me fairly quickly, initially, but his speed was adequate and not extraordinary.  However, getting his attention to get a glass of water thereafter was difficult.  I'm sorry if the $1 tip wasn't enough, but I've found in most other places that $1 tip is standard for adequate service, with more generous tips reserved for exceptional service.    Regardless of the mildly poor service, I'd go back there."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of this place, the decor is great, the food and drinks are all very good, and the wait staff for table service, as well as the hostesses here have always been very pleasant. No complaints there.  Pittsburgh needs more places catering to hip crowds, without being stereotypical \"hipster\" - and I think TenPenny accomplishes that incredibly well. Everything in my body says \"love this place!\" except for...wait for it... the bartenders... who leave a really negative impression unfortunately, despite making delicious concoctions.   I give them credit for making great drinks and getting them to customers fairly quickly. But the personalities, quite frankly... and I'm generalizing here based on a few interactions with maybe 2-3 different tenders... suck.  I have been here on a handful of occasions and let me just recap my experiences at the bar specifically... with a handful of quotes and explanations:  -- \"Sweetie,  you're going to have to show some ID\" (I'm 30 - flattered they ask, but be kind please, I'm not a child, nor your sweetie) -- (at 12:45am on a Saturday with a full bar as we walk in) \"Hey it's last call just so you know. We can only serve you one drink but then you gotta leave\" -- Same night, taking candles off the bar to signal to patrons they should skiddaddle... at 1am. Still a full bar. --Same night around 1:15am (bar is about 3/4 full) -- nice couple walks in and comes up next to us to make their way to the bar for a drink order. They're turned down as the tenders tell them they're not taking orders any longer. The couple leaves.  Different night... Me asking for clarification on a drink: \"So it's kinda similar to a Moscow Mule then?\" Bartender: (insert condescending laugh...) \"not at all. So is that what you want?\"  Different night after work - empty tables that were probably reserved for a later event that evening - very crowded bar... I was there with about 6 coworkers. Bartender tells my friend as he serves him a drink that we can't be leaning on the table that's reserved and that we need to stand somewhere else. We complied even though annoyed, and stayed for another hour. The tables still were not in use when we left.  Just ICK.com all around. You can't treat customers as though they're an inconvenience OR like you're better than them. It won't get you far. Bartenders can make or break a bar scene, and unfortunately each time I leave this place I wonder \"why do I keep coming back?\"  What makes a place LAST is their people.  I keep hoping the next time will be better. I plan to go back for dinner service (again, always great), but I think I should probably stop going to the bar.... would recommend others consider the same.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Exciting to visit this place for the first time but we left with some disappointment.  We are dining with another couple who are making their first visit to the restaurant as well.  The hostess greets us and sits us right away near a very large party.  So large that it took around 15 minutes for our server to greet us and to inform us that he has a large party as well.  After reading through the wine list he tells me that I need to pick 3 or 4 different wines because they are out of around 1/2 of the list.  Which leads me to a question why have such a list if you are only able to keep 1/2 of it available?  We pick two wines which are not available, so he takes the issue up with the manager and is able to get us a wine which is more expensive at a lower price.  So the server gets an A+ for making the extra effort.  After a while, he comes back to take our food order and I jokingly ask if everything on the menu is available, and much to my surprise he rattles off 5-6 items that are not available.  Including no scallops for my wife's shrimp and scallop risotto so it was shrimp risotto instead.  Tasting the food and thinking about the meal overall it was very good.  Holding back the star rating is the poor service and missing items on the menu and wine lists.  If you are only going to stock 1/2 wine list, reprint the wine list.  How can you run out of your standard menu items?  And if your server has a large party to care for, don't give him another table of four."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait until I ate here a few times to leave a review. Personally, since I live downtown, I love it. It's convenient, good food, decently priced. I've come twice for brunch and once for dinner. At brunch, I've had the Ten Penny Hash and Chicken and Waffles. At dinner, I had the Blackened Catfish. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the chicken and waffles didn't live up to my expectations. It was okay - I was expecting it to taste better since the Ten Penny Hash and Catfish were soooooo good. I've had a lot of chicken and waffles, and this wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. I've always had great customer service here and drinks have always been great. Since it's down the street from where I live, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I always have fun here and the food is above average compared to other bars. But for some reason everytime I come here the waiter/waitress messes with the order. Something to improve."}
{"text":"Terrible. Only get a second star because I had a good glass of scotch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere evoking old warehouse feel. Nice large wine pours. Yummy appetizers. We had the meatball and Brussels sprouts. Yum. Also had wedge salad. Overall we give thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful and I loooove the decor. I just wished the food lived up to the space.   We had crispy brussel sprouts and calamari for appetizers. The Brussels were delicious, but the calamari was horribly over cooked.   For the entree I ordered the chicken piccata. Disclaimer: I LOVE chicken piccata and my boyfriend's is hard to beat. What came out confused me. Why is there a cream sauce with capers in it on my chicken?! Why does this chicken look deep fried instead of pan fried?! I held out hope that the flavors would make up for this \"interesting\" take on the dish. No, no, and NO. I only had a few bites. The chicken was so chewy and dry it wasn't really edible.   Our cocktails were decent, but I couldn't get over my $26 entree being that subpar.  I doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Its pretty obnoxious to specify a gluten-free order and still receive your 'lettuce sandwich' with two BEER battered onion rings on top. While you're re-training the staff on food allergies, please also consider re-vamping the GF menu as well. It contains no descriptions, no ingredients (for other potential allergens) and no pricing."}
{"text":"Food was great, place was really cool looking and clean, and lots of drink options. Went here for dinner tonight it was are first time, we got there around 8 place was busy but not overly busy. The service was kinda slow only one plate and cup on the table even though the reservation was for 2. Waitress seemed to have a bad attitude but by the end of the we realized she was dealing with a table of obnoxious drunks. But other than that great place, different menu, lots of good drinks, clean bathrooms (always a plus) and a fun atmosphere for the whole family."}
{"text":"I meet a friend for lunch today at Ten Penny. What a pleasant time! The place wasn't very crowded at all which was inducive for conversation. With the weather being nice the windows were removed offering an open feel to the dining area and the atmosphere inside had a comfortable yet rustic feel to it. Our waitress was courteous and professional.  It didn't take long for us to decide on what we wanted. My friend ordered the special of the day, some sort of flatbread with sausage and I went with the Cuban Reuben. I took a quick gander at the drink menu for a possible future happy hour outing and noticed that there was a wide variety of drinks and wines, if that's your thing, along with enough craft beers to keep things interesting for me.   Our plates arrive quickly; maybe five minutes or so.  My sandwich was very good with a good portion of pulled pork under the slaw and melted swiss cheese on a warm and slightly toasted baguette. I was treated to a little sample of my friend's flatbread and it was equally delicious. For a restaurant being in the Cultural District and for the quality of the meal that we enjoyed, I'd say the total amount of the check was very reasonable. The tab even came with a little chocolate \"coin\" that had \"Ten Penny\" imprinted on the gold foil wrapper... nice added touch.  From my experience I can't see any reason why Ten Penny doesn't deserve a five star rating.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Downtown lunch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...will be fabulous in warmer weather when they can open the big paneled windows around the perimeter.   Food was good, two of us shared the cheese plate ($15), mega meatball ($10), and BBQ Chicken Flatbread. Taste was average, flatbread overdone, cheese plate just okay...meatball delicious!   Drinks were great...can't wait to go back non pregnant and really explore the drink menu but it looked yummy!   Bathrooms clean and spotless for a Friday night.   Great great vibe!  Comfort level - the big booths along the windows have really strange seats...I felt very far say from the table and had to sit on the edge of my seat which caused the cushion to pop up behind me...just awkward. Tables are stationary so you can't move it closer to you.   Overall, I would go back and definitely recommend. Like I said it has a great atmosphere and drinks!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ten Penny a few times but only for dinner. My friends and I decided to go to brunch there this past weekend before a show. We were all disappointed. I ordered the eggs Benedict and added a crab cake. The English muffin was so tough that I could barely cut through it. The crab cake was good but really small. For $22, I was hoping for a half way decent sized meal but that wasn't the case. They also had no brunch drink specials. The service was mediocre as well. I would go back to Ten Penny but probably only for drinks since I do enjoy the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"My niece and I went to Ten Penny before a show at the Bennedum. This was the first time going to this restaurant, I made a reservation and from the moment we walked in the door we were treated special. Immediately we were seated in a fantastic booth which is elevated above the main dining area. The restaurant is a soft industrial style and beautifully decorated. Our waitress Susanna was very attentive and a very skilled waitress. The salmon dinner I had was delicious and cooked perfectly. When the check arrived I was pleasantly surprised. All the wonderful atmosphere, service and price made this one restaurant I will return to."}
{"text":"Quality is going downhill, especially considering the exorbitant prices. From previous pictures, it seems the S'mores Dip dessert comes with a variety of housemade shortbread cookies, but my order came with generic Walkers' shortbread cookies. They also neglected to inform me that they'd run out of the chocolate graham crackers promised on the menu (after trying to order two other desserts that they had also run out of) since they were making changes to the menu. Chocolate cheesecake dip was clearly just cream cheese and cocoa powder.  Chicken and waffles - half a weirdly spicy (it was cheddar and some unspecified pepper) waffle with two small chicken wings (made largely up of bone) that weren't even properly made. The outside was oily and slightly soggy rather than crisp.  Two months ago I had the Hawaiian stuffed french toast, which was amazing with its pineapple cream cheese and coconut crust. Shame nothing here is that great anymore.  I could make better food at home compared to what's being served now. Cook (doubtful that he or she is a chef) should be replaced."}
{"text":"This is one of the more attractive looking casual dining venues downtown. Located near the DL Lawrence Convention center, it is convenient for lunch or later dining; I've done both. The waitstaff is consistently pleasant and attentive, and the food is reasonably priced.  One thing you just have to try. The basalmic glazed brussel sprouts. Seriously...even if you hate veggies in general and sprouts in particular, try them. They are only on the evening menu (argh, because I was there early today), and delicious. Uber good. In and of themselves worth a trip. That good. We had a nice stop today - me and 2 kids, after attending the car show at the convention center. If there is any downsides, I'd suggest the kitchen pay a little closer attention to some details. The fries for the kids were salty seasoned to excess. Chicken tenders a bit overdone, but the other's burger was just right. My Pittsburgh salad with steak was too big for the amount of rather runny blue cheese dressing that accompanied it, but it was fresh and good otherwise. Our server - Kaylen (sp) - was terrific. Knew her stuff, friendly and she charmed the boy's (10 and 11 year olds). Very well done. I really like this place. Been here a few times, and never disappointed. Minor stuff not worth a sweat. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here was... Meh. Coffee was honestly terrible. Server forgot our silverware so we just took them off another table. Pittsburgh biscuit was ok. Coffee and doughnuts was decent. Expected better."}
{"text":"I think expectations are set high for Ten Penny because it is surrounded by several other great spots and because of it's great location, atmosphere, and layout.   I have eaten there twice and both times the seating and service was a bit on the slow side.  More important, the food was so-so.  Granted I had a burger once and chicken the other time.  My wife had a cuban sandwich that failed to live up the hype on the menu.  On the positive, reasonable prices.  I will go back, but maybe just for drinks."}
{"text":"The whole bar and restaurant area is very nice, industrial and modern.  Unfortunately the positives stop there.  I have been there 3x now and the service has stunk every time.  I'm not sure why they can't get competent wait and bar staff.  Our drinks were off, the appetizers were supremely underwhelming, and we were too scared off at that point to order entrees.  The poor waiter we had (who was average on his best day) had way too many tables.  We were there for a good 15 minutes before we even got waters.  Cocktails took another 20 minutes.  Appetizers came out on time but were average at best (think Applebee's).    I could go on but I won't.  We left in a \"huff\" because we were able to secure reservations at a competing place around the corner.  The entire restaurant is packed with potential.  There's no reason why it's not a hot place on Penn.  Management needs to be put under the microscope.  Everything trickles down from there...."}
{"text":"Not awful. Not terrible. Just A-OK.  My friend and I stopped here before a show on a Tuesday.  We got a table right away and told our server that we had a show to go to so would just want to order food that would come out the fastest, so probably just an appetizer. We love flatbread so the appetizer flatbread was something that caught our eyes. The waiter assured us that it would come out fast and so we proceeded to order it. It was legit just a margarita pizza and it was AMAZING. Granted, we were starving and needed something quickly but this pizza was great. I think we wished we ordered two just so we could have our own.   I will say that the three stars have more to do with the food not coming out as fast as we would like and that our server kinda disappeared once we told him that we would be only ordering one thing and no drinks. It was fine, I guess, since we didn't need much else but still.   I would hope to come back and maybe sample more things on the menu and maybe see if I can adjust this review. I like the location, the decor, but I need to try it again to maybe see if this would be a place I would want to take people or come back again."}
{"text":"When a restaurant's most interesting offering is a burger, and it's not a a place that specializes in them, a reviewer is tempted to lop off at least one or two stars or avoid them completely, but in this case, doing either would be a grave error. Ten Penny's eponymous burger is worth paying to park in a garage for.   Fortunately for us one lazy, culinarily-challenged weeknight after work, Kay and I happened to be within reasonable walking distance from her employer's complimentary lot. I'd remembered that Ten Penny was a new competitor in the Downtown Pittsburgh dining scene and convinced my significant other to make the trek, but that's not important. Let's discuss the burger.   I didn't want to order one (I go to burgers too often), but the other entrees just weren't quite piquing my interest. Besides, working in a physical job gives a guy a craving for the glorified steaks, and this was not only glorified, it was rarefied, literally and figuratively.   Let's muse about the doneness, something TP's crack cooks NAILED. If you want an ideally pink and juicy slab of sizzling chopped meat, this is where you need to be, and the Ten P Burger needs to be in front of you. The cuts of meat, whatever they may have been (I'm guessing sirloin and chuck at least), that comprised this burger were treated with utmost reverence.   And the fixin's are fierce. A sunny fried egg straddles the patty obscenely like a blond stripper on a muscled athlete. Watercress, a surprise component, adds freshness and crunchy texture. Bacon, an almost unwritten essential topping, brings the fat and the brine. Tomato plays its obligatory role well while a red onion jam upstages all else with its smoky, caramelized, aromatic essence. Wilted cheddar nips the palate playfully as an medley of pickled vegetables snaps the entire thing in the ass. Seldom ever satisfied with a burger sans mayonnaise, I requested to have bacon rosemary aioli, something that came with our appetizer, the Truffled French Fries, slathered onto the top half of that toasted, spongy bun to make it unrepentantly unctuous, and while I use that word sparingly, this burger spared nothing. Nouveau rich, it was Ric Flair strutting into a Las Vegas nightclub treating all patrons to drinks. Imagine excess personified on a plate.   Since we'd ordered the fries to share, I instead chose the Mixed Greens salad as my side dish with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette. Lettuce, pickled radish, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, Kalamata olives, carrots, and tomatoes proved to be orchestral, the crispy pepitas providing the percussion as my taste receptors were cleansed between bites both leafy and beefy  The brittle yet fluffy and therefore deftly prepared fries themselves almost reached the decadent heights of the burger with their truffle oil, shaved parmesan, and roasted garlic plucking wild, ambrosial, exotic, nutty, sweet strings betwixt the teeth and on the tongue, the aforementioned aioli furthering this affair down the primrose path to ruin. A drunken banker would be very pleased with this at midnight and incensed that a pleb like myself would be enjoying it alongside him.    From elsewhere on the rest of TP's relatively stodgy carte, I managed to steal a bite of Kay's Seared Duck Breast which comes with Jasmine rice, gingered carrot puree, baby bok choy, and a saba glaze, the bird itself calling to mind an extremely supple, honey-baked ham if I'm to be believed.   Dessert for the lady was the somewhat mild-mannered Chocolate Pretzel Torte. One taste reminded me of a softened, gently sugary biscotti, the hazelnut mousse that topped it providing a modicum of confectionery heft. While tempting enough, I was looking for a more risque item and found it in the Peanut Butter Cookie.   Other restaurants have similar desserts, Burgatory being one of them (the defunct Gullifty's Killer Kookie For Two is your father...), but TP's blend of white, milk, and bittersweet chips gives it a distinct flavor, especially when baked and served in a cast iron pan to ensure buttery crumbly edges. Salty and saccharine smacked into each other on a platter of golden dough, the fine housemade vanilla ice cream foiling the heat and a somewhat limp hot fudge almost acting as a wallflower.  Ten Penny's interiors resemble a warehouse converted into a cozy, upscale loft. We felt as if we were house-sitting for a young, single advertising executive as we noshed on bar food that had no right to be as regal as it was. Leather seats like those found in a psychiatrist's office can be found in the booths. Shelves with bottles of oils and jars of pasta stand against whitewashed brick walls. A stark, metallic, beaconing \"P\" glows above the front door. You'll feign prestige for 90 minutes.   Upon paying our tab, we headed out and spoke to the tall, strapping host who probably doubles as a bouncer. \"You look like you earned it,\" he told me as he laughed. \"Indeed I did,\" I replied. It had been a rough one after all."}
{"text":"We went to Ten Penny for a bachelorette party and I really enjoyed the decor and quite atmosphere. Very antique industrial meets modern feel to it all so it was nice to look around while we were there.   Our server was a little busy but he tired hard to be attentive for our group. We got the calamari which had a sweet, honey like sauce we all loved but the portion size for the appetizer was really small. We also got a flat bread which was decent sized and tasted very fresh with basil, tomatoes, garlic and good olive oil all over it.   I got the pork chop entree with asparagus and whipped potatoes and I was really glad I got it. It was one of the larger meals our server said and we girls were all starving. Everyone else got meals that were more expensive but had less on them and that was due to being seafood or filet. Overall I had enough food to fill me up and I didn't have to have a salad or dessert to do that.   Will definitely be taking my husband to this restaurant since the decorating and culinary styles are right up our alley."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place for dinner on a chilly Saturday night. We felt the warmth of the restaurant right when we walked in and were brought to our table with two comfortable leather couches that provided more than enough room for the two of us.   We were really in the mood to just order appetizers for our meal: cider braised pork belly (great taste, just wish it were a little more fatty), crispy calamari (yum), 1 lb. steamed PEI mussels (good, comes with garlic toast on top), and truffled French fries (good, comes in a pretty big portion with two sauces). These four appetizers filled us up and we even had some leftovers of fries!   Great atmosphere. Wooden ceilings, brick walls, and dozens of lights hanging from the ceiling in the main area. Pretty large bar area.   One note about service. Our server was fine for the most part, but we did notice that he seemed a little down. Not sure if that was just his personality or if he was having a less-than-ideal day. Regardless, it was still a good meal!   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Lots of changes to the menu. They removed a drink that my girlfriend looked and several menu items she liked as well. Service left something to be desired. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurant experiences of my lifetime! Awesome experience and atmosphere!   First was the servers. They all seemed to work as a team in everything they do! Once we were seated, they helped us pick the best thing to get on the menu. I ordered the macaroni and cheese with truffle oil! TO DIE FOR! For my entrée I had the salmon with warm potato salad and orange sauce! Best fish I had ever had! Who said that the best fish came from the coast?   The service was just amazing. The waitresses were so easy to get along with. They even offered me a job... when I'm 18! lol The food came out steaming hot in less than 15 minutes. I will definitely go back soon, and I will spread the word for more people to go there! Please go here! One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at this restaurant , the waitress was friendly!   We had the flatbread it was amazing!   I also had there Potato Soup and Salad and enjoyed it!   The Decor is trendy!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Having a hard time believing there's a 15 min wait when there are multiple empty tables. Hostess was incredibly snarky. No idea if we'll stay or not but you'd think the owners would want to offer guests a warmer welcome. I guess not. Business must be that amazing in Pitt. Happy for them. Zero recos coming."}
{"text":"Had lunch there trying something different.  Everyone in my group of five enjoyed their meal. I had the braised brisket sandwich with onion rings.  The brisket was very tender and flavorful.  The onion rings were real, not made with diced onions.  Our server was pleasant and professional.  Even those who didn't serve us were pleasant.  I would definitely recommend Ten Penny and look forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Erica is the best!  Wonderful customer service and great food. I will definitely be coming back for lunch. Glad that I decided to try something new."}
{"text":"Nice, energetic setting but very lackluster food at a high price. It seemed very lively on a Friday night, and it had an expansive drink menu and great variety at the bar. However, the food was nothing special, especially the vegetarian options. They were minimal in option, and the available options were uncreative and bland. It's frustrating when a restaurant basically only offers salad, a risotto, and a pasta primavera as the vegetarian options....so boring! Not sure if the meat options were any more inspired. Would definitely come here again simply for drinks, but the food menu isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Mediocre everything. Went there for brunch. The atmosphere is nice especially when the windows are all open. Our server was extremely slow and we had to keep asking for refills of water and coffee. The hash was really good, but a little on the salty side. I also ordered the short rib biscuit sliders and there was no horseradish aioli on them so I had to ask for it which took a long time to get. The Bloody Mary was disappointing and my Bellini had pulp in it...usually it comes strained, so I thought. Anyway, I won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts are drowned in the terrible sauce. Waited 30 mins for a filet that never came. Plenty of seats at the bar and open tables. Not sure why they forgot about my food."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start.  Great food, service, location and drinks. Visiting the Pittsburgh area for a weekend getaway from Jersey. We stumbled upon this place using a Google search and couldn't have been happier. This place has amazing drinks and the food was beyond amazing.  I'm a big seafood person and calamari is a must as an appetizer but was told via comments to stir clear of the calamari so I went with the Mussels which were just ok for me. The wine sauce I believe was a little bland but the mussels were cooked well. The drinks we ordered were extremely strong and delicious so that made up for the appetizer.  My entree was freaking AMAZING being a noodle guy. I was completely thrown off when I saw this on the menu so next trip I'm definitely getting this again.  Overall great experience. Word to the wise make sure you make a reservation unless you arrive early before the evening rush. We arrived around 6:30-7:00 so we didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"First let me start off with what I didn't like, food was not hot, waitress had a bad attitude wouldn't crack a smile, if there was champagne in the mimosa not only could I not taste it I couldn't see, it looked like a glass of oj.  With all this negativity you are probably wondering how I could rate it 4 stars, the bernaise sauce was the best I ever had! I mean this was lick the plate amazing! Also I am a vegetarian and the chef made the ten penny hash for me with no brisket.  I cannot stress enough how incredible the eggs benefict were.   We were moved to a different table which gave us the miserable waitress, at the first table Dane was our original waiter who was totally delightful and I would ask for him next time I go and I will definitely go again.  I will just order a glass of wine:)"}
{"text":"Ambience was great, love the industrial/steampunk decor.   Drinks were good, nice pours on our vodka drinks.  Service was good, very engaging and attentive waitress.   It was hot AF in the restaurant and there were no open outside tables, can't fault them totally because Pittsburgh is humid AF.   Food... food was very good all except for one thing. Do. Not. Order. The. Kale. It comes as a side with the panko crusted chicken, sub it out, for the love of God SUB IT OUT!  I've never been a fan of vegetables, it wasn't until later in life that I learned that vegetables are in fact grown in the ground and not manufactured in cans. Thanks, Mom. Who knew that vegetables could be crisp and flavorful?  Anywho, the \"kale\" was a lump of dark green mush with a horrible bitter flavor. We asked the waitress if it was canned, her manager assured her it was fresh. The waitress even commented that she always wondered why customers always left the \"kale\" on their plates after dinner... (cuz it's not kale) If it was in fact fresh, they must have boiled it for about 3 days. The lady at the table next to us didn't eat her \"kale\" either.   I'd definitely go back, their brussels sprouts appetizer and our meals were very good, minus that drain clogger they called \"kale.\""}
{"text":"Eight open tables, but couldn't seat us. It was our last choice on the block listed on Yelp, but fortunately we were welcomed with open arms to August Henry's, 2 doors down. Menu actually looks better. As a person in business for myself, I'll never understand this kind of thing. Offer something promising, even if it's a wait. No wonder they were empty with 3 star rating. Sad."}
{"text":"Nice modernish hep spot where the young peoples meets for the drinkz and nouveau appetizerzes. Service was overly attentive, perhaps in an attempt to get my rather salubrious companions to quadruple-down on drinks, but who can blame a server for going for the tip trifecta, eh? I stuck with appettizers, as the plates are more than a bit expensive, and had a perfectly nice mediterranean 'pizza' and shared a few other things, all of which were well executed if not horribly original. The proximity to the convention center in a bit of a desert for night options is a major plus. Recommended if you're on an expense account."}
{"text":"Came for drinks and bites after work.  I had the sparkling brut wine priced at $8 per glass, and was told they were $5 for happy hour. I was still charged $8 per glass...  I ordered the truffle fries to munch on, but they tasted/looked like they came from your local grocery store's freezer...."}
{"text":"I've not gone to Ten Penny four time since it opened, and each experience has been incredibly mediocre except for the last one which was much worse.   Nothing on the menu is especially great. I'm not sure exactly what they're going for but plenty of sandwiches just seem better-than-chain where they try and make up for quality with quantity.   During my last visit the notoriously bad service hit a new low. The checks they brought us were incorrect to begin with, and then once corrected and the cards taken they charged the wrong bills to the wrong cards. Each time we had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find someone to help us. They were not speedy in fixing it. Afterwards, I sent a message using their Contact Us link about the experience but of course never heard back.   It's not possible to go to this place during lunch on a normal day, and when they're off you'll be there closer to two."}
{"text":"Went to Ten Penny for brunch two weeks ago with my husband and brother-in-law. We decided to come when I saw carrot cake pancakes on the menu. I'm a HUGE fan of carrot cake! Both my husband and I ordered it and were very satisfied. The spice of carrot cake with the sweetness of pancakes, perfect balance and very filling. My BIL got a burger, which looked amazing and he was very pleased, both with it and the fries. The boys got two beers each and enjoyed the beer selection. Being preggers I did not get a drink-drink. I did ask our waitress if the coffee was \"worth it\" as I can only have 12 oz of coffee a day, and it WAS worth it. A very strong, rich cup of coffee perfect for brunch.   I also love that their flatware is monogrammed, just a nice touch. Overall a cool atmosphere that didn't feel like it was trying to hard, and the staff were attentive, but not too fake-cheery.   We are definitely coming back to check out their dinner service. From perusing the online menu I'm looking to try the Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Seafood Red Curry."}
{"text":"My friends and I have created a group called \"Burgh Brunchers\" and have been trying places all over the city!    Had a great time here with friends and family!  The atmosphere of this place is very trendy and laid back - I love the industrial feel of it.  Definitely would like to try it for dinner or drinks at night.  The Bloody Mary bar was pretty extensive - however I was a little disappointed at the lack of bacon.  I got the Veggie Omelet, which was good but a little on the dry side, and it came with a hearty serving of potatoes!  My friend ordered the Brown Sugar Grits which I would highly recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth!  Also our server was John who was fantastic! :)   #brunchsohard"}
{"text":"Out of twelve people at dinner, no one really liked their meal, and several of us had dishes that were barely edible."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a snack and drink, so ordered a glass of zin and deviled egg trio appetizer.  Wine was standard and drinkable but deviled egg trio for $9 was a complete disappointment.  Two eggs (chives & truffled) had none of the flavors described in menu.  Description should have been \"garlic powdered and stale\"  The remaining salmon egg was the favored of the trio, with a hint of smoked salmon taste."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Pittsburgh Home and Garden show for a quick drink that could've turned into a meal.  This place is cool, by that, I mean the decor and design. There is a lot of eye catchers around the room. We got seated at a table near the bar and felt like we were on top of the party next to us. With how the room is designed, it's LOUD. Not the best ambiance for conversations. After some wait, a server finally came over and asked what we wanted to drink. They had a decent cocktail menu. A friend got the Dirty Pickle and I had the Daly Dose. Both very good!  All we were given was a late night/snack menu at 4 pm... Wasn't sure if that was for a happy hour... we weren't told about it was. So the cocktails were a plus, service was a dud.  With all the other fabulous options for dinner near by, we decided to move on to hear each other talking. Can't say I'm running back, something was missing for me."}
{"text":"Ten Penny is amazing.  Great atmosphere, great beer selection, top notch service and amazing food.  I had the Truffle Mac & Cheese, Bacon Wrapped Brussel Sprouts, Filet & Creme Brulee Sampler and everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great time here, the food was great and the drinks are even more amazing. We had Drew as a bartender and he was just the best! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here four times in three days and there are plenty of places to eat downtown, but this place does it right!  Was in town for the big race and had bookmarked this place after reading Darren W's 5-star review.  Came in on a Friday night and there were tables open but they said it would be 45 minutes to be seated.  We figured they must have been understaffed and just went somewhere else (and found out later that had been the case).  Came back Saturday afternoon for a couple of beers and sat at the bar.  The bartenders were cool, helpful and friendly.  My friend and I loved the vibe so we made reservations for brunch on Sunday after the race.    The place was packed on Sunday and our super waitress said the bar was a bit backed up, but we were tired and hungry and had no other plans, so we said \"no problem.\".  Libby was a dynamite waitress and everything that followed was great too.  I got a Bloody Mary flight, which was very interesting.  I liked the original best but I was glad for options.  We started with the smoked salmon, which was delicious (although you should provide four crostini if you have four pieces of salmon, IMO) and really raised my appetite.  We both had the breakfast flatbread which must be the world's greatest invention ever.  Perfectly done, in a human size portion, it wasn't as heavy as it sounded with sausage gravy, meat, onions and egg on it.  It was spectacular and I'm drooling now thinking about it.  It was a great meal.    Then Sunday evening, after having an unsatisfactory experience at Sienna Mercato (which looks like it could be cool if anyone actually waited on tables there), we were back at Ten Penny for dinner.  We had burgers and pizza (along with some beers) and again, it was great service, delicious food and a fun time.  I will definitely return to Ten Penny when I'm back in the 'burgh.  This is one of those places I would like to airlift intact to NYC and drop it on a nearby corner so I could go there regularly."}
{"text":"I came here on a date on Friday night and we were not that impressed. We sat at the bar which didn't really have many people at it and the service was abysmal. No one came over to us for at least 8-10 minutes and brought waters but didn't ask our drink orders. We decided to order food about 40 minutes into being there and again...food brought out with no silverware or anything. Standard steak salad...nothing stellar. My date had a tiny burger.   No one checked on us. We couldn't flag anyone down for the bill to leave for a scheduled event. Just won't be back. I wouldn't be surprised if this place went out of business in a year."}
{"text":"Ten Penny has SO much potential, which is why it pains me so much to write a two star review. The location is great, the decor is phenomenal, but the food and service fall short.  I came to Ten Penny for dinner on a weeknight before a show. The location is prime in the Cultural District, and I have to say - as soon as I walked in, I was very impressed. The hip decorations, high ceilings, and spacious dining area had me smitten. Unfortunately the dining experience just did not match the quality of the decor.  Prices are high, and the quality of the food was just subpar. I ordered a Caesar salad and a cup of the potato soup. I enjoyed both, but I felt that there was truly nothing special about them. I tasted a few of the dishes that my friends ordered and was not wowed by those either. I wish I had more to say, but in my opinion, there are much better food options in the Cultural District for these prices.  The service is what really drives me to give Ten Penny only two stars. Our waitress was nice and upbeat, but there were issues everywhere. Some of our girls ordered glasses of wine and were presented with a different type than ordered. When our food arrived, two girls ended up being left without entrees. They tried to explain to us that there was an error with the computers, but I felt terrible for the girls that had to wait even longer for their meals. At the end of the night, every single one of our checks was incorrect. I wish I was exaggerating. Many of the drinks we ordered were supposed to be on happy hour special, and all eight of our checks had to be adjusted before we paid.  I hope Ten Penny makes some changes, because this could be a restaurant with very high potential if they improve the food and the service (or at the very least, lower the prices)."}
{"text":"I had a good time with friends here ! Bartending is quick and made my drinks the way i wanted them !"}
{"text":"A-OK restaurant.  I would go again if invited.  Went there for dinner with a friend the other night. I approached this with some skepticism given the very poor reviews that I have read in yelp for this establishment, but I was a guest so I didn't say anything.  Tenpenny is located across the street from the Westin convention center hotel and has convenient valet parking in front of the building.    We went in and I noticed as we walked through the bar area that it's a very cool space--definitely five stars--and there was a really large after-work crowd enjoying drinks there. I would definitely give it high marks as a place to meet after work for happy hour, or meet up with a friend, or to go on a date, or maybe even to find a date. There did seem to be a little bit of a meat market action going on.  We were seated at a booth toward the back of the bar-I think it would be a little loud if you were closer to the bar area-and reviewed the menu.  Good, solid bar menu with some interesting items on it. I got the Arctic char on a bed of lentils.  Solid A-ok (3 stars)  Waitress was excellent. I think my favorite touch was that she had already taken care of my guests parking validation without even having to be asked. He pulled it out she said \"I already took care of it\" I just like that touch. She's very friendly and really knew the menu and was on top of our order the whole time. So important. I read the other reviews and the complaints about the service and I think that's really unfortunate. I hope this means the management got the message and took care of things. My view of things was the people were pretty on the spot with everything.  My one beef was that I asked for nonalcoholic beer and they didn't have one. I think every bar should have nonalcoholic beer as an option. Some of us don't drink alcohol but we still enjoy the taste of beer.  The waitress admitted that she's had several others ask for nonalcoholic beer and had to give the same reply. I ended up drinking soda water all evening which probably is free--Therefore they lost additional money that they could've made if they weren't so snotty about it. (2 stars)"}
{"text":"I went with my family and we got their pancakes and a beef skillet. The pancake was incredibly salty and dry. The waitress dropped my toast on the floor and said oops lost the toast and never replaced it and didn't apologize. I won't be coming back here and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch at 1pm with 7 of my coworkers. We came at an off hour, hoping that we could grab a quick bite to eat and be on our way.   Service was HORRIBLE. There were only a few other busy tables in the restaurant but it still took them around 45 minutes to make our food. We tried to reiterate that we were in a hurry but it fell on deaf ears. They even got 2 of our orders wrong.   Mediocre food with poor service. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Not sure how u can mess up truffle fries! Still waiting for my salt and pepper... And had to request an itemized bill???  Has potential but someone really needs to re-analyze the menu and make sure it describes what ur going to get. Manager was on top of things but needs to train staff to be self sufficient."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for dinner. They seated us at a table in the bar, next to a large open door (window the width of three doors). This is at night, in November, with the wind blowing. I asked for a table further from the cold, and they said they had reservations coming in for the other tables.  They wouldn't close it because there was a party at the table on the sidewalk. It was a family with a dog.  I think they should have declined to seat someone outside in November, when it would freeze other patrons out. Or treated our reservation as well as they did the others. I heard other people complaining, too.  If we hadn't needed to get to a theatre soon, I would have walked out."}
{"text":"Recently we went to Ten Penny for our friends Birthday. With a large party we were all comfortably seated so we could converse. Our waiter was very attentive to our party, even though he had multiple tables. The wine selection, although kind of pricey, was very detailed and deep. The Smith and Hook Cab-Sav was pretty good. I ordered the Pork Chip Entree served with whipped potatoes and Asparagus. The Pork was cooked PERFECTLY! The seasoning on the pork chop was just enough to add flavor, but not over powering. For dessert I was split between the Smores and the seasonal ice cream.  I got both, and they were good. The presentation of the Smores was pretty interesting. You got all the parts as well as a flaming cauldron to make your own Smores!! The 3 for 5 was a great deal and could've been for two. I would definitely suggest Ten Penny for lunch, dinner, or a late night spot. Ten Penny Hit The Pot!"}
{"text":"The drinks are great, the service is great....but the food is TERRIBLE. Do yourself a favor and only go for drinks!"}
{"text":"I loved having brunch here!  They have delicious raspberry almond cinnamon rolls! They weren't very cinnamon-y but they were more like sweet rolls. They were sweet and very good! The three of us shared them.   I had the strawberry lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd and lemon syrup. They were so good! They had lots of lemon taste and the sliced strawberries on top were perfect. My brother got the Hawaiian French toast stuffed with pineapple cream cheese topped with coconut. It was very cheesy tasting and a little overwhelming. It was very sweet but still tasty! My brother's boyfriend had the breakfast flatbread. It was delicious. Very savory taste and features cheese, sausage, potatoes and gravy.   Our waitress was very helpful and super courteous. She kept offering to refill the hot water for our tea and was very attentive.   I would love to come back here to try something new!"}
{"text":"Walking in you know you are in for a treat.  The space is beautiful and rustic with an absolutely gorgeous etched in metal sign for the restaurant.  It has a beautiful rustic glow from the different light fixtures and an enormous bar that even when full wasn't too loud for us to be able to hear each other above.   Went here last night for dinner with a group of five which started with us having to call and ask if we could push back our reservation by an hour and they assured us it was no problem.   There seemed to be a question about where they where going to seat us once we got there, but they where able to make a high top table work. I hope in the future to go back and try one of their comfy looking booths!  Service was a bit disjointed. It seemed as though we had to ask a bit for everything (like more water and for a bread basket), but overall food was served at a steady pace and was coursed out as we asked for it to be.   The food was delicious! We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share and where very happy with our choices.   What we sampled:  Seared Gnocchi:  The texture was perfection. Light and airy, yet filling and rustic with the wild mushrooms and watercress.   Crispy Brussels Sprouts: Out of this world delicious. The blue cheese was not overpowering even though there where some sizeable chunks throughout.  So good!  Roasted Wild Mushroom Flatbread: Good. Out of all of the things we ordered this was the least favorite, but not because it was bad, it was just that everything else was so good!  Hot Rocks: We chose three proteins, scallop, tuna, and american kobe(wagyu).  This was very novel and fun for sharing. All of the proteins where delicious and only enhanced by the accompaniments especially the sweet soy which we kept and dunked the other food into because it was so delicious!   Truffled Fries: So good we had to order two. Absolutely out of this world! The bacon rosemary aioli was delicious and the truffle flavor was perfect and not overwhelming.   We also had a few drinks which everyone was happy with and enjoyed immensely which included the Antioxidant, Rose's Old Fashioned, and the Prickly Pear Margarita!  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the space first. Gorgeous! They really know how to design a hip and trendy joint. Exposed beams, hanging industrial lights and shelves of spices. Very cool. Definitely very similar to their sister restaurant, Local, but better.  We came in on a snowy Sunday, so it wasn't very busy. I note that because we waited quite a bit for the cheese plate we ordered first. That was a bit confusing because you wouldn't think a cheese plate would take long to bring out.   Thankfully we didn't wait long for our bloody mary and mimosa, so at least there's that. The bloody mary was perfect. Spicy, made with pepper vodka. So once the cheese plate came out we dove in. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. One, because our server just dropped it off and didn't explain what cheeses were on the board. So we had no clue what we were eating. Two because the cheese selections seemed sub-par. Since I'm not sure what cheeses they were it's hard to say where they came from or what exactly they were. I will note that the biscotti on the plate was very good though!  So for the main course I ordered one of my favorite brunch items, eggs benedict. I thought they were very good. The only thing I'd change is the english muffin. It was very thin and I would have liked one that gave a better base to all the other goodness on top. But I thought the bacon, eggs and hollondaise sauce was excellent. But, again, another issue one could find is that it was a small portion. It was enough for me because I wasn't starving, and we had the cheese plate, but I did think it was small.   To sum it up, it was up and down. Our server was friendly enough, other than the misstep with the cheese plate (obviously not a huge deal). I would absolutely come back and hope they just keep trying to improve on things to make it a better place!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night. We were staying at the Westin, so it was very convenient to walk over. The look, feel, and decor of this restaurant was very nice. We had 7:30 reservations and the place was packed. Both the hostess and our waitress was very friendly. My girlfriend had the truffled mac and cheese and it was good.   Now for the bad. I had the NY strip and roasted garlic whipped potatoes, because evidently when you buy a $24 steak, it doesn't come with anything else. The only taste the steak had, was the butter on it. It was completely tasteless and chewy. It was like eating bubblegum! The whipped potatoes had way too much garlic. In my opinion, this restaurant has potential but it's trying to be something it's not, and that is an upscale dinner establishment. It is overpriced for what you get. Either they need to change the menu to burger, wings, and chicken or change chefs because it's obviously not working."}
{"text":"The food is terrible... it's tries to be authentic southern food and it's a flop- as well as being pricey for what it is. Skip it"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but not impressed with food or staff. Duck was extremely salty and rice tasted like it was out of a microwave. Not worth the money and recommend Sonoma Grill a few hundred feet away"}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food and cocktail recommendations were perfect. Started with a Margarita Flatbread, generous amounts of tomato and mozzarella. Large party so assorted brunch items and a candy bar for dessert!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"We did Valentine's Day here and it was just more expensive than what was delivered. The food was ok and our cookie for dessert was SO dry. We wanted to try it because all of the buzz around it but it was lackluster at best."}
{"text":"OVERVIEW:  The service was incredibly slow (3 hours for 3 courses) and poor, the food was overpriced for the quality and it was overly noisy.    DETAILS: Despite a reservation we were seated in the bar area which was so noisy we couldn't hear one another.  It seemed a bit quieter in the dining area.  There is a lively bar scene and the cocktails are good.  Our waiter took forever in bringing each course (an hour between appetizer and entree; 30 min to bring our drinks) and frequently forgot what we had ordered and had to come ask us again.  Our food was ok, but the flavors were generally unoriginal and somewhat bland."}
{"text":"Nice place for a business dinner. Had the chicken and waffles. Tons of flavor! Reasonably priced for a little more upscale kind of place. Drinks were good and a nice menu variety. Centrally located bar area is large, loud and a little awkward to get around, but there is decent, fun and funky seating throughout. Staff was terrific. Kitchen speed was good for conversation.   Bottom line: Not a \"must go\", but a good \"that'll do\" if you're stuck at the Westin Convention Center."}
{"text":"When you walk into this place, the atmosphere is great. I love the metal and wood and the large tables and the huge bar in the center of the restaurant. Their beer selection was pretty good with a variety of things to choose from. However, after have 2 different meals there, I'm just not that impressed with their food.   I would definitely go back to sit and have a drink or for a date night to enjoy the atmosphere but I'm not rushing back any time soon for dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"My fiance & I have dined here once for dinner.  I enjoyed their hot rocks meal. . . do NOT do the tofu as its not really good & has zero flavor but the rest was delicious. My fiance got the jambalaya seafood bowl which was good but for $30 not worth the price. We've gone for their brunch which is EXCELLENT.  Brunch here is completely worth it.  I think the biggest deal here is their drink menu & desserts. I am crazy over their s 'mores martini as they're liquid epic.... best paired with their legit s' mores dessert which is an actual fire with a Hersey bar, graham crackers,  & 3 different marshmallows.  We'll definitely give this place another go for dinner but brunch, desserts, & martinis are really worth the time to try out... you're welcome in advance. :)"}
{"text":"Well I was in town for business for 3 nights and ate here twice for dinner and once for lunch with a different group each time. Every person, and me 3 times of course, thought the food was outstanding. Ten P burger is delicious. Had the stuffed chicken for dinner. Others in my groups had the pork chop and arctic char. Great reviews all around. Good IPA on tap. Very reasonable prices and servers are attentive. Definitely a recommendation for locals and convention goers and travelers alike."}
{"text":"I got the bourbon glazed salmon, it was very sweet. My husband got the filet and it was cooked perfectly. Great atmosphere inside, definitely kept my eyes wandering."}
{"text":"Had a very good crispy chicken salad. The dijon dressing didn't pop but got some ranch and it was quite good. Fried corn bread croutons were a-mazing."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH THIS WAS GOOD. I had a no idea what to expect, but fell in love. I ordered the sage waffle with duck confit. Everything came out looking like a dream and tasted even better! My friend got the brisket sandwich, which was absolutely amazing as well. The only reason this place did not get five stars was because our server was not with it. They have wonderful indoor and outdoor seating with great lighting. I recommend this place to anyone who would love an amazing meal! Hats off, Ten Penny!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced. He came up to us maybe 3 times tops in 2 hours. We spent over 100 dollars there and we couldn't even give him more than 10%. He never spoke to us once, just waited for us to talk for him. Awful experience. Ten penny should be ashamed"}
{"text":"Heard great things, but not impressed. The waiter didn't know what beer I was asking for...and it took 10 minutes and 2 more requests for it to come. Two hearted IPA...it's on the beer list.  I ordered a Caesar salad and my entree, yet it came at the same time...I told them I didn't need it any longer. When he split the bill, instead of taking it off, he added it to my friend's bill.  This place was a disaster and it was 6pm on Easter Sunday...not exactly the busiest time. Doubt I'll come back and have no reason to recommend."}
{"text":"Went there during brunch hours on a Sunday before the Pens game.  It was quiet and pleasant.  The decor is industrial and tidy.  My husband had the special, a St. Patrick's tribute \"melt\" which was a burger with corned beef -- greasy and delicious.  I had a roast beef skillet.  It was fantastic! It was, however, not what was on the menu at all.  The menu described it as roast beef and red peppers with a horseradish cream sauce and cheddar.  There was roast beef and cheddar, and a sauce that was probably horseradish cream (not much horseradish if so), but no peppers.  There was potato instead.  It also came with a dippy egg on top and a slice of sourdough toast.  It tasted awesome, but it really wasn't what I thought I was getting.  I'd recommend you ask before ordering what you'll actually get.  We also splurged on a slice of Death by Chocolate cake that was brilliantly chocolatey.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life...and it had nothing to do with the food! Ended up going in with a party of 17. The horrible management thought it would be a good idea to put one server on this large party. First mistake. The server took our drink order. Out of 17 drinks, only 5 of them were correct. I ordered ginger ale, for I have been in recovery for over 10 years. I get my ginger ale, or what I thought, that was filled with vodka and a splash of ginger ale. Second mistake. Our food order was taken and it took over an hour to get our food. Before the food came, my father ordered a vodka tonic with extra lime. He got a vodka soda with lemon. What seasoned bartender garnishes a vodka and tonic or soda with lemon? He went up to the bar to ask for another and the bartender gave him such an attitude. She personally brought the drink to the table and slammed it on the table and walked away. Third mistake. If she worked in my restaurant, I would have fired her on the spot. When we went to the manager, the completely supported their horrible bartender. I guess customer services isn't one of the managers or staffs strong suits. The bartender who made the drinks had her long hair down and was twirling it in between drinks. Sounds like a health department call! To the bartender with the attitude - you're an amateur, if that, bartender in a hole in the wall place in pittsburgh. What a winner you are lady. To take a line from Samantha Bee - learn how to make a vodka tonic with lime, freckless ****! STAY AWAY from horrible service!"}
{"text":"I never actually leave bad reviews as I can almost always find something positive to say about a restaurant, but today was NOT good.  I've been to Ten Penny on two other occasions and very much enjoyed the food.  Today, I ordered what I always order, grilled cheese and tomato soup.  I order sweet tea to drink. It took the waitress almost 15 minutes to tell me that they were out of sweet tea (????). Then another 10 minutes to come back and say they were out of tomato soup.  25 minutes after placing my order in a very not busy restaurant seems a little long to realize that you are out of a menu item.  When my food finally came, the sandwich was dry and the cheese had started to harden.  For the price, I would expect much better food!!!  And to the previous reviewer that saw roaches; I am not surprised.  The bathroom floor was sticky and seemed to have not been cleaned in some time."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this place. I would give it zero stars if I could. I gave this place a second chance after a awful experience. It was for a bachelorette party, so it wasn't my choice. The food is awful and over priced. I am a food snob and do not hold back when I'm not happy (which is rare!!!) the chicken was dry the potato soup was as thick as cement. The last time I was here I had the chicken and waffle sandwich special. The waffle was hard and crumbly, the chicken was dry and thick. Our drinks weren't refilled and we weren't checked on. We were with a party of 20 WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A PRIORITY. I spoke directly to a manager to get our issues straightened out. He was helpful this time, but was not last time. I will never come back again. So much for a second chance."}
