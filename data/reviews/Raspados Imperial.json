{"text":"Very good fresas con crema alot of different varieties will definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Imperial Frappe!!! Blended coffee WITH a scoop of coffee ice cream... need I say more coffee lovers?  great place to relax and play some of the games they got. Try it!"}
{"text":"Usually I call in my order & the girls have my lunch ready for me by the time I get there, they always have the best customer service there too. Ceviche is usually my go-to, always fresh."}
{"text":"I've gone to a few places like this where they sell similar food but the others lack in customer service. Almost as if the employees don't want to work there. At raspados imperial not only is the food great but it's a lively place and you are always greeted with a smile. They have a little lounge and tables you can doodle on. Definitely coming here from now on."}
{"text":"I got the mazapan frappe it was good just too sweet it gave me a little headache I don't have a sweet tooth but I like the area they got Foos ball and games all that ice cream I come here with my daughter to lounge around if to get out but not be outside ...will come back to try the chamango"}
{"text":"The cleanest place by far. So delicious. Friendly. I had my favorite, the fresa con crema with EXTRA granola and it was amazing. I will definitely be back with the entire family as we have many things on our wish list of things to try. Kid friendly and clean made this place even more amazing."}
{"text":"Family friendly with great food! My boyfriend ate one of the candies from my drink so an employee so kindly gave me a few extra. I've been satisfied every time I come"}
{"text":"This place is DECE. Wife and I stopped in before a wedding to get a quick sweetened coffee. We landed on the Iced Horchata Macciato, because we are both horchata lovers!! We may be white but we get down on some Hispanic cuisine!!!!!!! 
Anyways it was super tasty! Exactly what you'd think: cinnamon rice milk, with a yummy coffee addition to it!
As we were sitting there enjoying the open, bright, cool atmosphere, the gal from the counter brought us a Green Tea Frappe on the house to try?!?! I don't know if it was an extra drink or if they made it to have us taste it but it was great!! Even better than the Macciato in my personal opinion!

Anyway, that made my day and moved me to write this review!!! Thanks Raspados Imperial!!!
(Side note: don't go in there and expect a free drink!! Just wanted to share the random act of kindness!)"}
{"text":"I saw all the yummy pics on yelp and Instagram and couldn't wait to try it! Everything I have had here was wonderful, especially the green tea frappe and the horchata frappe! My friend had a mango look and it looked awesome! Still want to try their ceviche and elote!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back my girls got a sherbert ice cream, cookies ice cream, chamoyada was good, escamocha was scrumptious and I got a Obispo shaved flavored coconut with coconut ice cream.
Staff was pleasant however we had to wait awhile longer for our order to be served.
Will return everything was good."}
{"text":"This place is my ultimate favorite place! Hands down the best one in the area. I've tried so many places but I always keep coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Quiet little shop filled with a lot of Mexican street food and the softest crepes. The environment is pretty hip, surrounded by a good mix of Spanish and English pop music. It's pretty spacious and I was so surprised that there was barely any customer because it's such a lovely shop and the food was pretty amazing!
I tried the savory chipotle crepe. It's one of the softest, most chewy crepes I've ever had. This was topped with some leafy greens, 3 slices of tomatoes, drizzled chipotle sauce, and finished with tiny pieces of cheese. Spicy green and red sauces on the side if you need the extra flavoring. Inside the crepe was embedded with slices of ham, which was nice and interesting. 
Overall good experience!! I'll gladly return to try other crepes and good looking snacks!"}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall. Very delicious desserts. I ordered the waffle with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was heaven! 
 
Update: We've been back several times and have loved it every time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fresas con crema I've had in my life !! Nice spot with good costumer service the girls are always nice"}
{"text":"I found this spot on instagram and I was immediately intrigued. The customer service at Raspados Imperial is stellar! The employees are kind and patient, especially when inquiring about their different treats. The prices are fair considering their generous servings and awesome presentation (check out their instagram). I love their elotes en vaso with chips and their iced coffee. They also have different games and markers to draw on their tables, which are great to entertain the kids. Overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"Clean store and friendly service. I tried the chamyoda (spelling) for the first time. I asked her to make it similar to the mangonada flavor since that's my favorite and she did an amazing job. I also ordered chicken panini and that was made pretty well. Just writing about it makes me want to go back to Arizona for some more chamyoda."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in the valley most definitely! The elote en vaso is so delicious with their different selections of chip garnish such as hot cheetos, ruffles, takis and Doritos!"}
{"text":"First time. I love it. Really clean place, friendly stuff and a big variety of things to eat"}
{"text":"So im not going to give you guys 5 stars bcuz ive only came here once and don't plan on coming here again. I am from the bay area and the elote en vaso is GROSS. Like do you guys really find this delicious? Ugh, sorry yall. I am not trying to be mean but NO. I also ordered a vanilla raspado, it was okay, not bad but not great. The group I came with also got chamoyadas and they were okay. I feel like if you're going to make a chamoyada or a mangoneada atleast add some MANGO SHERBERT! That will make it pop. I am going to try other places in Phoenix.


Good customer service though, waitresses came to our table and asked if everything was good and if we did not like something we can either get our money back or another item.

So 3 stars is fair."}
