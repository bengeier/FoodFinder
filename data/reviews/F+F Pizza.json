{"text":"We were SO HAPPY to see this  new and seemingly hip pizza place in our neighborhood, it looked like a great idea and the menu was appealing. 

Now before you read this, know that we are fine palates but not picky eaters by a long shot, we love our St-Henri Greasy spoons and have a sweet tooth too.

We ordered a goat cheese salad that came with a few lumps of goat-cheese like paste on some pizza dough bread, this toppered some tossed baby green with a sprinkling of walnuts and dried cranberries. The dressing tasted like commercial raspberry vinegar fare. Meh !

The pizzas we ordered were disappointing too. The spinach topping of the \"white\" pizza ran watery and flavorless, no salt or pepper could help it, bland as bland. The second, cheese and proscuito, was barely edible. The various cheeses molten into an oily crust that was heavy on the tummy and had even less taste, the proscuito did nothing to help, it was toast and dried crumbling into bits like bacon.

Our dessert hopes were also dashed by the Chocolate Fondant. How can chocolate be dissapointing ? We wondered too. But the minuscule fondant came in a cardboard boat, it was sunk deep like it had deflated and filled only half the container. despite this, the other half still ended up in the trash as the concoction is sickeningly sweet, so much so that the chocolate taste is completely overpowered. A drizzle of raspberry coulis did nothing to help, I thought I should have had the coulis with a spoon and forgone the cake !

All in all we were out $65 after tips for what is not even gourmet pizza. We should have headed to any local fast food joint and have anything our hearts desired...it would have been tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"Mmmm...what a treat! Pizza with pride! 
I LOVE pizza, but only exceptional pizza, which F+F serves. I'm very happy this place has opened up in St-Henri. It's nice to see some classy yet chill joints like this one. 
I had the warm goat cheese salad, which reminded me of my own salads (so to me, a very good thing!), I loved their homemade lemonade with Maple syrup (also something I do at home) and had the wild mushroom pizza, which was amazing but was slightly lacking in something...an olive oil drizzle of some sort? Some herbs? Also thought the crust, although clearly homemade, could have been a little more \"artisanal\" for the price. Still loved it though, and the table d'hote is a great deal (salad, 'za, beverage and desert...I had the chocolate fondant thing, SO YUM! All for $20.)

Special bonus: An enormous collection of hot sauces! Now, if only they had some home-made herb-infused olive oil drizzles.... what can I say? I love me some olive oil."}
{"text":"Service courtois, ambiance relax, pizz délicieuse. J'ai essayé la Smoked Meat, et je la re-prendrai certainement!"}
{"text":"Warning!! never go there. I went last Friday night and we have been all incredibly sick!!! In all sorts of way and for a whole 48h! Felt like dying. Never been sick after a restaurant ever. Please avoid, for your own sake"}
{"text":"Pizza deserves 4 stars but they only offer one size and it didn't satisfy my hunger which led me to order a 2nd one...2 \"Habs\" pizza totalled 32$... Don't feel I got my money's worth. They do however offer over 10 varieties of hot sauces!!! This was an amazing plus to add some kick to the pizza!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY disappointed with the service.
Placed my order, waited an hour then called for an update:
- Deliverer *supposedly* came and waited at door (impossible since there is a doorman who would have called)
- Deliverer *may* have called but unclear since there was a call from some free service (Viber?) that rang once and hung up immediately at some point within the hour. Could not redial because it was not a real number.

Instead of offering to make things right, F+F was willing to redo our order and make us wait another hour -- thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, because I went to their location on Mont-Royal right when it opened and the experience was great. This location is a different story. I went with three friends a few nights ago and sat on the terrace. Because St Catherine is closed to vehicles at this time of year down there, it was a really great experience to sit out there. The food was ok -- but the service was dreadful. We all got the table d'hôte which is $24 for salad, pizza, non-alcoholic drink, and dessert. A good deal! Long story short, the salads never came and ended up being served with the pizza (not a huge deal), then we never saw the server again. Half our table was cleared at a certain point, but about 30 minutes after that we decided just to go inside to pay. At the register, we reminded her that we had dessert with our meals and she laughed, saying she had totally forgotten. As we paid, she piped chocolate icing into to-go plastic cups and handed them to us. Strange! I actually think their pizza is pretty good -- so I recommend it -- but strongly suggest going to a different location."}
{"text":"This place is a COMPLETE ripoff. I've never seen a smaller pizza. Go anywhere else and you will get a pizza twice the size for the same price. And the pizza is absolutely mediocre. I've never written a restaurant review before but I felt compelled to warn people to NOT ORDER FROM HERE."}
{"text":"Great pizzas and ambiance, definitely worth a visit!

The service is much better than you' d expect in a pizza place and there is draft beer and wine available."}
{"text":"La pizza n'est pas mauvaise, mais pour le prix elle, est incroyablement petite. Elle me fait penser aux anciennes pizza du McDo de mon enfance... Oui mcdo ont déjà fait de la pizza)
C'est la première et la dernière fois que j'y prend une pizza.
Le magpie vaut drôlement le détour pour le même prix."}
{"text":"Nouvelle pizzeria franchement géniale. En plus de plusieurs combinaisons intéressantes la carte nous propose plusieurs formules rabais pour combler autant notre soif que notre appétit. Du dimanche au mardi ils ont la seconde pizza à moitié prix. L'ambiance est très moderne et la qualité du service impeccable. Un must dans le quartier Rosemont."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.

The pizzas aren't amazing but they are 2 levels above a Pizza Hut or a Domino's BY FAR.

I took the La Pancetta and while I hated the black olives which totally overwhelmed the entire pizza (I picked them out), the coriander added something unexpected.

Highly recommended to try as your first pizza.

My friend took the Wild Mushroom pizza and he liked it, but I took a bite and found it flavourless compared to La Pancetta (read: not as salty). I think if I was on a low sodium diet or was not used to a lot of salt, the Wild Mushroom pizza would be perfect with all of the different flavours of mushrooms in there.

One star comes off for the tomato sauce which I can taste came out of a jar and was not homemade from fresh tomatoes (sorry I'm a snob.. what can I say).

Other than that, great, decent, \"fast food\" that is delicious and fast... and somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was really good. I work close by so I order from there sometimes. Delivery is pretty fast however pizza arrives lukewarm with cheese barely melted. I order a dulce de leche pot mason which is 6$ and instead I got a small plastic cup filled with some sort of crumbly mousse. It tasted fine but wasn't worth it. Pretty disappointed. They have good customer service but the quality of the food went down. Hope it doesn't go downhill from here."}

4400 Rue Notre-Dame O, Montréal, QC

NEVER GO THERE  

Today I went with my friend to eat there for lunch. 
Outside they had a sign that for launch special Pizza together with a drink was  $ 11. 
We went inside and a middle-aged waiter gave us the menus. 
I did not look the menu -  my friend did. 
I asked directly the waiter to recommend me one of the lunch specials. 
He suggested a Pizza and he said that is coming with a soft drink. 
I told him that I usually do not have soft drinks. 
\"But\" I said \"if is included then bring me also the soft drink but bring me also cold regular water\". 
My friend ordered by the menu. 
After a while they brought us 2 Pizzas.
Both Pizzas were very small and they were no tasty at all. 
After he brought us the bill. 
And I see that in the bill he charged me $ 12 for this disgusting Pizza and $ 3 extra for a small cane soft drink. 
I said to him kindly that he did a mistake. 
I ordered the special and I even ask him to recommend me a Pizza from the special. 
He came to our table and he start screaming and insulting my friend and me. He was telling us that all was our fault and we were responsible for not understanding what he said. 
We were 2 people. 
Both we understood that we asked for the special and we both understood that the soft drink was included. 
Not only he did not accept anything but he was insulting us big time - we are stupid not to understand what special is. 
I HONESTLY WANTED TO CALL THE POLICE. 
Not only he stolen from us  a few dollars but he wanted on top of that to accept that we are stupid. 
My friend pulled me by my sleeve.
Does not worth to create a big case - we just both lost a few dollars. 
I am writing this immediately after the event. 
The experience was terrible. 
The portions were very small and not tasty. 
They steal you and they insult you on top of that. 
I will never go there and I advice everybody: 
NEVER GO THERE."}
{"text":"There is a lot of competition for pizza, but F+F has become a favourite because of their fresh ingredients and great salads.

Pizzas have a fairly thin but  crispy crust, lots of fresh ingredients and tasty sauce. Salads (meal size) are equally tasty and very good portions.

I highly recommend this one for the Sud-Ouest neighbourhood. Not sure why other reviews tend to be so low."}
{"text":"Pizza was expensive. $16.10 after tax for a personal size 10\" thin crust pizza. It was pretty sloppy too. Pick up a piece and it wilts like a wet pancake. Bacon was undercooked. I don't see this place lasting another six months. For that kind of money there really should be some sort of value adder. Ie: organic, imported ingredients of some extravagance."}
{"text":"I'm very happy that this place opened up in the neighborhood because it fills the niche of tasty AND affordable pizza on the Plateau. The menu is similar to that of Romeo (just a few steps away, on Mont-Royal). We had a pizza (the \"weed eater\": pancetta, cheeses, tomato sauce, arugula) and a Caesar salad;  the food was at least as good as at their above-mentioned competitor's, but for cheaper. The overall look and ambiance of the place is less fancy, though. We had drinks (several cocktails were on special for $5). Tasted good but not much alcohol in there... Friendly and timely service, relaxed atmosphere, clean place. I will go back."}
{"text":"Petite mise à jour : Il y a maintenant plusieurs succursales à Montréal et dans ses environs!

P.-s. Ils ont de la pâte à pizza sans gluten!"}
{"text":"Well, you might be little too surprised by my 4 stars for this place but it was - surprisingly :P 

First star for the service - the guy at the counter was super friendly but not overly and helpful.  He even said bye when his shift was ended.  

The second star for the price and special offer on monday to wednesday; second pizza 50% off, we didn't know that but the server told us, how nice of him :).  

The thrid star for the music.  The interior (as you can guess?) is like nice green painted wall with nothing on it so it's kinda place that if the door is closed, all the music could bounce back to your ears but fortunately all the door was open, additionaly to that the music was nice.  I thought I'd hear obnoxious pop or rap( it looked like that kind of place you'd hear those music) but I heard soft jazz like Diane Kroll and etc.  We, my husband and i, could have nice conversation and read books and magazine while we were waiting for the pizza.

The fourth star for the pizza.  Nothing to complain about.  We ordered Habs and Carbonara, all were good.  The dough was exceptionally good- when you pick up the pizza it stayed almost straight, isn't it how you see if it's good dough?  The topping was generous but not overly too much - I really appriciate it when the pizza has all the toppings evenly spread on the pizza dough.  They were all delicious.  How do I know?  Before we had long walk- about one hour? :P or little more, we had huge falafel wrap at home for dinner and had the pizza after one pint of beer at the Terrasse St. Amboise~!!

I could give 5 stars I suppose but after paris trip and gave 5 stars for L'arpege, I couldn't let myself to give 5 stars to this place..... now I have even more high standard!

Oh!  and just you know, we decided to give a try because of the huge selection of hot sauces on the counter.  I am a hot sauce person so it was extremly intriguing- I wanted to taste the pizza just itself so I didn't pour all the hot sauces over but next time I will



They use a cute green electric scooter for the delivery.  Very quiet and nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic thin crust gourmet pizza. Try a Margerita with Parmigiano Reggiano, marinara and basil."}
{"text":"The pizza here offered a few new topping options that I normally wouldn't find in my local pizza haunts,  so that was nice. Little baby pickles on the table are nice to snack on while you're waiting for your food and to add on top also. The pizza size is slightly on the smaller side of medium. A good portions for a  \"personal size\". Nice for sharing. There are nice pizza and drink deals also. I split a pizza and 2 beers with a friend for about 22 bucks, I'd consider that a decent deal anytime."}
{"text":"Souper à deux .  Nous avons pris deux pizzas, une garnie et l'autre sans gluten et sans fromage.  Croûte très mince au sarrasin, mais qui n'était pas brûlée comme dans d'autres pizzerias.  Comme les plats sans gluten sont très rares dans les restos, j'ai très apprécié celui-là.  Il y a même du vin et de la bière sans gluten.

À recommander pour les personnes hypersensibles au gluten qui veulent manger au Resto vite fait."}
{"text":"Warning, food is quite heavy...actually it's probably because I had a whole 9 \" pizza for myself plus couple more slices from another pizza. Anyways! Service is very professional, for sure. I ordered a Mexican pizza, but instead got a different styled one. The waitress insisted she give it to me on the house even after I refused out of not caring so much. I took up on her offer and she told the kitchen to make me my initial order, the Mexican.

My pizza, the wrong order and the good one were both good. I liked the Mexican more and the waitress helped me pick a hot sauce too to go with it! (They had SO many different hot sauces to choose from because her boss travels a lot, so he brings back different sauces)

If you're looking for decent cheap pizzas (around $12-14 for 9\") check this place out. They also have a 5 a 7  which is 2 beers for the price of one!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, but for a delivery it's really not my preferred place. Very disappointed, got 3 pizzas that was very expensive for what I got, missing toppings and dough of one of them wasn't even properly cooked"}
{"text":"Had an all-dressed pizza and liked it a lot.  
My daughter enjoyed her marguerita pizza. 
The service was attentive and friendly. Decor is urban chic - very clean  
They serve on site and have take out. 
It's in a small mall so parking is not a problem."}
{"text":"The BPM pizza substituted with garlic instead of onions was very good. My husband liked La Gourmande. It was very good but small pizza for the price. Otherwise would have given 5 stars"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, fair prices and service was excellent. I wish they had more than just pizza and salad. All four of us were not disappointed by our choice."}
{"text":"Good quality pizzas with great flavours! This small restaurant has great charm and the service is outstanding. Out of the 5 pizzas I've tried at this place, my favourites are the bavette pizza & the margherita, surprisingly. One comment: the homemade lemonade is a bit bland. The prices are not cheap but you're paying for flavour and quality. Great job!"}
{"text":"The pizza served here is OK. 

The menu is very impressive and gives you the confidence that you'll receive incredibly delicious pizza. 

The reality is that you'll be underwhelmed. For the price, you don't really receive much pizza and the taste is unremarkable. 

If they worked harder on higher quality ingredients and deeper flavours, this place would be a winner.

On a positive note, the restaurant decor is nice."}
{"text":"I went here the other day after Beast of the East. I was tired and hungry to say the least. I was a little worried that they would not be able to handle a group of 25 plus; neverthless, the service was still fast. Most importantly, they brought us our drinks asap. I ate the white pizza, wich tasted nice and creamy with herbs. Next time I'm going for the smoked duck."}
{"text":"Gluten-free pizza, boys and girls! And you'd never know the difference, other than the fact that it's more delicious than regular pizza. I'd categorize these pizzas as definitely gourmet, due to the high end ingredients and unique combinations. It's a small franchise and I hope it keeps growing, because it's the best pizza I've had in the city. 
This is a jewel in the heart of the grittiest part of Saint-Henri, not far from other unassuming hotspots like Grumman 78. I say it's unassuming because many a night, you can go in (say, on a Sunday night) and have the place completely to yourself. It's airy, cozy and clean, lots of candles and a big, beautiful painting on the back wall that I'd love to own. 
We have always been treated very well by the staff here, always felt comfortable and like we belonged."}
{"text":"Very good wholesome pizzas! So far the best pizza in town, just make sure to ask them to make it well done. We had the La Mexicaina and it was very fresh."}
{"text":"Walked in on a rainy Sunday evening and there wasn't a fly in the house. The place is nice, with its green walls, banquet seating and wooden tables; very casual with a jar of cutlery and napkins, as well as pickles set on your table. 

We ordered a plain margherita pizza and a gravlax salad to share. The pizza was okay, the dough was a little too over cooked and could be chewier, but it wasn't the best I've had. What I liked most was the salad; served in a bread bowl, the ingredients were fresh, abundant and the vinaigrette was delicious! We cracked the bowl and added it to the salad for some crunch and thoroughly enjoyed that part of our meal. 

The service was good; then again, we were their only customers, although the waiter had trouble understanding our drink order: Stella in a glass?! ?

Overall, great spot for a hearty salad and casual meal but I'd go down the street for the pizza"}
{"text":"J'ai fais livrer le spécial 4 pizzas pour 44$, la livraison à pris 1h15 (le gars au téléphone disait entre 30 et 45 minutes) et ce même si le resto était situé à 4 coins de rue de chez moi. La pizza est donc arrivée froide. 

Pour ce qui est du goût, c'est vraiment pas fameux, beaucoup trop salé, et les garnitures ne sont vraiment pas de bonne qualité. Pour 13$ de moins tu peux avoir 4 pizzas 9\" au Pizza Saint-Viateur et c'est 100 fois meilleur."}
{"text":"C'est à Montréal que j'ai pu tester cette chaîne de pizzeria. De premier abord, ça semble peu attirant. On est arrivé là un peu par dépit, les autres établissements aux alentours étant tous fermés ou presque. 
Le service a été long, très long ... Et on était seulement 6 heureusement ... De plus sur la commande passée, la serveuse est revenue 3 fois nous voir : une fois pour dire que deux des pizze n'étaient plus disponibles ce soir là et une troisième fois pour dire qu'il manquait un ingrédient et que donc il serait remplacé par autre chose ... De plus, pour le prix j'ai trouvé que nos pizze étaient un peu petites. Mais heureusement, elles étaient bonnes (ce qui a permis de remonter la note à 3 étoiles). Bref, je n'y retournerais vraiment que si je n'ai pas le choix ! Je ne m'y déplacerais pas exprès."}
{"text":"Quelle chance, un nouveau restaurant pour ma première évaluation. F+F Pizza pour frais et fantastique, qualifie bien les plats servis. J'ai pris une salade au chèvre chaud en entrée et je dois dire qu'il n'y a définitivement aucun doute sur la fraîcheur (probablement la meilleure salade au chèvre chaud). Les ingrédients de la pizza étaient tout aussi frais.  Rehaussé votre pizza avec une de la dizaine de sauces piquantes qui vous sont offertes. Expérimentez avec ces différentes sauces pour faire ressortir des saveurs surprenantes. Lors de ma visite, le restaurant n'avait pas encore reçu son permis pour l'alcool (ce qui devrait être réglé momentanément), j'ai donc pris un Coca-Cola en bouteille. Je dois dire que ça fait une grande différence. 

Look bistro un peu éclectique avec bancs d'églises, tables en bois de planche à couper, chandelles, cornichons, toiles, musique électrojazz. Lui confère un cachet en parfaite harmonie avec cet ancien quartier ouvrier en pleine revitalisation grâce, entre autres, au nouveau Centre universitaire de santé McGill. Situé à moins de deux kilomètres."}
{"text":"J'adore cette pizzeria qui offre un menu rapide et léger tout en étant de qualité, ce qui manque trop souvent dans ce secteur. L'ambiance est décontractée, la décoration urbaine et minimale (tables de bois pâle, ardoise avec des dessins au mur), mais la cuisine ouverte fait en sorte que la salle est parfois enfumée.

La nourriture est simple et recherchée à la fois, une grande variété de pizzas qui vont et viennent avec les saisons, quelques salades pour l'entrée. Un vaste choix de sauces piquantes est proposé, pour les amateurs. Les assiettes sont très généreuses pour le prix!

La sélection de vin est courte, une dizaine de bouteilles, toutes à 38$, et tous les vins sont servis au verre également. Il y a parfois des cocktails (une fois on offrait un gin tonic à l'érable) mais c'est rare. Quatre bières viennent compléter l'offre.

En résumé, pour un souper ou un dîner relax sans être crade, avec un service efficace et courtois, quoique parfois familier, c'est une excellente adresse!"}
{"text":"The F+F pizza chain offers decent pizza and impressive salads, but their new joint at IDS was a pleasant surprise. Hurrah for more local competition and more hurrah for the good quality of the food. F+F are known for their fresh salads served in a bowl of baked pizza dough. The salad has been always top quality, but the bowl today surpassed my expectations, just taken out of the oven, crispy at the bottom, fluffy at the top, yum. I would strongly recommend their signature salad F+F. The pizza was also nice surprise, thinner and crispier  as what I have tried in other locations. The goat cheese and spinach as well as wild mushroom pizzas were delicious. The restaurant is small and industrial cosy. There is a TV on top of the bar, where hockey was shown in silent mode even during the day. The service was five stars during lunch time and prices of the lunch menu options are really attractive. I guess I'm coming back to try this place for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit au coeur de St-Henri. Excellente salade César. Excellente pizza. Prix plus que raisonnable. J'adore."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the Gluten Free pizza here. I've actually been having a hard time finding GF options in Montreal and frankly, Domino's has a better gf crust than these guys.

Service wasn't bad. The messed up my order, but after I called them they fixed it."}
{"text":"Everyone there is very attentive to customer satisfaction. Food tastes great and choices on the menu are varied.

Whether it be for takeout or to dine in store, the experience is well worth it. And the menu is not expensive !"}
{"text":"I discovered F+F Pizza while taking a stroll one evening on Notre-Dame with my husband. Hungry and somewhat far away from home, we decided to give it a try. I had \"la white\" and he had \"la chèvre\"; we thought they both were pretty good. We enjoyed the thick fresh cheese and thought it was nice to have a freshly made pizza that did not taste like pure grease for a change. The only thing both pizzas lacked was spices and salt. F+F Pizza has the potential to be more than just good if only they were a bit bolder with their recipes. I feel they've got all the basics covered and already have all the fresh ingredients they require; they only need to add a small touch of magic to transform their good pizzas into excellent pizzas.

All in all we liked it and we probably will visit again in the future."}

{"text":"Wow!  Nous avons été très impressionné par l'accueil flegmatique de l'hôte un samedi soir à 21:25 nous disant impatient et effrayé devant une groupe de 8 dont 3 touristes Européens : \"Nous n'avons que take out!\"    Quoi?  Un samedi soir à St-Henri quand c'est écrit que tu fermes à 23h???  Tu oublis de répondre bonsoir et de suite tu indiques que tu nous servira que si on le prend pour emporter?  Vraiment?  Tout le groupe on sait regarder et en riant on a tourné les talons...  Y a tellement d'autres endroits au alentours prêt à servire 8 affamés qui veulent dépenser en moyenne 30$/ personne...

Tu parles au yiable...  Un samedi, 9:30... Te faire dire froidement:  \"je te sers de la pizza de luxe si tu me fiche le camp d'aller la manger dehors, même si on ferme dans 1:30...\"   Too bad guys...  Tu viens de faire perdre 5 clients du Sud-ouest qui vont en parler à une centaine d'autres personnes du coins et au-delà, de cette épisode et tu nous as aussi faire honte devant nos amis d'outre atlantique qui se demandaient si nous étions dans une banlieu dortoir...?

En terminant:  nous étions tous des premiers goûteurs épicurien prêt à faire l'expérience F+F...  Semblerait que ce fut une dégustation intérompu, même avortée...   La pâte n'a pas du tout levé...  Et le professeur de notre groupe leur à donné F+  ;)

Bonne chance avec votre relation à la clientèle et respect!"}
{"text":"I don't get why the reviews on here are not better! I had two pizzas delivered using foodora. 

One pizza was La chèvre which consisted of goat cheese, mozzarella, tomatoes, white onion and tomato sauce. The other was La bavette which had steak, mushrooms, red onions, mozzarella and tomato sauce. This pizza came with a side of sour crème and fines herbs. Both pizzas were freaking delicious but if I had to pick a favourite it would have to be the bavette.

The crusts were really good too... greasy and doughy. Mmmm. I will definitely reorder from this pizza place !!"}

Énorme collection de sauces piquantes pour ceux qui aiment ça spicy!!"}
{"text":"Went there couple of times. If you are on Iles des Soeurs and craving for a pizza, you have 2 options. F+F Pizza and Chez Carl. 
Some might suggest a pizza at Restaurant Parthenon. My answer is No with a capital N. Parthenon has plenty of other choices than pizza (you can check my review for suggestions). 

Before we jump into the food, i would like to take a moment and provide a feedback on the decor. No big effort was invested in that place. Besides the picture on the wall, there is nothing much to talk about.

What I enjoy the most there is the pickles. Each table has a small jar of pickles. You can enjoy eating  them (if u like pickles) while waiting for the pizza.
Based on my experience, the waiting time isn't long during lunch time.

The pizza over there is fine. It is baked in an oven (not firewood).
The dough is a bit thick. But, taking into account the small size of the pizza, I think that the thickness compensates the size. I prefer the Italian style with a thin dough.
I tried the Pig Mac pizza. It comes with beaf. I also tried the Gourmande and the Buffalo. These are heavy pizza but a good ones. 
Yes, I can hear your thought \"who orders such pizzas\". Well, I can blame it on my curiosity and hunger. In that type of restaurants I like to try pizzas that I wouldn't try in a traditional Italian restaurant.
What I also like during lunch time is the option to choose a soft drink that is included in the lunch menu.
The service in general is good."}
