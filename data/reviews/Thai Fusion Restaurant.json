{"text":"been goin to Thai Fusion at Coxwell and O'Connor for several years - great Thai food (actually run by Thai's, not Chinese) at a good price - Combo specials are the best deal - entree with either mango salad or soup - only about $9 !  sometimes they even throw in some ice cream for dessert ! Only potential negative is the spotty service - they get overwhelmed when busy,  which slows service to a crawl.  Washrooms could use a renovation, too.  Parking is relatively easy - pay attention to the parking times as the Green Hornets patrol regularly."}
{"text":"I think this place was my 2nd ever experience with Thai food.  After having just moved to Toronto, and trying Spring Rolls, I figured this place may be worth a shot since it was in my neighborhood at the time.  Glad I went.  I immediately loved the chicken pad thai.  Although very different from Spring Rolls' version, I liked it just as much.  Spicier.  Darker sauce.  But YUM!!!   Haven't tried much else on the menu other than the regular spring rolls which are good too.  Liquor licensed.  Have eaten in a few times.  It's a small family-run operation in a small strip on Coxwell that has an LCBO, convenience stores, tanning salon, etc.  There's a high school by it as well, and some of the kids there seem to go to this place at lunch.  Maybe 10 tables?  Small, clean, simple yet not \"too simple\" casual atmosphere.  Generally very friendly service.  When I was a regular, they knew my order before I said it.  Now I live so far away, I think they don't know my face anymore, but I wouldn't expect them to.  Next time I am in that neighborhood, I must remember to pick up some veg pad thai to go, to test that."}
{"text":"Meh is precisely how I felt about this place.  I came here by accident recently.  After ordering my food, I stepped outside and noticed that there alot of people in what looked like a traditional old diner across the street.  On closer inpsection, I realized that that place was really where I had been intending to go.  Oh well, next time.  The food here was precisely \"Meh\".  As in, \"Hey this is the only restaurant for miles and we're starving.  Okay, it'll do.\""}
{"text":"I can only comment on the quality of the food since I got takeout.  The portions were really small and the flavours bland.  The pieces of chicken were tiny.  Probably the worst Thai takeout I've ever had.  Well, I'll strike Thai Fusion off my list."}
