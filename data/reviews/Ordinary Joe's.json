{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere, along with very good food and drinks. The owner, Joe (\"The Big Kahuna\"), has been in the business for quite some time and has mastered all the bar/restaurant nuances and tricks. My family and I go very often and we are hardly ever left disappointed."}
{"text":"Wife said \"We're goin out for dinner tonight, so where we goin'?\" Despite the initial Yelps I saw,  it was off to Ordinary Joe's we go.   Walking in we were greeted with a pleasant upscale decor for a \"Sports Bar\".   Patrons were a mix of business types and a couple of blue collar guys having a drink at the bar. Bartender was attentive and genuine. Short but nice selection of craft drafts.  I had a mushroom Swiss burger, she had a steak salad,  and we shared the onion rings to start.  Prices were appropriate for what you get, portions good, and we both really enjoyed the grub! When I think of \"Sports bar\",  I think of of overpriced Coors Light in plastic cups and too much  noise.  That's not this place at all.  If your looking for a Sports Bar a notch above, try Joe's!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Very cool metal designs and perfect for watching sport games. The bar has a great set up and I love the menu. The portions are great for what you pay and management genuinely cares that you're satisfied! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little sports bar!  The staff is very friendly, the food was very good.  Something to note, the chicken wings are not \"double grease dipped\" but fresh out of the fryer and very juicy and tasty.  We were there for dinner on a Saturday night at 6:00 and had no issue getting a table."}
{"text":"TV's are great. Beer selection is not good. On a slow night our food took FOREVER! Our fries were cold, burger burnt, and bacon on the burger not cooked. This was our 3rd time here and the experience has been the same every time. Very sad because we were so hopeful."}
{"text":"Was nervous to try this place based on the reviews not giving them much credit for what they're doing.  I found this to be a really neat, well-set up bar that offered excellent service and really good food! It's nothing super fancy, bar food options, but different than Tavern down the street's menu.  It wasn't busy when we went on Friday at 9pm, just a few people scattered throughout and sitting at the bars.  I LOVE the fact that they have two rows of just \"bar style\" seating behind the actual bar.  I think that's a really great idea for those that are going to watch a game on one of their many massive televisions.  I forget our server's name, but he took really great care of us and had a lot of recommendations.  We started with the buffalo chicken dip on fresh chips and I requested extra celery.  It was a very generous portion with SO many chips (which is good because normally you run out of chips with your dip!!)  I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad and Bobby ordered one of the burgers with fries.  Both meals were excellent and large for the price.  We both had left over when we were full from eating.  Food and drink prices aren't anything super cheap, but comparable to what you will find at other bars in Awall.  As I expected, it was the typical Fox Chapel crowd.  It's a nice place to go and catch a game and eat dinner or just stop in for a few drinks with friends.  I really like the atmosphere and that it is close to home.  Aspinwall needed something like this."}
{"text":"The food was great , prices fair and the best mixed drinks I've had . My first time here and will definitely return"}
{"text":"Ordinary Joe's is a great place to go! Great spot to watch the sport teams, I'm from out of town and the atmosphere there made me feel very welcomed!! Their food was great, but their pizza was to die for, they also had FULL sized wings! I never ate at a place with FULL sized wings, they were excellent. The service was great and fast the decor was spot on with making a sports bar modernized.!"}
{"text":"Ordinary Joe's is the newest bar/restaurant option in Aspinwall. They claim to be the only sports bar in the area, and while I'm not sure if that's technically true, they do have a ton of TVs, so it would be a great place to catch a game (if you can afford to stay here for 2-3 hours and drink...more on that in a sec).   The restaurant itself is open, clean and bright (but not too bright), and the decor is modern and sleek (love the metal Pittsburgh sports logo art adorning the walls). They did a really nice job updating the dark and noir feeling of the space's previous tenant (Marisqueira).   The menu is pretty standard bar fare (burgers, wings, sandwiches), with some more substantial dinner options thrown in (pastas, fish entrees). They did a good job not overlapping their menu options too much with the bar a few doors down (Sam's Tavern). The beer selection is not particularly impressive or expansive for a bar, but it'll probably suit most people just fine. On our recent visit here, I opted for some good ol' chicken fingers and fries, while my husband got the Italian Stallion burger. The food was good, but nothing noteworthy. The chicken tenders were the exact same generic frozen-from-a-bag variety that I've gotten other places a million times before. I did really enjoy the fries...they seemed to be fresh cut and were very well seasoned. My husband liked his burger, but again, thought it was \"just a burger.\" Good, but not great. And that's exactly what I would expect at a sports bar, so I really can't complain about the food. Service was fast and friendly, so I also can't complain about the service.  The problem is the prices. I have no idea why a lot of places in Aspinwall seem to be overpriced. I don't know if it is its proximity to Fox Chapel, which makes business owners think patrons will be willing to pay more. I don't know if it's the fact that Aspinwall is not a huge neighborhood, and thus lower volume necessitates higher pricing. But at Ordinary Joe's, I felt like everything was priced about 20% too high for what you got. I mean, my chicken tenders and fries were $10. I don't even know if they even charge that much for chicken tenders at PNC Park, haha. My husband's burger was $11 (and he can get a better burger at Burgatory for that same price). And $4 for a bottle of Labatt's? During a Pens game, no less? I mean, if you call yourself a sports bar, I think you should probably have drink specials during the games....that's a pretty standard move for most sports bars. Because otherwise, at $4 a bottle for a fairly crappy beer, there is no way I'm hanging around for 2-3 hours and drinking there while I watch a game.  I may give Ordinary Joe's another try sometime, particularly if they decide to start offering drink specials during games, but I'm not going to be rushing back there. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The bartenders are nice BUT the alcohol is watered down. Don't recommend unless you only drink beer"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here around 9-10:30 on a Friday night and there were plenty of tables open. The service was incredible. Our waitress was very nice and they had a good draft beer selection. Prices were average. We both had amazing burgers. I would definitely recommend. There wasn't anything interesting on tv, but we will definitely be back during a game because of their nice displays! Overall a cool spot!"}
{"text":"Pros: Dark, cozy, attentive bartenders, lots of TVs  Cons:  Newer place with an unreliable menu, often with waaaaay too much hot sauce on everything! I mean everything.  It wants to be sports bar, but still has that restaurant feel. Or an off track betting place feel."}
{"text":"We've been there twice before and the food was very good.  Last time there the fried fish was fresh with a tempura type beer batter not a frozen cod like most places.  It was thick and flakey white cod.  Well that has changed, visited last night and the fish is nothing special.  It's like every other bar now, a frozen log of cod.  We were excited to invite friends so they could try the fish.  I had to apologize."}
{"text":"Contrary to some reviews we found the prices for drinks and especially food to be more than reasonable. Great burger done exactly right. Tons of food for 11 bucks. Not a beer drinker so can't address that but good glass of wine for $7. Will revisit soon.  Good service and speedy. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Just browsing through restaurants nearby... and wanted to add my take on Ordinary Joe's.  I live in Aspinwall (for a little over a year now).  The prices are high at Ordinary Joe's because it's close to Fox Chapel and lots of residents in and around Aspinwall/Fox Chapel think they are high class folk with extra change to spare.  That said, if you order the wings... you will not be sad with the price or the taste.  Whole wings, fried to order, come piping hot with a few different flavors to pick from.  I've ordered at least 2-3 varieties and have been happy with each.  The blue cheese dressing though... I literally crave it.  I have no idea if it's homemade but it sure does taste like it.  It's devine.  Ordinary Joe's is a nice, not overly decorated, bar with lots of TVs, that is willing to put a non-Pittsburgh sports game on (even when the Penguins are playing!).  Delicious whole wings, fantastic blue cheese dressing, and out of state courtesy.  Much more than I can say about the other bar down the street.  I will return to Ordinary Joe's again and again :)"}
{"text":"Nice little sports bar in Aspinwall. Easy parking right along the street. Very clean, very modern, and great service from the bartender. They have plenty of BIG TV's and 8 beers on tap. Exactly what you want from a sports bar. I was in search of a place to have a few drinks and eat a late lunch all by myself. Ordinary Joe's fit the bill. It was about 3:30pm on a Friday and there were only 4 people seated at the bar. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and a few glasses of Summer Shandy.  The B.C. wrap was $11 and came with a side of onion rings. Huge portion of onion rings, but just your typical bar food. They do have a really great selection of food from burgers, salads, sandwiches and wings, to hoagies, soup and appetizers.   I'd stop in again for a drink!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last week, at first glance I walked in and it was a very clean and nice sports bar. In fact, if I was going to just have a beer or two, I would go back. Unfortunately for me, I went here to eat and was severely disappointed. I had the Five Alarm burger with fries. The burger itself seems like it was cooked in advance and reheated, as it was completely dry, sporting a gray color, the fries were of the undercooked frozen crinkle cut variety. When you are paying $11 for a burger, you'd expect something fresh. To top that off, the server couldn't care less about our table, not even asking why I'm leaving half a burger on my plate (I couldn't finish it) or if I'd like to take it with me."}
{"text":"We have visited here twice now. One time to eat and one time for drinks. I must say we do prefer the drinking here more than eating. Aspinwall was in dyer need of a bar like this! It's a laid back sports bar that's a notch higher than a dive. It's clear they are still working out some kinks, but that's to be expected to a brand new place. The service has always been very welcoming and the drinks are a fair price. The food is pretty standard bar food nothing out of the ordinary, but it's perfect for when you're drinking a beer and watching the game on one of their 12 tvs! The four stars is for the residents of Aspinwall, not to make the trip in to town for. I hope they develop drink specials and some entertainment in the future."}
{"text":"Ordinary Joe's is a wonderful sports bar. The food is deliciously prepared and bountiful. I especially enjoyed the meatball sandwich. The wait staff is extremely friendly and engaging and the restaurant is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Went to Ordinary Joe's last night for some wings and to watch the Pens game. This was probably my 3rd time there. Sat at the bar, which has a nice set up and very clean. There is also a hightop table behind the bar if there isn't a bar stool available.   The bartender last night was extremely attentive and worked hard to serve the bar patrons and the other bar areas. I would suggest they have more than one bartender for busy nights. The wings were very good even though they only offer full wings. The prices were to be expected for the area and the restaurant.   Pros: Service, set up, good wings, nice place to watch a game.  CONS: No Miller Lite or domestic on draft. Serve only full wings."}
{"text":"We've gone there a few times because it's casual and an in between meeting place. Salads are good. Prices seem to be reasonable. Last time we were there my son ordered a rare burger. It came out well done. He sent it back and the next one came out cooked even more. It wasn't busy there and the waitress said they had a new cook. At least they didn't charge us. My wife enjoyed her grilled chicken salad and friends said their sandwiches were good. I would go back there again. Service was good. We didn't sit in the bar area but the restaurant part."}
