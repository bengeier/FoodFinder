{"text":"We've stayed at the hotel twice and breakfast is included in our stay. Last year, breakfast was perfect, but this year...not so much! The food was great, but the service was awful. Our waiter literally dumped the coffee into our cups. He didn't smile at all and was very rude in the way he acted. It pretty much ruined the whole experience. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"the cheese platter and champagne is good, I went for dinner on a Saturday night, not much people at 7pm. I should visit on a weekday and try their sushi menu. Overall not a lot of choices for dinner"}
{"text":"Very nice place and super friendly staff. Went with my husband for a late lunch and split a few things. They actually split everything into two plates so both of us didn't have to eat from just one plate. Their bread dip was delicious. It was fava beans mashed and mixed with herbs.  The turkey club was perfectly cooked with super crispy bacon.   Afterwards the waitress told us about the neighborhood and suggested some cool places to visit near the hotel."}
{"text":"Hi! My friend and I went to the Citrus restaurant today to taste their Winterlicious  menue and I must say we were very pleasantly surprised! Appetizers were large size and very tasty! Main entre was huge and the meat was falling of of the bone ..great we had lam shanks. No room  for desert  had to take it home. It was yummy!  I looked at their regular menu and I must say it looks good and the prices are very reasonable they have a nice patio for the summer season.  Service was goo, We will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars*  I'm not sure about the Grand Hotel and Suites - it seems like one of those hotels that hasn't really kept up with the times. I never even knew they had a decent restaurant/lounge until my dad brought it up!  Citrus has a lovely (and fairly large) side patio that is divided into smoking and non-smoking. The smoking area is uncovered which means you will get plenty of sunshine, while the non-smoking area is covered and there are even these doors that slide up and down to block the wind. It's all very chique - white chairs, white table cloths...almost a South Beach cool vibe.  I was early and asked if I could sit down at the table to have a drink - not a problem at all. They have decent wine selections by the glass and I started off with a glass of Pinot and because I was hungry, ordered a California hand Roll. I was soooo happy to see that they had a Japanese menu (rolls), but the actual thing was such a let down. Basically, you get a roll, like the shape, like literally. I'm used to a Cornucopia shaped hand roll, but Citrus does things differently. Filling and thick, but that's about it.  For appetizer, I had a lovely refreshing salad and I absolutely loved my main which was a tomato risotto with a fried egg on top. OMG! It brought me back to my Filipino days when I used to have fried egg and rice with Sarap Sauce (Filipino version of ketchup). It is a filling dish, but man does it hit the spot!  I think this is a lovely, hidden gem of a place. The patio is not facing directly onto Jarvis, but onto a quiet side street so it's a piece of tranquility in the middle of the city. I noticed that there were many people having drinks at the bar inside, so it can be a nice business-meeting-drinks place as well.  I don't know if I would come out of my way here, but I really had a good time. Service was friendly and accommodating and the food was good!"}
{"text":"This hotel was ok. I stayed there for 3 nights. The restaurant is probably their saving grace. The a girl team of staff running the show I called them Charlie's Angels. They worked so well together, as a sat at the bar and observed their collaborations. Dinner was good. Fast and tasty. Mushroom salad was yummy; half chicken was cooked well. I had a comp glass of wine. Breakfast was ok but given that it is free I can't complain. I only wish they would use fresh scramble eggs instead of the premade type. I know because the texture is different from regular fresh scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"The Citrus is a typical mid class hotel bar area that also serves food. In the morning the area is where you gather for the buffet breakfast included with your hotel stay. The breakfast is varied and they do keep the area clean and fill the food trays often. I did find the scrambled eggs each of the several days stay to be very low quality as they were very dry. I recommend adding the salsa to it and and the home fries to give them a little flavor and moisture. The wait staff is pleasant and my party of five were always seated quickly regardless if we came down at 7 or  9 am. The waters can be a little over zealous in cleaning up the plates as they will take your plate if you get up for a coffee and leave it on the table. Additionally if you are finished with your food be sure to hold on to your flatware or they will take it. It's easy enough to get more but why chance it. In the evening the area becomes a dimly lit bar area with pleasant waitresses and bartenders. There are plenty of areas away from the bar to sit and have a drink and chat or watch a match on one of the TVs. Be mindful to ask the prices of the drinks especially the wine before ordering ."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Had dinner there last night with my family after an 8 hour drive to Toronto and let me tell you, it was a little slice of heaven sitting on the beautiful patio drinking a delicious gin cocktail, eating the \"destination\" warm mushroom salad, and then savoring the melt in your mouth lamb meatball with fresh spinach pasta. I could eat dinner every night here and just eat my way through the menu.   The hubby and 14 year old had sushi, which they said was fresh and just as good as the sushi at Akai Hana, where we live in Columbus, Ohio. We gauge all sushi against Akai Hana sushi.   The 13 year old had a club sandwich with fries and aioli, which I told her was similar to ranch dressing. She gave it two thumbs up. Beautiful presentation for a sandwich platter.   I never have high expectations for hotel restaurants but this one blew me away. Our pretty, helpful server DAYNA made us feel right at home and was always there when we needed her. The complimentary assorted bread basket is served with this crazy delicious carrot spread and butter. It sounds odd but even the teens were loving it. I say- just go there and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the wonderful staff at Citrus for their excellent service. We were running late for a flight, and they accommodated us with fast service, this during the lunch rush. Maitre D Grant was fantastic and kind. And did we mention the food was delicious! Try the Gravlax w poached egg and the mushroom salad."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere.  Friendly service.  The sushi surprisingly good.  Prices reasonable.  I only wish they opened until at least 1am."}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet I've every had. Very modern/eclectic decor. Absolutely beautiful. Love it here!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant located on the first floor in our hotel in Toronto. It is where they serve complimentary breakfast in the morning, but in the evening it is a full fledge bar and lounge and  restaurant. We came in after a long day at airports etc. Service was very fast as the place was not busy at all. Perk of traveling off season. We were brought some delicious assortment of bread and butters. With a cup of coffee, that would have been OK for me, but of course I wanted to try some French Onion soup!!   I ordered my soup and it was divine! Service was also great.  We had planned to come back later on for dinner. it was about five in the afternoon when we came in at first, but we were just too tired and fell right to sleep. If you are staying at the hotel this is a great place to have drinks and some quick bites. I wouldn't come in from the street just to eat here, but it does the job as hotel restaurant. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again, and here for sure."}
{"text":"My family was in Toronto overnight and this place was recommended by a friend of mine from the area. The service was fantastic and the caesar salad was impeccable. The caesar dressing had a beautiful flavor and texture! My grandmother thoroughly enjoyed her meringue dessert."}
{"text":"Beautiful rustic/modern combo decor, love it! The service is empicable, one time the waiter came too soon for the check but that was it. The server are very respectful and friendly, been here for breakfast so far.im trying lunch right now, presentation is exquisite. Feeling the upscale ambiance!"}
{"text":"Citrus is a restaurant located within and being a part of The Grand Hotel & Suites. The seating and atmosphere is definitively upscale with top notch service and full wide ranging menu. The food is imaginative as well as innovative with offerings like a Bouillabaisse Capellini composed of Nova Scotian Cold Water Lobster, Mussels and White Shrimp with Braised Fennel, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes and Chili Bread Crumbs, and one of my favorite mains, being a Pistachio Crusted Lamb Rack with Rosemary Goat Cheese Mash, Parmesan Shallot Crisp and Natural Reduction. In particular, their Bouillabaisse is one of the best around, thick and fully flavorful.   Best off is the seating arrangements which offer both indoor dining or within a sort of garden like atrium area."}
{"text":"Very quietly restaurant and very friendly service. The Golden seafood chowder has some fried crisp bacons.It's very delicious! The Warm mushroom salad is also great!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night to celebrate friends birthday here. Unfortunately he has gluten and wheat allergies. Two waiters and a manager clustered around the table unable to really figure out what he could or could not order.they made it uncomfortable and complicated and ultimately served him food with wheat in it which caused an allergic reaction...  His tenderloin was done to perfection. I ordered the pork belly and scallops appetizer. Very small portionand a three out of five. My main was the pistachio crusted lamb. Excellent portion and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately the spice in the crust was so powerful I couldn't taste the lamb.  The apple tart for dessert was two out of five at best.  Our waitress tried, but overall it was a less then notable experience."}
