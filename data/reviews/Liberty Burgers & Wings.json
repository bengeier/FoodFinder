{"text":"We came here to try this place out not hoping to be blown away but the quality was really not that great after all. We ordered the calamari to start ($9.95), cheese burger ($5, regular $10.95), 1lb wings (11.95), side of fries ($6.95, which we thought was wayyy too expensive for what it was) and 2 bottles of water ($1.55/each).    The calamari came out nice and hot but the batter was on the saltier side and the calamari tasted rubbery.  My husband and I did not fight for it at all considering we were both pretty hungry.     The cheese burger came open faced and you can see right away they were not very generous with toppings. I am ok with that considering I only paid 5 bucks but if I paid full price then i'd be pretty disappointed.  I shared this with my husband and we both agreed that 5 Guys (also in Markham, in similar price range) had much better burgers.   The dry wings we ordered was the best thing we had all night.  They were nice and hot and crunchy.  The sauce on the side was also quite nice.  However, the fries we ordered on the side didn't take long to get soggy.  The portion was quite big but it wasn't good enough for us to finish it all. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was $6.95.   A lot of people complained about the bottled water but I wasn't too bothered by it. If your food is good, I'd order bottled water.     I can understand this is a small establishment and cutting cost is a big thing to help run the business. However, management needs to understand that there are competitions in the area and they need to step up to stay in business. I don't think I will be back anytime soon but when I do, hopefully I'll have a better review for them."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch. Place is small but the atmosphere is wonderful...food was top notch...we got wings and the smokehouse burger.definetly worth another visit!!!"}
{"text":"They refuse to serve tap water despite my party's over $90 in orders (for 5 people).   They will only serve bottle water which we all know is environmentally unfriendly.  An $8 shake is about half the size for most shakes elsewhere.  Will never be back here."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars Given the price was greater than $10 for main dish on the menu, the food is nothing better than average. I'm not saying it's bad, but I feel as if the portions and quality of the food was not as good as the price. I had the cheeseburger, and it came with home fries. It was all fresh but the home fries were too salty. Also water is charged at $1.55 a bottle, absolutely not worth it. I would recommend eating somewhere else.  Note,  Main St. Markham was under heavy construction so traffic was limited to one way and parking was limited."}
{"text":"Was in the Markham area to Asian grocery shop, and decided to stop in for a bite to eat with the BFF. Four o'clock ish Saturday afternoon, whilst a street festival was happening, so it was a challenge getting onto Main Street North, but after we arrived, it was well worth it. We were served by Alex M., whom totally rocks it in the customer service dept. Attentitive, Efficient & Friendly :) We ordered Rolling Rock pale ale ... refreshing! I had the Smokehouse Burger, which was yummy, but bacon cooked a lil longer next time please.  Thank-you.  The fries were done nicely.  No salt as per my request, dry, crispy & NOT soggy in oil.  They got it right here! The bbf had the Holli Guacomole burger, which he found very delicious.  All toppings on the burgers were fresh & tasty. Onto the wings.  We had 1lb each of the Smokey Parm & Spicy Smokey BBQ.  Both were tasty & meaty.  Even the veggie sticks were fresh & crunchy.  In summary, we're fans due to these reasons.  Food temperature was served HOT! ... straight from kitchen to table ... Fries ... well you know how I feel about that from my previous reviews, & NO bleach taste on the beer glasses! They're doin something right here!"}
{"text":"Went here to get for Yelp's Burger Week with a friend. Got the Smokehouse burger for $5 - no fries though. To be honest, it was a delicious burger, one of the best I've had in a while. The patty was super juicy and all the components worked very well together. Each bite was something different, but every bite was delicious!   The lower rating is because of their service today. It was simply too slow! It took an entire hour before I got my burger. We waved down a waitress after forty minutes and she said it would be very soon, and that there was a delay with our order. It took twenty minutes between when she said that and until we got our food. It wasn't even particularly busy, which irked me the most. I would be more understanding if the place was packed, which it wasn't.  I'd still come back for another try simply because the food was so great. Hopefully they were just having an off day with the service."}
{"text":"For me, burgers are 'meh' on any given day, so they will never in any instance merit 5 stars; they're the 'I'm hungry, but I dunno what I want and I'm feeling apathetic' food. So, it was without anticipation that I tried Liberty for the first time. I have visited a few times and haven't yet been completely disappointed; I believe the patties are made in-house, as is the delicious signature sauce. So, pretty good. My only request would be a toasted bun. The calamari here is the BEST I've ever had; a nice big pile, and lightly seasoned (served with lemon and spicy-sweet Thai sauce). Fries are always a serious business - these are a 7.5/10. There's an ok selection of wing sauces; last time I visited the wings weren't great, unfortunately :S  Still, the pricing is fair, the interior is quite sleek, and the menu is modest: ten or so burger choices, a bunch of wing flavours and salads. You can, however, add additional burger toppings at an extra charge."}
{"text":"I found myself craving a California chicken burger, so when I googled a burger place in Markham, I found the menu for Liberty Burgers & Wings and decided to give it a shot.  Just last weekend, we experienced the heaven that is 5 Guys Burger in Scarborough, so Liberty had some big shoes to fill, but based on the reviews on Yelp, I figured it was worth a try.  For a warm Friday evening, there was only 1 waitress and 1 cook in the kitchen.  The place was filled to capacity inside (only seats 20-25 inside) and outside on the patio.  The 2 tables around us placed their order at the same time as us, but they had clearly been there awhile before we got there.  For some reason our order arrived first.  We felt a bit guilty eating our burgers while they sat there waiting for another 20 minutes for theirs to arrive.  The table behind us waited so long they threatened to walk out.  I found the service very disorganized.  The 1 lone waitress was scurrying around attending to all the tables by herself, at the same time playing the role of busboy, server, bartender, and cashier.  While there were 2 \"management\" type people wandering around, serving the occasional plate or two of food or standing behind the computer, while tables around us glare into the open kitchen tapping at their watches.  My husband wanted a green salad instead of fries.  The green salad never made it onto his plate, but it did make it onto our bill. The extra charge was promptly removed.  My California chicken burger craving was not satisfied.  The Holli Guacamole burger I got was way overpriced ($16.95!) for a piece of chicken that tasted like it was merely steamed rather than cooked on an open flame.  The burgers were OK - but both my companions agreed 5 Guys has the juicier meat.  In the end, Liberty delivered just average food, high prices, and slow disorganized service. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Went on Thursday at lunch time and ordered the Canuck burger with a side of fries.  The the toppings on the burger was plentiful and quite nice, very well put together.    The fries were a bit stale similar to a skinny cut version of New York fries.  Overall it was quite a nice burger and fries combo.  One thing that left a mildly bitter taste in my mouth was the fact that the restaurant did not offer tap water.  Now I understand that some higher end restaurants do this, but this was not a fancy restaurant by any sorts.  This is typically a red flag for some restaurants that find any way to make the profit margin.  Another flag could be the cash only sign and \"ATM Inside\" option.  Needless to say any restaurant that chooses making a quick and easy profit from charging for water and forcing patrons to pay for their own ATM surcharge is selling their service and product short.  No matter how great the food has potential to be, unnecessary charges detracts from the overall experience.  Overall the service was good and we will like to try this place again if we are craving burgers in the area."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot, on Main St.  Good but not great basic burger.  The wings are good, but it's more about the gourmet sauces.  Personally, when it comes to wings I rather have a good basic wing, rather then the fancy sauces.  If you are familiar with All Stars wings, this is similar but nicer.  If you rather just a good basic wing drive over to Unionville Pub & Arms."}
{"text":"This plqce is wayyyyy to small not enough seating and the prices are ridiculously high its outrageous,  will I ever return probably , the burgers are amazing"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: When we were seated, half of our party ordered pitchers of the recommended beer and some of the ladies asked for water to start. We were told that there was a policy that they would not serve water, only bottled for $1.55 or $3 sparkling. Ridiculous. This has nothing to do with race (anyone who says so is being RACIST and ignorant), nor does it have anything to do with spending. We brought a party of 10 all ordering alcoholic beverages and food. There was NO reason why we would not get water. Even despite that, tap water should be free.  So first and foremost with the cheapskate price gouging, Liberty made a poor first impression. After they brought the pitchers, the waitress finally brought a glass of water and said that we will get it for free because we are ordering alcohol (wow, how generous of you, ha). But we had to ask for additional glasses of water and even glasses for the alcohol.  When it comes to the food, I ordered the sliders, my husband had the Central Park burger which came with sweet potato fries. Burgers were decent, sweet potato fries were good if you used the dipping sauce. Nothing remarkable, but it wasn't terrible as some previous reviewers stated. You can definitely find better food elsewhere.   Facility: Located on Main St. Markham (west side) across from St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, we were seated on the patio which was satisfactory.  Service: Service was average. Nothing special to note.   Overall: I think this is a big mistake on the restaurants part to start off your customer's experience with water hoarding. I hope the economic value of your absurd stingy water policy was worth losing patrons because we certainly would not be returning. Good luck when someone keels over drunk or from dehydration. Lawsuit, anyone?"}
{"text":"Came here for burgers and lots of potatoes! The burger was OK, the poutine was lacking cheese curds, the wedges were HUGE and plentiful. It was almost if a bag of sliced potatoes were sitting on my plate. One thing I encourage everyone to try is there sweet potato fries. They were delicious--much better than other places I've been to.   Service was fast and our server was attentive. Warning: If you are ordering a glass of water they will bring you bottled water instead."}
{"text":"1. I've read a lot of reviews and tips about how they charge for water by the bottle - it costs $1.55. So it forces you to order a pop for $2.55 or an alcoholic beverage. Once, I sat down and ordered water I was told that water was charged by the bottle. As I was eating, two girls came in and ordered water and got it for free... and in a cup. They did not order any other drinks.  2. Ordered wings with hot honey sauce - it was neither hot or honey flavoured.  3. Also ordered a burger - it was OK. Not the best burger I've had but not the worse either. I didn't care for a whole wheat bun but the waitress must've heard wrong cause they charged me $0.95 for the upgrade.  4. Nothing on the menu comes with a side. The staff don't tell you that fries and salads are extra. They'll just ask \"what you would like for your side\".  5. Considering how it's not busy during dinner time on the patio on a nice summer day. It was still nearly impossible to get any help from the waiters/waitresses.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed. Great homemade fresh burger. Will be going back again for sure. So happy I finally found a good burger in Markham."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location - just along Main St Markham where there are other shops. It is always a nice walk along the street.   I can't find decent burgers in Markham. This place is the best I could find so far. However, my favourite burger places are still Burger Priest and Harvey's (yes Harvey's). The meat itself was on the drier side. However, I really liked the toppings (goat cheese and really crispy bacon).   Th fries were alright. I upgraded to a poutine but found that some of the fries were a bit underdone.   As other people noted. This place is on the more expensive side (about 15 dollars for the burger).   Two odd things about this place. First, they only served bottled water. When we requested just regular tap water, the waiter mentioned that they serve only bottled. He didn't end up charging us for it though. Second, the place was completely empty (about 2pm). My husband and I asked to sit in one of the booths (which sits 4ppl and fair enough we were only 2ppl). The cook said, we had to sit at the table closer to the window. When I asked why, he said that they already set up the booth to seat four (meaning, there were 4 napkins and forks on the table, which I thought would be easy to just remove 2 especially if we asked). Anyways, we ended up sitting near the window. About 40 mins later, we were done eating and the place was still completely empty.  That was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"The food here turned out to be very delicious. I say that because of the mild disappointment experienced during Burger Week, and because my friend just wanted to satisfy her \"patio on a good day\" cravings.  I wish I discovered this place earlier...    We ended up sharing the original Hamburger with their liberty sauce (ah - the special sauce, you can't have \"burger\" in your name unless you got this) with the side of home fries; and also Smokey Parm wings (a mix of Medium, BBQ, and parm cheese sprinkled on top - sadly, this isn't Gar-Par with a mix of Medium and BBQ, but hot sauce w/ gar par, and gar par are flavours).   Here's the run down...  Burger - juicy, and delicious. My friend and I absolutely LOVED this!! Even the PLAIN \"Hamburger\" was good, I wonder what the other burgers would be like. From the menu, they said it's freshly prepared, organic meat. But who cares about that detail - it was damn tasty. :D  Side of fries - thick cut fries. I was hoping for more of that \"potato\" taste, but they were still pretty good, crispy and devoured happily.   Wings - yum. Slightly crispy on the outside from the deep frying, hot, and flavourful. I wish there was a bit more cheese, but I guess you can always ask for more! $9.99 for 1 lb so the price is really like any other wing place. But what looked like a regular pub, the variety of flavours they offered for their wings was amazing!  (I'm so tired of pubs offering only the usual bbq, medium, honey garlic, etc...)   Beer on tap - Alexander Keiths/Shock Top, ranged from 5.99 to 6.99. Would be nice if there was more variety but we liked what was there...  Others: On a Wednesday evening, there were like 2 people at the bar, 2 or 3 tables inside, and around 2 tables outside. The patio is nice; there are hanging potted plants as well and just a decent atmosphere. It seemed very family-friendly as well as there is a kids menu and there were definitely a handful of kids there.  Sadly, there aren't any \"-day\" specials, as per the staff, since their place is still fairly new, but hopefully they'll have something like that in the future, since I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If you want to pay for water and get bad service, swing by Liberty Burgers!! I heard that they had really good burgers, but they were a bit pricey. I heard right about the burgers being pricey. But were the burgers really good? More like mediocre. I got the classic cheddar burger and the burger was juicy but some parts of the burger were quite tough. The bun was un-toasted so it quickly became soggy. The fries weren't that bad, but not spectacular.  Now onto the service, she was very slow with our orders, bringing our food, getting our bills and she didn't even get a glass for one of my friends when he ordered water. She just handed him a water bottle. She didn't tell us about the extra adds on available and that it would cost more if we substituted for a whole wheat bun. My meal of the classic burger and water came up to about $20. I wouldn't come here again. You can get a very good burger at burger's priest downtown for less than that. I would rather commute downtown than come here. I'm very disappointed :("}
{"text":"I've recently begun to explore the recently renovated Markham Main Street (the Markham Village, if you will) and have become quite fond of its small community of businesses and specialty shops. Similar to that of a Unionville in terms of age and historical significance to the City of Markham, but more akin to a Port Credit in terms of size and breadth of businesses, it's an area I'm eager to explore more and more, especially after my recent visit(s) to Liberty Burger & Wings!  Located in small retro-fitted house on the Main Street of Markham, Liberty Burger has an appealing patio outside for warmer months but a cozy seating area and bar inside that's good all year round.  The owner, Aidan, is a class act guys and most times when you visit it'll be him working the counter and cooking up your meal. He's passionate about the food he puts out so ask him a question about how something is made and he'll gladly go into proud detail for you.  My last visit I left my lunch decision completely up to Aidan and told him to give me his favourite or most popular burger, with little hesitation he recommended the local fave, Smokehouse burger!  I took my seat and once the burger was freshly made it was cooked to my specifications and was outstanding (and hella juicy). Topped with sauteed onions, mushrooms and a smokey BBQ sauce, I was in Burger heaven after only a few bites.  My meal came with a choice of salad or fries and while opting for the salad, I was not disappointed with the massive portion of greens that accompanied my burger - almost too much to finish.  I've yet to try one of their over 30 varieties of homemade wings that are made fresh to order either breaded (or not) at time of order. Aidan emphasized that their wings are never frozen, so I am anxious to return and give them a whirl.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Regular visitor of this place. The owner is super friendly and engaging. Food is always good. Always trying to support my locals food places. My favourite is the avacado burger with a poutine. The fries are made from Yukon gold potatoes. I have tried everything from apps to entrées. Never been disapp ointed."}
{"text":"I once walked by this place and dismissed it because it looked boring from the outside. I wholeheartedly regret that decision after coming here during my burger binge week visit!! They were offering the Smokehouse burger for $5 for the Yelp GTA Burger Week, and at an original price of $13.50 it was such a goood deeaaaal. It had caramelized onions, peppercorn sauce and smoked cheddar. For me the peppercorn sauce was the star of the burger. So flavourful without being overpowering or salty, the sauce really brought the whole burger together for me. I also really like the fresh veggies in the burger for the simple fact that they actually tasted really fresh and made me feel less guilty about the state of my narrowing arteries. The buns were also awesome and did not dissolve into messy oblivion with the peppercorn sauce!  The #bestbossever also treated me to some sweet potato fries to share and THEY WERE THE BOMB! Sooooo crispy on the outside, and the sauce that came with it also had the perfect kick of cinnamon and spice to compliment the taste of the sweet potato.   I intend on coming back to try more of their burgers, sides, and oh yea they apparently do great wings too. So yea. I basically have to come back for everything!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I drove past this restaurant daily and finally decided to try it. I arrived on a Thursday for dinner and surprised the place was rather empty. The restaurant is on the smallish side but there is additional seating outside. I think all the construction on Markham street is probably keeping people away as the other restaurants in the area were dead as well.   I thought the food was good as far as burgers and wings go. The menu just had burgers (either beef or chicken) and about 30 types of wings and a few appetizers. Service was fast and friendly. Prices were maybe slightly above average on the burgers. I tried the following:  - Spicy buffalo wings. They were really good, lot's of meat on the bone but not very spicy.   - Peppercorn Chicken burger was really good but a bit pricey at $16  - My friend had the beef burger which they enjoyed as well  Limited bar menu, I had a few Shock Top pints with my meal.   The atmosphere improves immensely when there is a band / musician playing. The patio becomes a \"party\" spot. I would go back when I'm in the mood for burger/wings but the limited menu limits frequent visits.  BK"}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in Markham Village (with all due respect to Tom's). The bison burger in particular is great.  The ribs are also quite good here.  The atmosphere is great, but this is a TINY restaurant, so seating could be an issue for a larger group. It's a bit better in the summer as there is some outdoor seating.  There are several beers on tap."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night with a few friends... it wasn't super busy but there were enough tables filled to give the waitress a hard time and cause service to be incredibly slow. Pretty sure we spent more time sitting there waiting for the bill than we did enjoying our meal. Definitely understaffed.   A few turn-offs from the very beginning: 1. You have to pay for bottled water. Ask for tap water, and you'll get a snarky reply that they only sell water by the bottle. No tap water for you, sorry. 2. Slow service. Had to wait a while before we were given our menus.  There's not a lot of menu options...this IS a burger & wings place, so I can't really complain about their menu only having, well, burgers and wings, but my biggest problem is that their burgers are NOT made to impress, especially for the price. I ordered their regular Liberty burger with a side of mixed greens...when it arrived, the chefs had accidentally switched my burger with a friend's plate who had ordered a side of fries. The waitress then attempted to try and swap the appetizers/burgers around by sliding the food, and then asking me to move my own burger because she was not allowed to touch the food herself. Not the best way to serve a customer her dinner. Worse yet, I had actually been given the more expensive Greek salad, which I realized only AFTER getting the bill.   The burger itself was really unimpressive. The bun was not toasted (really bummed about this actually) and on the tough-looking patty sat a few meagre toppings; tomato, lettuce, pickles, nothing else. No sauce. The burger wasn't put together, and just looked kind of sad on the plate. I really could have just gone home, done a 5 minute grocery shop at Walmart, and made a better burger for myself. So many regrets.   Never going back here again."}
{"text":"Any restaurant on a main street is definitely worth trying. This burger place is my third instalment for Yelp's Burger Binge Week, and it was definitely a good one!   Located right in the middle of Main Street Markham, in between 16th and Highway 7, this small burger and wing joint is definitely worth a visit. With only about 6 tables inside, but a large patio area, it has a full bar and open kitchen as well.   We got a Yelp Burger for Binge Week, and was an awesome Double Cheese Burger with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. With tomato, lettuce, and pickle as well, making this a beautiful gourmet burger!  Favourite thing about Liberty would definitely be that they have Summersby on tap! So delicious and perfectly refreshing for the summer!  Will definitely be back to try their wings, as we saw them on another table, and they looked absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Small place but don't let that fool you! Food was awesome...should have worn track pants."}
{"text":"My second visit to Liberty Burger and Wings. Both times I left disappointed. I was hoping to find a good burger joint close to home. The food is average, neither great or terrible. Within the same price range for the GTA, I much prefer Hole-E burger or the Burgers Priest.  My negative review is largely based on my experience with management, not the food itself.  1) They refuse to serve tap water. Even with the purchase of two burgers, a poutine and soda, you cannot get a water unless you purchase a bottle. There are no other water options available. The tap water in the city is safe to drink and this is simply another way to gouge money from paying customers.   2) It took over 45 minutes to receive a menu and place our food orders. Because of the slow pace that was set from the beginning, we informed the restaurant that we were in a bit of a rush in hopes of avoiding future delays with the food. One burger finally arrived but the other was forgotten. The manager came to our table and asked how everything is and I shared my disappointment.  He said he predicted we would complain because we mentioned we were in a bit of a rush (if a 1.5 hour dining experience is considered rushing). He said \"if you want quick food then you could go to mcdonalds.\" I completely understand that a chef wouldn't want to jeopardize the food quality by rushing an order, but there was NO rushed pace reflected to put the food out, the food quality didn't exactly reflect time and care either.  3) When the second and forgotten burger finally arrived, served open faced, we noticed a short, curly hair on the tomato slice. We brought it to the manager's attention and he implied that is was our own doing and he said \"once there is one complaint, more and more keep coming.\" Incase you all aren't aware of it, we get a thrill from sabotaging our own food when really hungry after a long wait. I can't help it. The manager did not offer to do anything, I requested that we pay for the food and beverages we did consume and sent the tainted burger back. 1.5 hours wasted.  All in all, my recent visit to Liberty Burger and Wings was bad enough for me to take the time out of my day to share this. Maybe my experience is an isolated incident. Regardless, management was rude and became immediately defensive when approached in a non-confrontational manner.  I will note that some online reviewers seem to have positive experiences at this restaurant.  Give it a try if you would like to, but I certainly know that I will not be back both because of how management handled the situation and because the food is average."}
{"text":"I love burgers BURGERS BURGERS! Came here with all the other yelpers, thanks for organizing! Love to see familiar faces! I came here with high expectations, I mean how can you go wrong with a burger? It's a Burger! They all just taste great!! However, after looking around the sad burgers they were serving to their customers I decided to opt for wings. You know it's a bad start when you look around and they look like sad burgers... I don't think that has ever happened to me before............  Anyway, I can't really complain about the burger since I didn't get it - but the wings were... alright. They were huge though. The blue cheese dipping way too watery.   Water! Come onnnnnnnn! Why are you charging me water?!?! Yes I am Asian and I am not happy that you are forcing me to buy a drink. We ended up ordering a pitcher of beer, but I ALSO NEED WATER and I don't want to pay $1.55 for BOTTLE OF WATER!!!! I love to chug beer all day, but I'm also dehydrated from the over salted wings, watery blue cheese, and not fresh veggies. I'm not at a theme park where everything is jacked up in price. I'm at a nice main-street Markham restaurant. Why are you hoarding water?! Hoarders.   Also 20% gratuity really? We had a group of 12 people...even high end restaurants charge only 18%.   Space is small, so not for large groups. Area is nice for a nice walk after dinner. Over priced dinner. SO not worth it. Never return.  Owners/servers nice."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the level of service. The server was polite but not helpful.  Ordered a water to drink and was told that they only do water in bottles. We ordered the yelp burger and were asked if we wanted fries with them. We both asked for fries on the side. When our order came we both got full size fries to go with our burgers. Suffice it to say when the bill came, our $5 burger meal totalled $35 before tip. They also do not do vicinity points despite having the sign up more than once. Burger was not bad but nothing special."}
{"text":"Tried the Smokehouse burger during Burger Binge week. For $5 it was a really good burger (Reg $14). I wasn't a real fan of the bbq sauce but everything was real fresh with a substantially large & good quality patty. A nice place on Main St."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere and the food was great was so filling I couldn't finish :-) coming back with more people and especially son."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I am still not convinced by the food here, hence the reason I'm keeping it at 2 stars. My previous 3 star review was removed by Yelp HQ, upon the request of the restaurant owner.  Where do I start this time? Coming back for seconds, I think I can put a solid score for this place, no bias or discrepancies. The first time I had the cheese burger, fries and beer and I was not entirely impressed. This time I had the Central Park, something that's supposed to scream \"quality\" over the regular cheese burger (I would assume the quality be served to me whether I ordered something expensive or cheap?). Like I said before, this burger did not impress me. It had a relatively thick patty, but considered thin if this place was all about the gourmet burgers. The patty was slightly overcooked, but most of it was covered by the onion ring, blue cheese and sautéed mushrooms so it's hard to tell in the picture. It was juicy in some spots but dried out in some. The fries, though it came out nice and golden, was still overcooked just like my first visit. I also ordered my beer to wash down the food, so that was the best part. I keep thinking in my head, I paid $16 for the burger alone.. With beer around $20 not including taxes + gratuities. Is this what a gourmet burger combo/meal is supposed to be?  The most unfortunate part of my visit is the realization that I made a mistake by coming here again instead of driving further north and dine at The King's Landing or Main Street Burger Shoppe in Stouffville. Not to mention they don't charge serving water. Even if they did charge for water, it'll be a dollar less. It's not a problem with me bc I like my burger with beer anyway.  Service was fine, but not spectacular and managing a business, especially an eatery has its challenges. 2 stars for managing and maintaining this place, 0.5 for food on the second try."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I really wanted to try this place with my friends. It was one of our to-do items on our summer bucket list and I'm so glad we went!  I ordered the veggie burger and twas perfect! The patty was not dry at all and the bun was soft, but not too soft! I usually don't order fries, but this time, it was a choice I didn't regret! I finished every last fry :) My friends ordered the cheddar burger and they loved their meals too!  Just something to keep in mind: if you order water, they will give you bottled water which you will have to pay for ($1.55)"}
{"text":"Went for the music festival where they set additional seating in street.  They create a special menu for speed during festival, I would guess it's the best sellers.   Very fast service and good food, guessing limited menu contributed to this.    Been many times during regular service since site a local place for me, confused in the negative reviews? Yelp has created a demanding environment for a $15 meal.    Either way always a pleasure."}
{"text":"If I could give it a no star I would. I'm kind of ticked off on how much I feel RIPPED OFF coming to this place.  Water isn't free it is $1.55 for a bottle and they don't tell you in advance when you ask for water. This is just pathetic scam strategy.   Second I ordered the holli guacamole burger expecting it to be good since there is a good amount of rage about it. I regret every single bit of that plate of dry tasteless plain burger I intaked into my stomach.  The patty was TASTELESS. The guacamole was COLD and the onions were sliced way too THICK AND UNCOOKED.  I also ordered blue honey chicken wings. It was nothing special and didn't taste much blue cheese what so ever.  I can't emphasize on how DISAPPOINTED I WAS LEAVING THIS JOINT!  Two dishes plus water bottles I was left with paying close to 40 dollars for this shit meal. I will never come back."}
{"text":"I have been here once before for wings before I started Yelping and it wasn't bad, so considering it has been a few years since my last visit and it has survived, it can't be that bad.  But it was.  From what I remembered, the restaurant is quite small, so I called to make a reservation and to ensure the large number of us. When I called, someone answered but I was passed on to someone else when I asked if I could take a reservation. The person who took my reservation had to check with someone if they can accommodate 14 people, and that person she checked with sounded a lot like the person who originally answered the phone. I had to call back the next day to add two more seats because I miscalculated the number of people attending, and they confirmed my changed reservation.   When I arrived to the restaurant at 7:30pm for my 7:30pm reservation, they were just putting tables together. This is when they also approached me to tell me that normally they charge a 20% gratuity on large groups, but as long as everyone orders at least one drink, they won't charge the 20%. Wait, you couldn't tell me that when I called your restaurant twice? And who do you think you are charging 20% gratuity?  Anyway, moving on.  I ordered a water because I don't really drink anything else other than water, they don't serve tap water apparently, so I stuck to a bottle of water. They also apparently don't have glassware because you don't get one unless you order a pitcher of beer.   Checked in on Yelp to get the Yelp burger special, the Yelp Burger week page had listed Liberty Burgers will be offering their burger with cheddar AND mozzarella, a double-cheese burger, I had imagine that it would be almost like a pizza but on a burger, but alas I never got to taste it because either Yelp GTA Community Manager made something up (highly unlikely) or they decided to change it after registering their participation with Yelp to get more people to go. What was served to me and others who ordered the same was a single-cheese burger, with slice of cheddar on top of a burger patty that was far smaller than the bun.  I also ordered the Liberty Potato Wedge, which on their menu reads \"hand cut, big, thick and crispy\", what the menu should have read was \"hand cut, big, thick and salty\" because not only were they not crispy, they were too salty and it was like eating an overly salted whole potato. It was boring and I lost interest in them after two pieces. It was not worth $7.95.   The cheese burger is a regular menu item that normally costs $10.99 which comes with a side. I should have just got that instead since there was no difference from the Yelp burger to that. It would have saved a few dollars. Which isn't just an Asian thing, who would in their right mind would pay more money for the exact same thing?  I was unimpressed with this experience, I'm disappointed I selected this location to have dinner with friends so if you want quality food at reasonable prices, it's best you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I showed up here the other night at 10:30pm. The sign on the door said they closed at 10pm but they looked open so we went in. Even though they normally close at 10pm they had had a busy night and were still serving. We got a table and ordered. I ordered the Holli Guacamole burger meal with cajun fries and my wife got the parmasan wings (1 lb). The food was delicious and the service was super friendly. This place is pretty out of the way for us to go to regularly but we definitely want to go back. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"We came here to grab a bite to eat later in the afternoon on a Sunday.  The place was not busy and when we walked in it was hot as in no ac.  We decided to sit outside as the temperature was a bit more comfortable.  Our server took our drink orders and than gave us menus.  My friend decided to get their original burger.  She loved loved her burger.  I on the other hand decided to get their chicken fingers.  I found that my meal was a bit on the disappointing side.  It was literally 6 chicken tenders and a few celery and carrot sticks.  The redeeming fact is that the chicken tenders were just rightly seasoned and tasted fresh.  We found though that a lot of things were extra.  I mean $10 for chicken tenders and no fries.  My friend asked for mayo for her burger and fries and they said that's an extra $0.90.  It was a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"Had lunch here during the Markham Festival. Service was great. Ordered the $14 house cheese burger and fries to share with my daughter and it was very disappointing to be honest if your a burger joint your burger should be spectacular this was far from it. Burger was smaller than the bun which was a little stale, one piece of small tomato and some liberty signature sauce that we asked not to be on the bun. Very disappointed and was never asked how our meal was."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is friendly and prompt, the food is delicious and the prices are right. I would love to eat here daily if I could. I only give this restaurant a 4 star because I wish it wasn't in a different country!"}
{"text":"I ate here during the summer after seeing a Yelp promo for $5 burgers for their Burger Binge Week.  My friend and I got the Smokehouse Burger, and drinks in mason jars, and we enjoyed it on the patio. Caramelized onions,  a smoky burger patty with bbq sauce, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and pickles (the full-length ones - not the circle cuts). It was honestly really good but this place gets one star off because of very slow service. I think they actually might have forgotten about our order because we waited over an hour for two burgers to come out. Although the waiters are friendly, they were busy all the time and because we were on the side of the patio, they didnt come by often so it was harder to get their attention. We went out around 6-7pm on a nice and sunny evening so it was busy but it still would have been nice to get our food faster. Overall - great food and atmosphere - located on Main St. Markham.  I'd go here again (hoping for faster service! )."}
{"text":"If you are a follower of my reviews, you'd understand that I am always keeping it 100. No lies and brutal honesty are my values. Please keep that in mind as you read this review. This rating is completely towards the business and their practices.   The servers and owner was lovely to us that night, but clearly they're on some other level of their high horse- keep reading.. There was a thing where we HAD to either get a drink with our meal or be forced a 20% gratuity.. meh? Not feeling that but I understand that it's a common business practice so.. I didn't want to drink so I chose a water only to find out water is served in a bottle for $1.55? Why is this a business practice again? A really bad thing about this is that they don't inform you of the small charges they impose on you after you order something... Not cool! If I knew I would be paying for a drink anyway, I would've chosen something that I didn't assume was free. PS. We don't complain about water because we're asian, we complain because it's simply not a good business practice.  I got the wings in hail caesar (just because I don't really enjoy burgers) and they were alright- super big wings however taste was nothing special. Many members of our group didn't particularly enjoy their meal- the potato wedges were too bland but too salty at the same time, the yelp burger promised two cheeses but it only had one sad measly suspicious looking kraft singles slice on it.. good thing it was only $5! I recall only ONE single person that had enjoyed all their food. The only thing I did really like are the sweet potato fries, very crispy and soft on the inside. They were delicious.  Prices are a bit high, but it's normal for main street markham so no complaints there. The restaurant is also SUPER small inside.. with our group of 12-13 there, there were only 2-3 other tables open that could only hold 2-4 people. **The owner claims in his response to Teresa C that he \"lost business\" because we were there and only made $60 in total. First, there wouldn't have been that much business lost anyway because the place is rarely packed anytime I pass it, AND 100% of the tables on the patio were vacant.. so? Second, making only $60 on a large group is either a complete lie or he counted costs that should not be relevant to the consumer. Let's face it 12 people x $5 burgers each would equal $60. That alone is not counting tax/tip. PLUS, more than half the group did not even get the burger and instead opted for combos, other burgers and even got a number of sides such as potato wedges, sweet potato fries etc. AND most members of our group also had pitchers of beer or pints. My bill alone with tip and everything was $16.19 (yes, I went back to check after the outrageous statement. Picture attached) Simon C. and Rana L. beside me spent about $40 together on their bill. How this restaurant only made $60 on our large group just appalls me and the fact that they are blaming us for losing business.. what were we to you?  BONUS RANT**: Iwas reading through reviews for here, and the owner responded to somebody's honest review with this nasty response. \"10/29/2014 Sorry we where unable to satisfy you,first off our burgers start from $10. 2nd our fries and burgers are fresh and cut daily, so maybe you should keep sticking with your frozen food because you don't know what real quality tastes like. 3rd we have not once heard a bad feed back about our sweet potato yet but thanks for that feed back because we only strive to always do better and improve. 4th, again... You need to eat quality food before comparing us to franchise, because we have a small menu we specialize in what we got only. 5th you get what you pay for, I'm sure mc Donald is more in your budget and quality level\"  Excuse me!?!?! ^ This is completely unprofessional and uncalled for. I have never seen a business owner with the audacity to come at his customers in such a way. \"Keep sticking with your frozen food\" or \"I'm sure mcdonald is more in your budget and quality level\" just reminds me of poor jabs from bullies in elementary school. Just by seeing the way the owner responds to comments, it's easy to see how this place has so many low reviews. Maybe instead of coming at people directly, they should start listening to some of the reviews to change business practices- 10 people wouldn't complain about the same thing at different times for no reason.. hint hint. I understand large groups can ruin a business but so can bad attitude from the staff.  Because of these consequences and the poor mannerisms displayed online, I will not revisit this burger joint and will also advise all of my friends and followers on all social media to do the same."}
{"text":"Where do i start? The burgers are large & dry, no flavour. For a place that sells $13 burgers, it's a huge disappointment that their fries & onion rings are not freshly made, but frozen. I tried the sweet potato fries that everyone is raving about...i've had much better. Soggy, oily and obviously frozen. Too expensive and doesn't compare in taste to The Burger's Priest or Five Guys. Even Hero burgers & fries taste better!"}
{"text":"One star. Why?  1) no tap water. Really?  You're going to force me to pay 2.55 for fountain pop or whatever ridiculous price you charge bottled water?   2) we came in and it took forever to get served. The owner also committed the cardinal sin of taking another tables order before ours even though we got seated first AND we said we're ready to order (to which the owners response was \"I'm taking only drink orders first\").   3) burger came with untoasted fridge cold buns. Fries were over fried. Kids meal never came with the drink as advertised on menu.   4) burger itself was nothing to write home about. For a burger that costs on average of $15, I was expecting A LOT better.  Take your chances. YMMV"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after finding it on yelp and getting a checking coupon. When we went to order server had no idea about the yelp deal she had to go ask the manage. They did not honor the coupon.  We paid for or drinks and left. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Place is out of business now. One day in dec I walked by and windows were blackened out and lock box on door. This was a place that struggled and never believed in continuous improvements"}
{"text":"Decent burger. My first foray into poutine. Tasty beers on tap. Really good service and nice small place inside. Will be back on this trip and probably others."}
{"text":"I come to this place and ordered the cheese burger with pitcher of beer  ... The burger took some time but it was taste ... The place is nice were u can see the kitchen and the place which makes the place tight and cannot fit many people ...the beer was not as good as I expected ...  But over all nice experience and I will definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Markham for a hockey tournament he is coaching. We found Liberty Burgers & Wings online and it looked quaint so we decided to check it out for dinner. We were seated in a small table right near where the two cooks were cooking and a waitress waited on us immediately. My husband ordered a Hamburger that came with cheese, bacon and mushrooms-but he asked for NO Mushrooms. I ordered a Classic Cheddar but as a Chicken Sandwich not Burger (this is an option for all burgers). Mine was supposed to come with Chicken and Cheddar-clearly. When the food came, my husbands had mushrooms and mine had no cheese. The waitress proceeded to ask my husband if he wanted her to take it back-of course he did, he didn't want mushrooms. She took mine back as well. His came back first fixed-I think all they did was brush off the mushrooms. Mine came back with a slice of cheese thrown on-not melted at all. I figured whatever and cut my sandwich...at which point I realized it wasn't chicken now-it was a hamburger. So I called the waitress back over and the cook leaned over as well and asked \"what was wrong now\" I explained it was supposed to be chicken not a burger. He got snippy and said \"I already gave you chicken\" I said yes but without the cheese. So now they take it back again. This time I get my plate back with Chicken but on my already cut bun that the burger was on. I told the waitress and cook that I am not eating it like that. Now the cook yells at me \"but you're the one that cut it\" I said yes but it wasn't correct and that wasn't my fault. He then says \"fine you want a new bun\" and slams down a new bun onto the same plate with everything. I stood up and said I am not eating any of this and I am not paying for any of it. I don't deserve to be treated like this. There was no attempt to stop me, there was no offer to give me the meal for free or half price for all this hassle. The cook just continued to act like I was wrong. I have NEVER EVER been treated like this in a restaurant before. I was and am completely appalled by the service in this restaurant. That is definitely not how you treat a customer."}
{"text":"\"Great burger pub in a nice part of town on Main St., Markham\"  Tried this place 3 times and all 3 times it's been great.   I try a lot of burger pubs across the country and the US, and this one has the elements of being a very good burger joint.  The menu is great, they offer a good assortment and combinations of cheeses, bacon, mushrooms, and other gourmet toppings. Let me be clear, this place still has a ways to go, for starters, there needs to be more tables and a proper bar added. There should also be a lettuce wrap option or gluten-free bun option as well.   BUT, the food quality is good. All burgers, salads, fries are made-to-order. Would definitely go here again if I want to dine-in for a gourmet burger.  Again, the only thing wrong with the place is that it is absolutely tiny. If the place were bigger, it'd be a more vibrant atmosphere. But as far as getting dinner in the winter, this place is a great spot."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon for a quick bite. Wasn't busy at all with only one other table. No waiters where on site. Cook was the waiter which I found a little weird.  Cook was professional and polite, but damn it took him forever to make 2 burgers...That's one of the things that got me upset.  Main event came, and what a disappointment. I think the worst thing you can get is a DRY BURGER. Even the burgers at McDonalds or Burger King are juicy! I also splurged by upgrading my meal for a poutine. What a mistake. SALTY AS F&*K! Walked out of the place with a headache because of an overdose of sodium... Burger was a pure disappointment. Dry meat, flavourless burger and condiments. Please stay away from this joint.  For $17 a burger as an average price, there are so many other alternatives around the block.   Sorry Liberty, but this is the truth. Just giving my thoughts on my one and last visit to your joint."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place as my 2 favourite things to eat out are in the name 'burgers and wings'. I have to admit I didn't try the wings, but I did have a burger and was less-than-thrilled about it. It was ok, nothing spectacular. It was called the Madison Burger. The sauce on the burger was good. However, the bacon on it tasted very strange and seemed WAY over cooked. It killed the overall taste of the burger unfortunately.  Fries were good. My friend had the fried pickles and she said they were great.  Service was ok.   Apparently the bathroom was quite an adventure. My friend went to use the ladies room and had a very tough time with it as the lights were off and she couldn't find the switch. She had to wedge her shoe in the door to get a bit of light in there to use the facilities.   Although I didn't hate my experience at Liberty, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I was actually a little hesitant about trying this place as recent reviews have been somewhat low.  Decided to give them a go anyway and... not bad at all.  Parking is not the best and the staff seemed preoccupied with internal matters but the food was pretty good. Burger was juicy and well prepared, although they do have \"premium\" toppings which you gotta pay extra for.  I don't really consider jalapenos a premium topping myself. I did enjoy the fries as well and at the end of the meal I was sufficiently full.   worth a return visit if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Place was empty on a Wed afternoon so service was efficient. We were asked what kind of drinks and said water would be fine. What we ended up getting was two bottled waters which was $1.55 each. Sure business is tough and you gotta do what it takes to run a profitable business but this is not the way to do things and I'm sure I am not the first to complain about this.  Central Park burger $13.95 (Served With Sautéed Mushrooms, Peppercorn Sauce, Crumbled Blue Cheese & An Onion Ring). Sounds good on paper but I would avoid this burger at all cost. Blue cheese literally tasted like vomit. Maybe it was a bad batch or that's what blue cheese naturally taste like?  Holli Guacamole burger $15.95 (Served With Mozzarella Cheese, Liberty Signature Sauce, Lots Of Guacamole & Two Strips Of Bacon). No complaints. A very solid burger. Both burgers were really large and filling. Added $0.95 for Cajun seasoning for the fries which is totally worth it.  1lb blue honey wings $11.49 which is basically blue cheese and honey. Wings were awesome and did not have the blue cheese taste which was mentioned above. They were large and juicy and had a nice crispy outer layer.  Overall a great place to grab some comfort food."}
{"text":"+.5 for service.  I passed by this place last weekend and thought it would be an interesting place to try out. After searching this place on Yelp and noticing reasonable reviews, I decided to try this place tonight.  We started with a bottle of coke and a bottle of water. I've been skipping on carbonated water lately to maintain healthiness so I took the bottle of water and gave my dad the bottle of coke. In terms of food, we had the Ultimate burger with cajun fries, the Central Park burger with onion rings, and 1lb of blue BBQ wings.  The portions were gigantic! My dad is normally a huge eater and he only barely finished the burger and had only half of the fries. I finished by burger but didn't even touch my onion rings (okay...I had one). We did share and finished the wings, while tasty and juicy, lacked the blue cheese taste it was supposed to have. The burger, aside from quantity, was moderately juicy, and was very generous in terms of the ingredients (eg: my burger had mushrooms and blue cheese; the blue cheese I had was probably the size of a rubik's cube and the mushrooms were certainly plentiful).  Total came to around $56. A little higher than I expected considering we were a party of 2, though we did have to pack our fries and onion rings. I only realized after I checked in that they had the free fountain soda offer, but it was too late as I already had two drinks on the table. Oh well, next time.  Service was great. The guy (I assume the owner) was attentive to us the whole time (aside from the 2 minutes he was on the phone) and asked us if everything was okay. Nice guy too."}
{"text":"Dropped in to this Markham hotspot to take advantage of the $5 burger week promotion. Had a great chat with the owner and devoured their delicious cheese burger, (made with their special sauce).   It was so good, I actually ate the whole burger before I remembered to take a picture of it, (no joke. . . that good). Fast and tasty. . . Just how I like my burgers.   I admit I was in a bit of a rush when I stopped in, but I'm looking forward to visiting again with more time.   In conclusion: I had a nice visit to an awesome little burger joint. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered the poutine to go (had a craving and not many options up around there). I found myself looking for the cheese... It had some but I don't feel nearly enough for a $10 poutine."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The place was empty but the server and cook were chatting. I waited quite a while and finally had to interrupt them to order. The cook glared at me and the server was quite sarcastic when he finally came over. I ordered but then thought better of it and left. I have eaten there before and the food was ok. It's certainly not good enough to put up with that."}
{"text":"Was here for the Yelp Burger week and did not have a good experience AT ALL. Forced 20% gratuity for a larger group. Very poor customer service also.   I ordered the $5 burger special especially after the fact that we had to pay for ....gasp! water. It was a MAJOR turn off for me & I already didn't want to order anything else after that. While the patty was nice and juicy, the bun was a different story. I feel they could have at least toasted the bun lightly to give it a bit more texture. I felt like I was eating lunch in a cafeteria. It was also missing the so called advertised mozzarella cheese.  I got to try some fries (regular and sweet potato) and felt it could have been crispier.  Overall, I will NOT be coming back to Satan's little burger place again even if I were starving. Find something else around the area. Too much meat isn't good for you anyway."}
{"text":"We came here on July 29th and this place was so disappointing. The four of us ordered our food at the same time, but they forgot one of our meals. They made my sister wait and only started preparing her order after we got our meals. While they were apologetic, they offered nothing as a token. Also the food was terrible. My sister couldn't finish her burger because it was soaked in a terrible sauce. My house salad was stale and the chicken breast was far too salty. We definitely regretted not going to a nearby place instead."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could or less. We came here last minute because it was one of the only places open on Easter. They charged for bottles of water when we didn't ask for it. They provided zero service after taking our orders. The food was god awful and gave us queasy stomachs for the rest of the day. Avoid this place at all costs. Would never, ever come here again."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and have always found the food and service to be exceptional.  The wings are HUGE and meaty and our server Tara was very fast and friendly.  If you're looking for fresh food, nice atmosphere and reasonable prices I recommend them.  The restaurant is small so be prepared that you may have to wait for a seat.  If you come daytime sit outside, it's very relaxing!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Markham. Hands down.  Small shop with a nice patio on Main Street.  The quality is consistent, the buffers are done just right."}
{"text":"I really wanted to say that i enjoyed eating here. For a couple of reasons #1 it's SO close to my house & #2 Markham needs a great burger place. I was disappointed majorly on more than 1 occasion. I REALLY wanted a nice juicy burger that was seasoned right. I ended up with a dry burger with no great seasoning. You can have the best mix of beef, but if you don't know what to do with it or season it, well then you have a problem. I tried the sweet potato fries everyone has been raving about. I couldn't figure out what the raves were for? They tasted like average sweet potato fries. Maybe food tastes amazing when you're super hungry? I'm really surprised they have lasted as long as they have next to a bar/pub that sells burgers & just about everything else. Also didn't care for the fact that you have to pay for water at a sit down restaurant. If you're fast food or take out - i get it, but not when you sit down and wait for menus."}
{"text":"I reaaally wanted to give Liberty Burger & Wings a better rating, as I try to support businesses involved in Yelp Burger Week, but this place just made it too difficult to do so. I tried to come in with an open-mind, even after reading a lot of the concerns voiced in other reviews - unfortunately, most of the complaints about restaurant policies, service, and price-gouging seem to be totally on point.  SERVICE/POLICIES  1) To start the night, our large group of 10+ were required to each purchase a drink, or be automatically charged a 20% gratuity. This is much higher than the 16-18% typically charged for large groups at more upscale places then this, and more importantly, this policy was not communicated to us earlier when the reservation was initially made.  2) As already mentioned in several prior reviews, this place refuses to serve you water in a cup - if you want water, you're required to buy a bottle, even if you ordered beer/other drinks as well. I read about this unusual policy before coming, so I was not surprised like other customers have been - still a turnoff when this place refuses to offer what literally 99.9% of other restaurants do.  3) The server offered me the option of fries, sweet potato fries, or poutine to accompany my burger - it was stated exactly like that, as though they were all standard side options. I literally asked her \"oh, I can have poutine instead of regular fries??\" and was excited when she confirmed yes. Never did the server mention that I would be charged a $5 \"upgrade fee\" for the poutine - I only found this out when I received the bill.   4) Although I didn't order the Yelp burger special, I saw that the burgers served to other customers didn't come quite as advertised (no mozzarella). Part of the reason I didn't order the special is because it sounded more plain when the waitress listed ingredients than I remembered it described on Yelp - after another in our group checked the Binge Week page, it confirmed that Liberty Burgers just kind of decided to omit the mozzarella after the fact (probably the most expensive topping on an already relatively plain burger compared to other Burger Week offerings).   5) The server dropped two of those bottles of water on me. It was an accident, but still had to mention it though haha.   FOOD:  The food itself was decent, and I liked how they gave us frosted glasses to share our pitchers. Although the fries in the poutine were a bit cold, and tasted somewhat stale for some reason, the cheese was pretty good (oh THERE'S the mozzarella!). All together though, the \"Canuck burger\" I ordered (bacon, cheese, mushrooms) was not worth the $18 before tax, especially since the poutine had less fries then the standard side. Had I known there would be an extra charge stealthily slipped in, I would have just ordered a full order of poutine plus a single burger for a few dollars LESS then what I paid.   ATMOSPHERE:  I had actually previously passed by this place, and peeked in quickly before walking away - the exterior looks slightly more dingy and dive-ish than the dark/cramped interior, which is why I'm so surprised at some of this place's high prices. This is no upscale place...  VERDICT:  The mediocre food aside, my gripes with this place have nothing to do with being \"cheap\" or \"Asian,\" as another reviewer (possibly affiliated with Liberty Burgers) somewhat racistly implied. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of integrity in this place's business practices, where many policies and staff miscommunications appear to exist just to deceive and/or price-gouge customers. Nobody wants to feel cheated - I will most definitely NOT be back."}
{"text":"Liberty Burgers & Wings is a cute little burger place on Main Street Markham.   The dark wooden decoration inside the restaurant is chic and comfy with quite a few booth seating. However, on this nice fall like summer afternoon, I decide to enjoy their smallish patio...which as around 6 tables or so overlooking Main Street.  The menu has a great choice of how you like to dress up your burger to make it \"gourmet\". However, as usual I opt for the basic Hamburger ($8.99) but upgraded it with Sweet Potato for an extra $1.  100% Organic Beef maybe good for my body, but for me taste is the most important. The patty was grilled and has a great charcoaled flavour... seasoned well. It is a little dry but acceptable and went well with their signature sauce.  The Sweet Potato Fries was so so so good, one of the best I ever have. But I don't know if they forgot the dipping sauce? Though I don't really need any as it tasted good the way it was!!  Liberty Burgers is A-OK for their burgers, I might have to come back to try their wings over a pint of beer........"}
{"text":"If you want to go to a place that charges you money for WATER, then this is the place for you. I asked for some water and I got charged $1.55 for it. They don't even tell you in advance.  Yes, you may make a little bit of money selling water to your customers but you lose so much more because customers will not come back. Good luck scamming."}
{"text":"Been veggie burger hopping and this place I had their specialty (forgot the name) but it had avocado and twas awesome. Poutine was also awesome!"}
{"text":"It's a small little restaurant which can get quite crowded during dinner rush on weekends. They serve burgers and wings.  Burgers here are pretty good; not the best. Patties tasted home made; came with a side of fries.   I normally get the wings here. Spicy liberty is quite good; home made signature sauce; warning it's medium spicy. Smoked parm (BBQ and parm) is a good choice if you can't handle the heat."}
{"text":"Burger Binge Week review: Smokehouse  Near the middle of Main Street Markham is where this smallish burger and wing joint hails.  My first time here was for Burger Binge Week to try out their Smokehouse burger.  The place is smallish, similar to a mom & pop burger joint with uneven tables.  Presentation wise, the burger comes open where the onions, pickles and lettuce are on one bun and the cooked parts are on the other half.  This is a good strategy as it keeps the uncooked parts crispier and allows us to add more ketchup or other toppings if needed (hint: don't' bother, the mix is already good).  The burger itself was thick and meaty.  The sauce had a little kick to it, though most people probably won't notice.  The amount of toppings is outstanding.  The burger is grilled and had a great aroma.  The meat was a bit dry though, but I don't mind if it blends well with the other toppings and it did.  Considering I don't like onions and pickles normally I also liked the ones they had provided with the burger and it all mixes very well.  Though in all honesty, the regular price of $13.95 is just way too expensive for this considering the venue as well.  At the very least we got to try it out for $5 on Burger Binge Week.  However, I don't think I would visit here normally because for the price.  Though I would recommend people to try it out at least once."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Markham and I can honestly say I've never tasted a better burger in my life...they were so delicious and juicy.  The service was outstanding and the owner was so welcoming and made sure we were taken care of.  This place really cares about the quality of their food.  I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Visited this place a while ago but never got around to reviewing it until now. I actually forgot I had visited, which is never good for any restaurant.   The burger I had was okay at best. Somewhat larger than a regular burger, but not worth the price tag it came with.  I got a sub Caesar salad, also not worth the extra few bucks. Best part of the meal was my beer. Tap water here is non-existent, they would rather charge you $2.50 for a water bottle that probably cost them $0.15  Place is tiny. Literally the size of a walk in closet. Only a few tables, which all wobble. Nothing more annoying then eating and having a beer on a wobbly table. Patio outside also small. Can't do much though, space is limited, just a heads up to those who have never been here.   I wanted to return to try the wings, but my first visit wasn't great, so the chances of me returning to this joint is slim to none.   *also, to the *** of an owner that runs this joint, you're in the business of making food and selling it to people in the hopes of making a profit. Extreme Overcharging on food that anyone can make, not offering tap water, coming on here and trying to justify your HORRIBLE reviews by belittling the only people who actually tried your 1 star restaurant.. is not how you fix things."}
