{"text":"Girasole is a great example of authentic, traditional Italian food.  My boyfriend and I have made this restaurant one of our date-night staples! It is BYOB so feel free to bring your favorite bottle to enjoy with your meal.  They have a rotating seasonal menu that offers daily chicken, fish and meat specials.  Each meal comes with a house salad and a side of bread. 

The restaurant is great at accommodating your dietary needs. I came with my family for my graduation and they were able to accommodate my mom who has Celiac (an allergy to gluten) without any problems!   

I have to admit, if you come here it's definitely for the food. The restaurant is small (which creates a romantic setting) and the tables are very close together (which helps you make friends with your neighbors)! The servers do a great job of tending to their guests and making the best of the situation and the restaurant can feel cramped, loud and chaotic if you are not ready for it.  You are definitely better off making a reservation, but keep in mind that t doesn't always guarantee that your table will be available at that specified time. 

I recommend going to Girasole on your next date night with an open mind and taking the time to enjoy the food and atmosphere, since that is what makes Girasole one of the best restaurants in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time after finding them on the gluten-free app my wife uses due to her celiac. We loved the family Italian restaurant atmosphere as it was loud and lively - very festive.  They are very sensitive to those needing a gluten free menu and Patti and our waitress were very attentive to that need by making good suggestions on the pasta choices.  My wife said it was the best pasta she's had EVER!   She had it with a lobster cream sauce and I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli with tomato cream sauce that was fantastic.  We couldn't have had a better experience. 

8/24- we went again with another person who had celiac and same experience- this place is a gem!   I had the meatball plate this time and it was ridiculous!  Love this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"OVERALL:
Given the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.

SERVICE:
Despite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.

FOOD:
Disappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. 

Fortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.

My steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. 

Desserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.

AMBIANCE: 
Probably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.

FINAL VERDICT:
Probably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had, from the service to the food everything was awful! The restaurant is so small that you're literally bumping elbows with the next table while attempting to eat, it was uncomfortably cold as they sat us at a table right by the door, which was constantly opening as there is no waiting room so we were hit with bursts of cold air every 5 minutes. Not to the mention the noise does not make for a pleasant relaxing ambiance. Our server was extremely snooty and acted put out that we were even there. There were no water glasses on the table and he never offered or even served us water, the bread basket for four people was extremely meager and we asked twice for a second basket which he took a half hour to bring, my friend had no fork in her place setting which it took five 5 minutes after asking the server to bring one while her hot meal sat waiting. The server offered no suggestions on the menu and when finished he simply threw the check on the table without even saying saying thank you. As far as the food, the meatball appetizer was not even great, Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza meatballs and Ricotta's blows Girasoles away, I don't understand why everyone loves this place. Honestly Olive Garden is better HA! We will never go back!"}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful!

I eat here often and never disappointed.

The Linguine Rustic (linguini w/ little neck clams) was the best I've ever eaten!  Their house salad that comes with your entre is absolutely perfect and flavorful (gorgonzola cheese and sunflower seeds are a wonderful touch!).

Bellissimo!"}
{"text":"The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm, just as it stated to get busy.  We submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins.  As tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations.  It was like we were invisible.  As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me, mumbled a sentence with the word \"ridiculous\" and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).

Only reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.

I just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We landed in Pittsburgh about six weeks ago, relocating from the Bay Area and a life of local and organic eats.  Pittsburgh has left a lot to be desired.  However, we have found a reliable and cozy Italian restaurant in Girasole.  

Their menu is simple--pollo, carne, pesce-- but creative and, when the evening's specials aren't just what we want, there's always the gnocchi which comes with a tasty salad, bonus for the vegetarians.  Very impressed with the salmon, great presentation, great flavors.  The service is excellent and the owner is a charmer.  Grazie!"}
{"text":"Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \"Hey!\" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.
Well, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \"list\". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \"out of towners\" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). 

We subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey and pretentious for what it offers.  The menu's kind of short and not always easy on the wallet, especially the daily specials supplement.  The ambiance is neat, but like all other reviewers have said, it gets loud.  I think it contributes to a classy, European feel though.  My boyfriend and I don't talk too much when we eat so the noise wasn't a problem.

I had the spaghettini which has spinach and clams.  It was watery, but didn't water down the taste so it's forgivable.  My boyfriend had the ravioli (I forget what the filling was, but I don't think it was vegetarian).  The sauce with the ravioli -- a vodka-type sauce -- was tasty and great for dipping bread.

Despite NOT ordering the cheapest items on the menu, we were still perceived as cheap college students (maybe we should've dressed up a little?).  The waitress gave us the check immediately after we finished without interesting us in coffee or dessert.  A shame.  We were planning to order tiramisu, but we decided to watch our waists anyway and just paid and left.  Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday night around 6pm and the place was packed. The space is small to begin with so they crammed the 3 of us in at the end of a long row of tables. We were also seated by the grumpy older Italian guy with the glass of wine as also mentioned by another poster. I found him interesting and humourus. Having a close Italian friend growing up being in the restaurant reminded me of dinners at her house with her big extended family. Everyone talks loud but are all laughing and having a great time. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was awesome. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli and the sauce was to die for. My husband and daughter both penne with marinara sauce, one with sausage and one with chicken. They both loved it. We were served by Vito which I believe is the grumpy old guys son. He was attentive and took good care of us considering how busy he was. We loved the whole feel of the restaurant and would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"The best part of this place is definitely the atmosphere and service.  It's always busy, lively and the staff really hustle.  The food to me was just ok though.  Nothing horrible, but nothing that stood out.  

We ordered the Linguine Rustic and the Mezza Rigatoni.  Both were ok, the Linguine seemed a little bland to me and some of the clams seemed like they were from a can? The rigatoni was much better.  The pasta was cooked well and the meat sauce was very flavorful.  I was wishing for red pepper flakes the whole time though, but that's a personal preference really.

Overall, I would probably give it another shot and maybe try the ravioli everyone seems to rave about!  And, of course take advantage of the BYOB next time."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh to take out of town guest to.....and maybe even the best restaurant in Pittsburgh!  My friends from California love, love loved the food and the atmosphere. The food has been consistently good from day one...never had a bad meal. Pasta is great but the SALAD is awesome. Their sausage is delicious too!!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say except that if you have to go here wear a swimsuit because it is so hot inside you might just pass out ! When we asked why it was so hot inside I was told\" because we are in a basement \"  That was a joke. I guess that's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c. I must stress everyone, including the waiters, were drenched. If that weren't bad enough after sitting through a very uncomfortable dinner, the food was just fair.  If there existed a problem with their a/c, I would rather have been told the truth. We won't be going again !  If I were you, I'd think twice about going here to pay for a meal and a bath!"}
{"text":"Girasole has excellent fresh pasta and a good selection of italian food. The staff is great.  The food is amazing.  The one critique I have would be the seating is a bit cramped.  All in all, a culinary delight just off Walnut."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Never had a bad meal  .  Definitely a Pgh staple.  The man who owns it is there all the time and always has been.  I think that's why it is good end stays good.  It's run like an old school good restaurant with incredible food."}
{"text":"One of my favs in pgh. I usually get girasole salad with chicken but they have seasonal specials and it is just an awesome place!

Their salad is simply delicious. Every time I've gone there I hadn't said \"this is average at best\" I think it is always the best."}
{"text":"I get the Girasole Salad nearly every time and it never gets old. Great pasta dishes, too, but their salad is just so good ... The combination of ingredients are divine."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great when I came here with Charles for a date, but less great for a large group. Its basement space just off Walnut in Shadyside is cute when you're looking for a romantic restaurant, but quickly seems overcrowded when you have more than a few tables full. It's especially bad for a large crowd (I brought a party of 12 from my dorm one time, and they really struggled to set up tables for us). A friend has told me he's had issues getting them to honor table reservations, too...

On the bright side, the food is reliably very good, and the prices aren't even very high. There's sometimes live entertainment, which can either be annoying and too loud or fun and festive, depending on your expectations. I love that they have seasonal menus! I'm still thinking about last year's pumpkin ravioli..."}
{"text":"Owned by an alcoholic who is belligerent to customers. We made a reservation and when we arrived my girlfriend and her sister were yelled at by the drunk owner who insisted we sit outside ITS JANUARY and then proceeded to drop glasses off the table during his fumbling attempts to bus it. I dont understand who could possibly give this man their money to be insulted and disrespected. This place should be reported its a stain on the city of pittsburgh we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Very poor management. Very stupid management. They don't know how to do business. They don't help you to find a table. If you know the waitress, you can walk in and sit anywhere you want. And the manager said you guys go fight out side. They are very stupid"}
{"text":"We just ate our way through 12,000 miles of road trip across the US and back. This was, hands down, the best restaurant we tried. Service was exceptional. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. And the food was out of this world fresh and good.

I had a spinach pasta with sweet corn, baby tomatoes, and fresh basil. It's my new favorite pasta in the world, so fresh and savory, with just the right combo of tangy and sweet. 

The house salads were exceptionally fresh and full of good veggies and cheese. My son said his pasta, penne with sausage, was terrific. The bread was great.

There was absolutely nothing to complain about in this dining experience. Even better, it was the kind of meal that made us want to go back to Pittsburgh, just to eat here again.

And it was a great deal -- $44 including tax, tip, and drinks for two people -- for a whole lot of fantastic food."}
{"text":"I am visiting a friend who attends school here in Pittsburgh, and she brought me to Girasole for the first time. It started out great; we had a reservation and were seated and served right away with friendly service.

I ordered the chicken of the day (walnut chicken with butternut squash ravioli). The chicken was very standard, nothing special, but the butternut squash ravioli was absolutely delicious! Sadly, the chicken was the main part of the meal and the ravioli, a side. I got to try some of their tiramisu, and it wasn't the best, but it was still delightful and surprisingly light. 

But afterwards, around rush time, the small restaurant filled up quickly. The servers stopped coming around, it got real loud, and people kept bumping into you. It gets hard to maneuver around to the restroom as well. They finally got around to grabbing us the check, but told our big group to split it amongst ourselves, do the math, and write it all down for them to run. It took forever to get it around to everybody. It would have been much easier if they split it for us ( I know how much of a hassle it is, I have worked at restaurants for years. But we were a group of young adults. If it were me, I would have known everybody would have wanted separate checks and have had it ready ).

Overall, it was an okay experience!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more. I think the food is solid, and the wine list is impeccable. But I sort of lost my appetite when the owners son complained about his baby on the patio in a kidding-I'm not kidding voice. That was, well, odd. 

I would go back for sure even though I thought the staff was sort of cold. It's a pretty spot and worth a third try."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Incredible food, service and atmosphere. If there is ever a wait, it is always worth it. Somehow they manage to combine fine dining with a \"treat you like family\" experience that keeps me coming back for more. Also an excellent wine list. For Italian in the Burg, I won't eat anywhere else! 
Big shout out and thank you to Madi for her amazing service on our last visit!"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with great food. For those that think the kind old man is the owner, you're wrong. He's half in the bag by 9pm, but he's what makes the place special. Know this and you will be fine. Great salad, bread and pasta. I need to try some other things on the menu, but I stick to what I like. They will make what you want if you are nice about it and it's not complicated. It's not off the charts expensive like most restaurants in Pittsburgh. Since it's small it is hard to get a table most nights and it can be loud, but I don't mind."}
{"text":"Went with the boyfriend yesterday for valentines day dinner, which I guess I should've expected would be crazy. We walked inside past about 4 people standing inside the \"heated dormer\" and 2 people shivering outside. We got there about 5:55 and our reservation was at 6. The I assumed owner who was an older Italian man in a suit came over and told us we'd have the next table...so we stayed inside standing ON TOP of the table in the front. A few other people were standing there too. When a few people left the owner came back and sat us but he'd also said hello to another man who said he'd had a 5:45 reservation...I wasn't sure what was going on, but assumed he had it under control. We were led to a table against the wall that was situated behind two other tables. This place is small and they had no problems with CRAMING you in there! I had to turn in a few different directions to take my coat off without hitting someone. The waiter couldn't even stand next to the table because there were only about 6 inches between us and the next table. So he stood behind me and took my order. From speaking to a cousin who went a few Saturday's ago that's normal there...wow...

The wine bottles were mostly upwards of $40, so we opted for 2 glasses for 9.50 each, which was perfect anyways. I got the spinach and ricotta raviolis in a tomato cream sauce!! They were delicious!! I also swapped the salad for the wedding soup, which was awesome too!! Boyfriend got the salad and loved it! I then got the tiramisu, which is my favorite!! I must say it was good, but I wasn't really impressed for an Italian restaurant. The lady fingers were a little dry.

Overall I would go back, but it would have to be at an off time, like a week night or something. I don't like not being able to see my waiter even because he can't fit between the tables. I mean like tighter than the Cheesecake Factory tables but tables in the isle way as well...ridiculous...it also was awful there was no where to stand or any sort of order as to how people were seated."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and waited at the door with a number of other people - some who had a reservation and others who just got there and gave their name for a table. There was no hostess so after waiting for awhile we tracked down a server and told her we had a reservation. She said someone would be with us. Finally, a man came over (I think the owner) and gave an open table to people who didn't have a reservation. He was rude to us and told us we would have to wait, with no indication of how long it would be. I had no desire to stay after such terrible service so we left. What's the point of having a reservation?"}
{"text":"Crowded and noisy. Jimmy Pie and his staff don't help as they yell to each other over the dinners noise. Too much loud cackling. So I suppose some of the dinners are drinking as much as Jimmy whose wine glass is never empty. We had scallops with risotto and spinach ravioli, which were both very good. Bloody Mary was great, according to my expert Bloody Mary imbiber. Food: 4/5, atmosphere 2/5."}
{"text":"The salmon over olive oil soaked bread with asparagus was divine. The lamb meatballs over brown butter pasta was incredible. Escarole with white beans in tomato cream sauce was delicious. The house salad was even great. Very reasonable prices for the amazing quality. Very recomended."}
{"text":"We made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion.  Not only was our table not ready (even an hour after the initial time) but they never called us as promised as they sent us to the bar next door to wait.  I won't be going here again.  Luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Girasole is probably my favorite restaurant in the Walnut St. corridor.  I specifically want to talk about their salad.  I know this charming and cozy Italian restuarnt is not a one trick pony (their various Raviolis being especially exceptional) but their signature Girasole Salad is really something special.  In Italian the word \"Girsole\" means \"Sunflower,\" a flavor that really comes through in this salad.  Not only is the salad sprinkled in sunflowers, the dressing is made of some blend of sunflower oil and vinegar and really makes the salad stand out from its peers.  I have thought this dressing so deliciously tangy and unique, I've bought it from the restaurant in a bottle on more than one occasion.  Served in a generous helping, you can order the salad with chicken or shrimp, which are always tender and succulent.  Red onions and gorgonzola really complete the flavor experience.  Really, it's the number one salad in town."}
{"text":"Never had any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A great neighborhood standby."}
{"text":"Food: very good, seasonal menu with at least 3 vegetarian friendly entrees when I was there (soups weren't veg-friendly), all three entrees we ordered, particularly the gnocchi, were excellent, house dressing is good too

Drinks: full liquor selection and good beer choices too

Atmosphere: we sat outside, and the patio is great, unique arrangement, feels very European

Service: prompt, friendly, overall very good

(+): connected to Creamery upstairs, so if they run out of a specific desert, always great options to bring back to your table

(-): could have used more bread, both in the basket and refilled more often"}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit Girasole for the first time today. In town from Florida to be with family member in hospital close by. We asked our hotel to recommend the best Italian restaurant in the area. We called and asked for a table and were told to come right over. Upon arrival, our table as ready to go. We went for dinner and had the best dinner we could have expected. Had pasta, soup, salad & dessert(speciality). All were exceptional. Can not wait to go again."}
{"text":"In Boston's North End, you're not getting an authentic Italian meal, if there isn't a Vinny, Joey, and Tony hanging out in the back.  So what's Pittsburgh's equivalent?  I've been driving around through the more urban areas thanks to Garmin's preference of ease over safety -- and I drove past a Little Italy sign.  Perfecto!  But it just looked like a shopping mall -- and I didn't see anything Italian, other than someone wearing an MTV's Jersey Shore t-shirt.

Anyways, near me was Girasole -- with takeout.  So this review has nothing to say on service or atmosphere.  The food, however, was really good.   The side salad with the entrees was excellent -- with a lot of extras, such as chickpeas, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, etc.  Most side salads are just dumped from a Costco \"Bag of Salad,\" but this was really nice, and could stand alone as its own entree.

The gnocchi was pretty soft and light -- the ravioli tender and juicy -- and the sauces were excellent.  Again, these were eaten out of a container, on our moving boxes, with no wine (spare your gasp, I know).  I think the prices are a bit on the higher end of the 'burgh, and would've expected a bit more for the price, but overall pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at this place. I've never had a bad meal.

Thanks bob"}
{"text":"My sister and I went out to eat in Shadyside last week and we stopped in Girasole because I heard good things about it.  Since I am a vegetarian, I asked the host if we can see a menu before asking to be seated.  I don't think this was too much to ask but the older gentleman who was the host that evening practically asked me to leave.  He told me that if I wanted to know what they served, just look at the people's food while pointing to the food at a couples table that were sitting right next to us.  He practically put his hand in their food.  I explained that I was vegetarian and just wanted to see the vegetarian options and he shouted that if I'm looking for vegetarian to go next door to the restaurant.  I was appalled!  I turned around and looked at my sister who was just as surprised to hear such rudeness coming from the host of thisrestaurant.  I then turned around and walked out.  I have never been treated so badly as a consumer.  I will never give my money to this restaurant no matter how good the food is.  I will also never recommend this restraurant to any one who asks.  Actually I will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience."}
{"text":"Most restaurants don't even come close to having as much soul as Girasole. They've created such a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere in such a tiny space, and I find that the noisy closeness actually produces more intimate dinner conversation because your fellow diners--although right beside you--are also engaging in conversation at a normal volume. The result is a wonderful din that provides all the privacy you could ask for in a warm little stone room full of delicious smells. 

I've been to Girasole several times over the past couple of years, and they've never disappointed me. I've read the other reviews that talk about bad service and an unpleasant host, but every single server and especially the host have always been such wonderful, real people doing great work. I've had nothing but exceptional service, and the host always seats us well and very quickly even when there doesn't appear to be an empty seat in the place. The host is a lovely fixture and quite a character--just what any authentically Italian American restaurant requires. The staff is very down to earth and not at all pompous about the high-quality, honest food. You feel like a part of their family as soon as you step inside.

I was especially amazed that my friend was able to make a reservation for 9 people on my birthday--9 people is like 1/4 of the restaurant. I cannot believe anyone who says that they don't accommodate reservations. And they took really good care of us, which I know can't be fun or easy on even the best server.

Now, the food! Let's start with the free stuff. The never-ending complimentary bread is perfect. The oil and balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt makes it heaven--just as good if not better than the NOT-complimentary bread served throughout Italy these days. The house salad that comes with every entree is also so divine that I could never even dream of swapping it for one of the soups. It has chickpeas, sunflower seeds, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, plus red onions and gorgonzola which are optional. And I'd give them my first born for the vinaigrette recipe.

The entrees are mostly seasonal with a few favorites that stick around all year--the spinach ricotta raviolis for example. I have several friends who have declared this dish to be their final meal choice without question. I agree that the tomato cream sauce should be illegal. One of the chicken of the day specials was particularly memorable as well--probably the best chicken marsala I've ever had by a long shot. The pastas are always winners--just take your pick.

Finally, their cocktails have got to be the most underrated in the city. The \"Italian Man\" in particular cannot be rivaled in my humble opinion. The bourbon, averno amaro, carpano antica, bitters, and flamed orange peel are in perfect harmony, and I fail every time to recreate his rugged beauty in my own kitchen. If I'd give up my first born for the vinaigrette, I'd sell my soul to be able to make the Italian Man cocktail. 

If you're still not convinced, visit on a Tuesday night when they have a live singer guitarist who is worth sticking around for. Just request anything by Van Morrison--you'll leave very, very happy."}
{"text":"From the other reviews I really had high expectations for this Italian restaurant - was hoping for some authentic Italian food. Not the case. Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade. 

It's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre, the service was very slow and the prices were high."}
{"text":"Girasole is a great Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  The gnocchi is fantastic. They have a pretty broad italian wine list and great deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating."}
{"text":"antipasto and bruschetta were very good but the prices for wine are way too high."}
{"text":"Girasole, is, amazing! I see this restaurant almost everyday on the way to my workout in Shadyside and can't believe I haven't stopped before. First off, we had a reservation for 8, and my friend and I called to see if we could get in early. Pie (the sweet Owner who greets every guest with a hug or a handshake) said he would try and squeeze us in. Upon arrival the restaurant was PACKED but, he did everything he could to make us feel welcome, including opening our bottles of wine before we sat down. 

After waiting for a bit, we were seated at a small table and immediately greeted by a friendly server. The menu seemed to be special each night so we ordered those dishes but, I would recommend looking at the pasta dishes before ordering one of the specialties. I saw these come out and boy did they look good. I will come back here and have already told my friends about how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Girasole is a cute little Italian restaurant in the heart of Shadyside. The service staff is friendly and professional. The owner is typically around and often serves as the maitre d. 

The food here is consistently good. Almost immediately after you sit down, you're welcomed to fresh Italian bread, which you can enjoy with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. 

The menu is literally seasonal (there is one set menu for each of the four seasons of the year) and I haven't observed many changes over the years.

All the main courses come with a simple but delightful salad, which basically consists of garden greens, Gorgonzola cheese, sunflower seeds and a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette. 

The potato gnocchi are excellent and the spinach and ricotta raviolis are also wonderful.

All in all, Girasole is a pretty good restaurant - and the only improvement I can suggest is that their bread would be so much more enjoyable if they warmed their butter so it is spreadable."}
{"text":"My dining experience at Girasole's earned 5 stars for atmosphere, presentation, service and deliciousness. The owner gave us a warm welcome and the food and service truly were exceptional. Based on conversation in the taxi ride back to our hotel, the 5 people I had invited to dinner agreed. We also agreed that everyone was uncomfortable ordering  from a menu with no prices on 3 out of 4 of the main courses, the \"secondi\" selections. The menu states there are 3 market priced items. Inside the menu is a sheet of paper with the current date describing the days meat, chicken and fish specials. Prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either. I find that to be extremely disrespectful, not only to the diner who is paying for dinner but also to the guests. As dinner was my treat, I felt very awkward asking for prices. My waiter (the owner's son) asked the table if we had any questions about the menu. Really? Since the restaurant doesn't print prices I find it extra rude that the waiter doesn't mention them. Note that risotto, the only entree with a price, is $20. The beef turns out to be $35. It's fortunate for the waiter that a 20% gratuity was added to my bill because I wasn't feeling too generous when he delivered it. Putting the price disclosure issue aside however, I would happily rate Girasole 5 stars and I will recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. Haven't had a bad meal yet nor has any of our dinner partners. The pumpkin ravioli with their sage sauce is out of this world and the strip steak is pure perfection. We've eaten here several times and no matter what we order it is perfection. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Our dear friends and I had a night to remember at Girasole. Don't miss the chance to dine at this tucked away gem in Shadyside.

Starting with the cozy but lively ambience and a delightful welcome from Patti, their take on modern Italian cuisine impressed all of us. Our festive table had diverse tastes including carnivores, picky vegetarians, adventurous epicureans and lactose-averse diners but they satisfied us all.  Vito, our charming and efficient server, patiently provided recommendations and the chef accommodated all our needs creatively.

I highly recommend first sampling any of their delicious appetizers with their well-blended cocktails. Be sure to order the antipasto- the Prosciutto was delicate and melted in my mouth. Later, Vito helped us choose perfect wine pairings with our meal.  His service throughout the night was unparalleled. 

We selected entrees from both the seasonal menu as well as items from the daily specials.  All of the entrees were served in generous portions. I had the chance to try many dishes that evening and all of them were exquisite. Cocoa fettuccine, black truffle ravioli and the fish special (Salmon and lobster crepes with Gruyere) were especially tantalizing. 

Special thanks to Patti, who went out of her way to be attentive to our needs. We are already planning our next visit to this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the first Italian restaurant I've visited in Pittsburgh, and I was not disappointed. 

I loved the intimate atmosphere...even though we did get a blast of cold air from the door every time someone came in. We were seated right away and the waitress was very nice and attentive. My friend got the spinach and ricotta ravioli which was delicious! I got the gnocchi, which was cooked perfectly. The chocolate gelato was good, but not the best I've ever had. 

Overall, even though it was more on the pricey side for my budget, I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The food is incredible!! Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm, and having to wait in an awkwardly crowded area, it was totally worth it!! This was my first visit to Girasole. We were a group of 5 celebrating my daughters engagement. Shared a bottiglia di vino.  All of our dinners came with a fresh salad with sunflower seeds and a nice vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese. I ordered the fish, which was salmon. Unbelievable!! It was served over an artichoke purée and was cooked to perfection. Everyone tremendously enjoyed not only the food, but the atmosphere as well. A man was playing acoustic guitar Italian music. I am Italian, and this was the real deal!  I will definitely be going back!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had!

Had a late dinner here on a Saturday night and decided on a whim to try this place and, boy, is this a gem in Shadyside. We split a bottle Buttafuoco Doc wine which was exquisite alongside the Caprese appetizer. The Chicken Marsala entree was absolutely delicious and the Gnocchi was great, too.

Too full to try any of the desserts on that occasion but they looked fantastic. Cannot wait to come back and visit again - some of the best Italian food I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Girasole is 2 doors north of Walnut Street. it is in the basement. The tables are small and close together.  Our food was good.  We were seated promptly at 6pm both times.  It fills up after that.  There are about 5 outdoor tables including 2 on the sidewalk. Prices are moderate.  It is clearly popular with locals.  Girasole has a full bar. Of the 5 restaurants we ate at in our 6 day visit to Pittsburgh, it was the only one we wanted to come back."}
{"text":"Girasole has provided a great spot to meet up for lunch for several years.  I love their signature salad! The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food and drink excellent and so reasonably priced. Table service spectacular. Be prepared to wait for a table, even with a reservation, but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food at very reasonable prices. We went there with our two kids and had an excellent experience. The staff was very friendly and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and phenomenal food everytime.

Gnocchi is great but they also offer gluten-free pasta which is on par with the rest of their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've tried in Pittsburgh! My friends and I ordered bruschetta and aioli mussels for appetizer and both were great! For the main course I got the linguine rustic. I imagined the portion to be small, but it turned out to be a good size. It was delicious as well, no surprise there (: the main course also came with either a salad or chickpea & sausage soup. I got the soup and loved it, but if you're not a fan of tomato-based soups then it might not be for you. 

Overall, I had a great time there. Although the place was a little small and the tables are pretty close to each other, it still felt very cosy and welcoming. Definitely come here if you're looking for good Italian food!"}
{"text":"While the food is incredible, and might even make up for it, the concept of a reservation is completely lost on these people. The past two, or three times I have gone here, I have made a \"reservation\" and then ended up waiting for an hour to get a table. I will probably order take out from this point forward."}
{"text":"Oooooh the lamb shank! My mouth waters just by the thought of it. I have eaten there quite a few times, and their dinner specials are amazing. Usually very reasonably priced under $20 and HUGE portions. Besides, the Girasole salad with chicken is one of my all time favorite salads. IT's also a cozy little place for a friendly dinner. Not one of your romantic restaurants though, because it is small and gets loud. Make reservations ahead."}
{"text":"Looooooooooove Girasole!

The daily selections blow me away on every visit, and the permanent menu has some stellar selections as well. Risotto is always a great choice if you're in doubt. Wine selection is delicious, too!

The decor is warm, with beautiful copper-topped tables and intimate seating. Waiters and \"Mr. Girasole\" are friendly (and offered me a free apertif when I mentioned it was my birthday last year!) but not plying. 

Honestly, I haven't found a better restaurant in Pittsburgh -- although I wouldn't bring a group here. Seating is tight and the prices are on the spendy side."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, friendly and attentive waitstaff, just a bit crammed--you sit very close to the neighboring tables.  Great meals all around, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Completely rude and disrespectful .  The owner treated a minority family in front of us like Alabama in the 50s.  When he finally decided to talk to us and we asked about the reservation we made his simple response was \"I have 45 seats should I kick someone out to seat you!\"  I thought Pittsburgh was progressive but this was as ugly as it gets.  Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Closest to Italian restaurants in Europe that we have yet found in Pittsburgh! We liked the little cozy dining room and the decorations in the room. 

The menu is diverse yet not too huge to be confusing. We tried the salad and soup that came with the entree (love that!). We liked them both. For main course, I had the Italian cheese omelet and my husband got the polenta. I liked my cheese omelet, it came well shaped and the balance of the three cheeses were good, although I would prefer less of the blue cheese. My husband enjoyed his polenta as well (in general I am not a fan of polenta's texture). 

Would definitely return to try pastas and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"LOUD!

When someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. 

Service is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....

Had the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa."}
{"text":"Small little space, the only thing that this restaurant has going for itself is that it's in Shadyside. The salad was the only thing edible, the rest was either frozen or bought from Sysco. Would never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here.  We recently moved to Pittsburgh so we are still trying to figure out the quality places to eat.  Luckily, we found Girasole!  The food was fabulous!  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  There is something about small, rambunctious, Italian restaurants that I love."}
{"text":"Although it's hard to get a seat in this restaurant. The food was refreshing and so delicious!!!!
I always try to go before 5pm between Monday and Thursday to avoid waiting.
If you're a meat lover, I recommend the duck breast, lamb lollipop or steak they serve as carte in the daily menu. It really is one of the best restaurants I know in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Girasole is literally the best kept secret in Pittsburgh. The food tastes as if it came from my own mother's Italian kitchen. I had ordered the gnocchi and to this day, I salivate when I think about it. It was thick, saucy, cheesy, seasoned, and delicious. Their wine list is seasonal and equally as delicious! I had tiramisu for dessert and I am usually not a fan because I cant get over the wet-cake texture of it. Girasole's tiramisu was much more massed and dense. If you're into that, I definitely recommend it. 

The atmosphere is cozy to put it nicely. Unless you're renting the entire place out for the night, I don't suggest going with a group. It has very NYC bistro feel to it. The owners are amazing - I'm probably bias because they remind me of everyone of my Italian cousins and uncles. 

If you can fit it in before this summer flies by even more, try and sit outside and enjoy the weather. You almost forget you're in a city full of sports loving Yinzers and instead are sitting at a side street café in Italia! 

Don't forget to do a limoncello shot!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in the City! Its quality, rich Italian flavors, not fussy, perfection- true Italian!!! The Tuscan stone walls and simple copper table is a perfect spot for an intimate dinner- whether catching up with a close girlfriend or a celebratory anniversary dinner with your sweetheart. I am 30 years old, have been living in Pittsburgh for 8 years and have been there over 2 dozen times. I would highly recommend doing a Saturday night dinner 4-5pm. Its not as busy- sort of like the calm before the storm. And parties of 4 or more, definitely make a reservation. The no nonsense \"old man\" carrying around a glass of wine in his hand- is the bees knees- love him. See you soon, Girasole family!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was last night, 12/4.  Arrived at 6:30, it was very busy.  I was promptly greeted by the owner and we had our table for two in about 15 min.  The vibe and ambience is amazing.  Our waitress was terrific.  She recommended wine and a cocktail for my Wife.  The salads with gorgonzola and sunflower seeds were perfectly dressed and delicious.  The pace was very good and we were not feeling ignored or rushed.  Once again, our waitress provided a real service by honestly answering our menu questions.  We went with her recommendation of Meza Rigatoni and the Risotto.  The ragu for the rigatoni was perfection and the pasta, spot on - el dente.  The risotto was a bowl of passion, skill and delicious ingredients, the best we have tasted.  I was considering walking into the kitchen and hugging people.  My wife and I are travelers and we spend an embarrassing amount of our budget on dining out.  Trust me when I say this place is a must visit.  I have fallen in love and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a date. The food was incredible. He had salad and I had the vegetable soups to start, both tasted so fresh. We both ordered pasta dishes for our main dish- I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli and it was amazing! He had the rigatoni. The food at Girasole is what Italian food should taste like. The overall experience was great too, our server was very good at her job! This will definitely be a favorite date spot!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the atmosphere is my complaint.  I have been going to this restaurant for years but have now made the decision to stop going.  On my last visit, I was stuffed in a corner in the very back.  We were seated right next to the kitchen and also where cocktails are made. 
 The wait staff was bumping into us constantly, spilling drinks on us, and it just didn't make for an enjoyable experience for a rather pricey meal.  Where we sat should not have even been a table. Sadly this is not the first time that I have experienced something like this at Girasole. I am tired of this type of experience at this restaurant, especially after being a customer for many years.  I've found another Italian restaurant in the city with amazing service, great food, and space.  At some point, you just have to say enough is enough. Different leadership might go a really long way. Goodbye, Girasole."}
{"text":"THE SHORT VERSION: You must eat here! The Pumpkin Ravioli was the best thing I've EVER put in my mouth. Homemade spinach ravioli stuffed with pumpkin smothered in brown butter, walnuts and pancetta is to die for. Sweet meets salty goodness! Creamy pumpkin--yum! And this is coming from someone who HATES pumpkin. 

THE LONG VERSION:
First, the regulars know you don't need a reservation. I would call ahead and see what time to come but if you don't want to wait long come before 5 or after 8. I think the guy walking around with a glass of wine is the owner and he could give a shit if you have a reservation. He may even take waiting customers out of order. But it really is worth the wait. 

Second, the atmosphere is tight. Don't bring more than four people. Lots of two topper tables make it for a cozy romantic evening. Just be prepared to knock elbows with the neighboring tables. It was a nice October evening when we came so we were able to eat outside which is much better for those of us who don't like all the coziness and noise :-)

Third, the food!!! From the appetizer of antipasti to the cheesecake dessert --- this was the best experience my mouth has had in a long time. I read the reviews about the house salad but wasn't prepared. This is not your typical spring mix with tomatoes and Italian dressing. Be prepared for Gorgonzola cheese, sunflower seeds, Kalamata olives and more. The only thing they could improved upon, and this is minor, is to have a few olive oil choices and to warm the bread. I had the risotto with smoked mozzarella with hot Italian sausage, peppers and onions. Creamy, smokey flavors were finished off with the heat from the sausage. Super yummy! My husband was the one who ordered the pumpkin goodness! We finished off the dinner with cheesecake and cherries (because they were out of most of their homemade dessert by 9:30 when we ate). The cheesecake was yummy but the drunken cherries on top where a sweet surprise to finish up the dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is by far the best! It is an authentic italian restuarant that is a family run business. If you are looking for a fancy dinner I highly recommend the restaurant. The ravioli is a must have! The waiters/waitresses are kind to everyone. Over all the experience is always a five star!"}
{"text":"Found Girasole on a trip with my daughter to visit Carnegie Mellon U. We loved it so much that when we returned for auditions we absolutely HAD to come back. Mussels in pesto broth were a phenomenal appetizer, and squid ink risotto with perfectly prepared, butter soft scallops was divine. Nice wine list, friendly, attentive service, great food. The restaurant is small. In the summer, tables are added outside to accomodate more diners. I will say that it was quite crowded on a very cold fall day, and there was no area to wait for our reservation, which was about 15-20 minutes late. However, the tremendous dining experience was totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"You have to go into your night at Girasole understanding that reservations may not matter, you could be waiting 20-45 minutes for a table, and you'll probably be sitting at a tiny crammed table right next to another group, but it's all worth it if you appreciate genuine Italian food. 

I had the special, bucatini all'amatriciana, which was fabulous and you could tell the noodles were homemade! Bruschetta, rose, and fresh table bread were all delicious. Only basic thing was the Penne with chicken, nothing special and could be made at home.

Overall one of our favorite easy Italian places in PGH"}
{"text":"My husband, granddaughter and I had a lovely dinner at Girasole last Saturday night.  The food and service were wonderful, and once the owner and his wife found out that we live in Chicago and enjoy watching their son Vince on our local news station were were embraced as family!  I had the NY strip steak and my husband had the salmon with mussel risotto--both were excellent with the steak and salmon cooked to perfection.  Our granddaughter had the linguine with clams--also delicious.  We would be happy to return to Girasole the next time we visit our granddaughter in  Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, good prices.  We will definitely dine here again when we're in town. 

The only issue we had was when patrons waiting to get in would hold the door open and let in the 45° draft of chilly air.  We had to ask three times to get different patrons to close the door.  Management should not have allow diners seated near the front door to suffer like that.  

The tiramisu was unique - and fabulous!

If you don't know the area, make sure to check the location of parking garages because street parking is very difficult to find.  BTW, the copper-topped tables are really cool."}
{"text":"I have been to Girasole numerous times although this is my first review of the place. My most recent visit was on a Saturday night and we did think ahead and make reservations. This definitely helped limit our wait time for a table. On this particularly beautiful Saturday night Girasole was packed. My party of 4 were seated at an outdoor table. The ladies brought a bottle of their favorite vino and were charged a small per person corking fee. My friend and I enjoy all types and styles of beer and weren't sure what to have when the waiter recommended and Italian import call Baladin. This was truly a tasty beer but we both felt like we had been scammed. It was a $28 bottle of beer. I have had some expensive and tasty beers but never for $28. I wish the server would have said that it was a $28 bottle since it was not listed on their menu. The ladies both had pumpkin ravioli which I tried and it was exceptional. I ordered the polenta entree which was like butter in my mouth. Although I did discover a glass shard in the polenta when I was eating it. I brought this to the attention of the Host immediately. They promptly made me a new dish of polenta and didn't charge me for the dish. They were also very apologetic. I would normally give this restaurant a 4 star rating due to the high quality of the food and normally great service. I was just disappointed with the human factors of this dining experience. I would recommend this place to just about anyone especially for lunch. Hopefully my next visit I won't feel like such a sucker...$28  BOTTLE OF BEER!"}
{"text":"Girasole, Italian for sunflower, has been a blooming delight ever since it opened. 

New menu every day with traditional stand by's like the house salad, greens and beans and gnocci. 

Small and often cramped with clamoring patrons, loud because people are actually talking to each other and not on cell phones, yelling because it is a family run business. For those out there who have never been to an Italian Sunday dinner, this is not the place for you. Out of this wold wafting from Chef Jen's kitchen.  

Girasole has charm, family, excellent food and the biggest hearted proprietors in the city.

Along with everyday lunches and dinners I have had a baby shower their, birthday dinners, and funeral lunches. When a family member wad in Shadyside Hospital and could only eat Girasole gnocci with butter and cheese, they always had it ready for a quick pick up. 

When O leave Girasole's, I not only feel like I've eaten one of the best meals of my. , life, but also that I have just had a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Service is bad when you enter. If it is busy expect to be treated poorly. Have a reservation? That will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else. Once seated servers are pleasant and nice,

The food is poor. Verges on disgusting. I had their much-beloved squid ink linguine with lobster. The pasta was mushy--way overcooked. Far too much cream and cheese. Lobster meat suspiciously tasted like it was recently thawed out from a frozen state. Didn't finish this dish.

My wife had a chicken special. Dry. Boring. Bland.

Maybe we just had a bad experience (it was a busy Friday night 8pm). The popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments, but unfortunately not this time."}
{"text":"I am from Pittsburgh, but now live in Detroit and I think about Girasole often as a special place to go when you want some great Italian comfort food, and a loud, bustling atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and you'll often see Mr. Girasole walking back and forth, checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine.  This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside.  You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door, so if you are handicapped or elderly, it may be a tad tough.  It is a little pricey, but for good, Italian like your Mamma makes, it's worth it.  I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad.  I loved the salad dressing--it's light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well.  I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request.  We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance.  Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7:00PM.  Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma's basement kitchen!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal.  Otherwise, Manga! Manga!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to this cave for dinner on Saturday night....the whole family that works at and runs this place is mean, rude and disrespectful! My boyfriend and I ordered mussels which still had sand in them...of course our waiter Vito had to give us lip/an excuse as to why they were like that. I got my meal - linguine with clams - and I took two bites before almost gagging. I told Vito I didn't like it, and he said, laughing, \"Are you serious??\" Then his drunk dad who owns the place came out of nowhere screaming through the restaurant saying, \"Never in the history of this restaurant has someone not liked that!!\" 
Wow....ok...everyone else's meals were pretty good, but to be humiliated while out to dinner was a HORRIBLE experience. 
The food is average, and definitely not worth dealing with these people."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for our annual sibling reunion, coming from Pensacola, Chapel Hill and San Francisco. After the Pirates win in 11 innings, let's try Girasole. Best call of the weekend. Perfect little house salad, ideally dressed. The linguine clams was celestial. Al dente pasta, sweet clams, enough buttery clam sauce to finish off all of the excellent bread. Food: 5 stars. 

A few rain drops on our heads (sitting outside) until the very attentive host moved us over to a cozy table under roof. Great spot to enjoy a world class tiramisu and a scoop of deep dark chocolate gelato. Ambiance: 5 stars. 

Food and ambiance - what else is there? There's Gwen. If you Google \"Waitperson, professional grade\" there'll be a video of this lovely gracious young woman being herself. Warm, welcoming, knowledgable, timely, delightful. She made a splendid meal experience simply perfect. 

To quote the Terminator: We'll be back."}
{"text":"Felt like we were entering an out-of-the way restaurant in Italy when we stepped down into the cozy room.  Stone walls, cheerful decor, but a bit of noise greeted us. Seats around 48, so everyone was a little close to each other.  Didn't matter though because there is enough conversation in the air to keep things private. Menu was varied with enough choices for all food tastes.  The lamb meatball appetizer was a great surprise, as were the mussels.  They were the most tender and flavorful I have ever eaten!  Both will be ordered again.  The cheese tortellini with pancetta and peas was a huge hit, and I was sorry that I opted for the penne and sauce.  Not familiar with Italian wines, but the chardonnay version was delicious.  Saw some people bringing their own wine, which was a surprise. Made reservation, which was necessary for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food: Very good. 

Service: Very good (ask for Ariel!)

Value: Very good. 

Ambience: Nice (but very crowded) - and there is NO room to have a drink & wait for a table. 

Management: Worst ever...took a 7:00 reservation for 3 (on a Sunday) several weeks in advance, then sat us about 7:45 - letting a group that was behind us in line sit 20 minutes sooner, solely because they had one more person (hello? the bill for those 2 Moms + 2 teenagers compared to 3 adults?) 

Special dishonorable mention for Maitre d' (or owner?) who was openly dismissive of/hostile to those in line. He made a point of confronting the unwashed, saying he can't kick people out, which I completely understand and support (not the way he did it, but still).  Given that fact, however, he can't then take a bunch of 7:00 reservations when he clearly has no reasonable expectation of having any tables available at that time. We were one of many groups in line, all with a similar experience. 

I want to stress this is a cool restaurant, with great food. Just not sure it's worth the hassle. Either TAKE the reservation (and, per Seinfeld ... KEEP the reservation) or just go first come/first served."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of the Girasole dining room.  Its a loud, cramped, Shadyside basement with Italian wine, great Italian food.  Sunflower salad is always a great start.  And the oso bucco is to die for.  As well as anything with fresh ricotta.

Also THE BEST catering I've found in Pittsburgh.  The chef will work with your budget and event and everything will fit together perfectly."}
{"text":"Girasole...after 5 years living in San Francisco, we are moving back. Back to where we got engaged. Back to where we had our first date. Back to our weekly date night location as a married, harried, and growing couple. 

Sure, there are tons of hip new restaurants popping up where you can get squid egg foam over crostada and herb gastrique or whatever the cool phrase is in Brooklyn...but this place remains a constant source of amazingly prepared food, in a unique setting. Is it loud sometimes? Sure. So were the restaurants we visited in basements and stone walled spaces in Florence. Is it cramped? Sure, sometimes it is, but it's a small location and the kitchen rains consistently spectacular because they are cooking for a small number. It's not the olive Garden / Lidia's / Bravo where you have an acre between your guest. I'll take perfectly prepared, home made Italian where I have to bump elbows with my neighbor any day over canned gravy and a ton of space. (Last time I was at a smaller table, the group of four next to me included two members of the Penguins...so the proximity was actually kind of fun.)

Jimmy, Patti, Vito and their family have been bringing delicious, authentic food for 20+ years in an area that is becoming increasingly inauthentic and commercialized. Thank you all for being a Shadyside tradition! And see you tomorrow for the risotto. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening with my wife and daughter. Called for reservations but gentleman said they did not take reservations that eve but to come on in, wait time was not too bad. The host actually brought table up from patio for us to have more room by the street, very pleasant. By far and away the service was incredible, best we have had in a long time, I wish I would had our servers name so I could mention it. She was great. Food and wine was super we will be back"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere were excellent. I don't ever post reviews but couldn't believe this place didn't have a higher rating."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while walking around shadyside and loved the look of it and the menu. We asked if they took reservations and they said no but to come back after 9 and we should be ok. We went at 7:30 to try our luck. It was a saturday night. There were a few couples waiting in front of us and we got sat about 45 minutes later at an outdoor table. There was no ryhme or reason for a waiting list and there were clearly people that could make a reservation that showed up so that was confusing. Other than that, the service an food were excellent. The house salad came with Gorgonzola in a very tasty dressing. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our pasta dishes very much. If i lived in the area, i would figure out how to make a reservation and be a regular guest."}
{"text":"First restaurant I ordered takeout from when visiting Pittsburgh to check out apartments. Brought my mom here when she visited - we both love it! Super cute place, and a super sweet older man (maybe the owner?) greeting and seating us. He also greeted me when I picked up my first takeout order here. Food was great, and the service was wonderful! I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli (x2!) which came with a house salad. The vibe inside is that it is a family-owned, home-y restaurant, which reminds me a lot of the Italian restaurants in Boston that I miss. Awesome location on Walnut Street and a place that I'll likely be visiting again soon :)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud, we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back."}
{"text":"My first visit and first meal in Pittsburgh and I absolutely loved it! Jimmy the Pie, the owner and charmer of the restaurant,made us feel right at home. The food was delicious and so was the company in service!"}
{"text":"Our reservation was for 6:15, but did not get seated till 7:05, ridiculous! It then took another 20 minutes to get wine glasses.  The old Italian guy(owner/manager?) who is obviously drunk had a loud verbal argument with a waiter where they threatened and shoved each other right next to our table. This made everyone extremely uncomfortable! Other reviewers used nice words for the atmosphere, but it is extremely cramped and loud, not the intimate atmosphere others claimed. We got our meals at 8:00, it was good but not great. Not worth the price!  The old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress. Besides the uncomfortable environment he created, he really just got in the way as this place is extremely cramped and hard to walk between tables.  So my friends got desert, and I caved and got tiramisu, it was very soggy like it had been frozen, not good.  So be aware they added an automatic 20% gratuity to the check. The problems were not necessarily the waitress's fault, this place is just poorly run.  I can't over state how uncomfortable of environment it was between the cramped seating and the verbal and physical altercations between manager/owner and employees.  Life is too short to waste you time and money on this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has amazing sauces for their pastas and overall a great homemade taste. The main dishes come with a salad or soup to start with and bread. The staff is always friendly and provides excellent service."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant over all.  The staff was friendly and accomodating; the menu had a nice selection.

While the restaurant is nice, I felt that the food was a bit over rated (not five star) and the restaurant way overcrowded.

Even so, my wife and I hope to go back one day."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great valentines dinner at Girasole. The atmosphere and service was welcoming and the food was amazing. The seasonal menu have plenty of variety, with everything sounding so good, it was hard to decide. 

We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner with good company . I really enjoy the mussel appetizer. And. Steak dinner , we and our dinner with Italian expresso"}
{"text":"I was going to dinner with my mother and her friend. My mother's friend insisted on going to this place even though I am on a very restricted diet (basically I can only eat meat, fruits, vegetables, and nuts) so an Italian joint did not seem like a good fit. I didn't want to be a jerk, so I said that I'd look at the menu when we got there and then decide. While I'm trying to quietly figure out if I can even eat at this place, the drunk owner starts yelling across the restaurant, \"You don't sit down now, there won't be a table! What the heck you lookin at?! It's good food!\" My mother's friend yells back, \"She's on a special diet!!!!!!\" Embarrassed beyond all belief, I just wanted to leave, but again, my mom's friend insisted on eating here. They were able to work with me (as the owner's son, our waiter, made sarcastic comments about my requests) and the meal that I special ordered was actually very good, but I still wish that we hadn't given our money to such a trashy owner and his son. I personally would not go back, even though the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Girasole is a trendy little Italian restaurant in Shadyside.  This place has potential to be a good restaurant, but they really need to improve the food quality.  The sauce and chicken was cooked properly, but both needed seasoning.  The rest of our meal was delicious.

The staff was friendly and the service was prompt.  I'll probably come back again if they work on improving the food quality."}
{"text":"...yet another fabulous evening with superb food, fantastic service, and overall enjoyable experience; As always.  the best Italian food in the city."}
{"text":"This may be the most authentic Italian within the city of Pittsburgh. Each dish is made with fresh food and that can be found in the flavor of each bite. The restaurant is small but it gives a cozy ambiance. The best part is the guitarist that plays classic Italian hits throughout the restaurant.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a romantics dinner."}
{"text":"Lovely gem of a restaurant in the heart of Shadyside. From our first telephone conversation to the last crumb on the table, my family's experience was wonderful. The owners went out of their way to show us that they value our patronage. As an out-of-towner making a reservation for a special occasion, I felt that Patti went out of her way to create a memorable dining experience. The food is authentic with a unique Girosole twist! I only wish that we would be in Pittsburgh to explore the menu again. Thank you for making our celebration memorable.

{"text":"Food: the caprese salad (tomato quality left something to be desired) but the quality and quantity of mozzarella made up for that. The gnocchi were tasty but the best was the ravioli - spinach and ricotta in a tomato cream sauce. All the comfort you could want. Tasty cheese cake as well. 

Price was a bit expensive - all told we spent $100 for 2 including drinks and dessert. Definitely a good place to go for a slightly upscale meal without any snootiness. 

Bustling and fun environment - we didn't have to wait for a 2 person table on Saturday night, but larger parties would."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food with an intimate atmosphere. By no means a \"hidden gem\" like some of the other reviews tout, but overall very great flavors"}
{"text":"We had a very very long wait, as we were in a group and the place is small. Not impressive, as we had a reservation. The delay was not handled very graciously. 

Once we were seated, though, I totally understood why our hosts chose this place. This meal was simply divine. All the pastas were fresh and toothsome, the table bread had a perfect crust. Seafood was cooked to perfection. 

But the steak. OH, THE STEAK. This was one of the top three pieces of beef I've ever had the fortune of tasting. It was perfectly and simply prepared, letting the natural flavor shine. 

All in all, we adored our meal, and I wish this restaurant luck and fortune in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.

It was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.
The owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.
Finally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations, walked in after us, but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would \"be taken care of\". I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine, something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that.
We still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to give this place a go considering the reviews, but I figured I would try it anyways. Made a reservation for 7:30 and got seated around 7:50, that really didn't bother me though. It's got a very classic Italian looking cellar-esque vibe going on that I really dig but this place is just too small. You are constantly being bumped into by staff, without apology for your entire dinner. It's almost like bumper karts at an amusement park but you picked the kart that doesn't work and you have to sit there miserably getting slammed by everyone for the duration of your meal. Our waiter had an air about him, and wasn't very polite. No response to please or thank you, just drop off without speaking and on he went. It was all business and he probably didn't care about us because they seemed very under staffed. The bread was good, the wine was good, the salad was fine and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with tomato cream sauce was good but it didn't blow my mind. When I wasn't being slammed into with oil from my salad going all over my sweater it was almost enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little Italian restaurant on a side street in Pittsburgh.  

I started with a bowl of the sausage and chick pea soup. I had never tried this type of soup but I wanted to be adventurous. Boy, was I glad that I did. It consisted pieces of spicy sausage mixed in a tomato based broth with chick peas and spinach (I think). We added some shredded parmigiana cheese on top and wow....

My main course was homemade orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. It was very tasty but not overpowering. 

You will need to review the menu before you go as they do have a limited selection and the menu rotates seasonally.  The place is small and was packed so the service suffered a bit. The owner was walking around greeting patrons. He seems like a nice guy.  

I guess I will finish my review by quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger and saying \"I'll be back\".  I will."}
{"text":"Cozy and comfortable, our food was really good, and the waitstaff friendly and efficient!

The mussels were great (garlic madness) and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen. wowowow.

Will definitely try and revisit next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This quaint, hole in the wall (quite literally, I passed it three times before I found it) rustic Italian treasure is a must try! You walk into Girasole and you will instantly be greeted like family. The ambiance has a warm closeness like you're amongst friends you haven't seen in a long time. The cocktails are done right and the food is fantastic. Great flavors and beautiful presentation on the food."}
{"text":"I love so much about Girasole!! I sat at a table Street side on a beautiful night and enjoyed a fantastic Nebbiolo and the Polpette. Fantastic and authentic dish with layers of flavors. My server was friendly and attentive and the whole experience was warm and welcoming. I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, consistent Italian.  The Girasole salad with sunflower vinaigrette is a tast start to any meal and their pastas are great.  I am especially excited for the summer menu in a few weeks so that I can enjoy the spinach spaghetti with tomatoes, corn, and mozzarella again.  Weekends can get packed and service sometimes is a bit slow during these times, but that won't stop me from giving this gem five stars for the excellent food."}
{"text":"TREATED BADLY. We had a 7:30 reservation for four adults. We arrived and reported in early (5-10 minutes). There was NO organization as far as a list or order and because of that the owner kept seating locals and our party -- as well as another from out of town -- just waited in the street. Tables were finished and bills settled, yet not bussed and cleaned quickly. One such table on the sidewalk was a folding temporary table like those found at Office Depot for $20. The owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us. I understand waiting and being patient, I even understand taking care of your regulars, but to treat \"out of towners\" in this manner is UNACCEPTABLE! By 8:30 or so we just walked off in disgust and found a friendlier atmosphere to dine in and were accepted with open arms. Is the food good at Girasole? WHO KNOWS, we didn't get a chance to sample anything and after the wait, we could care less about the food. Personally, I can't imagine enjoying what might be a nice meal when folks are treated like we were. GET ORGANIZED WITH A SYSTEM OR LIST, COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE WHO ARE WAITING PATIENTLY, DON'T CRAP ON NON-LOCALS, AND DON'T MAKE FOLKS WAIT THAT LONG WHO HAVE A RESERVATION (and if we have to wait, talk to us and share the situation and DON'T seat locals in front of us who arrived much later). Sort through and read the many other reviews and you will see a similar trend in the owner's pathetic seating protocol (or lack thereof)."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a nice place to celebrate our 23rd anniversary. Researched various reviews on Yelp and finally decided to try Girasole. We arrived at around 7:30 on a Saturday evening to find a full restaurant, but our timing was apparently good because we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is small and seating is tight. This is not unusual for Shadyside however and was to be expected. Being a Saturday night there was quite a bit of noise and it was a little hard 2 have a conversation over dinner. On a positive note it was clear that everyone was enjoying their time and the food that we saw being ordered looked terrific.  
The menu is simple consisting of a limited number of rustic pasta dishes as well as daily specials. We ordered an appetizer of beans and greens with homemade sausage which was very popular as everyone else around us also was ordering it. For good reason as it was absolutely delicious. For entrees I ordered Gnocchi, which were light and fluffy and came in a delicious tomato sauce with bits of fresh mozzarella cheese infused through it.  Simple,  but really good,  one of the better pasta dishes I have had in a restaurant in some time.  My wife ordered a filet mignon special.  The steak was cooked to order and was nice and juicy, but a little under seasoned according to my wife. It sat on a base of truffle infused mashed potatoes and was topped with roasted portobello mushrooms. Delicious at $35. Entrees come with a  house Salad,  dressed with a simple Italian dressing.  Fresh and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but personally would probably consider coming back on a weeknight when perhaps it was not so busy."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff.  You can tell this is a family owned business that really cares about the experience of their customers.  The salads are very tasty with a light dressing. I recommend the Cheese ravioli in a blush sauce."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant! I actually am surprised to see the 3.5 stars because every experience I've had here has been top-notch. I called ahead to make sure it was okay to bring a young child at dinner time and was told enthusiastically to definitely come. There are many vegetarian options and they are very tasty. Everyone from the host to the servers are attentive and kind. The ambiance is lovely, and the atmosphere is lively yet cozy. It's one of my favorites in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"Upon walking through the doors, I felt like I was in Italy. Girasole is a very small space, but that made me feel like I was invited to someone's home for dinner. While some might feel congested, I liked the homey feel and the food only further added to that comforting, homey experience. Because the space is so small, I highly recommend making reservations in advance. I've heard reservations aren't always honored here, but I think it's always worth a shot. 

The menu is short and simple and it changes based on the season. I visited Girasole in January and every dish my table ordered was delicious and oh so comforting, perfect for the bitter cold temperature outside that evening. Of the dishes we ordered, the ravioli in tomato cream sauce was the table's favorite. The salad that comes with the meal was also quite nice and far more than just lettuce and dressing. Also, save room for dessert! We ordered tiramisu and panna cotta and both were out of this world!

Girasole is definitely a win in my book for great Italian. I plan to visit once per season to get a taste of each of their menus!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 7:30. Checked in at 7:30 and waited around for 40 minutes. Three tables were sat in front of us. Unfortunately, we left. 

So disappointing!!! Definitely won't go back. Ever."}
{"text":"Ehh.. it was good, but a not great experience in my opinion so yeah: it was \"A-OK\". 

I ordered the LINGUINE RUSTIC ($18), I was drawn to there being littleneck clams in a pasta. As for the wine pairing, I believe I got the PINOT GRIGIO, or whichever was the second choice on their whites that was recommended for the dish I ordered. The linguine rustic was tasty and a huge portion size, but quite salty. The wine pairing was delicious though and complimented it very well. I should have tried the SQUID INK LINGUINE instead, or the GNOCCHI that other yelpers are seemingly raving about.

Anyway, I really liked the decor and feel of Girasole. The price point is pretty high, so expect to spend at least $20 here. Additionally, the noise level of the restaurant was waaay too loud for me that I could hardly have a conversation, I guess that at least says other people like to come here.

I hope I can give Girasole another chance.."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for Italian food. It has an adorably quaint atmosphere, great for dates. The staples ( ravioli, gnocchi, pasta  etc.) are great but the specials are the stars. The features change daily so there's always something new to try."}
{"text":"Girasole is one of the overall best restaurants in Pittsburgh, but it's not perfect. My review is based on an aggregation of numerous different dining experiences at this restaurant, so I feel that it is about as unbiased as a single person's review can be.

The owner is usually on site. He is mostly helpful and professional. He's somewhat impatient.

The food is delicious. Everything from the salad to the entrée to the dessert is well prepared and very tasty. Portions are reasonably sized. I don't think you could be disappointed in this category.

On weeknights, the atmosphere is calm and very pleasant. On Friday and Saturday nights things get crazy. There is often a wait and seating is tight. Don't expect much interaction with your server and stay out of the way.

My only beef with Girasole is one that I see at most good restaurants: poor treatment of young people. As a college student, you get a crappy table and a server who can't be bothered with your existence. In contrast, families and older couples get excellent service.

I would highly recommend Girasole for small family gatherings and special nights. Students may wish to save their money, as may those looking for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"DATE NIGHT! After the Point State Park fountain reopening fiasco, the boyfriend and I headed over to Girasole for our dinner reservation. We walked through the crowded dining room to the table nearest the kitchen. It was just quiet enough there to chat and the service was speedy. Bread and butter were immediately put on the table and as soon as a glass of wine made its way to my hand, I was in a happy place.

The atmosphere is fantastic--tons of happy, chatting groups of people. The food was fantastic. I got the ravioli, which appeared to have been made in house (different sized pieces) and served with a delicious, creamy tomato sauce. YUM. It came with a side salad with some interesting toppings like sunflower seeds. I love little details like that.

Overall, great experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to bring people from out of town.  We love their pasta and I think we have had each item on the menu at this point.  There are NO bad pasta choices.  The environment is very, very cozy warm and inviting.  I feel like I am back in Italy.  The gentleman who walks around checking on tables always compliments my little daughter and the servers are wonderful!!!  The next comment is for hippy/curvy girls that love to eat but then feel bad about it.  My favorite part of Girasole is the poster on the wall of Sophia Loren, in Hydra, Greece filming the movie Boy On A Dolphin in all of her curvy glory in a wet dress.  It makes me feel good while I am eating all of that luscious pasta in cream sauce!"}
{"text":"Love finding these hole in the wall spots in my backyard, I call Pittsburgh. My friend had taken photos for Pittsburgh Magazines Blog, and demanded I go and try it. Let me tell you, Italy has arrived in this place. The owner, was there during our time and they display outside seating, as well as indoors. Their indoor seating is I feel below street level with brick walls, and community art hanging on the wall. Which rumor has it, you can buy. 
As recommended I made a reservation, and was seated immediately. Big up, right there not including the atmosphere, very rustic, very homey Italian to me. We were greeted by our server, and I ordered a water with one of their \"special, owner loves this drink\" my friend ordered another specialty drink. I noticed the prices and strayed away from the appetizers, so I could order my entree and dessert. When our bread arrived I noticed this neat little oil holder, it was shaped like a jug, with a grape mold that held the balsamic vinegar. I WANT that thing. I almost walked away with it, pocket pinched it, but here comes running; in my conscious, knowing that my awful deed would have split all over my purse, knowing my luck. Any-hoo, haven't met a place to go wrong with bread. My drink that I ordered wasn't my kind of drink, there were bitters involved, and my taste buds and bitters don't get along. I told the waitress, and she agreed and said not everybody likes the drink, I'll take it off your bill, and I ordered another, which was amazing. 
As for their menu, they do have specials that coincide with the season. They have to make a bang for their buck, can I please recommend they print that seasonal menu on another kind of paper..other than computer paper?! I was a little bummed out about that. I ordered the cocoa fettuccine, with pistachios, leeks, cauliflower, and Gorgonzola. This is a late post, but I can still taste this pasta. HOUSE MADE pasta, you can't go wrong. This pasta was just amazing. absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering as I type, Now you know this is a good place, if I'm drooling. The love I have for this restaurant is intensified if you have tried their spinach and ricotta ravioli, in this creamy tomato sauce. That you could tell was authentic, or well their own recipe. I seriously can't get enough of this place.
On to dessert, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry gelato. Real chunks of raspberry and white chocolate, it was just an awesome ending to a great meal. This hole in the wall is the place to be."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food.  Very cozy - not a place where you want to have a business dinner, but go if you have some close friends and you don't mind yelling over the table.  The food is fantastic - any of their raviolis will do.  Service is attentive, and their pastas come with soup or a hefty salad.  Reasonable prices, given the quality."}
{"text":"Come for the food and not the atmosphere or service. I Made reservations for 7 pm on a Friday. When we got there was a line out the door. After pushing our way to the front of the crowded entrance to inform the host we were here, we found a crowd of people standing there complaining that they haven't seen the host in 10 minutes. The host finally came to the front and I said we had reservations. He asked who else had reservations for two, which no one did except for me and my girlfriend. Without asking for my name we were seated right next to the host's podium where he had to pull out the table so we could fit to sit down. We were practically sitting on the laps of the couple next to us. The waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations. Aside from the poor service and chaos, the food was pretty good. I had the risotto which was a little bland but the sausage and mussels made up for it. Also, I was surprised by the limited number of seafood options. I will give girasole another chance at a less busy time but was not impressed."}
{"text":"I cannot comprehend how this restaurant could have even one negative review. Easily one of the very best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Absolutely incredible food, great service, amazing atmosphere, and always consistent."}
{"text":"We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.
  
The food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the charming, intimate environment and traditional old school feel of this place. 
The entrees are always great along with the salads that go with it. The food pairs nicely with their wine list or a well made cocktail. 
Be patient if you have to wait, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I have a suggestion based upon the other reviews. It seems as though reservation times are proving to be a problem with several people. I understand that it's difficult for a restaurant to know when its guests will be leaving, then proceed to hold a table (after all, it's a busy Saturday night), which potentially takes time and business away from other patrons. Why not eliminate reservations all together, and switch over to a system such as the NoWait app? That way, patrons can \"get in line\" at their earliest convenience, then walk around Walnut Street until their table is ready. Customers won't be upset that their table isn't ready at a set time, nor will they have to stand around waiting in a massive cluster outside the small doorway. It's just a thought. I love your Italian food, the pasta with the seafood cream sauce is to die for :)"}
{"text":"We love having dinner here! The staff is friendly, mostly family of the owner. And the food is amazing! Also love their wine selection although it can be pricey. It is pretty busy and small inside but worth the wait, or you can go early to avoid the 7 o'clock rush!"}
{"text":"Very very nice small Italian restaurant . Seating is very limited but food and service are wonderful . My only small complaint is the price for a bottle of wine is a little pricey . They should make at least several bottles a bit more reasonable ."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going to Girasole for weeks, and finally went with my boyfriend for a special date. However, upon arriving the owner ignored me for a solid five minutes in trying to give my name for a table. As soon as a regular came in, the owner tried to greet him, but the patron very strongly suggested that the owner take my name first. The owner gruffly took my name and number. We went somewhere else to get a drink because it was going to be a 45-minute wait. The restaurant never called us, so we ended up eating elsewhere. 

Trying not to let the first experience color our opinion of the restaurant we went back a second time with open minds. This time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway. The drink prep table was so close behind me that I couldn't even sit comfortably. (I wish I had reached around and heavily helped myself to the liquor the way the meal went...) The main portion of the restaurant has ambient lighting and a romantic feel. However, our table was cast in the bright glare of the kitchen pass-through window that was basically at the end of our table. The service staff couldn't fit past our table in order to pick up the food. They kept tripping over one another repeatedly and often were yelling so loudly to one another that we couldn't even have a conversation across the table. We then witnessed a fight between the chef and the owner at which point I literally burst out laughing at the absurdity that we were actually seated there. The owner saw me laughing and made some joke about having the best seat in the restaurant and getting to hear the kitchens' comments. Obviously the \"best seat\" part of his comment was sarcastic, but I don't think he has ever sat at our table to realize how horrible it truly is. He thought I was laughing about the chef's comments... absolutely clueless.  

I will absolutely never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. For a restaurant to care that little about its customers to seat them basically within the kitchen says a lot about the owners. It is very clear that getting the highest number of people through the door is more important than their customers. Also to top it off they pretend like your experience has been splendid! They should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table. What a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!  Small, cozy, friendly, and crazy GOOD. Must try escarole and beans!  A true treat!!  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I had a reservation with my family for 6:00pm after being told by someone local that it was a great restaurant. I even called the day before our reservation to confirm and was told we were all set. We arrived 10 minutes before the reservation to people waiting on the sidewalk to be seated with every table filled. The owner was confrontational when told him we had a reservation and said he could not kick people out of their seats. He took our phone number and said he would call us when a table was ready...he never called. Basically, reservations mean nothing here. Even if the food is great, the customer service is terrible. Pittsburgh has a lot of other fantastic restaurants, don't bother with this one."}
{"text":"It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh, but I frequently return to attend events and visit close friends from school and work. I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food, and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids, Shadyside was a hop, skip, and a jump away. Therefore, it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop.

I had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) \"why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?\" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Wednesday night Herschell's workmate Carol prompted us to try a this restaurant for a meal. It was mighty good. All of our dinners were wonderful and nice to look at. The waiters and waitress' were all friendly and pleasant. But what is the thing with Raquel Welch? Her pictures are everywhere."}
{"text":"We called to ask some clarifying questions about reservations and what seasonal menu they were working off of.. first time we called someone \"hello\" .. second time someone answered and hung up, 3rd time someone answered and was rude and made me feel like he didn't have the time of day to talk to me... needless to say we chose another spot to dine and probably will not go here ever."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times (often with members of my very Italian family), and it has never disappointed!! The space is small, but the ambience is authentically Italian--exposed walls, close quarters, etc. The salad is unique with sunflower seeds, chick peas, and fresh greens, but it's delicious. I've had ravioli and a number of other items from their seasonal menus--all great! It's certainly a little pricey, but well worth the splurge. One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"For my 100th review...I'm taking it back home. 

Girasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street. They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it's definitely ideal for a date in the summer. Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive. 

My friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans. The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy, plump fresh tomatoes . We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness. 

We also split the bruschetta, which came styled with ricotta cheese. It was also delicious. 

I picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which were large little pillows of warm goodness. I think there were only 4, but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce. The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish. 

Everything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor. Anytime I'm home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun. Classic Italian food."}
{"text":"Most times, I absolutely love a little place with a lot of character...  unfortunately Girasole manages to provide both but not in a good way.

While the dinning room itself has some great traits (stone walls, coppertop tables, etc.), diners more or less are forced to eat almost on top of one another.  As with most small joints, Girasole has the stereotypical quirky owner that is completely passionate about their business, unfortunately in this case, the owner slugged down 3-4 glasses of wine in what seemed to be an hour...  shouting up the stairs outside at patrons and ushering them around like cattle.

Relative to the food, I was super excited for a seasonal menu.  Going against my biggest desires to get the risotto, I decided on the spring chicken dish (hoping for some lighter fare as well).  Ravioli, chicken breast, sauteed greens and a seasoned broth.  While attractive looking, the ravioli seemed like they came from a frozen bag, the chicken breast was dry and the broth was bland.  While the greens were decent, there were barely enough for a few bites.

Maybe everyone else sees something I don't, because this place seems to be constantly packed."}
{"text":"A very nice small Italian place!  The salads are very good and the gnocchi with mozzarella cheese is wonderful.  A nice light red sauce that is just right.
On Tuesdays they have a singer who walks around .  It's a very nice place to go and gets very crowded since it's a tiny place.    Sitting outside when it's nice out with a glass of wine is the way to go."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.

I often get one of the specials: Carne or Pesce. 
Their salads are amazing. The starter salad that comes with most entrees is great,  and you can get it in a larger format as a chicken salad for lunch. 

I also love the escarole and beans with sausage. 

My wife loves the Gnocchi and the seasonal raviolis. 

Great wines by the glass. 

They'll put you on the list if you call ahead."}
{"text":"Really nice place and amazing food. The pollois juicy and delicious roasted duck?Everything is good except its a little too crowed?"}
{"text":"Girasole is an incredibly cute and cozy restaurant with a beautiful romantic theme.  I've been dying to try Girasole for quite some time and was pleased with the atmosphere.  The food was decent but the taste was not anything to drive me back.  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful with choosing items off of the menu.  She was probably the best part of our experience.  I ordered the Gnocchi and it wasn't bad but it didn't really knock my socks off; I felt like I could have made the same dish at home with store sauce.  We also ordered a Burrata appetizer which was pretty good.  My boyfriend ordered the Linguine with clams and had the same \"average\" experience.  The taste of the food was like something I'd order at a pizza shop, for half the price.

I think it's a good early-stages of dating place because the lights are dim and it gives off a romantic vibe.  The food being a pretty basic taste level would also ensure that each partner is at least satisfied.

I could easily see it being overcrowded because it is a small space.  We went on a Thursday night at 8 and didn't have problems getting a seat.

I tried Girasole and scratched it off my list, but I don't really think I would come back."}
{"text":"I love Girasole for lunch. I always get the Girasole salad. Sometimes I am a little adventurous and do shrimp instead of chicken. Adventurous, I know! The best part about this salad is the gorgonzola. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. The sunflower vinaigrette is nice and lite, and I never leave feeling gross or overly stuffed. Definitely the best salad on Walnut Street.

For dinner, the polenta is nice. Again, it's lite and you can avoid that icky, bloated feeling at the end of a big, Italian meal. The polenta is baked and then topped with a lite red sauce, escarole, mozzarella, and beans. Great combination. The pumpkin ravioli is nice in the fall-love the brown butter and sage.

Girasole ventures away from the traditional, Pittsburgh Italian cuisine. They are all about fresh, bold flavors. It fills up quickly, so go early for dinner or call and ask for a reservation at this sweet, authentic spot perfectly located on Copeland off of Walnut (right across from Starbucks)."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food, great atmosphere and wonderful people. 

I was visiting from out of town and an old friend took me here to catch up. Such a pleasure! After many years the place is still busy, there's a lively vibe and people of all ages who are clearly enjoying themselves. 

The next good sign was the relatively short food and wine menus. We picked a cab from the server's descriptions, and it was perfect. The beans and escarole was a yummy starter, and the ravioli was... well let me say that I'm not easy to please when it comes to Italian food, and especially pasta. But they nailed it. 

Delicious, good sized portions, and the service was friendly and impeccable. We had time to enjoy the food, wine and ambience. 

My only complaint is that their espresso machine wasn't working that night, but I have no doubt it'll be running the next time. 

Oh and towards the end of dinner, from our table on the sidewalk we heard accordion music coming from inside. It looked like a friend of the family had stopped by, the owners and their guests were having a blast. I felt like we were in some forgotten town in Italy!"}
{"text":"Wow awesome local atmosphere and great service if you're ever looking for a quality bite to eat in Shadyside. I got the orecchiette and it was packed with flavor and was a great portion. Followed it up with the chocolate moose cake for dessert and that was just as rich as expected. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my dinner at Girasole last night! I moved to Pittsburgh about two months ago, and Girasole has been my favorite dining experience in the city so far. I had read that reservations are sometimes hard to secure, but my boyfriend and I walked in around 6:30 and were seated immediately by the owner. 

The atmosphere is great - definitely a little loud, but we had no issue hearing each other over the chatter. Really cool copper dining tables and stone walls. The highlight of our meal was the polpette appetizer - meatballs with tomatoes, chick peas, creamy tomato sauce and topped with marscapone. Absolutely delicious and tastes unlike any other Italian dish I've had. We also really enjoyed our entrees (chicken special of the night - stuffed chicken over risotto and brussel sprout hash) and our cocktails. Word to the wise - the \"Stormy Root\" cocktail is delicious but the Jamaica's finest ginger beer is harsh! Only order if you're ready for a strong drink with a real bite.

We will definitely be back - our total was just over $100 for four cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees and our server, Kristen, was wonderful. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I went last year for our anniversary and it was amazing. Truly. Service, food, everything. As it is a couple of days before Christmas Eve and we have found ourselves with no plans, I thought we would dine out somewhere nice. We both have worked in the service industry, so we are aware that not a lot of places are open. 

Anyways, Girasole came to mind because it had left such a good impression on us. I called just to simply see if they were open on Christmas Eve. A man answered the phone and when I asked if they would be open his response was, \"No, we are a very, very holy family. Holy holy family.\" THEN HANGS UP ON ME. Needless to say, we will NEVER dine at Girasole again. So extremely rude. Cannot justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu, the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said, \"Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway\". What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back."}
{"text":"We tried to get a table here tonight and were met with such rude behavior we won't be going back. We asked if they had a table for two and assumed there would be a wait, which was fine. The Owner/host responded by shrugging and showing me a random piece of paper. I told him I didn't know what that meant and he laughed. Apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated. I told him I was just asking how long the wait was and he responded that he was sorry it didn't say it right. My husband and I left and I said we wouldn't be coming back. He shouted out the door at us with a full restaurant and a large wait \"What the hell is wrong with you.\"  I'm generally not one to make a scene and I regularly go to busy places, but I really felt like the response we received here was super rude.  In a city with expanding options it's too bad this establishment can't provide better service, even if they won't be able to seat us."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Girasole for at least three years. Finally got around to it tonight as we were looking for a nice patio dining experience on what is presumably one of the last warm autumn evenings of the year. The patio is somewhat tight, but pleasant -- we were able to get seated within a few minutes. It's on a side street to Walnut, so it's quiet and appears to be non-smoking which is a huge plus.

The entrées (pumpkin ravioli and grilled chicken with gnocchi) were delicious, as were the appetizer salads. They have a decent Italian wine menu, and a selection of mixed drinks too. Overall, we had a good experience, although the servers seemed rushed and this made the experience somewhat less pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent, We went last night to celebrate my parents 40th Anniversary.  Food was great! Our server Rachael did a awesome job.  The restaurant had neat character,it was a bit loud but it is small, so that's expected.  Wonderful all around."}
{"text":"Excellent place with some live music later in the evening.  Everything was wonderful but the music could be a little softer as it was too noisy even though it was good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! This is one of our regular dinner spots for occasions and just a random night out.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. One of the best house salads I ever had with shrimp on top. Great Antipasto. So yummy."}
{"text":"This cozy gem embodies all the things I miss about this part of the US! 

Good Italian wine, fresh soup and breads, delicious calorie Laden Italian dishes, and a quintessential  owner who loves to fraternize with his guests and tell stories comparing women and men to wine. What more do you need in life really? 

Italian wedding soup was my favorite item there. I got the linguine with clams which was pretty fresh and  not lacking in clams to pasta ratio!

Nice place to spend a Saturday afternoon chowing down and drinking Peronis."}
{"text":"I have tried to like his place. The food is average for Italian. The bolognese is flavorful, the duck was good, but the ravioli are watery. If it was just on food alone, I would probably give it a better score. My biggest issue is that the owner is so unprofessional. It is a good old boy's establishment. Every time I've been here, I have seen him move his buddies with no reservations ahead of numerous reservation holders. I know, because last night I was with one of his buddies. We skipped the whole line. It was embarrassing, I thought we had reservations. 

I heard him on two separate occasions try to talk people out of waiting for a table. Rather than saying \"it is a two hour wait\" and letting the patron decide, he was rude and  the comments were \"we don't have time for you.\"  Then, he asked a couple in the middle of their meal to relocate so that he could seat a large party. 

Finally, he yells at his staff. Not just a little snip. Screams at them. This is a tiny restaurant. Everyone can hear. He had assigned a waitress 16 people at once, at multiple tables. She was overwhelmed. He screamed at her for 5 minutes in front of everyone. 

The food is not that good to get away with treating patrons and staff that way. It was uncomfortable to watch. He has single handedly ruined every experience at the restaurant. I don't care if he is the owner, someone needs to teach him how to be respectful and professional. It is an embarrassment. Go to Alla Famiglia. Better Italian, and you won't get screamed at."}
{"text":"Visited twice in one week because the food was so good the first time. Service suffered a little the second visit because they were so busy. The line was long to get a table and it was more first come first serve, reservations don't work so well here when they are busy. I would highly recommend this for the food is amazing and worth it."}
{"text":"If you live in shadyside you should give it a shot. The service is very speedy. The food has a good taste. I recommend you to try the spanish ricotta."}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is as good as it gets!   This is not your run of the mill, saucy, cheesy laden Italian fare.  NO, this is classic and clean.  The ambiance reminded me of a little trattoria in Florence.  Tiny with warm brick walls and air filled with great aroma's that would remind you of being in Nonna's kitchen.

My mother and I were visiting my daughter who is attending college in Pittsburgh.  We arrived from NJ late but wanted a very nice dinner.

I remember Girasole from another time I visited the city but didn't have the opportunity then.  Too bad really, I've been missing out all this time.

When we arrived, the nice lady took our name and said it was going to be a little while for us to be seated.  There was no wait, it was immediate!

It was so busy in the restaurant but the lovely ladies who served us made the time to be extremely pleasant and attentive.  We first ordered the Antipasto, it was great with prosciutto, soppressata, cheeses, grilled artichokes, olives and roasted tomatoes.  Mom and I ordered their Linguine Rustic and my daughter had the Gnocchi.  OMG, I have had linguine in clam sauce before, but NOT like this.  It was homemade pasta with so many clams in a wonderfully light clam sauce/both.  I tasted the Gnocchi and they were like little pillows of air.  We enjoyed our dinner so much that we decided to make reservations for the next night (Good Friday)

On Friday we got there a little earlier than our reservations, but no problem we were seated immediately.  Our first course was the bruschetta with ricotta, mint pesto, buttery pine nuts and grilled artichoke.  It was a great start.  My daughter and I ordered the Mushroom soup, it was so delicious I really wanted to order a container to take with me.  It was full of mushrooms and a hint of white wine and parmesan cheese.  We all ordered the scallops, mom and I had it with the polenta, my daughter does not like polenta and the waitress advised they are accommodating and changed it out for the gnocchi.  Well, this dish did not disappoint at all, buttery, sweet and tender large sea scallops over creamy, cheesy polenta and topped with spicy arugula.  This is a dish that I will definitely be returning for.

The owner was so sweet both nights giving us a plate of home roasted peppers.  Yummm is all I can say!!!

Next time in Pittsburgh this will be my go to place for wonderful Italian food.

Thank you, Girasole for make our weekend memorable.

{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday, and fell in love with the place immediately! I keep going back for special occasions or whenever I want to splurge! Their house salad dressing is the best I've ever had. I would totally pay money for this salad even. 
Their chicken entree with pasta is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Two of us went on Tuesday night around 7:30 and though the very small restaurant was full we were able to get a seat in 10 minutes. Both of our meals, I had bucatini with chicken, mushrooms, onion and artichokes in a white wine cream sauce, she had the spinach and ricotta ravioli (the best ravioli I've ever tasted), were fantastic. Two meals, two salads, and a cup of soup with tip set us back just over $50. I really look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a spot for my coworkers and I to have lunch in Shadyside and came across Girasole. I had never heard anything about it before, but it was close to our office and had decent reviews, so we decided to check it out!

Upon arriving, I realized that I had walked past this charming little place many times without noticing it! It is directly next to Eden, and is right off of Walnut. I LOVED the entire feel of this cozy little place. The sunflower door handles, the stone walls, charming art work and unique bronze colored tables all made me feel like I was stepping into a little corner restaurant in Italy! It is very tiny inside- I felt lucky to be visiting during a non-busy time of 11:30 am and not a Friday night at 7pm. 

Our server was friendly but did not give EXTRAordinary service. I felt as if she was a little rushed with us as she took our orders and did not speak entirely clear. My co-worker had to ask for clarification a couple times when it came to the question, \"Soup or salad?\" because she had asked it so quickly. My other co-worker also wasn't impressed when she reached over one of our plates in order to retrieve another plate. I, on the other hand, am pretty forgiving with minor mistakes and did not take offense to that at all. She was attentive to our table, refilled our waters when needed and cleared the table of our dirty plates as soon as we finished our salads/meals. 

I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli. We had the option of soup or salad with our lunch and I chose the salad. The salad wasn't very large, but consisted of spring greens, thin slices of red onions, pine nuts, chickpeas, one baby tomato, an olive and shredded carrots. I found the vinaigrette to be wonderful- light but packed with flavor. The pine nuts really added a much needed crunch to the salad as well. Our table was also served a small basket of bread. The bread was fresh and fluffy and very good, but nothing spectacular.

The spinach and ricotta ravioli was delicious! The ravioli were rather large and only came with 4 for the lunch portion. It was plenty though! raviolis were filled with spinach and ricotta and were cooked perfectly.The sauce was creamy and packed with delicious flavor. As many other yelpers mentioned, they were heavy on the sauce, which I LOVED. I really enjoyed dipping my bread in the sauce and eating forkfuls of it- very tasty!

Was this the best Italian I ever had? No, but it was very good! I am already thinking of inviting my mom for lunch here sometime in the near future!"}
{"text":"i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews. when we got there, there was a line out the door waiting for tables, absolutely no standing room inside. despite having a reservation, we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes, which wouldn't have been so bad if there was room to stand. there was an extremely annoying/pretentious host walking around holding a glass of wine and doing absolutely nothing helpful while waiters ran around trying to keep up with their tables. when we were seated, the tables were so close together and the room so loud we could barely hear each other.

now, to the food. our waiter was fine, nothing particularly memorable but he was nice and on top of things. the food was also fine but that's as far as i'll go - totally underwhelming, bland. go anywhere else, honestly. i wouldn't go back even if someone else offered to pay."}
{"text":"This little spot nestled near the corner of the Walnut street is a charming Italian restaurant with ambiance and a great wine list."}
{"text":"Tiny, cramped, with tons of charm. The food is exquisite. Even the house salad blew me away. Then the main dish arrived. I had the Ricotta Cavatelli with lamb meatballs, and it was fantastic. I don't remember what everyone in my party had, but no one was disappointed. Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"What a charming little place.  Rigatoni with meat sauce was to die for.  Great salads. Great desserts.  The owner came over to schmooze with us so we felt right at home.  Make a reservation or you will have a long wait (if you get in at all)."}
{"text":"We ordered in from work.  We had a fish, pasta, and salad spread.  The salad was great.  The pasta didn't seem to have much taste to me, but it was also a troff of food so it may have settled to the bottom.  
The fish was the best part of the meal.  It was cooked beautifully and has great taste.  
The customer service was great when we arrived to the store.  We dropped the salad dressing as we were leaving, but the staff were very helpful in cleaning up the disaster and getting us new dressing.  
Overall the visit was good.  I wouldn't give it anything more than a 3, but I also have not dined in yet."}
{"text":"The first facial expression that I saw--a smile--as I walked up to Girasole, a Shadyside neighborhood Italian-inspired place, added promise to a departing customer's words, \"We'll come back.\" 

In Italian, girasole is the word for that showy flower whose dark face twists at the sun and perhaps it was my love for sunflowers or perhaps the comfortable-looking seating that lead me to eat al fresco. At other outside tables, pairs of women lunched, gossiping and flashing diamonds while at other tables, men in shorts lounged with their knees spread. Waitresses hurried between tables. Nearly every customer wore black sunglasses. 

I put on my own sunglasses while the host (and owner?) greeted and seated me, and then collected my order. I've been to Girasole a few times previous and feel that the service is perfunctory if the staff doesn't know the customer, but warm and caring when the customer is a regular. A waitress brought me a basket of crusty Italian bread, followed by Girasole's house salad, a mix of greens topped with blue cheese, chick peas, kalamata olives (with a pleasant bite!), vinaigrette, and trademark sunflower seeds. After the salad, I was served polenta with mozzarella, escarole, and cannellini beans: a peasant dish that balances a light red sauce with bitter-ish escarole, and with rich cannellini and mozzarella. I notice that Girasole gets mixed reviews here on Yelp for quality and portion-size, but each visit I've ordered the polenta and found it well-executed and too much for one meal (I take home the sauce and later serve it over pasta).

When I departed, I said to the host with a smile, \"Thank you. I'll come back.\""}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant. Went with my mother over the summer after just moving to Pittsburgh. She had the ravioli, I had the linguine with clams. Overall the setting is very charming--a small space with sunflower decorations all over. Each entree comes with a sizeable salad, which is nice. Regarding the entrees, the ravioli was awesome. My linguine was nice as well but seemed to have chopped canned clams rather than fresh ones, which was a little strange. Overall I would come back and eat more ravioli!"}
{"text":"Tl;dr - rude and appalling customer service 

I was immediately appalled by the service when my friend and I first entered the restaurant. An older gentleman greeted us, which I assumed was the manager. He asked if we had a reservation, and we didn't. 

He seemed to glance up and down at us, noticing that we either looked like students or weren't well dressed, and shooed us out of the restaurant saying that they were full. We were so confused because we wouldn't have minded waiting, but he didn't even give us the option to put our names down on the waitlist. 

Then, a few minutes later as we were about to turn the block, he came running out the door saying they had one last table for us to eat. Super confusing and rude service, and not sure I would come back again if I'm going to be judged for my appearance before dining here."}
{"text":"Girasole is a fantastic little Italian restaurant. Every visit has been extremely enjoyable.

The service is always fantastic.

The portions are nicely sized.

The salad is fantastic. Nicely portioned with a great vinegar dressing.

The pastas are great. Nice portions with a good amount of sauce. The sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Piitsburgh for Mothers Day and her son chose Girasole. Quaint place and packed for The holiday.  
Pros:  good food, decent service, prices competitive, ambiance nice.  I 
Had the escarole n bean app, very good.  Tortalini dish was good as well. Wife had the occhietti pasta w sausage. Everyone loved their dinners but we passed on dessert. 
Cons:  Good luck making reservations, very disorganized.  Although we had a 6pm res and we sat at 6:15, there was no assurance that we were even that close and had no idea what we might be dealing with. Also, to fit the crowd, patrons were packed in, 3 people at 2 man tables, table of 6 in a 4 man table, etc.  stuff was getting knocked off the table left and right with The lack of room.  I counted at least 3 breakages. 
Would I come back? Only on an 'off' day. 
Oh, one other thing. The wait staff has a habit of yelling to each other across the room. Not good if you're right next to them."}
{"text":"While Girasole serves delicious and authentic italian food, it is not for the faint of heart! The owner here can be very intimidating and if you're here during peak hours like Friday or Saturday night without a reservation? Forget about it.

The owner is the one who seats guests, but from what I observed, he doesn't have a very official seating system. I wasn't very confident that he was truly seating guests without reservations in the order in which they arrived. I understand that certain party sizes will be seated before others, regardless of arrival time, but even still, it didn't seem very legit. They'd benefit greatly from an experienced hostess. We had a reservation and were seated 45 minutes after our time. There was a group of 5 that arrived without a reservation a few minutes after we arrived and they were still waiting for a table after we finished eating and left nearly 2 hours later. God bless their patience!

The restaurant is very small and they cram as many tables and seats into this place as possible, making it very difficult to get around everybody to get to your table and exit. You cant get in and out of this place without at least a half dozen excuse me's. I know that more tables = more money, but they could definitely stand to remove a few tables to improve the comfort of their customers. But maybe this kind of atmosphere is their goal? A loud restaurant with close seating...very family like. Either way, I'm not sure it's for me.

The food here is very good and worth returning for. I had a garlic sauce pasta that was cooked to perfection. My husband had pasta with meat sauce that he said he really enjoyed. My friend and I shared a chocolate cake that was rich, moist and perfectly sweet.

In the summer, this place is likely more tolerable as they have outdoor seating, so I might give it a try again come summer. But as for winter, if you want a place where you can have a conversation, good luck being heard over all the noise. If you like your personal space when dining, this joint is not for you! If those things don't bother you, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian family and being a foodie, I really WANT to love Girasole.  Family owned, lively, and a true Italian menu.  The reason for my 4 star rating is that in my many visits to Girasole, I could rate it a 5 on one visit, and a 3 on the next.

Believe all the reviews about reservations.  Jimmy's friends get seating priority.  He also loses track of who has been waiting longest, so if you take his advice to have a drink next door while you wait, you will be forgotten until you return, and will restart your wait all over again.  

Once you get a table, the experience turns more positive.  The beans and greens appetizer is always perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The Girasole salad could be great, but they often dress it too heavily.

Last night I had the lamb shank and saffron risotto entree and it was delicious.  I have never had pasta here that wasn't perfect as well.

Finally, if you get manage to save room for one of their wonderful desserts, do so, as they are consistently great."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Girasole since it opened.  I love the quaint, cozy atmosphere and the food has been great 99.5% of the time.  A place for a gathering of friends to chat loudly across the table at each other.  I enjoy both lunch and dinner,  but the evening meal's much more fun. 

A seasonal menu offers a variety of traditional dishes, as well as daily specials.  House favorites are the gnocci with mozzarella, polenta with escarole and ravioli are great.  Summertime brings great seafood specials like the seared scallops.  In the fall, definitely try the pumpkin ravioli in a light cream sauce.  

With dinner, a glass of wine and dessert, you can drop about $45 per person.  The atmosphere is a modern dressy casual, with jeans, jackets and cute summer dresses.  The one room establishment is small, making intimate conversation difficult when you're practically sitting on top of the table next to you.  Definitely not recommended for parties over four.   In addition, if anyone in your party has difficulty climbing steps, I would suggest going somewhere else.  You need to climb down about 7-8 steps to get inside.  Street parking is available throughout the area, there is also a parking garage and two metered lots one block away."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place in Pittsburgh. The food here is consistently delicious and the servers are always attentive. Girasole has a seasonal menu, but it also has some staples, such as penne marinara and linguine rustic. In addition to the seasonal menu, it also has daily specials. I most recently had their special pasta, which was linguine with bison bolognese, roasted pepper ricotta, and roasted pine nuts. The linguine was a little on the softer side, but the bison was chewy and created an interesting contrast in texture. The meal also came with bread and salad (which I switched for wedding soup). The bread with olive oil and vinegar was my biggest weakness. The olive oil and vinegar comes in a little cruet and is the cutest thing. The bread was soft and soaks up the olive oil and vinegar very well.
The restaurant can be very crowded, but all in all, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to lunch in Pittsburgh. Their food is so fresh! They have a delicious house salad and homemade dressing. Some of the best pasta fagoli soup in Pittsburgh (it is second to Hoffstats). We always have great service and it's in a prime area! The atmosphere is a little lacking though. Prices are competitive! Cute spot."}
{"text":"Girasole is a tiny, rustic Italian restaurant not unlike many places at which I've dined in Tuscany. The menu is simple, classic Italian cuisine and is recreated seasonally. The ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade. The only issue I have with the place is the owner. He is in charge of seating people and barked at us that there were no tables. We sat outside under the heater and enjoyed our meal there. He definitely put enough of a damper on the vibe of the place that I won't be returning. It simply isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious family run Italian restaurant. Yes, even if you have a reservation you may wait a few minutes to be seated, but the service and food are so fantastic that it more than makes up for the wait. The house salad is the best in town. I love the gnocchi, but if you are looking for a steak the filet mignon and risotto was also delicious."}
{"text":"This quaint little authentic old world Italian, out of the way, Gem of a restaurant in Shadyside on Copeland Street, is by far the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. With  excellent food and service, you can't help but fall in love with this place as I have.

The dishes are prepared with Italian love and care. The service is pleasant and cheerful. The decor and atmosphere invites a guest to stay as long as possible.  Although being a smaller restaurant they do fill up quickly, because of word of mouth popularity, and excellent food, so reservations are highly recommended. The food is well worth the wait on a long waiting list. 

The Gnocchi dish is to die for !!  They offer an excellent small wine list by the bottle. A few by the glass, but the bottle is so well worth it to complement any dish you choose. 

I am on the email newsletter list and keep up to date on all the specials and new menu's.  

Adoro questo ristorante !!"}
{"text":"I'm struggling with this review because the food was just SO good but there were issues that would prevent me from going back.

1.  We were seated 40 minutes past our 8:30pm reservation without any type of apology or real acknowledgement. At one point the host nastily said \"I cant force people out of seats\" when a member of our party went to check on the wait.
2. They randomly offered some of our party wine while we were waiting, the host asked \"red or white?\" and brought out some glasses of house wine while we were waiting on the sidewalk. Then charged us for them. It was such a strange thing to us since he both offered and gave us very little option in what we were offered to add them to our bill at the end of the night.
3. They were also out of tiramisu.  

Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall. Reminds me of the restaurants in Italy! Food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very good. These places are a dime a dozen in NYC, but good Italian is very hard to find here in Pitt. While I think $27 is robbery for a small piece of breaded salmon and won't be going back for that reason, it still was a good meal. We also had the rigatoni, which was excellent. The place is very small and has a casual feel that doesn't match the high price. But when in Shady you can throw some SOS out there and folks will line up to lick the plate, LOL. Still, pretty solid. Just can't come back once you know they charge that much for average salmon. Wine was nice, but very small choice..."}
{"text":"I struggled with a star rating for Girasole.  Overall, I'm a definite fan of the restaurant and will be back for sure.  Here's a couplepointers for people though if you're considering going.  1) Call a day or two ahead and plan on going to dinner a little on the early side 6/6:30 if you want to not wait a while.  The place doesn't take reservations, so you need to get your name on their list for any given night as soon as possible. 2) They maximized their use of their small space. There really didn't feel like a whole lot of breathing room between many of the tables, so if you're going in winter, layer up and maybe not wear your bulkiest winter coat. 

Ok, now for why you're actually reading this review, the food and environment.  Yeah, Girasole was a little loud, but for the space they have (and i'm sure they have more tables out outside in the summer), it's a tucked away gem. It's quaint and cozy for all its crampedness and I give the waitress my girlfriend and i had a pass because of the busyness. We were there for our anniversary dinner. We both got the the soup of the day, the Chicken Pastina soup, which was simple but very comforting and warmed our bones on the cold night. She got the Pumpkin Ravioli, which drew rave reviews from both of us (go with the brown butter sauce) and is a delectable dish my brain is still trying to comprehend.  I got the Linguine Rustic, which was quite good but missed a little final \"kick\" of flavor (i didn't notice the garlic in the dish that much and there seemed to be a bit too much oil on the bottom, like the chef had plated up just a smidge too much of the sauce) which i remedied by adding a little pepper.  It wasn't overly salty, like another review on here has mentioned, but it just didn't have that final \"wow\", and was more of a \"that was a solid pasta dish...i'd get that again\" dish.

Overall 4 out of 5 stars.  It's worth checking out and I'll for sure go back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was Sunday and what do most Italians do on Sunday's? They have Sunday dinner. My mom and I wanted to try out a new Italian restaurant and while a lot of the Italian restaurants are closed on Sunday's, Girasole was opened! It was on my list of restaurants to try and we were not disappointed. 

They opened at 4 and we were the first ones to be seated. It did not take long for the place to fill up because it is pretty small inside. I wouldn't suggest bringing a large party here. Though it may be small, I loved the atmosphere. I loved the stone walls and fancy European paintings on the walls. 

Our waitress was excellent and very accommodating. I ordered the potato gnocchi with mozzarella and a whole lot of sauce and my mom ordered the ricotta cavatelli with brown sauce and pine nuts. Instead of the lamb meatballs she substituted it with shrimp. We each got salads that were very delicious and a pretty decent size. Some of the toppings included, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato and mozzarella to name a few. The bread they brought out was also very fresh!

We were in and out very fast, the service was prompt and we like that! Keep in mind parking is going to be tricky and you may have to walk to get here but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"THIS was in reply to comment left by restaurant, which was subsequently deleted.  The owner asked why I didn't complain about the oxidized greasy mess of potatoes.  Here is my reply.  (My original review is below. Read it before ordering
Here).  

No I did not bring up potatoes with waitress as she recommended them. When food is as \"off\" as it was at your restaurant, I make the assumption that if this food is served and offered as high quality, we are not on the same page regarding freshness and quality, and a critique would not be understood and considered rude.  The potatoes were not \"made to order\" as you know.  A square was cut from a pan that was stored in  your frig overnight. Even if freshly made (they were not) the dish was dry and flavorless.  Made worse by reheating.

The steak was more or less cooked to order - it was med rare - but it was not high quality and was flavorless.  I didnt think it appropriate to get into a discussion (in a restaurant where one really cannot hear fellow diners anyway) about the rightful expectation that a $36 steak would be better than what i might \"fry\" at home from the corner market. Actually, it wasnt even that good."}
{"text":"Attentive quality service and high-quality tasty food. Hidden in a hole in the ground on a Shadyside side street - we only found it by accident - the atmosphere of this hole in the wall/ground is sort of like a stone grotto. We had a delicious green salad, a perfect chicken Marsala, and also a spicy homemade sausage with cheese, peppers and onions. If you're a celiac, they offer gluten free pasta as an alternative for all their pasta dishes. Cozy atmosphere. Great find."}
{"text":"Went to Shadyside to try Salud Juicery but I found this cute little restaurant before I went in. So, my mom and I decided to eat here. I got the penne marinara with chicken. I LOVED IT! The chicken was not grilled, which I usually preferred but other than that it was awesome. Our waitstress was running around like a mad women and didn't really have time for us. We tried to tell her about how we loved it here but she just kind of rudely walked away. However, it was so good, we definitely will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a disgusting drunk old man. I am a young woman and I've been here twice, he harassed me both times, once even sitting down at my dinner table (without asking) to look at me in the most disgusting way and insert unwanted commentary. Food is good enough, but please for the love of god, stay away from this horrible business!"}
{"text":"Pretty little gem off Walnut!
Easily missed while driving by, and it's not even at street level.. that's how little it is!
Seems to get busy and loud during lunch, and the space is pretty limited, so I'd advise making a reservation.

The  ravioli were quite delicious, and their sauces have very distinctive flavours. 
Ingredients were fresh, and everything tasted homemade like a good ol trattoria.
Service was friendly and very efficient even during rush hour.
Definitely recommending it, and would love to come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My mom and I entered Girasole's, dimly lit basement setting on a bustling Saturday evening. Immediately, we loved the rustic, Italian-family warmth of the restaurant. We lucked out when the wineglass-toting host was able to seat us within a few minutes of entering.

My Italian wedding soup was delicious, but I was a little underwhelmed by my entrée. My fish was a little tough, the arugula pesto was a bit too salty for my taste, and the lobster risotto was a little bland. I may have just ordered the wrong dish.

Aside from my lackluster entrée, the accommodating service, hearty soup, and and alluring atmosphere still make this restaurant an excellent choice for a cool evening out in Shadyside.

I will be returning to Girasole and hope that I'll have an entrée that will inspire me to bump up my rating!"}
{"text":"Local family-owned restaurant. It's cozy and offers a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Delicious! On these cold winter nights, nothing's better than warm pasta and excellent wine, and Girasole offers both.  As many have mentioned before, the restaurant is really small (think twice about coming without a reserve on a weekend!).  The tables are closely packed, and much like communal seating, you'll become quickly aquainted with your neighboring diners :) That being said, the intimate ambience also gives it a romantic vibe, and while you enjoy the deliciousness that will be served to you, you will soon forget about the close quarters.  We tried the pumpkin ravioli (creamy, semi sweet and salty with a hint of sage) and the polenta (baked with escarole and mozzarella), and paired it with the San Calisto Montepulciano.  I am absolutely in love with the vinaigrette that sits atop their house salad- question for the owners, do you bottle and sell the dressing?! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"A great place for a romantic dinner... Street parking close by... It was a little difficult to find, but I'm so glad we did... I wasn't aware that it was downstairs... We were seated right away... Got menus and drinks quickly... The menu was short & precise & included a daily special... Our meals were all fabulous... The bean & sausage soup was so flavorful... I ordered the penne pasta with sausage & I've never had a better Italian meal... My family ordered the Lobster Ravioli, Gnocchi, and and the Chicken pasta & they all said how fab"}
{"text":"Came here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It's very crowded, but the friendly service and mood lighting made it feel quite cozy. Call ahead and put yourself on the priority seating list, if possible! While many people waited in the foyer, we were seated immediately. For reference, it was 6:30pm on a Friday.

There are plenty of vegetarian options, and I settled on the risotto, which is cauliflower-themed this time of year.  Loved it! The texture of the rice was perfect, with mellow-sweet cauliflower and toasted pine nuts. There was a balsamic reduction on top that took it to the next level for me - it's rare to find a meatless risotto that achieves such complexity. The salad and bread that come with every meal were also good.

Instead of wine, we had cocktails - I went with the Nerina as I was feeling adventurous. A high-level craft cocktail worth its price, especially if you like bitter flavors.

Will definitely return for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight, got the gnocchi, amazing. Wedding soup was on point, probably the best I've had in the city."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! My favorite place I ate at during my Pittsburgh visit this weekend. Romantic setting, friendly, knowledgeable and quick service, amazing food. What more can you ask for? Be prepared to spend some money if you come here but you really are paying for an experience. Bread, soup/salad, entree, dessert, wine, you must try it all! 

Note: they don't have very many entree options which is the mark of a good restaurant in my opinion. How can one be good at 20 options? This place keeps it simple and does everything to perfection!"}
{"text":"This was a very good Italian restaurant. Very good food at reasonable prices, good service and nice atmosphere. This was a planned visit as we are not from Pittsburgh. Found though yelp and not disappointed. Small place so I suggest a reservation. Also street parking."}
{"text":"Tiny Italian place in Shadyside, Girasole has a tiny menu with a few notable items. Girasole is worth it when one craves Italian fare with minimal fuss."}
{"text":"MY LINGUINI RUSTICA WAS AWEFUL..  Wish I would have said something before I forced the heart attack salt block down...  That being said everything else was fantastic.  Tryed some other things people at my table had and it was wonderful.  Really though someone had to have messed up my dish.  The clams were awesome but someone had to have spilt the salt in my food and still let it go out?  Deserts were nothing less than stellar,  and the service was awesome.  Will I go back yes, just hope it's not so freeking salty next time and I can change my review to 3 stars"}
{"text":"We ordered ravioli and aglio e olio with soup and salad. It was the best ravioli in Pittsburgh. You can meet a gentle owner, who is in the painting, too. All waitress were kind."}
{"text":"Amazing food but even with a reservation don't expect to be seated right away."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!"}
{"text":"Friend hyped this Italian restaurant so we had high expectations. First of all, there is a ridiculously long line if you don't have a reservation. The atmosphere was okay and the restaurant was very crowded and cramped. It is byob but there is a $7 corkage fee per person (quite hefty). I got the linguine rustic and I can not recommend it. However, my friends' food looked a lot better but my dish was watery and bland tasting. Not only was the dish unappealing but the prices are definitely on the more expensive end."}
{"text":"The food was decently made and the environment was welcoming. We came here for brunch. The Italian omelette was good, but nothing special and not worth the $10. My friend ordered the linguini rustic, and he was disappointed because it was not what the waitress described. She said it was salty but the pasta was bland. The spinach and ricotta ravioli was very good though, and the sauce was flavorful. Each entree came with a soup or salad which were very good. The sausage and mushroom soup was very rich and delicious. 

However, our waitress did not warn us about the cork charge. We knew it was BYOB so my friends and I brought a bottle of wine to brunch. She took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything. Online, another reviewer said it was a $7 cork charge which I though was very reasonable. Because of this, I did not ask the waitress what the cork charge was.

However, I learned it was a $7 PER PERSON cork charge when I received the bill, which I think is ridiculous. Most restaurants charge per bottle, not per person. So if I came by myself, it would be a $7 cork charge. I came with 3 friends so the cork charge was $28! If you come with a party of 10, it will be a $70 cork charge!!!

I may or may not come back. If I do, I definitely won't bring any type of alcohol."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dunch (is that a thing?) before heading out to a show at the First Niagara Pavilion on Sat.  Given that we arrived shortly after 4pm, I doubted this place would be busy--and it wasn't--which worked out perfectly, in light of this place's size and popularity during normal dinner hours on the weekend.

Based on the recommendation of my labmate and other Yelpers, I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and it didn't disappoint.  The pasta was perfectly tender without being mushy, and the filling was savory and delicious.  As Rachel C. pointed out in her review, this place is quite generous with the sauce, which is great because this was the best part of the dish!  It was a tomato cream sauce that was delicious in its own right, but that complemented the savoriness of the ravioli fillings well.  After finishing my raviolis, I asked for some more bread and used it to sop up the remainder of the sauce.  My dish also came with the Girasole salad--a tossed salad dressed with sunflower seeds (how cute, in light of the meaning of the restaurant's name!)--that served as a great appetizer to the meal.  About the only part of my meal that wasn't noteworthy was the bread, which was fine, but just your standard Italian bread.

Since he wasn't as hungry as me, my dining companion ordered the bruschetta, which also came with a salad.  It wasn't your standard bruschetta, however--it consisted of what looked like chopped squash with prosciutto on toasted flatbread.  I'm not sure how much he enjoyed it, since he left a fair amount of the squash and prosciutto on his plate.  However, I wouldn't count this as a strike against the dish or the restaurant, since he can be a pretty picky eater.  I didn't taste the bruschetta in its entirety, so I can't pass my own judgment on it, unfortunately.

As others have mentioned, the dining area is definitely small and intimate, and the tables are quite close to one another.  However, this wasn't a problem for us since the restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we were dining, due to being there on an off hour.  We really liked the ambience, which I'd describe as rustic but classy, and it didn't feel like basement dining even though it was.  The waitstaff all seemed quite jovial with one another, which was fun to observe.  I have no complaints about the service we received.

Overall, we had a nice experience here, and would definitely return.  Given the popularity of this place, if you want to avoid some of the problems mentioned in other reviews due to the small space, I'd recommend going for lunch or during an off time.  This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at thus far in PGH, so if you're in the mood for this type of food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"We went to Giresole the first time from a friend recommendation.  We were told to wait outside and don't go anywhere far.  After a few long train of people keep going in a ask for table we were curious if this man can remember which customer cone first.  We were surprised to see that get them all right even though we saw him drink periodically while seating people.  Food were great, love the red sauce, we ordered penne with shrimp, linguine with clam sauce, veal meatballs for appetizer.  We loved everything mostly, the linguine was bit too salty for my liking, but it was good because the pasta was fresh."}
{"text":"For starters, the place is charming.  Something about little restaurants that are a few steps below street level. Ambience was good.  I was promptly met by the owner who immediately stopped what he was doing to seat me, which was nice because the place was crowded.  No problem.  I was happy.

I ordered the fish of the day, which was walleye on a portion of tomato risotto with greens.  The fish was super fresh and delicious; the risotto was nicely prepared and also delicious.  But the greens were bitter and overpowered the whole thing.  If it weren't for that, I would have given Girasole four or possibly five stars.  It kinda ruined the experience.

With two chiantis and tip, the bill came out to $54.

Having said all of that, I'm going to give it another try.  The gnocchi looked interesting as did several of the other pastas.  Maybe next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I went with my boyfriend for a birthday dinner late November. It was a cold Sunday night and Girasole looked too busy to seat us; yet, we were seated instantly. I indulged in a glass of white wine - pinot - which was divine. For dinner, I ordered Ravioli. Truly one of the greatest dishes I? have and will have ever eaten. 

Of course, we ordered dessert. We got a tiramisu. Though smaller than expected for the price, it was absolutely amazing. I would eat here every day if I could. 

Great wait staff, amazing kitchen. The only? problem for me was who I presume to be the owner walking around so much I began to feel slightly nervous."}
{"text":"After visiting Girasole on several occasions it becomes immediately clear that these guys think their shit don't stink....when in fact their shit DOES stink, badly. Now, this is not to say the food is inedible...actually some of the appetizers (I.e. the escarole) is quite nice. Unfortunately, the party stops there. The main courses are EXTREMELY overpriced (not unusual for Walnut St.). But if you're gonna charge $15 for penne with marinara sauce at least make it \"to order\". The owner has a glass of wine welded to his hand at all times...hardly the sign of a serious restauranteur. These guys are benefiting hugely from their location and the fact that Shadyside is home to A LOT of rich people who care as much (if not more) about ambience and less about taste."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a large party at 7:30 on a Friday night. Showed up on time and was told our table wasn't ready. It's a tiny place and seating in the winter is limited so we understood. We went to a nearby bar to grab drinks while waiting for our reservation.  After 45 past our reservation, we hadn't heard anything from Girasole sp called to inquire.  The owner yelled at us for calling and said they are a tiny restaurant and would let US know when THEY were ready for us. Very off putting. 

We finally got seated around 1.5 hours past our original reservation time.  

The place was tiny but the service was great (only reason for the 3 star rating). Might be a better place for a smaller party but it was a mistake trying to book for a group larger than 4.

Food was good, but not the best Italian I've ever had. Large portions and a great wine selection. Price per person in our large party for an entre, glass of wine and gratuity came to $40."}
{"text":"i've been to this restaurant dozens of times and each time the food is excellent but the owner/host has an arrogance to him that unfortuanately takes away from what could be an amazing restaurant. there is always a long wait on weekends and if he agrees to add your name to his \"list\" to be called when a table opens up, you may want to have a back up plan or simply stand outside and stare at him until he seats you. it appears there is no rhyme or reason to his seating strategy. the restaurant itself is small and loud but cozy. the waiters/waitresses are always excellent."}
{"text":"Girasole is one of the places in Pittsburgh I always go to when I have visitors from out of town. The quaint, semi-hidden spot right off of Walnut Street accompanied by its warm and inviting atmosphere make it an excellent people pleaser. The menu is fairly small and changes seasonally to assure fresh and delicious ingredients. The wine list is extensive and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli is usually featured and always delicious. Another plus is that it's open for lunch as well and offers a slightly cheaper selection. Regardless, though, it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food and experience. The only downside is that the venue itself is tiny and it would definitely be difficult to accommodate a larger party. 

One of my favorite things about Girasole is that the owner is also often the host! He has such a bold personality and really makes the whole atmosphere more homey and authentic feeling. To add to this mood, there is often live music in the restaurant--usually just a single violin or guitar player. My favorite experience at Girasole was one late summer night when it was beginning to cool down and I took some friends of mine from Cleveland to have dinner there. I knew they would enjoy Girasole but the wait was long so we wound up sitting outside on the patio even though it was a little cold. A man with a guitar went around the restaurant singing beautiful songs to each table and eventually made it outside. Since we were the only table outside we took our request and sang the best rendition of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" I've ever heard! 

Girasole is a wonderful treat amongst Pittsburgh's restaurant scene and never fails to deliver a delicious meal and a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"After seeing a few bad reviews on other blogs I felt compelled to write a review of my own. I've eaten here numerous times and always had a wonderful experience. The food is amazing, the atmosphere fantastic and the waitstaff, attentive. It feels like you are eating dinner in a wine cellar-super cozy. A great place for a date!

To the negative reviewers: If you have a problem waiting then don't go to a tiny restaraunt on a Friday or Saturday night and expect to get seated immediately. Or have some patience.

My recommendation: call and make a reservation for a little earlier than you would prefer to eat. Go check in, the owner (a very charasmatic little italian Pittsburgher) will take your number and then go across the street to Alto and have a drink or two and relax. I highly recommend eating here- the specials are always great and the sunflower seed dressing is to die for."}
{"text":"Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"We came here recently for lunch for a birthday. Because of the reviews saying how small it was, we opted to go at 2PM to miss the lunch crowd. (We were one of the only tables) 

We started off with some wine that our waitress suggested. She was attentive but not overwhelming throughout the entire meal. We all started with soup or salads that came with the meals and were both delicious. Then for the main dish, while it wasn't a huge menu, it was a hard decision. I ended up with the Linguine Rustic and couldn't get enough! It was so fresh and enjoyable. Everyone seemed to love what they got so you can't go wrong here.  

We finished with a slice of cheesecake and lemon cake and what a way to finish. They were both heavenly! This place is a great atmosphere and even better food! We will be back in the near future but it is small so we will probably come at an off time again."}
{"text":"This place has been on my want-to-go-there list for nearly as long as its been open.  I've since moved away from Shadyside, making it more and more unlikely that I'd ever go.  I was meeting a friend for dinner in the area last week - dinner location was up to me, and, when searching restaurants in the area on Yelp, Girasole popped up and I thought \"ah, here's my chance!\"  

I called ahead for reservations - that was probably a smart move - it was pretty busy.  Dinner was AMAZING.  My friend got the spinach ricotta ravioli and I got the linguine rustic.  The starting salads were really good - the toppings added a great flavor to the greenery and the dressing was nice.  But my dinner - I was blown away by my dinner.  This was probably the best clam-sauce pasta dish I have ever had.  My mother used to make pasta with clam sauce when I was younger, so generally, if a restaurant has it available, I get it.  Most places, however, don't usually do a dish like this.  I now live in the North Hills, but honestly, I would totally consider driving down into Shadyside just to get this again.  

My friend also said she loved her ravioli.  She said she doesn't normally go meat-less but she was very pleased with her selection.  

I'm so glad I finally made it to Girasole, and now am kind of sad I didn't make it a higher priority.  I'll definitely be returning, hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Visiting a university and happened on this gen! Enjoyed an off season bruschetta, I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli which were fab.  Great service.  Enjoyed a Nebbiolo with dinner.  And there was live music! So fun. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great italian food! Warm and wonderful ambiance , super friendly service. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Lovely little spot tucked away in shadyside. Not a lot of room to move around in there, but very nice, simple, and quaint. Great wine list & cocktails and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's right off of Walnut and very tiny, and usually packed.  They have a decent wine selection and the food is excellent.  I recently had the house salad and the Spinach Ricotta Ravioli (Yum!).  Everything was excellent and couldn't be more satisfied.  Service was quick, even though the place was jammed.  Don't expect any privacy in this place as they can really pack the people into the limited space.  The owner is a very personable older Italian-American gentleman, that is always walking around, sometimes with a glass of wine, which to me, just completes the ambience of this place.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why someone posted its BYOB.   We've always had wine here and there are other drinks posted on their website.   I have never had a bad meal here.   My favorite right now is the meatballs with brown butter pasta.   But I have not tried the spinach and ricotta ravioli which seems to get rave reviews.  Next time!   I love their salads.   If you want plain lettuce with ranch dressing, go to Eat N Park.   Yes it's in a basement but it's cozy and I like it.   On Tuesdays they have a guitarist singing and taking requests.   We enjoyed him.  Our party also ordered desserts, but I can't recall what we had.   They were very good.  The closeness of the tables doesn't bother me.    I go here for the food.   If I want romance or privacy, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Greatest restaurant!! Wonderful meals and you cannot beat the atmosphere!! Prices match the quality of food!! Service is amazing as well! Call ahead for reservations on weekends! They're busy on weekends"}
{"text":"The food was stunning. My two recs: spinach and ricotta ravioli and sausage risotto. The texture of the ravioli shell was perfect - slightly al dente and thick, perfectly complimenting the fragrant tomato cream sauce. And I had just tried making a batch of my own risotto and failed (it was much too soft), so I could appreciate the precise crunchy-to-creamy ratio of Girasole's risotto. It tasted even better as leftovers the next day. And staying true to their name (girasole means sunflower in Italian), their fresh salad was served with crisp roasted sunflower seeds.

So why the three-star rating? You know the feeling of gazing into a cozy home on a cold night, with your nose pressed against the window, longing to come inside and rest by the hearth? That's how I felt the entire time I was eating here. The restaurant's interior is enchanting - warmly lit with charming artistic details. I was so excited to experience that atmosphere, but no - we weren't allowed to. Even though we had made an 8 PM reservation, they seated customers without reservations inside, and put us at a ramshackle table beneath a flight of stairs outdoors. There were not even enough chairs for all three of us at that table. I had to grab a chair for myself, and just as I was getting comfortable in my seat, one of the waiters rudely told me to move. In fact, it seemed like my chair was always in some waiter or customer's way; I had to keep moving it throughout dinner. The table was extremely unstable, and our waitress had to put something under one of the legs so that our food and candle would not fall off. I'm not even sure what she used because it was so dark. Next time, I'm ordering take out from this place - love the food, but I'd skip the makeshift service and overcrowded environment in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Talk about a great pairing! Just had th E Spaghetti alla GRicia which was prepared by Gino who is th E chef's(Jennifer) husband
It was outrageously delicious!!! Flavors of garlic,onion and pancetta with virgin olive oil tossed in spaghetti created one of my favorite dishes.Girasole's is consistently fabulous.It is a family (Girasole) restaurant with both Gino and Jennifer as excellent chefs!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a dining partner.   Having read many of the reviews on this site we went early on a Tuesday evening and were seated in one of only two empty tables.  We had thought about getting reservations but the hours that came with my gift card said No Reservations.  The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They had copper tables in a cramped type of environment that is very European.

We decided to forgo appetizers this day and instead got drinks.  I had something that resembled a manhattan while my dining partner had the Bellini and both were good.  Since my dining partner and I both ordered entrees we were served with a dinner salad.  It was one of the nicer salads that I have had with Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds and chick peas amongst the greens and a nice vinaigrette paired with it.  For dinner I had the pumpkin ravioli while my dining partner had the porcini gnocchi.  The pumpkin ravioli was absolutely delicious although only receiving 5 for the price that was paid was a bit disappointing.  The gnocchi was much more substantial though and just as tasty.  For dessert we had the lemon cake which was fantastic and came with fresh raspberries and blackberries as a garnish.  When all was said and done it was by far some of the best food that I have tasted recently and all of my concerns from previous posts were undone with the service being great and having no wait for our table.

The bottom line for me is that this restaurant had wonderful food and not too high of a price point and I will definitely be back.  I would recommend that you go early on a weekday though as the seating is very limited."}
{"text":"Made a last minute reservation for 11 on Tuesday, 12/20. I was so happy they were able to accommodate us. Our entire group had a fantastic time. We ordered a variety of apps to share and brought a few bottles of wine to share. The BYOB was $7, a little steep -- especially since we also had people drinking single bottles of beer. Didn't realize this until the bill came.

As far as main dishes, our group was really happy with everything. I had a short rib special and it was phenomenal -- even as leftovers the next day. We also ordered a few desserts to share. The tiramisu and lemon desserts were the biggest hit.

Service was great. We were there for about two hours and wouldn't have changed a thing."}
{"text":"Great Italian food in Shadyside with a cozy atmosphere. The restaurant is small but the wait is usually not too long"}
{"text":"My mom and I go here every once in a blue moon when we need some decent Italian. Our favorite dish is the spinach and ricotta ravioli. It's very good.

Everything else about this place is bad, but not bad enough to keep us away permanently.

1) Location. It's horrible. It's in a basement and is very very very small. The tables are extremely close together (you're practically sitting on top of the people next to you and sharing conversations). It makes for an uncomfortable meal if you can't get over it.

2) Parking. I just hate street parking (parallel parking, what?) There's a parking garage up the street on Bellefonte which is fine if the weather is nice. One time we did it in the frigid cold and that was dumb. Lol.

4) The wait staff is slow and every time we go they've been extremely un-attentive. Never count on a drink refill here.

5) Their house salad is weird. I'm a simple girl. I like a basic salad (with ranch which they don't have). Girasole's salad is a mixed green with sunflower vinaigrette topped with sunflower seeds. I just don't like it.

It's better than olive garden in some respects, I guess."}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I ordered the pumpkin ravioli and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date night. Very crowded, and you can expect to wait for a bit, but the food is definitely good. The appetizer we ordered was quite scrumptious (the Buratta), and the entrees were slightly less delicious but still good nonetheless. Would recommend as a place to eat, as the food is quite satisfactory, but maybe not if you were looking for a quieter, more ambient place to dine, as the restaurant can get quite boisterous."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Made reservation for New Years 2016. Walked in, greeted by someone immediately, and sat. Within seconds, greeted by our waitress, whom it was super patient, kind, warm, friendly. Red Wine and Beer for drinks.

Started with the Pane di Fungo, completely all the right combinations, balance, textures, etc. Wanted to get the spinach and ricotta ravioli, but they were all out for the evening. it did not even matter, ordered the Rigatoni which was cooked absolutely perfect al dente. Also- not over sauced, just the right balance there as well. Salads came before, which were super good with the gorgonzola on top. Timing of everything was perfect too, from drinks, salads, appetizers, dinners, and asking if we wanted dessert. 

Next to Dish on South Side, this is my next, new favorite, romantic, intimate, quaint spot in Pittsburgh. 

Owner was dining at a table in the front, and wished us Happy New Year as we left. Cannot go wrong with Girasole, doing it up right for Pittsburgh diners who know and appreciate what good true food is."}
{"text":"Let's say I am slightly biased, because I'm pretty certain I am Girasole's biggest fan... No seriously...  I recently moved to Houston (well 5 years ago now), and I literally arrange to meet family and friends at Girasole, because as much as I love my family and friends, let's face it, I plan my trips home around Girasole.  I never miss the chance to dine here...and I typically will skip lunch as I tend to eat a lot... hey Houston does NOT have decent Italian food and even if they did, it wouldn't be Girasole!  I ALWAYS have the spinach & ricotta ravioli with the salad AND of course I never skip the Gnocchi (I swear both sauces are some of the BEST in the entire world)... I usually skip white bread, but not here, I use it to scoop up the extra sauce.  The tiramisu and lemon cake are to die for as well.  Be sure to tell Pi aka Mr. Girasole that Emilie from TX sent you... it's literally my home away from home!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted to like this place, I love little restaurants like this, the rustic stone walls, the small tables, etc, they do have one drawback, when busy, they can get LOUD and this place gets very LOUD.

Service - Aloof, unknowledgeable, friendly, but overall you would probably get more professional service at your local IHOP than we did. I asked for a pronunciation on the menu, they didn't know, I asked about a product, said they were unsure what it was, and then we had to ask for the bill from a busboy after waiting and waiting for a long time. 2 Stars

Value - NO, sorry this place is expensive and the food does not match the price. We split an appetizer, had two entrees and one ice tea bill was $64 and one of the entrees was simple Polenta. 2 Stars

Food - Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but when you pay $30 for an entrée you expect a really well prepared and executed entrée. In this case I had traditional osso bucco, the shank was excellent, the marrow delicious, the risotto Milanese over-cooked and sub par. The polenta entrée was good, but the polenta was actually very plain tasting and covered with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Salads were horrendously over-dressed and our appetizer was $13 for one sausage link and a pear and taleggio crepe, it was good, probably the best dish of the meal, but I had to marvel at the cost. 3.5 stars

Bottom Line: 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Upon moving to Pittsburgh from Chicago, we were slightly ho-hummed by the food untilllllllllll happening on this quaint restaurant on the corner of walnut st.

Very cool to have a seasonal menu that changes many times a year!  My dear had the SQUID INK which was \"better than what we can find in Chicago\".  I opted for the SPINACH SPAGHETTI with tomatoes, corn and buffalo mozzarella which tasted so fresh and delightful I wish it could be summer all year round.   Corn was fresh off the cob.

Little details of the restaurant---the unique balsamic and oil container, the paintings on the wall for sale, the rustic feel--contributed to a lovely lunch and my first 5 star rating for a restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food is really good, and reasonably priced.  However, the place always seems to be packed, so it can be a little loud.  Still definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!

Pasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce... 

Dinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.  

 Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!

Overall a very disapointing night out."}
{"text":"The service here was outstanding here. The wait staff is very attentive and nice. I felt like I was sitting in my nanas kitchen. Everything homemade with an Italian-American feel. I ordered the penne. It was topped with marinara sauce with small pieces of hot sausage, topped with shredded cheese of course! The entree came with a fresh salad with a light balsamic dressing. 
It's a BYOB, with a $7 cork charge. The prices for the menu items are not bad for the portions they serve( salad and bread were included with our meal). However, the menu is not extensive, which I prefer (easier to decide). The atmosphere has a nice Italian charm to it, and the dining room is on the smaller side. So it is very easy to feel crowed. Overall, I give it a thumbs up and will return!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I went with a party of four on a Saturday night and the place was already packed. There were people lined up outside waiting to go in. Luckily I had made a reservation, however the way people are seated my the host is slightly unorganized.

The salad was a good start to the meal. I ate the pasta with ricotta, sausage and a blush sauce. It was very good, very well seasoned and cooked well. My girlfriend had grilled chicken thighs that was the pollo Del giorno. It was juicy and succulent. 

We finished with a chocolate cake, but the restaurant loses a star on dessert. Dessert was not very good.

I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Although we did not plan on going on here, we were flagged down by the owner to \"Come inside for Christ sake\" and we were pleasantly surprised. Waitresses were very friendly and accomadating. We received free pie and the sit our dishes for us. If you are lucky there is one waitress who can realllllly sing, you might hear a late night tune. I'd go again."}
{"text":"The rudest customer service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The squid linguini is now my go to dish. Being that it's a very cozy inside, think NYC small, they can at times run out of fresh items toward the end of the evening. My wife loves their gnocchi and makes me dine here at least once a month just for that dish."}
{"text":"I've recently moved away from Pittsburgh, and Girasole is one of the places I miss the most. It's tiny and can be loud, but the food is amazing, the atmosphere is fantastic, and I can't wait to go back. I'd especially recommend the pumpkin ravioli, which appears on the menu in the fall. 

Because it is small, it's well worth calling ahead for a reservation. Otherwise they will take your name and cell phone number, and you're free to wander around Shadyside until a table opens up."}
{"text":"Girasole is a great, little restaurant just off Walnut.  I love the cozy atmosphere and the decor.  I LOVE the salad and escarole & beans.  Perfect!  Vito, the owner/waiter is awesome.  They do a great job.  I think you can have parties there on Monday evenings (that take up the whole space), FYI."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I had the rustic linguine and it was so light and refreshing. Lovely atmosphere and the service was very good. A simple Italian menu and great wine list."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. 

My boyfriend and I made a reservation at this place a week in advance after several recommendations from or friends. We arrived early to our time and were seated promptly by the owner, who acted as the host. 

Unfortunately, our table for two was buried between the wall and three other larger-party tables. At first, it didn't seem too bad, comical even, to have other people shift around to let us shimmy into our seats. However, as the night wore on, our patience grew thinner as even the waiter could not walk over to our table. The staff had to pass dishes through the other table of 8 to ours. My boyfriend had to stand and walk over to the blocked space between two tables where the waiter met him and took our order. I did not speak a single word to the waiter the whole evening. 

The food itself was decent. We ordered the bruschetta and the spinach and ricotta ravioli. The ravioli came with what appeared to be tomato soup, nothing too extraordinary. I was too turned off by the poor seating arrangement and lack of care to appreciate the dishes for what they were. 

At the end of our meal, after the large party had left, we asked the waiter to speak to the manager. The host from the front came over and we began to voice our complaints. Before I could even finish my first sentence about the horrible service, Mr. Gerasole interrupted me to brag about his restaurant having operated for 17 years. He went on, saying that his face on the waiter's shirts, he wasn't going to \"win\" with us, and how we shouldn't  have any complaints with the food. When we tried to speak up again, he stopped us again, shaking his head condescendingly and sighing exasperatedly. My boyfriend, who doesn't usually voice his concerns, began to argue with him, begging him to please listen to and understand our concerns. All we got in response was his laughter. I told him this was no laughing matter and he got upset and forceful with his words. He told me that if I had had a problem with the table, I should've said something in the beginning rather than waiting the entire meal to speak up. I had placed a reservation a week in advance, showed up early to my allotted time, was hungry and did not want to wait for another table. What would even be the point in making a reservation? When we asked whether he was blaming us for the poor service, he denied vehemently. Then, he asked us what he could do and I said you could pick up our check. He responded with laughter again, saying that it would be useless since it would do nothing for his establishment. I lost all respect for this man at this point. He offered to buy us a drink or a dessert when we no longer had the appetite nor wanted to spend another minute sitting there in his restaurant.

The absolute worst cherry on top of the whole damned experience was his racist commentary at the end of the night. As we were waiting for the gift certificate he so graciously offered after refusing to cover our check, he started smiling and saying that Indians were good negotiators. This was obviously directed at my boyfriend, who didn't react. I spoke up, saying that I disagreed and did not feel his comment was appropriate. Immediately, Mr. Gerasole rolled his eyes, let out a huge sigh, and said \"here we go again\". He then bent over and said to me \"This is going to be tough, but I bet you I can guess your nationality\". I couldn't take it anymore. My boyfriend stopped him there and as soon as we got the certificate, we walked out. 

Mr. Gerasole, a word of advice. Listen to your customers, treat them with respect, and show some humility. Not only did you ruin my date night, but you also imparted an unnecessary burden on that unfortunate middle table as well. I hope no other customer has to tolerate the treatment that we experienced. You're right. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food! The menu changes, and I adore the owner who either wears a suit or a track suit! Haha 
Service is awesome as well! This restaurant has a very small setting, so be prepared for a loud atmosphere and tight seating."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.  Read some reviews about rude service, but encountered only friendly efficient service.  Jessica our server was terrific and attentive.  Yes, the tables are close and the place is a bit noisy, but only added to the charm.  Linguine Rustic was full  of clams and tasty.  Rigatoni with meat sauce was hearty and tasty.  Probably not good for groups, but ok for a couple.  Due to large portions we took desert home.  Lemon cake was excellent!"}
{"text":"If you want to have authentic old world Italian food mixed with a cozy atmosphere and excellent service, this is the place for you.

I went to Girasole this past weekend with my mom who is Italian and I throw that in there only because she knows what she's talking about when it comes to Italian food, and we both loved our meals. We both got the gnocchi and even after we were full we couldn't stop eating it.

We finished the meal with the chocolate gelato and it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Four stars because there's always room for improvement, but this restaurant is great.  Most recently there to celebrate, we shared a bottle of Prosecco and started with the escarole and beans.  Get the tortelloni with peas and prosciutto in a light cream sauce before it disappears from the menu in the summer.  The seared scallops were divine as well.  Top it off with the light, delicious coconut or lemon cake and you'll have eaten a meal fit for a king.  Service is great also.  The place is cozy (read: cramped) but trust me, you won't mind."}
{"text":"No idea why people like this restaurant. Food is mediocre and service is atrocious. The older gentleman who takes names down is horrible- he clearly has no concept of how long 10 minutes is nor does actually ever follow up to call when you put your name down. Go to Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville, infinitely better food and service."}
{"text":"Hard to get seating on Saturday and the noise level is high. Nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and good at what they do. The scallop appetizer and salads were good. I had issue with the pasta and you cant have issues with pasta in an italian restaurant.  The marinara sauce was too much tomato tasting acidic and lacked balance. The spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream, again not balanced. This place has all the elements of a good dining experience but the kitchen needs to up the game for my taste."}
{"text":"I'm wondering if I am dining at the same restaurant as these wonderful reviews. I found the food to be very unappetizing . I had linguini in red sauce with shrimp . There were 5 tiny shrimp and the whole dish was drenched in a red sauce that was very bland . The bread tasted stale and the salad had no dressing. I thought the menu choices were quite limited.

Yes the restaurants was crowded and people were seated on top of each other. The wait staff was fine. Beware this restaurant is not handicapped accessible. The owner did help my husband with his walker and he was gracious.

I have been to much better Italian restaurants and I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Came to Girasole with my girlfriend for our two year anniversary after receiving a recommendation from a friend. 

For being located in what is basically a basement, the interior of Girasole is special, due to the fact that it is tastefully adorned with interesting art pieces, plenty of sunflowers, and has the feel of many of the restaurants I enjoyed while studying in Italy.

My date and I enjoyed wine by the glass, a cut of incredibly fresh filet mignon which rested on a flavorful bed of risotto, and cheesecake for dessert.

I forget what night of the week we came, but a gentlemen with an acoustic guitar walked around the restaurant, tastefully serenading tables with an interesting blend of music which ranged from the Beatles to James Taylor to Dean Martin.

I will be dreaming about this meal for quite some time and am almost afraid to come back to Girasole for fear of sullying my incredible first impression.

The only downside to Girasole is that you are packed into the small dining area with many other guests which creates a very noisy environment. Probably not ideal for a first date if you're looking to have conversation, unless you like yelling all night. Fortunately for me, I didn't need to discuss much with my doll and seeing her beautiful face enjoy a great meal and music on our anniversary was more than satisfying for me."}
{"text":"Girasole was much hyped about by my friends but I was very underwhelmed. I dined there on a Thursday evening around 6.30 pm. It was a fairly cold evening so we sat inside. The atmosphere was quaint but the noise was so loud. We had to continually ask one another to repeat themselves. 

The meal itself was nice but nothing outstanding. Each meal comes with complementary bread and a side salad. A plus is that the menu is quite seasonal. I had the roast chicken with brioche stuffing, brussel spouts and pumpkin whipped mashed potato and my friend had the scallops with chorizo, farro, shrimp and a pea puree. The later was 1/3 the sized of mine. Portion sizing here is definitely not their strong suit. I highly advise asking about this before order, especially for men!

Service-wise the waiter was attentive and helpful. However, I was a little thrown back to observe the waitresses placing the complimentary bread into the basket with her bare hands... I was not impressed. Are a pair of tongs really that difficult to find in a restaurant??

Overall, Girasole is a nice place but over priced and very noisy."}
{"text":"Visiting the east coast makes me realize how bad the average bay area Italian place is. Sure you can find good stuff, but the standard on the east coast is way higher. 

Time to snap back to reality.

In bay area terms, this is a solid Italian restaurant, offering familiar items such as gnocchi, polenta, and risotto. I actually quite like the way they prepared their pasta, and the dishes come in quite an American portion too (read: big).

However, the food itself tasted a little less fresh than I'd like. Maybe the harsh winter was to blame, as it was still quite chilly in May when we revisited lately. Either way, after living on the other coast and longing for good Italian food, this does satisfy a little bit with the well-prepared pasta, but it also leaves me longing for more."}
{"text":"This place is right by my church and I've always walked by it, but never stopped to eat here. Ate here for lunch today and I enjoyed it! They have outdoor seating so it's real nice when the weather's nice.

The staff is super friendly. The owner (I think that's who he was) walks around and makes sure everything is all good and the other staff members are nice as well. 

The food is pretty good! I got the potato gnocchi, YUM. I also enjoy when entrees come with a soup or salad, which this place did. 

Only thing is.. we didn't have utensils for the longest time and our server didn't notice even when she brought us our salads. Brought our salads and then left. We had to flag somebody else down to get them.

I would come here again (:"}
{"text":"I gave it only one star because, 0 stars was not an option.  I had made a reservation there 3 weeks in advance.   When we arrived the place was packed but, I was not worried because I had reservations for 4.  Well, we were not even greeted.  I had to chase down someome to let them know we were there and had a reservation.  They basically ignored me.  Soon after we arrived more people came in that had reservations.  They ignored them as well.  I have no idea why we even stuck it out an hour after our reservation time but we did.  As we were waitng the old man sat some 2 tops before us that did not have reservations.  I said to him why not put two two tops together?  He said, \"ugh we can't do that.\"  I was now livid because we had reservations and this is now 45 min. after our time.  So, then I said we can even split up but, he then proceeded to tell me that he had obligations to the parties of 2!?!?!  They didn't even have reservations!!!!!!!!   Apparently, reservations mean nothing!  Do not offer reservations if you are not going to honor that obligation.  Obviously, we will never go back!  Also,  after I told people about our experience they had a similar one there.  Not quite as bad as ours though.  Apparently, the old man caters to his friends and regulars.  Which is a good thing but, not at the cost of other patrons."}
{"text":"The staff, the food and the wine are all amazing. A great atmosphere for lunch or dinner. The vibe is one of a kind. Some of the reviews complain about the wait...it's well worth it. Put your name on the list and walk the pleasant neighborhood until you're table is ready. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about Girasole. She is Italian and said it's one of the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. My husband surprised me and took me there for my birthday. It was a beautiful evening so we opted to sit outside. Later we were very glad because the restaurant was packed inside. It's a small restaurant but it was still a little crazy to see how packed it was on a Tuesday night. That's a sign of a great restaurant. 
I started off by ordering a Bellini. It's my favorite adult beverage. I think it was 90% champagne, which was fine with me. We ordered our meals and chatted and people watched while we waited on our food. They brought our salads first. The salads had mixed greens, chick peas, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, carrots, and goat cheese. It was delicious!!!
Next our entrees were served. I had ordered one of the specials-Seafood Risotto. It had lobster, shrimp, scallops, and octopus. All of the pieces of seafood were large. No skimping there!  The risotto was cooked perfectly and had an amazing flavor. It was some of the best I have ever had. The octopus was on top and it had been grilled to perfection. 
My husband ordered the Linguine with Clams. The noodles were homemade and were also some of the best we ever had. There were so many clams that he had to use two bread plates to hold all of the shells. The sauce-white wine, garlic, and butter-was so good that we were dipping our bread from our bread basket into it. 
For dessert we shared a piece of coconut cake. There were two layers of the lightest and fluffiest cake I have ever eaten. Between the two layers was a vanilla custard. It was iced with white icing and then covered on coconut. In my world there is no such thing as too much coconut. 
I was beyond pleased with the food and the service. It is now on my list as a favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of our sons favorite places.  He gave me a gift card for my birthday and last night we had dinner there.  I must say that it was a very enjoyable evening.  PIE, the owner, greets you at the door, you are introduced to his wife, Patty, who is pleasant and welcoming.   Now the server welcomes you and you instantly start chatting.  The place is tastefully decorated, warm and welcoming and now the food arrives. I had the Swordfish special and I can honestly say I have never had a better pieces of fish. My husband had the Pasta Aolio with fresh clams and spinach.  The house salad was quite a meal in itself, fresh greens topped with gorgonzola, it was delightful.  This will definitely be a regular dinner spot for us.  Definitely a 5."}
{"text":"The squid ink pasta is really good. This place is very small and in the basement. It's very loud when everyone is talking, and you have to sit very close to people in another table"}
{"text":"Chose the chicken special. Nothing special about it; bland and unappealing. It looked like a boiled chicken leg. Atmosphere was very loud considering it was a weekday mid-afternoon. I'd hate to be in there when It's crowded. Service was good. Overall impression?  Meh, there are so many better options I can't recommend spending your money here. 

Patti,

Thank you for your courteous and prompt response; it speaks to your professionalism and the image you wish your restaurant to reflect. If I return, I will be sure to update my review to reflect my experience."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my original review on Girasole, I read the earlier reviews from people who have reported bad experiences with the drunk/rude man who is in charge of seating people.  It's too bad that the restaurant hasn't done anything to fix the problem, especially after so many people have objected to the treatment that they received."}
{"text":"Great food, great location, ok service. Sometimes you have to wait for a table despite your reservation. It has a great Italian atmosphere and everyone is talking loudly which makes it a great place for a date or a dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food in Pittsburgh. Great vibe. Must get the bruschetta for an appetizer and lemon cake for dessert... you can pick whatever you want for an entree and you'll be happy about it. 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"I wandered into this place on a snowy Thursday night and it was absolutely amazing.  We were pretty lucky to get a table because it's a super small place.  The food was absolutely amazing - the mushroom bruscetta was out of this world and the polenta was to die for.  It's fairly unusual to find vegetarian Italian food so remarkable.  Service was great, especially for such a small space.

I'd recommend Girasole for special occasions.  It's a cozy little spot."}
{"text":"Pretty darn tasty. Walked in on a whim after a busy night shopping on Walnut and enjoyed the food immensely. It's a noisy and busy atmosphere but that was fine since it was fun to talk a bit to our neighbors. 

Just don't expect a romantic, quiet evening to yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place. Down home little Italian place with a lot of atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"I've had quite a time finding a good local restaurant but am pleased that Girasole has finally filled that need for me. It is tucked away in Shadyside, under, I might add, one of the best places to get ice cream in the city. 

We went for lunch, on a weekday, and the place was packed but we were given a table quickly and the service, overall, was fast and friendly. Their lunch menu did not have a lot of options - but I would rather see a place focus on a few items and do them really well than spread themselves over several mediocre offerings. I opted for the potato gnocchi in a marinara with fresh mozzarella and my husband ordered the penne in marinara with roasted chicken... bot of us were really happy with our entrees. For me, the star was the salad. I am never a real fan of salads in restaurants but this one was excellent. The lettuce was fresh and perfectly balanced - garbanzo beans, Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds, shaved red onion, and nicoise olives (the only thing that I left on the plate) dressed with a house sunflower vinaigrette dressing. 

I'd certainly recommend this for a casual lunch/dinner -- I really want to head back if only just for the salad! In warmer months they also offer seating outside.... for dessert, head upstairs for some amazing gelatto."}
{"text":"Had the white bean sausage and greens. Fantastic delish and holy cow good. Service from Maddie was outstanding.  Great friendly service and oh yeah, Pie walking around with a red glass of wine. Yinz get here"}
{"text":"Not off to a good start. I was looking to make reservations for tonight and knowing the marathon is tomorrow I figured I would look a little outside of the city. I came across this restaurant and thought it looked charming and the food looks nice. I called and a man answered and told me to hold on. Then asked me what I wanted. I asked if they were taking reservations and he said nothing till 10 in a very rude tone. I said ok thank you have a.... And he hung up on me. Won't even bother checking this place out if that's how they treat customers. I will give your neighbors the business because they were not rude to me on the phone. 

Update ** my fiancé found this on yelp - he knew I had a negative review but ensured me that it probably wouldn't happened again so he called. Same treatment - he was blown away and it is incredibly frustrating when someone hangs up with out any  goodbye or have a nice night. He just. Barked that they had nothing available and hung up. This place really needs to get someone else to answer their phones because I feel like telling everyone to not waste their time on this place."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in the area. Not a new comer, but finally able to review this restaurant properly! The owner is there every time I'm there which to me, symbolizes the hospitality, down to earth, and homey feel. It's cozy, pretty casual, and normally busy. I highly recommend a reservation! They don't do real reservations, so there is still a chance of a wait; however, it puts you near the head of the line. They offer outdoor seating which is nice when the weather is warmer. Oh, and BYOB

The food is a good portion, on the larger side (I always take half to go!), and delicious. They change their menu every so often to keep with the season. The prices are on the higher end, but I think it's worth the spend if you're craving good Italian food. This time I opted for the orecchiette (aglio e olio, rapini, and sausage) $18; the sausage was tasty and the sauce (garlic and oil) was light. All their pastas come with a salad or soup. There penne, potato gnocchi, and risotto are popular choices! To finish off, we had the coconut cake which was fluffy and topped with the right amount of coconut and icing. Perfect way to finish off the meal. I look forward to trying one of their special menu items!"}
{"text":"Fair at best.  Crowded tables, food quality fair, prices too high.  Do not recommend, much better options throughout city."}
{"text":"Really great meal and excellent service! It was one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh in months. It was a packed house but the entire staff was patient and friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun, and I always leave satisfied. Can you ask for more?

Food: The gnocchi is one of my all-time favs. It's quick & great for take-out too. Their house salad dressing is AMAZING. The winter menu has this crimini & prosciutto ravioli that is seriously dangerous. It's so good. The tiramisu - again - amazing.

Atmosphere: Cute for a date, wouldn't recommend bringing a crowd. Can get kind of loud, but I think it's fun & cozy.

Extras: The service is always fast & you can BYOB even though there is a wine list. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is to die for.
I highly recommend this place; however, there are a few things you should be aware of. 
This place is super small. It's always packed, so make a reservation. Because its so small, walking to and from your table can be a bit awkward as you try to avoid disturbing all the other patrons. The noise level is pretty high, too. Again, because of the close quarters."}
{"text":"I was able to come to Girasole for Pittsburgh restaurant week. My friend had called earlier and made a pseudo-reservation with the owner and he told us to come in around 9. When we arrived, several patrons had still not been seated even though the owner had verbally told them a certain time. Some of the customers had \"reservations\" at 8 and we still not seated. I don't know if Girasole was overwhelmed that night because of Pittsburgh restaurant week but it was difficult to find the hostess/host. 

On the food side, I ended up not getting any of the dishes offered during Pittsburgh restaurant week because I wanted to try their traditional Italian dishes. I got the white clam sauce which was delicious. However, my favorite part of the meal was actually their side salad. I also loved how their olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dispenser was all in one for their complimentary bread. I also chose to try their Turkish coffee gelato which was the best coffee gelato I've had in awhile. I definitely will come back when it's less busy and hopefully I can change my opinion about the service."}
{"text":"We were seated outside, not on the sidewalk like others but down a few steps by the below  street-level entrance. It was a lovely late-spring evening, so the seating was perfect. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer with artichoke, pesto, and a pine nut relish--a little to much relish but generally good. The house salad with the entree was delicious--spring mix with sunflower seeds, chick peas, olives, tomatoes, Gorgonzola cheese, and a light vinaigrette dressing. I ordered the penne with sausage for my entree. The Italian sausage was a tad spicy for my taste. Others ordered penne and grilled chicken and the ravioli with spinach and ricotta . I tried the chicken and it was very good. Our waiter,Vito, was very personable and provided good service."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Girasole? An Italian owner who wanders around the restaurant (often with a glass of wine) greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff; a friendly staff; and fantastic food. Seriously, the food is great. Order anything on the menu & you won't be disappointed.

The best part about Girasole, though, is the intimate indoor & outdoor atmosphere & the wine. Pours are generous, and there's a fantastic selection to choose from. If you're having difficulty, your server will be happy to help you, too (ask for Ryan). Did I mention the wine? Seriously, the pours are generous, and if you MUST bring your own, bring a lot, because the corking fee is very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Friday night and surprising were seated immediately at a sidewalk table even though we did not have a reservation. Girasole was, as advertised, a very charming cafe with many things to recommend it. 

The food was good, but it lost some points with both of us for quality of service and the limited nature of the menu. Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.  There was a busboy but he was kind of useless. 

My husband had the ravioli and I had polenta, both of which were very nice, and we shared a slice of rum cake that was excellent. My suggestion to anyone going there is to look at the online menu first. What you see there is what they will have, period. If nothing looks good it may be a good night to try another spot."}
{"text":"Amazing. The squid ink pasta when in season is to die for. Their gnocchi is delicious. The atmosphere is cozy. I have never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday with my sister,  mom,  niece & my two son's girlfriends.   The waitress was great & as always,  the food was awesome!   This was the second time there & I would always recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. I got the short rib special and it was melt in my mouth delicious."}
{"text":"i know i'm probably going to look pretty bad for not giving the usual four or five stars. but my experience wasnt that great. 

food: my spinach ravioli was pretty good. sadly my salad was over dressed, like wet. i looked over and the other lady's salad was just fine. maybe they had it against the one top. 

service: i was promptly seated and greeted with a warm smile. bread arrived as i was viewing the menu (very nice) my waiter seemed nice at first. i over heard him ask another one top if he was going to get dessert. so i was looking forward to dessert. as the meal progressed all the other servers were fine. but sadly when i was done with my entree i wasnt offered dessert. instead i got my check RIGHT as soon as my plate was taken away. i was kinda annoyed that i didnt get the SAME one top service as the other man. i tipped 20% anyway because i used to serve. i probably wont be coming back because of the lack of attention to a single diner. *for me you need to treat all customers with the same attention regardless if they are alone or not.

decor: the place itself is cute. had i gotten better service i might give this place more stars.

i wont be coming back unless someone specifically ask to come here. i rather go where they treat everyone the same."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my brother's graduation from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. Though the reviews were great and food looked yummy, it wasn't exactly how I pictured it. Wasn't aware that the restaurant was SMALL, but we didn't mind sitting outside on a nice sunny day. The menu consisted of simple list of seasonal items. I ordered the spinach ricotta ravioli while my mother and brother ordered the spaghettini with clams. Bread basket is given to much on and a small salad is served with your meal. Very fresh and clean.

The disappointment started to set in when our food came in. My ravioli only had five pieces and didn't have much filling inside. Can barely taste the spinach. The tomato cream sauce looked old also. The spaghettini my brother and mother ordered looked really good and I wish I could've ordered that instead. They seemed to enjoy it very much.

Italian food is generally expensive, but the quality I was served? Not worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, setting, and service! Plan your meal ahead because there is limited seating, but the outdoor patio is magical. This place is perfect for a romantic night out or a special occasion. Pair it with pre-dinner drinks next door at Le Madri Gras and you have the recipe for a perfect evening.
Don't skip the appetizers and don't mind the close eating quarters. The low lighting and the low rumble of close conversation adds to the romantic atmosphere.
The food is special, unique and tastes as if it was made specifically for you by an old Italian woman in her kitchen.
Do not hesitate to try this place. It is truly the backbone of a magnificent evening."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  The service is very good.  It is small (yes, cramped) and the tables are all right next to each other and hard for the staff to maneuver especially when customers are going to their table.  Some may say romantic but it is very noisy.  Just a good place to dine.  I do say dine not to eat.   We started with some wine and asked the waitress to wait before we ordered our appetizers.  She was very accommodating.  We ordered our appetizers, I split the beans and greens with sausage with my significant other.  Hard to go wrong with this appetizer.  We then ordered our main course and I went with one of my favorites, Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli that comes in a tomato cream sauce.  
The pasta's rock at Girasole.  
You get the soup or house salad with your meal.  I had the salad because it is one of the fresher and better salads in the area.  The salad has a combination of fresh greens, some chickpeas, olive and a great house made dressing.  
If you are in a hurry and don't want to dine this is not your place.  We came with a small group to enjoy the food and each others company but one in our group kept wondering about the time and was annoying.  Just come enjoy the food and the people you are with."}
{"text":"I have had 3 wonderful meals here however, you should be prepared for the smallest venue in the city. The servers also have no bartender, so those hand crafted cocktails are their additional responsibility. So take it easy on them. Food is always delicious but the space is incredibly tight."}
{"text":"I've been going to Girasole's for years with my family and friends. I've had basically every vegetarian and fish dish, always to a great pleasure. The wine list is short but excellently prepared, the chianti is always superb - sempre! 
For those who complain about space clearly do not understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away. Either people would complain about their not being enough tables or that there isn't enough room, Girasoles choose the latter. Dinners are too spoiled in Pittsburgh, they expect good food to be accompanied by enough space for a family of 8, not to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners - though I have no idea why? 
I recommend going for lunch - particularly if you don't like crowds. You'll most likely get to meeting Phi or Geno which guarantees great conversation and a great experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the, not the best kept secrets, in Shadyside.  Solid Italian food, great atmosphere both inside and out, and family owned and run. Have eaten here dozens of times, and never had a bad meal. If there was only one criticism, it might be the drink selection. By that I mean cocktails.  There's not a dedicated bartender, and the drinks are made by the servers who are already too busy.  The wine selection is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little retreat, and a great place for gnocchi. It's not my favorite Italian restaurant, but it's up there.

The space is in the basement of a commercial building off Walnut on Copland. (for locals, Jen's Juice bar was above it.) The stone walls and low ceiling feel a bit like a wine cellar (which works) but all the hard surfaces and open kitchen mean it can get very loud (doesn't work so well.) On a busy Friday, don't talk about anything you wouldn't want strangers to hear - they are mere inches away!

I don't order pasta unless it's fussy or unique - most places use dry pasta anyway and usually the items are things I can make at home. That being said, I love gnocchi and it is made fresh here. The difference between the dry stuff in the store and fresh is night and day. My favorite dish - a simple gnocchi w/ marinara and fresh mozzarella - is heaven on earth. Sometimes simple is best.

They have one of the best house salads in town - a wonderful vinegarette dressing on mixed greens, garbanzos, sunflower seeds, and blue cheese. It's a nice touch, but the portions are generous enough that it could be offered a la carte - say $4 for the salad and knock $2 off the entree prices.

Around fall, look for seasonal specials like butternut squash ravioli w/ walnut pesto cream sauce. 

If I'm in the mood for beans and greens, gnocchi, or maybe a seasonal dish, I'd go here. The entrees didn't captivate me as much. For Italian entrees, I prefer Piccolo Fiorno. Choose the right dish, and I expect you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.

You're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.

The menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful. 

Almost as tasty as that good night kiss."}
{"text":"Intimate decor/setting, but can often get noisy. We tried the spinach ricotta ravioli and gnocchi and both were amazing. The filling of the ravioli was light yet flavorful but what really tied together the dish was the blush sauce - I wish I could buy jars and jars of this! (Definitely good for dipping with the bread they give you) The gnocchi as well was well-baked and paired well with the fresh mozzarella. 

However, I've called and made reservations here multiple times but have still had to wait 20-30 mins so be sure to factor that into your dinner plans. There's lots of stores to walk around nearby if you do find yourself waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle."}
{"text":"my most Favorite italian restaurant in pittsburgh. squid ink linguine had so much lobster meat in it"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Although we had reservations for 7 pm, we had to wait over thirty minutes for our \"reserved table.\" They need to have a better understanding of how to hold tables or just don't take reservations. The restaurant was very crowded and there was no room to wait. It was just a disorganized, chaotic mess. My party ended up going to Starbucks across the street to wait, while we left one person in the restaurant. 

The food was fine nothing extraordinary. The bread was not warm. The house salad was normal. I had the cocoa fettuccine with gorgonzola, pistachio, and cauliflower. The dish was good, but a bit oily for my liking. They were out of tiramisu for dessert, which was disappointing. I got the pistachio cheesecake, which was ok. Overall, I will not be back as the service for getting seated was terrible. They need to learn proper manners when dealing with guests who have reservations."}
{"text":"Called to see about making a reservation and whether or not they talk walk ins. The guy who answered the phone told me I could \"come to the door\" and then hung up on me.

Guess they were busy, but that turned me off from wanting to try the restaurant."}
{"text":"Girasole restaurant in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Was an excellent Italian place. It was very authentic and the food was really good. The atmosphere was wonderful and we loved it."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food that is well worth the wait, make a reservation as this place books fast and is small.   Nothing like it in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Having lived a short three blocks away from Girasole, this is the perfect date night place! It's BYOB ($7/person charge) and is romantically quaint, hidden gem of Walnut Street. I have ate here on a number of occasions - whether its been on a date, with family, with girlfriends, or picking up takeout - Girasole ALWAYS delivers. I have yet to come across Italian that beats it in Pittsburgh. The Spinach Ravioli is my go-to. The salad to start with sunflower dressing and garbanzo beans is amazing. 

I've tried quite a few 'fish specials' as well. Always worth the shot. 

Not interested in BYOB? Girasole's Pinot Grigio is always nice."}
{"text":"I really, really love Girasole.  We've been here many times over the years and it is always jammed, always great and always nostalgic.  The owner is so courteous and I love how he visits from table to table, having a glass of wine with the guests.  Reminds me of my grandfather's generation of Italian relatives.

I wish I still lived in Pittsburgh, I would be at Girasole on a very regular basis.  Everything is good."}
{"text":"I am giving 3.5 stars because I feel that service is sub par. Granted our server was new and trying her best. But where are the service standards? We made a 7:30 reservation and waited 30 mins. The gentleman that walks around with a glass of wine never offers you a glass while you stand and wait. The waiter/waitress plates your dessert after handling money.  Do you know how dirty money is? But after watching that could you at least but a fork in front of a person instead of leaving 4 forks on the dessert plate and never bringing a share plate out.  The food was ok., even though 2 of the orders came out wrong. Mistakes happen In the beginning of any new job. The starter salad is delicious. We had a appetizer that was also very good. My ravioli was mediocre."}
{"text":"The good, the bad, and the delicious!

This is hands down my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Yes, it's tough to get in, and yes it's TINY, but it's so delicious and so worth it (get the polenta or gnocchi).

Here's the bad...If you are going to a weekend, be prepared to have to be patient even if you have a \"reservation.\" And yes, Jimmy, the owner/host can be a little gruff (I think it's endearing- and he's actually a very nice person).  However, once you sit, The wait staff is always nice and the food is great-even the salad!).

I recommend going at lunch or during the week for the best experience. I took my parents from out of town once for lunch and jimmy even gave them a tour and introduced them to his family. They now ask every time we go into town if we can go to \"that little Italian place with that guy\"."}
{"text":"Great, affordable Italian food.  The food is always great, the service is pretty good, and the atmosphere is really nice.  I love it in the summer especially when they open up the small patio for dining as well.  The owner is always walking around with a glass of wine chatting it up.  Also, one of the few BYOB places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Have been a few times and really enjoy it; but as people note, it is very small and the tables are right on top of each other. So it's very loud, but that's manageable. 

However; one problem this causes: there's no sort of dress code, and apparently we live in a society where dudebros think it's acceptable to go out to a nice restaurant wearing a tanktop. I don't care if you're trying to show off the guns, take that crap to Mario's, this is a nice restaurant and I'm not trying to smell your tanning oil and pits. 

Wouldn't be a problem if people had a basic level of decency, but gentlemen should be refused service if they lack sleeves or closed toe shoes. Keep your pits and feet away from the rest of us trying to enjoy a nice Italian meal."}
{"text":"Girasole is a small, quaint, italian restaurant just off walnut st in the heart of shadyside's business district.  The ambience is such that it can be romantic for a date, yet also allow for families and larger parties to have a good time.  

The food was above average for pittsburgh italian, 4 stars for sure.  It just is difficult for me to find many, if any, restaurants in pittsburgh that can match the quality of restaurants in philly or nyc.  I had a special that had scallops, shrimp, on a polenta bed with spinach, and it was as tasty as it sounds.   Most of my friends enjoyed their meals.

The issue came with wine.  They have a unique concept of serving their own wine while also allowing you to BYO.  They do serve a corkage fee, however, they absurdly charge a per person, per glass charge instead of one price for the bottle! It's a CORKAGE fee, charge for the bottle! Between 8 of us, we spent nearly $70 on 2 measly bottles of wine, that is absolutely ridiculous.  I could have drank one of their wines and it would have been cheaper (but not better).  And when I inquired about it, they went with the thats our policy line, though, the waitress did subliminally acknowledge the absurdity of their policy.

Overall, still, worth visiting for the above average italian cuisine with solid specials and pleasant ambience."}
{"text":"I have been to Girasole 3 times now, once in June, August and today. Here are my thoughts over all three of my visits.

The atmosphere is inherently romantic, except that the popularity of the restaurant combined with the small space makes it difficult for it to be an intimate outing on a weekend (I've been there on Friday and Sunday evenings for dinner, not sure the situation on weekdays). Sometimes it can get pretty loud.

However, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their entrees come with a house salad that is exquisite: sometimes I look forward to it more than the pasta! It has this great tart dressing with gorgonzola cheese and roasted pine nuts. Absolutely divine.

I've tried three entrees:

1) Cavatelli with lamb sausage - light sauce, very flavorful meatballs. Loved trying a new pasta

2) Penne with grilled chicken - a constant on an otherwise seasonal menu; this is my BF's staple order but was a bit too safe for me

3) The famous cheese and spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce - THE BEST RAVIOLI I've ever had. Dipped the bread in the extra sauce, this will definitely be my order moving forward!"}
{"text":"What a production! I don't even know where to start...

The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.  

Sure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.  

So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.  

We started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!

I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!  

Much to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!  

But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams \"get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!\" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!  

I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.   

I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant over the holidays while visiting Pittsburgh.  It came as a recommendation from a family member and I did read current Yelp reviews before we went.  The owner is truly as abrupt as mentioned in other reviews.  Knowing this going in helped as otherwise you are truly stunned by his behavior in a service Industry. The food was good.  The service once seated was swift and obviously looking to turn tables as the line at the door was constant.  Is the food good enough to overcome the atmosphere...that is up to you!"}
{"text":"After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\"...\"Sure, what is it?\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole."}
{"text":"After my bad service experience at Girasole, the manager apologized and compensated me for my troubles. I would definitely go back, considering that the unfortunate situation I encountered was out of the norm for this usually friendly, cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"The weather has been beautiful and to celebrate I chose to have a lovely filet of grilled salmon. It was the perfect accent to the wonderful weather. Unfortunately for dinner they do not take reservations. I would say that fact is the businesses biggest downfall. Also there is no area to wait comfortably. You are then forced to Impinge on others dinner experience since there is no removed place to sit and wait."}
{"text":"Girasole is a small Italian restaurant off Walnut Street that serves up decent Italian food.  I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.

Their menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.

While we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.

The wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.

The ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.

I've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.

I would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! The food is okay, but the owner is an insane drunk that will ruin your entire dining experience! On more than one occasion he has yelled at me, my friends, and even my girlfriend--all because we asked 'how long is the wait.' It's the most DISGUSTING behavior I've ever witnessed and the restaurant should be closed down because of it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and authentic Italian. Definitely the best in Pittsburgh! It even gives my mom's Italian red sauce serious competition, and I've never said that before about any other sauce!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place in a very quaint setting.  I had the spinach ravioli and it was fantastic.  Reasonably priced.  Enjoyed the intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"I reccomend Girasole to anyone who wants to try something different and not empty their wallets. It's the perfect date night restaurant. I've been here many times, sometimes for lunch, other times for dinner. I prefer to go there for lunch.

They have a rotating menu that incorporates seasonal ingredients. For example, the fall menu has pumpkin ravioli in a sage cream sauce, whereas their summer menu features squid ink linquini in a light cream sauce with lobster. (both are delicious!)

My \"tried and true\" at Girasole is the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a tomato cream sauce. I always end up sopping up the extra sauce with my bread. Don't judge me. 
 
Every pasta entree comes with unlimited bread and the \"girasole\" salad, which is topped with gorgonzola, garbanzo beans and sunflower seeds. Yum! (If you do not like onions, be sure to request to have them removed from the salad, otherwise you will be tasting them all night). 

All in all, Girasole is one of my favorite restaurants in town. I docked it a perfect rating because after several weekend dinner reservations, my party was ALWAYS forced to wait over an hour. I understand that at a small business, wait times can be unpredictable. But there are other small(er!) restaurants in Pittsburgh that do not have this problem. I believe that up to a thirty minute wait is acceptable. But an hour each time? No.  Either stop accepting reservations or change the way you accept patrons. 

This is why I really like their lunch. The prices are cheaper, the portions are absolutely perfect, and it is never crowded."}
{"text":"I don't know if coming early would help any... but when we got there at 8pm, the place was hoppin'. There were people seated from as close to the kitchen and all the way up the stairs by the sidewalk. There were hopefuls milling about a bit to get down and place their name for a seating. When we were able to reach the desk, the wait time was 50 minutes.

We went to Mercurio's for a while, took a stroll around Walnut, and eventually sat down by some very convenient benches nearby. After what we thought was 'adequate' wait time, we peered a bit over the fence and down towards the man (who we think may have been the owner). After a bit, he nodded at us, and started moving a couple of tables around inside. We took that as a signal, meaning, \"Come on down. I'm wrestling these tables apart for you.\"

We ordered the carne special (steak with alfredo for $30) and the torcia ($15). I wouldn't say that they were the best that i'd ever had, but they were pretty good. The vegetables are fresh; the pasta was just right and sauced/souped enough to my liking. The service, provided mostly by Diane, was excellent. She was friendly and attentive, despite the throngs of customers. The crowds are loud, the atmosphere very.. cozy.. and the walkways very narrow, and, yet, the food and drinks keep coming, accident-free. It seems like it could be highly stressful for the servers, but Diane was smiling every time she came back. Awesome."}
{"text":"We are fairly new to Pittsburgh and came across Girasole's and fell in love. Excellent food and top notch service. There are some quirky things about this place but if you want standard boring food then the better place would be Olive Garden.

Anyways, we love to come here. Everything from the fresh daily specials to great Italian pasta dishes you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Friday at 5pm my co-workers and I went on the recommendation of someone. We were just visiting the city for literally a hot minute. We were welcomed at the door and seated at a table in the back. We immediately loved the décor. Our waitress came over and offered us water right away and took our order for any drinks.  She returned in a timely manner with our drinks and took our order. I ordered the Pumpkin Ravioli. My friends each had a pasta dish, one with shrimp, one with meat. We read the Yelp reviews to be nosey. I can see what Judy means about space. It's very tiny. But don't let that our anything else in that review deter you from visiting here! Our food was the perfect temperature and I loved the Pumpkin Ravioli! It was the just the right amount (I believe 5 raviolis, maybe 6).. I'm not sure.. I was hungry and we were literally on time restraints for me to really keep track of details. My friends raved about their pasta dishes. We got our check and it was $62.. three different dishes, one soda. Maybe a tad pricey, but when the company is paying.. the price doesn't seem to bother you. As we left, a gentleman sitting by the door said \"Good night, Thank You\" and was very friendly. My experience was a great one. It really is a cute little find and great options to choose from. I'd say GO! Definitely!"}
