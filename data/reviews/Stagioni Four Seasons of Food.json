{"text":"Awful. The noise level is deafening. Right after the four of us paid paid several hundred dollars for dinner, we were asked to vacate our table because someone else was waiting for it. Wait, what?! None of us will ever go there again nor will we recommend it. Too bad because one of the group is on the board of a large public company HQ in Charlotte. Stagioni won't get a second chance to make a good first impression."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant given the rustic Tuscan decor. I must say I was quite underwhelmed by the service and food. We were a group of eight who meet monthly to share a fine dinning experience. Our waitress while knowledgable about the menu was very blah to say the least. Bread was placed on the table in small bags without explanation. No explanation was given for herbs already in bread plates either. My entree of NC trout was very bland as well as the day's special Grouper. A few persons in the party had wine and one person's glass was removed before being empty. Whew. Maybe an off night, but I would not frequent this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We went here when my parents were visiting. We had a large group and the restaurant was very accommodating when we showed up with a few extra people. The service was first-rate, and the food was absolutely delicious. The portion sizes were perfect, and there was a large dessert selection. We also enjoyed the drink selection."}
{"text":"I was so excited when Stagioni opened because I live right around the corner and was hoping it could become a new go-to in the neighborhood.  Maybe I was there on a bad night, but there were so many things wrong with our meal.  First off, the service was terrible.  Our waiter wasn't knowledgeable about the menu or the bar, and seemed disinclined to answer basic questions or do anything (including refilling our water glasses) to take care of our party of four.  It took forever to get drinks and longer to get our food.  At one point when we were attempting to order our food, our waiter literally turned away and began talking with someone from the kitchen as we all sat and watched. When the food did arrive, the plates were dropped in front of us. I ended up with my friend's cauliflower pizza and a Peewee Herman-sized pair of scissors to cut the pizza. Not only was it extremely gimmicky and silly, it was also awkward watching her cut a pizza with a pair of giant kitchen scissors.  Our meals were all extremely salty and mediocre at best. Luckily, our waiter had left a carafe of water at the table so we could refill our glasses ourselves.  We were repeatedly interrupted mid-conversation by bus staff and our waiter, suddenly all anxious to move us along with our meal.  They removed our plates before we had swallowed our last bites. Still optimistic, we ordered dessert which arrived almost immediately.  Just as we began to eat the gelato that was melting on the hot plate it came out, the open concept kitchen, which we were seated adjacent to, began breaking down.  Within minutes, cleaning chemicals began wafting at our table and through the dining room.  I could understand this if it had been midnight and we were the only table remaining, but it was 9:45 and the restaurant was still at least half full.  One of the people in our party has a lung condition, so we choked down a few more bites and headed out.  The grand total for our meal:  $300.    For less money and a far better experience, I'll head a few doors down to Terra, which offers gluten free options (we asked at Stagioni and were told, \"we don't have anything gluten free.\"), a cozy environment, knowledgeable waitstaff and great food."}
{"text":"I tried to make a reservation here for a family celebration for a party of 12. The staff was extremely rude and manager initially refused to come to the phone. When he did, he stated their system could not put in a twelve top before 8pm. I ate at Stagioni a few nights prior and they told me it wouldn't be a problem. When calling to confirm with a credit card they changed the reservation time and were not accommodating. My family has been in the wine and restaurant business for over 20 years. This type of \"service\" lost them a large party of customers. The bartender was however, fantastic. We will be dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ever since reading about the opening of Stagioni, we'd been looking forward to trying it. We decided to try it for our 2nd wedding anniversary on a recent Monday evening. We made a 7:30 reservation and were promptly seated when we arrived a few minutes early. They have prosecco on tap and a large Italian wine list. Unfortunately, that's all we got to enjoy for quite a while, as it took 45 minutes to place our dinner order. We ordered 2 appetizers, a pizza to share, and two pasta dishes. The mussels appetizer never arrived, and we got to watch the kitchen staff clean the kitchen as we finally got our entrees. By this time we were so aggravated and exhausted that we completely skipped dessert, and to add insult to injury it still took another 15 minutes to get the check sorted (including removing the charge for the missing appetizer.) Our server was very friendly and pretty knowledgeable about the menu, but seemed to have half the tables in the restaurant in his section, and almost all of those tables were seated within about 10-15 minutes of us. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be making a return trip any time soon."}
{"text":"Went there with several folks from work earlier this week.  Its really nice inside, good local beer on tap, and then the wheels came off....  Service was awful.  Couldn't get a drink refill to save our life, appetizers took 45 minutes plus to get to the table, entrees delivered to the wrong folks, etc.  Food was awful.  I had the trout entr√©e.  Everything was covered in some sort of sugary reduction that made the vegetables inedible, fish was way overcooked and something I ate there has upset my stomach for the past two days.  So many better dining experiences in Charlotte for comparable or better pricing and with out the pretense."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best. First bad sign was the bread. They serve their bread in a brown paper bag. It was cold and not fresh. Next was the PEI appetizer that was the next bad sign - the sauce really lacked in flavor. That was on the precursor to the main course. I went with the baked rigatoni with boar meat and mozzarella cheese. Sounded great but it was hardly that. Again, absolutely no flavor and the noodles were certainly not homemade. In my opinion, if you're going to charge $24 for a small portion of pasta it better be pretty darn good, or at the least be full of flavor. Never in my life had I had to consider putting salt on my pasta. I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and spent half the amount. Service was pretty slow, especially considering we went early and the place wasn't crowded. We will be taking are money elsewhere in the future and our search for authentic Italian continues. If you truly enjoy authentic Italian food, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous!  A few months ago we hit Good Food on Montford (also by Chef Bruce Moffett) and the experience was hip and foodie rich.  Stagioni's was also a very rich experience, but much better food wise.  The online menu is pretty accurate, but there were additional offerings presented by the waiter. Here is the rundown of our meal for 3 people: APPS: Snack Beet Bread, Prosciutto Di Parma, Bone Marrow.  MAIN: Garganelli, Cannelloni, Pizza.  DESSERT: Sorrbetto&Gellato, Zeppoli.  ALL the food was outstanding, rich in flavor, prepared and cooked to perfection - the flavors where incredible, even the pizza was packed with flavor.  Reservations are a must.  Can't wait to try Barrington's - thanks Bruce Moffett for the wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, comfy atmosphere, and great service.   For apps- the truffled cauliflower was amazing. Light, airy, savory dip- perfect with the crisp of the free accompanying chips. Another fave app was the squash blossoms. Crunchy warm slightly oily shell hiding the smooth marscapone inside. The white bean hummus and mixed olives were okay- not something Id reorder.    The pizza, like everyone says, is a must. They get the perfect amt of crispy crust and melty cheese.  The sides they offer are a great deal esp since they are huge.   Our waiter, JP, was very attentive and friendly. Their small staff really work well together- helping each other out. Another server- Wilson was great at making sure we had clean cutlery, water was filled, and that dinner went smoothly."}
{"text":"Date night after a long day at work. I really couldn't process what I wanted to order. Our waiter was like a damn food life coach. He basically ordered for me, all the way through apps to the enter. The place is absolutely 5 stars and one of the best spots CLT has to offer. If they served breakfast and I had a much larger paycheck I would eat here three (or more) times a day."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. I would've given 5 stars but for the extremely slow service. And by that I mean the kitchen, not the wait staff. Russ was as attentive and friendly as is possible on a busy Saturday night. It seemed like the kitchen was either unprepared or understaffed. That said, what finally made it to our table was worth the wait. We had the Buratta and a Ceasar salad. Both were quite good. But the Prosciutto Pizza we shared for our main was phenomenal. Interestingly enough, between the wonderful food and the quite European service, we felt like we were back in Italy!  If you want plenty of time to put down your cell phone and talk with your dinner mate, this is a great spot. If your planning a first date and allocating an hour, not so much. We like to talk to each other and we love good Italian food, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Our group has been coming to Charlotte for eleven months.  We try to eat at any restaurant that makes either a \"top\" list or is recommended to us by someone local.  To date, Stagioni is the best meal we have had.  The food was amazing.  The recommended cheese plate with pate was awesome.  The short rib was really good.  The wine pairing recommendations rounded out the meal.    Mindy rocks.  Service makes all the difference.  Mindy made great food and wine recommendations.  She checked in on us appropriately and was available when we needed it.  We would have enjoyed the dinner without Mindy, but we were glad she was there.  I am looking forward to eating there again next week."}
{"text":"What a find last night. We had a 6pm reservation and got there early so we decided to hit the bar. Jesse, the bartender was extremely knowledgable about their vast selection of wine. A member of our party who typically chooses the wine even made a comment about how helpful she was.   After drinks we made our way the the table and ordered a huge charcuterie board filled with meats and cheeses. Nothing disappointed. Next was the meatballs the Brussel sprouts pizza. I was conflicted on the pizza but soooo glad we tried it. I would easily recommended it if it's on the menu if you visit.   For mains we had a split between pastas and meats. All were amazing.   You get the idea that the food is good but I really would focus on the customer service here. The waitstaff was so accommodating and we never had to ask for anything, they were always one step ahead. The food came quick and was always hot and the staff would check on multiple occasions is the food was prepared properly and if our table required anything. For only being open 4 months, that's impressive.   Definitely check this place out. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Brought my inlaws from italy here this past friday night. They were so happy and loved it! (They are really picky when it comes to food, especially Italian). They ordered a pizza each, I got a pasta dish and my husband had fish. Everything was delicious! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Those zeppolis are a must! They are light and buttery and amazing with a salted caramel sauce. It will certainly be a repeat next time we're in."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an extreme disappointment. My husband and I have been wanting to try it since the reviews have been good and we love their sister restaurant, Good Food. It was also not easy to get a reservation last minute so we assumed a hot spot would not disappoint. The highlight of the experience was the wine. I ordered three different glasses of red and all were delicioius. Our waitress was friendly but she obviously had too many tables. The food was extremely slow from one course to the next. We waited at least 20-25 minutes between our appetizer and entree. We ordered the stuffed peppers as a snack. They were edible but nothing special, we wouldn't order them again. I had the pumpkin soup as my appetizer and my husband had the fig tart special. The pumpkin soup was good but I expected it to be thicker and more hearty. The fig tart was o.k. but heavy for an appetizer and over-priced. My husband ordered the $30 pasta entree special with truffle mushrooms. In the 4 years we've been dining together, we have never sent an entree back to the kitchen. This was an exception. The pasta literally had zero flavor. It tasted like noodles with a little butter that you would serve to a 5 year old. The waitress happily switched his dish for the rigatoni, which was just as bad. The pasta was cooked just fine but the small amount of sauce served over the dish was watery and flavorless. I ordered the trout. It lacked flavor and the portion was definitley small for the price. All in all I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 10 based on the wine. $150 and we left still hungry. We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Husband and enjoyed our dinner here the other week. He enjoyed his pork chop, and I really enjoyed my duck.  Everything was phenomenal.  Definitely a place worth a splurge."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Good Food on Montford (same people behind Stagioni and Barrington's) you must, must, must try Stagioni.  (The name, BTW, means 4 seasons.)  Farm-centric, in-house everything.  Well executed and balanced and the service really knows the menu.   To give you an idea of what we ate...er, what DIDN'T we eat?  4 of us got about 15 dishes to share, and every bite was excellent.   Standouts: Housemade ricotta. Cauliflower truffle spread.  Chicken skins.  (Which taste real meaty and delicious.  They actually ran out the night we dined b/c they're so popular.) Grilled octopus (oh man, the sauce...we lapped up the sauce long after the tentacles were all gone...) agnolotti (all homemade pastas...as they should be) and this crazy delicious parsnip puree and brussels sprout pizza. Oh, and the dessert zeppoli are possibly the lightest, most addicting melt-in-your-mouth delicious way to end a meal.    PS:  Take note of the cool decor, including the fake-out bookshelf that's really a door.  Also, they've got prosecco on tap (how cool!?) and their pear cocktail is simply light and sweet and smooth.    PPS: The dress-up scale on this place is about the same as GF.  You could wear a suit, or wear jeans and a button up and be perfectly comfortable."}
{"text":"Stagioni's has quickly became my wife and I's favorite Italian Eatery in Charlotte, hands down.   Andrew Dodd, has built a extremely well executed menu + cool an calm open Kitchen which delivers classic, seasonal dishes that leave you amazed and satisfied.  We have attended this restaurant three times with each time being more and more enjoyable. We attended Staginoi's first on Christmas Eve and we were able to speak with Andrew Dodd quite a bit. He is extremely knowledgable of his local purveyor's and passionate about his food.   Hand made pastas, sausages, and well balanced entrees leveraging a High Heat Brick Oven and fun staff.   Check this place out, you will not be disappointed. Hoping for a summer filled with Seafood as Dodd is very focused on maintaining his seasonal approach!   We Will Be Back Soon"}
{"text":"This was a first for me and I was very pleased. We started our evening at the bar with well made drinks, he did not skimp ;). We were seated shortly after our reservation time of 7:45 (New Years Eve so I can understand that). Our pre Appetizers were sumptuous truffle balls which filled the restaurant with a lush rich aroma. The garden fresh salad with candied pork belly was amazing! I chose the Carolina grouper and the Chocolate dessert. There are just no words for the dessert! It was delicious!!!! Our waiter was a lot of fun and we really enjoyed our first experience here. Our holiday visit was a memorable one ;)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Myers Park located in a very old European feeling villa. We have lived in CLT for years but never noticed this place tucked away. We really liked the bar, rustic / old world vibe.  Great bar tenders (Russ).   Had a variety of small plates and a  pizza, all were excellent and very unique.  Our fav was the butternut squash.  Prices were very fair.  Overall, one of our best recent meals and dining experiences. Only complaint was hostess. Made reservations for our anniversary and reminded her on arrival. She sat us at a tiny 2 top (dining room was empty).  When we asked for a larger table, she refused and told us that they were for \"reservations\" (which we had).  Dining room remained half full entire night. Glad we sat in bar."}
{"text":"What do you do when you're the creative mind behind two of Charlotte's most celebrated restaurants and the winner of multiple awards? Thats right... you open another one. Bruce Moffett (the man behind Barrington's and Good Food on Montford) is a James Beard nominated chef, was named \"Restaurateur of the Year\" by Charlotte Magazine, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America with Honors, and has worked at L'Espalier and Metropolis Caf√©. Before becoming one of Charlotte's most well known chefs, Bruce Moffett graduated from the University of Rhode Island for Political Science, moved to Washington, DC and spent six years working for US Senator John Chafee. Now he's opened Stagioni and the anticipation has been steadily growing since it was announced.  Stagioni is set in the Historic Reynolds-Gourmajenko in Charlotte's prestigious Myers Park neighborhood. The building... wait... let me correct... the Mansion was Charlotte's first Tuscan Villa, it featured a Mediterranean inspired walled courtyard and its roof is made of antique cuban tiles. The setting gets a huge A+ from us and its easily one of the most beautiful restaurants we've ever seen... until you get inside.  The inside is suppose to be a take on Italian elegance that pays homage to the homes history. Most of the interior decor was on point (especially the open kitchen design) but we've got to call them out on all of the \"red touches\" placed throughout. The red doesn't look elegant... it looks like something better suited in a $20 brothel. There are red glass votive candle holders on the table, red sconces on the wall, red lamps in the kitchen, etc... and they need to go. Its not so much the design as it is the color. If they were perhaps a little more Mediterranean and a lot less Ferrari I think they would be perfect. Maybe one of the colors from Design Seeds?  With that rant out of the way we can get back to business.  Once seated we were attentively waited on by the staff and after a quick look at the menu we were ready to get our grub on. I'm (Curtis) not usually very adventurous when it comes to trying foods from the weird category, especially weird seafood. But on this night I was feeling pretty damn frisky so I kicked off the night by trying the Grilled Octopus with Pickled Onion, Olive Oil, and Lemon. Ella played it safe and ordered the Arancini aka Stuffed Risotto Balls (theres nothing we like more than cheese stuffed fried balls).   The octopus was plated beautifully and all of the accompaniments were seriously on point. As far as the octopus goes, well it was my first tangle with the eight legged sea creature and I didn't hate it at all. It reminded me a lot of shrimp, a little chewy like a bouncy ball, a little weird, and not anything I think I will be craving late at night. Ella's stuffed balls were easily the favorite antipasto and we could have made a meal of just balls if we had order more.   For our entrees we both stuck to our favorites and I got the Steak Florentine with Spinach, Garlic, Lemon, and a side of Polenta. Ella got the Gnocchi with Mushrooms, Peas, Prosciutto, and cream. To be completely honest I was pretty disappointed in my steak. It didn't come out medium-rare, it tasted as plain as a piece of meat could taste, and when compared to e2 Emeril's Eatery 16oz Painted Hills Rib Eye served with a salad of arugula, fennel, oven dried tomato and housemade worcestershire sauce... it just seems like a waste of money and steak. Instead of going for the spinach I spent my time savoring Stagioni's creamy polenta, it needed some cheese but it was still one of my favorite dishes of the night.   Ella ultimately decided to go with the gnocchi because she has had it several times at Good Food on Montford and thoroughly enjoyed it. She was pleased to see that the recipe had not changed. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and paired perfectly with the sweet peas and salty prosciutto.  No night is complete without dessert so we flagged down our server and after a couple seconds we placed our dessert order. I decided I might have better luck trying something weird than sticking with something safe so I went for the pear skillet cake served with caramel sauce, whipped cream and avocado ice cream. I was really exited to try the avocado ice cream, but found myself disappointed. I missed the avocado flavor completely and in the end it was really just green vanilla ice cream. The cake had a really nice texture and good flavor, I just wish it had more pears.   Ella got the apricot panna cotta served with dried cherries  and a pistachio cookie (I ended up with dessert envy). The panna cotta was perfectly smooth, rich and flavorful. The accompaniments worked perfectly with the dessert adding crunch from the cookie and a sweet sourness from the cherries.  Stagioni was mostly a great restaurant and perhaps with more time it will match the level of Bruce's other creations."}
{"text":"I had high expectation on this place since it is in the same group with Good Food Montford and they did not disappoint me. My wife and I started with the grilled octopus and it was grilled to perfection. Then, we shared the shrimp spaghetti and Brussels sprouts pizza. The spaghetti was cooked al dente to my liking. The shrimps might be able to use a little bit more of seasoning. The oven baked pizza has a great crust and taste. We will definitely go back to this place again. I would have given this place 5 star if it were not for the bad acoustic in the main dining area. It was hard to carry a conversation with a person across the table."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner...incredible homemade pasta....wonderful starters....fantastic service. We were there the 1st Sat. Night after opening & everything went perfectly. Stagioni is just beautiful...perfect atmosphere. Love that they take dinner reservations. Another wonderful addition to the growing Charlotte restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"I went with my parents (my 2nd time eating here) and we decided to eat at the bar because of the wait. The girl bartender with an excessively large bun on her head was incredibly rude and condescending. She seemed annoyed that we were there and tried to rush us so she could have more customers. It was literally the worst customer service I've ever received. Also, the menu and food is subpar and definitely not worth the prices nor the attitude from the bartender. I will never go back here!!"}
{"text":"Bar hopping for Tapas tonight. 4th stop of the evening. Fabulous mussels! Unexpected cream broth with a wonderful flavor. Tega Hills salad was fabulous. Place was packed. Reservation are probably a must, but we sat right down at the bar and ordered. Servers are super friendly and we'll trained on their product. We will be back for a full reservation in the near future."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in Charlotte in a long time. I started off with the Arancini and it was really good. Wish it would have had a little more cheese, but it was still very good. Then had the Farfalle for my entree. It was made to perfection. The pasta, shrimp, and broth it was served in was amazing. It was a light pasta dish that didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed after eating it. Then for dessert I had the cannoli and it was served with pistachio ice cream. That was delicious as well.   Just a few suggestions:  1) wish the cocktail list had a few more choices 2) the wine list needs some details about the wines so customers can make a better choice. I love trying new wines, but stuck to the pinot grigio as I didn't know what any of the others were or what they may be like. 3) we had a reservation, but did not get seated until 20+ mins after that reservation time.   4) light fixture in the bathroom looks super cheap compared to the overall restaurant. Noticed the lights seem to be from Target and are usually found outside over a patio with a plug on the end to use for the next strand.   All-in-all, I highly suggest trying this place. The food was amazing and the restaurant, outside and in, is beautiful."}
{"text":"We have been to Stagioni several times and the food is always wonderful.  The seasonal menus offer a wide variety of choices whether you want a full meal or small plates. We brought my parents for dinner a few weeks ago and decided we had to go back for date night before they changed the menu so we could try a few more things. The brussel sprout pizza was delicious!!  We also lucked out on our last two visits to have Jenny as our server.  She is friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and wine list!  Definitely make time to visit this Myers Park gem!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday evening with some coworkers.  We were from out of town so I wasn't sure what to expect. The decor is great, wonderful atmosphere, but the standout was the food. From the complimentary house made bread, to dessert that I will always remember, Stagioni does not disappoint.Be sure to try the duck, the arancini, the grilled octopus, and top it off with tasty Affogato that comes with more cookies than you need after such a big meal. I am sure that I will be back again on my next visit to Charlotte.  Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding Lamb Cannelloni & Chicken Rigatoni! Rich complex gravies are amazing- and the antipasti with house made ricotta & other exceptional offering are so great!!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the the owner for bringin' in an amazing new Chef! One of the most romantic compliments someone can get, is when another person sees a picture and simply states: There are no words. This food is like that.   Of course, I'll find some words, or else this would be a pointless review, right? And oh my, will there be words. I'm about to do some ramblin'!  We'll start with the starters. From their antipasto menu, we were blessed with the flavors of the Caprese and the Italian Sausage Crustini. Now, I have had my fair share of \"caprese salads\" as I love fresh mozzarella. But this was not only visually beautiful, but absolute flavor perfection. There were several varieties of tomatoes, each with their own flavor notes along with the perfect vinaigrette that was poignantly sweet and tart. This was all accented with mozzarella foam. Now, anything with the word 'foam' usually turns me off, as I'm not a gastro-food pro, however, this was exactly what this antipasto needed. Anything more would have thrown off the balance of this exquisite salad.  The Italian Sausage Crustini came out, and we thought of some sort of dank hot dog, however we were more than pleasantly surprised. The bread was light and fluffy and the sausage was not overpowering or heavy, but had the slightest hint of heat and pepper, all accented with a lovely sweet pepper sauce (which has a fancier name, but I can't remember it just now) that tied everything into a taste bud orgasm.  We also were honored with two specials for the evening, which may not be available for you when you go, and you should feel sad if they aren't. Fried squash blossoms stuffed with mascarpone and heaven, and a gazpacho that would rival a fine wine as it had notes of cucumber, melon and summer.  We decided on pasta entrees as we'd heard that the pasta is made in-house (and it's an Italian place). We had Agnolotti and the Spaghetti. Though I've never been to Italy, these entrees made me think that this is what I would be eating while dining on some patio overlooking the sea. Pasta that wasn't overloaded and heavy, but simply made you joyous while you chewed. The Spaghetti was served with little neck clams in a light angelic white wine sauce, and the Agnolotti? Oh. My. God. I am often wary of lobster, as so many chefs choose to use it, and so many chefs send out lobster that's rubbery and chewy. This lobster melted in my mouth. And the pasta was stuffed with, hold onto your seats folks, this amazing corn concoction...and I believe crack. Because I couldn't stop eating it. I was SO full, but my fork just kept moving because it was the perfect sweetness to go with the lobster, all in a light sauce that held the perfect hint of saltiness to blend the flavors into...well, that crack concoction I was referring to.  We didn't need dessert. We truly didn't, however the Zeppoli was 'forced' upon us, and we grudgingly acquiesced knowing at this point, that it would be amazing. And we were not disappointed. Light clouds of fried bread dusted with powdered sugar with a semi-sweet caramel dipping sauce. And...for once,...I simply don't have the words. When thinking about it, I just smile.  Everything we ate made us make noises that bordered on sexual bliss. I hate to call myself a \"foodie\" because I hate those people, but I eat a lot of good food in a lot of good restaurants, but this was simply a treat for our taste buds. And the service needs to be mentioned, as it was impeccable (ask for Jack). No empty plate lingered on our table, nor were we ever lacking anything, and he 'touched' the table with perfect timing. If you like to eat wonderfulness, and simply going to a place that's going to leave you longing for more, than this is definitely the place for you.  Bravo Chef Dodd! Well done. Very, very well done."}
{"text":"I can not say enough Good Things about Stagioni's from the moment I walked in I felt welcome! We were Warmly Greeted by the Manger and we were seated immediately. The Staff came over to our table immediately and served us water and warm bread while we looked over the menus.  The Decor puts you in the mind of Tuscany and is very appeasing to the eye. The intricate details gives your eye something new to explore at all times.  The Kitchen is open to the restaurant so you are able to get a peak at all of the delicious food that is coming out! The best thing about all the pastas and breads are that they are made in house!  Being that I was with a Group of Friends we decided to order an array of different dishes and drinks to do tastings. We order the Meatball Pizza, Rigatoni, Steak Florentine, and my all time favorite the Mushroom Risotto!! It was so good! We topped everything off with the tiramisu cheesecake it will not disappoint!!!   I would say this is a Great Place for Date Night and socializing with friends! Be sure to make reservations early this place fills up quick."}
{"text":"Every.simgle.dish  GREAT Everything was just excellent, really excellent, includimg Kelly, our server (who recommended 2 great wines and a number of the dishes below and served them at exactly the right place)  I don't know how you can execute so many courses at that high level for a restaurant full of people.  Appetizer was a think sliced veal with tuna caper sauce, then sweet potato cavatelli, truffle pizza, shaved asparagus , risotto cake (crispy and delicious), fried cauliflower, and dessert (zeppoli) the lightest and most delicious fried dough (that description doesn't do it justice - beignet  like but lighter) with salted homemade caramel sauce - an amazing evening with a this meal as the centerpiece!"}
{"text":"Neat place! Surprisingly good, but probably won't be back. It didn't really have enough variety for me.   Beth our waitress was very nice!  Hendrick gin a tonic's- excellently made! $14   I ordered the Angel hair pasta with fettuccini Alfredo- Absolutely wonderful sauce!!!! The pasta was pretty well done. I would have made this a regular place with different noodles. Andrew Dod, the chef, whipped up the sauce just for me! Incredible!! 5 stars to him. $15  Broccoli- was delicious, but some were charred heavily.  This gave it a crunchy dead dry taste. I picked around for the less done ones, and they were fabulous!  I specifically asked the waitress and she said there was nothing burnt about it, not so much! $6  My friend ordered the lobster gnocchi and she liked it, but the plate was tiny.  $30  $96 total"}
{"text":"I went once and enjoyed the atmosphere and food so much I decided to bring back my Executive Staff. Not only was it as great the second time, but the people were even better. I really like this place, wish it was in Dallas so I could be a regular. If you're in Charlotte this place is a must."}
{"text":"Grilled octopus is soft and tasty. However it has a rather strong fishy smell. The spaghetti with shrimp dish is excellent. The pasta is fresh and cooked perfectly al dente. The brick oven pizza with prosciutto and brussel sprouts are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Xmas party.  Took about 10 minutes to get my first glass of wine and waiting over 15 for a refill.  The appetizers were very messy and just okay.  The fish entree was good, but such a small portion that I went home and ate again.  I'm pretty small and normally have leftovers.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and delicious food!! Exactly what I would expect from another Moffet restaurant.  The breadsticks and bread were delicious!! We shared small dishes including truffle eggs, cauliflower, and warm ricotta; followed by meats and cheeses, meatball sandwich and brussels sprout pizza. Zeppoli, fried pillows  of heaven, for dessert were delicious!! Even the cocktails were great!! Next time I'll start on page two of the menu and try pasta and main entrees. No doubt they'll be delicious!!"}
{"text":"We had family dinner there, and while it's a noisy atmosphere--the food is divine. The bar area is very crowded on most nights so pretend it's a NYC place. We made reservations as I strongly recommend for anyone dining.  My favorite was the farfalle pasta with pistachios, shrimp and saffron. The app of Brussels sprouts and parsnip pur√©e pizza was incredible my delicious. I have found a new favorite dinner destination."}
{"text":"We had an amazing night out for my friends birthday dinner!   Everyone was fantastic! I loved the setup of this place! It's small and intimate with an open kitchen! I loved being able to watch my food being prepared!   We started with the Stagioni Charcuterie appetizer plate, I don't remember everything that was on it but it was ALL delicious! And those rolls....WOWsers. Warm little heavenly goodness. Oh yeah and they are freshly made in house....yeah, they're cool like that.   After that we ordered the Tartufi pizza which comes with caramelized onions, fontina, arugula and truffle oil. Shut up!!! That was one of the BEST pizzas I've ever had. It was probably the truffle oil...or the crust but either way....when I go back (and I will definitely be going back) I'll be getting this again! Yum.   For dinner everyone tried something different, I ordered the risotto, but was also able to tasted the rigatoni, and the agnolotti! Yum. Yum. Yum. All the dishes were delish!   The menu changes often so it will always be something worth trying here! I'm sure you can tell...but I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"A cozy place for dinner. Liked all the appetizers we ordered: grilled romaine salad, meatball and PEI mussel. The entree though, was a little disappointing - the poussin was fried too firm and had no flavor what so ever..."}
{"text":"Started with some cocktails,  we ordered 2 from the seasonal menu and they were a treat, one was served with shave ice and a pinwheel the other with a popsicle in the drink - they were DELICIOUS! The trout, the squash, the beet grapefruit ravioli and the corn soup were out of this world good. One of the best meals I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Stagioni has become one of my favorite, go-to restaurants in Charlotte. I love the seasonal menu and their new, innovative offerings every few months! Their food is reasonably priced - while entrees range from $25-$35, they also have lower priced options like pizzas and pastas.   If you order anything, order the duck. Every seasonal iteration I've tasted has been supremely delicious, to the point where I can't bring myself to order anything else. It is always perfectly prepared and complemented by the rest of the dish. Last night it included multi-grain risotto and duck confit - so delicious I would have just ordered that on its own!   Perfect for date night or a low key work dinner, Stagioni is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday in August, and I'm glad I finally tried it out.  The lobster gnocchi was good, though I was a bit disappointed with the serving size- I knew I wouldn't get a ton of lobster, but I was hopping for more gnocchi.  My girlfriend got the lamb rigatoni, which was amazing!  So freaking good, I would recommend it for anyone.  The atmosphere of the place is nice, but it got really loud in there as dinner progressed- guess it's just a small place that everything echoes.  Service was decent, but our server vanished in the middle of the meal; fortunately, nothing was wrong with our dishes, but I feel like it's standard for someone to stop by and check.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Stagioni, but maybe recommend that you try it during the week when it might be a bit quieter."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. It's somewhat pricey but everything is good.  I consistently love the pizza... best in Charlotte. Casual atmosphere is great. Despite the bad weather this weekend they were open and ready to serve. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We were a party of four, and we dine out together at least twice month. I thought I would surprise everyone with a new restaurant. Since Stagioni was owned by the owners of Barringtons (one of our favorites), I thought we would give Stagioni a shot. Where do I begin.... A. We were seated by the ladies room and a steel exterior door. We were all freezing.  B. I asked about the Calamari, and they said it was stuffed with ham and that's the way they do it. I asked if they could leave out the ham, and the waitress said no. Not a red meat eater I passed.  C. The portions were very very small, served on a large plates. 2 of our dishes were cold. The order  Rigatoni was undercooked. Both were sent back. The duck was tasteless and the rigatoni was still undercooked and only warm. D. We were charged different prices on the wine when we asked for refills. E. They actually deducted 2 of the entree's and the bill was still $124. F. The glasses of wine were barely filled... and at $13 a glass. Now, I don't care about the money if the food is good, but this was a disgrace. Since I selected the restaurant, you can imagine my embarrassment.  As I told my guests...\"It's only a mistake if you do it twice\".   We will not come back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Would definitely recommend as a date spot."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte since moving here last year.  Beats Intermezzos, Pizza Peel and Hawthorne's easily. Great zesty sauce.  Quality ingredients. Awesome crust.  Cool atmosphere. Yum."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice and both times I had excellent service and I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu.  I love that they have seasonal items and that they have unique items on their menu."}
{"text":"Meh. Underwhelming food in a nice atmosphere and good service. Portions are small and menu is overly complicated. Not a bad place but there are better options."}
{"text":"Ah, what to say about Stagioni? I can preface my review by saying that I am not usually a fan of Italian food, or more precisely the same old tired Italian food. Looking at the menu before making a reservation, I was already salivating and torn on what to order. My friend had already been there for drinks and suggested that we park out back, because the majority of the parking is out back off Fenton Place with only a few spots out front on Providence.  We were greeted warmly and sat immediately in front of the open kitchen. There are even 6-8 seats with a closer view of the kitchen in a straight bar type set up. Our server was on the spot to take drink orders, drop off bread and go over the menu with the group, including specials. I was expecting a slightly larger dining area and a more formal dress, but neither was the case and also neither was a problem. As the evening went on, there seemed to be a more formal dressed crowd, but overall it was a relaxed atmosphere and the dining room did not feel cramped.  Now onto the food, we started with some sputini or snacks which in this case were small portions to share. The group of four chose 5 different options to include chicken skin, truffled cauliflower, pickled veggies, house made ricotta and mortadella mousse. My standout was the mortadella mousse, just imagine spreadable mortadella. No one really liked the chicken skins as they were not really seasoned, even the person that really wanted to order them was disappointed. They weren't bad tasting but just under seasoned. The other 3 were great and very flavorful. When the snacks arrived, I ask our server for the clam and mussel pizza for the table to share, as I had forgot to order it the first go around. It came out quickly and it was pipping hot. It also came with a pair of pizza scissors for me to use. Well there is a first time for everything and they worked great to cut the pizza. The pizza had cauliflower pur√©e as the sauce and topped with bacon and the aforementioned clams and mussels. It was delicious and I can easily see coming here just for drinks and their inventive pizzas.  On to the mains, 2 people, including myself had the grouper special which came with ramps and a ramp pesto. The fish was cooked to perfection and all the flavors blended together well. The other 2 diners, including the wife chose some house made pastas. Now the fish was good, but the pastas were out of this world good. It brought me back to my first trip to Italy over 20 years ago. Needless to say that next time, I am getting a pasta dish for my main. The pastas chosen were the rigatoni and triangle shaped goat cheese stuffed ravioli. For dessert, we went with buffet and by that I mean that we all chose one and we all shared. The cannoli were great in my mind as well as the raspberry gelato and pistachio gelato. The pear skillet cake was just alright and for me the zeppoli were not my thing, but everyone else at the table loved them. I think that they are just not in my flavor profile.  If you are wondering what we had to drink, nothing really stood out as far as the cocktails that we had. They have an extensive wine list that may be your best bet. I did find that the cocktails and deserts were a little pricy compared to the food. Either way, the food was fantastic overall and maybe we will try some wine next time. The few minor things that weren't perfect like the chicken skin and cocktails don't take away from a 5 star experience and I look forward to an evolving seasonal menu. After all, stagioni means season in Italian and I will hold them to that. It could also mean not the same old tired Italian food as well."}
{"text":"Really great date night restaurant. I love that everything is local and seasonal. The pork shoulder is delicious.   I've heard that the lobster mac n cheese is good but felt sick after trying it myself.   Great customer service, will definitely return and try some other items, maybe not yhe seafood though."}
{"text":"Took a group of girlfriends last night and as usual, our experience was incredible.  If you want pockets of heaven, order the (current menu) first primi pasta which is homemade pasta stuffed with a triple cream type of cheese.  Outstanding!  The barrel aged risotto with the halibut was excellent also.  None of had pizza last night but I recently tried the broccoli pizza and it was fantastic.  The Blanche cocktail is excellent too.  Russ, the bartender, knows his cocktails...and his customer....we thank him for enjoying us!  And thank you, chef Drew for your team's outstanding creations!"}
{"text":"The Moffett Bros. just get me. Everything they do is amazing.   I walked in here with my wife on Valentine's day with no reservation and was lucky enough to get a table near the bar.   Decor- Beautiful, simple, and rustic.(pretty much describes it all)  Apps- Olives and stuffed peppadew were both delicious. I am a huge fan of table olives.  Pizza- cheese and sauce were good but the real star of the show was the crust/dough.   Mains- We had the Fettuccini and Porchetta and the fettuccini was really a standout..   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sooo we had apps and drinks at Stagioni.  It was awesome!   Service was prompt, the prosciutto and leek pizza was fresh and delish, and the waiter was very knowledgeable and on point.  I definitely recommend and plan to return. ;)"}
{"text":"Have been back 3 times since my first review and I have to say that I've been disappointed. The food and service really lacked. Don't know what happened??"}
{"text":"Always a lovely place to be with friends! From the person that takes reservations to the bartender to the wait staff to the chef, this place impresses me every single time!! They are always willing to accommodate my obscene obsession for the polenta, even special making it or creating a dish to accommodate my request. I have NEVER had a single item that wasn't amazing. It feels like a warm hug on a cold night:)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I consider myself a pizza aficionado. I have tried my fair share of pies, but after trying this place last night, my husband and I have a new favorite. The sauce is incredible- sweet, and very tomato-y. The crust is perfect although very thin in the middle so if you like thick crust this may not be for you. The sausage was very flavorful as well and we highly recommend the pepperoni and sausage pie if you like meat. We liked the pizza so much we got a second one to take home. As for the rest...the atmosphere is cozy and romantic, the perfect place for a special occasion. We also tried the meatballs which were delicious with another delicious marinara sauce. I'm telling you, you could eat a bowl of the sauces at this place and be quite happy with your meal. Make sure to make a reservation as this place is small. Overall, a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and ambiance is wonderful. ! The tartuffi pizza was great, as we're the gnocchi and squabs dishes. The zeppolis are amazing too. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A fantastic experience from service to food.   Situated in a historic old Charlottean mini-mansion, you'll find Stagioni. This place doesn't disappoint at all. After several visits here, it is absolutely one of the best spots in Charlotte that you don't ever hear anyone talk about.   Stagioni is a really nice hybrid of fine and semi-casual dining. They have found this balance that says \"we are a nice restaurant, but most importantly we care about the food we serve\". This is the first restaurant that has offered a fine dining experience, but also doubled as my casual go-to spot for delicious pizza and beer. The inside offers a quaint, intimate, and darker setting that will absolutely be the highlight of your evening out.   The appetizers are delicious as are the main pasta dishes. You can't go wrong with anything seafood-based here. Even the table bread and rosemary olive oil are phenomenal. The drink selection is interesting without being too fussy. They offer some craft cocktails, good wine, and good draft beers.  Now, it's time to talk about the pizza. This is the best pizza in Charlotte. Whether you're a deep dish, NY style, or Neapolitan style fan, you will quickly fall in love with Stagioni's pizza. It's thin, with the right amount of soft and crunchy. The toppings, the cheese, the sauce...it's incredible. It's also the first time I have ever been given scissors to cut a pizza, which is actually quite efficient.    You owe it to yourself to try this place. Restaurants like these are holding up the food and restaurant reputation for Charlotte. Without a doubt, an unwavering 5/5."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Our meals and server (stefanie) were amazing!! Truffle tagliatelle and the NY strip. Prepared great and the desserts were amazing!! Zeppoli was as advertised and the gelato was smooth and delicious.  Definitely a repeat restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for dinner on our anniversary and it was definitely the right choice!  I loved the romantic atmosphere and we had great service from the minute we walked in the door.  While everything we ordered was delicious, the best part of our meal was the charcuterie plate.  It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Visited Stagioni as a group of  8 on July 4 weekend. I'm not well versed in the Charlotte restaurant scene, but we had a great experience here.   We had an 830 reservation and were seated right away in a corner in the back dining room. The exterior of the building is very Tuscan, but inside the vibe was trendy and cozy - Dark(but not too dark), Rustic(with a touch of industrial), and bustling(but not too loud). The dining room was full but we could still hear each other speaking at a normal volume.   All of the food we ate was excellent - as a table we sampled the meatballs, charcuterie, grilled octopus, and a margherita pizza. The octopus left a little to be desired - it was slightly tough and a touch under seasoned, but Stagioni gets a pass since every other dish was a home run. Dinner for me was the truffle pasta, which was out of this world. I also appreciated that the portions were generous, but not enormous. We left satisfied but not feeling gross. Several of our dates had the Pork Chop and all agreed it was outrageous. We ordered one dessert (coconut panna cotta) and it was good - a little tart for most of our tastes, but a generous portion and nice execution (served in a stemless wine glass).   On top of the food, the service was attentive but not annoying. Our waitress knew the menu inside and out and was thorough in guiding us through the meal. I cannot comment on the drink list as we had decided previously that we would share the sparkling rose for dinner, but one of my dinner companions did have a cocktail that she thought was lovely.   I would definitely recommend this spot for bigger groups (with a reservation of course). There is also an outdoor patio / bar in the back of the restaurant that we did not get to enjoy on account of some unexpected rain. Looking forward to checking it out next time we are in town."}
{"text":"30$ and a drive down providence road will allow anyone to take a little (and I mean super tiny) trip to Europe and back. Stagioni is located in the cutest flat building that contains concrete columned walkways with intentionally chipped paint.  I just wish there were more nighttime things to do here because it would be the perfect romantic date spot.   As for the inside, the best description I can think of is \"upscale hipster\". The decorations are cozy with mixes between metals and wood, the light is dim, and most impressively: every single waiter had on a chambray shirt and nicely groomed beards. Props to Stagioni for finding these gentlemen with such hair growing talents.    The food was awesome. From appetizer to dessert, I couldn't stop myself from chowing down everything in front of me.  The menu changes but as of now, I'd recommend mussels for appetizer and short rib for entree. Let me tell you, those mussels are expensive but well damn worth that price tag.  But honestly in general Stagioni isn't unaffordable. We paid 80$ for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and dessert. And we left completely stuffed like two turkeys on Thanksgiving.   Lastly, don't expect parking unless you come early (like 6ish). The lot is small and spots are very limited, especially when it's busy."}
{"text":"To commemorate our 3rd wedding anniversary, we planned to go to this $$$ rated Stagioni !  The FOOD cannot go wrong here, definitely a $$$ quality, taste and presentation.  Loved it.  But the restaurant's ambience, seating, serving, space between tables, noise, etc. definitely not a $$$ experience, but again we would definitely go back for the food but may be with a more casual dressing lol. We initially thought of ordering some wine, but the jolly atmosphere made us opt for beers ;) started off with some nice Belgium ales and Charred Octopus as an appetizer.  Loved the octopus - it was cooked in their oven (used to bake pizza) and the char was perfect and crispy on the outside.  We also got some complimentary bread and bread sticks in a paper bag (weird ?!?) rather than getting them served on a plate. Our server was very good - polite, knowledgeable, explained everything in detail and made sure we were doing fine all the time.  We were told if we could give all the order at one time, it would be easier for the chef and get it done on time and quick. Ordered Baked Rigatoni and Quail for the main course - both were outstanding.  Baked Rigatoni had baked rabbit as the meat and it was perfectly cooked and rigatoni was just delicious.  Fried quail legs - was very tasty and the puree on the plate was extremely delicious, had to order a side of angles hair since just the fried quail legs were more like a finger food for me lol. BEST PART - The dessert - Zeppoli and Warm Torta. If you looked up yelp before going to Stagioni, you would know you \"have\" to try Zeppoli.  As rightly described those ARE pillows of heaven.  Similar to beignets only more softer and tastier with salted caramel sauce on the side (damnnnnnnnn).  The lady of the couple sitting in our adjacent table couldn't resist the sweet aroma of these Zeppoli and asked us what that was, ROFL. Warm Torta was just out of the world - chocolate cake, crumbly on the outside and gooey inside with vanilla icecream or gelato on top.  the candied sweet potatoes are the show stealer of this dessert. Loved the FOOD, loved the service !"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat if you want an out of the way, non-name brand Italian food place.  I had a Tega salad which was very good, the Chicken 2 ways (fried and baked) and the orange rice pudding dessert.  It was all very good.  The service was exceptional and always there when we needed it.  My business partner had the Trout and his looked very good as well.  We both had a coffee before we left and it was all pretty good."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite place in Charlotte. I love that the menu changes, everything is fresh and made perfectly, and it's nice and cozy inside. I hate big, loud restaurants. This place is comfortable and intimate."}
{"text":"Stagioni has good Italian food and a great wine selection. The menu is ever-changing which I like - you can order something different every time you go! We ordered the squash blossoms to start which were crispy and delicious. The pasta entrees were the perfect portion but a bit over-salted."}
{"text":"OMG. Wher have you been hiding Stagioni? Ever changing beautiful menu. Wow, wow, wow. I had a gnocchi made to order that was better than I had in Rome. For dessert I had a homemade cannoli. I just about died. It was perfect and light and crisp and thin the way it's supposed to be. So going back!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to try Stagioni on one of the \"Friends and Family\" opening nights and I liked it so much that I went back 2 nights later!  In fact I was scoping out the menu on that first night and figuring out that whatever we didn't order that night I would just get on my next trip in.  For me there was never a question of not liking this place, Barrington's and Good Food are my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and I knew this place was going to be on par, if not better because its Italian and I LOVE Italian food!!  The design really is beautiful, from the floors, to the bathroom chandelier, to the cool picture spread out over the dining room ceiling, you can tell a lot of work went into making this place look good.  But the most important part, the food and drinks!  I have only had beer and wine so far, prosecco on tap, how cool is that??  I like that there is a whole section of spreads, my favorite was the ricotta, I could have licked the bowl clean but that would have been inappropriate so I stopped myself.  The red pepper and truffled cauliflower are good too, but the ricotta is just so creamy and light.    Arancini were delish, but how can you mess up fried balls of rice?  The braciole was another standout, as was the meatball pizza, the brodetto and the fettuccine.  But my new favorite thing in the whole world is the stracci, seriously I have been telling anyone who will listen to order this dish.  It was homemade ribbon pasta, huge shrimp, and pistachios in a light tomato saffron broth.  It was so amazing we were all fighting over who got to finish this dish.  I know I am missing some things but I am sure you get the point, pretty much everything its delicious.  Finally, dessert.  They have the pear skillet cake on their menu that Good Food used to have, its served with avocado ice cream and some salted caramel and its truly one of the most unique and delicious desserts I've ever eaten.  I was so sad when GF took it off their menu so I was very happy to see it here.  I also tried the zeppoli's and they were different than other zeppoli's I have had, much lighter so I almost felt like I was being healthy (haha) but still very good.  Overall, I was very impressed with Stagioni.  Usually when a restaurant is brand new you expect to have a lot of issues with food and service but I had 2 great experiences and plan on going back again this week, I mean a girl can only go so long without her stracci!!"}
{"text":"Three of us tried to go here last night for a birthday celebration. I made reservations via phone earlier in the week. My friend arrived early to check-in. They denied our reservation, and the hostess was extremely rude. Another friend that was with us said a similar thing happened to her a few weeks earlier when she tried to go with a group of 5 for another bday party.  This type of behavior is completely unacceptable especially for a restaurant/restaurant group of this caliber. If you don't want to take reservations, then fine, but it's poor business to allow patrons to plan a night to fail at your expense.  If you do mess up a reservation, then try to accommodate the customer rather than treating them like they are at fault.  Needless to say, none of my friends will ever be trying this restaurant.  There are too many good restaurants with good customer service to deal with this treatment."}
{"text":"How lucky am I that my sister-in-law chose this for our dinner spot on my way-too-short visit to Charlotte!  A perfect atmosphere, intimate and cozy, with an open kitchen, which is where we chose to sit to watch the staff work their brilliance.  We started with the Tartufi pizza which comes with caramelized onions, fontina, arugula and truffle oil. It was to die for. Then followed it up with the Carbonara - I have no words.  The staff was informative, and friendly - Even the company around us. Everyone seemd delighted, and I thoroughly enjoyed catching that occasional \"yeah, we know what's up\", satisfied glance.  Highly recommended, and I think the perfect date place! Bravo Stagioni."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the sat us 45 minutes after our reservation. Management made it right by comping our drinks, as they should have. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner!  We had the mussels and Tega Hill salad to start, the NC Trout and chicken cacciatore for entrees and the zeppolis for dessert.  All were delicious and more than enough food.  Great service and ambiance as well.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our cheese plate was OK I've had better.  My steak was Divine, the pork shoulder was delicious, and the shrimp carbonara was perfect.  With all that praise the dessert was the best, the Zeppole with salted Carmel sauce!!! I look forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying Stagioni since they opened, so maybe my expectations were too high? They called to confirm our Saturday at 7:00 p.m. reservation earlier in the day, and when we arrived, there was no one at the hostess stand. We waited... and waited... and waited. Finally, a random waiter came over to greet us. He grabbed menus, told us to follow him, and walked into the dining room... where he promptly turned around to tell us our table wasn't ready yet. So, back into the bar we walked. We grabbed a seat at the bar and realized that the dining room looked awfully crowded and noisy, so we decided that we should just sit in the bar when the waiter came back to tell us our table was now ready. We decided to just sit at a table in the bar.  Service got a little better from there, but the bartender - who was waiting on us - seemed pretty overwhelmed most of the evening since she seemed to be the only one making drinks and waiting on the bar patrons.  The food was good. We started with a meat and cheese tray, which was tasty. For dinner, I had the rigatoni entree - the pasta was a little dense/heavy, but the creamy tomato sauce with bacon was smoky and delicious - and the fella got the quail - which was pretty tasty and rare to find on a menu. For dessert, we took the bartender's suggestion and got the zeppoli (light, flaky, Italian donuts) with salted caramel gelato, which the fella said was the best thing he ate all night, and I said was too salty to eat.  The architecture is pretty cool, and I almost felt like I was in a castle or an old church. The ceilings had really cool exposed wooden beams, and the lights all had red globes, which made everything very dark and sexy. Seating in the dining area is a little tight and a little loud, so we thought the bar was where it was at, but there was also a pizza bar at the back of the dining room that looked pretty cool, too.  I think I'll give them another couple of months before I try them again, but I was just a little let down on my first visit."}
{"text":"I have been to Stagioni several time, and each time I got different experience.  last time I was there after we were greeted and seated I asked for a bold and dry wine and not fruity, and my waitress called someone who apparently was expert. She asked for my price range which was kind of awkward and I said $50-$60 and she answered with this price range you won't have that many good option. ;-( which I thought it was kind of disrespectful. So she finally chose one of them which was exactly $60.  My wine was smooth and fruity ,NOT BOLD,  NOT DRY. our waitress just open the wine and filled our glasses and that was the only time she served us and we poured the entire bottle in our glasses since she did not notice our glasses were low.  I  googled my wine and here is the link: the wine was average $13 and sold on variety from $11 to $22.   http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-109410-2012-lis-neris-cabernet-sauvignon-venezia-giulia-igt-friuli-venezia-giulia-italy    I am a foodie person and a wine lover. I will not trust their wine list any more.  Ask them if you can take your wine and pay the cork fee."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us decided to check this place out.  A couple of us got the mushroom soup $10 but the waitress told us it would be $8.  We both agreed that it was ruined with the pour of bay oil on top... in fact, 2.5 hrs later I still have that taste in my mouth.  One person got the halibut and said it was very good.  I got the Nettie Linguine (lamb) $27 and it was excellent !  One person got the lump crab bake $32 and said it was spicy and you could not taste the crab as a result, even though you could see it in there.  The gelato $3 for 1 scoop was very good.  I was told the steak $30 was very good.  I was also told the broccoli prosciutto pizza was excellent. This place is great if you are careful about what you order."}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day weekend so we had a limited menu. Parts of the meal were outstanding. Other parts were just eh. I would like to go back and try the regular menu.   Service was okay. We were forgotten a few times but they were super busy. Also, we got the table by the flatware station. If possible I would avoid that table. The table runners were bumping my chair and clanging silverware by my head all meal.   I would try them again and see if the experience improves under different circumstances."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent-  Service was pleasant and helpful and food was flavorful and delicious!  Try the octopus!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love! Came to Stagioni's on a 'pre-open' and the food was delicious! I can honestly say that the salmon is to die for. The risotto is also another one of my favorites. I highly doubt you could go to this restaurant and not be satisfied. The staff is very attentive and kind, the atmosphere is incredibly relaxed, and the building itself is gorgeous. Don't miss out on a great new addition to Charlotte! Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Charlotte in a while due to hectic work & person schedules, so when we finally planned a weekend trip my sister-in-law was extremely excited for us to try this restaurant.  Her and her husband had been to Stagioni a few times and had loved it every time so we really excited to go here.  The restaurant is small and very intimate, which is fine and it has a great atmosphere.  The first issue, which is really more of a personal opinion and may not bother other people, is that the waitress didn't ever write down any orders.  I usually am pretty particular with how I order, so it makes me nervous when the waiters don't write down my order.  So we were a big group and were pretty hungry so we started with 3 of the \"snacks\", arancini, brussel sprouts pizza and octopus.  The snacks were all delicious - but seriously tiny!  Think of the size of the condiment pots restaurants will sometimes give you, and that is seriously the size of each snack.  Get the truffled cauliflower - it is seriously one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  That item alone would give this place 5 stars, but there were too many other issues.  The pizza was delicious also - my only suggestion is to pre-cut it and skip the scissors, they are huge and awkward and kind of change the mood they're going for.  I didn't eat the octopus but it got mixed reviews at the table.  OK so the big issue - the arancini came and looked amazing!  We all quickly split the 3 pieces in half and each took our half. The first person took a bite and immediately spit it out and the second person did the same.  The balls were frozen in the center!  It was seriously strange.  There shouldn't have been any reason for them to be frozen, but they were. So we told the waitress and she took them away and a few minutes later they brought back a new plate.  The balls were luke warm and just weren't anything like the arancini I'm used - they weren't cheesy at all and were too lemony for my taste.  For the mains, I had the Fettuccini, which was OK, but nothing too special. My husband had the pork saltimbocca which was OK, but had way too much panceta compared to the size of pork and the vinegar in the polenta didn't seem to go.  All in all, the meal was decent but after everything we had heard we were pretty let down."}
{"text":"The food must be exceptional because the restaurant was nearly packed and it was a Tuesday night. I read reviews where people celebrated special occasions quite often, and they had positive things to say. It was a special occasion for us. I was helping my niece celebrate her 21st birthday in a memorable way.  She told me she wanted to go to a fancy place but not too fancy. Lol. So I did my homework. I spent days trying to choose a very nice place that a 21 year old picky eater would enjoy. I picked the wrong place to celebrate.   Everything was awesome until we stepped inside. We had done some major clothes shopping for her and had cocktails prior to  arriving... it was her first alcoholic beverage she had ever ordered. Then we arrived at the restaurant and found parking and took lots of pictures of us and the mansion. It was beautiful. Everything was perfect until we stepped inside.    As soon as I walked in the door it took everything I had to hide the disappointment on my face. I knew I was at the right place but it was nothing like I imagined it to be.  Had I not read all the great reviews I  would have thought I was in a Tavern or Pub. I have no problem spending money on fine dining. It's not their problem I did not like one of the dishes. I knew it was a gamble.   But I Do desire a tiny bit of ambiance. Some small indication that it is a Fine dining establishment.   It was very dark inside. Did not even feel like a bistro. I don't really know how to describe it. It had some beautiful art on the walls that I could see close by where we were sitting.  We didn't have to wait and everyone from the hostess, wait person and bartender were very nice. Our table was super small. With tables to our left and right. So at first I thought to myself. Great....no privacy. I wanted to talk to her about some personal matters. But as we sat down I quickly realized we were not going to be able to talk at all!!!  If we both leaned forward across the table and were LESS than a foot away from each other and spoke as loud as we could with out yelling, then we could talk to one another. I was so disappointed. I was so angry because I felt like I let my niece down, but I tried to make the best of it. It was not going to be the leisurely dinner that I thought it would be. We had to basically yell all of our questions and orders to the nice woman who was waiting on our table and we had to yell to the kind bartender who came to our table to help make something special for my niece to enjoy. And because the place was busy busy, everything FELT rushed. They did not rush us though. We ate quickly and left as soon as we could.   We had one appetizer, a pizza each, one dessert and three drinks. The tab before gratuity was $96.00. The appetizer was the SQUASH BLOSSOMS (13) and it was quite nice... My niece had the PEPPERONI + SAUSAGE pizza minus the sausage (15) and I had the TARTUFI pizza (15). Unfortunely it was way too sweet for me to eat. I took it home and ended up just throwing it out. My mistake. I should have ordered something different.  My favorite was the desert ZEPPOLI. (8).     So the food is really good. Seems like a place thst corporate business diners would enjoy . Not a place for a leisurely calm or romantic dinner. At least that's the way I felt. IF I was a guest of someone who took me there it would have been fine. But it was a special occasion, and not what I was looking for that night. It's going to be hard to rate. The people are nice and efficient.  It's just does not have the ambiance I want when the entr√©es   are around $30 each. We had just pizza. OBTW. I did like my nieces pizza!!!  Ciao."}
{"text":"Like a villa you'd find in the heart of Tuscany, the setting of Stagioni could not be in a more perfect building.  Somehow in the midst of Charlotte, this gem of a restaurant transports you all the way to Italy without the TSA getting in the way.  The setting is perhaps the greatest asset.  It's incredibly homey, and oh so Italian trattoria.  The waiters are friendly and passionate about the food.  Ask anyone of them and you'll surely hear a colorful description of the ingredients.  Don't forget to ask about the wine.  What was likely one of my few chances to eat here, I wanted to try everything, especially a pasta.  Two great options; the garganelli and the gnocchi caught my attention.  I ended up with the gnocchi which came with a rabbit and thyme.  The thyme really masked some of the rabbit's gamey flavor.  This was preceded by a pretty terrific house ricotta, which in my opinion is perhaps on par with what I'd find at my favorite Italian grocery in New York.    The wine list here is legitimately Italian, with plenty of great options from all over Italy.  I was glad to see some Amarone on the list, even if a bit pricier of a bottle.  It's one of those wines you could savor over a long Italian dinner.  4.5 stars.  I can't help but think that this place is a bit under appreciated.  In any other city, they would bustling every night.  Don't wait.  Come here and definitely order like the Italians do and linger, with a bottle of wine of course."}
{"text":"Very good new restaurant.  had the porchetta which was very moist and perfectly cooked.  apps are good but very, very small."}
{"text":"I'm usually a Bruce Moffett fan. Never had a disappointing meal at Barrington's and never had a bad meal at Good Food. I'm sorry but Stagioni fell short of expectations for me. I would put it a long third place vs. the other two.  The restaurant is loud when it's busy (and it's usually busy), not a sort of place you like to shout to your friends or when you are on a date in my humble opinion. The ambiance was great for a bar, but the tables were a little too close together for my comfort.  The piece of resistance (why can't I create accents on here is beyond me...), the food:  The liver mousse was ok, pickled veggies were a bit too drowned in the dressing for my taste. The octopus was nothing out of this world, but I like octopus more than most so I've had very good ones, this place doesn't have it. The best appetizer had to be the pork belly, very nicely done, crunchy skin with a balsamic dressing that cuts the heaviness pretty well - my favorite dish of the evening. The veal was not good - you can't make something good just by adding bacon on top... Which is what I felt they did here. The quail unfortunately had the same fault... Bacon doesn't make it better - both dishes were overpowered by the richness of the bacon.   The service was less than stellar for a restaurant of this magnitude.   They have a good wine list and to their defense, Stagioni's menu should change seasonally, I'm looking forward to what summer has available.  All in all, this trip to Stagioni wasn't worth the price tag... but I'll have to give it another shot soon..."}
{"text":"Great food! Very cute restaurant. It is a little loud when the main room is full but the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"We had two apps, $13.00 for 3 pork meatballs and $15.00 for a fig tart that was to sweet that it should have been a dessert rather than an app. Place is way expensive for Italian food. The wine menu again is very expensive for the selection, same glass of pinto at wolfgangs is $3.00 less cheaper. Glad we tried it but you pay for the Myers Park area instead of quantity and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Went to Stagioni for the kitchen CoLab dinner with Atlanta chef, Michael Patria. We looked forward to the fun concept, highlighting new dishes prepared by the guest chef.  The food did not disappoint, ordered the charred romanesco with anchovy vinaigrette. Delicious! Grilled romaine salad was ok, although not very grilled, a major flavor enhancer not highlighted. Main dishes, I ordered the mahi mahi with burnt orange sauce - just lovely, perfectly cooked fish and wonderful Med style flavors of the orange sauce complemented it perfectly.  Dining partner ordered the pappardelle with gorgonzola and radicchio - again, great balance of acidity and flavor.  Additional slight disappointment, lackluster wait staff and grumpy server.  Overall, great night out in a lively restaurant."}
{"text":"Perfect!  Fantastic flavors, well educated wait staff & comfortable setting.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me explain for my slightly harsh review. I had super high expectations of this place because of heir sister restaurant, Good Food on Montford, which happens to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I think the Muffett Group have what it takes and can take a critic or two from a fan to give them the push  The decor itself bothers me. I can't put my finger on it. The tables are so close together I almost took a spoonful of my right hand diners risotto.   I love Prosecco and they happen to have have it on tap, sounds awesome right? It did To me too until I had it. It tastes like Brut rather than Prosecco, it was dry not sweet but I love bubbles so that wasn't entirely a complaint (drank it with ease).   I am convinced that The fried chickpeas are dehydrated and not made in house but unexpected so I give them that. However all the other antipastos aka appetizers we had fell short. I happened to really enjoy the Brussel Sprout Pizza, so unexpectedly delicious.   I ordered the veal saltimbocca was so disappointing. While my first few bites I really wanted to like it , the veal was really thin, then followed a layer of cheese and a layer of prosciutto- all this on top was amazing it over powered the veal. The creamy polenta was fantastic though.   I have tried to make it a point to only try desserts that are either a staple to the origin of the food served or if it sounds out of the norm...so I tried the Zeppolis which were an airy delight! I also tried the Pear Skilet Cake with Avocado ice cream , sounds amazing right? Yes but individually, not sure of they paired. Why not a salted cartelized bacon in the avocado ice cream? Just not with that cake. I leave it to them to fix.   Let me touch on service. The bread with olive oil was served while we were almost done with our appetizers , really? However our service hosts themselves were very friendly.  All in all, I'm hoping for a change to come the spring/summer. I hope I won't be disappointed, again."}
{"text":"This was a big party of 10 - we all wanted to try this beautiful restaurant that we had seen from Providence Rd. They were able to work with our people and all the orders. We had a few of the appetizers, ..Fried Clam Strips...good tasting batter but very Chewy! Shisitto Peppers that were the bomb!! So good,  fresh grilled and dusted with flaky sea salt! Mushrooms that were ..just okay.  On to the Wine...all bottles extremely expensive..very hard to pick between a 42 and 38 when all the rest  jump up to 50 - 60 and on up.. They really should change this and put in a few less expensive wines..Entrees are very high..starting with Pastas for 18.00 and Up and they are small portions. I had the Carmalized Onion and Truffle Oil Pizza. It was good but very sweet, like it was a Onion Jam on the top. Some of our party had the Grouper ( 30.00) and liked it. Others had the Gnocchi with Pork Sugo and said it was delicious.  Best part of the evening was the Zeppole. Perfect , light and fresh ! .The other winners was the Peach skillet cake. .. I would go back for dessert and  perhaps a coffee...non was offered to us. Also no Parm...whats an Italian place without Parm????"}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Charlotte! Hands down the most incredible Italian food I've had in this state. Authentic with fresh sauces and pastas. Incredible entrees, excellent service and a unique and fitting atmosphere! It's amazing! Make a reservation. Stagioni is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Very impressed! Keep it up moffet brothers, you never disappoint."}
{"text":"Incredible dinner at Stagioni. We made reservation and arrived a little bit early and were still sat right away. We shared a burrata appetizer, prosciutto pizza and the cannelloni. All were incredibly delicious. The cannelloni was OUTSTANDING! Service and atmosphere were excellent."}
{"text":"A perfect evening to dine outdoors with friends at this beautiful Tuscan revival mansion! Wonderful ambiance! Upscale brown paper bags filled with thinly sliced airy, crispy bread is served with a carafe of rosemary-infused olive oil. Loved the bread, added salt & pepper to the oil, so the 2-3 slices I ate became a must! Especially with the bold, yet smooth chianti. They prepare creative dishes using local, seasonal flavors mixed with some Italian staples to make delicious & interesting meals. So go expecting to venture outside the usual Italian fare. Their menu constantly changes bc they cook with the seasons and whatever is fresh at the local farms. Really like this concept!  Now for the food:  Starter:  char-grilled octopus & sliced gigande beans atop a saffron aioli was very good & quite filling. It was all about the mixture of the ingredients bc the octopus alone was not the star. Primo: Truffle tagliatelle  lacked flavor & was alittle dry. I probably would have liked a sausage for added flavor, but at $32 for a one-person pasta dish ... that wasn't happening! Too bad there wasn't anymore room for dessert but I will go back to try more creations ... especially zeppole! Everyone was happy with everything they had, especially the warm asparagus salad & the primo, sweet potato cavatelli w.wild boar sausage, apples, collard greens & toasted pecans. All of their pastas, bread & sausage are made fresh, on site. Another nice concept! (GF is available) The 20% tip is already on the bill and bc of it, they make sure service is upto par. Service was excellent! Very knowledgable, assertive & mannerful which made for a great dining experience. Octopus+tagliatelle + 1 glass chianti w.tip just over $74. It's a treat ... an adventure I recommend trying.  4 bc I wasn't thrilled w.the truffle tagliatelle."}
{"text":"For our 13th anniversary, my wife and I decided to try this relatively new Northern Italian restaurant in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. The meal was terrific, particularly the fried Risotto Balls that started things off, and the INCREDIBLE Gnocchi that followed. Both paired perfectly with a wonderful bottle of Barolo from their extensive selection of Italian wines.  I was a bit disappointed, though, with the Grouper we ordered for our main course. It came highly recommended by our server, but I found it to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I would not order it again. For dessert, we shared a fantastic plate of zeppoli, along with a pair of cannolis that were decent, but unfortunately underwhelming. For the price, I expected more.  I wanted to like this restaurant more than I did, but considering they've only been open a few months, I'm hopeful the menu selections will improve by our next visit. There are better restaurants in Charlotte for the money, but Stagioni is a welcome addition to the local dining scene, and one that I hope will be around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Horrific. One of our dinners which was simple pasta with olive oil and shrimp was gross and returned. The waitress came back and actually said that the chef asked, and I quote, how does she want it?\"  Waitress was awful. Nothing special for a birthday. Small portions. Yes they comped that one dinner and I am not listing everything that was bad, let me say that the entire meal should have been comped! When we walked in, there was no acknowledgement. This is a very very expensive restaurant. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Stagioni. The service was wonderful - friendly, attentive, and gave great recommendations. Even offered to take a photo of us when they saw us attempting a self-timer shot outside.   We started with an octopus appetizer, which was delicious. So tender, and a great mix of flavors.   My husband ordered the pesce fresco which was grouper. I ordered the cannelloni with lamb bolognese. Both were fresh, interesting takes on the dishes. I expected ground lamb but it was finely shredded. The cannelloni was a rich dish, but so flavorful!   I only wish we'd had room for dessert. I heard the fried bread dipped in caramel sauce is excellent. Speaking of bread, I ate way too much of it prior to our food arriving. So so good.   Also loved the atmosphere. So yeah, five stars it is."}
{"text":"Stagioni continues to baffle me... I've been 5 times now and each experience has swung wide one way or the other, either really good or really underwhelming.   The first time I went, they'd only been open for a couple weeks. Food was decent but service was way off. I blame that on the newness. It took me almost a year to visit again. This time, our experience was out of this world and I thought they'd hit their stride. Food was amazing and service was even better. But then... Over the next three visits, one was a miss, one was a hit and the last, our family-style Christmas Eve dinner was somewhere in the middle.   I'll use what we ate on Christmas Eve as an example of their inconsistency...   Starters were spot on -- arranchini, truffled eggs, pickled veggies and warm ricotta were all so good and well timed coming to the table.   Salad came next. In Italy, that's a serious faux pas, btw. Salad comes at the end of the meal, after the secondi. The Caesar salad we had was so mundane it wasn't even worth eating. Some wilted greens, a lot of cheese and a garlic crouton thing that had gone a little soggy.   Primi were 2 pastas -- the sweet potato gnocchi was perfect but the spaghetti with prawns, while tasty, was awkward to eat on account of the head on prawns. Our waitress told us that the dish usually came with scallops. Would have been a much better option!   Secondi was where they really lost me. We were dreaming of the wood oven roasted porchetta all day but when it came, were so let down, I almost cried. The dish was a pork loin wrapped in pork belly. The center part with the loin was good enough but was surrounded by the greasiest, fattiest piece of pork  belly I've ever had. It's making my stomach turn just thinking about it again. HUGE let down!   We choose spinach and potatoes for our sides. The potatoes were good but let's be honest, it's pretty hard to screw up potatoes. The spinach was really bitter, to the point where I think it might have actually been Swiss chard.   Dessert was an average assortment of cookies and small, honey soaked dough balls.   So, therein lies Stagioni's problem. Sometimes they're spot on, sometimes they're awful. When you're paying an average of $100+ per person (with drinks), the inconsistency is hard to swallow. I think we'll probably be back but stick with pizza at the bar instead of racking up a huge tab on food that might or might not be worth it."}
{"text":"Staggionis is awesome , we had an amazing meal. 1. Service was great and fast and efficient, staff was totally in tune for great dining experience  2. The restaurant is beautiful and charming. 3. Now to the food: The Mussels were amazingly good , must have The pork belly was good, but I wouldn't order it again  The gnocchi was seriously heavenly-order this! The fettuccini with pork ragu was sooo good! The cannoli with pistachio gelato was perfect ending and my girlfriend got the zeppoli and she is still raving about them! Overall a must go to in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Food was good but portions are really small for the price. Wine is overpriced.   Bring your wallet."}
{"text":"The dinner group met here.  From the pictures, it seemed like a fancy place but when I arrived and saw the servers in jeans and t-shirts, I realized it was not so fancy.    Although the house is somewhat large, it appears Stagioni is only using a portion of the building so the restaurant interior is really not that large.  There is one room for the bar and a few bar tables.  Then there is a dining room in the next room with an open kitchen.  The decor consists of various mirrors on one wall and a bookshelf on another wall.  There is a counter in front of the bar for additional seating.    The menu is contemporary Italian with pastas, fish, pizza and everything is creatively displayed.  I ordered the Tega Hills Greens salad which was stacked lettuce with goat cheese and on the side a few beets, pine nuts with a very light dressing.  It was wonderful and so beautifully presented.  For an entree, I went with the Flounder which was a rectangular portion of fish over greens with molded potatoes and and drizzled sauce on the side.  It also was beautifully presented.  The crust on the fish was wonderful and the greens was very unique.  I could sit there and savor every bite trying to figure out what the flavors were.    For desert, I went with the pear cake which came with avocado gellato and homemade whipped cream.  Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the cake.  It actually reminded me somewhat of a bread pudding.  The gellato was creamy but I didn't really catch the avocado flavor.    Also, don't let the size of the parking lot fool you.  There is additional parking behind the restaurant.  Just drive down Fenton a little and you'll see the entrance.  You'll also see a different view of the building which is has a patio that would be great for outdoor dining but it went unused."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night . We had a 545 res and decided to have a cocktail at the bar since it was only 515. Note we were the only ones in the restaurant s few minutes later the bartender throws out bill at us  I ask her what r u doing?? I only had s sip of my drink and this place is completely empty immediately the mgr comes over and explains to us if they don't rush all their patrons they will not b able to turn the tables 3 times s night. So rude the mgr then asks can I seat u at your table?? We answered every table is empty so here's my credit card and we walked next store to Napa. At Napa they treated us like kings and had a terrific meal. Good bye stagion u deserve to go out of business!!!!! Never had such a bad experience in a totally empty place."}
{"text":"REALLY great food.  But crowded!  Need less tables or more room!  charcuterie was excellent.  wine list really great.  Everything on the menu needed more explanation though so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here.  Alive, but respectful of privacy.  Pizza Bar is worth it.  Chef efficient with an expert crew.  Very happy to go again.  Didn't think I'd like squash blossoms... ;) but the preparation was fresh.  Yes."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago.  Overall, it was pretty good and we would go back again.  We started with the crostini and choices of spreads, all pretty decent.  I had the brussel sprout pizza sans the meat and it was pretty good.  Although, it could use maybe a little more depth in flavor when the meat isn't present.  I have to applaud them for being creative enough to use parsnip puree as the sauce.  My husband tried the agnolotti and he said it was pretty good. As a side note, I really didn't dig the d√©cor.  It just didn't seem to all go together.  I didn't deduct any points for this, but I wasn't impressed at all by it."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice in the restaurant. I love that they take reservations.  We were seated quickly and immediately brought waters.  The service was a 5 and our waitress was wonderful.    My rating on the food is a 3.5.  We order two hard cheeses and prosciutto.  This came with bread and was really delicious.    Our next course was the beet ravioli which was very unique and not what I expected but it was a very small portion.  For pasta we got the lamb rigatoni.  It was a little over cooked, but since I was our anniversary I didn't want to send it back.     For dessert we did the gelato sandwich.  My husband loved it but I didn't care for it.  The waitress brought us a small glass of champagne to celebrate our anniversary which was really nice."}
{"text":"It only took about 5 visits for me to concede... I just can't get enough.  The food, vibe, and service are absolutely fantastic and at a reasonable pricepoint.  There are numerous places in Charlotte that are absolutely overrated and charge far too much for their fare.  This is not the case.    The menu is often changing and keeps it fresh.  It's always fun and a great place to celebrate or just have a nice casually romantic dinner with your love.  I highly recommend the charcuterie, pizzas, short rib, fish options, and of course... the zeppole (one of the greatest desserts in Charlotte)  It's one of the only places in Charlotte that I can recommend, rave, and pump up and feel extremely confident that it will live up to my recommendation."}
{"text":"Definitely one of those places that seems fancy, but it certainly isn't. We were visiting family at one of the (many) hospitals in the area, and were absolutely not dressed up. If anything, we were even dressed more casually than normal. Just to be certain, I checked up front, and they were fine with it - though they did put us at the back at the pizza bar, so there is that. And we were right outside of the men's room, so take that for what you will.  The good news it that you are (generally) facing the pizza oven, and not the men's room, but if you turn around, it is there in all its glory, should you choose to enjoy it.  Beyond that, the staff is very helpful, and they will serve you, location and all, no matter what you are wearing. So that's awesome. The food selection is solid, even though we were mostly sticking to the left side of the menu - no main courses here. Just too much going on. The good news is that there is plenty there to keep you interested and full along the way.  Since we were there early, it made for a nice break, but as things filled up, it got a bit louder, and naturally the location we were in saw some more traffic, so there is that, but the service didn't falter, and the food came out on a decent pace. Definitely worth trying the place again when we have more time to enjoy. And perhaps make a reservation for a better seat."}
{"text":"Based on all the great reviews, we decided to try Stagioni for a special occasion this past Thursday. I was looking forward to trying their house-made pasta. We had a reservation for 630pm and arrived to an empty restaurant only to be seated in a corner. Not off to a good start but I'll be a sport and let it slide as long as I don't have to sit in the walkway looking at the kitchen.   Our waitress came over as soon as we sat down, barely having opened menus and asked if we were ready to order drinks. Without suggestions, she left us for a couple minutes before returning again and asking us for our drinks order. Did she have somewhere else to be? I don't understand why we were being rushed. We ordered a glass of wine and the mango habanero cocktail at around $12 each. The waitress asked us if we'd dined at Stagioni before and seemed annoyed when we said no because now she had to walk us through the menu as she told us about the daily specials. To start, we went with the 3/$16 charcuterie and cheese plate. I was expecting pickles or mustard on the side but it came with honey and toasted bread. We tried the prosciutto, bresaola and a soft cheese. Reasonable portions for all three and nicely plated . We also decided on an order of squash blossoms. There were 3 on the plate; they were very sweet and heavily sauced. Lots of components on the plate; seems they love their micro-greens at Stagioni. For mains, my husband ordered one of the pizzas which came with scissors. I'm sorry but scissors? At a $$$ restaurant? He ate most of the pizza and took the last two pieces home. I ordered the shrimp pasta which was heavy on cream sauce with 5 shrimp. I tasted grit as I was finishing my plate. Off-putting for sure. We skipped dessert and made our way out of the restaurant $105 lighter.   Overall, the service is odd with plates being dropped off by runners with no explanation, rushed pacing and several staff members hanging around in the bar area socializing and eating in view of patrons. The decor of the restaurant is strange with red lamps which always make me think \"red light district\". We saw several tables using their smartphone flashlights to read the small print on the menus in the dark. Do they realize the customer who can afford to eat here wears reading glasses and would appreciate the lights on and the menus at a 14pt font? For how expensive the restaurant is, I would think they could pay attention to the patrons' needs and train their staff to read personal cues better. Too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, excellent service and great food make for a 5 star review. Date night or group dinner, this place is worth it. The wine list is ALL Italian and it's not small. All the pasta is made fresh daily. The fettuccine with pork ragu was delicious and hearty. Try to snacks, especially the mozzarella crostini."}
{"text":"Wow... highly over-rated. Our server was seriously unprofessional, \"constantly\" touching the men at our table (and every other man in the restaurant), her wine recommendation was terrible, and she wouldn't tell us about the menu until we'd decided on a wine. Knowing what I was going to have for dinner would have been helpful when deciding on a wine. Our table was too small for our party. The food was mediocre at best. The cheese and meat plate was delicious, though the piece of cheese was minuscule. We won't return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good place for a date. We ordered a cheese & meat board- great starter. The pepperoni & sausage pizza was one of the best gourmet pizzas I've ever tried-  big enough for your meal. The gnocchi was also amazing & savory. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great ambience and is one of the better in the city. While I have found the pasta to be less than al dente in the past, the pizzas are always wonderful! Especially Tartufi!  Two pizzas can easily be shared and thoroughly enjoyed.  Matter fact, just skip it and eat at their sister restaurant Good Food."}
{"text":"Brussels Sprout Pizza (see photo) ... the end!    More?  Okay, here's the real review:  Though we arrived without making reservations on a late Friday evening, it didn't take long to get seated at the pizza bar.  The GM (and hostess for the evening) was a friendly, bubbly gal who handled our waiting time expectations very well.  Besides, we didn't mind since it gave us a chance to warm up near the fireplace.  On to the food that evening ...  Stuffed Peppadews, Anchovies and Radicchio, & Chicken Skins w/Olive Spread, House-Made Ricotta & Eggplant Caponata - A little gimmicky, but guests can select from a wide array of snacks to whet the appetite.  Of our selection, Chicken Skins, while simple, were executed with precision such that it was light, crispy, and not too greasy.  Also, I could put their Olive Spread on anything - hell, a napkin.  Napkin with Olive Spread?  Seconds, please.    Grilled Octopus - Slightly hesitant on octopus in general, but better than your run-of-the-mill calamari appetizer.  Flavors abound.    Brussels Sprout Pizza - Friggin' amazing.  Fired to perfection in a stone pizza oven, the marriage of pecorino and pancetta complimented the Brussels sprout so well we scarfed down the pizza within minutes.  It had a tinge of heat (spiciness) underscoring the pizza - gotta love that too.  Rest assured, any pizza elsewhere from here out will severely pale in comparison.  YOU MUST GET THIS (and invite me).  Gnocchi - IMO, one of the staples to judge an Italian restaurants by.  Stagioni passes the test.  Zeppoli - Italian beignets with a scoop of salted caramel gelato.  While the gelato was a great way to end the meal, the beignets could have been baked a little longer.  Hey, every restaurant has to have SOMETHING to work on - this minor point is theirs.  A spectacular dining experience.  I look forward to coming back for the Brussels Sprout Pizza (of course) and the Brodetto Di Pesci (the two chicks next to me were loving this mixed seafood dish - think Herbal Essence shampoo commercials).     Oh yeah, big ups to Wilson, yo.  Great service and on-point recommendations.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Omg I don't know where to even start on this place. Simply AMAZING. Every single dish we ordered tasted like a piece from heaven. From the clams, oysters, pizza, pasta,drinks, and even the plain bread. Everything was phenomenal. The service was wonderful as well. Our waiter check in on us plenty of times and had everything under control. I would recommend making a reservation because it does get full. Not a single table was empty and I wouldn't imagine one to be since it's such a good restaurant and great quality food. Awesome place to have a nice dinner with friends and family and enjoy a nice meal. The only thing is that it's a little hot inside. Maybe the AC wasn't working properly, but I was able to manage since the food was so yummy. I wanted to sit in their beautiful patio outside, but it was raining when I went. I will definitely be back for more. 100% recommended"}
{"text":"I really try not to jump into the \"anti social media\" feeding frenzy of posting every bad experience and this was one I was going to keep in house but upon going to the website to send a private note to the manager there is not a \"contact us\" tab that I could readily find which struck me as the extreme attitude I experienced here.  Quickly I was very excited to meet a close local friend and her precocious daughter, who's manners are above reproach.  Ironically her father is a \"name\" in Charlotte hospitality but names do not matter, every well mannered customer is entitled to gracious service!  It was one of those bitter New York frigid days, we both got there about 5:15 and were waiting patiently outside for the 5:30 open.  About 5:20 a delivery person knocked on the locked door, a dressed gentleman opened the door for him, looked at us, closed the door and locked it.   We were both just astounded and left for some where more welcoming."}
{"text":"I would love to be able to post a review, but I've not had much luck getting past their inane reservation system.  I tried to make a reservation several evenings only to repeatedly have my call go directly to a voice message saying that due to heavy business they do not answer their phone in the evenings and only take reservations between 2-6pm.   If they're that busy, you would think they could hire someone to answer the phone in the evening hours. I even went as far as calling Barringtons, one of the \"sister\" restaurants and had no luck there either.   When I did call back the next day, the young lady that answered the phone sounded annoyed by my phone call.   I asked for a reservation a week away only to be rudely told we're all booked.   Not even....is there another night you might want to come....can I put you on a wait list....nothing welcoming or accommodating on her part.    For a restaurant group with the reputation that they have in town, you would think their front of house staff would be better trained.   I hope their good publicity has not gone to their heads."}
{"text":"Been her 2x. 1st was phenomenal. 2nd time was fantastic in every manor except they unloaded the salt in a couple of our dishes beyond the normal restaurant salt/butter hit. If we were not somewhat pressed for time I would have sent it back. Really good food doesn't need the masking of a heavy salt download to the point of unbalancing the meal. If I go back I will clearly announce to take it easy on the salt."}
{"text":"Visited Stagioni with my parents and was wowed by the creativity of the dishes, the flavor and service. Our waiter was super attentive and gave us recommendations in each section of the menu - all of which were extremely solid since we ordered some of his recos. I had the tartufi pizza, which comes with its own set of scissors to cut into slices. So fun and effective. The pizza was slightly sweet from the bed of caramelized onions on the crust, layered with fresh mozzarella and tons of wild mushrooms and a generous swirl of truffle oil that adds a delicious earthy flavor to the pizza. My parents ordered the truffles cauliflower to start - a delicious and rich dip served with paper thin crackers. Highly recommend. My dad ordered the Caesar salad, which was gently dressed with the most aromatic croutons. My mom then ordered the cavatelli - short cut, curled pasta with lots of veggies and a light sauce. Really lovely. My dad ordered the spaghetti with scallops and literally cleaned his plate. Everything was delicious. We can't wait to come back here as soon as possible and try everything else on the menu! Maybe tomorrow...!"}
{"text":"Oh my mother of everything food Holy. This place is so amazing and the bartender Russ knows the wines, appetizers, salads and entrees like Michael Angelo knows his brushes. This is the best Italian food I've EVER had and I've been to some of the best in NY, San Fran, Houston, New Orleans etc. The pizza dough is homemade, the sauce is homemade, the pasta - yep, from frick'n SCRATCH people!   I'll be in Charlotte next weekend and hitting this joint again my friends!!!  What a find!  Go here and your welcome!"}
{"text":"2.13.2018 - My wife and I joined some close friends at the bar to celebrate her birthday. Lee Ann, Russ, and the rest of the staff took great care of us before we headed to our dinner reservation next door at Aix en Provence. Our service experience continued there with a call from Lee Ann in which we were treated to a souffle, port, and coffee. A great experience all around as a guest but really special because my wife felt it was one of the best birthdays ever. Great service alongside great food, friends, and atmosphere. Definitely making our next date night with Stagioni. Thank you."}
{"text":"We visited Stagioni on New Years Eve 2015, after looking at the chef chose pre-fix menu I was very excited to try EVERYTHING Stagioni had to offer. My boyfriend and I were joined by another couple for our reservation. When we first pulled up to the restaurant I was very surprised where this little gem was tucked off providence ! - there isn't a lot of parking out front but if you go down to the next side street there is plenty! Overall I was pleased with our entire dining experience. We were warmly greeted at the door and shown to our table which was awaiting our arrival. Prior to the first course of amuse bouche the nice waiter brought over complimentary prosecco (#winning!!). Dining with other foodies is great and we decided to ensure we ordered at least one of everything on the menu. For the antipasto we tried the burrato, a pork sausage tortellini and a beef carpaccio. All of these dishes were delicious, we especially liked the \"pot liquor brodo\" poured into the tortellini ( essentially a delicious fancy broth). Next up was primi which we feasted on a sweet potato cavatelli  and a spaghetti lamb sugo. The ladies both voted we loved the potato cavatelli with the brown butter sage and Brussels sprouts while both of the guys preferred the lamb spaghetti. The spaghetti had a delicious essence of citrus which provides a balance to the hearty lamb sauce. We all really enjoyed the rustic pastas which clearly were made in house -- who doesn't love fresh pasta!? The main event was the secondi ( largest portions) consisting of a grouper  over saffron risotto , porchetta with red lentils and a wood fired NY strip. All of these dishes were good but underwhelmed me ( can we go back to the other courses ?). FYI if you don't know what porchetta is it is essentially a roll of pork surrounded with pork belly (fat) - although I've had pork belly before my outside bites of this dish had me turn my plate over to my boyfriend ( he liked it though!!) The best part of the NY strip was the parsnip pur√©e and the black truffle veal sauce.  We ended the meal with an assortment of small desserts including dark chocolate truffles and fudge.  Overall a great meal to share with friends who are open to trying new things - picky eaters beware this is not for you!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Tried a little of everything from appetizers to desert and it was flawless. Lovely atmosphere; highly recommend for a group dinner or date night."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for comfort food!! Patrick is the greatest sever/manager made my visit so welcoming and fun!   I'm so lucky to have enjoyed it!!   Who knew there was a mini castle tucked away on Providence rd. in Charlotte, NC!!   I feel my life has seriously changed!   The ambience is dim and perfect for intimate groups. Very warm cozy and small. Reservations highly recommend for weekend dining. Unless you can score seats at the pizza oven bar which is first come first serve.   Decor was not what I was expecting but who cares when you're drinking wine and eating great food with great company.   I ordered the gnocchi and it was to die for. Warm and fresh but also light and comforting. It was one of the pasta dishes with protein. Pork to be exact.  Honestly if I was having a bad day I could just come here and it would turn my frown upside down!!"}
{"text":"This place makes Charlotte better.  Here is the low down...  the parking lot is tiny, better drive a European car to park!  Once inside, you are greeted by a hostess with several high-top tables. They will then take you to your table in the back, of our made a reso (highly suggested).  The dining area a very spacious and is opened to the kitchen where you can see the cooks prepare your food.  There are even bar seating options where you can sit almost in the kitchen.  The cooks serve you directly from the kitchen; it doesn't get more fresh than that!  I appreciate the open concept, because many time it can be unnerving not knowing what is exactly going on behind those closed kitchen doors.     The atmosphere is very warm, yet dark. I'd say it's a lovely place for a date or a cozy dinner with close friends.  The drink menu has a huge range of wines as well as specialty drinks.  I have always been amazed and pleased by the level of professional service they offer their patrons.  They do not hire jut anyone, and that is very much appreciated.  Their staff are very knowledgeable about the food and are clearly invested in you having a pleasant experience.  Our waiter made some fine selections for us off the wine menu.  As a vegetarian, he even offered some combinations that made my tastebuds extremely satisfied.  #TrufflePasta  He even told us about wine tasting a they have started hosting, which would be of great interest to me.    I certainly suggest a reso! This can be hard to get in otherwise.   You may need a European car to park here, but you will need a mini van to take you away.  The food is so delicious you will overeat, that's a promise."}
{"text":"Just finished a fabulous meal here with my wife. We had the 3 Antipasti, Eggplant, Olives, and Ricotta Spread. Added the mortadella for good measure. All were fabulous. Secondi, we had the mussels and the squash blossoms. The squash blossoms were outstanding, and the mussel broth with saffron is just amazing. We split the fish of the day, NC grouper. Again, very well prepared. Throw in the tart of the day, and the chocolate tart as well, and a very solid meal for two. The service was spot on. When we go back, we'll go with at least two other couples, so we can do family style. So many good options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a white villa type building off of Providence Road.  Plentiful parking is not evident,  but my friend told me that there is parking behind the building.  I parked in the adjoining parking lot. Stagioni is decorated in the Italian country style.  I love the use of wood, and we were given large, cloth napkins, reminiscent of beautiful dish towels.  All I could hear was happy diners until I visited the ladies' room.  Frank was blasting, in a good way.  I wish I was able to hear this music in the dining room.  It would have added to the ambiance. We were given bread in paper bags, along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I don't eat bread except for special occasions.  When I tasted these rolls, that is all I wanted.  I had two and don't regret a single bite. I ordered three sides:  spinach, creamy polenta, and wood fired mushrooms.  The plentiful portions were cooked and seasoned just perfectly.  The polenta could have been frozen and turned into a savory ice cream.  It was just that creamy. We finished with a shot of limoncello.  A refreshing ending to a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Stagioni is awesome. It is such awesome authentic italian food with a constantly changing menu. The ambiance is great and the servers are very attentive. The food is an expected price point and then let you bring in your own wine (with a corking fee). Overall - have been here several times and never had a bad dish or experience."}
{"text":"My experience was not all that I hoped it would be but I am going to try and keep this review fair and balanced.  First impressions...My manager was taking me to dinner to discuss \"work-related\" things but she loves good food and service as much as I do.  She called 3 times to make a reservation for Tuesday evening but never received a call back. Fail #1.    Moving on....We were excited to be there and the atmosphere was just perfect.  As soon as I pulled up to the restaurant I was excited because even the building has an old-world feel.  The inside decor seems to be a modern twist on a tuscan vibe.  The exposed kitchen, the rustic wood tables, dim lighting, etc.  I loved it.    We were sitting for a while before anyone really greeted us but eventually a young girl came up and poured our water.  She made sure to tell us \"I am not your waitress.  I am just here to pour water.\"  It was almost like she wanted to make sure we didn't ask her for anything else.  Eventually our waitress surfaced and she seemed in a rush and a bit distracted.  I mean the place was packed but the place is only so big so it didn't seem overwhelming but maybe these are the kinks that are still being worked out as a new establishment.    We decided to start with a lemon drop martini.  I followed my boss' lead on this because I don't even know the last time I had a \"cocktail\" but she wanted me to try it as it is one of her favorites!  Enter Fail #2....The martini was super sweet and not very lemony and it was like drinking straight up lemonade.  I was told that the sugar is usually on the rim and it balances the sour part but this was just all thrown in and not concocted very well honestly.  Even I knew that.  Moving on...  We ordered a couple appetizers to start.  At first I thought ordering two appetizers for two people seemed a little piggish but once they came out and they were more in proportion to serve a small child, I was glad we went with two.  We ordered the risotto balls (don't know the fancy italian term) and they were fried balls with a risotto and mozzarella center.  The were served on a plate with a nice marina sauce for dipping.  They were excellent.  3 balls came with the appetizer.  We also ordered the braciole which was very good as well.  It was shaped like a pinwheel and there was a mozzarella cheese in the center.  It was also served with a marinara sauce.  The meat was very tender and the flavor was perfect.  I enjoyed this dish.  Fail #3 was because we never got any bread that was supposed to be served prior to our meal.  We asked a waitress about it and she acted like she was perplexed but eventually brought us two rolls.  We proceeded to order our entrees and chose two pasta dishes with a side of spinach.  The pasta was very good, creative combinations, nice flavoring, etc.  We got about half way through our meals and realized we never saw the spinach--Fail #4.  Our waitress was absolutely nowhere to be found.  Actually, she was found....found behind the bar.  I don't know if she was on double duty or why she was playing two roles but she was doing neither of them very well.  She never came to check on us during our meal.  We found the \"water\" girl and told her about our missing spinach so she said she would go take care of it.  Guess what?  She didn't.  Eventually I saw our waitress passing by so I called out for her and told her we never received our spinach.  She apologized but that was that.  She asked if we still wanted it but by that point of course we didn't!  We just asked for the dessert menu.    Desserts:  The pear cake was recommended because it was a staple at \"Good Food.\"  It was served with Avocado ice cream.  The cake was just a bland piece of cake in a little square with maybe 2 very thinly sliced pears on the top.  Odd.  Not great.  The avocado ice cream had a distinct flavor and it was creamy but somewhat bland.  The Zeppolis were the hit.  They were fluffy, light, perfectly coated in powdered sugar and done very well.    My overall expectations were not met.  Good Food and Barrington's are the \"talk\" in town so I expected more of a sophistication from the staff and management.  I would still come back but I do hope they iron out some of these kinks."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly before 7:00 and grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  After checking over the menu we decided to try the charcuterie plate, a mixed array of meats, cheeses, etc.  However, unfortunately we received the special plate which was a little bit of an array of things that we were unfamiliar with, and no one gave us an explanation upon delivery. We tasted a few things, but unfortunately the chicken liver mouse and some of the other things, still not sure what they were, not to our liking. We explained the mix up and we were able to replace it with a plate of prosiutto de parma, mortadella, and variety of cheeses and olives, more what we were looking for. We also chose the swordfish appetizer which was served with crostini  and was pretty good. Finally we went with the margarita pizza, which was probably the best thing we had the entire night. Unfortunately throughout the evening the bartender was less available, leaving us with empty drinks for quite some time.  Overall, I thought the food we tried was good, and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, However, I was a little disappointed with the overall service and attentiveness to delivery of our meals. I do look forward to going back, sitting in the restaurant and trying some more entrees, especially the pasta. It looked great."}
{"text":"First of all this could be literally the only restaraunt in NC that serves zucchini flowers... For this reason alone I showed up and Stagoni did NOT disaapoint. LIGHT, DELICATE, FLAVORFUL!! Anyone can make squash blossoms them but these were fabulous! The mussles? So good we ordered them twice. I am a very picky Italian and everything we had we enjoyed!"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I had chicken cacciatore and it was very good but at a price ($27).  My wife had a mushroom truffle pizza, brick oven baked (not wood fired) but slightly burnt.  She had a hard time finding the mushrooms and I has trouble liking it.  The cacciatore was very tasty and came with spinach egg noodles.  The Zeppoli was excellent, very light and tasty.  This was the best value on the menu and I would only return for it. The menu has a lot of items, looking pretty authentic so I guess it would be considered a REAL Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Never had a bad in experience in any way and I've been at least 10 times. The service is always amazing, the food  is ridiculous. It's a bit loud throughout the place but totally worth it."}
