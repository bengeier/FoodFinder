{"text":"I had the Salami and Leonardo pizzas. Both were superb. I really liked the spicy sauce on the Salami pizza. Additionally, Budweiser's were only $2! Cheap pizza and beer, great location in the heart of Madison in Lakewood. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"making real pizza in traditional oven! this place is rocking with different taste of pizza by different method of cooking and incidents 

must try right now!"}
{"text":"La Pizza es un Milagro.  no es broma es un milagro! Y tipo que hace la pizza es un milagro"}
{"text":"Not bad - but not stellar Neopolitan pizza. Fortunately the bar has been raised in Cleveland with Citizen Pie and Biga."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Clean restaurant. Great music.
Will definitely be working this into my normal Pizza eating schedule."}
{"text":"My review in its simplest form: I purchased 2 pies expecting to have some cold leftovers for lunch the next day, but both boxes were empty before I knew what I had done. 

My first pie was the Leonardo. It's going to be hard to go with anything else going forward. I feel like I'll regret not getting it every time I go. It's a white pie with sweet tomatoes, peppery arugula, pistachios, fresh mozz, a bit of sea salt and olive oil that just complimented each other so well. 

The margherita was also very good. It was saltier than I have been used to with a red sauce pie (with there being sea salt on it) but I found that really enjoyed the different flavor. It's just my preference, but I think I'd go with the marinara next time, just because I feel like I'd like the flavor better without the cheese. 

Overall, my experience was great. I showed up just a couple minutes after they opened, since I was in the area. I was greeted warmly and everyone working was very kind. I ordered to go, and they made me feel very welcome as I waited. I love being able to sit and watch them cook the pies in the wood-fired pizza oven, and they made great use of a cool space. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deliciously simple pizza that adds a hipster flavor to the emerging Madison corridor in Lakewood. The reggae music will put you at ease while you are mesmerized watching your pizza being prepared. Great neighborhood joint when you are craving comfort food."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. High quality, really tasty. But - service was slow and not that attentive. We waited an hour for 3 pies. Friday night and not THAT busy. I get that they're new but that's a bit long for 3 pies. 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent new little pizza shop in Lakewood! Tried both the white pizza and the marinara and both were very tasty. You can sit at the bar and watch the chef make the pizza from scratch in a wood burning oven. Prices are reasonable and makes for a quick dinner after work!"}
{"text":"I rarely give a five star rating, but this restaurant's pizzas deserve the top rating. Cooked in a similar fashion as they would have in Italy. Presentation is beautiful. The pizza is delicious. The ingredients are superb. You can taste the virgin olive oil, sea salt, Mozzarella, and tomatoes.  This is a great find."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland and my friend didn't want to eat pizza but he decided he wanted to try Harlow's and.. we both were amazed with how phenomenal were these pizzas, we got the Leonardo's and the Salami, one would think all pizzas taste the same but the flavour and the difference is remarkable, I loved the fact the menu states no changes or additions are to be made for any of the pizzas sold here, it's a great feature because it keeps the chefs signature of the dishes designed.. very happy to come here."}
{"text":"Awesome little pizza place - only a few types of pizza on the menu, but they do it right. My fianc√© and I shared one pizza, but if you're hungry, you may want your own! We sat at the bar and got to watch the staff making every pie, which was pretty cool. A very affordable date spot - we're looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of their no substitutions and no carryout policies.. but I'm definitely a fan of everything else! I love that it's a small place where you can see pizzas being made in the oven in front of you. Their red sauce is delicious! It's a nice and affordable place to grab some great stone oven pizzas. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza all over Italy and this is as authentic as it gets.  Id put it up there with Vero. Would love to put them up against each other. The limited menu means that they are focussed on the one main thing-pizza, and they nail it.  Owners are great and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"I like to think I've been around at least a little and these folks know how to do it. They keep it simple (a few, solid menu options that make it easy) and know what they are doing. 

A small husband/wife team have created a nice place to unwind, have a drink and eat a solid pie in the heart of Lakewood, OH."}
{"text":"Biggly biggly good. Quite possible one of the best pizza places in the area, possibly of all time, and trust me, I've been to lots of pizza places in my life.

Absolutely would recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza, but wish that there was more of a variety of pizzas to choose from (1 vegan, 2 red, and 2 white).  I liked their sauce.  It's too bad that it's only on two different pizzas that I would order (I'm not going the \"no cheese\" route).  I don't anticipate coming back very often unless I'm in the mood for a margherita.  Kind of a shame."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Pizza is fantastic, love the minimalist menu and atmosphere. Owners and staff are super friendly and laid back. No doubt my boyfriend and I will be Harlow's regulars."}
{"text":"Driving by this place looked interesting. We stoped in unexpectedly on a Saturday night in June. Not only is the decor perfect but the pizza was amazing. I'm sure this is as close to pizza in Italy as you can get. We got the Leonardo and Salami pizzas. The red sauce is made fresh and was the best red sauce I've ever experienced. The menu is small but everything on the menu is fantastic. The Agua Frescas offered included a watermelon and basil lemon the night we were there. Both were refreshing and amazing. They only offered one red and white wine but we were very pleased with the red they offered. The restaurant is small. I'm sure they get busy during peak hours. The lighting on the patio made it a perfect spot for an evening dinner on the patio. We will definitely return with a small group or even on another date night."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with the front window open. Great vibe! Wood fired pizza is great. Ours was a little undercooked in the center, but still tasty. Nice staff and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant! The pizza is simple and delicious, the dough is light and fluffy like a traditional biga, and the space is very warm and comfortable; reminds me of Southern California. We will definitely be back and can't wait to bring friends!"}
{"text":"Very very good Italian pizza. Makes me look forward to our trip to Italy.

Nothing wrong with not having salads or appetizers. That's just not what they do here. Not a required thing. So ignore that part of Suzanne's review.

Also they have Budweiser for just $2. That's college bar prices."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great drinks. Try the milagro tequila and Leonardo pizza. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Really great pie. 

Staff was amazing and friendly. 

Really looking forward to going back and checking out the patio."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'd never been here, it's incredible! The pizza is thin crust and each one is good. The servers were nice and they cook the pizzas right there behind the counter. It's small and warm inside and has an awesome friendly vibe. It's easy to miss, as I've driven past it many times and never noticed! So happy it caught my eye, definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try Harlow's for months now and finally tried last night.  It just goes to show that you don't need to do much as long as you have quality products.  We tried the Bianca and Salami pizzas and both were delicious.  This will definitely be in our regular rotation for pizza now."}
{"text":"As a New York style pizza snob I wish I could rate this place 10 stars. Pizza and atmosphere are out of this world as well as prompt service make this place a must try in Lakewood or Cleveland for that matter."}
{"text":"10/10 AMAZING

The decor and vibe of Harlow's is amazing. Very clean restaurant and restrooms. You can tell these folks are meticulous and love their jobs!

The food was fresh and delicious and priced super fairly. You can tell they use high quality ingredients and take pride in every detail of their restaurant and food. 

Definitely one of the best pizzas I've had - if not *the* best."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I've had all of the pizzas on the menu and I can't decide which one is my favorite! Friendly staff and good wine. Sheeeeeeesh!"}
{"text":"We biked to Harlow's tonight after hearing from friends we should give it a try. We were so impressed! The staff was incredibly attentive & friendly, we felt like regulars. I ordered an Aqua Fresca which was perfect for this particularly muggy and warm evening. Pro tip, sit on the patio! It's relaxing and Instagram worthy!! The pizza is the perfect size to split between two people."}
{"text":"Simply a wonderful new addition to the diverse Lakewood foodie scene that focuses on the art of the pizza! Anyone who doesn't understand what simple quality ingredients can create, combined with a lot of craft/skill and a lot of love probably won't understand/like Harlow's - and should just call Domino's!
Owners Emily and John know that quality is quality and you don't need a menu full of appetizers, salads, or large glasses of wine to truly enjoy one of the miracles of Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night...but saw the excellent reviews about this place and couldn't wait to try it.  It is SO cute inside, and loved the vibe, HOWEVER, our pizza was So salty that it was inedible.  We never experience that, so I am not sure if somehow the salt mixture in the sauce was too much...the crust was OUTSTANDING, though...and we will try it again... it just must have been an off night.  RATS!"}
{"text":"Really cool spot.  Clean, crisp diner feel.  Table shared with another trio but never felt crowded!  Now to the pizza....thin, crispy and just enough chewiness!  Loved the margherita and marinara pizza...no leftovers.  

Service was fantastic and personable.  Love that it is a young couple (w/ little little kids) trying to bring real Italian pizza to Lakewood.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very tasty and authentic Italian cusine, but the lack of appetizers and salad is a concern. This restaurant is a good dining choice if one is interested in a quick bite, but if one is looking for a complete dining experience , then this is not the best choice."}
{"text":"So. Good. 

It was simple, authentic, and delish! Almost don't want to brag about this place too much so that we can keep it to ourselves.  The husband and wife owners are very sweet too. Perfect addition to Lakewood!!"}
{"text":"I live in SF ca. Wanted to try Harlow till I read about it. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is better than any place that I know of in sf. The price point and comfort of the place is also a huge plus. I guess I have a new favorite pizza. Goodbye una pizza napoletana in SF, I found something I like more."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would!! Hands down the best pizza I've ever had! Cannot remember the name of the zaa but it was a white pizza with pistachios and arugula on it....flavor heaven!! I'm a real red sauce kind of person but my god this was delicious !! The restaurant has the feel of an old school diner meets, casual clean, minimalist pizza place and I'm in love. Drinks are fairly priced and service is fast. Added bonus... you get to watch the pizza master himself make everything in front of you."}
{"text":"Outside of Naples, Italy this is some of the best Napoleon pizza you can find. Menu is limited, it's true. But that's what makes it so amazing - they are perfect at what they offer. The owner makes your order fresh in front of ya. The vibe is so much fun. The alcohol choices are also limited... and so is the seating... but like I said, it's all worth it. Next time I'm craving a Napoleon style pizza but don't feel like catching a flight to Italy, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love a good pizza, and this is great pizza. I'm normally pretty picky and I let my husband pick dinner tonight, normally something I'll regret, but tonight he has my blessing. This place is amazzzing. Thank you for giving me a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Must visit!  Incredible Neapolitan style pizza.  Super chill atmosphere.  Delicious freshly made juices and nice drink selection.  Might be the best pizza in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my new favorite places in Lakewood. The boyfriend and I had been excited to check this place out since they put up there pink neon sign.  
Family owned. Wonderful staff. Amazing pizza. Love the small bar list. 
This will definitely become a regular haunt for us.  

Congrats on a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Love the simplicity of this place. Pizza is straightforward good in the Naples style. Beverage choice is same. Environment is open, fun and crisp new. Love the ownership working and available. Very nice folks. The  taste was fresh and reminiscent of Italy with the thin crust. Dough was tasty and ingredients fresh. We will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Simplicity at its finest. Awesome Italian style wood-brick oven pizza for a quick stop. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint, personal. So personal the owner is the one cooking your pizzas... He was back there working his tail off. As paying patrons, we see you & appreciate you!! Not only was the service amazing, but best homemade pizza I've ever tasted. We got the Bianca, Salami, and Marinara pizzas... 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Soooo why has it taken so long to check this place out? Everything from the decor, to the story and best of all the pizza, is absolutely amazing. This husband and wife duo really took the time and money to invest in something great that shows pride.

Upon entering, on a nice warm evening - you'll see a stack of sliding windows opened for a outside/inside feel. The bar fits about 10-12 patrons and there is picnic style tables. Though the place is small, it's so clean and minimal. The southwestern decor and vibes from the coral walls and aqua knock knacks gives you comfort and calmness. There is also a patio in the back that I can't wait to check out sometime!

Both times we have been we have sat at the bar. The menu is minimal and they ask for no substitutions. I ordered the lemon basil Agua Fresca with booze(vodka) and it was so refreshing and delicious! 

The wood fired pizzas - the best wood fired pizzas I have ever had. The cook does the dough and everything by hand. It's so fresh and so delish. I have tried the margherita, salami and Leonardo. All really really good! But the salami takes the cake so far! 

Can't wait to come back and try the next pizza!"}
{"text":"They are great! I tend to be very picky. So I am glad my girlfriend decided on us eating at Harlows. It's just pizza and it's done right. I was craving it the next week so I went by myself and sat at the bar top. Definately a great addition to Lakewood."}
{"text":"Five stars for this pizza place.

We really love thin pizzas, with our current fave was Vero on the east side.
Nope, now our fave is Harlow's.

We walked in on a Friday night and were seated right away. After we sat down, three other young couples with their babies walked in, and we ended up sharing a table with our baby boys looking at each other. At least it's definitely family friendly!

They have a wooden stove and the pizzas are made right there. We ordered the margarita and the leonardo (note-these are thin pizzas with no meat, so meat lovers, just be warned! We don't care though).

Both came out just so perfect- not too oily, right amount of crispness, and with bold flavors. \"WHOA, this is good!!!!\" we said to ourselves. Our baby seemed to be in agreement too (or was just hitting his hands on the table).

Our favorite though had to be the Leonardo. The pistachios with the fresh mozzarella and the arugula were such a great combination. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.

I also was impressed how clean this place was. Usually pizza places have crumbs all over, but they really keep this restaurant super clean.

We would definitely come back- especially in our current state of life (need fast, quick hipster meal in a place that is baby friendly). Plus the pizza was so amazing too!"}
{"text":"Harlow's serves up a simple, thin crust pizza that gives you that real authentic Italian feel. They have a limited menu (a handful of pizzas and drinks, no substitutions allowed), but you are bound to get a good pie no matter what. My girlfriend and I got 2 pizzas (the margherita and the bianca), ate both, and left feeling satisfied without being stuffed. The pizza has a great, clean taste while staying light and fresh. The interior is just as fun and bright as the pizzas with a New Mexico feel (cacti and animal skulls with peach painted walls) and has a large front window they keep open when the weather is nice. Definitely stop by when you're looking for a nice light pizza."}
{"text":"This building used to be a karate studio. The building is very unique and always appealed to me. It is now a classic Neapolitan pizza place. The pizza is excellent. It is nice to not have to drive to the east side for Crostatas or Vero for a good pie. I highly recommend coming to Harlow's. Happy to see Madison being developed with great businesses like this instead of empty karate studios."}
{"text":"Wow, the Margherita pizza is the best I've ever had. Simple well chosen fresh ingredients. Perfect balance of spices with a smooth creamy texture, light digestible crust. Amazing! Bellissima."}
