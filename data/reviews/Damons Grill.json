{"text":"Tried taking my Dad for a birthday lunch at 11:30am on a Sunday (says it opens at 11am).  Doors locked. Phone keeps ringing, but no answer or even a machine.  Is it even open anymore??"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink while waiting to meet up with friends. Handful of people at the bar but not busy at all. Sat at the bar for a few minutes while a woman bartender ignored me. A Guy came out finally and asked for my drink order. Almost seemed like I was annoying him by being there. Not friendly service at all. Will not return."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Took 10 minutes to get a beer. Out of ribs. Fries came out cold. They are out if fries. Still charged full price even though we ate nothing. Disgusting. Do not come here. The waiter does not give a crap."}
{"text":"No excuse for the terrible service and bad food we experienced!! It was not overly crowded on a Saturday night, so we thought we lucked out. I guess people just knew what we didn't.  After finally being seated at a booth that had been open since we arrived,  our server was pleasant enough, took our order then disappeared. Someone else brought out our food, I still had yet to receive my drink I had ordered. My boyfriends food was inedible, microwaved pasta is not acceptable. Mine was so heavily seasoned I nearly chocked, still no drink to wash it down with. We asked a hostess going by to speak to the manager, since we still haven't seen our server.  She came back and said the manager was \"unavailable to speak with us\" I was shocked! Seriously!? Not even, he'll be with you shortly? He will be out as soon as he can? No.  He was unavailable to speak to us!? Our server finally came over, we relayed our issues and left. I never did get that drink.  Don't waste you time!"}
{"text":"Raw turkey burger? No thanks. 
Ordered the turkey burger & it was literally raw inside. Not pink, raw like I just scooped this ground turkey out the container raw. So. Nasty. Oh and there was mold on my bun. I didn't make a big deal but told them &  sent it back. Second try: no moldy bun (what a huge effort!) but still raw inside. I told the waiter, I'm over it, just don't make me pay for it. Manager came by the first time but not the second time. If that was my joint I would have been so embarrassed and comped the whole damn meal for that table. One of the shittiest restaurant experiences ever."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and food preparation ... Lunch in a nearly empty restaurant should take more than 1 hour for burgers and a fish sandwich. 

Food is OK. My impression is of a \"meh\" chain restaurant that is past it's prime days."}
{"text":"welp, the dream is dead. 

years ago the Medina Damons was a friday night favorite of mine. the ribs were good and i loved the wings w/ sweet chili glaze. then Damons everywhere started to close. eventually even this one on Bagley Road closed. then earlier this week i discovered it was open again thanks to Yelp. so, Danielle and i decided to try it tonight despite the less than glowing reviews. i guess i should have known.

there weren't many cars in the lot but that didn't sink in until we walked in and saw basically 7 people in the restaurant. we were seated and ordered our food. Danielle got BBQ chicken and I got baby back ribs. i also ordered some wings - Sweet Thai Chili flavor, not the old sweet chili glaze i liked so much. 

sadly, i didn't like the wings much at all. the menu describes them as crispy and breaded. they were neither. the sauce was ok but not near as good as i remember the sweet chili glazed ones.

Danielle said her chicken was fine but the vegetables weren't seasoned in anyway and the rice was completely tasteless.

my ribs were tolerable - almost good. they were tender and the sauce had a good flavor but they weren't great. my fries were covered in all the seasoning they left off of Danielle's side dishes and the tortilla soup i got was quite spicy but seemed like a canned prepared soup. nothing great.

i feel bad for the servers because they were doing a good job and were very friendly but the food sucked. and holy crap the music was loud and annoying. it was basically Now That's What I Call Music from 1993. 

i've wanted Damons again for so long but the dream is dead."}
{"text":"Ok for a soft opening. Typical ribs and sports place. Another chain restaurant with nothing particularly attractive. You should be confident that the food quality is consistent."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Pretzel sticks are really good. Baby back ribs tender and flavorful. The chocolate cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"We went even though we read the bad reviews. Glad we did. Even though its no southern bbq the ribs were awesome. We did take out so i dont know about service or smells of tge dining area. Ribs were good, coleslaw was really wet would be my only complaint. Will go again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really good. Same setup as the old Damons. Service was great as well. Signature ribs however were dry and not alot of sauce. Prime rib was way undercooked as well. I may give it another shot."}
{"text":"Love going here to watch football.  Food is good, but kinda expensive.  Service is nice.

4 nice big screens.  You can watch any game you want (except for boxing :-("}
{"text":"This Damon's just re-opened on January 14, 2016 with a soft re-opening.  I visited the second night (Friday).  The place is clean but walls are BARE and BORING.  Having worked in a restaurant before, I know the importance of creating a great first impression at the beginning.  This did not happen here.  There were a great many servers standing around because they want be fully staffed.  The food was nothing like the old Damon's before it closed.  The ribs were average, but dry.   I ordered the Prime Rib as medium, and what was served was definitely rare.  The French onion soup was supposed to be served right away, but it came just as the main entree's arrived.  The soup was warm,  the meat was cold, the baked potato was cold and only had sour cream, (the butter was missing).  They brought butter right away, but the potato was already to cold for anything to melt.  The soup was served without spoons, and when the lack of spoons was pointed out, they returned with 1 soup spoon and 1 teaspoon.  The soup was bland but had a very thick layer of cheese on top, so thick it took a steak knife to cut through all that cheese.  I did not see any manager's on the floor, just a herd of servers walking back and forth trying to look busy.  To sum up, the food, the service, and the decor are all poor.  I put the blame entirely on the lack of good management.  I live very close to this location and remember the ribs as being one of the best.  After trying them again, I will consider this Damon's as  \"Still Closed!\""}
{"text":"OK so I was not a big fan of the old Damon's, but my German business partner liked the place so when he told me they re-opened I thought I would give it a fair shot.  On a night when the Indians would take the pennant, the crowd was sparse and they had a guy strumming a guitar to piped in music so loud you couldn't talk to the person seated next to you.  We immediately became annoyed when told that 3 of the draft beers on the menu were not available. The waiter didn't even know what was available other than Coors Light or Bud Light. Bleh! We both ordered baby back ribs. They were average at best. Definitely not with 24 bucks a slab. They only had one TV on for baseball, the other screens had some nonsense garbage. The restaurant has zero atmosphere. Bottom line is there is absolutely nothing here to offer for me to ever return."}
{"text":"Nah, you good. 

Please save your heart and stomach the headache this place will cause. Greasy messy burgers, undercooked buffalo wings, poor service. All reasons why i dont see this place lasting another month. From what i got they had closed their doors a while back, then came back to live, and im upset they bothered. 

It was dirty inside, crumbs on the floor, my booth table was sticky, and when i told them they took a dirty ass dishrag out of a  bucket and cleaned it. Yeah no thanks. I need a tetanus shot now.
Servers were all very ditzy, unknowing of ingredients, i mean a simple peanut oil question is crucial to know especially with the amount of people allergic to nuts.

I was very displeased, i have been to a damons in NJ before and I liked it very much which is why i begged my husband to give this one a try. For the first time in our marriage he was correct about something lol.

Save your money and head to applebees or something."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. If anything the food came out too fast. We had Onion Soup it needed spices. My wife had mashed potatoes which also needed some kind of spices. I had the full rack of ribs which were very good. My wife and 2 kids had Sirloin steak. My daughters' steak was terrible and should have been sent back. The other 2 steaks were very good.Our waitress was also very good.. I used to come to Damons quite often before it closed the food was getting worse and worse. It seems like this could be very good with some minor tweeking."}
{"text":"My friend and I got really psyched when we heard that Damon's was reopening their Bagley location. Since we heard the news, we often would reminisce about the restaurant. We would have talks about their engaging trivia, delicious rolls, and fall off the bone ribs. When we walked into Damon's on the night of the 8th, we were rather confused. The lighting within the establishment reminded me of a rec room changing room: too bright, sad, and very revealing.  In a panic I began surveying the room and noticed that not one television had trivia on it. There were also only two tables being occupied by customers, which even for a Monday seemed a bit strange. There were three people at the bar, but they looked like are employed here and are off the clock. We were sat by our waiter, I guess when you only have two tables you don't require a hostess. There were three waiters for three tables, which I feel was a good look into the management available at this restaurant. After ordering drinks, I looked around the place so check out some of the memorabilia that was displayed for people to look at. Less than 10 jerseys were displayed in the main dining area, all encased in glass and most of them either not leveled or crooked. It was a beautiful mess, like a drunken step-father trying to win your affection by building you a shelf that falls apart constantly.

After being told the devastating news that Damon's no longer has rolls available, we cautiously order their Damon's Famous Onion Loaf. The loaf ended up being a pile of small onions breaded together molded into a loaf type shape. I don't know what was sadder: the onion loaf or the fact that we ate the entire thing. The entree we decided on was the ribs, which is something that I had fond memories of. The ribs were good, and fell off the bone. A little light on the sauce though. Things happen. Damon's was empty on the inside, much like my stomach because I woke up in the middle of the night and I had thrown up my dinner.  Everything seemed like it was cooked well, but my body disagreed with that statement.

Pros:
Ribs were tasty
I didn't have to wait for a table
I guess we're allowed to park in the Damon's parking lot when you can't find parking at Dunkin' Donuts

Cons:
No Trivia
No Rolls
Sad Atmosphere

I don't think it's a good idea to go to Damon's."}
{"text":"Any guess what this is a picture of? We didn't either! It is supposed to be salmon with a walnut Carmel sauce (or something like that). It looked like liver pate spread across the top. Yuck. Salmon was over cooked, but what else can you expect in Ohio.

The cheese burger ordered saved the day. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible food, watery drinks.  I should have known better when I walked in here on a Friday night and the place was nearly empty.  The service was pretty good...but certainly didn't out weigh the poor quality of food."}
{"text":"I agree with most these people. I got the chicken and ribs combo. The chicken was very rubbery and kind of tofu spongy like and the ribs were borderline acceptable. Not very much sauce. If I were you I would PASS!"}
{"text":"Closed since summer 2011"}
{"text":"We sat and the bar, as it was happy hour. It took awhile to place any orders. Drinks, food or just to catch the attention of the bartender as she was handling the bar and tables in the area. She seemed very new and inexperienced because she didn't know where stuff was or if I could just order plain mac n cheese. (Not with the Buffalo chicken on it as it is on there menu) we ordered a 5.00 appetizer and never got it. She never put it in. And it took 45 mins to get food and when it came out it was mediocre at best. It was cold and it seemed like most of the food was either frozen or not so fresh ingredients. 
A gentlemen next to us said his chicken and ribs were ehhh..ok. And the man next to him ordered a wedge salad and he was served half a head of iceberg, not a wedge. 
Next time, I'll pass and hit one of the many other restaurants around."}
{"text":"We had a party of 15 there today, celebrating the families January and February birthdays. We had a real good time. The service was great they took real good care of us and the food was good. The only thing I heard was the order of prime rib was a little more than med. rare, but it was real good tasting. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hi All,

One of the better ribs I have had at Damons.  Plus place inside is nicer than most Damon's.     I dont have Damon's near where i live.  In fact i cant get fall off the bone ribs anywhere but my own grill back home.  So once in awhile I indulge.  And I have to admit, this Damon's was better than most.  If i am near the area with the need to get ribs...i would return.

And the server was very good, though he forgot my soda briefly, but acknowledged the mistake and apologized.

Overall...I'll be back if the client nearby has me back.

{"text":"Have eaten here a few times with same good service. Wide variety of menu choices- onion loaf is yummy! Had a good burger- others in my group had turkey dinner and Cobb Salad. Food was prepared as ordered and wait staff was friendly and attentive. Manager stopped by to tell us about a punch-card promotion where lunch on the 7th visit is free. Not just a place for ribs. Great lunch specials on back of menu."}
{"text":"Draft beer tasted terrible. No doubt system needs to be cleaned. I switched to a different tap and it was a little better but still bad. Food came out quick but cold. I was the only person at the bar so it's not like they were busy. There is a reason nobody was in the place. They don't have it together."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were greeted half heatedly by a host.  Our server had spunk and was engaged with us in a fun way.  Nice job.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  She said they were out of fries.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  In 2016 (at the time) there is just about no excuse for any restaurant to be out of fries, there are always options!  Always!  I changed to baked potato.  A few minutes later she said they were out of them too.  We were one of 4 tables.  On a Thursday night, I get why!  

Restrooms were not fresh, or too clean.  They just changed owners, and to me, this is not a good sign.  They have a lot of work to do.  We had a Damons in Iowa, it was pretty darn good.  Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"This is what I get for making a spur of the moment decision and not reviewing the reviewers who reviewed Damon's (how's that for a sentence?!) Our decision was based solely on a distant memory of the Damon's we frequented regularly when we lived in Maryland nearly 19 years ago. 

Sadly, beyond the name, the layout of the interior and a friendly reception, there are no other relationships between the two. The first thing you are taken by upon entry is the smell. My guess is a longterm dampness, as both my wife and I acquired headaches as our time there wore on (I also think mold).  We really should have left at this point, but the memory masked reality.

The waitress was pleasant, but over our time there, was relatively inattentive. It finally dawned upon me that she was also the bartender. Seriously?! What kind of management would think that this is a good idea, either for the employee or the customer.

Anyway, my wife ordered her favorite from the past, BBQ steak salad, my son the Mac & Cheese and I their famous burger.

My wife asked for her steak medium well, which was part of the issue with her steak. The other part is, we're not sure how they cooked it. The meat looked blah and it tasted as much like liver as it did steak. She took a few bites and pretty much ended it there. My son's Mac and Cheese wasn't awful, but lacked any real flavor. Pretty much can be said about the burger. It was cooked right, but to call it famous is truly committing an atrocity against the other great burgers that can be found in this great land of ours.

In the end, our trip to this particular Damon's has cured our desire to relive a distant memory of a job well done. For those of you tempted by whatever to enter this location, we urge you to get over it and get past it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is from 3pm - 7pm from Mon - Fri. Also, when you sit at happy hour at the bar, they have half price appetizers! Who can go wrong with that? The food is not bad, I would return again in the future."}
{"text":"This location is open again, but if they treat their employees and serve the same as the reopened and reclosed Westlake location, they won't last long"}
{"text":"The server was the best part of the experience and she wasn't even that great. The salad came out first and they put tomatoes on my friend's salad after he asked her not to. Our water was empty while we waited for the server to return and ask her to fill it again. The steaks came and they were Luke warm. The butter was sitting on top and wasnt melting at all. The plates were dirty and the food was tossed on the plate without a care. They attempted to wipe the plates before they came out but, they smeared it around the edge of the plate. 

The manager came by and asked if he could do anything to make it right, which was a plus. He said he would adjust our bill and walked away. The server came back with our bill a short time later and nothing was adjusted. The server went to adjust our bill and brought it back with a 50% discount. However, we had to wait about 20 minutes for the bill to be brought back with the adjustment.

This is the first time I've been here since they reopened and I'm not impressed. This place was one of the best restaurants around and it has fallen far. We weren't the only people to complain about the experience, since the table behind us and the table across from us both complained. I'm still willing to give it another chance, since the staff attempted to make things right."}
{"text":"The prime rib was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"When my brother received word that he was going to be released from his two week hospital sentence, I decided to bid my farewells and depart for a steak, beer, & some Sunday NFL action.

Within a mile of Southwest General Hospital is this brightly displayed restaurant, so I turned in and was immediately pleased by the wide selection of TVs displaying softly muted NFL games. I knew that this would be a fine place to eat & view the sport I enjoy so much.

My highlights:

-  New York strip steak dinner
-  22 oz. Blue Moon draft beer
-  Friendly & attentive staff
-  $25 plus tip

General highlights:

-  Saturday college football
-  NFL Sunday Ticket
-  TVs of every shape & size displaying NFL football
-  Semi individual game selectors & volume controls 
-  Drink specials

This is a chain restaurant that I would willingly visit again, but preferably somewhere closer to the 93035 zip code where I reside."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, the service is okay. We waited close to an hour from are food. Their are better options out their in the area, I wouldn't waste your time."}
{"text":"In definite need of a makeover, like most business' in the area.  Food is ok....what you'd expect from Damons.  I had the mini sliders, your basic, so you'd think there wouldn't be any issues but as I find with many places that have tried to get on the \"slider\" bandwagon they miss the mark.  Very dry, as was my partners regular cheeseburger...which she said had no flavor and had to pour on the pepper.  Anyhow, it's Damons so expectations were not that high.  Too bad they failed to make that mark.  My main question is what's with the gnats flying around?  I went there a couple of times during the football season to watch games and was surrounded by gnats then too.  I swear it's not me bringing them in. LOL.  The employees and managers have to know about this major problem.  What gives?  If you do go just be prepared to swat the gnats while eating."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear this location was opening again, so we decided to try lunch there after a long morning. It was very dark and dreary in there and it didn't feel very welcoming. It definitely didn't remind me of the Damon's I used to know. Our host forgot a kid's menu and when I asked him for one, he took away my menu so we were one menu short. When I asked him for the menu back, he looked at me like I was crazy. Our waitress was unenthusiastic and lacked any sort of personality. I don't think she smiled the entire time we were there. We all ordered burgers and they were okay... Not terrible, but not amazing either. The fries were really good though! I definitely won't be visiting this restaurant again. I wasn't impressed with the re-opening..."}
{"text":"Horrifying!!!  If u like seeing people stand around counting their tips while you're waiting for a beer, this is your place."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars for pretty decent food. Here is what we got: 

NY Strip - It was good. Well seasoned, tender and cooked to order. The side of fried shrimp was not over cooked and quite tasty. The broccoli casserole side looked a bit old but tasted wonderful and so did the side of rice. 

Baby Back Ribs - They were grilled nicely, the meat fell off the bone and they were smothered in a delicious BBQ Sauce. 

Both our salads were basic but quite good and their bread is really yummy! I would come back if I lived in this state :) The place could use a face lift but the service was good and the place was clean."}
