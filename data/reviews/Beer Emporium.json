{"text":"Yes! This is a fantastic bar! Our bartender was awesome & very knowledgeable about beer, the food was good, and they have a great variety of beer. Very nice, relaxed setting. If you're debating where to go, go here.   ... Since my first review I've been back twice.  Both times the services was really really bad.  This makes me sad, but I've crossed them off my list; service is too hit or miss."}
{"text":"The overall feel of the reviews here are pretty on point. The reason to go is for the beer selection, the best time to go is for happy hour, it seems a bit too pricey for my taste otherwise. The food is overall pretty average, the appetisers seem better to me than any of the entrees that I have tried. My best suggestion is to ignore any of the things that it is trying to be, it is not a particularly great restaurant but it is an awesome bar for the beer lover, and the appetisers are definitely adequate for an accompaniment to the beer."}
{"text":"Dreadful food, insultingly overpriced beer, truly appalling service. If there's more than 6 people in the building, expect to wait 20 minutes to get your first drink. Avoid."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this week and know that I will definitely be returning many times.  Largest selection of Belgian beers on tap in Pittsburgh, and plenty other beers if that's not your style. I went for Happy Hour (4:30-6:30 on weekdays) with a few friends.  Not crowded, we were seated immediately.  Because it's not in close walking distance from any colleges, the place was not full of college students, which is a relaxing change of pace. The food is excellent, especially for a bar.  There is a keen fixation on garlic, but there are plenty of other delectable items if that's not your style.  Highly recommended: the Mediterranean nachos, Buffalo Bites.  There is even a $0.40 special on Buffalo Bites on Tuesday nights. Wait staff is nice and prompt. This is an excellent establishment and would be 5/5 stars if it was in a more convenient location for me.  But it is accessible by bus and there is parking."}
{"text":"This wasn't our first time at The Sharp Edge, we had been here probably about 1 1/2-2 years ago and we remember liking it then. This time? Not so much, in fact we probably won't be going back and definitely won't be recommending the place to our friends. The food is overpriced, the service borders on nonexistent and the food is barely mediocre. My house salad was a small bowl of lettuce, 3 marinated baby carrots, 2 beet slices, 3 grape tomatoes, a peperoncini and onions and was priced at $5.50. Plus there was a hair in it! YUM! I'll never understand why they don't leave the plate in question somewhere in plain view until the new dish is brought in. I can't help but think she just took it in the back and plucked the hair of the dish and brought it back to me. Needless to say I barely ate the salad. Hamburgers ran around $11.00. You're better off driving a few blocks further to BRGR."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, and very good desserts, especially the Belgian chocolate pudding. The rest of the food is a bit meh. Monday night trivia is always a good time."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst dining experiences my wife and I had. Service was lousy, slow. My coaster fell on floor and the Waitress picked it up off the floor put it back on the table. And the food when it came out was overcooked I had the chicken it was dry my wife had meatloaf it was also dry. Also when we are waiting for appetizer it was taking a long time so I went to the restroom and I saw my waitress with appetizer in hand having a conversation with her coworker."}
{"text":"Best beer selection, for sure! The Belgian beers and seasonal rotations make this place a gem. I'm a fan of meeting friends here for happy hour specials, there is always something here to please everyone. (Even my parents. That is saying a lot.) The specials are out of this world, check for the latest before you go.  The food can be mediocre and overpriced, so I recommend sticking with snacks, specials, and Belgian dishes for the best experiences if you're here for more than just the beer."}
{"text":"Best beer selection anywhere! Food is amazing. Great happy hour.  If you are a beer snob, this is your place. Huge selection of Belgians on draft. Huge bottle selection. Just be careful when drinking GOOD beer, it is often much stronger than what you may be used to.  The price is high. For the high end Belgians you are looking at about $10 a beer. It is pretty standard for this type of beer and there are cheaper choices obviously.  The cost is eased by their amazing happy hour, weekdays 4:30-6:30 when Belgians are half price and other drafts are a dollar off. The buffalo bites are something like $0.45 each and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I came in on Sunday with a party of 10 and the server was rude, totally M.I.A., and gave off a strong vibe that we were ruining her day. All of us ordered a drink and some food. It took forever to even order, then it took probably 20 minutes before our drinks came out. We joked that when our first drink comes out, we should order a second. Obviously, we should have, because she never came back! A very nice guy brought out the food, and we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally after we were long finished, I found her and asked for the check. She could've gotten 10+ more drinks added to the check but it's her loss, I guess. Once she took all the cards, she brought everything back in one stack (receipts and all) and just dropped them on the table. She didn't say ONE word. The beer selection is great, but the service isn't worth it. I recommend you go somewhere else or at least try a different location."}
{"text":"This may be one of the best beer places in the 'burgh.  The selection is huge, the prices meh, but I'm willing to pay more for a good selection, and if you want to swill Miller lite, well, they have that too.  The food is excellent, specials change monthly, there is ALWAYS a mussels dish, and I LOOOVE mussels!  The could stand to expand their vegetarian selection, only a couple of dishes will appeal to veggies, and Vegans may be S.O.L.  Parking is problematic.  They have a very small lot, street parking is also sparse.  If you can bike, bus or walk, do so."}
{"text":"eh. this place is just alright. the service is slow and the proportions are small. the servers was friendly, though."}
{"text":"I went to the Sharp Edge Brasserie in Canonsburg, but I assume that all the locations are somewhat similar.  The beer selection was impressive, especially the belgian list, and the prices were reasonable.  The food was also good - I ordered the roast beef panini.  I'm not sure what the difference between the regular fries and pomme frites was, but I don't think one was necessarily better than the other.  The pomme frites were just more rectangular in shape.  The restaurant also had a number of TVs so I think it would be a good place to watch a sporting event.  I would definitely recommend the Sharp Edge if you are looking for a new beer and good food."}
{"text":"I'm no beer connoisseur, but the Sharp Edge has a great (imported) selection. I really like their seasonals, for which I recommend the tasting sampler.   The food is really delicious, and is primarily Belgian in style. I don't love their pizza, but everything else I have tasted has been great. The burgers, especially, are top-notch, and I like the buffalo bites (aka \"meat candy\"). I also like the Mediterranean nachos and the fried fish--it's very authentically pub-like.   The service here is decent and friendly. It's often crowded, but most people are pleasant and well-behaved. The restaurant itself is kind of dark and the decor is in need of an update. But everything else more than makes up for this."}
{"text":"If you like Belgian beer....go here!! Don't go here and order a Coors or Miller Lite, they have it, but don't. Had the Belgian burger...awesome! Frittes..okay. Service....great!! Go during happy hour to save some money."}
{"text":"I love Sharp Edge- it's like my Cheers. Great selection of beers, nice people, good food- the bites are THE BEST. Go for the Jamaican Jerk bites. Also, really great deals at happy hour times and late night (my favorite time to go). The deal on pizzas late night is the best! The mussels are great too. I've tried them all! I think tomato bacon is my favorite. A neighborhood gem in Friendship:)"}
{"text":"I live across the street from the sharp edge restaurant and rely on it several times per month for a tasty dinner. The service varies based on how busy the restaurant is. That can be frustrating sometimes but the food is typically always spot on - what really is great about this restaurant is the number of beers that they have both on tap and by the bottle."}
{"text":"The sharp has one of the best selection of beers in pgh. The bartenders are very knowledgeable about every beer they have and can make recommendations according to your tastes. It is a great place to try new beers. As for the prices, you pay for what  you get."}
{"text":"Food was alright. One person ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was obviously chicken and not even pulled. Upon asking about it we were told that was pulled pork. However another person ordered the same thing and had a far different, correct order. The servers were not attentative and not helpful. My yeungling had an odd blueberry aftertaste.  The saving grace was trivia. We had a blast and ended up winning a $25 gift certificate which was a bonus. Not sure we will come back here next year."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! They should pay people to go there Service awful. Food awful! Beer warm! Omg how does this shit hole stay in business. The people who work there are rude & disrespectful to customers. Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. In fact so bad I'm going through report to bbb"}
{"text":"They have a beer list as long as my arm, but they're not the only place in town with a massive selection.  (Maybe for the Belgians, but it's not my favorite style...)  They have a pretty diverse food menu, but what I've had has been almost uniformly over-cooked, almost to the point of inedibility.  (I have more than once ordered a burger medium-rare and gotten a grey disk just this side of hockey-puck.)  I've never eaten at the bar, but the waitresses I've had in the back room have been almost uniformly incompetent and uninformed.  If you're working at a restaurant whose selling point is the beer selection, shouldn't you be familiar with and able to make recommendations about the beers to be selected from?  Waitstaff I've had haven't been."}
{"text":"If you live in the city of Pittsburgh The Sharp Edge is an absolute must try. I think this place is so awesome! Huge selection of craft beers on draft. Huge bottle selection. Aside from ridiculously impressive beer selection, the food is always consistent and the atmosphere is very relaxed(which I enjoy, I don't ever like to feel rushed.)  My fiance and I go pretty much every week, usually we go for the boneless wings or a burger and fries here. The wings are awesome because of the variety of sauces you can choose from, and on Tuesdays they're just 50 cents each. All of their appetizers have been pretty solid as well.  Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Large beer selection that concentrates on craft beers but you will also find a decent selection of European beers that you will not normally find. The bar and booths are good places to sit at but everything else reminds me of an old diner.   Waitstaff is nice but everytime I come they usually forget something I ordered. When they get busy it takes a while to get your order in and to get refills on beers.  Food is very hit or miss. Their boneless wings are quite good, thier burgers are ok. But the two times I have strayed away from those two things I have gotten sick, and both times I was not the only one in my group.   In short come here for the beer and bites, but it may be a while getting your food if it's busy. Happy hour is decent too"}
{"text":"I've been to Sharp Edge in Friendship at least 25 times and I always tell myself that I'll never go back. Inevitably, some friend wants to go for their boneless bites special during Steelers games, which is the only edible thing that they offer. The service is almost always appalling and the food is overpriced.  On my last visit, I had to raise my hand and wave to get the server's attention for the bill (after about 45 minutes waiting).  That was after spending $12 on a \"pizza\" that looked like cheese and sauce slapped on a mini tortilla shell.  During one of the game-day specials (endless bites during the game), we waited an hour for our food arrive, which they dropped on the floor.  We got our new food in the fourth quarter (needless to say, it wasn't really \"endless\" and no one addressed it or apologized).  The beer options here are not nearly as promising as they appear either.  They often do not have items that are listed, so you have to pick your second or third choice.  Try Hough's in Greenfield if you want a better experience."}
{"text":"More beers in one location than I have ever seen. The Italian food, particularly the thin crust gourmet pizza, is quite good too.  But it's all about the beer here.  Guess the mystery beer and win it for free."}
{"text":"Absolutely, by far, the best beer emporium in the city of Pittsburgh. It's a world class establishment! Over 70 beers on tap, with a great selection of Belgians. I had a beer tasting here for myself and several close friends and the management facilitated everything (thanks Melody and Michael)! They supplied the Utopias, I supplied the drinkers. The staff is very knowledgeable, especially Melody, Cindy and Jenni!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interior, but the service has been usually slow. The food is decent, but not amazing, though I hear they have a quinoa burger which I'd love to try. The main thing going for them is their beer selection, which is top notch in the area, and the reason for the 4 stars. Trivia night, jukebox, and darts also make this a fun hangout."}
{"text":"We went during the half off draft special so I can't complain about the price of the beer. They do have a great selection of drafts. Unfortunately, the service wasn't that great and we were sitting right at the bar. It also wasn't that busy so no excuse. The food was just ok, I was expecting better."}
{"text":"So many imports to choose from, so little time.  I miss this place so much.  Coming here for late night drinks and appetitizers with Mark and Alisha, those were good times!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service, excellent beer selection.  I meet with a bimonthly discussion group here and they've always treated us well.  As a vegetarian, their regular selection is quite limited, but the dishes they do have are very tasty. And they have monthly specials that sometimes include good veggie dishes. (The potato pancakes during Oktoberfest are outstanding!)  According to my group, the hot wings are excellent - at least two attendees regularly order those. One woman loves their thin crust pizza. And I can personally vouch for the Mediterranean Veggie panini and quesadilla,  sweet potato fries and cole slaw.  They do a \"mystery beer\" every day, btw, and one member of the group said she always likes what they give her.  I'm a big fan of the sampler - you can choose four nice sized micro-brews and/or imports or four Belgian beers. Or you can say \"surprise me\" and they'll pick out a selection for you.  We've been going to the Sharp Edge for close to two years now and, so far, have no plans to switch our meeting place."}
{"text":"Eh, so so.  Ordered an Edge Chicken Sandwich and fries.  The bacon on the sandwich was the precooked kind not fresh and the food order took over 50 minutes for 2 sandwiches.  Then the food arrived cold.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"3 Reasons I like the Sharp Edge 1. Now Smoke Free! - yes, the Sharp Edge is now smoke free! 2. Thin crust pizza. I like the crust thin and crispy. Monday nights large pizzas are $5 off 3. Mugs of beer. Sometimes I just can't drink a big big beer. I like that I can order a mug of beer here. Never fear, you can also order big and big big beers here."}
{"text":"My friends and I stop in here late night sometimes because they have a happy hour from 10-12 on food.  Their beer selection is fantastic, one of the best I've ever seen.  I'm not usually in the business of spending $6 or $7 on a beer but this place has it all as far as brew is concerned.  The food is just ok.  The service can be even worse.  The wings/wing bites are good and are priced reasonable during happy hour.  Everything else is usually overcooked.  Unless you are a beer guru, this probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"The BEST happy hour in the 'Burgh, hands down.  One of my favorite places around, I've been here so many times, and it never gets old.  The Belgian beer draft selection is unmatched in the city, and the selection of other beers is spectacular as well.  Plus, you're looking at half off Belgian drafts, 40 cent buffalo bites, and 4.50 pesto pizzas during 4:30-6:30 on weekdays.    Food here is good.  Definitely not spectacular, but totally passable.  It's a great accompaniment to the beer.  If you're looking for fine dining, I'd look elsewhere.  However, you do get decent portions for your money.  Service is spotty.  I usually end up coming in with a big party, so that may skew my experience.  The wait staff is fairly knowledgeable about beer, and there are a few of them who are real reservoirs of knowledge about the drinks they serve.  That said, they can be painfully slow at times, especially during happy hour when they're slammed.  The decor is pretty nondescript and doesn't distract.  However, those few minor negatives can't stop me from giving out a 5-star rating.  Anyone who comes here comes for the beer.  And your desires won't go unfulfilled.  You get a great menu, organized by country of origin.  Prices for Belgians are in the 7-12 dollar range, for generous pours served in brand- and type-specific glassware.  A little high, but you get what you pay for...and remember, it's half off during happy hour!    Overall, I'd suggest this place to anyone in search of a good beer.  Just be careful...if you haven't had a lot of Belgians before, they pack a punch!"}
{"text":"Yes, the beer selection is fabulous but the food is awesome.  I had the Mussels from Brussels Sauteed with bleu cheese, mild sauce and a hint of cream, steamed in a Belgian ale.  I also ate a burger called the Belgian, which is, Ground lamb and sirloin with shallot and bacon topped with whole grain mustard and smoked gouda.  If your in Pittsburgh, you must try this place, even if you don't drink beer.  And if you live in Pittsburgh, well then Lucky You."}
{"text":"I ordered food in here & this stupid blond bartender forgot to put my order in. Then the cunt & her manager acted like it was my fault! Fuck this place! Fuck it up its stupid ass"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find this place so close to me. The Sharp Edge is a great local chain, but I hadn't been to this location yet. Great place, excellent beer selection. Staff is expert with suggestions. If you're into beer, this is a great place. I'm not sure why the other reviewers complained about the wait staff; our service was excellent on a weekday evening.  The food menu has a large selection of bar favorites, but it did have a few more interesting & diverse selections. We (lamely) decided on a pizza, next time I'll be trying something more daring.  Try it out - there aren't a lot of decent beer places in the South Hills area."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  Great beer, good food, good bartenders, awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't like beer. I have to start off with that. That said, I LOVE this place for food, especially with my beer-lovin' friends. I'm a huge fan of their Cheddar-beer soup, but I've yet to have anything here I didn't like. It can get a little loud during dinner, so if you want a more intimate quiet experience I suggest going for lunch. It's definitely warm and cozy and pub-y  in atmosphere and that's rather fun."}
{"text":"Oooooh, once again you hit me in the sweet spot, Sharp Edge!  This time I had a chance not once but twice to try many of your beers AND the food.    Buffalo bites:  Wow, talk about hitting the spot during a late night bender.  Green pesto pizza with tomatoes and mushrooms for lunch the next day:  Also a great item to ingest.    Once again, I'm sad there is no Sharp Edge in Chicago."}
{"text":"The place is good for the beer selection. The food here is whatevs. It is a great place to meet up with friends and have drinks AFTER dinner."}
{"text":"This is a bold statement, but, Sharp Edge is my favorite bar I have ever been to. My husband and I were regular Friday-happy hour-goers here when I was in nursing school in Pittsburgh (we lived a 5 minute walk away, which was also helpful).  The beer selection was amazing, and at 1/2 price Belgian drafts and pizzas for weekday happy hour, you cannot go wrong.   I have lived all over the world and haven't found a bar quite like Sharp Edge yet.  I guess I'll eventually have to move back to the 'Burgh...."}
{"text":"I was sitting at the bar one day years ago having a Belhaven scottish ale with a beautiful friend.  The Spinning Plate, my home at the time, is across the street so we walked over for a pint.  After having a beer or two, an older local looked over at the two of us and asked, \" Are you two -  IN LLOVVEEE?\"  Not wanting to offend the drunk, my friend said, \"  No, we're IN LIKE!    I am IN LIKE with the sharp edge!  The selection of imported beer, decent bar food, good friends, sports on the TV's and all of it a stone's throw ( many times I thought of throwing stones at the loud drunks from my bedroom window) from my previous abode.  Worth a stop if your in the East End."}
{"text":"Sharp Edge was one of my favorite bars when I lived in Pittsburgh. The beer selection is impressive. The location is what makes Sharp Edge more than just another beers-of-the-world drinking establishment. It is in an older part of town that is primarily residential. If you live nearby it is heaven. Even if not, it is a really cozy place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"oh sharp edge how i  miss you and your delicious treats in liquid form. a life saver on beer sustenance day. it's what i equate pittsburgh with. absolutely NOT to be missed if you ever venture into this fair town!"}
{"text":"I've been to several of the Sharp Edge locations and they all offer a similar experience.  They bring and excellent selection of beer to the Pittsburgh area (especially Belgians since that's their specialty) which is always a good thing.  Their decor is typical bar material and the food is half decent but the beer is great.  However, this comes with a HUGE price tag.  Although beer in Allegheny county in general is very high, Sharp Edge takes it to a whole new level.  Pittsburghers aren't necessarily accustomed to Belgian imports, and it seems that they take advantage of this by charging astronomical prices for drafts and bottles.  For example, I've seen a 12 oz. bottle of Achel for $15 bucks!  I've got the same bottle for $3 bucks at a Total Wine in Virginia.    I also believe I've seen Chimay around $10 bucks for a draft as well.  You can pick up a bomber of Chimay in nearly any Whole Foods outside of the state for less than $10 bucks.  Even though it IS a trappist beer, it's widely available and the prices for it are a fraction to what Sharp Edge is charging.  I commend Sharp Edge for bringing great Belgian beer to the attention of the Pittsburgh area.  However, at the same time I loathe the fact they're basically exploiting people's lack of beer (and beer price) knowledge.  Come here for great beer, but don't think you're getting a good bargain."}
{"text":"After walking by Sharp Edge Beer Emporium a few times while trying to find a bar, a few friends and I were finally drawn in by their gigantic wall of beer, which is anything but misleading. This place really does have an insane selection of beer, both on tap, and by the bottle, domestic and imported. In fact, there is so much to choose from, it can really be a bit overwhelming.   After looking over the menu for a few minutes, I was approached by one of the bartenders who politely asked if there was anything he could help me find. Being from out of town, I really wanted to get something here that I wouldn't be able to order at home. That being said, he was kind of enough to point out some of the locally brewed beers and pointed out some of his personal favorites as well. Taking his advice, I ordered a few different drinks, and thoroughly enjoyed each one of them.  Although I cannot speak to the quality of their food, I would definitely recommend Sharp Edge Beer Emporium to anybody looking for a nice spot downtown to hang out and have a few drinks. The employees are friendly, the space is clean and open, and the atmosphere is overall very chilled out. Make sure you bring your wallet though, some of the rarer beers can get quite expensive!"}
{"text":"Love the Belgium burger! The lamb inside is fantastic. The desserts are also great. They have a great many of beer collection! Love it"}
{"text":"Judge me if you must, but I think this place is pretty overrated. Everyone that I have talked to has raved about this place, and I've been here a few times from friends' invites. Yes, the beer selection is incredible. Yes, the happy hour deals are really good (which I would definitely recommend if you want to go). However, I just didn't buy into the vibe and atmosphere- I feel like this place doesn't have an identity or an idea of what kind of place it wants to be. Is it a bar with good pub food and beer selection? Is it more of a sports bar? Is it a manly man's bar? Is it suppose to be an old-fashion bar?  I really don't know the answer to any of these questions. Otherwise, the food is above average- but $12 for a veggie burger? Really? Again, I just don't know if this is suppose to be a bit of a higher-end restaurant or what- but you can't charge people 12 bucks for a burger (and a veggie burger at that)- particularly at a place where people are there primarily for beer. And the service is well below good. I'll go here again if a friend drags me, like my coworker likes to do, but I probably wouldn't decide to go here myself again."}
{"text":"I love this place ... easily the best beer selection in Pittsburgh.  The food is fantastic (much better than your average bar food).  The staff is typically very knowledgable and able to help you in picking a beer if you need help.  Very friendly environment and an all-around great place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"Went friday night for happy hour. The bar was already packed so had to get a table. Good selection of beer but food wasnt so good.  I had philly cheese steak and it was bit cold and wasnt as tasty as I hoped for 12  dollars."}
{"text":"This place has 40+ Belgian beers alone. If you want it, you'll find it.  Excellent selection and amazing value--other places charge much more and offer less. Don't ever change!  I have since left the Burgh, but if I ever return, this place is one of the first spots I'd return to."}
{"text":"My favorite beer place in the east coast. OK, I haven't tried that many Belgian beer places in other cities except one place in Toronto. But regardless, this place is a hidden gem, hidden because it's out in the middle of a residential area, and gem because it has such a great selection of beer. Belgians on tap are half-off during happy hours, which is clutch. They also have an extensive list of other imported beers as well. The food is also excellent - the individual pizzas are half-off along with the tap beers, so it's a good combo. I remember having some buffalo wings and they were meaty, soft, and flavorful. I miss this place so much because I'm done with school and moved out to the west coast. This is one of the only three places I miss from Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection! And the food is decent too. Now with a cavernous non-smoking room. Good for birthday, graduation, going-away, and other general get-togethers with all the seating available."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Since I've moved away from Pittsburgh a few years ago, I really miss it, too.  Haven't found something quite like it anywhere else.  First, in my opinion this place has the best restaurant style burgers anywhere.  I think they're better than at Tessaro's.  Second, this is the only place I've ever been to that besides just having a fantastic beer selection also knows how to serve each one of them in the correct way.  I grew up in Germany and am really disappointed every time I go to a restaurant here and order a good German beer and it comes in the wrong glass or way too cold.  You know, like when you order a nice Franziskaner Hefeweizen and it comes served like a Miller Lite in a pint glass with no head and a sheet of ice on top. At the Sharp Edge, they do it just like it's supposed to be served for every beer you order: right glass, right temperature, right amount of head, and they have all the best beers from all over.  If you like burgers and/or good beer, you can't pass this place up."}
{"text":"This was an unknown place for me even after living in the area for awhile, but I'm so glad I found it! Beer Emporium (also known as Sharp Edge) has a great, relaxed vibe and is a great place to grab a few brews and snacks with friends. I think the price of their beer is a little high, but there are so many options that I'm willing to overlook it. I also enjoyed a pear salad that was fabulous and unexpected from a beer joint. Definitely a must try location in Friendship/East Liberty!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood hang-out spot that features a huge selection of beer. There are several huge flat screen TV's that are perfect for watching the game. Service is friendly. Food is classic bar fare that goes well with the beer. Even though the place can get busy, you will always find a seat. Good place to try out."}
{"text":"\"Eh.\" That pretty much summarizes my visit to Sharp Edge Beer Emporium. It certainly wasn't totally awful, but I just wasn't super impressed, either. I actually visited during a special happy hour event, so I knew the place was likely to be busy when I arrived. I was half right: the back was full because of the event, but the front was half empty. So hey, if you need a place to go for a Tuesday happy hour, that's a plus. I thought the set-up and look of the place was nice enough; certainly not as nice as the downtown Sharp Edge, but it seemed clean and well-lit, so it it still had that \"nice bar\" feel to it.  I unfortunately arrived a few minutes too late for their happy hour, so I stuck to a single drink and appetizer when ordering. I loved my beer cocktail - a Lambic Sangria (which, as their menu says, is \"Raspberry- and orange-infused Lillet Blanc mixed with Lindeman's Framboise and Witterkerke Belgian Wit\"). It had the right touch of beer and was also sweet, and the blend was just what I needed that night. I also ordered the pita and artichoke dip, which though not exceptional was tasty enough. I kind of wished I'd gone full out for a burger later on, but the back was so busy because of the event I was afraid of how long the wait might turn out to be.  Unfortunately, based on the service my fears may have been spot on. To be clear, I totally acknowledge that the noise and difficulties with taking care of a large group can make any server's job harder. That said, my waitress still didn't do a good job with me. For starters, she brought me the wrong dip, despite my efforts to try and avoid this. When she came to get my order she clearly said, \"You can either get both bruschetta and artichoke dip, or you can get both bowls with artichoke dips.\" Not wanting to confuse her by saying I wanted both, I clearly said, \"I want the first of those options.\" And...I got two artichoke dips. I didn't bother asking for a replacement because she ran off so quickly and I was hungry, so I figured, whatever; it tasted fine. When I finally flagged her down later I asked for my check and a water. Got my check. Never ever got that water. I can accept one mistake during a busy night, but two? Especially when one of those mistakes is ignoring my request for water? That combined with the fact that it was impossible to grab her left me feeling disappointed with the service. And yes, I know events are busy, but that also raises another issue: if you expect to be busy, why not bring in an extra server for the night to make life a little easier for your staff? So no, definitely not impressed with this place's handling of staffing and service.  I can summarize my Sharp Edge Beer Emporium experience in a couple bullet points: ok drink selection, delicious beer cocktails, tasty enough food, really unimpressive service. Granted my night wasn't awful and I'd come back if someone asked me to join them here, but I can say with certainty that this will never be my go-to for grabbing a beer or a bite. There's definitely other more convenient and impressive businesses in the city where you can do that."}
{"text":"Very wide beer selection, including many imports on tap, decent bar food and a very relaxed bar-like atmosphere. Many Belgian beers to select from, though not my favorite from when I lived there (Westmalle). Good pizza with a very thin crust. Their salads are pretty weak. A good place to take the buddies for new beers and bar food."}
{"text":"I went there last night. Got a salad and it was terrible - wilted greens and unpleasant server. Overall two thumbs down experience. Event after i told the server the salad was terrible he didn't care about it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, especially Belgian beer. I've had better experience with the wait staff than some other reviewers. The food is only okay, but the happy hour is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Meh...my opinion's waned.  Sharp Edge is what you'd get if a Pittsburgher tried to do a Belgian bar: half-assed, tacky, a little dirty, and overpriced.  Wait!  That's exactly what Sharp Edge is!  It looks like the love child of a Denny's and a nasty yinzer bar.  Weak beer selection.  Let me explain this, because a lot of people have commented on their \"great beer selection\": compared to the average bar, Sharp Edge has a great beer selection, but Sharp Edge also purports to be a Belgian bar, and they have a very poor selection compared to other Belgian bars.  They don't serve anything that you couldn't find an average liquor store in the rest of the country.  No one would rave about the selection in a wine bar if they only served what you'd find in a small PLCB shop, so why do it with beer?  By the way, serving the beer in \"special glasses\" is the standard in Belgian bars.  This is like raving about finding Guinness on tap in an Irish bar."}
{"text":"I really want to write two reviews for Sharp Edge: one for the fantastic beer selection and one for the totally average food--a division that other reviewers have mentioned and that I'll echo here. We didn't make it for happy hour, but even so the prices for the vast types of Belgian beers were reasonable. Happy hour would bring these into crazy cheap range. The menu seemed scattered--part faux-Belgian and part Pittsburgh burger joint--and our food was tasty, though salty and heavily seasoned. Next time, I'll come for beers and grab a meal somewhere else after."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food, somewhat pricey. We've had good service there, and no serious complaints. A place well worth visiting at least once.  We really like the pommes frites and Belgian croquettes, and the Flemish onion soup."}
{"text":"If you are in Pittsburgh and you like beer.  This is the only place you need to go.  Great location and very friendly staff!  The food is spectacular!  When I am back in the burgh I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"The table service is meh, the food is okay, and the prices can be a bit steep, but the beer list is unquestionably one of the best in Pgh.  They have a huge and unique draft list.  If you like good beer and are willing to wait for service, it's worth it.  The service is always molasses slow no matter how busy (or not) it is.  I've literally sat at a table for 45 minutes with zero service when there only one other table occupied.  The waitress just kept walking by and saying that she'd be right with us.  After three-quarters of an hour without even getting waters, we walked out.  I've also been here when it was packed and still waited 30 minutes for a refill.  The only way to get good service here is to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is total shit. Beer menu is overpriced af and they didn't even have any interesting or high quality beers. I went for their thursday special \"all you can eat wings\" but it was far from all I could eat because it takes literally 30 minutes to bring out 6 wings at a time (I timed it). So if you have anything else to do during your night then be prepared to eat around 12-18 wings. Oh and their menu lists them as jumbo wings but they are actually just half wings, not sure how they get away with that. The place was busy during happy hour but the exact moment that happy hour ended it was dead because everything is so overpriced. Even when it was completely dead they still stalled my wing orders in 30 minute intervals. On top of that the wings sucked. The dry rub cajun had approximately one spec of pepper per wing and the \"hot\" sauce was more of a chipotle zest than a hot sauce you would order at any other restaurant in the city. The wings were so dry it felt like they were sucking the moisture out of my body. I am appalled, disgusted and feeling cheated out of my money and time. I refuse to even be in range of vision of this establishment of crooks again in my life."}
{"text":"Do you like Belgian beer?  No?  Liar!  Or, fool!  Either way.  Sharp Edge Beer Emporium has over 20 Belgians ON TAP.  A hefty 10.5% a.b.v. Gulden Draak Quad.  Chimay XXX White.  Piraat Triple IPA.    Sharp Edge Beer Emporium has over 30 craft draughts.  Wyerbacher Merry Monks.  Victory Hop Devil.  Duck Rabbit Milk Stout.  Sharp Edge Beer Emporium is staffed by some super knowledgeable, huskily friendly barkeeps.  One of 'em gave me free samplings of draughts he thought I'd like based on draughts I'd already ordered.  Sharp Edge Beer Emporium is a well-worn, neighborhood joint.  No pretenses, just good beer and good company.  Sharp Edge Beer Emporium sells food.  They don't need it.  I'll take a Belgian beer appetizer, entrée, and dessert any day of the week."}
{"text":"The beer was great. The belgians are each served in special glasses. One of mine had a pointy bottom and had to be set in a carved wooden box otherwise it would tip over.  I loved everything I tried that night, and they gave me a generous taste of one I was interested in. The food was just bar food but we were too busy rootin' for the pens game. Service was great."}
{"text":"I am on a fried pickle mission so this was our next stop on the memo.  We arrived on a  Saturday night, no wait, parking right out front.  I am liking how this is beginning.  We ordered the sampler appetizer plate to share.  We were only there for snacks and a beer.  We ordered:  French Fries:  undercooked and a little soggy, but they are freshly hand cut Macaroni and cheese bites:  I am not sure what my expectation was, but the bites were alright.  It seems as if they were just some breaded Kraft mac n cheese and then fried.  I am not sure if I would say that they were good, but they weren't bad.   Wings:  Average at best  Fried Pickles:  Positive - there were the slices, not the spears.  Negatives -  I felt like I was at the swimming pool snack bar and the pickles came out of a big frozen bag.  (On my 1 - bad to 5 - Awesome pickle scale, they got a measly 2)  For $23, it seemed like a little steep for the quality of the fried goodness  Go to Sharp Edge for the beer.  The selection is to amazing.  They have great beers on tap and a whole section dedicated to locals, which I enjoy.  The sample is not so great, not bad, just not so great."}
{"text":"Gigantic beer selection, but the place tends to be extremely crowded and noisy. Food is just so-so and somewhat pricey considering. Overall, it's an okay place to go but nothing exciting."}
{"text":"Top notch beer selection, and they get points for usually having one or two selections on cask.  I recognize that many of these beers are legitimately expensive, but it seems like they use their high-end, expensive selection of beers to inflate the prices of less expensive beers.  The food is decent.  Definitely more creative than most bars, and with a reasonable selection.  Also, it's usually well executed.  The food prices, however, are terrible.  Their menu consists primarily of burgers, paninis, sandwiches and pizzas.  Such things have to be fairly amazing to justify the prices they charge, and they fall well below that threshold.  At this point, if it's not during Belgian happy hour, I don't really think it's worth going.  Sure, it'll always be a great place to take out-of-towners, but there are enough places in Pittsburgh with decent beer and better prices that I don't foresee The Edge falling into my regular bar/restaurant rotation ever again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently moved into Bloomfield so last Friday night we decided to give Sharp Edge a shot. We were partially drawn here by the proximity, but the real reason was the beer. Unfortunately the good beer selection was dragged down by the inattentive service, terrible ambiance, flat out bad food.   After entering we waited by the hostess stand for a few minutes without anyone noticing us, so we then decided to take a seat at the bar. We waited for another 5-10 minutes before anyone waited on us. We were seen, but no one waited on us. As we sat there I couldn't help but notice the overwhelming smell of bleach and cleaning products, but was thrown by the sticky bar, stained disposable coasters, and dirty carpet.   We were eventually waited on and placed beer and food orders; both came in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a cheese steak and received hands down the worst one I've ever gotten. For starters they did not use shaved steak, but deli roast beef. They compounded the problem by not heating it up, the meat was actually cold. It was then topped with peppers and mushrooms that were barely cooked (the mushrooms were at that just warm enough to be soggy stage, yum). All of this was covered with slices of cheddar cheese that at one point had been melted, but by the time it got to me had reconstituted into a yellow, greasy sheet.   The overall lack of an attempt to make a simple sandwich that was halfway decent gives me the sense that no matter what I get here, it's going to be made and served half-assed."}
{"text":"The Sharp Edge is like any other bar.  If all bars had more than 35 Belgian Beers on tap.  The beers were good if not a little pricey, but where else can I get Tetley's on nitrogen?    I heartily recommend the Abbey Burger, which is half veal and half sirloin.  And while the idea of eating baby calf is sometimes a little hard, this place makes a mean baby calf.  Also had the Buffalo Bites, on the hot setting.  These bitches were hot.  Like my tongue stopped working hot.  Perhaps this was a way to sell more beer.  It worked.    However the place closed at 10 on Sunday.  And that's not cool.  What if I want to throw caution and my career to the wind and drink up a storm the night before work?  Minus some stars for that."}
{"text":"Bar wasn't busy and service wasn't great.  I don't even remember the food that I ate.  Beer was half-assed Belgium and also overpriced but I must admit that the Mystery beer was nice."}
{"text":"Sharp Edge is pretty good. If you like Belgian beer, this is your place.  Expect to pay around $10 a beer, but $10 is fair for this selection.  The food is good. It isn't great. It's more Belgian pub.  Service is alright. They do a good enough job.  This location is the Belgian beer spot for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great food! Great beer! Great people!  Craft beer selection is amazing! Can't wait for the beer festival in June!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent beer selection, typical bar/attached restaurant atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"We had a surprise 60th birthday here for my father last night. The service fantastic. Matty was our waiter and he was great!"}
{"text":"Good food (especially the varied burger selection), they have vegetarian options and a great selection of beer! Staff has always been nice and checks with customers a decent number of times during the meal about beverage refills."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places. We'll go bullets on this one:  - Huge selection of beer - You can order a hamburger with buffalo or ostrich meat.  Enough said there.  - Buffalo bites are a great thing - Tons of different kinds of beer  Only downside:  - You can drop a lot of money here without really trying.  Most of the time in Pittsburgh restaurants, I am usually surprised by how cheap Pittsburgh restaurants are. The Sharp Edge charges Chicago prices in a Pittsburgh zip code depending what you order"}
{"text":"Love the ambience, beer selection (best European beer selection in the city), and the wings were excellent. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is great for beer, not so much for food.  The beer selection is extensive and a number of them are affordable (like the $3 mystery beer) but the food. is. TERRIBLE.  Literally every single thing I've ordered here has been awful.  The wings are extremely greasy and stringy.  The spinach artichoke dip tastes like it was scraped out of an expired vat of spinach artichoke dip you'd buy at the store.  The beer cheese is disgusting.  The salsa is terrible.  The fried stuff is soggy, the moist stuff (burgers, etc) is dry.  I really haven't eaten anything here that is palatable.  Go for the beer, then leave and get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Parking can be a little tough to find! I didn't get a full meal. This was just a stop for an appetizer and a beer. It seems like a very popular place and it has a great atmosphere. I ordered the spanakopita and a blonde brew to go with it. Definitely a good choice to stop here! The appetizer has been delicious and the service has been friendly. I'll definitely be back for another brew sometime!"}
{"text":"the few times I've been here, it has been memorable. So, I have to give it a five.  They will fill your growler with any beer without a hassle (vs. Otto's in State college, which is a 3).  The cask ale selection was quite narrow, in that they only had one or two, but at least they have it.  The food has been good in the past.  they would be a 6 with lower prices.    I think they would do better and be happier with slightly lower prices, more sales, and more buzz , more turnover of beer, and a more stable business model that way.  But, then it would be more crowded."}
{"text":"I dont love this place because every time I leave I feel like I've left behind the bulk of my personal wealth.  I also dont love this place because the food has gone down hill from what it USED to be, and the service is BAD.  BAD.  Pro tip:  you better decide what you want to eat and drink in advance because if you sit in the bar booth area, you're going to have ONE shot with your waiter.  And a long wait.  However, the beer list is amazing.  Incredible.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it because beer is a hobby of mine.  My favorite beer on the menu is Urbach 23, and you can't afford to drink it.  Neither can I.  Does anyone need an $18 beer?  I believe the answer is, YES, once in your life you do.  Usually on your birthday.  This place should not cost as much as it does.  I really love Belgian beer.  The Sharp Edge is the restaurant equivalent of an abusive boyfriend who isnt even cute that I love more than anything and will never break up with.  If you do get the food, try the chicken salad, it is quite good."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little story about this place...  Friday, October 20th, 2006  I invited ten of my co-workers from the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh to enjoy dinner and some good beer after work. At 1:00pm on Friday the 20th, I placed a reservation for ten people for 5:00pm. I would say that half of our group had been to the Sharp Edge numerous times before and knew only to expect a warm atmosphere and delectable beer. This view changed drastically by the end of our evening.  We had a wonderful time and everyone was enjoying their dinners and drinks. Our waitress was great and very attentive. Around 9:00pm half of our party left, leaving us money to pay their portion of the bill.  Since our waitress had to go home for the night, our bill was closed out and promptly paid. Five of us remained behind. I decided it would be best to consolidate our tables into one table, freeing a table for anyone who may have been waiting for one. At this point, three of us had had 3 or 4 low-alcohol beers and two of us only had 1 or 2. We decided to stay longer and ordered another round. Our waitress returned to the table and informed us that we had been \"cut-off.\" I laughed at first, thinking she was joking, but then became immediately confused. Our group started brainstorming, thinking of reasons why we would have been prevented from buying another round. None of us were intoxicated because we had been drinking and eating over a 4.5 hour period. We were behaving in a perfectly respectable and calm way, talking amongst ourselves. Nothing about our behavior was rude, obnoxious or sloppy. We did put some money into the jukebox and a couple of the girls sang along to Whitesnake's \"Here I Go Again.\" That was the only reason we could think of for being cut off. A friend approached the bartender, whom she personally ordered her only 2 beers from that evening. When she asked for an explanation as to why we were cut off, he informed her that it was not his decision to cut us off, and that he was acting in accordance with a decision made by \"management\" and then walked away from her, refusing to speak further with her on the matter.  If singing to one song is any indication that you're drunk or visibly intoxicated, many others should have been cut off as well. We were completely offended by such a ridiculous and irrational accusation that was coming from some unknown source. \"Management\" had not shown his or her face by this point. If we were too loud, someone should have asked or even sternly warned us that we needed to keep it down. But no such warning ever took place. We could have theoretically sat there all night, singing and hanging out without any trouble. It was only after we asked for another round that anything was brought to our attention.  We decided then to ask the host to help explain how the decision to cut us off was made. The way the host responded to us can only be described as juvenile in nature. He told us that he was \"management\" and that we had been \"sitting there too long\". This seemed an odd defense as many regular patrons of your establishment often sit at the bar for hours and hours on end.  He then told us that our reaction was typical of what he had learned in his \"class\". He insulted us by labeling us as \"classified alcoholics\" and then shook his head and simply said, \"just leave\". The fact that we were arguing with him only convinced him further that we were drunk.  Any rational consumer would have been outraged by these accusations. If I was faced with such an unfair situation at the grocery store, I would argue in just the same way; it does not necessarily mean that I am drunk. He threatened at one point to call the police. Maybe that would have been good as we could have proven to him via breathalyzer testing that we were not drunk. Either way, this was a big blow to the dignities of several loyal patrons and several new patrons.   The Sharp Edge was one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Almost being kicked-out for being there \"too long\" is an insult to me, an insult to you, and an insult to the entire community of beer connoisseurs in Pittsburgh. Those people in our group who had never been to the Sharp Edge before were shocked and offended. No matter how much I kept telling them that this experience was poles apart from what our typical experiences were, they could not accept the rationale. I can't blame them. I was much angrier than them due to my dedicated patronage to the Sharp Edge, not to mention that I constantly promote it on my own accord and bring people with me all the time (10 people that night).  After a year of boycotting the place, figuring that every good bar in Pittsburgh has a great selection of beer (especially D's Six Pax), I tried going back to the Sharp Edge. It welcomed me back. Though overpriced, I still found comfort in it's arms.  At least that prick of a \"manager\" was gone... I'd like to think because of my letter... but then again, I am just a dreamer."}
{"text":"Awesome beer bar.  I am not a big beer drinker so I have to say that this is something that does not excite me about going anywhere anymore.  All of the Sharp Edge locations are known for their beer selection, but what about the food, service and ambiance?   I have to say that although none of the above were awful/terrible/bad, I was not impressed with anything in general.  Everything was meh at best.  The service was nothing great.  Just basic, no personality.  Not that they were bad, but they certainly were not friendly, attentive or helpful.  The food was nothing to write home about either... basic bar food in my opinion which makes me have minimal, if any desire to ever come back.   With so many other options in the area, I think they need to step up their game a little in terms of service and product!"}
{"text":"The chicken bites were really small and cold :( but the beer selection was on point. The menu looked good and I was digging the vibe, need to go back to really see if it's worth the hefty price tag."}
{"text":"Great place to go when you are creaving micro-brews and belgian ales. Their pub food is quite nice and goes well with the libations. Happy hour is a very happy time indeed."}
{"text":"Review is for bar only, not the food.  The bar has an eclectic, some would say overly extensive selection of Belgian beer.  The bartenders were... weird.  Quite odd really, they were arguing in front of us, and frankly, the one guy seemed like he had a mental problem of some sort.  The other one complained a lot about her boyfriend.  Sort of unprofessional, but these places (Sharper Edge) seem to be a Pittsburgh staple so I guess they don't have to worry too much about their staff.  I will say that the place was clean and quite attractive on the interior.  The beer selection was great if you're into only Belgian beer.  So there's that."}
{"text":"First started going to this place in '99 (when the pool tables were in the back and they didn't card very much!). I'd have to say that things have gone down hill since then (post remodel) and I don't frequent as often as I used to even though I live right down the street. A visit last night only solidified my opinion that the good days at The Sharp Edge are over.  I haven't been for about a year, but thought I'd give it another shot. New menu doesn't   list as much info about the beers as it once had and ok longer lists prices for pints. Seems they don't serve pints any more, but 'mason jars' that are merely 12 oz. glasses. Service while sitting at the bar was slow, even though it was not busy and there were 2 bar tenders. It actually became a running joke between myself and two guys seated next to me. Ordered a burger but decided to get it to go after becoming disenchanted. I had requested the pomme frites (up-charge from basic french fries. Just serve pomme frites) but discovered I got normal fries when I got home, but was still up-charged.   Over priced for at best average food, poor service and 12 oz drafts. Not going back."}
{"text":"From my 21 check-ins, you can probably tell that I've been here quite a bit since my last visit - so I figured it was time to update this review to let people in on all I know about this place. As I tell people at the elite events, many times over apparently, I live literally \"this close\" to the sharp edge, so I go fairly often - at least once a week. Sharp Edge recently underwent a makeover - Enter and you're greeted with a large L-shaped bar, a sectioned off seating area to the right, and a large expansion in the back which is also seating. It can get crowded at times, but if you're only two-people deep you can pretty much walk in whenever.  First thing's first: Sharp Edge is expensive for what it is. Beers here are definitely on the high end($5+ is the minimum, $8-11 is the upper end) and the food is generally over $10. While I think the beer can be worth it, especially if you make educated beer decisions(Hint: That $6 Magic Hat probably isn't on the 'good-buy' list) - the food leaves to be desired for what you're spending. I've found the service to be spotty at worst, good at best. The bar has great service when they get around to you, and to an extent same with the servers - but it seems slightly inconsistent that some servers are a cut above the others.  Something magical happens to Sharp Edge a few times a week that catapults this place into Pittsburgh's best spots. Every night after 10pm, Sharp Edge has a late-night menu where many appetizers are half off, including large pizzas and some other times. That means that you can get their amazing Mediterranean nachos(seriously, these are worth it) for about $5, a large pizza for $6, 'frites' for $3.50, and what I just learned tonight, the $0.45 boneless wing bites also come in a tofu version.. That's right vegetarians, nearly the entire late-night specials menu has at least a vegetarian option. Can't go without the chicken? They choose natural stuff from Ohio.  As if the food deals weren't enough to entice you, every wednesday all day, all craft beers are half off(Bringing them down to about $3-$4 each). Can't make it in on a Wednesday, you say? Why not stop in for happy hour - Half off belgians make them cheap by comparison($4-5 each). Unfortunately, they do their happy hour a half hour early - 4:30-6:30. If that's too early for you, stop in any time and enjoy their Mystery Draft. This is one of my favorite things about this place - a beer that you order without knowing what it is. At only $3.50, it's the cheapest on the menu - usually something good too. How do you know what it is? Come in after the keg is kicked and they'll write down the last one on a chalk-board. For example, the last Mystery Beer was a Peak Organic IPA.  This place can get crowded, but if you're brave enough to come during a Steelers game they also have specials for that. The mystery drafts go down to $0.86 each if Hines Ward scores, along with a handful of other deals.  All in all, Sharp Edge excels if you know when to come. I find myself in here almost every wednesday, at least, but sometimes more. If you come thursday at 7:30, be prepared to be underwhelmed, but the Sharp Edge is a great neighborhood bar with an excellent and often-changing beer selection that you can come out ahead at if you plan it right."}
{"text":"nice place, nice people, great beer; bad neighborhood, you will almost definitely have hair in your food; its happened to me 3 times; how does that happen???????????"}
{"text":"Arrived for a party of 7 adults and 2 children at 1:20. At 2:26 the waitress told us one member of a party could not have a Belgium Burger, because there were only 3 burgers and 2 were unthawed and the other one was frozen, which would take longer. So they haven't even started cooking our meals, yet? One member of the group changed their order to accommodate the long wait.   The drinks were good but pricey and also took forever to arrive. The restaurant was not busy, so I'm not sure what the issue was.  When the food did finally arrive... One person sent theirs back and refused to eat. Two others were very hungry at this point so they ate half and hid the rest under the napkin.   If the service was awful, the food could have made up for it. When the checks came out they were wrong, but we were eager to leave.  Tip for owners and management. We weren't shy about our experience to the staff and no one from management ever came to speak to us. No discount was given or apology.   Pretty crappy experience."}
{"text":"We had a very large party here not too long ago, and I have to say how impressed I was with the service.  You can't expect something sleek and modern and super trendy if you go to a place like this, but my husband and I thought it was perfect.  They were the only restaurant/bar in Pittsburgh willing to give us a whole room with no minimum bar tab or extra cost.  The service was wonderful - everyone had full glasses all night because the server was so attentive.  She also knew a lot about the beer and was able to answer questions for us.  When some people wanted to go home and we were having trouble getting a cab, the manager called two for us and kept us updated on their progress.  The best part was that we bought a couple of rounds for approx. 30 people and the bar tab at the end was only around $300, which is a lot of money for beer, but so so so much better than we thought it was going to be.  I will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"Really REALLY good thin crust pizza. I think I may go here more for the pizza than for the beer, though the beer selection is pretty impressive. Also a good place for a game of darts, pinball, or late night drinks and conversation (and check out the half off menu after 10pm)."}
{"text":"Bad night waited ten minutes at the bar no service at a pens game went to the cantina round corner watching the pens"}
{"text":"First bar stop once I got into Pittsburgh - Beer Emporium!!! They have a decent selection of Belgian beers on tap and more in bottles as well as American microbrews. We got two samplers and had the bartender  help us out with choices. I also got the buffalo bites in cajun sauce with blue cheese dip - they were kinda average, pub-food fare. The Creme Brulee Stout was interesting, very sweet and smelled like butterscotch. The rest of the beer was a big blur, I was overwhelmed with all the different types we got. Next time I'm sticking to one kind at a time.  The atmosphere is less than I expected, I had visions of Monk's Kettle-esque bar and this is more of an old American pub, leather and wood, simple. The bar doesn't have coat hooks, boo!  They have a great happy hour after 10pm on weekdays, the food menu is half-price and they twitter what new beers they get and what's being replaced."}
{"text":"I don't like beer, so this review is all food based.  However, if I did like beer, I'd probably up it one star, at least.  Their selection is phenomenal.  But back to the food.  It's good, but not great.  The one exception are the boneless wings - and I typically do not do boneless wings as a rule.  But these are actually really good.  My favorite flavor are the buffalo bleu.  These little bites of heaven are their primary food happy hour special - 45 cents a wing.  Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Seems like a good local hangout. I have mixed feelings about my experience here....  PROs: First, let me say they do have a great selection of not just Belgium beers, but others on draft as well. Also, we came for dinner and ordered the tofu \"wings\" and veggie burger- they were both excellent. I really appreciate when restaurants have veggie options, and I thoroughly enjoyed the tofu cubed marinated in honey BBQ sauce!  CONs: We waited about 5 minutes at the door before anyone spoke to us about a table. When someone did approach, they told us there would be a wait (ok, no problem), so we went to the bar to order a drink. At the bar (which wasn't that crowded, BTW),  we waited for the bartender for another 5 minutes. The waiting service was the same story. Also, although I felt like the beers were diverse and of good quality, I found the prices a little high. $9 for a Duvel is a bit high for me.  Overall, I may comeback to try again, but only because the food was delicious enough to make up for the below par service."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is exactly right. It's cool that there is a bar which serves Belgians and unique beers in Pittsburgh, but they've got a few hurtles they need to overcome. First and foremost - the decor. It was like some weird combination between Cheers, Denny's and an O'Charley's. Sort of campy, sort of 70s, sort of tacky. I'd like them to at least remodel and bring it into the 21st century.  Second, the service. Our server was  little stand off-ish, as though she didn't seem like she actually wanted to be there. Also, for last call on a Wednesday night (which is midnight, I guess) she came by at 11:55, asked if we wanted to order another beer, which we declined because we each had half a glass left. At 12:01, they turned on all the lights, started sweeping up, and pretty much shoo'd us out of there. Granted, it was the night before Thanksgiving, but there were a fair number of people there and they pretty much kicked us out on the curb. Not something I'm used to.  Lastly, I wish the food matched the beers a little more. They have your typical over-fried bar food, which makes sense if you're drinking a PBR. But when you're throwing down $6 or $8 for a beer, I for one would like something a little less greasy and a little more complex then fries and whatnot.  I get the feeling they're stuck between being a campy dive bar, like lots of others in Pittsburgh, and a legit beer-drinkers bar like in other big cities. Please, Sharp Edge, just get off the fence and try a little harder."}
{"text":"I reallllly love the beer selection here. It is epic. And I usually get good service. I've noticed that sitting at the bar is much better than getting a table in terms of quality of service and speed of delivery. So I don't sit at tables any more because of this, and that's kinda annoying. Love the buffalo chicken bites- big fan of the buffalo blue and the bbq jerk. The burgers are really good but it gets to be so pricy when it's all said and done we don't eat here very often. Love both the BBQ burger and the blue cheese one. The fries are really good too. Biggest hinderance from coming here all the time is the price. But if you are looking for a belgium beer it is awesome. Also during the holidays they have the most insane Christmas beers selection so definitely make a plan to stop there then."}
{"text":"The beer selection is OUTSTANDING.  I've only eaten here once, but the appetizers left a lot to be desired (guac from a mix, very greasy).  A bit on the pricey side but where else can you get such a selection on draft?"}
{"text":"Looks like a normal run-of-the-mill bar - but ignore the Comic Sans font on the ugly logo and the appearance and there's a DEEP selection of craft beer on tap.  Pay attention to their calendar/specials -- we came on the Wednesday night and their beer was 1/2 off."}
{"text":"This place is a literal 60 second walk from my apartment so needless to say I have been several times. Sometimes seems as though there is no one there, but trivia nights and Steelers games bring in a crowd. The food is pretty good and not what you would expect. The mussels are delicious and unexpected in the middle of Friendship. Happy hour is a fantastic deal, and they also have deals during Steelers games. Good place to swing by for a beer and a bite to eat while watching soccer/football/hockey. Food prices seem a bit steep but what can you do. Mostly frequented by me because of proximity/alcohol."}
{"text":"I haven't been too impressed with the food here -- it's ok, but I prefer to stick to the beer. If you want thin crust pizza, there are better places in town to get it.  The beer, however, is worth the price. They have the best happy hour in Pittsburgh with half off Belgian drafts and appetizers (including pizza). If you're not there during happy hour, try getting the mystery beer, an anonymous Belgian draft for $3."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I like this place but there's some glaring drawbacks that make it hard to recommend beyond 3 stars.   The good: beer selection, happy hours and specials. Half off any craft or Belgian drafts during happy hour is a great deal. If you're at the bar, they're great about letting you sample different varieties. Their bites are really good and we like that they have a tofu option at no upcharge. That said, it's a bit pricy but that's why you should go during Steeler games...all you came eat for $10. Usually a quieter more relaxed tone, which is a nice alternative to similar happy hours at places on Highland and Ellsworth.   The not so good: the burgers and other items on the menu are just \"meh\". They're good, not great and I'm never really excited by what I see. I wish they had more veg appetizers/starters/finger foods to share. As well, service can be slow if you're not at the bar regardless of how many people are there. I honestly think it's the wait staff as the bartenders are pretty quick with drinks and food."}
{"text":"Some of the best beer in Pittsburgh.  The beer festival they have every summer is great....I try to make it back to Pittsburgh for it."}
{"text":"This place has a great beer selection, especially Belgians but it's a bit pricey compared to other high-end beer joints I've visited.  The food is...forgettable at best.  I had a buffalo chicken salad.  Not spicy at all, no buffalo sauce anywhere, basically iceberg lettuce and black olives with soggy fries on top.  Ugh.    The husband enjoyed his mediterranean chicken pita thing and gets a kick out of drinking Czech lager.  High point of the night: I ordered the \"mystery brew\" which was a lovely, reddish-brown hoppy concoction this week.  Wish I could tell you what it was!"}
{"text":"The beers are very expensive but great, staff is nice and it is a good place to hang out but the food is just fair.  I had the worst Reuben ever- somehow they forgot the Rye bread.  I would stick to the wings and burgers- although the Worst and cheese plate was good -I can not give the chef any additional stars for ordering good cheese.  I also give the fries an average rating- for a Belgium themed menu they should be better.  Over all we were shocked by the bill for a corner pub but we had fun and I would go back but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. They really have a lot to choose from. I've had food there before, but the meal was really nothing to rave about. The appetizers were the best part. Also, I went there once and was recommended a beer which I later found out cost $12. I was annoyed, but the beer WAS good, just wish I knew it was going to cost me that much.   Overall, great place to try out different beers. The food is nothing special and the beer can be pricey at times."}
{"text":"Big spendin' beer snobs, welcome!  Of all the Sharp Edge locations throughout the area, this is by far the best in regards to service, selection, and since its recent facelift, atmosphere.  The neighborhood bar style and the half off craft drafts on Wednesday nights keep me coming back on the regular...(or it may just be the alcoholism)...  Though, regardless of those reasons, I feel this place may be resting a little too high on their laurels when it comes to thinking it's the \"only\" place in Pittsburgh (city limits) to offer such a variety of Belgian, imports, and domestic micro brews; and, as for the food menu, let's just say it lacks the 'gourmet' quality for which the prices call.  All in all, +3 stars for the happy/late night hour specials; -2 stars for so much potential wasted on greedy prices."}
{"text":"Sharp Edge was named one of the 100 best beer bars in the country by Draft magazine, but I'd beg to differ. A more accurate would be naming Sharp Edge one of the 100 best craft beer bars in the Friendship neighborhood within Pittsburgh, Pa.   While I didn't try anything off their food menu, their beer menu was extensive and listed a number a fairly rare items, though when we inquired to order, they were out of most of the ones that piqued our interest.   Our service was pretty lackadaisical and nowhere near the level of attentiveness that you'd expect when they add gratuity on your check for 6 or more people. I've never seen gratuity added for a bill that's only drinks, but beware that that is the policy here, and that the gratuity is added on the bill in a way that's easy to miss, squished below the sales tax. Also, I'm always one to leave no less that 20%, but just the fact our server knew the gratuity was automatic and then neglected our table for the evening knowing that she didn't have to work to get her tip kinda pisses me off.    Also, Sharp Edge is suffering from the worst case of clip art usage I've ever seen. They desperately need to hire a graphic designer. Comic sans font and the cornucopia of Windows 95 era clip art leave their menus and signage looking more than a tad sad.   If you love clip art, this is THE place for you. If you love even decent service, keeps on walking."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday and suprisingly the place only had a few customers.  Sat there for over 5 minutes until anyone actually helped us.  4 or 5 people working but all busy talking in the kitchen or looking busy doing nothing.  Finally we settled in and ordered a few beers.  A new server must have just came on because she was actually great and chatted us up the whole time until we left.  She also knew her shit when it come to beer and the products they carry.  Now this place is serious about ALL beer, not just piney, chewey IPA that every overnight \"beer enthusiast\" crows on about.  I had an imperial stout and a nut brown on cask.  Both great and made me giggly.  Didnt try the food this time but I remember it being really good from times past.  Just remember though, craft beer now has taken on crack prices but this place is a tad lower than most.  Still, we spent 35 bucks for 4 beers with tip.  WTF"}
{"text":"I heard good things, so I planned a Friday visit with my wife and son. I really wanted to like this place.  Good beer...gourmet food... what's not to like?  And, the beer selection was really good. The folks at the bar seemed happy.  Start with our waitress.  She didn't even dial it in.  Forgot to put in orders, served room temp coffee, never smiled, left the table while you were still talking, she honestly looked clinically depressed and I felt bad that she hated her life.  Other, energetic servers, walked by and asked how it was going, so at least we  had a chance to tell them what we were waiting for, which got results.  I'll bet their customers were happy.  But, even it the bad service was a fluke (which I believe it was), I have to say I wasn't impressed with the food.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from gastropub standards.  It was pretty ordinary.  The Mediterranean nachos were covered in a bland white cheese sauce (I was hoping for some tangy feta, or parmesan), the olives were the pre-sliced black olives out of a can (I would have preferred Greek olives), no fresh herbs, deep fried bread, bleh.  Not worth the calories.  The mussels were tasty with garlic and an abundance of cracked black pepper.  But no crusty bread to sop up the liquor in the pot.  The Belgian frittes were ordinary french fries that would accompany a cheeseburger at any local diner.  I'd say go for a drink, before or after dinner, but beware the high ratings."}
{"text":"What's not to like about the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium in East Liberty except perhaps for the prices. If you've ever been to the Sharp Edge you know that its beer selection is incredible. Specifically the Belgium Beer selection is unmatched in the city. Though I only took an estimate I counted nearly 40 beers on tap, half of which were authentic Belgian Brews. Now to be honest I'm not a huge Belgian fan--there are a few I thoroughly enjoy, but I find many to be slightly overrated. (Belgian beer lovers can go ahead and crucify me.) What I did enjoy was the selection of American IPA's on tap. Racer 5 made by Bear Republic Brewery was even on draft which is quite rare to see in this part of the country.  Back to the prices I mentioned in my first sentence above; they are expensive so be prepared to pull out the plastic if you plan on staying for more than one drink. The Belgian Beers range between $6 and $11 per pint while the craft beers range from about $4 to $10. Though I think the Sharp Edge gouges you a bit with their prices you really can find pretty much any beer you are looking for. If it isn't on their tap selection the beer you are looking for is undoubtedly in their bottle selection.  The staff at the Sharp Edge is great. The bartenders are quick, even during the early evenings when strings of business men and yuppies from Shadyside stop in for a few after work brews. The staff is quite knowledgeable too, I had a question about one of the Belgian beers that the bartender couldn't answer but she was quick to get a manager (this man knew more about beers and the brewing process then anyone I have ever spoken to) to answer my question.  The atmosphere is unpretentious and cozy, but at crowded times the bar area can feel a bit suffocating. Two huge flat screen HD TV's are hung above either end of the bar which makes for a nice spot to watch a game. I particularly liked how the Sharp Edge is tucked neatly into a quiet residential corner between Friendship and East Liberty. If you aren't looking for it you might very well pass by without even realize there is a bar sitting there."}
{"text":"Yum.... I was craving a pulled pork sandwich for over a week and I finally found a place that served one and at a decent price too! I ordered it for lunch with French fries. The fries were fresh cut and crispy. The sandwich was so big I only ate half and saved half for lunch the next day. It was just as good the second day as it was the first. I can't wait to go back for another."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of both food items and beers.  Unfortunately, the food items aren't at all good, and the beer is on the pricey side.  Specifics: I had some unnecessarily soggy french fries, followed by a wrap surprisingly devoid of contents.  I was left hungry and feeling a little ripped off.  The person to my right ordered some buffalo chicken bites (like boneless wings).  They were served to her cold, and when she told the waiter, he took them back to the kitchen and brought them out just as cold but with more hot sauce on it (he might have told the chef \"make it hotter\"?).  Dessert was also overpriced, and didn't match the description on the menu.  That said, the staff was friendly and they do have quite a good selection, so it might be a decent option in a large group of picky eaters or drinkers."}
{"text":"What a weird restaurant. Came here with a friend for dinner and after we were seated WE NEVER SAW OUR WAITER ever again. When he finally made his way to our table and when we tried to order drinks the man looked so confused. To the point where I had to ask, \"are you our server?\" He assured us he was, but still kept looking at us confused when we tried to order food. He was very shifty and nervous looking. The restaurant also had a faulty door that SLAMS every time someone exits through the door. It was so alarming the first few times then down right annoying after the 50th slam! Meh I'm not sure if I will ever return here again."}
{"text":"When I visit Pittsburgh I always come here on the first night of my arrival.  It has the most amazing selection of Belgian (as well as non-Belgian) beers outside of Brugges (not the Pittsburgh restaurant, but the city).  The place is usually bustling, but I've seen it on busy nights and quiet nights, always on a Friday or Saturday.  It's best to go late for the deals.  After 10pm they serve all of their bar appetizer dishes at 1/2 off.  These dishes are absolutely delicious.  I've had just about all of them and I have to stop myself each time from totally pigging out.  My recommendation is to get the Mediterranean Nachos - chewy yet slightly crunchy pita chips with Greek-style tomatoes, cheese, olives, etc.  You also can't miss with the boneless Buffalo (chicken) bites.  Speaking of buffalo...their buffalo burger as part of the regular menu is also very tasty.  *Drools*  But seriously, food is probably not what they are known for, and I don't think I would even come to this place just for the food.  People come here for the beer.  It's a samplers paradise with decent prices but truly a great range of selection that warrants a beer menu several pages long with prices ranging from $2.50 to $50+ per glass/bottle.  The first thing I order is a Leffe Brun - my favorite beer.  It's like dessert to me.  After that I pick almost randomly - closing my eyes and throwing my finger down on a delicious trappist ale.  You can also get a sampler selection, which I've done, and this is probably the best way to get introduced to new flavors and varieties of beer.  I'm not a heavy drinker but it's like being a kid in a candy store here.  It's difficult to not get uber-buzzed or drunk.  Seriously.  This place is a must if you're ever in the City of Bridges.  ---------- OFF-TOPIC:  Anyone notice that the majority of the reviewers for this place are from California???  Is that odd or is it because Yelp is overwhelmed with Californians?"}
{"text":"We rock this place at least twice a month.  Their happy hour leaves us buzzed (from just 1 or 2 high octane belgians).  The food is sometimes lacking and a bit expensive, but the burgers are pretty tasty.    Honestly, the best deal is 1/2 price happy hour belgian brews and their cheapo pizzas.  Garlic and cheese, please."}
{"text":"always fantastic beer and great food, consistently a good time and well-worth stopping in no matter what day of week, great bar to cozy up to and friendly bar staff!"}
{"text":"I love Belgian beer so I really liked this place, especially the Belgian beer samplers they had for a reasonable price.  The beer selection, including non Belgian varieties, was excellent.  I also ordered one of their gourmet burgers for dinner and it was good but nothing amazing.  This place is also good for accommodating large groups as they have tons of space.  Service was also decent and it was a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Update: I've been back SEVERAL times since my original posting. While I still feel that the place needs renovated something fierce, the food quality and service has improved almost drastically.   I totally forgot that they do a late night half price appetizer menu, which was a very pleasant surprise on my last visit. Our waitress was amazingly nice and attentive, even though she had an unfortunate table full of undergrads running her around every two minutes for something. The wings were delish, and you can't really go wrong with pizza or fried cheese wedges.   Good improvements, and this place is now back into nornal rotation."}
{"text":"The beer selection is pretty solid though the staff doesn't seem super knowledgable about what they've got. The wings are a pretty good happy hour deal but are fairly ordinary."}
{"text":"So a little secret: Sharp Edge was where I had my first Belgian.Ever. If I recall, it was a Leffe Blonde.  I discovered this little place with my buddies in college, and we were instant fans the moment we sipped our first beers and had our first bites of the boneless wings from the late night menu. Sharp Edge is a true pub - you're not going to get glamorous service or ambiance, nor are you going to get gourmet tableware or food for that matter. However, the range and quality of both the beers and food at this establishment make it an irresistible must-go every time I'm back in Pitts. So many great memories here.  First, the selection of beers on tap is generally large, especially taking in the fact that they are basically all Belgian styles. They've also got a rotating Mystery Brew, which is  less than $4 a pint, and is a high quality draft of undisclosed origin (they reveal what it is on a board when it's done). The fact that you can get Delerium Tremens on tap or Wittekerke on tap is amazing. The fact that you can select a huge variety of styles all the way from American craft brews to English brown ales to German lagers is a sign of a great pub. Their beer menu is pages long. Pages. With an \"s\". *  Note for the ladies* they used to have Wittekerke Rose but stopped carrying it a while ago. If you still want something like that, ask for a Hoegaarden and Lambic mix. It will be basically the same thing.  The food here is very solid as well, and I like that they actually do tie in beer into their seasonal items. You can usually get something like a beer-based cheese or mussels brewed in beer broth to go along with your Leffe Blonde or Chimay. Usually I go for the boneless wings or a burger and fries here. The wings are awesome because of the variety of sauces/rubs you can choose, and on the late night menu, they're just 40 cents each. The Mediterranean Pita Dip/Nachos is pretty good for solving late night carb cravings.  The service is generally always good. Sometimes you get a new server that takes a little while longer to get around, but it's never bad. They've got a main front seating area (in addition to the long bar), and they also have a rear seating area that is great for larger groups. Sometimes if you hit peak hours, you may have to wait a little bit, but it's usually never long.  Go to Sharp Edge if you're in the Pittsburgh area and want a real pub experience. It won't let you down."}
{"text":"Everyone has always been nice. The food is bar food nothing authentic. The beer is pricey but the service had been awesome I have been coming here since before the remodel.  This tells you it's the place to be. It's just a nice around the corner spot. You can go and get good drinks,food and maybe even new conversation. I love this place. It's not open too late and attracts a very nice diverse crowd."}
{"text":"I've ate here multiple times I've never been impressed with the food especially for how high the prices are the food just isn't up to par. I've ordered the margarita pizza which sucks in my opinion it's oily and had whole tomatoes instead of tomato sauce in my experience margarita pizzas have tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil on it that's it. I've had the burgers I do not like the buns they use it soaks up all the grease and gets soggy fast. The only thing that I liked are the Buffalo bites but I still think they are over priced for what it's worth they should just stick to beer."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, beer selection and food. Tried two of the Dutch beers, onion soup n wild boar meatloaf. All outstanding along with helpful wait staff. Can't wait for another trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this place with the Greater Pittsburgh Aquarium Society members after the general meeting when I am in town. I am not a beer drinker, but all the people in the group love the selection. I love the food. Everything I have ever ordered has been excellent. The service is always very good. They have a small parking lot, but there is ample street parking in the area."}
{"text":"The Beer Emporium is great casual restaurant with an overwhelming selection of beer. The burgers are good here, I also tried the mussels which were not great. Very moderate prices for the food, and a homey feeling.  The front room is more bar like with flat screen TVs while the back room is quieter and more restaurant like. Would come again."}
{"text":"Holy beer selection! Honestly, I came for the Belgian Ales but was completely blind sided by the selection of craft beers. There were roughly 60 taps with so many craft options from the Midwest and the East Coast. This Sharp Edge branch is certainly worth a stop for any beer aficionado. Its location is out of the way in regard to the other East Liberty hang outs as it's tucked away near the EL/Garfield/Friendship border.  The prices weren't outrageous. I expected super high prices based on my experiences at the downtown location.   Lastly, similar to the downtown location, I found the atmosphere to be very cozy. In my opinion, it's a comfortable place to chill out with some friends and enjoy some great beer and food."}
{"text":"Come here for the beers, not the food. 3 stars is generous, and only because of their insane beer selection. They have a great selection of Belgian beers and many other American and Imported craft beers. Their happy hour is on point with 1/2 off drafts. Their food on the other hand...I have never had a good meal here. The food has always been bad. Either overlooked, undercooked, cold, or just plain not good.  A lot of their staff aren't very friendly either..."}
{"text":"The Sharp Edge has a fantastic (if pricey) selection of Belgian beers.  They have an excellent happy hour special which you should definitely take advantage of if you want to drink more than one beer - your wallet will thank you!  Although the food is pretty decent, you really want to come here for the beer.  If you are a beer novice the bartenders and waitstaff will be more than happy to give you helpful recommendations.  Personally, I'd recommend anything by Chimay, Brouwerij Van Steenberge, Abbaye Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy, Maredsous, or  Brasserie d'Achouffe.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Solid beer selection, great happy hour deals and our sever was attentive and quick to handle requests/orders.  Check out chicken bites at happy hour."}
{"text":"I enjoy going out to tastings, but I was unimpressed by Sharp Edge. It had gotten great reviews, so I was excited about the selection. But it disappointed me, it was an average selection, and the beers were also average. For the price of tasting it was a tad high, but not astronomical, but for what you are drinking, in my opinion, not worth it. I prefer more of a selection.   The bartender was nice and seating was easy to get, but I don't know if I'd go back of my own volition."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went to Sharp Edge last weekend and had a great time! I am not a big beer drinking but the 3 guys that were in our group were and loved the large selection, especially of holiday beers. We started off with three appetizers for the table, calamari, Italian nachos and mussels. The Italian nachos were incredible! They were unlike anything I have ever had and would definitly reccommend to anyone! For dinner, I split the large chicken pesto pizza with my friend and her boyfriend. It was so delicious! The crust was crispy and the pesto was full of flavor. Our server was very attentive and constantly made sure our drinks were full. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Good variety of beer and bar food. I didn't have any beer, but ate some of the pita chips with black bean and corn salsa and guacamole (which they called it avocado salsa). Very fresh and satisfying. We thought it was half off because it was late night, but were charged full price. I guess we just missed happy hour? Shrug."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the type of food they serve. Even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther."}
{"text":"What an amazing selection of Belgian ales on tap at fair prices!  I feel like I'm in heaven every time I visit."}
{"text":"Best bar for a wide selection of beer in Pittsburgh, and a strong claim to \"Best Belgian Beer Bar in the USA\".    Good bar food, on the pricey side.    When they're busy, the service is slow.  Actually, when they have more than a small handful of folks in the building, the service is slow.    That said, it beats the hell out of the Brickskellar (similar bar, in DC) on speed of service, food quality, and variety of beer available."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with our most recent visit. Waitress was rude and the food was just okay. They recently changed their menu and it's a lot smaller now!"}
{"text":"Great wings! Great specials... Awesome beer selection. The sampler is a great beer lovers dream! Growlers to go. Family friendly during early hours for sure. Darts available large clean dining space. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Do you love Belgian beer?  Do you love spending money?  The Sharp Edge is for you!  Alright, enough being cheeky.  Yes, the prices are high.  But then again I don't go to the Sharp Edge to get wasted on cheap beer.  I'm not 21.  For my friends and I, it is a nice treat to go to happy hour and indulge in some half-price Belgian drafts.  Half price = affordable!  Yippee!!  They have food specials during Happy Hour as well -- the pizza is quite tasty and we are big fans of the \"bites,\" little boneless chicken pieces that have been breaded, fried, and tossed in your choice of sauces.  Hubby likes the Buffalo Blu best, I really like the Spicy Barbeque and the Jerk is quite yummy too.  I've also had the sweet potato fries a time or two and they always come out crisp and warm and sweet with just the right amount of coarse salt.  If you're feeling adventurous try a Mystery Brew -- the price is marked down but you don't know what you'll get until they bring it to you.  At some point each week they announce what the previous brew was.  The atmosphere is about what you would expect for an upscale bar-type place -- not too crowded, quieter than a dive, low lighting.  And as a non-smoker (while I don't begrudge anyone smoking in a bar where it is allowed), it is nice to have a drink without smelling like I chain smoked a pack when I get home.   For the most part the staff is friendly although we have had one or two iffy waiters -- not mean, but just not really outgoing.  The best ones will come by about 5 minutes before the end of Happy Hour and ask if you want one more round before the prices go back up.  :-)"}
{"text":"With an excellent beer selection and a very convenient location, I really wanted to like this place.  The service, however, more than cancelled out the excellent food and great drink selection.  We came at happy hour with a group of friends.  We expected the service to be fairly slow at first given that we arrived with a fairly large party, but as the night went on and people cleared out, it never really improved.  Even when there were only 4 of us left and the rest of the restaurant was basically empty, it was still taking forever to place an order.    After not seeing our waiter for over 20 minutes, we just decided to go to the bar and order a drink.  Of course, our waiter finally shows up when we get back and gets kind of snippy when he sees that we went an ordered on our own and accused us of taking up his table.  We would have preferred to order from him if he hadn't been standing around in the back chatting with friends.  The bartenders were also a bit condescending.  Despite the service, the food was still quite good.  We had the Belgian onion soup and split an order of the steamed mussels.  Both were excellent.  If the wait staff were up to par, we would be glad to frequent this place more often."}
{"text":"so this place is pretty cool. (and even cooler for me because i can walk there!) the food is good but a little pricier than it's actually worth. however, they do have some really innovative things on the menu that i'm still itching to try. beer-wise this place is really cool. they have a huge selection of beers both on tap and bottles. if you're a beer lover, this place is for you... if you're just a beer liker, it can be a bit overwhelming. all and all, good place to go if you have a little extra cash and/or want to try some new beer but not somewhere to go all the time."}
{"text":"This place makes me thirsty.  Just walking in I felt like incomplete without a beer in my hand.  Thankfully the large beer selection helped me quench my thirst.  The food is also good.  I ordered the blue cheese burger and was impressed - although it was dry.  Where was my ranch dressing that was in the description?  That said, the service was slow which was odd since the place wasn't packed and it was a Tuesday.  The server charged us for an extra beer that we didn't order and initially had an attitude as if we were trying to stiff her.  Don't know if that's common at this place but the situation was poorly handled by the waitress.  We noticed on the way out that there was a sign for waiters/waitresses - I hope the next people they hire are a little friendlier and attentive.  Vegans / Vegetarians = This place has both a veggie burger and portabello burger!  Also, they have tofu bites - which were good but required a little salt.    I would come back but only during the week as I can't imagine what this place is like during the busy hours."}
{"text":"Great service, nice mix of patrons... But, most importantly amazing beers and some of the most plump, tender, tasty mussels I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The French onion soup was extremely tasty as well!!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer, you take one down pass it around, 100 bottles of beer on the wall.  An extensive collection of bottled beers as well as draft. The place has a good vibe. The new bar area is great.  They had carlsberg on tap during the world cup last year (I wish they'd bring that back :( )  The late night food menu is great. Who doesn't love a sub 7 dollar large pesto pizza. The lazy man wings (the bites as the call it) are really good, especially for 45 cents a piece. The double dipper (the bier cheese and spinach artichoke dip, or the avacado salsa) is good.  Mystery beer is a good idea. For 3 bucks, you don't know what beer you're drinking but you're drinking a beer. (I have had an unlucky experience with this just once, but every other time, I haven't mind spending that 3 bucks for a random beer).  All in all a fun little place. It does not have the complete bar vibe, which I don't mind from time to time. You can catch a game here if you'd like too, they have a lot of TVs."}
{"text":"I don't believe that I haven't written a review for this place yet, seeing as though I live so close and I'm here pretty often. So if I've already reviewed it please excuse this one...  It's a pretty big restaurant but I usually sit at the bar so I can watch whatever game is on. Seating is comfortable, employees are always nice and conversational. The crowd kind of depends on the time of day, and maybe what big sports game is on as well. But it's never so busy that you can't be seated pretty easily.   I almost always order wings and Belgian Frites from here. They have a decent variety of sauces, but my mainstay is the hot wings. I've had maybe a couple instances where my wings were a bit over cooked but that's rare, fortunately. Beer selection is amazing and there's probably no point in mentioning that. Everyone already knows! Some things are pricey if you're not ordering from the late night menu or during happy hour. But I'm happy that I'm close enough to be a regular here."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night that every other bar was packed, should have been more concerned by all the empty tables when we walked in. Our server gave us menus and disappeared. He returned close to 20 minutes later and apologized for \"accidentally wandering off\". We were with friends so it wasn't a huge deal we enjoyed talking so I didn't mind too much. Well our food came out pretty soon after we ordered and my salmon was pretty good, although it was very small. The fries were your standard frozen variety. My girlfriend got these balls fried and stuffed with potatoes and other veggies. But when I tried one the center was ice cold and she barely could eat any of it. We would have told the server but he had again wandered off. At some point a woman, who looked like the manager, hurried over to our table grabbed my empty plate and one other plate, and hurried off. She didn't say anything and it was all just a very bizarre and fast interaction. Our waiter felt like stopping by eventually, around 10pm, and we asked for our bills. One of our friends had to catch the T home and it was leaving at 10:30 so we weren't rushing anywhere. Our waiter however must have disappeared again because he didn't return until 10:45 and so we not only missed the 10:30 but had to run to catch the 11pm train! I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"I give the sharp edge 3 stars despite the fact that I used to go on a weekly basis when I lived in Pittsburgh. The beer selection and atmosphere are ideal for a group, but the food is pretty average. The boneless wings are decent, but they are just fried chicken. The salads are meh, and I'd totally skip the paninis. Go with a simple burger and frites and I'd up the review to a 4.  Overall, it's a good place for groups who want to just hang out. The beer selection is tops, but despite the varied menu, the food is pretty average."}
{"text":"i cant visit pittsburgh without dropping by sharp edge.  a few times.  a day.  ive probably been a dozen times and have yet to try a quarter of their delicious, delicious beer list.  when driving across the country, i go out of my way to stop in pittsburgh.  yeah, i said it."}
{"text":"If you're planning on ordering any takeout from this place make sure you check to make sure your order is correct and everything is in the bag. My boyfriend and I have gotten takeout from here about 6 times and something has been wrong every single time. Really not a good experience especially considering how much they charge for their food."}
{"text":"First things first, no one has yet reviewed Sharp Edge for the Belgian Beer Festival in June!  110 different beers over 3 drunken hours.  If you're a poster saying you don't like Belgians...come to this festival and be prepared to change your mind.   That being said, the interior of the place isn't bad but I wouldn't call it a hidden gem inside.  Lots of taps, lots of bottles, but a bit on the expensive side, except for the Happy Hour & regular specials.  If someone knows the daily specials list, post it...I haven't been there in a while.  The pizza is great!    My biggest gripe about Sharp Edge is the service.  There is one waitress that is absolutely terrible.  I would say I caught her on a bad day, but I've had her 3 times and she's been bad every time.  If she were let go, I would give the Sharp Edge 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Three stars comes from the following--it's a two-star \"Belgian\" bar--food is not that good, honestly, and the decor is pretty much standard Pittsburgh bar fare; however it's a four-star neighborhood bar.  Great people hanging out around the bar, never fail to get in to an interesting conversation or meet someone new there, beer selection is excellent.  The bartenders are all cool and knowledgeable of the different beers.    Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"New menu is smaller, food is more expensive. It's about as expensive as you're going to find anywhere in the city that isn't a reservations-style place, and it absolutely does not justify the price. You can dress up Sysco food all you want but when the bartender admits it's the same stuff that GetGo sells ... yeah pass.   Beer selection is great, but it's just not worth it at all."}
{"text":"As I have stated before, the Creekhouse Sharp Edge is my favourite out of this local chain. However, all of the locations are fantastic. The Emporium is within walking distance of my house. It's nice to swing by for a beer and snack (chicken bites are yum!!) after picking up a few things at Whole Foods. The atmosphere is welcoming and spacious. Oh and how could I forget to mention the large selection of beer...pretty special indeed."}
{"text":"I was just having a debate with a friend about good food versus bad service. Do you go back to a place if it has lousy service but fantastic food? Or in the is case, good food and a monstrous beer selection!   So lets set the scene.  I'm waiting at the host stand and watching as people that looked as if they worked there whizz by. No acknowledgment, no \"hey, we'll be with you in a sec.\" Nothing, nada, zip. About 15 minutes went by ...FINALLY, someone came up and sat us. So not a good way to start an eating and beerfest   Annnnd then our \"less than interested in anything remotely serving related\" server came up to us after about 10 minutes. I asked about the lager choices and he muttered something about not having any lager choices. No lager choices at a beer emporium? Say what!? Liar!   I ended up choosing a beer he mumbled about that was a carmel something something beer. I wish I could have heard what the name was, but there was no way I was going to actually talk with our server. Boo!   Our order took forever to come out, even though everyone ordered sandwiches. I was so ravished and probably a little buzzed by the time my food came that I inhaled it! I remember it being pretty good though, so that was the one plus! Chicken and Cranberry Salad Sandwich is a good choice!! The one thing that's funny is that when you have bad service, the check always magically appears, and FAST!   So I'd say in the great debate, even if the food is really good, what you remember at the end is the craptacular service and not the amazing food.   Restaurants beware, you don't mess with a hungry girl!"}
{"text":"Every time we go it takes at least 15 minutes to be  greeted by a waitstaff person. I won't be going back a fourth time. Horrible service and the waitstaff just don't care. Cheese wedges not even hot and fries served cold. Nothing about this place impresses me."}
{"text":"Good beer, food and a fun time with JB & GG"}
{"text":"There are too many better places to go to.  I won't go back.  Beer selection is fine. Food is not edible. Buffalo wings are disgusting.  Burger burnt.  The cook should be fired, or the restaurant should change the whole menu because clearly nothing on the menu was good.  Each time I bite into the food I started swearing. First bite: \"F...-I should have just made  a sandwich at home.\"  2nd bite: \"F....- I should have just ate McDonald's dollar menu.\" 3rd bite: \"F...- I am full.\" 4th bite: \"F..k, I will just drink the beer.\"  5th bite: \"F the beer, I just want to go home...\" Hopefully others will have a different experience.  If i am forced to go because somebody has a sharp-edge against me, than maybe for a drink."}
{"text":"Many have said this is the best Belgian beer house in the US, and I wouldn't doubt it. It's got a huge Belgian beer menu, but it has American micro brews and other beers too - you can find Corona on the menu, but I don't know why you'd order it.  Their food is pretty good too, with burgers, sandwiches, pizza, fries,  wings, meatloaf, chicken, steak, etc. I recommend their Mediterranean nachos made with pita bread. I recommend the Onion Petals instead of fries as a side.  They do half off late night with a limited menu - but it's still good. You can go for the beer, but your friends who don't drink beer will still be happy with the menu. I would love to have this bar here with me in California. They turned me on to Belgian beer."}
{"text":"I have only been to Sharp Edge for late night, and will review it accordingly.  I first started going to Sharp Edge two years ago.  Back then we would order the entire late night menu (which runs from 10 PM - 12 AM) from Buffalo Bites and wings to Mediterranean Nachos and their Pomme Frites.  They no longer have wings (which were my favorite), but they still have quite a large selection of bar food.  They also have a large expansive drink menu.  The only downfall is their service can be on the slow side even if the restaurant isn't busy.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sharp Edge, at least in my world, was one of the first places to offer lots o' beer from lots o' places -- and they've adjusted over the years to the ever expanding craft beer biz. Food-wise...their European twist on typical bar food is always a nice change of pace. Sharp Edge is a solid \"go-to\" destination when you just can't decide where to go."}
{"text":"Beer Stop 1 ---  When I was a student at Pitt, my bar of choice was always Fat Heads. However, Fat Heads has let me down as of late so I decided to mix it up and come to Sharp Edge during my recent visit to Pittsburgh.  This was a great choice. Sharp Edge has the best beer selection in Pittsburgh - focused on Belgium beers. One thing I will say..their selection of Belgium draft are very overpriced. Scalis was priced at $13/ glass and St Bernandus ABT 12 was priced at $11/glass.   I have been to many beer bars, and this was the highest price I have seen anywhere. Oh well - I guess they can charge that because they are the only bar in Pittsburgh that has this beer.  Food? Not bad.  The service? Leaves something to be desired.  Overall, Sharp Edge has a great beer list but the prices are a tad high and the service sucks."}
{"text":"I hate almost every type of beer. That being said, my boyfriend absolutely loves beer. Sharp Edge has the best of both worlds--- a great beer menu for him, and great food for me. Their burgers are absolutely amazing-- I'm a big fan of the ostrich burger. The atmosphere is wonderful for gathering with friends after work, and even though their beer can get pricey-- happy hour is a nice way to try the more pricey beers for less. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the slow service. However, that being said, the food and beer is worth the wait."}
{"text":"A good to for our family when we're looking for a great burger and beer list."}
{"text":"I am really surprised to see that this place has a \"4-Star\" average. Perhaps that speaks to the expectations of the wonderful people of Pittsburgh. Who knows. As far as it being a premium beer and burger joint, it was just \"Meh, I've experienced much better for me.\" I arrived to downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday evening  and it was DEAD. Tried to go out and get something to eat around 9:30p, and ended up Sharp Edge as everything else was closed down.   I sat at the bar and was served by Scott, very aloof, unfriendly and he poured very weak cocktails. Not good. I ordered the bacon burger with cheese and sweet potato fries and it took about 40 minutes. Trust me, I am willing to wait for something worth waiting for but this meal was very average. I must say that the bun was fresh and toasted nicely, it had a great texture but everything else was pretty run of the mill. The fries were nothing special - just your standard sweet potato fries.   Overall, not a great first \"Pittsburgh\" experience. We're headed to Tonic Grill or something like that -- hopefully it is a better representation of what Pittsburgh has to offer. Headed to Primanti Brothers tomorrow for their \"world famous\" sandwiches. I am actually excited about that trip as it was featured on Man vs Food. I'll be sure to YELP about both experiences!"}
{"text":"I'm pissed that I didn't realize it was a serious beer bar until after I had already ordered my perfectly fine but unextraordinary blue moon, and that I was driving so I didn't get to try any of the other awesome looking options.  I'm also pissed that I ate dinner before I went and didn't get any of the huge pile of tomato, garlic, and feta pizza that was shared around me.  So I guess that this is more a review of me being an idiot than of sharp edge.  I guess I'll have to go back and try to not be my own worst enemy for a change!"}
