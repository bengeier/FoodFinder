{"text":"I seen this place before but it was never opened. everything was yummy like back home Hawaii. love the fact there is veggies to choose. now its my son's top ten spots to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The best service and food in the area... If you live in North Las Vegas area and dont want to drive to Spring Mountain to eat Korean food then this should be your place. My wife and daughter and i always try to eat here once a week. From the stone pot bim bin bop to the basic teriyaki bowl its all delicious... The juns special is for you hungry hungry people who want the best on one plate. The sides are very freshly made and the selection although small menu is still enough to have the Korean basics for you to choose from including the spicy tofu soup!!!"}
{"text":"Juns is one of my go to spots when I come to Vegas. They have great food and a great staff. I need to branch out and try more but I always get the 3 meat with spicy bulgogi, spicy chicken, and spicy pork. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a quick trip and was craving good asian food without having to go downtown.  They were very friendly and helpful and service was fast.  Food was incredibly yummy.  I liked being able to pick from several different sides and everyting was so tasty.  Wish I could eat here again soon!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"So I notice that many negative reviews have the same basic themes, the food was alright not great but wasn't expecting something amazing. On it alone I would have liked this place but the service was atrocious. When we came in the place was empty so it really should have been a quick meal and everyone would've left happy.

Things quickly took a turn for the worst when one in our party asked for something warm to drink instead of the ice water. The pushback we got was strange and uncalled for. 

When the food finally came out the bibimgookso was near inedible, they must have mixed up the sugar and salt, when we got our waitresses attention the attitude we got astonished me, it was like she was angry with us for asking her to do her job. This attitude was peppered throughout our evening here. 

Several times she downright ignored us. She got angry when we asked for refills. There was never an apology or anything that resembled good service and quite frankly ruined an otherwise amazing evening. 

I would NOT recommend this venue to anyone and am disappointed that this place has moved me to write my first ever yelp review, and in such a negative fashion. 

P.S. I would wager my life that Valentine's day is not the busiest day of the year for this small uninspired \"korean\" restaurant."}
{"text":"All about that meat jun! I wish we could pick our sides though when dining in."}
{"text":"Just not very good.  Got 2 meat combo (bulgogi and chicken).  Got home and was mostly rice.  Chicken dry and the least impressive bulgogi i've had.  If the owner/cashier would have been nice, it would have been the only saving grace but he was rude.  Too many bomb Korean places out here to come here again."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Juns a couple of times a months for about 2 years. I just wanted to say the food has gotten better recently. I especially like the lean meat they use for their meat jun."}
{"text":"I went here with my Mother n law for the first time on a Saturday evening. It's a small place but very clean. They were a bit bizy but the food was good. The service was good the one lady running the front was very nice. I will for sure be back..."}
{"text":"The food was fresh & chicken bowl had some great charbroiled chicken w good sauce- the fried rice actually tasted better the next day.Kalbi was good - \"ribeye sliced thin\" forgettable & not charred like other meats. Beef in egg batter forgettable too. Cold eggplant side was a bit spicy tasted great- 
Appears very clean
Staff is why 3 stars
Staff is untrained & cooks need to focus on job instead of joking around with a open kitchen it scares you if the food is being safely prepared - very young cooks joking around high fived another guy & no hand washing - female taking orders does not seem to cater to those not familiar with her cultures food-she was less than helpful & acted as if we ate there a hundred times & knew the menu- a good ? Would be \"is this your first time here? Let me explain any ?s you have\" ..sides in display have no sign or description - had asked about 3-4 things like what's that? What's it taste like? Is this food hot or cold? 
If you are the only Korean food in a major radius please prepare to have many other cultures try your food w/questions so you don't hv to google the side dishes to try something 
Return? Yes we would but for a to-go order & a chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food and a reasonable price.  Love their bulgogi. Just wish they were open later."}
{"text":"So my favorite place to go for Korean bbq is close until the end of the month.  I hop onto yelp and Jun's Korean Restaurant is nearby!  I ordered the kalibu plate and waited patiently.  My order was finish, played my bill, and I started working on my meal.  The kalbi ribs reminded me of the kalbi I had in Hawaii so this place gets points for that.  Would I go here again? Maybe, but my favorite restaurant is opening back soon and I'll rely on Jun's when my perferd bbq joint isn't  open."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've ever had, and the service was excellent. I wish more places had as good service as Juns."}
{"text":"The only problem with Jun's is that it is too close to my house, and I eat there too often for my waistline. I lived in Korea back in the 1970's, and absolutely loved the country, the people, AND the food. I remember the details like they were yesterday. Much of the food at Jun's is like what I ate in Song Tan and in the small village restaurants we ate in while visiting the countryside. We avoided the \"western\" hotels and restaurants, partly because
of our budgets (low ranking US Air Force servicemen), but also because we could get western food on the US base whenever we wanted. Other items on the menu are similar to Korean restaurants in Hawaii, variations on the \"local style\" plate lunch.
It's convenient, so I don't have to drive all the way to KoreaTown. Everything on the menu, and I've tried every item, is delicious. The food at Jun's  brings back memories of days past. Jun's is very informal, there are no cookers built into the tables. You can buy Jun's Kimchi & dipping sauces also."}
{"text":"All I can say is its the Best! And there Meat Jun is my Fav."}
{"text":"all I can say is WOW.  Me and my girlfriend have eaten in just about all the Korean restaurants in town and this is by far the best. Being half Korean I am pretty picky when it comes to the food and let me tell you this does not disappoint and we will be going back tomorrow or Friday. If you love Korean food you cant miss this spot."}
{"text":"First time being here. Usually, I try to be careful when I eat Asian food outside of China town. However, this place did not disappoint. 

Very nice and tender meat. Not salty or over powered. 

I did try the Spicy ramen soup, and will not really recommend.  It was good, but a little bland. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not worth it having other great dishes to pick from.

The pickled sides were great! I would do a full order of the cucumbers, really good!

I ordered the Jun's special plate. It had 4 types of meat, one of them being chicken. Everything was quite tasty! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the Best Korean restaurant in town!!!!!
I like the idea they're using very fresh produce and meats everyday. Their side dishes are made twice a day depends how busy they are according to owner.
Also I can tell from the taste. Their potsticker were home made, not bought from whole sale vender like any other place in town. Even the stock of the soup is very earthy and clean in my mouth. 
And the PRICE!!!!! you can not find the place that has fantastic food in this price.
Please try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is decent, it will satisfy your Korean kick without having to drive too far. This review is purely for the service. I'm not sure why I keep giving them another chance - I've received bad service 3 out of 3 times that I've dined in. My suggestion is if you want to eat the food here, take it to go. Or, just make the extra drive to get good food AND good service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Psy..... (Pun intended) 

A little salt goes a long way. Less is more. We ordered the jjambbong and chicken fried rice to go. Despite many bad reviews I was excited. 

Jjambbong ... Spicy seafood soup. The correct flavors were there but you don't need to put a ton of salt in it. I'd rather them not put enough salt in the put as much salt as they did. 
Heat hot soup. Cold Kim chi on top of a plastic lid = catastrophe. Thankfully they bagged the soup or else it would have gotten everywhere. 
Plastic in the soup... Maybe from the lid breaking? Not sure but I think it was a bit to big to be from the lid ... Veggies over cooked 


Chicken fried rice.... Oily greasy Fried rice... 

Really disappointing. Didn't get banchan with our order.  So that stunk too. Over all we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I will not eat here again. The spicy chicken and brown rice tasted just like Teriyaki Madness. I wasn't blown away; however my lil' boy ate every bit of his chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"One of the few Korean restaurants on the North side, but one of the best in the Valley. The location isn't great but that's about the only bad thing about this place. The food is great, but if you have time, I'd suggest dining in, the dishes come out on sizzling hot stone ware and makes it look and taste even better. Try the Kalbi, it's bomb!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered the Jun special but if you took out the bulgogi it was like a Hawaiian mix plate with out the Mac salad. Definitely better Korean in Vegas. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and value. 

Chicken, boolgogi, mandoon, and vegetable pancake were tasty. 

Service as good too. Not sure if this is normal based on other posts... I found it acceptable. And my wife or kids did not have to ask for refills. 

Definitely coming back and taking my parents."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean. A small little restaurant in a small shopping mall next to an ARMED FORCES RECRUITING STATION.. At first glance; the menu is small and simple but it has a lot of items that I like. The prices are a bit high but i think its because of the location. The Korean Food Restaurants are limited in this area. Supply and Demand; and that is understandable.

Very decent Korean Food for the area. Unless you are going to Spring Mountain...she'll do!!"}
{"text":"Here for a late lunch. Only me dinning in. The rush came earlier they said. Business must be good because they have a new haole guy working.  He's friendly but talks a lot. ...lol. He kept talking about his favorite foods and places to go and eat. This is a clean place and food consistent.  They also market their salad dressing and mandoo 30 pieces for $20."}
{"text":"Juns has the best service, I've had nothing but great experiences going there and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had no experience with Korean food but we gave it a shot. We we delightfully surprised and happy we decided to try after eating at Jun's on Craig Blvd. We have eaten there twice and it was very fresh and quite tasty. It had enough spice to enhance rather than overwhelm. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Today for lunch some co-workers and I hit Jun's Korean Restaurant.  You have all kinds of asian themed restaurants with-in a mile or so, but the area has always been lacking a good korean joint.  I ordered one of my favorite korean dishes...bulgogi, and it was very good, but lacked that normal kick that you find in most Korean restaurants.  Even in Korea dishes were much spicer, where as Jun's dishes are more sweet.  I found the taste to be more of a Hawaiian style Korean dish that reminded me of a taste like L&L BBQ.  But don't get me wrong the food is still very good and to add spice I just asked the server for some garlic chili paste and that fixed it right up to my taste.  The never ending side dishes were also a hit with my friends and also very tasty.  Overall Jun's is a great addition to the area and I will be back to try other great dishes."}
{"text":"Someday I will have to branch out and try some other things on their menu. But I am completely and utterly addicted to the Stone Pot Bibimbob. Served sizzling and hot, rice meat and veggies with a sunny side up egg on top. Few things in life get much better. Perfect combination of flavors and textures"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday lunch. There were 12 of us, so several menu items were ordered, from mandoo (fried dumplings) to chop chae (meat and noodles) and bibimbap (meat and rice).

I confess that I had never heard of any of these items before, but I sure know something about bulgogi, so that's what I got. In fact, I would guess that at least half of us ordered bulgogi, and it was a good choice: a nice portion of grilled steak served with a side of rice and a selection of condiments, including kimchi, bean sprouts, and daikon.

I am partial to the bulgogi at Komex, and this didn't seem as flavorful. But the kimchi was good and the condiments were a nice touch.

Everyone seemed pleased with their meals, so this restaurant might deserve a higher grade. But I'm just going on what I had: pretty standard bulgogi. If you're a fan of Korean food or are just searching for a culinary adventure, you might want to give Jun's a go."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. It's a hidden gem!  Glad I don't have to drive all the way to the south side for some good Korean BBQ. The kalbi is bomb. The dumplings are bomb. My kids loved the chicken katsu.. I didn't have to force them to finish their food which is always a plus!  The kimchee tofu soup was bomb!  I'm definitely coming back to try the meat jun and spicy chicken!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to too many Korean restaurants, but this one was alright. I ordered the meat Jun and it was a bit soggy compared to what I have had before. My aunt had the bibimbap and that was pretty good, but kind of bland. Overall service was friendly and very nice."}
{"text":"Very good and decent food. The chicken teriyaki bowl taste great. Bulgogi the best. Their  cucumber Kimchi also the best.   Love it. Wish they open in california."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we are craving Korean BBQ. The kal-bi is perfectly marinated and tender. We almost always order the spicy tofu soup as well. If you ask, you can choose your own sides to go with your meal."}
{"text":"Kalbi cooked to perfection! Rice is fluffy & sides are fresh. Soup is full of flavor, noodles aren't soggy. Friendly service. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Place was legit. Not your regular kbbq but food was amazing. You have to try the kimchi tofu soup and kalbi ribs. The meat was juicy and just perfect. Service was amazing also. No complaints."}
{"text":"As far as takeout food goes, this place is a step ahead of the competition. I recently tried the Jun's Special (a variety of meats) and Jae Yuk Bok Kum (a spicy pork dish). Both were tasty and had healthy helpings (rice and two sides included) for about $10/each. The decor in Jun's is plain jane, but clean, which is the most important feature for a takeout joint. The service was pleasant on the phone, and had my food ready in ten minutes after quoting me 10-15 (ON-TIME service?!). With all this said, it is still takeout, so there is a bit of a drop-off in quality, but it still was very satisfying. For those who may have not tried Korean food, fear not! Jun's is a nice and easy introduction."}
{"text":"I think I just come here just for their Meat Jun since it's hard to look for a place here in town with good Meat Jun. I love that you have a variety of sides to choose from when eating here. The noodles, sweet potato and bean sprouts are super delish. The portions are huge too!"}
{"text":"It took forever for this place to open up. They had their \"COMING SOON\" sign up for what seemed like forever. It's more like a fast food spot. There are no grills at your table. There is nothing special about their BBQ. I like their Kalbi Soup. The Sundubu is ok too. I like that they have a decent selection of Banchan to choose from. 

I'm just glad that this place is 5 minutes from my work. Another reason for me not to eat at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I love going to Jun's. They have some great food. I enjoy the variety of kim chee that's provided at your table when your food gets there. It's fast and the taste of the food is awesome. It's more like a fast food Korean restaurant, but the quality of the food is there. My only problem is the discount for Active Duty military, but the retirees don't get the same discount."}
{"text":"Solid work lunch joint. casual. reasonably timely service.

Not the most authentic Korean food. It's obviously catered to a more American palate--many dishes are overly sweet.

soft tofu and kimchee stew...hit the spot when you have a craving..but I'm going to guess has a lot of MSG in it. If not MSG, then a lot of salt. I'm always parched afterwards. 

Having said all that, though, I go back regularly because it's the only Korean joint in the area. For those with discerning palates for Korean food, I do not recommend it. If you have a craving, though, it's better than nothing."}
{"text":"When I usually want Korean soup, my mind immediately registers spicy tofu, soybean paste, or mandoo soup at Jun's! Their soup never fails! Their tofu, soybean, mandoo (handmade in house) soup are so flavorful, comforting and filled with an ample amount of seafood, protein or veggies. All entrées come with your choice of 4 refillable banchan sides. 
 
Their rice, meat and specialty dishes are other alternatives on their menu. The traditional stone pot bibimbob, kalbi and bulgogi are delicious with reasonable prices. The Jun's Special is one of our favorite dishes on the menu which consists of kalbi, bulgogi, chicken and their delicious mandoo. This plate for just $15.95 is great for sharing!

Jun's has to be one of my favorite affordable Korean restaurants that I go to in town. I was sad that their Summerlin location closed because it wasn't far from home. We were told that they relocated to Creech AFB. I'm glad that two of their other locations are not as far as Creech. 

This Korean restaurant, owned by 3 sisters, consistently delivers on taste, service and cleanliness. And these are the reasons why I continue to come back to Jun's despite the enormous choices of Korean restaurants we have in the valley."}
{"text":"The food is really good here, which is why I keep coming back, despite the terrible service I received. 

I love their kimchi soup and I order it the same ALL the time, with no beef. 

When I've ordered it to go, sometimes I get beef in it, sometimes I don't and it's frustrating because I don't find out until I get home. 

The last time I ordered food to go, they didn't even give me enough soup. I called the lady because I was furious and she said, OK well next time you come in, we'll do it better.

That's just annoying to me. 

Last night we came in, the service was good only because one of the back workers was out helping the server. 

The server was extremely rude. I don't like the fact that they do not ask which korean side dishes we want with our food. They handed us ones we didnt want, so when the server returned, I asked for a different side and he kinda got angry with me. 

The backworker was nice and patient and brought out the sides we requested. 

I'm really going to try and AVOID coming to this place, because of the service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I had the Stone Pot Bibimbob and, I'll admit, I was scared of that heat.  That dish was still sizzling long after I was too full to eat more.  The proportions, taste, textures - all well balanced and flavorful.  I'm now a big fan of Bibimbob!  Others that I've had have been okay.. this one rocked.

Hubby got the Bulgogi - and I had to have a taste also - and I'll admit to wanting to steal his food also.  

Definitely fans of this place, and so happy that we now have an excellent Korean restaurant on our side of town! =D"}
{"text":"My go-to spot! Ordering over the phone and picking up is most efficient if you're ordering the short ribs like me. It take about 15-20 mins to prepare. The bugolgi is a bit too sweet for me, but the chicken is delish! On top of that, you get to pick 2 side dishes. There a few items to choose from including bean sprouts, pancakes, kimchi, daikon, or cucumbers. The side dishes are always on point. 

When I'm feeling sick, I always order a soup from here. The kalbi soup is to die for!  The rice served here is REAL Korean rice. 

Only downfall are the hours. Not sure why they close so early! I would like for them to open until 10pm..."}
{"text":"I have been here a good handful of time and I always get bulgogi and spicy chicken plate. As a side I choose the potatoes and broccoli. I really am not partial to their kimchi but it might grow on me in time. Overall a nice place,clean,friendly, and pretty quick orders."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here almost every week. Never once have we been disappointed. He always gets Juns special and myself, the spicy chicken. Cooked amazingly every time. I also really enjoy the kimchi soup, one of my favorites. Service is wonderful too. If you're looking for a great Korean restaurant don't hesitate to visit this one. Oh and the Thai Ice tea is a must! Wish I could put more stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Jun's Special with kimchi and cucumber kimchi. I am not sure where to start. All the flavors were familiar to me, but I got hit with one wonderful flavor after another. The grilled beef was delicious, yet it took on a surprisingly new flavor with the kimchi and it became something else, still wonderful, as I added a bite of the salad. 

I am a huge fan of Asian food, but, this was totally different in an unsuspecting way. I experienced an amazing treat! This was like trying out Thai food for the first time. I am coming here again."}
{"text":"My friend, her family, and I ordered food from here last weekend and spent over $70. We ordered the kimchi fried rice, (2) korean pancakes, kalbi, bulgogi, dumplings, and side order of kimchi. We were hungry! Kimchi fried rice was okay. We expected egg in it and it was kinda mushy (wet). Everything else was great! LOVE the seafood pancakes!"}
{"text":"Had great lunch here. Friends more familiar with Korean cuisine claimed it to be almost the same food they had in Korea. Tried the different Kimchi available and was impressed with the flavors. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always good here. I have eaten just about everything on the menu and haven't had a bad meal yet. Try the korean seafood pancake yum! The bulgogi is great! I love the fish cake and tunip lunch I. Miyoung is always nice and she is always fast on her feet..Try the special you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Spicy Chicken dish and split the dish with a co-worker. The pan-chan (sp?) came with kimchi, potatoes and broccoli. The kimchi was kind of bland, and I don't like broccoli to begin with, so that left me with the sweetened potatoes that were pretty good. 

As for the main dish, the spicy chicken (for both times I came here) was too charred for my taste. I had to use my knife to scrape off the gross blackened parts that could've made up a piece of chicken on their own.. I also tried my coworker's spicy pork that taste too mushy and bland. Good thing we had the bibimbap sauce to add flavor. 

However, I enjoyed the service and salad that came with our meal!"}
{"text":"I heard very decent things about this place but when We got around to eating here it was not what we expected. The Kalbi was charred and had more fat than usual.  It's a good quick place as an alternative for fast food for lunch but I would pass on it for sure. On a positive note the rice and the spicy pork was delicious."}
{"text":"The food taste like back home in Hawaii! The woman is so nice that she remembers that my daughter likes the red sauce for the meat jun!! If you dine in they give you so much little free dishes to snack on till your food is ready."}
{"text":"This was a random stop on our way back from Arizona... and it was a brilliant choice.  I wasn't expecting much, seeing that it looks like Korean fast food, seat yourself and they bring menus to you. 

But, when the food came out..... omg, delicious! My Kalbi plate came w rice n salad w a nice sesame vinaigrette. The short ribs were fatty, juicy, and had a nice grilled sear. My hubs had the spicy pork w tofu n kimchi... awesome dish. I'm salivating thinking about this dish. I love that they don't shy from fatty meats or oversaucing so long as the flavor balance is right.

Friendly service, east parking... absolutely great little place."}
{"text":"First time here and the only regret I have is not coming here sooner... Definitely worth eating here. Food was great and customer service A+"}
{"text":"The guy at Poke Express told me about this place long before they opened. I'm glad he did cuz this place is biggity bomb!

First thing I notice when I walk in is the smell of KBBQ! The lady taking orders didn't seem to nice until I broke the ice with her and asked if I can taste one of the sides. The potato's. Dam the potatoes are good! And that's exactly what I told her. She laughed and said thank you.  I ordered the Jun's Special which came with Bulgogi, Kalbi, Meat Chun, and chicken over a mountain of rice! It also comes with your choice of 2 sides. They have all your normal banchan sides to choose from and you can see them all thru a glass window. Thats why I asked to try the potatoes. It all looked so good. 

As for quality, it's definitely there.  Everything was cooked to perfection. Jun's special has enough to share with another person and still be full. Glad there's a Korean Restaurant in the north. I'll be coming here alot."}
{"text":"The Bulgogi, Kalbi ribs, and BBQ chicken were all great. The Kimchee, and other sides were fresh. I thought the food was great, and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"We just moved to N Las Vegas. We have been stationed all over the world and have eaten in many, MANY different countries including S Korea. I thought that Jun's was very good and the service was excellent. The hubby and I shared a mandoo and we each had bulgogi with an array of sides(we think that he gave us more sides than what came with our meals so we could try a little of many different things). EVERYTHING was good. Although we did not meet the older lady (as she got a lot of negative reviews on here), we look forward to meeting her on our next dine-in. We thought the service was impeccable. 


We will definitely return in the near future!"}
{"text":"i was crving kalbi ribs bad and saw that this place had just opened down the street from my moms house and i was determined to come check it out. my husband is not a foodie like i am so to him food is food and he got the usual safe teriyaki chicken bowl...and i got the kalbi ribs and spicy chicken combo...he said his teriyaki chicken tasted very salty to him but i think it was because of the sauce seemed like just bottled sauce, my meal was good it came with a good amount of rice and a salad but the salad greens were kinda brown on the edges so i knew it had been out awhile.
kalbi ribs tasted good, and the spicy chicken was not so spicy, i dont plan on being a regular but it was ok for just din din..."}
{"text":"Combo plates are a good size but need more selection for a korean style place. Miss my long rice on the side  instead of a plate. not bad tho"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this local place for a quick Korean fix when we don't feel like spending the money or time at our usual AYCE Korean BBQ joints.  The 3 meat combos are enough to feed you for 2 meals and everything is always very tasty.  My favorites are the bulgogi, spicy pork, and BBQ chicken.  The staff is also super friendly and you can get all the banchan you want if you eat in.  If you order to go, you only get 2 choices per entrée."}
{"text":"Went to Jun's for a an early dinner and got the ramen, bulgogi and spicy pork. Not much seating--it does kind of remind of fast-food seating.The waitress was quick to get my order. Food is REALLY salty but the bulgolgi was tasty and the vlbest of the order. The ramen was great. Although it's great to be able to choose the side dishes, they were dried out and I don't know how long they sat in a bin before being served."}
{"text":"Great find! Very good authentic Korean food.  We had beef and chicken bulgogi. Both dishes were presented well and tasted great. Korean tea was a little weak. Otherwise, it was a great find. Very affordable and we will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fast Korean food.  Had the Dosult BiBimbop.  A little too much rice and not enough veggies.  I'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I used to swear by this establishment.  However, I have been here twice recently and each time I asked myself why i came back.  The yaki (fried dumplings) lack flavor and overall i'm just not pleased like I used to be.  I will probably go back one more time for them to prove me wrong but currently it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"The one thing I noticed during my most recent visit to Las Vegas is that you will never overpay when portions of food are considered. 
That being said, generally Korean food is not cheap (in California) and I was actually really surprised at the amount of food I got since I was looking at pricing way below what I would pay for the same dish in California. Especially considering the really generous portions. 
This place is very straight forward with a small and efficient setup. It wasn't busy at 6pm on a Wednesday which surprised me but I don't know the rush hours in the area. 
So my GF and I ordered 3 things:
Pork with tofu and kimchee.
Spicy chicken plate
Asian chicken salad. 

The Asian chicken salad since it came first.
The chicken was extremely tender and had a very savory sweet taste that coupled nicely with a basic dressing of vinegar and oil. Mixed greens are my favorite roughage so I was glad to see a bed of them along with carrots and cabbage. The salad was big enough to whet the appetites of two people. 
My least favorite dish (and I don't even like to say least favorite because it was GOOD) was the pork with tofu and kimchee. I'm not a huge fan of tofu and I really wish I would have ordered something that paired better with the pickled condiments (kimchee with a side of kimchee?) but you live and learn. I was between this and the stone pot bibimbap. Which I probably would have loved. 
The dish itself was very well made. No complaints. The pork was tender. The tofu was firm. The kimchee was kimchee'ish. 
The spicy chicken plate was my favorite. As the chicken in the asian salad was, so too was this chicken savory sweet and flavorful. This time with a hint of spice. (it should be noted that \"spicy\" at this particular restaurant is actually pretty mild). We're talking like somewhere between a quarter and a half chicken volume wise. Served with almost two cups steamed rice. Two thumbs up. THIS dish paired really well with the pickled condiments. And I would gladly order it again. 
All in all I have to say the place was great. Good food. GREAT prices and portions. Great service. I'd love to try more things before half the menu looked outstanding."}
{"text":"The meat jun is ammmmmaaaazing!  I've never had it before, but my bf and friends who've all had meat jun before say that it's delish as well.  My cousin tried another restaurants meat jun and she said it's way better at Jun's.  I really like the fish cake as my side dish.  I didn't care for the tofu.  Both locations have good service.  Also, the pricing is affordable."}
{"text":"If you're new to Korean food, Jun's isn't the place to go. It's a very poor representation of Korean food. And if you're NOT new to Korean food, don't go to Jun's. You'll be disappointed. But if you're in the area and you just want some form of Asian food no matter how vague it is, then sure-- go to Jun's.

I went here with my husband a week or two after it opened, and I was disappointed. I'm half-Korean, grew up with my Korean mother and grandmother, and now I frequent the Korean restaurants downtown to get my fix. I'm not a Korean chef, but I'm very familiar with the cuisine.

So-- I'm usually not one of those people who picks on the authenticity of a restaurant but this restaurant's food is far from authentic. Everything was off. I mean, even the texture of the rice was off. The rice!! This blew me away because I've had different versions of many Korean dishes but the rice is always the same. Except at Jun's. 

The spicy squid was so far from Korean cuisine, it's not even funny. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty-- but the closest it got to being Korean food would be if it was Thai food. The sauce, the texture of the dish as a whole, the vegetables that came with it-- nothing about it resembled Korean spicy squid except the \"squid\" part.

The seafood pancake had an American flare to it. It was very thick and dense and resembled an American buttermilk pancake in appearance and texture (except this one had seafood in it of course). If you've ever had any kind of Korean pancake before, you'd know this is unusual.

The galbi was a bit ridiculous. If you want galbi, go to one of the many Hawaiian restaurants in the area or go to a different Korean restaurant in Chinatown. Jun's charges the same as any of these restaurants but only gives you about 1/3 of the portion. And the marinade they use leaves something to be desired.

They do give you side dishes before your food comes out as is customary in Korean restaurants, but the side dishes are a bit curious as well. The only side dish that resembled a traditional Korean side dish was the kimchi. I'm not really sure what the rest of it was or where it came from.

The service is weak; the woman serving us wasn't very friendly or attentive. She took our order, gave us our drinks, and only returned once to drop the food off at our table. She didn't refill our drinks or stop to ask us if we needed anything else. She didn't even glance at our table once we got our food. We walked to the register to ask for our check and just paid our tab there. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't go back to Jun's. The food doesn't make up for the service and vice versa."}
{"text":"I used to live in North Las Vegas and this was my go-to for my Korean fix. After moving out of NLV ... a year and a half later this is the ONLY restaurant that I find myself craving and wanting to drive to the north side for! My step-grandmother is Korean and I've been eating korean food since I was like 4! Kimchi since I was 5, so I say I would have a pretty good idea of what this kind of food should taste like. ITS SO GOOD! I usually get the two meat combo with Kalbi, bulgogi, rice, and double kimchi. The portions are too big for me to finish in one sitting, but trust and believe I'll eat the rest of it later! If you're debating on whether or not to go here, stop thinking about it and just go. I promise it'll be good(:"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another try after 4 years. The first time didn't go so well, as my wife got immediately sick after our meal. I view this restaurant as the Korean version of Panda Express. Not great, but will do in a pinch if you are in a hurry and don't mind average food. 

We chose the following three entrees:

1. Bulgogi beef--Soggy, fatty beef in a salty sauce (Go to Ko-Mex for good bulgogi beef!)
2. Kalbi short ribs- Not much meat on dem' bones - but not bad! (Greenland Market food court has better Kalbi ribs!)
3. Chicken - Low quality and a little too charred for my liking (808 mix plate is a better option) 

*** All three meals came with a good helping of delicious steamed rice and a nice refreshing side salad. In fact, the salad was the best thing about our lunch.  

All three meals and two soft drinks came out to about 38.00 not including tip. Would I come back? Maybe, but it might take another 4 years. That's about how long it takes to forget if you liked it or not the last time you were there."}
{"text":"Jun's was fantastic.  It is nothing fancy.  Just a little shop in a strip mall that serves great authentic Korean food.  You can dine-in or carry out.  We elected to eat in and the nice lady working the counter doubles as your waitress.  I ordered the short ribs and they were outstanding.  They also give you five small sides.  I'm a huge kimchi fan and got about three different kinds.  My buddy ordered the a dish that as served in a molten hot bowl that had rice, meat, and an egg served on top.  He let me try it and it was super good.  If you are looking for a no nonsense place to have some good Korean food. Go to Jun's."}
{"text":"Food is always great and the tall man that is usually there when I am there (who looks like Dr. House) is always so nice and courteous. Even when this place is packed I get my food in a reasonable amount of time. Once I witnessed a group of military members who were waiting for their food during a busy time sitting in the restaurant conversating and the highest ranking one (a staff sergeant) berated the poor guy and was super rude about their order taking longer than normal. Now, I am a veteran myself and I know what kind of behavior is acceptable when you're in uniform. I also know that they didn't wait a super long time because I got there roughly around the same time they were in the process of ordering. Couldn't have been more than 20 mins, but Dr. House lookalike was super professional and apologetic despite that staff sergeants rudeness. I love businesses that put the customer first all the time, but in this case, the customer was definitely not right. By the way, if you have only an hour for lunch and this restaurant is a 20 minute drive from the base because of typical Craig road traffic, why would you go to a sit down place during a peak hour and expect to be served right away? Arrogant jerks."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Korean food. There's not a gigantic selection here, but the things they make are made well. My favorite dish in the Kimche Stew. It's hot, spicy and full of flavor. It reminds me a lot of the jjigae I used to eat in Seoul. You also get a bunch of sided with every meal. My only complaint is that the size of the sides are small and you don't get refills."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to eat we enjoyed it very much the teriyaki chicken is amazing and spicy pork rice bowl was pretty damn good too"}
{"text":"Great service, cleanliness and food! Order Jun's Special for a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Boss wanted to eat Korean food and this place just happened to be near our work.
I was sooooo ecstatic when he said he wanted to eat Korean food because Korean food is Bomb and the Northside of vegas was def missing this. 
This place seemed new and was very clean. Had most of the fixings- bean sprouts, cucumber kim chi, regular kim chi, etc, but more limited selection than I am used to. 
We ordered:
1) Kalbi and Meat Jun Combo- rice and salad (2 peice of meat jun and 1 kalbi)
-meat jun: just like in Hawaii. Super juicy and the right amount of sweetness
2) Kalbi platter- 3 pieces of kalbi
- kalbi was tender and seasoned great
3) Hot pot Bi BIM BOP
-large portion: heavy rice and veggies
4) Spicy pork plater- rice and salad combo (BOMB BOMB BOMB- a must get)- perfectly seasoned and tasty
- portion sizes were on the smaller side esp the meat jun and kalbi platter
The reason I will be back is because of the Meat jun!!!!- something that has been hard to find and tastes just like how it does back in Hawaii.
Think I found my new fav korean place on the North Eastside :)"}
{"text":"To all people that were born and raised from Hawaii and now live in Vegas, this is the place you should come thru for your kalbi fix when you have the cravings!  The kalbi taste just as better than Yummys Korean bbq from Hawaii.  This restaurant is located by Cannery theatre in north LV and the other location town side by the McCarran airport. Very good food and service. Highly recommend.  Authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Um, can you say delicious?! I've eaten here twice, and I'm still impressed! Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. Service was great, the man kept our drinks refilled and was very helpful. Having never tried Korean food, this place is great. 

Spicy chicken, kalbi, the cucumbers..I like it all!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food, made a special order for my mom who just had surgery.  Couldn't ask for better service.  Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. The portions are very reasonable, prices are fair, and the service is good. Only complaint is that their hours can be a little stiffling - we were once turned away on a Friday or Saturday night when we came for dinner around 7:30 because they closed at 8. Wish they had longer hours - 8 is too early to close on a weekend! They recently switched to letting each entree come with a choice of two appetizers instead of laying out like 6 on the table. It minimizes waste now and lets me just order my favorites (fish cakes for days!)."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here, I order the Jun's Special and side order of fried potstickers. I am very pleased on how quick you get your food. Normally if you receive your food too quick, you'll begin to wonder how it was prepped and if they just placed the pre-cooked food in the microwave. Well, I assure you that they don't re-heat anything. The food here is always wonderful and I especially love that they give military discounts for us vets. If you want to go to a Korean BBQ where you can cook your food yourself, then don't come here. Otherwise, this place is outstanding. Please consider opening up a restaurant in the Northwestern region of this city."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the spicy chicken combo plate. The spiciness marinate was perfect. The complimentary sides were so good. We got Korean pancake, cucumber kimchee, not to mention the regular kimchee my husband loves. Down to the sesame green salad. When I'm in town visiting I will differently come back."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. The staff were very friendly. The food was very good. Where in town can you get a good meal for 2 people and the cost was $20.00. This includes drinks and desert"}
{"text":"Very convenient location for me since I live near here and I must say their food is really good. Price is reasonable and affordable."}
{"text":"Good-size portions and food tasty. The rice was nice and soft -- just the way we like it. Salad dressing was very tasty. Hubby and I both had the same dish and enjoyed it. He ate all of his but I could only eat just a bit over half, so I took the rest home and will have it for lunch tomorrow. We had the 2-meat Combo Dish (Meat Chun and Bulgogi) for $11.95. This was our first time here and we plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but it's also not extraordinary by any means. I think my biggest issue is just that it's kind of over priced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much as I walked in as the place looked like a cafeteria.  I was very happy when my bibimbap was delivered as it also came with a few other banchan side dishes.  The beef was cooked and seasoned right and the egg on top was perfect and after mixing it all up is when all came together and it was delicious.  It is also under $10.  Real bargain for good quality food."}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout once before at Jun's so this was my first dine in experience. It's a little confusing on how the process goes because it looks like an order-at-the-counter restaurant but you can actually have a seat and be served. The restaurant was decently busy with mostly people in military uniforms. The man working here is very nice and efficient, checking on everyone frequently. I ordered the stone pot bibimbap with kimchi, seaweed, fish cakes and pancake for the banchan. The banchan itself is a ton of food! My favorite was the pancake followed by the fish cake. Fish cake really just tastes like a hard tofu, not fishy at all. I love the texture of both. The kimchi and seaweed are refreshing and it's good for you to eat these vinegary dishes. 

The stone pot bibimbap came in a sizzling stone dish and prompted a neighboring diner to turn around and comment on how good it smelled. They serve a spicy sauce with it so I poured it on, mixed up the egg and dug in. Leave the rice alone on the bottom to make it crispy. This dish is seriously hot and hearty. They add beef, bean sprouts, cabbage, carrots, onions, shiitake mushrooms, zucchini and some other root vegetable. Tons of good stuff in here. It makes me question why anyone would ever go to Teriyaki Madness in the next parking lot over. Between the banchan and the bibimbap there was no way I was finishing this meal. I asked for a to-go box and there was probably more food in the box than I ended up eating. This meal is a pretty healthy option and I'm glad it's near work. I was really tempted to have the japchae but...next time!"}
{"text":"I'm late but this is one of my favorite spots the food is fresh and delicious and is brought out hot the ramen is really good just tell them if you eat beef to add beef it gives it a very great flavor"}
{"text":"So simple, yet so good. Loved the small and easy menu. Everything is so flavorful and delicious. I got the bibimbap and it was more than enough to finish for one person. I also got the veggie tofu soup that was nice and spicy with plenty of tofu. It was nice and boiling hot with tons of spice. The pictures of the banchan on here does not do it justice for how delicious they were. I asked the lady if the kimchee was home made and she replied yes, sorry home made kimchee is always better than the jar stuff. Anyways definitely a treat on this side of town"}
{"text":"We love this Korean restaurant!! They have all of the foods my husband was raised on and they are all authentic to taste.  We go here or order it to go at least once a month. Fast service and always accurate!  In addition, they have Kimchee in bulk that my husband and daughter just love and it is inexpensive. Great place!"}
{"text":"I haven't had good korean food since I left Hawaii so I was excited when I drove by this place. It wasn't crowded at all when we came and we ordered the meat jun and bbq chicken combo. The waitress didn't really crack a smile. She wasn't rude but just didn't smile. The food was ok. Not a lot of flavor to the meat jun. Any good meat jun should taste awesome without the sauce. Chicken was ok. For the price (11.95) I expect more on the plate and more than 2 side dishes"}
{"text":"I had a favorite take out K Bbq place back home in LA that I miss. I had been to traditional places here in LV but none of them had the flavored that I was looking for. That is until I discovered Juns. This place is great. The grilled chicken is top notch and the sides are very flavorful."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas my girlfriend brought me to Jun's on eastern and 215. Loved the food especially Korean!! For this location I've been coming here for the past 3 yrs and flavors are still consistent and portion is plus!! So glad there's a Korean BBQ this side of town."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location on Eastern way back when... now I'm on the complete opposite end of town, and you can't imagine my excitement when I saw this name come up on my search for restaurants nearby. 

I haven't dined in here, but have done take out several times. I LOVE all their side dishes, and have never had any bad experiences with their food. Customer service is minimal. They are not super nice, but definitely are not \"angry Korean mean.\" 

Great value for the amount of food given, and free and unlimited hot barley tea! 

The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because I order the Spicy Soft Tofu Soup every time, and it isn't consistently good. Today's order was extra watery, thin, and lacking in tofu, but no problems with taste, other than that."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is delicious! We went on a Sunday and it was pretty quiet. The bright yellow interior along with the plants and decorations had a welcoming feel.

The food was good. I think the secret to all good food is sesame oil and Korean food include a generous amount of it in everything. My brother got the bulgogi plate and I got bibibom. Both were what exactly what we expected. Plus, I got a really good #yolkporn video. 

Our waitress, and host, was very sweet and she checked up on us multiple times to make sure everything was ok.

You will definitely see me back here! :) Next time I end up by Craig Ranch Park area, I will probably end up here."}
{"text":"Its good been going here  for a year now.  Great food cooked when you order it.  Juns special a favorite.  The only complaint i have is prices went up recently and nothings changed. I cant understand why same food more price now, i could go to a buffet for almost  $20 a plate!!!!"}
{"text":"Soft Tofu Soup was AWESOME! I have a favorite restaurant in Honolulu, HI that serves up an exceptional soup, but this one may have just moved ahead!"}
{"text":"If you feel like Korean food and you happen to be in the area, then this place is just OK.  I had the Stone Pot Bibimbob with the Spicy Tofu soup. The Bibimbob was OK but the portions of meat and vegetables was so small that I had to put in alot of sauce cuz there was so much rice it tasted so bland.  The poke was good. And one thing I was curious about was Meat Chun.  Never saw it before and would like the try it next time... if I was ever in the area again.

This is the first Korean place I went to that didn't have alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb! Never disappointed! Spicy chicken and spicy pork! Fricken amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Would never eat here, the appearance of the food at the entrance is so unpleasant. Don't know how it's been rated 5"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was polite. I ordered the spicy beef and vegetable soup and it was wonderful. My husband enjoyed his beef fried rice and the dumpling appetizer was delicious! The side dishes were good as well. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This Korean food joint is a great place to grab some good Korean food! Always a great place to grab some quick lunch or dinner. The dishes come with a great amount of food too. I always get the Jun's Special. I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Visiting Jun's Korean again, this time is much more of what I like!  I'm gonna just stick with the big classics from now on.

After watching too many Korean dramas on DramaFever...went down to Jun's to get us some Stone Pot BibimBob ($10.95).  Excellent choice!  Pay the extra $2 to get it in the stone pot - give it some extra flavor!!

For me, nothing more soothing to the soul than a big bowl of hot rice topped with beef & mixed pickled vegetables.  Then hit it with a sunny side up EGG!  So tasty!  For you uninitiated to bibimbob - you really wanna break the yolk open and let it run all over your bowl, then mix it all UP!  Let it sit for a couple minutes to let all the flavors meld, trust me though the stone pot is key!  Keeps it all warm and even crusts up your rice a little bit for some added texture.  With your multiple Korean banchan you are set to EAT!  This time we had sides of kim chee, shoyu potatoes, bean sprouts, broccoli, and fried zucchini.  

What comforting eats!  Totally warms you up inside.  Having a Korean spoon with the long handle is also key for maximum enjoyment.  Get down to the bottom of the bowl!  

I will be back to Jun's again just for a Stone Pot BibimBob. 

Mashisseoyo!  (Delicious!)"}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Korean bbq and fell in love. Tried their location in Henderson a couple of weeks ago but after searching for more Korean food on Yelp, found out that they have a location in North Las Vegas. Hubs and I got excited and decided to go check it out. 
We both got the two item combo. I ended up getting the spicy pork and the bbq rib eye. They both were really good. 
Also, the service was a lot faster and nicer at this location. I'm sure we will be back. Hopefully next time I will be brave enough to try one of the special items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I just found out that there's a Jun's in my neck of the woods.  For the last 2 years, the Jun's located off Eastern Avenue has been a meet up spot for me and one of my good friends. She loves Jun's and if I knew there was one north, I'd have HER come up. Probably doesn't matter anyway. She has lived here for the past 10 years and driving 15 miles away is considered far.  For me coming from California, driving 30 minutes for dinner or to meet friends is normal. Probably a moot point anyway because I would have to drive to see her anyway. 

Well anyways, I've been a fan of Jun's since my first visit a couple of years ago.  This location is just as good.  But this time I changed it up, just a little. My normal order at Jun's is their Grilled BBQ Chicken.  This restaurant gets it right every time and regardless of which Jun's I go to, it's still made the way I like it.  If you haven't tried their BBQ Chicken, you're missing out.  It's about 8 oz of the most tastiest chicken one could ever want.  I even double the order when I really am striving for more protein.  I also got their Chicken Katsu, which was just okay.  Jun's really hooks up the Katsu.  It's almost double in size compared against other Hawaiian/Japanese Restaurants.  Only issue, it was a bit bland.  Good presentation, but lacking taste in the chicken.  I found this ironic since their BBQ chicken is the bomb. 

Overall, I'm just excited that I found this place. I have to thank Yelp for this. I was at a stoplight in Summerlin and wanted to know the distance to Jun's.  To my surprise, two locations showed up with this one towards home.  Tonight was just my first of many visits to come.  You looking for some good Korean Food, look no further.  Jun's is the way to go.

PS:  I think it's obvious from my reviews...I love me some Katsu."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing special to brag about. The spicy beef soup was very bland. The meat combo platter was decent."}
{"text":"I'm happy I found a Korean restaurant so  close to me. Everyone is really nice and helpful when it comes to explaining the menu. I love their kimchi soup!"}
{"text":"Yummy lunch here at this new Establishment. Plenty of parking in the private lot and prices here are reasonable.

The Banchan was exceptional. I ordered the 2  meat combo plate for lunch - spicy chicken and Bulgogi. The entree came with salad and steam rice 

Service here is on the spot and the place is clean. Reasonable prices and quality food makes this an ideal place for lunch or a quick meal."}
{"text":"Hawaiian style Korean food :)  My favorite is the Spicy Chicken plate. The kochujung sauce that they use is hot & flavorful. Other dishes I have tried and liked ..chicken katsu, spicy squid, bi bim bap, spicy pork, and bi bim kook soo. The owners are always friendly, the establishment is clean and the food Is yummy & affordable. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"As someone who spent a year on Korea I thought this place was really good. Service was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"As an enthusiastic consumer of Korean cuisine I love having the Jun's North Las Vegas location close to home and work.  

Having dined in and ordered take out I can highly recommend the bright clean atmosphere and superb service.  The owners always greet us and make us feel very welcome.

I recommend the Dolsot Bibimbap and Kalbi.  The assortment of side dishes or banchan served with each meal are always flavorful and very fresh.

Do yourself a favor and visit Jun's soon.  You will have a great dining experience and probably make some new friends!"}
{"text":"Having moved from Hawaii, I was super excited to find this place in North Las Vegas where oriental food is scarce compared to other parts of Vegas. I'm hungry, but not hungry enough to drive my broke ass all the way to Chinatown, so having this place up north is excellent.

I read past reviews, and I agree the cashier is a bit quiet and keeps to herself (hence the four stars instead of five), but I'm not here to make friends; I'm here to eat! Now like I said, I'm from Hawaii so my experience with Korean food is limited to Yummy's and the like, which is very similar to Jun's: you choose 1-3 main dishes and 3-4 side dishes. They also take orders at your table if you want to dine in. It's also a good place to come for lunch because business is slow at that time, but it gets packed pretty quickly for dinner.

The food is GREAT; it reminds me of Yummy's. But then again, there's not much competition for oriental food in NLV, where most places are super greasy, salty, and have too much meat in the menu. For all of you veggie-lovers, Jun's serves hot tofu soup and veggie side dishes. The portions are right for the price, and I always have leftovers I can bring home and eat at a later time. The bibimbop is the bibim-BOMB. I like how they use the meat for flavoring and it's more of a healthy veggie experience than a carnivore's delight. They also sell some bomb kimchi in large jars to take home with you--you know, for your daily serving of vegetables.

I'm not an expert in authenticity, so don't judge me if your Korean mother-in-law shuns you for poor taste. But take your Hawaiian & Island friends here; they'll love you--more than your Korean mother-in-law ever will."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviews, we have had nothing but friendly service from the owner & her son...on all 3 visits. The first time we ordered bulgogi, galbi & meat jun. That's when we realized this restaurant caters to Hawaiian/Islander palates. bulgogi & galbi was too sweet and less true Korean. Minys 1 star. The next two visits we stuck too dolsot bibimbap. Very delicious. Also try the ahi appetizer!"}
{"text":"The only Korean restaurant in North Las Vegas!!

Food is pretty good quality. Service usually is not bad. Can either take out or dine in. 

My favorite is the seafood noodle! Really delicious and good portion!

Good for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately seated. Wasn't busy at all. Drinks brought over quickly and the menu isn't complicated to figure out. Friend and I ordered. Jun's special and the hot bowl bimibop... Or however it is spelled. Im still new to Korean food, forgive me. 

Food was delicious. Absolutely will be back. My bowl kind of over cooked the rice at the bottom so it was hard to eat. But everything was delicious. Friend tried to eat everything but couldn't. 

I wish I had pretty words to describe this experience. 

Decoration s are nice, fountain soda, yellow walls are kind of strange."}
{"text":"The Meat Jun/Chicken Katsu combo with fried zucchini, Kim chee, fish cake as the sides. Nuff said and order that and you'll be satisfied! Saba-very good, Bulgogi-very good, making me hungry again just thinking about the menu!"}
{"text":"Had the combo with chicken, spicy pork and meat chun. On the side they serve kimchi, sweet potatoes, and fried tofu. The main plate was big but wish they served more kimchi on the side."}
{"text":"I love Korean food.  I especially love really good Korean food, so I was thrilled when Jun's opened-- it's close, pretty quick, and yummy!

I've ordered takeout several times (bulgogi and japchae mostly), but stopped in for lunch as well.  The dolsot bibimbap was awesome.  SUPER hot stone bowl so the rice got that nice crispy crunchy crust and the egg was still runny.  Bibimbap sauce was served on the side so you could add as much (or as little) as you wanted.  Banchan consisted mostly of a couple different types of kimchi, so not a huge selection but perfect for lunch.  

FYI, if you're dining in, just go grab a table, they'll bring you a menu and get your drink order.  The giant menus hanging from the ceiling are for take-out."}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem!  I've been hearing about Jun through my friends and they kept raving about the meat jun and the katsu, so I had to go try them out.

Prices are reasonable, service is with a smile and the lady who works there is super friendly. We ordered kimchi jjigae and the katsu + mean jun plate.  Banchan also came out with our meal, too.

Banchan - It's not the best, but it's still edible. you can get free refills of your banchan, too.

kimchi jjigae - actually not bad. it's better than the other korean restaurants in the general area.

katsu + meat jun - katsu was OMFG SO GOOD.  their sauce was yummy, too!  I wanted more!!  meat jun was okay - I had better in hawaii, but for las vegas, i suppose this will do and will satisfy any hawaiian local who has nostalgia.

i can't wait until i go home again so I can go back here and eat their katsu~"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot if you love Korean cuisine, it has great food and a large option of the traditional Korean side dishes. The service is great friendly staff always attentive and friendly. I found it on yelp and have always enjoyed Korean food so figured I'd give it a try, it was worth it! Great prices to!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I was trying to provide my family a taste of Korea. But it was nothing like anything I ate while stationed over there."}
{"text":"Who would have thought there'd be a delicious Korean restaurant in north town. The ambiance might not be too appealing, but the food is great. I'm a creature of habit so I always go to my go to dish here the spicy chicken. 

The spices are spot on and the portion size is huge. It even comes with white rice, a salad and some Korean side dishes like kimche, potato pancakes, and cucumbers. I've also heard the tofu soup is amazing here from other coworkers.

I'd highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. It's perfect for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and it was wonderful! I got the spicy chicken plate, and made sure to ask if it was really spicy. I was told it had some kick. It was actually pretty mild, but still super yummy! I also ordered the dumplings as an app and they to we're really good. 

Some people reviewed that the service was bad...I actually had pretty great service! The Lady that works there seems grumpy until you talk to her! So talk her up!

The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because they were sold out of bulgogi at 2pm on a Saturday...and that is what I went for!

Overall a great experience! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Korean Food at its finest. Friendly staff but the \"Korean Pancake\" could use some more seafood ingredients lol not just squid/octopus. 3 Star rating cause I wasn't really impressed with that particular dish."}
{"text":"this place is a gem hidden in the heart of the dessert ..

i can truly say i found my new fave asian spot ...
:'D"}
{"text":"The location is very convenient very close to freeway access. Normally I'm offered more options, even on the back of the menu it says 4, I only was given 3, the cucumber kimchee was not given this time. Was kind of disappointed by this. On my table we were out of soy sauce as well. The chicken dishes that we ordered were decent. They were out of mochi too. Today I guess Santa wasn't real...."}
{"text":"I've been having lunch here since the week they opened, but I purposefully waited to write my review.  At first I was so excited to finally have Korean food in North Las Vegas that it was love at first sight!  But after dining here quite a few times, I've been better able to see it for what it is: a decent lunch spot that is more of the Hawaiian/Korean type, with consistent banchan and really good dumpling soup.

I haven't had any of the Hawaiian inspired offerings, but they seem to carry the typical plate lunches: teriyaki beef, chicken, kalbi, and so on.  I've had the Korean pancake, sundubu, kimchi jjigae and their dumpling soup (mandu duk guk?).  By far my favorite dish is the dumpling soup!  Everything else is decent, but I've had better versions of each dish elsewhere.  The dumplings in this soup are large and filled with meat and veggies, there are lots of rice cakes in the soup, and the broth is very tasty; it seems that other versions I've had don't have as flavorful of a broth as here.

I'm glad that this spot opened up, since it's a great change from all the other chains along Craig Road.  With banchan, you get a good sized lunch for under $10.  If you're planning on going around 12pm-1pm though, be sure to block out at least a full hour.  Lots of people from Nellis AFB dine here, and the service can be pretty slow at times.  Solid 3 stars, I know I'll be back for that dumpling soup!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Korean food and my Mom didn't feel like cooking, so we stopped by the closest restaurant to grab some eats. I honestly wasn't expecting much here, but was pleasantly surprised at how cozy and quaint the place was. We caught them at a slow period. We sat ourselves and the friendly waiter assisted us after a few minutes (he seemed to be doing double duty with answering the phones). My Mom is Korean and speaks it fluently, so she and the waiter conversed in the language as he gave us our menus. She later went to the bathroom and he returned and asked me for the drink order in English.

I wasn't expecting to see some Hawaiian/local inspired food on the menu! I spotted chicken katsu and Hawaiian style BBQ chicken, as well as sushi appetizers. Everything sounded delicious! We ended up getting the mandoo as appetizers, and I ordered a mixed plate of meat chun and kal bi. 

The panchan was served immediately (we didn't get to choose them), closely followed by the mandoo appetizers. They were delicious, almost as good as my Mom's cooking. :) They had 3 different varieties of kimchi, though my favorite was the daikon. Later, the mixed plate arrived, and the portions were suitable, though I would've liked a little bit more kal bi. Everything tasted great! Some places make their meat too salty or use a strange spice, but their meat chun and kal bi was terrific. No complaints. 

Definitely worth the stop, and when I go back to Vegas I'll come back here as well. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Normally I would take my order to-go, but since I was in the area, I decided to eat in the restaurant for once.

As when I usually order food to-go here, I got the kalbi rib meal. Even though I normally love what I bring home to eat, the kalbi I got this time was even better. Maybe because it came right off the grill and onto a plate in a matter of seconds, but the ribs were especially tender. They were grilled perfectly to medium, with a even more pronounced caramelized char and slightly sweet and savory flavor.

I should eat inside more often since I was given a side salad with my meal and a extra side dish, versus not getting a salad and only getting two sides when I take food to-go. Like I normally do, I got the \"pancake\" and tofu, but with a extra pancake as my third side item. Man, occasionally dipping everything into their red chili sauce just takes the tatse of everything to the next level.

Service was top notch. I was greeted and seated promptly. My order was taken and my drink was given to me quickly. The food came out hot and fresh. And even though the drink was fountain and it was close enough for me refill it easily, the woman who took my order filled it up for me. She continually checked up on me throughout my meal.

When I take the food to-go I wish they threw in 1-2 more ribs or lowered the price a couple of bucks. But since I got a extra side and side salad while I ate inside, the price was just about right this time.

This is my regular destination when I need a kalbi rib fix or when I need to buy some excellent marinades. Now I see myself coming more often since eating inside is a better deal than just taking the food to-go. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm usually satisfied with juns, but considering they only gave me half of my soup I'm not really happy with them"}
{"text":"Vegan friendly & delicious 
The customer service was great too. Very helpful & accommodating to avoiding animal products :) will be back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"For a quick authentic Korean food, this place wasn't so bad. Just wish the hours were longer with closing."}
{"text":"this was our second try in this korean restaurant AND we are very glad to write it on yelp that their korean food is getting so much better!!! 5 stars as of today!   thanks Tim for the good service too!!!"}
{"text":"Totally addicted to the spicy pork and the kimchi fried rice!!! Thank goodness this place opened near my house because my family and I would go out for Korean BBQ every weekend alllll the way in Chinatown. This restaurant is AMAZING and the prices are even better! YUMMM!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant, clean bathrooms. Kalbi was yummy so was the banchan cucumber, kim chee, tofu and bean sprouts. They also serve hawaiian poke I was worried when I saw the color of the tuna but it turned out pretty good. The only thing that stumped me was the side salad. The salad was really crisp and fresh but no dressing. We never have left over kalbi but this time we did. So it was an order of 4 kalbi dinners, 1 order of hawaiian poke and 4 sodas total was $61 by far the cheapest we have paid for Korean BBQ. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!! the decor is bad the tables have holes the food does not seem to be fresh not alot of buisness to move the product"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3 - it is still a clean restaurant but it is very small and can get uncomfortable with time. It's a sit down area but they can only sit less than 40 people. The place is so small, that they shouldn't be a sit down restaurant actually! It's smaller than most Starbucks!!  

Service: 1 - the wait for food is just too long for the size of the place. It was long when I first came here when it opened, but now that it's been a few months, you would expect it to get a bit faster, but sadly the service and wait time is even slower than before!! That's just too much! 

Food: 3 - I'm not saying the food is bad, it's pretty okay. It's not the best of the best Korean food, but it's still pretty good. 

The Good: Chicken Katsu, Kalbi, Spicy Chicken--that 3 meat plate really saves you a lot of money!! The food was cooked fresh to order, and the meats were pretty yummy and hot! 

The Bad: The sides (bean sprouts and kimchi) were not fresh and didn't taste that great. 

Sooo, I'm all for the 3 meat plate, it's pretty good. But what it comes with...not that great. But if they make their wait times a lotttt shorter, they could really be a quality place."}
{"text":"Talk about bang for your buck! Jun's is in a great location for a quick meal. The service is great and they are efficient. I get the Jun's special every time (mostly because I can't make a decision, and it's such a good price! Jun's special includes Bulgogi, Kali, teriyaki chicken, mandu, potstickers, rice, and two sides (banchan)! The selection of banchan is awesome and I usually find myself ordering all of them. They have radish, cucumber, and cabbage kimchi...as well as sprouts, egg pancakes, and potatoes. There is always room to sit and you feel like every meal is home-cooked!"}
{"text":"How did I not know that I worked so close to this place for over a year?? I have started taking classes at the local Community College after work but I have a 2.5 hour break in between work and the start of my class so every once in a while I bring papers to be graded or the homework I've put off to the last minute here.  Work is just so much more enjoyable when you have good food Korean food to accompany it.

The place reminds me of a lot of the restaurants in LA K-town, except this store isn't 24 hours.  It is nice to be reminded of home while I'm living here in Sin City.  Jun's has all your Korean basics from Bulgogi (BBQ beef), Bi Bim Bop (rice, veggies, meat), and Mandoo (Dumplings)


So far I have tried the following dishes:

Chop Chae 7.95 - (pan fried noodle w/ vegetable & beef)
Sweet potato noodles fried with lots of veggies and meat.  This is one of those classics Korean dishes that I remember my friends mom's always making.  It is oilier than your average noodle dish, but it tastes so good.  

Korean Pancake $9.95 - (pancake with seafood & vegetable)
When they say seafood they really mean seafood.   When I ordered this dish I thought it might come with a few chunks but really I think there was more octopus than any other ingredient, so I was happily surprised.  They also give a really good sized pancake which is perfect if you want to eat half for dinner and save the rest for lunch the next day like I do.

Spicy Soft Tofu Soup $8.95 - (soft tofu w/ beef & vegetable) 
It is a little more sour here than I'm use to but it still hits the spot on a chilly day.  Cracking the raw egg into the boiling hot stone pot is a must!  Again they don't skimp on the meat or veggies.  This is a great pick if you like spicy soupy dishes.

If you check this place out and see a girl with tons of Chemistry papers say \"Hi\" because that is probably me."}
{"text":"Jun's Korean food is a great concept. Kind of like fast food Korean in a sense. The prices are very reasonable, but that's expected in this part of town. I come here probably about twice a month to get my Korean food craving fix! :p
Their banchan (side dishes) are not the best honestly. They tend to be a little on the dry side because they're sitting in open cafeteria food trays.
The main dishes themselves are actually pretty good. They also sell kimchee and korean bbq rib marinate in jars.
I wouldn't take my friends or family that are visiting Las Vegas here, but for myself when I need that Korean food fix fast and conveniently. This is my go to stop!"}
{"text":"The brown rice bibimbap earns my vote of confidence! It is the only place we have found that will do this around town, and even though I didn't try it, I was pleased by the option. I did try the $8 Spicy Chicken combo that you can also get with brown rice. It comes with a little side salad, and of course, my favorite: banchan! As I recalled from their other location, they serve up very solid banchan, possibly my second favorite in town thanks to the variety, freshness and flavor. As for the spicy chicken, I would definitely order it again. I may not be making a special trip North for Jun's, but I am happy to report they are dishing up delectable fare at a reasonable price. And, when you combine that with banchan, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Had the Korean bbq chicken and the wings. It was alright, nothing I'd eat again. Ended up throwing away the wings. When I saw the reviews, thought it would be better than what it was. Suggest trying the Pineapple Express a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Really good Hawaiian style Korean food! Reminds m of yummys in Hawaii but better. We had the 3 item combo with spicy pork, bulgogi, and meat Chun. Really enjoyed all the meats. Meat Chun was really good it's hard to find on the mainland. Side dishes were alright. Disappointed that it seemed like they didn't make them from scratch. Portions are really big though which of course I like. But overall really good a must try."}
{"text":"I had low expectations for this place. I live nearby but took me years to try it. Let's face it, it's a Korean restaurant in North Las Vegas! How legit can this possibly be?

I placed a to-go order to pick-up after the gym. We got a Jun's Special, Kalbi, bibimbap and mandoo.

Jun's Special:
This $12 combo has everything! Bulgogi, Kalbi, chicken, mandoo (meat and veggie dumplings) and meat chun (thin piece of marinated beef battered in egg and fried). That's a lot of food. It comes with rice. 4.5/5

Bibimbap:
Beef and veggies topped with a sunny side egg. Comes with rice, Kimchee and Korean hot sauce. I love mushrooms but I didn't know I scooped up some zucchini which makes my stomach hurt big time. You have to add hot sauce to make this tasty. The kimchee was delicious. 4/5

Mandoo:
Fried veggie and meat dumplings with a dipping sauce. I'm not used to seeing this as wrinkly half-moons like a Chinese dumpling. Does it taste good? Absolutely! 4/5

Kalbi:
Large pieces that are tender and semi-lean. Very tasty. 4/5

I'm comparing Jun's with the ones I've had in Korea and Vegas. It's not as awesome as Soyo but the location and legitness of this place give me a reason to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very clean. Quick food and very good . I am always pleased with the food I get here."}
{"text":"Juns is a great place and all the food is fantastic. I have tried many things on the menu and all have been great from the hot pots to the side dishes. The Kim Chee is top notch and some of the best I have tried. 
I have eaten in and both times the woman at the front and also sever were fantastic and really ontop of refilling drinks and grabbing you some extra sides if you are empty. 
They have some delicious sauces and offer them for sale so you can take them home. 
Check this place out if you want some Korean food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 5 stars, but the service is a bit lax. I have ZERO complaints about the food or prices and I find myself craving it pretty often. I wish I would have stopped by sooner after working nearby for years. I just make sure I'm not on a tight schedule when stopping by. 

My wife and I bought some of their spicy korean marinade and its excellent as well"}
{"text":"Whoa.....downhill for sure in this update.  I was the first to review this new location and it's been a while since I went back because the waitress/owner gives such horrible service!  The food is good but I doubt we will be back because you just feel unwelcomed here -- like a nuisance.  Bleh, I can wait till I go home for some REAL Korean food (in Hawaii).  Where you can get some Mac salad too...lol!"}
{"text":"I wanted Asian but I didn't want to make a long drive to Chinatown, so we decided to try Jun's.  This place is probably the only Korean option in North Las Vegas, so it pretty much has a monopoly.  But with that said, the food was decent.  I particularly liked the meat jun, the beef was tender and the dipping sauce was flavorful.  I ordered the two combination and also picked kalbi.  The kalbi really was lackluster in flavor and texture.  It was extremely thin and dry.  The flavor was also just average.  We ended up having to wait 15 minutes for our food since they needed to cook white rice.  I'm guessing they ran out since we came right before closing.  They offered to change it out for brown rice...but I'm not a big fan of brown rice and opted to wait.  For the inconvenience, they were nice enough to give us complimentary fried mandoo (potstickers).  The mandoo was fried to a golden perfection but the flavor again was just average.  The banchan assortment consisted of kim chee cucumbers, kim chee, bean sprouts, and a candied potato.  I noticed in their assortment up front, they also have fish cake and other varieites.  I wish I had know that earlier and perhaps I could have requested that as a banchan.  Overall, solid offering for the location."}
{"text":"I have been to many Korean restraunts and this place is by far better than some I have been to downtown . i drove by many times and  I'm glad I stopped cause it's well priced ,great food and service!love the cucumbers!!!
Can't wait to go back for more...
Angela c."}
{"text":"I love Jun's, I do.

What I don't love about them is how thin their kal-bi is in comparison to its price. Since they first opened up in NLV, I feel like the quality of their kal-bi have gone downhill. They have been really putting the skinny on their meats.

But we haven't ousted Jun's from our potential go-to places, especially for korean, because eating there is the closest thing to as if you are eating at Yummys Korean in Hawaii. The whole flow of choosing your own side dishes, that's what I like. And....even though the portioning to price sucks, they aren't bad at all taste wise. I'm a korean food lover so it's hard for me to turn my back on korean food even if it is expensive. Lol. Even more so that it helps they are just 5 minutes away.

I've had to go vegeterian at one point so being able to order their banchans on the side helped me alot!

One of the places where you gotta try it for yourself and go from there. I definitely don't recommend coming to this location if it is completely out of your way."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean and cute but small. Can get busy at lunch times but worth the wait. I always get the Kalbi plate or the dumping rice cake soup. And always gotta start with their mandu which is potstickers. They are crispy golden deliciousness of goodness paired with a perfect sauce."}
{"text":"Jun's is a great place for lunch in North Vegas. There's plenty of parking and their quick service makes for the perfect break for work. I ordered the two meat combo plate for lunch - spicy chicken and meat chun. Spicy chicken wasn't too spicy, it was tender and had good flavor. Meat chun (jun) is a Hawaiian inspired dish, it's a thin slice of beef that is dipped in an egg batter and fried, it's delicious. They serve everything with all the traditional side dishes (banchan) which are all great as well. This was the perfect quick fix for my craving of Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star review because I like what they do here!

I admit I am not  a Korean food expert.  I have been to 2 Korean restaurants and both times I ended paying too much money for bad service and snippy Korean waitresses giving me nasty looks for asking questions.  Basically, I have never enjoyed a Korean restaurant dining experience although I do like the food.

So I go here.  The place is set up like a quick service place but she comes out and takes your order.  The lady was very friendly and helpful.  The menu has pictures which really helps.

I order the 3 meat combo.  Chicken, Bulgogi and something else...  Everything was good.  I think it was $11 for the combo.  Came with salad, rice, kimchee and 2 other relishes. It was a lot of food.  

I really liked the blending of a ethnic food restaurant for the non ethnic person.

This probably isn't the most authentic Korean restaurant, but you get a big helping of tasty food for a fair price.  That's all I ask..."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and spicy pork and chicken cutlet was good, seaweed salad $$ for what you get, salad not my choice of cut greens ( I prefer less white in my lettuce) all in all good meal as always"}
{"text":"Solid Korean food. I had the Kimchee Soup, which was very good. I would have enjoyed it with pork vice beef, but it was definitely good. The banchan were good, especially the potato pancake. I was not asked if I wanted more, I don't know if that's just a lunch policy or not."}
{"text":"If you ever need to fill up on protein, come to Jun's.  We ate dinner here recently and I ordered the Jun's Special with bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, mandoo, meat chun, brown rice, and salad.  All of that for $13.95 (no substitues) and it was so much food that I couldn't finish it in one sitting.  I could have done without the meat chun, which is thinly sliced beef fried in egg batter:  I just didn't like the taste.  Everything else, though, was very flavorful.  I've been to the other Jun's location on Eastern Ave. in Henderson and have always been a fan of their kalbi.  A third location is coming soon to the corner of Tropicana and Hualapai to please the Jun's fans on that side of town.   Good food and good service and it's near our house=Korean BBQ happiness."}
{"text":"'This is the best Korean food in North Las Vegas', is an understatement. I freaking love this place! I usually get the jun's special which is a combination Kalbi, bubolgi, bbq chicken, meat chun and mandu with a side if a salad. So good! Also I order an appetizer of mandu before since the dish only comes with one, which are these perfectly crispy fried-dumplings. 
Clean restaurant, nice people - oh! The people! The people that work here are the nicest people ever! The service is right on point. There's never a moment where you aren't provided with the best service."}
{"text":"FRIGGEN PHENOMENAL. Food was absolutely on point and the tall guy behind the counter was awesome. I'm writing this as I eat because I was too excited about how great the food was to let another minute go by without telling the world. I highly suggest the Jun special, it's an awesome sampler plate of all the goods."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wake up just really craving some Korean food. 

I'm glad i found his spot not to far from my home!! 

Went in yesterday and ordered my self a bibimbap. I don't know why but I absolutely love the idea of a rice and toppings inside a ridiculously hot stone bowl.  Maybe it's all the crispy bits of rice that form at the bottom. 

Only thing I didn't like about this place you are limited to 2 sides of banchan (at a time?) I don't like having to choose sides. 

I will be back though and very soon!!"}
{"text":"If you like Korean food that's not overpriced then you should check out Jun's Korean restaurant. I had the spicy chicken and it was delicious. My boss let me have some of his short ribs and they were even better.. will definitively be back and explore the menu further. 

Yum yum."}
{"text":"I go here to get my Korean fix. This is exactly like shopping mall Korean food. They could serve shit on plate call it Korean and I will eat it because there are no other Korean places around. 

I see stupid ass reviews about service, go to an Asian place and expect bad service. Just go and eat! I like the food, extra meaty, extra fiber, and it comes out quick. I don't need a smile or peppy service to enjoy my meal. I'm Chinese so if I need some-ting I go up to the server station and grab it myself. For $8 a meal, I ain't expecting \"may I change your socks\" service. If I do it's a bonus. 

Seriously writing this review is making me hungry. I usually get the spicy chicken plate and the fucking chap Chae noodles. If you don't feel like driving all the way to china town for it, come here. Excellent place to go before a movie. If you're an Asian guy dating a white chick, bring her here. If you think orange chicken is amazing, you'll like the flavors here.(don't ask for orange chicken.) damn orange chicken pisses me off. Why? I don't want to get into it. 

Seriously location, location, location. Five stars for the amount of protein I get, five stars to taking care of my Korean craving, however we all crave Korean girls. Finally I give 5 stars for having the best sides. I'll keep coming here till the day I move closer to china town, in reality if you live in Henderson, why the hell would one move by China town? I'm going to get mugged."}
{"text":"Was craving K BBQ but didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of \"cook it yourself\". Came to this mom&pop style joint and was blown away by the food quality, taste, and service. 2-meat combo w Kalbi ribs and chicken are a must!"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch at Jun's Korean Restaurant on Craig Rd. I paid with a debit card. After I paid my bill, the owner left the cashier area in a hurry, to attend to a new customer that had enter the restaurant. I waited for her to return so I could tip her.  When I asked her to give me change, she caught a nasty attitude with me for no reason. She made a comment in reference of, you should of asked for change when I had the register open! I told her I would have  ask you then, but you left the cashier area so fast. I do not understand why be nasty and have 
an attitude with me, when all I was doing is tipping you. She just lost a customer! In my opinion, she is a  tight wade she should hire a waitress, she is to darn cheap to. She is the waitress and server all in one. So expect to wait awhile for the food. Also, I asked her a cup for the Ice Tea, I had not finised. She charged me for flipping drink.$ 1.75. I have NEVER had to paid for a drink that I had already paid for.  BEWARE FOLKS SMH!"}
{"text":"The food here is really really good. I'm happy that they now offer delivery! I ordered the Jun special today and everything was very tasty except that I didn't receive any of the sides that are said to come with it in the delivery menu. Next time I'll just call and remind them. Thank you Jun's. Also, the delivery fee is 2.99 not \"free\" as stated. But that's still cheap for delivery!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Taste is still great but portions now suck for the price. $16 for a Juns special with barely anything on the plate anymore. Portions arent the same as they were like a year ago. Not eating here anymore. I would rather go to a Korean BBQ than to get ripped off."}
{"text":"Ordered food for take out. The food was okay, nothing special... 

The major disappointment was when I picked up the food the lady clearly checked the food to make sure our order was correct and when we got home we noticed the Korean pancake dish was burnt, to where it wasn't edible. 

It was our first and last visit..."}
{"text":"I don't eat Korean food very often. I usually only eat it when my friends from Scandinavia fly into town. Korean food is a very rare delicacy in places like Norway. They like it a lot over there, but there just ain't that many places to go to. So the first thing they always wanna do is go to a Korean restaurant after they fly into McCarren.  Personally, I like Yakiniku much better than Korean BBQ. Yakiniku is practically Korean BBQ from Japan, but I didn't feel like paying $200 today, so I decided to find a cheaper alternative. 

I met an old man at Floyd Lamb a few weeks ago who told me that  Korean food has changed in the last 25 years. He told me that the Korean food that is popular today is actually a modified version of what it used to be. He also told me to come here to JUN'S because it was more similar to the type of Korean food he ate back in the 70s.  I came here today, and I did noticed that it was  different from all the other Korean restaurants in Las Vegas. I actually liked this taste a lot more. I ordered the Kalbi and thought it was one of the best I have ever had.  

You really should never get a Chicken dish from a Korean restaurant. Korean cuisine just does not specialize in Chicken.  Korean marinated chicken is practically the California Roll of Korean food. It's not a true authentic style dish.  The only times you should ever get chicken at a Korean restaurant is if it is a Chinese-Korean restaurant and they got Tang So Yuk(spelling?). 

I like how JUN's features this \"oldschool\" style of K-food, that you don't find very often anymore.  To me, it gives off more of an authentic feel. What most of Vegas locals are accustomed to is the Hawaiian-Korean style food. Sure, that's good too but I guess it's actually not real.

I ordered to-go for all my annoying Norwegian friends, and I couldn't believe how much food they gave us. When the lady handed me the bag, it literally felt like 40 pounds of food. I had a lot of trouble carrying it to my car.

 What I really like is that they have the low calorie/healthy versions of the Korean dishes. These recipes have minimal sugar and no oil in the marinades. They also have brown rice as well. 

There was absolutely nothing wrong with the customer service here like many of the Yelpers are claiming. I've been to some nightmarish Korean restaurants in my life, and this was not one of them. East-Asian people prefer to stay quiet if their English isn't perfect, and a lot of White and Black-Americans interpret that as \"rude\". People from Mainland China(not Taiwan) and Philippines may also leave comments about \"bad service\" due to the whole inter-asian rivalry.  I just don't see a problem with this place's service.

5-Stars"}
