{"text":"Went there today for lunch with a group of 7.  Not one person had anything good to say about their food.  Even the BOGO pasta person was dissatisfied.  The restaurant was practically empty and the service was extremely slow.  I had their chopped salad to start which was described as having tomatoes, bleu cheese, and prosciutto among the ingredients.  They were so sparse and tiny that it practically took a magnifying glass to see them amongst all the lousy iceberg.  A definite ripoff and disappointment.  My entree wasn't terrible--ordered off the light menu.  

Even though we specified when we ordered how we wanted the checks split; at the close of the meal, we were told by our server that their system wouldn't do that and that we should pass around the master bill and figure it out for ourselves.  After getting a manager involved and quite a lengthly wait, we finally got our totals and were out of there.  This lunch experience in a nearly empty restaurant took almost 2 hrs.  All around a huge disappointment.  I definitely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I love this place, one of my favorite restaurants in town. The service is amazing the food is amazing it's all just amazing. My fiancé and I usually come to eat maybe once or twice a month. We always leave happy and have an amazing time here. The fried zucchini is amazing along with the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer. We will be back for many many more visits. We will eventually try everything on the menu. 

Props to the chefs!"}
{"text":"The food was good...maybe just a little salty, but I've come to expect that from large chains.  and our service was good.  But seated next to us was a group of four 20-something men, three of whom were wearing \"wife-beater\" tank tops.  It was really disgusting.  I don't expect suits and ties...and I guess these days in Las Vegas even a collared shirt is asking for too much.  But wife-beaters?!  It was gross.  I find it hard to believe that maggiano's doesn't have some minimum dress standards.  I'll probably go back again one of these days, but if I see that again, I'll leave."}
{"text":"I thought  a Maggiano's at Downtown Summerlin would be similar to the past experiences I'd had at the Fashion Show restaurant.  I was sadly disappointed, not once but twice within a two and a half month timeframe.  In the latter part of the month of May, my wife and I decided we'd try the Summerlin restaurant.  The restaurant was very busy and we decided we'd dine in the bar area.  There appeared to be confusion of who would be our server and once he was identified we only saw him one time afterward.  Drinks, place settings, bread, the entrees, and desserts were served by five individuals, who consistently stated someone else would be bringing the next drink or food item.  We had to go to the bar to request refills of water, after our \"temporary\" server indicated she would be back with water and never returned.  The food was acceptable and the Rigatoni \"D\", my favorites, was as served at the Fashion Show location.  We waited approximately fifteen minutes for our check, then I asked the bartender to send our server over so that I could pay the check.  The last server apologized for the delays as the restaurant was busy.

On June 16, 2017, I decided to again give Maggiano's my business thinking the past experience was an anomaly.  Sadly, that was the case.  The first comment the server made to me was that \"we're very busy\".  I know now that is Maggiano's code for be prepared to have poor service.  Once again, service was greatly lacking.  When the server recommended a number of alcoholic beverages and I indicated our table does not drink alcohol, his facial expression was a combination of disappointment and contempt.  He did make recommendations regarding appetizers and entrees.  My party was satisfied with their food selections.  I again ordered the Rigatoni \"D\", which was the worst I'd ever ordered.  The temperature of the dish was inconsistent and the chick breast was tough.   The desserts were excellent.  My wife ordered an expresso and when it was delivered, after a lengthy wait, it was cold.  When brought to the attention of a staff member, a hot expresso was provided.  Again, after a wait of approximately fifteen minutes the check was presented.

After two negative experiences at this restaurant, I cannot in good conscious recommend this restaurant to my friends and acquaintances.  The Summerlin area has numerous Italian restaurants in the area that value their clients, have competitive prices, and serve similar dishes."}
{"text":"We went to dinner for the first time on Sunday night and had a great experience. The food and the service were both exceptional. Rachel was our server and when Dan stopped by our table he was very pleasant. We live in Ahwatukee and don't often get to Scottsdale for dinner but we will definitely be back again. We are looking forward to trying brunch on a weekend. That menu looked very good."}
{"text":"I love maggianos. The sausage and peppers are really good. The peppers are so good plus the peppers are so colorful and sweet. The food is really good. Plus the device is good and the waiters are nice. I have sat inside and outside and i actually prefer sitting outside."}
{"text":"Went for lunch as it very close to my office, they have great deals on the Pasta for buy 1 get one free. Cost is about $12 + drink. Staff is friendly and good ambiance."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a good choice.  This one is located in the Fashion Show mall pretty much across the street from the the Wynn.  Even though it's an outpost of a chain, they do a pretty good job with the food.  The veal Marsala was a generous portion and was excellently prepared.  Pastas were really good and filling.  Service was friendly and competent.  The restaurant was buzzing and filled with diners, which is always a good indicator.  A meal here will cost you much less than at a budget buster celebrity chef restaurant and the experience will be almost as good.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"C'est très très bon, on a pris 3 plats différents et chaque plat est goûteux et la quantité est au rendez vous . C'est une vine adresse à noter dans son carnet"}
{"text":"Family friendly and our favorite dinner destination in Scottsdale.   We love the food.  I suggest you check out their famous rigatoni dish, it is fantastic!  Good for little ones as well."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Maggiano's through Yelp...and it was so fast and easy!  I would highly recommend making reservations through Yelp, if it has the option.  I believe it was linked to Foursquare?? Not sure though.  

We took my mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner.  It wasn't crowded; which was great...though it got a bit crowded after 6pm.  While, we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar.  My husband got a beer and he got a little surprise!  The glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark.  It was gross.  He told the bartender and looked at it in shock.  He gladly switched it out.  

We went with the family style \"classic\" option which includes 2 appetizers, salads and desserts & 4 entrees.  We got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer.  The ceasar and spinach salad.  The chicken parm, grilled salmon, spaghetti w/ meatballs and gnocchi w/ italian sausage.  Spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert.  My favorite was the calamari, cesar salad, chicken parm and desserts...everything else is okay.  I didn't care to much for the salmon, though.  The portions were huge; had to take a lot of it home.  I didn't understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl...by the time we got it, it was melted.  Maybe they should put it in an ice bowl??  The waiter was nice and service was quick.  View is nice...oversees the Wynn properties.  There is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you; which I believe you have to tip him. 

It's a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving Italian food."}
{"text":"Very good food, packed and loud, EXPENSIVE wine & beer.

Sat. night you can't even find a place to stand sometimes, and it's very loud. Don't come here expecting to get a cheap drink, we got a margarita and a glass of wine for $20 with tip...
We decided to get one order of lasagna and one house salad to go, and it was
a) very good
b) more than enough for 2 people
c) reasonably priced
d) we had better wine at home for 1/3 the price :-)"}
{"text":"The portobello ravioli was delicious an we also enjoyed the house rigatoni! Food and service was wonderful. If you are heading this way for dinner I would suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"Great Great Great place for Italian food. I've eaten here on several occasions and everything is always top notch. Your food will always be fresh and hot right out of the oven. No need for me to go back to Olive Gar___."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here during prime dining hours. They do not respect your reservation time and it takes at least 30 minutes to even order. Save your time and just don't come during normal eating hours."}
{"text":"We went at around 6pm on a weeknight.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table for 4 but there was no wait for the tables at the bar so we opted for this.  Service was excellent.  The portions were very large for the price -- the full size pastas came in 8\"-9\" casserole dishes and about 3\" deep.  Everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes (fettuccine alfredo, baked ziti and sausage, some type of seafood pasta -- it was on the Little Italy Favorites menu).  I ordered the eggplant parmesan which I wasn't too fond of.  I found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what I'm used to.  Otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.  There was even a wedding party at the table next to ours!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service. We had a misunderstanding and thought that our resort concierge had said Maggianos would give resort guests 10% off. That was our mistake but the manager gave us the 10% off anyway! They are wonderful."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the architecture. Great staff, huge portions.  Very good prices"}
{"text":"Sehr gutes Essen zu örtlich fairen Preisen. Zu empfehlen sind insbesondere die GROSSEN \"MINI Deserts\" :) spitze!"}
{"text":"If you believe you can find fine dining in a chain restaurant in a mall, then this place is for you.  It often is crowded, there is lots of noise and bustle, and the menu is extensive.  It looks fancier than Carraba's or Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden, and the food is at least as good as those places.

It is not, however, fine dining, and the food will range from good to mediocre.  It is a pleasant enough meal, but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Does not get much better then this.  Baked sausage zita wonderful, my favorite was the oven roasted pork lion, incredible, wonderful place with wonderful food. A must go.We eat at one in North carlina, Now will try to have the nearest one in OHIO. What a great place!"}
{"text":"First time here and a great experience! Service great, food great, and the pumpkin cheesecake is amaze balls!! They have their own pastry chef in house which seems to make all the difference. My wife had the lobster covered tilapia which was better then my balsamic salmon. Coming here again"}
{"text":"Really want to give it 3 and a half.  The menu variety, portion sizes and dessert are the positives.  Being a picky italian food eater from new york marinara sauce was average as was lasagna.  The dinner for two was tremendous value as you get 2 free pasta dishes as take home on top of your dinner.. the value plus being pretty good food would bring me back"}
{"text":"Went, Listened to long, over rated style and size of meal. Like grandma's.   The server resided. 
Ate some food. Did not finish. 
Pasta not done enough. Flat bread was cold.  Sent back. They reheated same flat bread, with the piece that I had taken one bite of. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"We've done lunches here for our office and they are outstanding, so I went for dinner and drinks with a girlfriend.  Our food was outstanding and Soooo much of it.  It was crowded, but somehow noice wasn't crazy.  We had a great time, great food, great drinks!"}
{"text":"This place has an absolutely horrible policy with high chairs and boosters... They  are kid unfriendly...the food is ok and prices are ok. The service is also slow... I will not come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere.  Dishes were very generous.  The dessert sampler is to die for."}
{"text":"Great service, and very friendly staff. They cater to big \"parties\" and even have a ceperate room if you wanted to have a big \"party\". Overall I was very please and will certainly be back!  The food is de-lish! (Not to mention they have great deals for to go orders). 
Only reason I gave it four stars is because it was difficult to find the bathroom."}
{"text":"How frustrating!

Best part of today's lunch was service - Anthony, originally from Astoria Queens NYC, has been here for 8 months, sounded exactly like he should sound with the NY accent, serving in an Italian restaurant!  He was helpful, attentive, interactive and one of the best servers I've had in this city.  He also brought a sample of the soup of the day to the table for tasting prior to ordering.  Very attentive service - bravo, Anthony!

Food?  Very mixed reviews.  The tilapia special was thoroughly enjoyed by both diners at our table who ordered it.  Note to kitchen - the portion sizes on the two plates was noticably different (although the smaller portion did happen to go to the lighter eater so it wasn't a problem).  If the same dish is going to two people at the same table, they plates should look alike!

I started with the minestrone soup (a menu staple) and while the flavor was good, it was tepid when served.  Made me sad.  My meatball sandwich was also a bit lukewarm and heavy on the salt.  It just didn't taste as fresh as I wanted.

This lunch was a birthday celebration so the lemon cookies with two dramatic candles was a very nice end to the meal.  And the cookies were great - not too sweet, enough lemon flavor without being bitter and enough to share around the table.

Note on the door says that as of Feb 1, this will be a smoke free establishment."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but it's delicious, you can't deny it. Love their salads and the Rigatoni D."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is the place.  I had my best Vegas meal here.  Everything was great, from the complimentary bread and balsalmic/olive oil to my entrée, a meat lasagna.  Our sangria was really good as well.  There was also a gentleman walking around the restaurant with a guitar singing to guest.  Awesome experience."}
{"text":"The bread is always warm and fresh. The balsamic on the table is just enough balsamic to make your taste buds giggle when dipped in a mixture of olive oil with the bread,then transform into delicious savory hug as it cascades down your throat. All the Italian food from the salad (my favorite) to the pasta tastes authentic and flavorful. The atmosphere is inviting, homey yet elegant and everyone who I've have the pleasure of being served by has been polite and personable. It's awesome. GO."}
{"text":"OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni \"D\".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.

I am definitely going here again, what a find!"}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion Show Mall. We came here on a Sunday night for dinner. We didn't have reservations but lucky to get a table right away. We ordered linguine & clams (white sauce) and chicken marsala. They were very generous with clams in the linguine and it was very flavorful. Chicken Marsala came out to be very delicious as well. The chicken was cooked to perfection, very tender and we loved the marsala sauce with mushrooms. The portions are huge and we think the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Not great like it used to be!  First, bathroom was out of toilette paper and hand soap.  Sunday for dinner 6pm, they are out of meatballs and chocolate syrup for chocolate milk for the kids and for desserts...  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a refill on bread, service was meh...  Overpriced and corporate."}
{"text":"We had a small wedding dinner here for my daughter and her husband last weekend.  The food was excellent as well as the service. The portions were great and everyone really enjoyed themselves.  Thanks Maggiano's for a great time!"}
{"text":"My whole wheat penne pasta was a bit tough and a little cold , the meat ball came out separate instead of with my meal , the mussels were good ! And the guys veal porter house was tasty and nicely prepared , the dessert platter was the best part !"}
{"text":"Paid a visit over 4 years ago for high school homecoming.

The server insisted on telling me what was standard tipping.

That was some of the most extreme unprofessionalism I have ever experienced at a restaurant. 

On another note, the Veal is good.

Just be kind to the young, we work in restaurants too."}
{"text":"This a nice spot in the shopping centre away from the casino cacophony. It is a bit of an adventure getting there due to construction along the strip and around the mall. Despite this minor inconvenience, we were welcomed by the bartender and directed to a 4-top table.

Waters and cocktails were ordered to battle the slight hangover from previous eve's shenanigans.

The menu is varied but not overdone offering traditional Italian meals. The 4 of us places our orders. I went for the chicken parm sandwich. All our food arrived at once, hot and fresh.

My sandwich was good - nicely seasoned! My dining companions commented similarly regarding their meals.

Maggianos opens on to the mall for post-meal shopping and to walk off a good meal!"}
{"text":"Even though I've lived in Scottsdale for several years, it took a trip to Las Vegas to find out about Maggiano's. I had no idea they were a chain, until I looked them up online. Our experience in Vegas' Maggianno's was five stars, but I only gave the Scottsdale restaurant four stars because I feel the dessert portion sizes are much larger in Vegas. And they also have these amazing mints in Vegas. So if I could give Scottsdale Maggiano's 4.5 stars I would. I've always had great service there the three times I've been there. We recently went there for a birthday party of ten people. When I first called to make reservations the guy told me that we had to do family style because the cutoff was nine. So when we called a second time, they said no problem ordering off the classic pasta menu. It's a great promotion. You get one hot meal in the restaurant, and one cold meal to take home with you. Granted the second meal isn't as large as the first one, but you get twice as much food as if you were to order family style. Let's face it, who can eat all you can eat? It's expensive $30 a plate and we had mostly older people and small children, thus the classic pastas made more sense. It's my understanding that you can't take home doggie bags of family style meals either. Their desserts are great. We tried the sampler on our most recent trip and had Creme bruleé, a fruit tart with a great crust, tiramasu, and a chocolate dessert. I don't remember the other two~   When we went there in Vegas it was their fall menu and they served this pumpkin cheesecake with a pecan crust. It was AMAZING!!!! And the size of the slice was enough to feed four people. But the place in Scottsdale was a sliver of a piece. That's was a let down. They do have the recipe online though so you can make it at home. I love the inside. And though it is a chain, I give it three thumbs up. Much better than Carrabba's. 

Their lasagna is out of this world, so is their four cheese ravioli, and I think the other one was called Pasta Pomodoro. I'll go back again and again until I feel it's not worth it anymore. This last visit was great with one person giving all ten of us great service. Mary Ann was her name I think . Was even able to use a coupon that they sent me. 

Lots of coupons if you get on their mailing list. Oh one more thing, Yelp has them on the wrong side of Scottsdale road on their map. It's on the SE corner."}
{"text":"Carryout was very good!! Rigatoni D and Lasagna (meat) were excellent. It's nice the way bread and butter are included without having to ask for it. Best part of the meal? Lemon cookies!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 12 people to celebrate my graduation in mid-december.  We made reservations a month ahead of time and preordered our food.  Maggiano's has this great option where we can order a number of appetizers, main dishes, desserts and serve family style with unlimited refills.  We thought this would be a nice dinner and we could keep the cost manageable. 

Our group arrives at the restaurant and we are told the table is \"almost ready\".  An HOUR later, we were seated.  No one apologized for the wait, nor did they offer to give us a drink or anything while we waited.  My group was getting cranky waiting for a table that we reserved a month ahead of time.  Granted, it was mid-december when holiday parties are frequent, but a restaurant should be able to figure out their tables and staff needs in order to prepare for this.

When we were seated, we immediately told the manager on duty of our wait and he made it up to us by offering an additional food at no charge.

Our foods were served and it was very tasty.  So tasty that we requested a few \"refills\" on our main dishes.  We waited, and waited but they never came.  Then they started clearing off our dishes and bringing dessert.  Well...so much for dinner.  Then they tell us that they ran out of vanilla ice cream (again, we preordered our meal a month ahead of time) and that they will be substituting our apple crisp with spumoni ice cream.  WHY didn't the restaurant portion off some of the vanilla ice cream for us, because they knew we preordered it?!  On top of that, spumoni ice cream on apple crisp sounds absolutely disgusting.

As we were eating our dessert, i notice our waitress at the far end of the tables putting food in take out boxes.  When I got her attention I asked what she was doing and she said \"I'm putting the dinner refills in take out boxes\"....um....we had requested the dinner refills because we were HUNGRY and wanted to eat more, right now.  Instead you took our dinner dishes and started serving dessert.  So then she got new plates, opened the take out boxes and put them on the table so we could continue eating the main dishes.  How tacky!!!  Everyone in our group was annoyed by this, and by that point, we were so annoyed by the service and sheer lack of common sense that we told her to repackage it.  It wasn't worth finishing our desserts and eating more dinner.

This was supposed to be a fun night for me and my group.  I just graduated and wanted to share this special milestone with my loved ones.  Maggiano's completely ruined the night.  

We did notify the manager, for the second time that evening and he did adjust our final bill.  However, that did not make things better.  After this incident, we decided to write a letter to the general manager of Maggiano's who did credit a substantial portion of the bill back to our credit card.  This was kind and we did appreciate that.  But my biggest concern is that this might happen to another happy family celebrating a milestone.  I will always remember my graduation dinner as a total nightmare.

If you have a large party...beware...."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Service was good. Food was great. First time we used the yelp reservation system, and it worked perfect, we were seated right away."}
{"text":"When to Apple store and decided to eat here. Very good service and food was good. Need to come out on hot plate will make world of difference. Ordered meal for two and was surprised to get two meals to eat now and take two meals for tomorrow. We asked her to pack 3 meals.to go and was full with one meal.Great food and great service. Will go.back.again fo sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here this afternoon. We both had Moms Lasagna, mine with marinara & my husband's with meat sauce.  It was amazing.  The homemade lasagna noodles were \"delicate,\" not chewy.  The sauce was extremely  flavorful.  We will make this a must stop on every trip to Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The waiter was great. He explained to us in detail what the food was. I highly recommend this place. Everything I ate here was good. I have a great experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"A must have! My husband and I had the lasagna and the chef Mann's country style pasta- two completely different dishes but both equally delicious and comforting. Visually beautiful, an array of textures, and the smell.... Mmmmmm. 

The staff was quick and courteous. We hardly waited at all for seating and food (we arrived at 3pm).  Oh and while we didn't take advantage of it this time- they offer a nice happy hour menu."}
{"text":"My sister, who lives in Vegas, took me here with her friends when I was visiting. With so many options on the strips, I was wondering why this was one of her favorites. Located in the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has easy access and parking. It has a great location. 

The ambiance is just like every other Maggianos, with only about 1/3 of the tables having a view of the strip. We had made reservations for 8:00pm on a Wednesday night, and arrived 10 minutes late. Granted the restaurant was packed as ever, but there were empty tables. The Maître de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar. We waited for almost another 25 minutes, are you kidding me? 

When we were finally seated at a table in the back, it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order. Maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter. We could see that he was working hard, but we were hungry as well! The food was delicious, as expected. All of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. We actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table =) The one with the Violin reminded us of the man in UP. With such good food, we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day. 

But then, at the end of the night when we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests. One of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip. This is before we got the receipt back to sign. The waiter assumed, and gave himself a 25% tip! That has never happened to me before, and sadly I have to say he didn't deserve it. Overall we had a great time and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope they would improve on their service between then."}
{"text":"If you don't want to eat at the food court then it's a good choice.  Maggiano's  also offers a little more reserved dining than the cheese cake factory which sits across the promenade.   We don't eat Italian out much (both having grown up  with parents once removed from the old country and with additional family living in Boston's North End where Italian restaurants and bakeries hire cousin joey for the sole reason he can speak English),  so we're hard to please being transplanted in the south.  
The décor is nice and it was fairly quiet.  You notice that most of the wait staff are young people.  Our waiter spoke so softly we had to tell him to speak up.  He was a little eccentric and seemed to be inexperienced somewhat but he was pleasant and caring.  We enjoyed having him serve us.   We walked in at 3:15 and received the dinner menu which mirrors the lunch but more money.  The food was leagues above your normal run of the mill chain Italian restaurant as the likes of a Carrabba's \"Italian Grill\".  
We started with stuffed mushrooms.  These were to be spinach, garlic with breadcrumbs.  I was looking forward to these.  They came six on the plate, decent size caps with a nice browning on the top and were absolutely tasteless.  BUMMA!   Not only were they tasteless but my wife spit out what looked like a piece of wrapping that was baked into the middle. Whatever it was, it was definitely plastic and therefore not digestible.  We brought it to our waiters attention who inspected it and said with a straight face \"that's disgusting\" followed by and apology and quickly removed the plate.  After he left we chuckled as it was quite humorous.  Don't think his manager would choose to have him say the word disgusting to diners!  Our waiter quickly returned to the table to notified us he had told the manager and \"put it into his hands\" so we should be hearing from him.  Again he made us laugh since he was obviously more grossed out than my wife and wanted no part of it.   The manager came shortly after and offered us a fresh order or something else free of charge.  We politely declined and thank him for his offer.  I had the chicken parm and it came with a side of spags.  The parm had a marinara sauce and the spags a house tomato. The menu read;  Chicken Parmesan Provolone & Marinara Sauce with Spaghetti  Marinara.   I'm assuming the sauces start off with the same base that gets shipped out to the 22 states they're in and they season from there.   The house on my side was most likely a mix up out back.  The marinara was decent!   I thought it could have used a little more oregano but I'm a huge fan of oregano.  I complain to my mom for not using enough.  The house was a little sweet for me and I only had a few forkfuls.  The chicken was thinly sliced from frozen cutlet with a piece of provolone on the top and baked.  Although from frozen, it was decent.  I ate them all.  My wife had the eggplant and she said it was decent too.  It came on a bed of spags and was more than enough for late lunch.  
Our check came with a take home order and a piece of cheese cake on the house.  The mushrooms had been deducted from our check.  We added the 9.95 mushroom deduct to the tip because the waiter made us smile and seemed like a good kid.
This was our first time to a Maggiano's.   It's unlikely we will return to Maggiano's.  If you're going out to dinner during your shopping and don't feel like the food court then it's in the running.  I can't see anyone driving to Maggiano's for dinner. There are way better choices all around the south park area.    I did see that they had family style portions on the menu and looks like it may be a good place for special occasions and/or large groups."}
{"text":"Greetings, 

BEST ITALIAN IN VEGAS!!!  I recently visited Sin City and decided to get a late dinner at Maggiano's Little Italy. I would like to start by saying I've never had better service for a late Italian Dinner in my life.

We showed up at 10:00 and basically shut this place down, but not before we met the server of the century, Jake!

The food was outstanding and it was as if Jake new exactly what myself and my other wanted the moment we walked in.  Hands-down the best attention to detail I've experienced.  

If you ever find yourself ready for a late Italian Dinner, this is the spot!  Ask for Jake, ask him a question and he has a long answer! 

As for other highly rated main-stream Italian joints, they have nothing on this place and best part about it, below they have Dollar you call it drinks!

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were in Las Vegas for a mini-get-away. We came here for dinner on Sunday night. Him and I were watching the Seahawks vs. 49ers game at the hotel, came here at half time, and were able to get the perfect seat to watch the rest of the game. 

I'm not sure if the waitress was training someone new or if the other person that helped was just the bus girl but she was more attentive than the waitress. If just the waitress helped us, I would have said the service is lacking, but since the other lady was there to fill up our drink and bring us menus and take our plates away, I would say it was between average and good. 

The food was great. I had the mushroom ravioli. The sauce was delicious. My husband tried it also and thought it was really good. My husband had the lasagna. He thought it was good. The sauce was a little sweeter than I like but it was good. 

Overall this is a good restaurant. Good place to stop for a good meal. The prices were reasonable. Check one of Las Vegas's tour books. We saw it after but there was a coupon to get $10 off if you spend $30."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come to Maggiano's stopped by this past mother's day. Every time my family decides to go here I get so excited.  The food is always a good choice we usually order family style which is more than enough for 5 of adults. 

They don't hold back refills on entrees or drinks, so we always leave with even more food. Here you'll get your money's worth the food never stops coming the service is great and the waiters always go above and beyond. It's an all around welcoming restaurant perfect for the ultimate Sunday family dinner. The pound cake with ice cream, bananas, and chocolate makes it even better."}
{"text":"When in Rome do as the Romans, when in fashion show mall eat at Maggianos.  the fired zucchini app is my wife's favorite item on the menu.  Portions are large and certainly shareable for lunch and dinner leftovers will be available the following day.  I like this place a lot..."}
{"text":"Buy one get one to take home? No, thank you! While it is a very nice gesture, it is not worth another blah experience. Fried calamari was always very greasy. Baked ziti is ok but kind of dry not good for take home. Maggiano does a little better in terms of having quality sauce and fresh bread  than Buca de \"Popo.\" Oh I agree with Andrew, H. host staff are always stuffy and act like they have some earth shattering tasks to attend to instead of welcoming guests and making customers feel welcomed. We will be back if we have nowhere else to go."}
{"text":"OMG! I came to visit Maggiano's for the first time and I can't even begin to speak wonders of this place! Not only was the server Mike on point! He was very knowledgeable about the menu and very welcoming. He recommended a few favorites which we tried and I am extremely pleased with him and his service. I Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We recently hosted a large event, utilizing the banquet facilities at Maggianos. The catering manager, Erin, and her assistant, Liane, are incredible people to work with. They are beyond accommodating. Every single request I made, was answered positively and happily. I was very nervous, as my family had been planning this day for a long time and I wanted everything to be perfect. Erin put my mind completely at ease. I was making changes up until the day of the event and the staff there had no problem with it. The banquet staff worked with all of my various vendors to make sure everything worked just the way I had envisioned it. The stress was taken off of my shoulders because I knew I was in good hands. Erin has a \"no problem, we'll make it happen\" attitude, which is so refreshing. 
On the day of our event, the banquet staff was amazing. Alyssa, our captain, made certain we had everything we needed. The bartenders were fantastic. Our banquet server (either Jacob or Brandon, I can't remember the name) was always on the spot. The night could not have been more perfect. My guests were blown away with the service, not to mention the outstanding food. Everything was delicious. 
If you are needing a venue to host a special event, meeting, etc., this is the way to go. I cannot stop beaming. Erin and her team at Maggiano's are beyond compare!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm from a suburb of Chicago, and we also have this chain. Oddly enough, the food in the Chicago location is better. With that said, we still enjoyed the lasagna, and salad. By far the best restaurant we ate at on our visit to the area. We may be a little spoiled as Chicago is a foodie city. The wait staff could not do enough :) Nice job!"}
{"text":"My nephew the budding chef invited us for his birthday dinner. He had made reservations 3 days in advance. The party was a large party of about 20 people. I've been to enough restaurants to know that a party this size is usually tag teamed by 2 or more of the wait staff. And that appeared to be what was happening when we first sat down. Then there was some confusion, and they asked for our orders again. Then one of the waitresses never appeared again. 

My husband received his cola and some of the folks at the other end of the table received their drinks, but our drinks didn't come for quite some time. Our water was empty, still no drinks, and they hadn't taken our dinner order yet. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Finally our drinks come, and then she disappears and more waiting, and then she takes our orders. 

While we did have poor service, I don't believe it was solely the waitress' fault. There seemed to be kitchen issues as well. Our dishes came out one or two at a time. It was really odd.  Eventually, out came ONE (of 3) order of calamari. You would think everything else was on it's way, no, more waiting. Finally, another couple of plates came out, people were trying to figure out if they should be polite and wait, or eat because by then it was past 10pm. 

It went on like this for another 3 hours....yes 3...we were the only table left in the restaurant and we hadn't been served completely. Finally the poor waitress is trying to close people out on the tab, while still trying to serve people. I asked her if there wasn't anyone that could help her as she couldn't very well be expected to be in two places. She said there really wasn't and that was what happened. 

People were still trying to pay, one couple and ourselves still didn't have part of our meal or our dessert. There were two gentlemen that appeared to be waitstaff. I asked one of them if someone could possibly help our by now frazzled waitress. He said there wasn't. I gave him an incredulous look and said, \"can't you see she can't possibly do this by herself and needs help\". He begrudgingly agreed to help by getting the remaining portions of our meals, sat them down with a plunk and a look that said he was not happy about helping. 

The 1 star is for operational process and service. The food was really quite good, but I was in so much pain from sitting for so long that I couldn't enjoy it. I don't think I have ever seen a restaurant where one person was left on their own with a huge party, and other staff just walking around watching them."}
{"text":"Gave it a try based on Yelp reviews.  We had a vegi pasta dish and a Salmon dish.  Both were very good and the price was very reasonable for such a nice restaurant on the strip.   Good service as well.    Underground parking is just around the corner."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the food is amazing.  I usually don't order lasagna at restaurants because I end up being disappointed.  The lasagna in meat sauce is great.  Their spaghetti with meatballs is delicious as well.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer is really tasty.  You cant leave without trying their apple crostada for desert."}
{"text":"While being seated, hostess realized no table was ready. We had to stand in the dinging room for 10 minutes while others worked around us.

Food order was taken even before we got our first drink.

Main course was served not more than 5 minutes after our appetizers arrived.  One person at our table had not even received her salad yet. 
 
One entree was served after several persons were already done with dinner.

We specifically asked for a candle to celebrate a birthday. Dessert served was wrong and with no candle.  

Manager apology \"We were not as busy as usual so the kitchen's rhythm is off tonight.\"  What?  really?

The first bill we received was at the full price..we had to ask for a partial refund.

AVOID this place."}
{"text":"I always love to go with family and enjoy a lovely light or heavy meal. Very good Italian food. I have had a tour of the kitchen and it's very clean, they always take out any old food. They have fresh herbs for you to pick to put on your meal. They make all of there pastas, bread, and grow most of there vegetables. Go with family, friend, and even business. Gets very busy after lunch and for dinner. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great meal. But what really put our dining experience over the top was our server Stacey. Every recommendation, from apps to dessert was spot on. Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome.  Their food is delicious and it's a great place for a group because they have an incredible family style option.  My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here several years ago and it was phenomenal.  Our guests loved it and the service was superb.  We had a nice room in the back and truly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. My chicken marsala was freaking perfect!! The sauce was the perfect balance between savory and sweet and the mushrooms were so delicious. My date had the chicken francesca and he enjoyed it so much he forgot to save me a bite! By the time we were finished with the meal we were so full but the waitress talked us into order some dessert. We ended up getting the sampler/ one serving dessert. He tried the cheesecake and I tried the butter cake. Mine was the winner we both enjoyed it immensely. The service was really good very prompt and the wait time for the food was good too it was perfect timing between our soup/ salads to our meal."}
{"text":"I was there on Mother's Day for dinner we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. We somehow got both at the same time instead of receiving our appetizer first then the server and food runner started arguing."}
{"text":"Two stars for the low quality of food.

My friends and i decided to spend our last dinner in vegas at Maggianos. It was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some REAL food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs. It is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around 11-17 bucks while a full order will cost you 20+. 

They do encourage family style for tables of 4+, but i think the cheapest family style was still around 20 a person. 

Out of the four of us we ordered: spaggetti with meatballs, lobster alfredo, fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams. All of the dishes were tasteless. I had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt  and all my friends did too. Maybe the chef forgot about the salt??  Idk, although the pasta were tasteless, the seafood was fresh and the bread was pretty good too. 

Meh, I've experienced better is the perfect description for this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in las vegas! Their balcony is the best place to eat and its always nice going to a restaurant connected to fashion show mall since its close by after shopping. My favorite thing on their menu is their seafood linguine! Their chocolate cake and latte is really good as well."}
{"text":"What a spectacular place. Ambiance was perfect, food was more than delicious and our server (Courtney from Chicago/Dallas) had absolute impeccable service. As a chef, I tend to be tough when it comes to dining out, but this place exceeded my expectations in every way. The only horrible and downright disappointing aspect of the whole night was when it came to singing Happy Birthday to my Wife. One of the patrons we were dining with saw the manager by the name of Marcus at this particular location walking by and said to him \"Hey, help us to sing Happy Birthday\", with a very brash and unfriendly tone, Marcus replied \"I don't have time to do that right now\" and walked away. I totally understand the rigor and rush of working in a restaurant, but there is a way that you should speak to customers. I don't think 30 seconds out of his time to sing Happy Birthday would have been detrimental. Needless to say the shock value of that, especially coming from a manager killed the entire rest of the night. The great food will have me returning again in the future....Hopefully Manager Marcus will have a better attitude when dealing with paying patrons."}
{"text":"I would MAYBE come here for happy hour and appetizers but we didn't enjoy our dinner at all. I ordered the chicken piccata and it came literally drowned in butter. I know it's a lemon butter sauce but it was ALL butter and very little lemon - and zero flavor. The broccolini was also drowned in butter. My husband ordered the veal porterhouse and guess what? It was drowned in butter. He said it was also flavorless. The other couple with were with ordered the baked ziti (HUGE!) and chicken Alfredo (HUGE!) and they weren't enamored either. The food was absolutely terrible, bland and heavy. Maybe their plain red sauces are where it's at, I don't know. The bruschetta was really good and the service was excellent as well - judging from the other reviews maybe we got lucky with a good waitress. Oh, and the valet situation - what a nightmare! Cars parked everywhere, stupid valet kid left someone door open while he ran around so no one could pass...cars totally bottle necked and stuck - it took us 15 minutes to get through and find parking!Total chaos."}
{"text":"WORST service ever! this place cannot handle groups that are 4 or more. Food did not come until almost two hours later. Waiter never checked on the table. It was really dissapointingbforboutprvtable of 8."}
{"text":"This is the worst Italian restaurant I have ever been to. The fettuccine Alfredo I ordered was so bland, I had to season it and even then still had no taste ! The pasta was also overlooked. 
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was good.  My service was terrible.  Had to ask 3 times to get water refilled.   Bald server was the worst I've had.    90 bill and I  still tipped him 20%...lol.  worst service ever"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. The food is amazing , great quality, great location , positive environment. Staff is every helpful which makes the experience great . Fast & friendly ! I would recommend this place to anyone , great for locals & visitors ! Suits all occasions whether it's a romantic date or a night out with the whole family !! 
Brandon was our server which is awesome & Christy , the manager was very polite !
Love this place !"}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner

Food was great - my kids have never been there before and all said they couldn't wait to come back.  Not a HUGE pasta fan but there were lots of options (veggie,seafood, chicken and beef).  If you like Eggplant Parmesan you will enjoy it at Maggiano's"}
{"text":"Myself and my date went here for lunch, he said the one in Atlanta was pretty good and thought  the Charlotte location shouldn't be too bad either. WRONG! We had to sit and wait about 35min for our appetizer to come out and felt like another 45minutes before our entree to arrive. The food was not all that good, had better frozen food meals than what we had. The stuffed mushrooms were the only thing that was satisfying. The manager did come out and apologize and gave us a free dessert with our meal, but I will def not be back."}
{"text":"Yummy. Parmesan in crusted Talapia, momma's lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, Cesar salad. 4.5 to 5 stars from all four of us. Fettuccine Alfredo is a huge portion."}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding dinner party. So considering that they were serving a party of about 25 they did an awesome job. We had so much food I must have gained 5 lbs leaving there. We had a variety of different dishes from spinach-artichoke dip, bruschetta, lasagna, spaghetti, fetticuni alfredo - I can't even remember the rest. But it was very good - ALL OF IT! The servers served all of us quickly, the food was hot and delicious and the ambiance was very romantic!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple months ago during my vacation in Las Vegas. I was skeptical to try Maggiano's out since they were a chain restaurant but I would be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately no locations in Canada (where I'm from) yet! This Maggianos is located in the Fashion show mall next to Wynn and Encore Hotels. 

Maggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. It has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the Wynn hotel and that part of the strip. While we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. And to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!

The menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. Along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. Basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! Its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. We ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.

Maggiano's Salad : 
This salad is literally the best salad I've ever had! The signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, I could NOT for the life of me stop eating this!

Crispy Zucchini Fritte : 
The waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and I can see why. The zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip

Linguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce: 
I did not like this at all. The sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. It was way too salty.

Our Famous Rigatoni 'D' ® :
 guess they don't call it \"Famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy Marsala sauce. 

For a chain, this place really isn't bad! You'll leave for the most part happy and full :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time and it was wonderful. Each of us had a different entree and each one was very good, plus you get an entree to take home. Of coarse this was for only certain ones. Our waitress, Mandy, was friendly, attentive and had the biggest smile. It would be well worth returning.  The prices were good too."}
{"text":"Food was great, however the practice of adding dollars to the credit card bill is not something I appreciate. 

My total was 19.40, I noted down 23 on the receipt and somehow I got charged 24.40. Italian mob procedure, eh?"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Jan 31. I cannot have gluten or dairy. After asking the waiter what he would recommend, he had Chef Eric come to our table to talk about what dishes would best fit my dietary recommendations. He took my order on a bright yellow order pad and said it would be prepared separately. They have gluten free pasta and the meat sauce is dairy free. Everyone was so helpful and my meal was fabulous. Hubs got the regular spaghetti & meatballs and said was delish. Both meals came out at the same time and we enjoyed our dinner very much. Price very reasonable compared to the pricey resorts. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here last night and had a great experience! Our server did a fantastic job in my opinion she was very attentive and personable.  She wasn't overly formal which is a weird pet peeve of mine. Our waters were always full, drinks refilled and table clean.  

Onto the food. We started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing! They were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort. Very delicious. My boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter, but I thought they were perfect. We asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both. They too were very good! Very different from each other which I thought was nice.

I ordered the Chicken Francese, I think that's how it's spelled, with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes. It was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what I would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce. Idk but it was good! Not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion. I saved one chicken breast to take home because I wanted some later.

My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with.  It had an odd sweet flavor to it. We took most of it home with us and never touched it after that. 

Overall it was a good experience! I definitely will be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and beautiful restaurant at very reasonable prices!  It's very affordable for a five star restaurant.  You'd pay way more anywhere else for this nice of a restaurant.  They were also surprisingly very kid friendly!  Love this place, I hope their location near my home is just as good."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and a great ambiance. I dont know the prices or menu options because we ate here for a wedding rehearsal. The food was great and so was the service. Our waiter and waitress were very professional. I would recommend this place. Its the best Italian food I have had this side of the country!!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Christmas Eve, I called 2 weeks in advance, it was for a party of 5 and the reservation was for 7 pm. We arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation.
The place was crowded but I wasn't concerned as we had a reservation. 30 minutes later I was very concerned as we still hadn't been seated. I had checked with the reservation desk twice already and was brushed off quite rudely both times, especially by a tall dark haired young man. 
Apparently there were quite a few people who were also very upset with this restaurant  many others were also kept waiting . 
Finally after 45 minutes we were seated. We ordered an appetizer and that came pretty quickly but we had to wait another 30 minutes for our main meal and when it came it looked messy and kind of thrown together.
All in all not a pleasant experience.
I was hoping to make this a Christmas tradition ( we had done this Christmas of 2013 and that wasn't to bad that's why we came back) but this experience, coupled with the rudeness of the reservation desk has changed my mind.
This coming Christmas we will find another restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great. We were seated rather quickly, but had a bad table. We constantly had to move to let others pass. We all shared a plate of Bruschetta and a complimentary plate of fried Zucchini.
Our meals came out nice and hot. I would recommend the Mushroom Ravioli for vegetarians and others!
Great place for a birthday group."}
{"text":"Friends made reservations here for dinner and I expected the usual high Las Vegas prices and brusque service. I was pleasantly surprised in that the service was excellent and the food was super-delicious. 

I tried one of the pasta specialties with chicken and shrimp and it was excellent for only $18.50. Everyone else commented on how good their food was. 

I highly recommend Maggiano's for a fantastic Italian dinner in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. I'm looking forward to my next dinner there!"}
{"text":"I show my customers your restaurant every time I go to Encore Wynn . I'm a chauffeur for Las Vegas limousine and I sure hope it's as good as I tell everybody it is :-)"}
{"text":"Been here many times. They have lunch special on pasta buy one and take one with you. Food is average to good. I will definitely good there again."}
{"text":"We eat here every time in Vegas.  It very consistent.  It is very good for large groups as it serves the traditional large sizes.  Service is always good, food is always good.  My noodles were a little over cooked this time so I knocked them down to a 4 star otherwise they are 5 star all the way."}
{"text":"Great service! Plus they have gluten free options Which is GREAT!! The food is fresh, well seasoned and extra tasty. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I just love Maggiano's. Not usually a fan of big chains, but I just love them. I have one close to where I live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate. 

While in Vegas with my family, I insisted we have a big family meal at Maggiano's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. 

We arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. The place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. That sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.

Our server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.

The food was fantastic. I ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. However, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it's served with. The little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip. 

My eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. Unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. A small family could have shared it (I have a big family....haha). It was just perfect. I'm not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. It couldn't have been better, honestly. Four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband's lunch the next day. It was even delicious cold!

For desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. It had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....I can't remember the last one. It was so pretty- and only $9.95. The whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. I'm not a fan of sweets, so I only nibbled a couple things. My sister said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.

All in all, it was a fantastic night. I remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Everything was Better than I expected!!  JEREMY and BOB made our small wedding reception so special!!  My husband and I could not have asked for more.  The arrangements and the Barolo Room were PERFECT for our family and friends!! We were all impressed by the wonderful food and atmosphere!!  We would do it all over again and again!!  We will definitely be back for many anniversaries!!  
Thanks to Everyone!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a company holiday party on 12/19/2015.  The servers were very helpful and quick to accommodate the needs of the guests.  Since it was a company party, the food was prepared, and presented in a \"family style,\" by which I mean that they brought out large plates of a particular entrée for each table.  The party menu included: Calamari Fritti, Stuffed Mushrooms, Mozzarella Marinara, Chicken Parmesan, Chicken & Ricotta Meatballs, Linguine di Mare, and Gnocchi & Italian Sausage.

All of the appetizers and entrees were delicious, but my favorite of the group was the Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken was fresh and juicy and the sauce was absolutely amazing!  In the main dinning room, the atmosphere was fairly loud, but we were sitting back in the private group area which was clean, well-lit, and well-maintained.  The bartender that was in the room, and assigned to the group was friendly and hilarious which helped make the party that much better!

In the main dinning room, the establishment has seating to accommodate all different sized parties and groups.  The lighting in the dinning room helps to add to the ambience of the experience.  The facilities at the restaurant were clean and easily accessible.  It was a bit loud in the dinning room, but there were several families and groups that were seated in the area when I walked through.

Whether you are looking for a place to host a group event, or an evening out with the family, I would highly recommend Maggiano's Little Italy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time for our anniversary. We are very picky when it comes to italian food. We are from CT and since we moves to Charlotte I just make my own Italian to avoid being let down.  The food at Maggianos does not taste like chain italian food. It was amazing. You can taste the quality ingredients in each course. Also the bar makes good drinks as well.  We also had a wonderful waitress named Ana. I am going back!"}
{"text":"The mocha alone got me! Served with a dark chocolate chip biscotti..mmm!

Plating is something similar to out of great-grandma's kitchen; \"pretty\", trendy, or exotic in appearance, but food is good and portions are appropriate,

Shrimp and crab cannelloni perfectly seasoned!"}
{"text":"My husband and I hosted our wedding reception here after a wonderful ceremony at the Wynn. It turned out to be a great decision.

Location-wise, it was very easy for our guests to get to from the Wynn. We had a couple of older relatives, and being able to drive up to the valet area and drop them off was super.

Planning - the banquet staff was responsive and accommodating. They also took care of everything - saving us the hassle of trying to manage multiple vendors. We selected the cocktail reception package. After signing the initial contract, the only other planning we had to do was answer the occasional email about headcount or food and beverage choices.

Facilities- beautiful banquet room. Our decorations were minimal (some flowers on the tables), but that's all the place really needed. Maggiano's let us drop off the decorations the morning-of, and the banquet staff did a knock-out job of decorating the room for us. We rented out all 3 portions of the banquet room, which was great for our 100-person reception. We also got access to the terrace, which was great for the smokers, let us enjoy a view of the strip, and kept the temperature perfect for the event.

Food & staff - amazing. Everyone loved the food. The staff was quick to respond when food ran out in the banquet lines - new food came out fresh and hot. Bar tending staff was awesome - no one waited in line very long. Also, the staff made my husband, myself, and our photographer \"to go\" boxes with extra food because they were afraid we didn't get enough to eat. How awesome is that?

Do yourself a favor and let the awesome staff at Maggiano's handle your reception. Professional, painless, and the end to a perfect day."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner over the weekend and man my experience here was really good!  The place was really kept nice, real clean and the staff was incredible.  I had the New York Steak 16oz.  which was amazing, our waiter Taylor did a real good job waiting on us and always kept coming back to see if we needed water or anything else.  Overall I would recommend this place if your in town and want to dine on some good italian food."}
{"text":"Just got back from a wedding in Vegas where the reception was held at Maggiano's. The atmosphere inside is elegant, but comfortable. The private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. The service during the reception was stellar. I told our bartender/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. She knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. I had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. Then I enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. Oh my God, it was out of this world. I need to go to the Maggiano's and Tampa ASAP to have this again. Finally for dessert, I had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. The meal was unbelievable!! Kudos to the staff and chef at Maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. I have not visited an Italian restaurant since I learned of my allergy but now I absolutely have to go back to Maggiano's.  If you are in Vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay."}

{"text":"Made a Reservation here Saturday night to celebrate my birthday dinner after hearing great things about the food. Reservation was for 8:45pm and we got there at 8:30pm. Waited for about 45 minutes until going inside to ask the hostess how much longer. We also asked \"what was the point of making the reservation if we had to wait for so long anyways?\" the supervisor said that \"If we didn't like it, then we could call and complain about it.\" So after no apology or the supervisor even offering to check on the table for us, we left very unhappy. Ended up going to a Mexican place next to it where we were seated immediately and the food was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"Very large portions and excellent food and service. Easy to take leftovers home that taste great the next day."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and I just loved the Lobster Carbonara! Didn't even first realize that Magginano's is a national chain of restaurants - usually they are far from this good."}
{"text":"Maybe Valentine day overwhelmed the kitchen and that it why our order was hours late and not what I ordered. 
Waiter apparently knew it was wrong order but did not want kitchen to correct it and have us wait longer. Waiter did offer us free dessert. I wished I left it. I ordered Double chocolate brownie. The brownie was dry and tasted bad. The strawberries were still frozen. Only thing good about it was the ice cream.  We were there for three hours. We had reservations and it took them 30 minutes to seat us, we placed our order fairly promptly and then waited for the wrong meal; another 45 minutes for terrible dessert and more minutes to pay the bill. Not the Valentines dinner I had hoped for."}
{"text":"After a long day and nite of work, headed to Maggiano's for a late nite supper.  Small side salad...GOOD...Spaghetti w/ marinara...GOOD...Portions...HUGE...

Waiter was really nice too, even though we came late and stayed late."}
{"text":"Had lunch today, and the service was terrible. Bumbling around, and sweating. The food was good as usual, but service needs some work. I will come back on the pure odds I won't get him again."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is truly a 5 star establishment. Recently my son's wedding reception was held at Maggiano's and it was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious, service was fantastic, and location was perfect.  Any questions or potential concerns we may have had were addressed immediately and satisfied. Beth the banquet manager was amazing and went beyond to help make this a great memory for my son, daughter, mom, and our guest. All the servers that supported the event were top notch and the manger Jesse is first class. With majority of quest traveling to attend (btw nothing but positive feedback from guest), my son and daughter planning this event from another state, not to mention how import this day was, I would not hesitate to hold another event there or recommend it to anyone who wants a place that understands how to build customer loyalty. I look forward to just stopping in for dinner next time I'm in town. Nice job Maggiano's I truly appreciate all you did!"}
{"text":"The linguine di mare I ordered for takeout was missing it's lobster"}
{"text":"Reservation at 630. Seated at 655.  Not sure why they take reservations.  We were told twice our table was getting cleared out.  I watched a heated gentlemen discuss a similar situation with the hostess.  25 minutes isn't a big deal other than when you have a babysitter and plans to get back to the kids.  

Food is great and the order pasta and take a pasta home is great.  4 cheese ravioli is wonderful."}
{"text":"I had the greatest service from Krystle recently.  She's definitely the reason I'll come back in the future , I had the lobster pasta which I recommend every body try and they make the best Negroni's I've had in a long time. Please come in and enjoy some goid service and even better food!!!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at Maggiano's in Richmond a year ago, so I was excited to see if the Maggiano's here was just as good.  It was.  We came here while we were house-hunting last winter, and not only had a great meal with a bottle of wine, but also got some great neighborhood tips from the table next to us (the official moment I started loving Charlotte).  I don't remember what we got, so I'll focus on a more recent visit.  Actually, 2 recent visits.

My job had a speaker come, and they rented the upstairs room and had appetizers and wine.  I haven't had a wine here I haven't liked (and there are several out there), and the appetizers were all good.  Following the presentation, we went downstairs and split a Ravioli and each had another glass of wine.  The ravioli were very good--and it was plenty of food to split.

If you have similar taste as your dining companion, there are a lot of dishes you could split, but I also look forward to the leftovers the next day.  The portions are generous.  Some of the dishes get a little salty, but otherwise, they are seasoned well.  It is definitely a straight-up Italian restaurant.  Some of my go-tos are Lasagne, Chicken Pesto Linguine, and the Eggplant Parm.  Oh, and the Manicotti is delicious as well. 

Dinner can run you around $50 a person with drinks, but I found the atmosphere to be nice for dinner.  I also appreciate that I never feel rushed by the staff, even when they are busy."}
{"text":"When it comes to italian this place is my favorite in Vegas ! Great place to take a date or your whole family, please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there. Lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.

Right from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! 
Some of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% Sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! 
As for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! My favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it! The chicken parm is fantastic as well! In all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!
Now for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! 

I strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize! Also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class ! 5 stars and truley a gem! 
Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Our server was absolutely incredible! He was very attentive to our needs and kept an amazing conversation with us. The food was delicious as well. I had the ravioli  and my husband had the chicken Marsala! We will definitely be returning!  I love their bread too!!!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is one of several restaurants in the fashion show mall. Definitely better than venturing into the food court if you have the time. 

Went here on a Saturday evening they were busy still, my waitress was prompt and courteous. The outdoor patio is wonderful option. The food is yummy with great menu options."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time on a Sunday around 3. The place was pretty busy but we got a table pretty quickly. My husband had the lasagna and I had a chicken dish. Mine was okay....but my husband raved about his. He is pretty picky about his food so it was a true compliment for him to enjoy it like he did. Overall I was pleased.....will diffinently return in the future."}
{"text":"Big pasta portions and tasty! Come hungry! Server was overly friendly but I like it. Better that than the other way around. Good spot at the north end of the strip right across the Wynn. Mellow romantic ambience but try to sit on the opposite side where the washrooms are that area stank like bleach & Clorox cleaners.

Easily book with Open Table."}
{"text":"We come to Maggianos every time we visit Vegas. The zucchini as an appetizer is a must!  The lunch specials are great as well!"}
{"text":"The food at Maggianos is absolutely superb. Knowing that Las Vegas has a rep for the ultra high end, Maggianos was the best I had.

The profiterole rolls were absolutely divine and the setting a little reminiscent of pastis in New York."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! I recommend the homemade Lasagna. I would definently go again :), what got me disappointed a little was the server she was slow."}
{"text":"We have visited this Maggiano's many times over the year and still enjoy dining here during our trips to Vegas. Food is always spot on and delicious. Portions are great and reasonable prices. We always get mozzarella Mariana (amazing), split a chicken Parmesan (awesome) and finish with an apple crostata (best chain restaurant dessert I have ever found). Maggiano's is a nice break from the super expensive hotel restaurants found on the strip. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"We made our reservation on Open Table and walked over from the Trump.  We were seated right away.  The service was very good.  While we were walking to our seats we noticed the portions were very generous.  My wife and I split a salad an a meal and it was more than enough.  Some might think it was cheesy but, my wife and I thought the strollling guitar player was a nice Vegas touch."}
{"text":"Just had a delightful evening and meal at Maggiano's!  The chopped salad was very good and our entrees were very good as well. Loved the atmosphere! We each had a glass of wine and it was kind of pricey for just the house cab. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Took my dad here for his 75th birthday and he had the best filet mignon he has ever had
 I don't remember our server's name but she was short gal with dark brown hair who served us out on the patio. She was exceptionally attentive but not overly so and did a wonderful job taking care of us. Very good service and very good food!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We were able to get a seat quickly. 

Bread service was my favorite part. Balsamic vinegar in Olive oil to dip the bread. Yummy!!!  

I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband had chicken Parmesan. Huge portions that we had wrapped up for later. Our daughter inhaled her ravioli. Included in her kid's meal was ice cream. Instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it. Loved that!!!!!! 

Price was decent. Food was terrific. Service was fabulous. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here today (22nd Aug) whilst in Vegas, we haven't left Vegas yet and I felt I needed to write a review.

Everything from start to finish was horrible. I ordered the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was tough, over cooked and tasteless. It came with a side of spaghetti marinara. The spaghetti was over cooked, mushy and the whole thing was very plain.
Needless to say I didn't even eat half of my meal.

My friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish (I cannot remember the name) and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood, the pasta was mushy also and tasteless. 

I asked for bottled water, they brought me tap water which I thought ok cool nevermind... I don't know what they did to the tap water there but (maybe it was the ice cubes they used?) but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic! 

Our server never checked on us once, because if so I would have told her I disliked my meal and also ordered another drink. We had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque, it was 25 minutes before our plates were cleared.

Needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great place for yummy comfort Italian food. Did family style with a large group and the portions were bottomless!

Appetizers: spinach-artichoke dip was my favorite, Italian salad and bruschetta were good

Entrees: baked ziti and chicken Parmesan were my faves, four-cheese ravioli was also good, not too keen on the potato gnocchi though.

Dessert: tiramisu was pretty good, and the spumoni ice cream was tasty!

Had very attentive service. Enjoyed the meal overall!"}
{"text":"Good riddance. 

Your food was overpriced, overhyped and unremarkable.

And your service was the absolute worse!!!"}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to restaurants because I'm from Europe and European restaurants have much nicer ambients but I really liked it at Maggianos. Food was very good. I even had a little special request and they did it for me. Our server hit the mark with our drinks, and dessert was delicious. Good job little Italy."}
{"text":"Horrible service waited about 10 minutes to get attended then we ordered and it took forever finally when the food got there they forgot the chicken on the pasta and waited about another 10 minutes till they brought it and by that time the pasta was cold and not once did we get a refill on our drinks we had to ask a server that wasn't ours to please refill our drinks he was very nice and attended us quickly then took forever to get her attention and ask for the check worse service ever"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  Have been there on numerous occasions and the food is always consistently great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is my favorite Italian restaurant in the Scottsdale area. To get the most for your money, order one of the classic pastas. Not only is it big enough to feed two, they give you another pasta to take home!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ambiance. Feels like you're in a small place in Italy. I always get the Classic Mamas Lasagna. Of course extra Parmesan cheese. I also tried the stuffed mushrooms. Can't say I thoroughly enjoyed but my taste isn't everybody's taste. But I like the place. And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Five Stars Maggianos. I know I know a corporate place but when can I say? Their food is to sleep for and the Cappuccino to wake you back up and finish it with some house Spumoni? Dang I was in heaven......Not to mention my first date with my now beautiful wife. Maggianos what can I say you lucky little place. Ill always have you in my heart and my belly............"}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's South Park for dinner yesterday w/husband & 2 kids.  Had never been to this particular site, but had been to  few Maggiano's in Southern California before.  
My experience yesterday was less than \"meh\"!  First of all, we walk in & it was freezing in the restaurant, like really unpleasantly freezing!  
My husband & I both ordered the Italian side salad to start-  a lot of white lettuce, 4 thick red onion slices, and 2 tiny olives.....really!  Disappointed!
I also ordered the Italian sausage& pasta soup ( to warm me up b/c it was still freezing cold inside).  The pasta was still hard , and had no flavor- no hint of a veggie anywhere either!  Disappointment #2.
My husband ordered the Salmon Salad, and kept finding little \"hard things\" - not bones- but something else , in his salad.   (Later on, when we got home, about 45 mins after eating, my husband got violently ill - my daughter also said her tummy felt bad too!). Disappointment #3.

My son ordered a kids pepperoni pizza -  what he was served was a flatbread with sauce, a few pepperoni, and a ton of parmesan cheese on top-  that's not a Kid's Pepperoni Pizza!  Needless to say, my son refused to eat it, or have anything else!

My daughter had the kids spaghetti & giant meatball.  she loves pasta, but hated this-  she said the meatball \"tasted funny\", and wouldn't take another bite.  I tried the meatball, and it did taste \"off\"- like it was not fresh, or made with something odd...can't really describe it, just wasn't a meatball like you'd expect.   Her pasta okay, though.

Overall, I would Not recommend this restaurant.  I was really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Started dining here two years ago and come back at least twice each trip.  We always ask for Vanessa because she's an awesome server with a great personality.  The chef Eric Anderson even came out to see how we liked the food. Great food, great prices,  great service.  Love ya, Vanessa.  See you next year!"}
{"text":"For finer dining in Las Vegas, my wife and I typically like going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris, which is excellent. Of course, we can't possibly eat there all the time, so during our last Las Vegas trip we also tried Maggiano's Little Italy. I understand this is a national chain (one which I wasn't aware of at all up until now), but if you didn't know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, but not pretentious. Service was rapid and very personable. Like many Italian restaurants, especially on the strip in Vegas, this place is fairly expensive, but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu. Our bill with tip was under $35, which is very reasonable for the large portions we received, as well as the quality of food and service we experienced. We experienced no real negatives, and the view outside of the Vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular. They also have outdoor seating, though it is limited in the number of available tables. One minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch, but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in Vegas, not limited solely to this restaurant. We've experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in Vegas. They also did not serve butter with there bread, but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it. Their to-go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum. Portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home. My daughter ended up eating that, and she was very impressed - even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave, instead of more properly in an oven. For the price, this is a well located and enjoyable Italian restaurant. It is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced (for Arab sheiks?) Italian restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time for Sunday Brunch. We were totally impressed with everyone and the food was amazing! The chef came out and talked with us! Service was excellent! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"We used to love Maggiano's so much, but our latest experience here was unbelievably disappointing! I have never had such horrible service as I had here the other night. We were originally told that our wait would be about 30 minutes, so we decided to wait in the bar. The server in the bar never did acknowledge us, so we ended up going to the bar ourselves to get drinks. Our table was finally ready an hour and 15 minutes later, and only after we asked twice. It took our server 15 minutes to even come by our table. Our appetizers took a ridiculously long amount of time to arrive and were cold when we finally did get them. One member of our party was served the wrong meal, after waiting 40 minutes for our food to come out. She was told that they would bring her the correct meal, but was offered no apology. Her food finally came out long after we were finished. My husband asked to speak to a manager and the only thing that the incompetent manager did was make excuses, never once took responsibility for our horrible experience here. I was so embarrassed that we brought our out of town guests here. The only reason I am giving Maggiano's two stars is because the food is still exceptionally good. We won't ever go back there though."}
{"text":"Took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out Maggiano's.  The ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip. Bread is brought to the table with butter, but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that. We started with an appetizer of tomato caprese that was very good, next we shared the smaller version of the spinach salad that was amazing (bacon, pine nuts, super yummy dressing etc), and finally we split a plate of the chicken parmesan that was a large portion, so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box. In total, those 3 dishes 1 water and 1 coke was $37 which I thought was very reasonable. The sever was friendly, prompt and attentive. There was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like. Overall I liked the mood of the restaurant, the romantic feel, delicious food and wonderful service. No complaints."}
{"text":"Great food & great service. Went for dinner with a party of 12 & orders off of the family style menu. Plenty of food. Great for bigger groups like our's."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I have celiac disease, so I'm usually hesitant about eating out for fear of being \"glutened\". Upon arriving, I was greeted by a hostess who explained what items were gluten free. I was then greeted by the chef who assured me how careful they are about cross contamination. The food was excellent, the service was superb, and the assurance that I wouldn't get sick was so nice. Definitely a great place for anyone following a gluten free diet."}
{"text":"I honestly hated this place. The shrimp Scampi was a waste of money. Also the lite fetachini(sorry it's spelt wrong) Sauce was really bad. The only good thing about it was the bread in the beginning!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time here tonight! We had our Christmas party and the food was delicious! I especially loved the Apple Crumb with ice cream. It was so good it was sinful!"}
{"text":"OK. I am not  a connoisseur of  Italian eateries, but I have been to enough  Italian restaurants in my time to give a solid review. First, my friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday evening 3 days in advance. We get to the restaurant at 6:55pm and the hostess gave  us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes. Half an hour later, we still have not been seated yet. I wonder why we  even bothered to make reservations. In my book, you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes,  you get seated. that is the point of making a RESERVATION and the basic meaning of the word. This is a big NO NO in my book. That is either poor planning or mismanagement or both. If I am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant, I expect to be taken care of. that is what I am paying for and have no problem doing so.  The silver lining ,if there is one, is that we weren't the only ones. there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager. Not a good sign. the waitress was nice enough and adequate though. the only issue I had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread, but guess what, no bread. only after 20 minutes and asking did we receive our bread. again, not what I expect from a  purported higher class establishment. the food was adequate but not what I would call earth shattering. the calamari was tasty and the Rigatoni D was tasty and sauce was good. I have had better and worse.  my friends all liked what they got from what they told me. Overall, mediocre experience at best.One thing I have learned over the years is that  you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and I must say that was horrible and maybe the worst I have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days. It  was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels, water, all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy. again, I hope they don't keep the kitchen like the do the restroom. I don't even want to think about that.  Overall, not a horrible experience but not one for the books either. In my opinion, Carrabas easily matches and super cedes Maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price. Oh,  Almost forgot, I will give a 4 or 5 on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant.  It was a comfortable and luxurious setting, and decorated nicely but unfortunately, the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside."}
{"text":"If you'd like a light lunch - don't come here - one serve of a main pasta dish will feed a family of 4 for a month!!

Serving sizes aside, the food is pretty good; heaps of flavour, fresh herbs and all that good stuff.

Try the specialty flatbreads - kinda like a small pizza with some superb combinations on top (we had the margharita (sp) with tiny tomatoes, basil and the addition of spicy sausage.

There are plenty of wines by the glass including an Oz wine or 2.

Nice place overlooking the strip, and being right down one end it doesn't seem to be as over-subscribed as some."}
{"text":"Even with a reservation we stood for 20 minutes for our table.

Our server was a nice guy, but was completely overwhelmed. We felt bad for him and didn't lean on him much, and decided to just roll with the punches in an effort to salvage our meal and experience. We never were asked for our drink order, and when we asked if we could place one were told just a minute (which never came).

We'll stick to the original strip location, as it has a nicer buildout and ambiance and service to go with it."}
{"text":"I could definitely do without the creepy guy walking around playing the accordian, but I'll put up with it for the really yummy food and fun ambiance!

We have eaten here several times and ordered pretty much everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed.  Some things are better than others, of course (try the chicken and spinach manicotti -- MMMMmm), but overall the quality has always been good, the service fast, and if you can get a window seat, the view is great for people-watching!

Oh and it sounds really plain and boring, but trust me... try the pound cake for dessert.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Its great place to dine. Classy with affordable prices. The food s wonderful. Will always recommend to everybody to experience the best Italian fine or casual dining."}
{"text":"Went here last week with friends and was very unimpressed overall.  When we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all but were told that the wait would be 45 minutes-1 hour.  This was after waiting for at least 5 minutes, standing right in front of the desk, with no one in front of me and the 2 people at the desk didn't even acknowledge that I was there!  We decided to sit in the bar area so we could eat sooner.

We were worried that with the small number of servers there our service would be slow.  But the service from our waitress was actually the best part of our experience there.  We were able to order relatively quickly (I didn't expect superfast service sitting in the bar) but our food arrived and one order was wrong while another was missing a crucial ingredient.  Our waitress immediately apologized and worked to get it fixed.  She blamed the errors on the kitchen - I have no idea what was the cause but it didn't really matter.  In the end one of our party was unable to get her order fixed and ended up boxing it to take home...after waiting over 30 minutes to get the missing ingredient.

Our waitress took that order off the bill which was very generous (and naturally resulted in a very generous tip).  But we were disappointed with the number of errors with our food and slowness in having them fixed by the kitchen.  If the kitchen staff were having a \"bad day\" the management should have been fixing it.  I live here in Las Vegas and normally go to Maggiano's almost every time I go to Fashion Show, but after this experience I have no plans to eat here again.  Hopefully the management will see this review and get their stuff together!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF RESPECT.  The staff is pathetic....you have to ask for service......beg for things like silverware.....they serve bread with no bread plates or napkin.....they are clueless at this restaurant(?)....the manger is even worse.....he has no idea how to train the staff or run a dinner service.......when I complained to the Manager about the horrible experience I was having the table next to me began applauding because they were having the same experience......enough said!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving, ruined !
Dont' ever, EVER, think about going here for Thanksgiving!  First of all, the food was terrible. Over salted. Just awful.  Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation!
Ridiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!)
For seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.  Two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner.   They have a lot of nerve charging $40 per person!"}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes before closing time.  The service was excellent, the food was excellent, and we were not rushed through our meal because the restaurant was closing.  Another great dining experience at Maggiano's."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and showed up on time but they made us wait for half an hour. And then it took another 15 minutes to get us a drink. And they packed the wrong food for take home order. It was my first visit to Maggiano's and I don't think I will come back here again. Total disappointment for the hyped reputation."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our reception here. The staff was incredible and so on top of things. Everyone had nothing but great things to say. The food was great as well. I cannot recommend having an event at Maggiano's."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner. I wasn't in the Christmas spirit and Stephanie changed that. Hands down best service I've ever had. That says a lot. I've traveled, I've been in the industry for 15+ years. As a female in male dominated establishments. You made my day! Stephanie! Great food, warm, informative, service. I watched the floor great teamwork both back and front. I grew up in Chicago going here and this is the best one I've been to."}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is AWESOME! Prices are not bad and portions are absolutely HUGE. My boyfriend and I stopped in before a Bobcats game and we were incredibly impressed. He got the lasagna which was absolutely heavenly, and my spaghetti was delicious as well! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be coming back for sure! Eryka our bartender / server was phenomenal very punctual, personable, and knowledgeable about the restaurant and food. It was a pleasure to dine their and have her as our server. The coupon was totally worth it. Their appetizer Caprice was phenomenal with the cheese and the fresh tomatoes all of our meals were very tasty and came out hot the banana cheesecake was the perfect ending with a cup of coffee. Highly recommend to try this restaurant out you will not regret it make sure though you ask for Eryka"}
{"text":"OK, I didn't realize this was a chain.  My first five minute observations: no towels in bathroom.  Cosmo ordered one of the worst ever, but with some lime juice somewhat palatable.  Very, very nice staff all around who wanted to make my experience a good one and jumped to correct both.  The waiter even tossed in a New York accent and said he could pull strings, to which the busser laughed and called him out.  Very funny.    Love that effort and I upped the score one star for it  ;-)  Sat on the deck downstream of a tour bus.  You will be in a mall parking lot here, so keep your expectation reasonable I guess!"}
{"text":"Standard maggianos fare, which is always a good meal for the $. Service and drinks seemed sharper in Vegas than Atlanta where I usually go."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location twice...once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both times the service and food have been excellent!  I would drive across town for their spinach salad.  It is awesome.

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Food was good, got the meal for two where you take two pastas home.  Food took an hour to get to us then upon leaving we wanted to take home the lasagna and fetuccine Alfredo which we have our order to  our waiter  when we made The initial order.  The lasagna was two dollars more.  No biggie.  When we cashed out we had to ask for our pastas.  Once we left and got home to Ahwatukee, we opened our box and there was literally four raviolis in the one box.  Of we are going to pay more and not even get one full pasta dish, I think that's ridiculous!  Very disappointed as I took my friend here who flew in from Florida.  Driving all the way to North Scottsdale and not getting what we paid for.."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and each time I have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer. The food here is fantastic - I highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer. Also, you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli. If you come to the restaurant with a large group, they have a great family style option. However, this option is ONLY AVAILABLE for groups of four or over. Do not waste your calories/money if your group is smaller than this - it is not worth it, and you will have to take food home."}
{"text":"Our family of 7 celebrated Mom's birthday there last Saturday.  Understaffing made service terrible.  We got our meals at different times. The last one of us got dinner after all the rest of us were finished. All the manager did was say ,sorry. The food quality was just Ok. The experience unfortunate. We won't be back."}
{"text":"average of 4 stars WHY!!!! we were sat down by some fat little waiter who looked pissed off that he had to work for a living (sorry dude but you suck). he placed oil and balsamic into a dish but seemed to give 3 tables out of the seven around him bread (thank god he didnt do the feeding of the 5000, 3574 of them would have died of starvation)
 i ordered one of the 'specials' chicken and mushroom lasagne. my experience of a lasagne is that it should be roasting hot straight out of the oven with the cheese bubbling proper italian food. this was slightly warm at best and definately cooked previously frozen and reheated in a microwave POOR! so in all food crap and service even crapper."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  When seated, they even told us Happy Anniversary! 

Even though the place is quite large it was very easy to have a wonderful, intimate dinner together.  Our server, Leslie, was amazing.  Very attentive.  

The food was very good!  It's been a long time since we have had really good Italian food.  The portion sizes are very large, but so good.  The zuchini Fritte was delicious!  Perfectly paired with the lemon aioli dipping sauce. We ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu which they brought out with two pink candles bent in the shape of a heart and with one lighted candle!  It was a wonderful touch!  They brought out a plate of lemon cookies that were so light and delicious.

We were so pleased with our experience here.  From the outstanding service to the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Food was good but no better than olive garden or other comparable places yet Maggiano's is pricier.  I expected more. Portions were tiny.   If you want more for your money walk 20 feet to the cheesecake factory next door."}
{"text":"We loved it! Great food, great atmosphere! Everything tasted great if you didn't know that's it was a chain restaurant you would never guess it is. Maggiano's is defiantly my wife and I's new go to Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Our waiter had do many great suggestions that we took him up on and were greatly pleased. The Lucas Martin wine was so smooth."}
{"text":"For over six years now, whenever my wife and I go to Vegas, this place has been a favorite. I love the gnocchi and Italian sausage, but haven't had anything I didn't like. 

Picture this: last night; Monday night; in Vegas again on business; four of us looking for a good meal; walk up to the counter and they are telling everyone it's an hour and a half wait; good thing I had a reservation. We were seated in minutes, 8:06 to be exact. Not bad for an 8:00 reservation. 

It was all good, as always. The service and especially the food!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

We ate here mid-week at 7:30. Arrived and were told it's a 20-30-minute wait. We said we called to make reservations, but they told us that they didn't take them until 8:30, AND said there would be no wait. Girl at the front desk said oh, we take reservations 90 minutes or more out. Oh okay, please tell us that next time.

We were seated about 30 minutes later, outside (yay!). Our waiter appeared quickly and we ordered beverages. Sadly, none of our drinks - water, coke, or beer - were ever refilled. Nobody even noticed that my husband was out of both water and coke and that I gave him my water to tide him over. Not that we could have notified our waiter; most of the time, he was not to be found.

We ordered shrimp linguine and angel hair with tomato sauce. The half orders, contrary to what we've heard, barely fed 2 adults, and we're not gluttonous eaters. Angel hair was decent, but nothing to write home about. Skip the side salad - it was iceberg lettuce, whole grape tomatoes, and dry croutons. You can either have italian dressing or blue cheese. Apparently, those are your choices.

Our server was very polite, but he was very rushed; it was hard to get him to linger at the table for a moment, and as I mentioned, he never noticed our empty glasses, nor offered any refills. We sat with a pile of empty plates at the end of the meal for a long time before he reappeared and asked if we wanted dessert."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was great. The food and service was just womderful. It had a great atmosphere. Will come back next time I'm in towm"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to the opening of Maggianos near our home. We frequently eat at Downtown Summerlin and were happy to welcome the well known eatery. Unfortunately it was not  what we hoped for. We ordered the Italian sausage with peppers as an appetizer, the sausage was nicely grilled on the outside but inside it was completely uncooked....I mean health department reportable raw! I also ordered beef tenderloin medallions which was very tender sadly the listed \"garlic mashed potatoes\" had no hint of garlic and was barely warm. They also brought an additional plate with two more scoops of the naked mediocre spuds. The waitress later admitted it was a mistake. My husband's Chicken Marsala was also unremarkable. Of course the sausage was removed from the check and a gentleman sporting some sort of headset stopped by with a quick apology. I would have thought that we would have been comped desert or a a token discount but nothing was offered and we did not ask. When the newness wears off they will be wanting the repeat business like ours.....not likely to happen."}
{"text":"We ate here on NYE and the service from Nestor was the best. The location overlooking the Strip was great and the interior dark wood style was very nice  I recommend the Salmon and the Pork Medallions."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Best Italian food in Vegas and the service was excellent. Fred looked after us from the moment we walked in and he was brilliant!"}
{"text":"Yes, Maggiano's is a chain, and yes it's a big-box Italian restaurant in a town with quite a few mom-and-pop Italian joints--but my-oh-my can they cook some great Italian food!  Being based out of Chicago certainly doesn't hurt.

Little lady and I had a great family style dinner here when my folks were in town, and absolutely everything was fantastic.  I'm pretty sure I came within a couple bites eating myself to death (think Monty Python's The Meaning of Life).

For weekend dining, I highly recommend reservations and request a booth which will put you above and away from the main floor (I do feel they pack a few too many tables in the available space).  This made the meal all the more enjoyable.

Make sure to leave a day open for digestion!"}
{"text":"Although they have a very nice special going on - buy a classic pasta and you receive an additional one to take home, the spaghetti with marinara was awful and not worth taking home.  It was just this tomato sauce, no garlic, no seasoning. Our waiter, Ryan, was spot on and very attentive.  But shortly after our salads arrived, another waitperson brought our pasta.  We wanted to have them take it back and keep it warm but she moved plates over and dropped the pasta and left.  So, until they start adding some flavor to the sauces, this is not even an average Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Fun atmosphere.  Great for large groups.

Whoever is the marketing genius that decided \"let's give away a free entree with purchase\" at Maggiano's is genius.  Not only do you get to enjoy one of their delicious Classic Pastas (which in and of itself is big enough for two meals) but you also get to take one home for tomorrow night's dinner.  It doesn't need to be the same thing you originally ordered, which allows you to broaden your dining experience.  When I was there recently, I had the four-cheese ravioli and the eggplant parmigiana.  Both were superb.  The eggplant tasted like it came out of my grandma's kitchen, and that's saying a lot.

As far as chain restaurants go, Maggiano's is one of the best in my opinion. In the ranking system of Italian joints, Maggiano's is right up there when it comes to quality, quantity and service.  And that's coming from a real Paisan."}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Open Table for 7:45. We arrived and were told that it would be approximately 15 minutes. I could tell they were busy so we said no big deal. Then at 8pm we were told another 20 minutes. It took a total of 25 min after our reservation in which to be seated. I wasn't so impressed with their attitude either. 

Our service was great once we were sat though.  Seidi our waitress was great. She made some recommendations and my husband and I were both completely satisfied. I had the chicken piccata and he had the parmesean. She recommended the lite on each and the hand made pasta was to die for. Definitely changed my pasta opinion as this was my first hand made pasta. Wonderful. 

Although I wasn't too impressed with the snotty hostess team, the rest of the staff changed my opinion as well as the meal itself. I feel bad only giving a 4 stars due to the first impression."}
{"text":"Excellent for a chain. Food was really good, service amazing and the balsamic glaze drizzled over the tomato caprese appetizer was excellent!  Beautiful, clean and very busy. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not the best place to go if you're trying to eat healthy haha BUT when it's a friends birthday and u kind of have to go the restaurant does offer \"lighter fare\" options and glutten free options. My gripe was not being provided with correct nutritional information, I feel like I annoyed the guy when I asked. And my food was good just tasted kind of salty. Ehhh. I'll try it again tho someday."}
{"text":"4 for being one of the better chain restaurants.  Decent italian, good sauce, excellent service, nice decor, mid priced.
This is a nice place if you have a large family gathering, office party, gathering of friends.  it's a large space, not cramped and the menu is extensive enough so everyone can find something they like.
The draw here is the food combined with being able to be interactive with your party...it's not a quiet candle lit type of place.  Kids can be kids since this is a family friendly chain.  You might not be wowed by having the best Italian but you will say you had a good meal and had a good time.

Parking is convenient with spaces surrounding the 'mall'....though it can be busy Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Sat at bar. They weren't even busy. Waited 20 mins to order. They didn't even wipe the bar or remove previous customers drinks. After 50 min wait, they asked what we ordered; they didn't even put our order in. We got up and left. Absolutely horrible service. Completely unacceptable for Vegas service. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian places. The server was nice, the food came out quick"}
{"text":"The service was more than expected everyone was fantastic the food was great very filling the location was beautiful the restaurant was very nice our server Paolo was so helpful and friendly we even had a guitarist serenade us it was the best experience I will make it a point to go every time I'm  in town"}
{"text":"Service was great.  

Atmosphere was great.  

Side Caesar Salad and bread were great.  

My side (rigatoni and sauce) was good.  

Main course, chicken parm looked great, but the chicken tasted and had the texture of something that came frozen and in a bag.  Was disappointing!!!

My fiancé loved her chicken piccata."}
{"text":"We dine here about twice per month.  The service, atmosphere, drinks and food is and have always been of the highest quality.  However, if they mess up, they will fix it right away."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! !!!
Best meal of our trip !
Eric was our waiter and his service was wonderful. 
Love the \"from scratch\" kitchen !
We got the rigatoni, lasagna, lobster pasta, and steak special. 
Best part... it was one of our less expensive dining experiences !!
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.

We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.

We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. 

I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, we decided to book my sister's wedding cocktail reception at Maggiano's in Vegas. It was one of the best decisions we made!!

Working with Beth, Assistant Banquet Sales Manager was awesome. We emailed back and forth prior to our October 13th reception. She was easy to get a hold of and very helpful. 

We had 25 people attend the reception. They put us in the DiCarlo private room. We decided to go with the 2 hour reception, all you can drink/ appetizer food menu. You can't beat the price!! Beth asked how would we like the room sit up. I told her that majority of the people will be standing around socializing but I wanted the options for guests to sit! We had 3 high tables and 2 low tables for people to sit. Worked out perfect!!

We arrived a little early. So we made our way to the bar, which was large! When the married couple arrived, they felt special that their name was on the board when they came in. When you walk into Maggiano's it is very elegant. 

The 2 severs for our party, I forgot their names but they were excellent!!! The drinks were flowing and the food was coming out!! Our guests are drinkers and probably were very needy... I never felt the servers were annoyed! They were in a good mood and accommodated us!! They were very nice too!!

The food was amazing, no one complained!! THANK YOU CHEFS!!

Maggiano's allowed us to have a dock station to play our own music! 

Since no one was in the other private room we were able to go on the balcony to make toast and and take pictures! The balcony is awesome! I actually wish the party was out there!

The manager stopped by at the end of the night to see how everything went! We couldn't have thanked him more for an unforgettable wedding reception! Our friends and family are still talking about how they enjoyed the wedding reception!

I especially recommend Maggiano's in Vegas for a wedding reception! I can't wait to come back and get dinner here! !"}
{"text":"Fancy atmosphere distracts you from the overpriced wine list and mediocre food. 

The Good: Chicken Romano was perfectly moist and came out piping hot. Their homemade hot sauce was the best thing I had there.

The Bad: I was very offended by mass market wines (e.g. Apothic, Cline Zinfindel) that sell for $10 a bottle at the supermarket that are offered here for $10-14 a glass. The entree-sized Maggiano's salad was a mound of soggy iceberg lettuce for $15. They ran out of crispy prosciutto - 1 of only 4 ingredients in the salad - without deducting any of the cost. My eggplant parmesan was completely mushy and lukewarm.

The Verdict: Good place for a date if you care more for the atmosphere than the food, and you care nothing about wine. If you are more discerning and have $100 to spend for 2 people, there are plenty of better places to go where you'd get decent wine and real quality food."}
{"text":"Horrible. The rudest staff and establishment I have ever dealt with. I booked my reservation a few days ahead of time for 7:45 pm. Due to Las Vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game I attended, our party arrived at approximately 7:55. I checked in to the front desk and said hello. To which I was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name. I provide the name and am told that due to my lateness, keep in mind I am 10 minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant, they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site. At this point I am already annoyed, but I am on vacation and starving so I state the reason for my 10 minutes of tardiness. I continue and ask if we  can get another table. The \"greeter\" says I will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour  wait . I am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait. A minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area. We move over to the corner by a coat rack. Another minute passes, the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also. With my patience drawing low, I move over again to another open spot in the corner. After a couple minutes the supervisor AGAIN states to move away from this new spot. Not once does he show us another place to stand, nor does he say please or  thank you or anything but move. Rather, he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant. Finally, we have had enough and call the manager . A \"manager type\" scaddadles over after about 15 minutes and says whats wrong. We tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time. Also so, he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant. We left. Ridiculous service by a faux Italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about Italian culture, gratitude or hosting. They are obviously solely interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible. You are not a customer to them, you are another number to stuff with chef boyardee noodles at $20 a pop."}
{"text":"We went here for our Valentine's dinner last night and man was it busy. This is a very popular strip restaurant for good reason. The servers struggled a little because of the volume of customers but held up pretty well all things considered. I had the veal Marsala which was some of the best I've had and the wife had a chicken and potatoes dish that was equally tasty. This was a very nice meal even as busy as it was. Good job guys on a challenging night for restaurants."}
{"text":"Our server was really good. This was our first time eating at Maggiano's celebrating a friends birthday. The food was amazing! Their Italian food is legit, not your olive garden style variety. The portions are huge, ordering family style was the way to go. Bring an appetite, you're going to need it."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was as well.  Not outstanding or remarkable,  but what you come to expect from this chain. You always know the food and service are good no matter what location."}
{"text":"Maggianos in multiple cities has long been a family favorite. I just couldn't understand the negative reviews here....until we went to this location last night. My how far it's fallen. We watched every table around us have some significant issues: one table got their main course but never received their salads. They had to tell their waiter, he never noticed. Another table had to send one person's meal back, and it took so long to get the replacement they just said forget it, everyone else was long finished and they had kids in the party. Our service was ok, but my son's cheese raviolis were cold.....ice cold. And the marinara tasted like tomato sauce out of a can. We've been to Maggiano's so many times in 15 years that I'm quite sure either something is done differently at this location, or corporate has changed the food. My Rigatoni D was ok but not the great taste from previous....bland. It took the waiter so long to check on us that my son just ate his dinner, he was hungry and we'd started late. I can't believe I'm saying this, but not going back. May re try one in Chevy Chase, Denver, or Chicago to determine if Scottsdale is just an anomaly. Note the place was packed. Even at 830, long lines. You can do better for basic Italian classics."}
{"text":"I don't usually like chain restaurants, but I am staying in the Beachwood area for work and chain restaurants were my only option for dinner. 

Maggiano's was pleasant, considering it is tucked into a shopping mall. Once you step in, you forget that it's attached to a Dillard's. 

Because I was by myself, I sat at the bar. My bartender was friendly but not annoying. My food came quickly and was hot and delicious. I love that they give you a second portion of the classic pastas to take home - although I'm not sure my waistline will agree. 

The wine list is mediocre and overpriced, but maybe I'm being a bit harsh. It's not bad for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I've enjoyed authentic out-of-this-world italian cuisine at a restaurant before *cough* Dolce Vita Ristorante in Boston's North End *cough*, or perhaps it's due to the fact that I have a sicilian grandmother whose pasta and gravy would make a grown man swoon...but
Maggiano's Little Italy just didn't do it for me. The food was adequate, maybe above average by Charlotte's standards, but nothing swoon-worthy. Certainly forgettable.

I did enjoy the overall design and atmosphere of the restaurant even though the servers were less than polite, and bordered on rude. 

That being said however, I wouldn't cross this off my list altogether, but instead just go there for drinks."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but waaaaaaaaaaaaay to much salt.  We got there around 730pm and were told to wait 30-40 min for a table.  They gave us a buzzer, so we went and sat next door.  After about 45 min, we went up to the counter and asked how much longer our table would be.  The hostess checked their list and looked a little flustered... as if our name magically disappeared.  She immediately seated us.  Our server was pretty good at first.  I got the \"famous\" rigatoni D, while my bf got the beef cannelloni.  Both our dishes were very very salty.  For the beef cannelloni, they were very generous with the beef, very sparse on the pasta, and the carrots were undercooked and very crunchy.  My rigatoni was a very big portion, but so salty I ended up drinking all my water for half the dish.  

This brings me to my second qualm...  once we got our dishes, our server went MIA.  It seemed like everyone around us with bigger parties had very good service, while we waited and waited for him to even acknowledge us.  We had to ask for water and even then it took 5 min to get it.  

Overall, I'd say the restaurant was overpriced (we ended up spending $45 on just those two entrees) and overhyped.  Would I eat here again?  Maybe if someone were treating... and only if I have a full glass of water!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pleasant staff, veal parmesan was chewy , and the calamari too."}
{"text":"We were there for the first time on 10/24/12.  We enjoyed our food, and service was fine.  However, we did run into a problem later.  I was not happy about how long it took to get a reply.  Tony, the manager, once aware of the situation took good care of us.  Food quality is a 4, service a 3,  problem resolution time a 3 but the general manager's resolution I'd give a 5.   I liked Tony and will probably return."}
{"text":"Was it just because I was really hungry, or was the food really that good?

My wife and I visited Las Vegas for our wedding anniversary back in January.  Upon driving in from San Diego, we went shopping, drove around a bit and by the time we checked into our hotel, we were famished.  Look out the window and what did we see?  Maggianos, never been there, it is close, let's give it a whirl.

It was crowded!!  45 minute wait?  Forget it, let's go to the bar and perfect 2 seats on the corner.

Bartender was very pleasant and even humored me when I had to share a picture on my phone that I had received earlier in the day.  \"Drinking rum before 10am makes you a pirate NOT an alcoholic\"

I can't even remember what my wife had, but I didn't care.  I do know that she liked it though.  I had the spaghetti with meatball in meat sauce.  Holy smokes.  Spaghetti is probably my goto favorite food, but this was wow!

Wait...there is no Maggiano's in San Diego?  Nooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was one if the worst restaurant experiences I have had in years, and I eat out a lot. I ate there with my family which includes my wife and I, two teenagers, and a 14 month old.  From sitting down to getting our entrees, it took literally an hour and a half (yes, i timed it).  Do not go here if you have young kids, the wait staff is obviously clueless...  If you can't or don't understand family dining, don't attach your restaurant to a mall...

The food was luke warm at best (lasagna, egg plant Parm, ravioli, and salmon) and my wife (egg plant Parm) spent the entire next day with severe \"flu like\" symptoms (both directions if you get my meaning). One of the gimmicks at this restaurant is if you order one of their traditional Italian dishes, you get a to-go serving of one of their traditional dishes to take home with you.  Do not bother!!!  Not only was the pre-packaged take home serving similar in quality to Chef Boyardee, one of the dishes was another tables boxed leftovers!!!  Really?!?!

Never again"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas restaurant scene can be overwhelming and expensive.  My family was in the mood for pasta so after much research, we decided to give Maggiano's a try.  We all had pasta and were  very happy with our meals.  I had the shrimp scampi which was excellent!  One thing we liked was the \" lighter side\" options on some of the pasta dishes, which was perfect for my wife and daughter. The service was excellent and the prices are reasonable.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered angel hair spaghetti with vegetables and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna. Both were awful! The spaghetti was tasteless with few veggies that weren't  really cooked.
The lasagna was actually cheese with a little bit of meat and tomato sauce, plus the meat quality was poor.
All this \"pleasure\" for about 14$ a dish.

Wouldn't recommend ever.

The only good thing: the waiter Stacey was very nice!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Everything we had was delicious. The spinach and artichoke dip was probably one of the best I've ever had. The ambiance was exactly what I was hoping for, cozy with dim lighting along with music to fit the theme. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Good pasta. Good desserts. Good view.

I've eaten at Maggiano's in Princeton, New Jersey and in Atlanta, Georgia. I really wanted to try Las Vegas' Maggiano's. It did not disappoint.

I ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, which was delish. The warm, italian bread dipped in seasoned olive oil was finger-licking good; not that I licked my fingers... I had three delicious dishes for the mini dessert sampler: New York style cheesecake (yummy), apple crostada (yummy), and chocolate Zuccotto cake (yummy).

The price was pretty good. 

I dined alone as my friends were napping to recover from the evening's debaucheries. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is must go and enjoy great ambiance. The service was attentive and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have had stomach cramps and diarrhea for a week after eating here, and I will never come back. I am not the kind of person who is nitpicky or needlessly complains. I have never sent food back...but this one time, I wish I had. I went here for a birthday dinner. The service was slow (3 hours to get through dinner & dessert), the water tasted funky, everybody's food was cold when it arrives and my \"seafood\" dish was literally 20 muscles on top of linguine with maybe 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce. I am glad most people have not shared such a negative experience, but for what we spent on dinner and how I feel right now, I would not recommend this place to anyone I like."}
{"text":"Hard to imagine. Great quality, awesome service, reasonable prices, in LAS VEGAS at a chain? Yes! Maggiano's. I don't know what else I can say. The ambiance was country club. Menu selection was Superb.

OK it wasn't a quiet little bistro. it's located on LV Blvd. In Fashion Show shopping center. But the food is good and you can easily splurge on the wine or drinks, and still save a ton over the big name places, eg. Batali's B&B, etc."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation over a month in advance to celebrate a very special event in our family.  Reservation was for 10 at 6:00pm.  9 of us travelled from Illinois for this event.  As I am a Maggiano's fan of our local one in Vernon Hills, Illinois I felt confident that this was the place for our celebration.   There was a rainstorm which would delay our arrival so I phoned the restaurant to inform them we would be late (12 minutes). The woman on the phone said \"ok, no problem\". One of our party did arrive at 6:00 and was told that there was no reservation and that for a party of our size it would be a 2-1/2 hour wait!!!  This party member said there must be a mistake that there was a reservation. The manager promptly walked him outside so there would not be a scene!  Are you serious?? Since I was the person who made the reservation and had the confirmation I approached the manager who was standing outiside with my guest! I explained that we had called and he said they received no such call which was a lie!  I showed him my reservation confirmation.  He was rude not only to me but my guests.  They ultimately did seat us but this restaurant has serious issues which starts with their manager!  Food was mediocre at best!  Nothing like our local Maggianos.  Good riddance if this location is closing!!!"}

{"text":"We went to South Park Mall in Charlotte nc. The place was busy. We ordered the appetizer and the 4 classic pastas. Surprisingly, we were not asked if we would like to take home same pastas or different variety. Then we waited for 20 mins for the dinner to get served and my little one was hungry. When I asked if I could just get the kids meal first since she was hungry, server said he would have to get them all together but he will check. Really, if a kid is hungry and we ordered 20 mins back , how long do we still have to wait???? We never got the lemon cookies that came with the kids meal when we were told we would get it at the end. It was my husband's birthday but we did not even mention about it.we ordered the pastas with chicken in it, however, there was no chicken in take home pastas.. There was another big group and seems that they were all busy serving them. We were just a party of 6 so a small business to them I assume.

WILL NOT RETURN!"}

Our private room was beautiful and the staff was 100% there for us during both the planning stages and the event itself. Our guests raved about the food and were even happier to discover that the staff packed up the leftovers for us to take back to our suite (enough to feed everyone lunch the next day). A terrific experience from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"I held my wedding reception at Maggiano's.

Beth and Sabrina were so patient with me, and they worked with me to help plan everything. I'm from Canada and had no idea who to use for anything that I needed, so they gave me a list and I went from there.

Everything was perfect. All of my guests were well fed and happy with the event, and commented all night on how great the service and food was. 

The family style dinner isn't something anyone had seen at a wedding before, and we all thought that was great. We were a small group of 20, and we decided to have everyone seated at one long table, and that was perfect.

All in all, my wedding was perfect thanks to Beth and Sabrina and the rest of the staff at Maggiano's, and I couldn't be more thankful."}
{"text":"Been a long time fan of Maggianos. What happened?? Food quality has gone down hill maybe it was this Summerlin location? Have been to the fashion show and LA locations and always been wonderful. Ordered calamari (my favorite) and portion size was half of what I usually get at other locations plus the calamari pieces were so tiny. Spinach and artichoke al forno was yummy but again small portion. Out of the risotto pepperoni bites, disappointing. Entrees: chicken parm was dry, meatball very \"doughy\" ? Lots of bread crumbs maybe and meat sauce for spaghetti, sweet and not a good taste. Italian sausage appetizer was generous but where were the peppers and onions and why did they looked barely done?  Very busy for a Saturday night. Took 2 1/2 hours to have dinner with no dessert . Will not be returning to this location. Too many other better restaurants in downtown Summerlin"}
{"text":"Don't even think of going here unless you make a reservation. I was just there at 7:05pm and was told the wait was 45 minutes n then an hour and then we would be seated at  8:16 n then there are 8 reservations ahead of you.  It's 8:53 n still no table so we left. 

On our way out we tried to just order out with the lady at the front desk n she was not familiar with the menu and she said she was new. 

So make sure u make reservations. Just got text at 9:03 that my table is ready"}
{"text":"First time at Maggiano's. It was excellent. We had the $42 dinner special for 2. It included table bread, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert to share and 2 additional entrees to take home. We chose the calamari for our appetizer. I had the fettuccine alfredo, husband had the rigatoni. For dessert we had the tiramisu. Everything was amazing from the food to the service! This is now one of my new favorite Italian restaurants in this area. Definitely worth driving to from our home in Lake Wylie."}
{"text":"This review is primarily for take-out. I love Maggiano's easy online ordering, especially on those nights you just don't feel like cooking! My favorite things I've tried are the Baked Ziti and the Chicken Picatta. They also have my favorite calamari fritte in the valley- it's always tender! The food may not quite meet the homemade standard, but it sure does the trick!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Italian restaurant!  A must have is Rigatoni D.  A few other recommendations are four cheese ravioli, beef medallions and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Beautiful restaurant and very busy.  Make reservations on a weekend."}
{"text":"We ate here in early April. The wait staff were very helpful and knew the menu quite well. Which is impressive because the menu is HUGE. We told our waitress it was our first visit and she was genuinely enthused to help us have good experience. The portions are Flinstone's sized, so be careful. Our order was prepared perfectly. Since we were on vacation, we could not take anything home with us, which was unfortunate - as the food was great. This location seemed a bit noisy, but this is a minor issue. We made our reservation thru open table and this worked fine. This is a great place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, I believe our servers name was David, wonderful service, very attentive, didn't miss a beat. All four meals ordered were excellent. I would definitely visit this restaurant again. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price and our waiter Ryan was Awesome! Very friendly and great service. Recommend for Italian food and drinks. A winner and ask for Ryan!"}
{"text":"I always loved the Fashion Show location so I decided to come to this location for my birthday. We got the shrimp oreganata (seasonal special), Rigatoni D and Spaghetti and Meatball. All were delicious! And our server also came out with lemon cookies with a birthday candle. The lemon cookies were so good! Luckily, I got a birthday coupon to come back and get a free order of more lemon cookies. Our server Maggie was awesome! She was very attentive and soooo lovely! Couldn't have gotten better service."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the Strip, they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after.  My table had gnocchi, chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan, and the rigatoni D and they were all extremely good.  The only word of advice is to park in Treasure Island or the Wynn/Encore.  The mall parking is far from the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception here and thought it would be special torevisit it for our 6 month anniversary since our original impression was spectacular. Unfortunately our experience for our anniversary was the complete opposite.  Even though we made reservations our table was on top of the guests behind us. The service was virtually nonexistent;  we had empty glasses, we waited about 30 minutes for each course,  and when  finally got our food it was not as satisfying as our original experience.  Needless to say, we will not be dining with them again."}
{"text":"Maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, with a good location, great food and excellent service.
If you're looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it, I come here every time I'm visiting Vegas with my four years old daughter (of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant). 
The location is perfect, specially if you're planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if you're  lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the Wynn and Encore casinos across the strip.
The food is great,  some of my favorites entrees are the Lobster Carbonara, the Rigatoni D and the Chicken Manicotti, all good and  the portion of food is more than enough.
The excellent service is based on my last visit. I made a 7:15pm reservation but we arrived about 20 minutes earlier (Vegas traffic unpredictable). I asked them if we could be  seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves. Nestor was the name of the waiter, he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers, wine and desserts. Simply GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's for the first time last Sunday, 5/27.  It was busy, but the very friendly hostess squeezed us in with a 45 min wait.  Not a problem for us, considering we had no reservation and we were waiting for the rest of our party.  Our buzzer was activated almost exactly 45 mins after we spoke with the hostess.  We were seated just about 5 minutes later at a great table facing their floor to ceiling windows which looked out toward Encore, Wynn and Palazzo.  It was a great view at 6:30pm.  

The food was excellent. Our order included garlic bread, zucchini fritte, shrimp scampi, shrimp tropheo, lemon chicken and salmon oscar.  Everyone enjoyed their a la carte entrees.  The scampi and tropheo were both such large servings that 2 people could easily share.  Then we ordered dessert, their 5 item sampler, lemon cookies($2) and profiteroles ($2).  All was soooooo delicious!!  And their 5 item sampler was only $9.95 -- but each of the samples was a portion fit for one person as a normal serving!   All of the food tasted fresh and extremely flavorful.  Service could have been a bit faster but one has to take in to account that many large parties go to this location on The Strip at Fashion Show.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  Other workers also pitched in when we asked for anything.  

Parking is a bit unconventional, especially if you dine at late evening/night because obvious parking would in the mall's garages.  However the Mall does not stay open as late as Maggiano's.  I would suggest parking at a casino across the street to save yourself the confusion.

All in all, the experience was great and the price was not bad either.  For all items listed above, the total came to about $150 and fed 4 adults and one child with leftovers.  I will be going back in the future and would happily suggest Maggiano's to anyone!"}
{"text":"No need to check for a review
This place is Great!!!!!!!
Everything they have on menu is great!
The service is excellent the scenery is excellent the prices are excellent easy access to get to.
 I eat  here five times a month."}
{"text":"Oh my word, where do I begin? I was with a party of 14 so we ate family style. First the chopped salad with prosciutto and bruschetta came, and I was already impressed. Then the spinach artichoke dip, so creamy! Up next was Chef Mann's Country-Style Pasta, the chicken ricotta meatballs were crispy and tender (soooooo good). We had two different kinds of chicken. Chicken Saltimbocca (my favourite) and Chicken Piccata. For dessert we ended with coffee, cheesecake, and chocolate cake which was very moist and fluffy. I wish I were eating more of that chocolate cake right now and I'm so full if I coughed I'd puke. It was that good. The service was fantastic. I can't wait until next time. I already know what I will order!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations based on the reviews but were very disappointed. Calamari was extremely salty and overcooked (dark brown). Lasagna was cold in the middle. Seafood was strong flavored suggesting it was fresh.  Paste was overcooked and mushy.  Bread was stale.  Price was way out of range from quality ($100 for two people)."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment decision to eat at maggiano's food was good not great and service lacked in every way horrible is being nice.  They had an excuse for everything. Do not recommend. Wait staff was not professional."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Antonio, was AH-MAZE-ING!!! He took the best care of us. The most incredible service. Love him!!!!"}
{"text":"Located at the Fashion Show Mall, it's better setting than a food court .. but compared to other Maggiano's, there's major skimping when it comes to portions.  The chain is known for large family-style portions but the ones here weren't that large and insufficient to share with more than one person.

Food's ok but nothing to write home about (in fact, if you're home, you'd probably have a better experience at your nearby Maggiano's)."}
{"text":"Dined here for a special event.. Our party were approached be a highly rude and inappropriate blond middle aged woman who, stated that our entire party would have to wait in the heat for 30min for a table when there were numerous free tables with no reservations. Both woman (hosts) were extremely rude and unaccommodating which baffled our party as this has been the worst service and experience we have encountered since arriving in the USA. Do not waste your time or money on such rude people as this has left a sour taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 10 and ordered The Chef's Choice from the family style menu. 

For apps we had:
Mozzarella Marinara 
Jumbo Large Crab Cakes
Italian Tossed Salad.

For entrees we had:
Beef Tenderloin Medallions
Veal Marsala
Rustic Chicken & Shrimp
Balsamic-Glazed Salmon

And dessert...
Tiramisu
Chocolate Zuccotto Cake

I cannot speak to the seafood items because I'm allergic, but everything at the table was devoured quickly. The beef tenderloin was delicious!  Fork-tender and the platter included gravy & mashed potatoes. Mozzarella marinara was yummy, cheese melting but not scorching hot.  Tiramisu tasted very fresh with lot of flavor, cake had layers of mousse & ganache, also good.
I really enjoyed my meal, but it is A LOT of food.  We have enough leftovers to send us all home with something for lunch tomorrow.
Our waitress was Rosa, and she was a sweetheart, making sure we had drinks and utensils and more & more food!"}
{"text":"Much better experience than the Santana Row, San Jose, CA location.
The servers, staff, food were excellent. 
Everyone was polite. The location was much nicer and more central to the strip. We had a great time. We had a nice family dinner and enjoyed every aspect."}
{"text":"We've been here many times before and have visited this restaurant in other locations.  There is a good one in west end of Richmond, Virginia in nice shopping center that has a Nordstrom's and other high end stores.  Restaurant was very crowded and parties waiting, but we were seated immediately for our reservation.  A very nice roomy booth for husband and me.  Started off a little slow with no plates for the bread and olive oil and it took about 10 minutes for cocktail to arrive.  But our waiter was very attentive thereafter, made some good recommendations and we started with the steamed mussels (a favorite).  The excellent broth was mildly garlicy and the canneloni beans and pieces of sundried tomatoes made the dish.  Chopped salad had blue cheese and crispy prosciutto - Yum.  I had the chicken florentine (enough for 2 people) and stuffed with ricotta, spinach and a cream sauce was very good.  Husband had the Linguini di Mare which we've both had before with prawns, more mussels etc in delicious light tomato broth.  As usual, the meal didn't disappoint and we had food to bring home!"}
{"text":"A great place for a great meal and abundance of food. Always look for Maggiano's when we travel."}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis and sometimes good and sometimes just OK. This last visit was just OK."}
{"text":"Good Italian food although the hostess took forever to seat us. Our server was much better and the food was good. We got the chopped salad which was great and the pesto, chicken, pine nut linguine. It actually wasn't spectacular but it was much better later that night for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been give the task of going to Maggiano's and buying a carryout order of small angel hair pasta with mariana.  Easy right.   Large Italian restaurant a popular type pasta.  Guess what I fail because Maggiano doesn't have it.  I get spaghetti. I'm told they don't have it.  When I get to my mother in law's house, she's thinking seriously I give you one thing to do and you can't even do that.   Thank you Maggiano's for my huge fail.  I will go to olive garden next time."}
{"text":"Typically I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, however the meal here was good.  They have a good size menu with all the Italian classics.  When you leave they give you a cold pasta dish to take home. Honestly I have had better dinners at this chain than some of the fancy Italian places. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Just had a terrific dinner! Our table looked out over the Strip. I had the lasagna , my wife had the eggplant parmesan. We started with side salads that were as large as an entree salad. Finished with an apple pastry dessert that was excellent. Large portions that are reasonably priced considering the location."}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say!! Great food definitely didtinctive in their own way and yes the stuffed mushrooms are as good as everyone says they are. Thanks yelpers you did good on this one!"}
{"text":"Oh man.  I would never give a one star unless it was necessary.  Went on lunch tried to find my favorite place Flo's and found that it was gone so we saw this nice pretty place that appeared to be upscale and ready to serve something good.

Big disappointment.  Sat in the bar area so I will only judge this area.  Not crowded after all it was just after lunch time but everyone seemed to act in a rush.  Waiter was sweating, dirty fingernails(like fungus under nails)  plates were dirty appeared to be ignored because they sit out overnight and no one changes them.  Utensils disfigured.  Lunch (i ordered peppercorn steak) was not the way it should have been cooked I could do better at home.  Potatoes tasted like they were from fridge to microwave.  My daughters pasta was dried out and the stuffed chicken was not moist.  

I got sick when I got home and don't know what item did it.  for 80bucks I expected a little better than that.  Maybe they do better at their the italian food but if you put an item on the menu do it right.  I felt rushed the whole time.  Felt like everyone was trying to abandon ship and we got the last food out the fridge.

oh well live and learn."}
{"text":"I still crave for the food of this restaurant. Its been almost a year since i had a real good food here. The Chef came to our table to check if we got the right thing as we were vegetarians."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding dinner here with a small group of guests (13 total). We did a family style dinner which I was allowed to order before we arrived so everything would be brought out without waiting a long time. The food was delicious! We had a lot of food left over for lunch the next day.....it tasted even better! Our waiter was fabulous as well as very friendly. Family style is definitely the way to go if you have a big group and are on a tight budget. 
Thank you everyone at Maggiano's!!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about italian food, but this is way better than olive garden! The spaghetti and meatball dish is really yummy! salads and appetizers are good too. portions are really big, even the half orders. I think the half orders are still a pound of pasta. Tiramisu is bomb, too. I'll go back every time I crave some spaghetti."}
{"text":"I personally thinks it's AMAZING.... I love how the servers are always checking up on .... today my server Tyler was amazing I absolutely loved how she served us ... the food was great today I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and got chicken with it and extra sauce because the sauce is amazing ... she served us with a great smile and great personality what I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE... 

Me and my partner walked in at 12 around lunch time not busy .... and we got seated right away ... ( I recommend getting seated next to the far end right next to the window to see the strip) our server Tyler brought bread very quickly and I asked for sauce and she gladly brought it .... she took our order about 10 minutes later our food was brought to the table and it was amazing such a beautiful dish .... we order dessert next and what can I say the tiramisu is beyond amazing it just MELTS in your mouth.....

This restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurant I've gone so far ... I can even say it's better than Olive Garden.... I would most definitely be back a billion times"}
{"text":"I decided to take some new friends out for a special meal and it was supposed to be an enjoyable time out with them and their kids. I made reservations for 4 pm for a party of 8. I intentionally made the reservation for 4 in order to avoid the large crowd that would be arriving from 5 onward. All of us arrived a few minutes before 4 pm. Despite the fact that THE ENTIRE ROOM WAS EMPTY where we would be seated, we had to stand in the waiting area for 20 minutes before we were seated. We ordered 2 Fried Zucchini appetizers. After they arrived, we noticed that no spoons were brought to use for the sauce. Since the waiter never came back, and the zucchini would have gotten cold if we had waited, we had to tip pour the sauce from the bowl onto our zucchini, which made a huge mess. We ordered our food next. Finally, when the waiter came back, we asked for bread, which we should not have had to ask for, since it comes with the meals. The bread came (one little basket that did not contain enough for eight people). We asked for butter with the bread THREE times. The waiter actually had the nerve to get an attitude and was very unfriendly. Finally, a manager came out with a plate of butter 45 minutes AFTER we asked for it. The bread was gone at this point and therefore we had no need for the butter. Our friend had to ask for balsamic vinegar THREE times as well. It was absolutely ridiculous. We finally got to order our food. It took TWO HOURS for our food to arrive. Imagine 2 kids (ages 8 and 10) sitting for TWO HOURS waiting for food. NONE of us ordered anything other than simple pasta dishes - plus the 2 kids ordered from the kids menu. WE watched a family of 5, who arrived AFTER us, receive and consume their entire meal before ours even arrived and another family came and took their place and were finished eating when we were! It was absolutely outrageous. When the food finally did arrive it was not as ordered. I ordered a salad with dressing on the side and no olives. The salad came drenched with dressing and had olives. My friend ordered a salad as well. Hers came with no dressing whatsoever - not even any on the side - despite the fact that she did not ask for it this way. My friend ordered coffee to come with the desert and the coffee never came. She told the waiter to forget about the coffee because we were done with dessert. While we were packing our food up, a waitress came to our table with an entire plate of food that we DID NOT ORDER and tried leaving it with us. When the bill came it had NUMEROUS mistakes. First of all, the coffee was still on there. We were charged for TWO salads that we did not order. We were also charged for an ENTIRE MEAL that we did not purchase and my husband was charged extra for substituting chicken for sausage in one of the pasta dishes - although the waiter said there would be no upcharge and this was a valid substitution. We sent the bill back and everything was corrected except the coffee was still on the bill. It was unreal. So we had to wait even longer to get the bill corrected once again. We were at this restaurant for OVER 3 HOURS. We came at 4 and did not get out until a little after 7. WE should not have had to be in this restaurant for more than 1 hour 45 minutes TOPS. It was an absolute fiasco and it was a very stressful dining experience.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Great food. Gigantic portions! Normally I would never order a chicken dish when I dine out but thier chicken marsala is amazing! Do yourself a favor and get the butter cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"I would come here for happy hour and appetizers but we didn't enjoy our dinner at all. I ordered the chicken piccata and it came drowned in butter. I know it's a lemon butter sauce but it was ALL butter and very little lemon. The broccolini was also drowned in butter. My husband ordered the veal porterhouse and guess what? It was drowned in butter. The food was terrible, bland and heavy. Maybe their sauces are where it's at. The bruschetta was really good and the service was excellent as well. Not sure if we would go back. Maybe and try the spaghetti."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here. The wait staff was awesome and very attentive. Went there with a group of 15 which usually causes problems but they were able to handle us and kept the food and drinks coming. The food was very good, especially the fried zucchini appetizers and the chicken parm and cedar roasted salmon. I will go here again if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland area and decided to try Maggianos.  Our waiter, Adam, could not have treated us any better.  The food was superb and our visit was one we will brag about to friends and family."}
{"text":"We went to this location with my Husband and his family to celebrate his birthday. It took us 10 minutes to find a parking spot, the place was completely packed. We were a party of 10 people and we waited about 15 minutes for our large party to be seated. It was 100% worth the wait. The server was very patient with all of our questions. My particularly picky mother-in-law even sent her wine back and he still was kind and understanding. I had the JLohr cab it was delicious. I choose to have classic Italian ravioli. It came with this amazing pesto sauce drizzled on top of the cheesy filled ravioli. The server even offered a free portion to take home. At the end my mother in law asked the server to remind her of a dish to order the next time she dines there... And do you know what he did he put it in her notes. Great place for a family get together. Fabulous service. It made my husbands birthday. Thanks. We Can't wait to go again soon."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the server was very enjoyable to talk to, made the visit very fun and entertaining, nothing took to long and the hospitality there was just incredible, definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Best lil Italian brewhaus in LAS. The crew were on top of it all. Always come here whenever I'm in Vegas. Or back home, too. Samtana row side."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have ever had from a chain restaurant!  If you are staying in Vegas, get out of your hotel and take a walk to Maggiano's.  You will need the walk back to your hotel to help digest the fantastic meal you just ate.  I have eaten at Maggiano's a number of times around the country and now I find myself seeking them out when I travel.  If you like calamari you must try theirs.  I think my favorite dish so far is Mom's Lasagna.  Be sure to save room for the Tiramisu or Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.  They also have a very good wine list."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The Bacon Brushetta appetizer was to die for. Amazing service by our waitress Nicole. Cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Joey was our waiter and he was the best host we had on The Strip.  Top notch pro. 

I had the veggie pasta primavera and my date had the baked ziti.  Both were terrific and the Nonna's pound cake finished it all off.

Would gladly return."}
{"text":"The food at this particular location was average, but Luke warm by the time it made it to the table.  Our server, Tommy, was absolutely horrible.  We ordered drinks, he forgot to bring them.  We ordered the dinner for two, he forgot half of it.  He seemed more interested in socializing than actually doing his job."}
{"text":"Great service and so very delicous!  Stuffed mushrooms, pasta, salad, chicken saltimboca - all was so well prepared  - just wonderful.  Large portions, love it for my family!"}
{"text":"I am married to an Italian, and she said this is the place to go to for good Italian food.  She was right!   Location, atmosphere, attentive service , it was nice. It is a bit pricey for me, so it will be more of a special occasion location, but I enjoyed it.  Lasagna was terrific."}
{"text":"A Birthday and Anniversary celebration - What better way to spend  celebrating a special occasion but with best friends enjoying a great family style dinner.  We shared two different salads - caesar and chopped. Our appetizers consisted of the best ever fried zucchini and steamed mussels...and because we were eating family style...there was no fighting...the waitress just brought us more!   Then our entree's were plentiful as they kept them coming until we raised the white flag. The beef medallions were fabulous as well as the lobster ravioli...BUT the hit of the night is Maggiano's famous  Rigatoni D, one of the best dishes any of us have ever had, truly heavenly. The thin cream sauce flavored with Marsala wine is just perfection that you want to scrape the bowl. I wish Birthdays came more often as Maggiano's is my place to look forward to every year..and even more often when I am good."}
{"text":"A huge thank you to Magliano's Little Italy for taking food allergies so seriously. It is never expected but always appreciated when a restaurant goes above and beyond in regards to food allergies. The front desk staff, the servers, and the chef all take such great care of the food allergic population. The chef even comes out to the table to go over everything (ingredients etc). We are so very grateful for the entire staff and their care for the allergic community."}
{"text":"Food was very good!  Restaurant was packed a bit too tight for me but it was Friday evening.  Staff was courteous but it took a while to get our food and dessert was even longer.  Overall worth it because we just talked more but if I was in a hurry it would have been annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I go to Maggianos I forget that it is a chain. The waitstaff is always professional and nice. I went with a Maggiano virgin and the server came out with a sample of fried 4 cheese ravioli! OMG it was so good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because at time the food doesn't live up to the hype (sometimes). But any place where I order a classic dish and they automatically box another for me to go, that's what I'm about! And the peach bellini is a must!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate his recent promotion at work. The staff was courteous, professional and attentive. Our server was never intrusive and visited our table at the right times throughout the night. We stayed for almost two hours but never felt rushed even though we didn't come in until 9. Thanks for creating a special experience!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience...rather old world. The food was excellent..I had the chicken piccata...with angel hair pasta...and DO recommend it! The service was great...good wine list...but the wines were quite over priced...
Good acoustics...even the restaurant had two levels...with ver high ceilings...the noise level was not bad at all."}
{"text":"When I visited Vegas (February 28th), this was one of the places I wanted to dine at again. I had the Chicken Frances, it was cooked to perfection. The noodles were fresh and the chicken was buttery. My companion had the Shrimp Diavolo. It was perfectly spicy and the shrimp was plentiful and plump. The salad was flavorful, excellent. The atmosphere was a perfect mix of casual, not so much formal. The wait staff was impressive and our table had a lovely view of the Las Vegas Strip. I would highly recommend and I will visit there again when I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I am not sure who reviews this place, but I know now it is not worth the rating that it is receiving. 

We went here for dinner on a Sunday night supposedly low season in Vegas. The place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.

We ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer. The grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes.  Kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.

- Crab cakes were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice
- Mussels in red sauce (Diablo if I remember well). When served they smelled funny. My first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. Some spaghetti strings were visible, so I was wondering where the sauce really came from?! But, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that I could not eat these mussels. Returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. Manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay.
- Salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. Not very appetizing to see, I like grilled fish to remain dry when served. The potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed.
- Flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal
- Spaghetti with giant meatball; I am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting. 

We were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service. 

Overall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food."}
{"text":"OK... it's a chain so some folks will knock off points just BECAUSE! However, it is hard to knock excellent service, delicious food, accommodating special requests, and BOGO classic pastas! So YES... five stars. Now for the details... party of four...

we had a reservation & were seated promptly on a Friday evening at 6:30PM. Our waitress Patricia brought menus, took drink orders, soon brought drinks & complimentary bread, poured olive oil onto plates for each of the four of us in our party (celebrating a birthday but did not inform her of that). She asked if we had any questions about the menu & prepared to take our orders. 

I had looked online and thought I wanted the four cheese ravioli... BUT the menu said it came with a pesto sauce. NOT MY PREFERENCE so I asked about a substitution... meat sauce instead. NO PROBLEM, said Patricia (& same price). Oh & add a side of meatballs... when brought out with my meal, there were 2 the size of tennis balls: tender & tasty in a small bowl with marinara.

Other orders were eggplant parmesan w spaghetti & marinara, baked ziti with sausage & pomodoro sauce, and seared scallops special with pasta and sauce. The \"house\" Pinot Noir was particularly good, too.

Lest anyone think that (good) plain olive oil poured onto a plate is bland, be imaginative! Add fresh ground black pepper from the peppermill on the table... and grated parm, also on the table. If you need more kick, ask for some crushed red pepper flakes! MMMM, so good with the complimentary dense bread with refills as needed.

Toward the end of the meal, Patricia returned and informed three of us who had ordered classic pasta dishes that THEY ARE A DEAL that includes ANOTHER OF EQUAL or LESSER VALUE to take home for another day! Only the seared scallop special did not qualify for the BOGO deal.

Dessert... Maggiano's Tiramisu really is \"to die for\" good! And the coffee is also quite good. The ONLY thing that was not excellent this visit was the Crème Brulee which was not as creamy & light as offerings at other places we've been. I would recommend another choice... LIKE the Tiramisu which even LOOKS as special as it tastes!

As we left, one in the party wondered WHY we did not come to Maggiano's more often? Perhaps it is because someone else chose Maggiano's this night because the birthday person chooses... but usually defers to THAT one's choices when this foursome goes out! lol

Valet parking is available... offered by the mall at curbside outside Maggiano's... reasonable and very convenient.

ALSO Maggiano's offers FAMILY STYLE MEALS as a dining option. This can be great fun... we went to a family 50th anniversary party (a few years ago) at Maggiano's for about 40 people. We were served family style which provided an opportunity to try new menu items that might not have been chosen otherwise due to \"playing it safe\" when ordering.

It will not be years before we go back to Maggiano's... my wife said we should go back again soon. Just us... or with a couple/group. As someone else remarked... consistency is a good thing when it means consistently good service and consistently good food! Maggiano's IS consistent!

Maggiano's blends casual dining, excellent food/service, & white table cloths into an enjoyable dining experience for all ages. While there I also saw several plates that looked very appetizing: lasagna (next time) unless I order that HUGE SERVING of clams I saw being enjoyed at a nearby table."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible! 

This was my first and LAST experience at Maggiano's in Beachwood. I was excited to take my parents, husband and daughter there for our first time today for Mother's day weekend. We drove an hour to get there and had a reservation. A person from our party (my brother) was late showing up so the snotty hostess said she would \"partially check us in\" until my brother arrived. My brother was a no-show and we waited 30 minutes in the crowded lobby with a very restless and hungry toddler. I don't understand why the hostess couldn't just seat us and when/if my brother showed up, he would just find us and join us. 

Our waitress was not very attentive or pleasant. She ignored us all needing drink refills and another server actually came up and filled our drinks for us. We ordered crab cakes and mozzarella marina appetizers. The crab cakes came out and there were only 2, and they were dry and flavorless. The mozzarella marina was two flat breaded mozzarella \"sticks\" smothered in sauce. It made it awkward to try to cut it into pieces for us all to have some. We were thinking they would be mozzarella sticks, guess not. 

The food took forever and we were already annoyed and my daughter was very hungry at this point. It's hard to keep a restless hungry 3 yr old entertained for an hour  wait for food. I think our waitress forgot to put our order in and she even came by to say \"the chef sends his apology for the long wait\" They forgot to bring out my dads ceasar sald, my mom said the coffee even sucked. 

My daughters kids chicken breast was undercooked and looked like a fake, frozen formed chicken breast. My husbands lasagna was extremely dry and had no sauce on it. My mom and I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was very oily with a nasty tasty seafood sauce and I could make better at home. My dads chicken francese was the same fake, frozen chicken breast as my daughters and they forgot to bring out his side of potatoes until he called the server out on it in which she seemed annoyed rather than apologetic. 

The manager came around to our table to make rounds & when he asked how everything was my husband told him about our experience. He did offer to comp the potatoes and offered up dessert sampler, but we declined it since it had ice cream and we were already there for 2 hrs and wanted to leave and not take ice cream to go with us. He did end up taking off $30 from our bill and that was the only saving grace, but I will NOT be back!! 

Overall Maggianos was loud, crowded, cramped and very dark. The outside looks better than the inside. The staff was snotty, not attentive and rude. The food was flavorless and not very good. You could make better at home, or eat somewhere better and save your money as they overcharge for the crap that they put out!"}
{"text":"What a great place to take your wife for a top notch meal experience. We highly recommend Richard as your server."}
{"text":"I went their for my husbands birthday the food was really good ... Omg the four cheese ravioli are the best if you're planning to go you have to try them :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food 

Only bad was that they sat us down somewhere then moved us around before we got a nice table. 
It was just inconvenient because we were celebrating a birthday.  Other than that everything was good serve was nice food was good as well."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the price was really nice for Vegas but the service was awful! After checking in and wanting to sit on the patio we waited a long time to be seated. I had to stare down one of the 3 hostesses before they sat us and the wait staff made us wait a lot."}
{"text":"My server was good but I had aT leased three other waiters walk by and made insulting remarks. This is uncalled for they started to group me with under voice remarks, calling me girls names And  saying that I suck someone like I'm gay but not I'm sitting with my wife  now other people sitting close by started to help them. One of the waiters just called me queen. I think this is a place where they don't like gays"}
{"text":"The Location is perfect to travelers and night view from the window seats is wonderful. Average food quality is good, but some sea food menu, such as a  Linguini di Mare are extremely salty. I could not eat at all. However stuffed mushroom is the best!! I also like their happy hour drink menu. (3-6PM)"}
{"text":"Consistency is the hallmark of any great restaurant. The great taste of Maggiano's food is as consistent as the terribleness of an Adam Sandler movie.

Since Maggiano's is a chain, I really want to give it four stars because duh, that's what a snob would do. The food is delicious, but it's not mind-blasting. However, Maggiano's serves family-style, old-fashioned Italian dishes. They're not re-inventing the wheel, but they don't have to.

I have never had anything but great experiences here; the consistency alone would be enough for that 1 or 2 more stars. That and the calamari. Every restaurant should have calamari on the menu; calamari this good and with as many tentacles. The Shrimp Fra Diavolo and Fettucine Alfredo are my two classic and delicious go to staples at this restaurant.

The fare is traditional with few trendy takes on Italian food. Personally, I'm not one for goat cheese lasagna or short rib scampi or zucchini and eggplant tacos. A meal at Maggiano's sits in your stomach like five pounds of cement, the way a REAL Italian meal should. I know to wear my loosest & most forgiving pants when I dine here.

The service is courteous and attentive. The atmosphere is bright, roomy and elegant. I sort of wish they enforced some sort of dress code. Not just so that it would feel fancier but also because I abhor track suits and crocs in public spaces."}
{"text":"I always try to find good in my ratings....My husband thought it was delicious, he had the baked ziti.  The staff was attentive, including the manager, no complaints there.  It was very crowded but to be expected on a Saturday night.  We also had the tomato caprese as a shared appetizer. It had very good flavor.  However, my meal was awful, the worst.  I ordered the shrimp scampi.  It had a lot of shrimp, that was surprising.  But that is the best thing I can say about it.  it was very watery, not buttery.  No garlic flavor whatsoever.  Very little pasta.  I had the server bring me some lemon to try and jazz it up a little.  No luck.  It was super disappointing.  I should have sent it back but my husband was already enjoying his meal and I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for my dish to come out.      

I had eaten here in the past for lunch and it was good, but that was about five years ago."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. For appetizer we had the zucchini fritte which was my husbands favorite. We also ordered a side of Caesar salad which needed more dressing so we asked for more. We also ordered the tomato basil soup, not the best soup Ive had, it's too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil. For our entree we got the chicken Marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried. I had the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken. My Alfredo sauce was alright, not my favorite I think Olive Garden has better Alfredo fettuccine. Overall not bad for lunch but for Italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice!"}
{"text":"Siraya was the one bright spot in our visit.  Sweet, helpful, and presented us with wonderful service.  The food was mediocre, and I was disappointed that the only thing I was interested in on the menu they were out of.  If we gave this place another shot it would be specifically to see our lovely server and enjoy a well made negroni."}
{"text":"I usually like Maggiano's, especially when I come with a big group. 

The view from this location is great, because it's right above the Strip, so you can see everything around the Wynn, which is right across the street. 

The host staff was polite, the food was quick, but our server was NONE OF THE ABOVE! He basically did everything short of rolling his eyes at us. 

What a mood killer. And meal killer. And Maggiano's killer."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a week.  We happened to walk by Maggiano's and my husband decided he wanted to try this.  We did show up on a VERY busy Friday night without a reservation and we were ok with that.  They only had space at the bar, we were ok with that. 
 
We placed our order and I had asked for lemon with my water.  As she was busy, I waited and waited and waited.  Finally asked the bus boy for some lemon and he brought it almost immediately.  She \"happened\" to walk by, saw the lemon and said \"Oh, you got your lemon?\"  I told her that the bus boy had brought, her response \"Yeah, I asked him to, just checking that he brought it.\"  WTF?  She lied!!!!!

From when we sat down to when we were served our appetizers, an hour had gone by.  When we asked the waitress about our appetizers, she became a  little aggressive and said she was doing the best she could.  When we finally got our appetizers, we asked her to bring the main course as soon as possible, didn't know how long we would have to wait. 

Food not bad but certainly not impressed with the waitress."}
{"text":"Took wifey and little one out on a lunch one afternoon after strolling in the mall. I finally decided to check this place out for what it really is.

I ordered the lobster carbonara while wifey got the steak with mushroom for lunch. As for her dish, she said she loved it! The mushroom gravy was very rich and being the fact that she loves mushroom it was all worthit from her aside from me who is not a mushroom eater. LOL! As for my lobster meal it was an excellent dish, little one and I shared it and the portion is huge for a lunch meal so two person can share it if theyre not that hungry.

5 stars for the food and minus 1 for the service it was very slow. I needed refill but the waiter never seem to care and just kept passing us by."}
{"text":"Maggianos is one of my favorite place to eat in North Carolina. The pesto pasta two thumbs up. All of the pasta plates are delicious.( yes I've tried them all) and the buy one take home  best deal you can find. Cheese cake the best come check them out you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"First let me say I really enjoy the food and atmosphere at Maggianos.  We go there often, but unfortunately, I can't say the same for their Thanksgiving Dinner menu.  We made reservations for 5:00 pm (a month ago) at their Las Vegas location and they did not seat us until 6:15 pm.  I was not happy, but really try to make the best of this special day.  Waiter was overworked, came to our table maybe three times.  I felt like the whole thing was a big rush, did not enjoy at all.  Could have stayed home, cooked and saved the money we spent.  I will go back, but not on any major holidays.  Oh yeah last but not least THE FOOD was mediocre!  I know, I can't believe it!  The best part of that night was leaving.  That comment was from my 7 yo son.  Lol"}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best place ever! You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. 

My family goes here often for special occasions and on the weekends when we are tired of the other Italian food chains. We always get the family style dinner and it is about $30 per person. Not bad when you get appetizers, salads, entrees, and dessert!! And you can ask for more if you want. They will bring it out! 

I have been with my boyfriend and sister on many occasions to go and buy one of their pasta entrees and get another one for free to take home. You cannot beat this deal. I always get the Mom's Lasagna and take the Ravioli home. Their lasagna is soooooo good!!! I could eat it for days and never get tired of it. My favorite salad is the Maggiano's salad. It has blue cheese crumbles and bacon bits. The dressing for that salad is awesome. 

Oh and by the way....set a reservation...you will thank me!"}
{"text":"love maggianos! service is great and food is excellent-cant beat the buy one take one free dinner-bread is awesome-awesome meatballs and good portions"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Location is great right across from the Wynn. Food was okay but our extremely slow service ruined our lunch all together."}
{"text":"4 +.   Yes, it's a chain & pretty much the same in all their locations, but it is just so damn good.  (PSST  there's a $10 off $30 purchase coupon available on their website) 

We were seated at the time on our reservation and treated to very attentive service.  The house chianti was good.  Bread was served soon after we were seated and waiter was kind enough to bring out some red pepper flakes and Italian herbs that we could add to the olive oil.

The waiter explained that they were no longer doing half orders & I thought I understood him to say that the menu had been redone and the portions as well as prices were now smaller.  No matter--the lady at the next table had a rather large platter of food and I was pretty sure we weren't going hungry.  I had linguine with shrimp & garlic  (what, I like red wine with that), and my friend had the rustic chicken & shrimp.  I love that they are not afraid to use the garlic here.  My shrimp were big and cooked perfectly and the sauce enhanced it beautifully without overwhelming the seafood.  And there were leftovers (just as good for breakfast the next day).  For around $16 a plate (before the coupon), it's hard to find food this good in Vegas."}
{"text":"I recently dined at this Maggiano's and it was wonderful. I have never had such a great experience dining by myself at the bar with the bartender Stephanie. The food was fresh the calamari was tender the salad was crunchy and crispy and the flavors were delectable. I spoke with one manager briefly I believe his name was Jesse he made sure I was well taken care of and was enjoying myself, another young lady who is a manager and very beautiful also make sure I was well taken care of I want to say her name was Christmas? She had dark reddish brown hair with bangs and she was tall and stunning but very professional if only I could of have the courage to ask her for her phone number. Stephanie is a great bartender and made a wicked delicious sangria it's always good when you can't taste the alcohol in your drink that means it's really good! I will definitely be back and hopefully I'll run into Christmas and Stephanie, those ladies are awesome and easy on the eyes to."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very family friendly. The food was absolutely amazing. I recommend the tiramisu for desert! :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't disappointed.  The food was so-so.  I didn't have very high expectations as Brinker tends to deliver \"middle-of-the-road\" experiences with most all of their endeavors.  This was no exception.  Not bad, not good...I can't really describe it well enough to do it justice.  The food was bland and tasted like it came out of a can.  Highly forgettable."}
{"text":"Very good. I ordered Chicken Parm and fettuccine Alfredo. It was close to the best I've ever had. Negatives: only Italian resturant I've ever been to that didn't serve garlic bread. Didn't love the appetizer menu. Not much variety. Very overpriced. Veal chop cost almost 40 dollars. Would have given 4 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this restaurant.  Maggiano's  is one of my favorite restaurants in the Chicago area. However, this restaurant left me homesick for the Maggiano's from Chicago. I don't know what they are doing here but the food didn't taste the same, sad."}
{"text":"After walking for what seemed hours(and probably was), my family and I decided to eat here.  It's conveniently located in the Fashion Show Mall...so after a day's shopping and gambling at the nearby Venetian and Palazzo...some Italian food sounded good.
We went around 3PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We were immediately seated and service was prompt.  
The appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again.
My dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  I probably wouldn't order it again.
My mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead.
My brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.
Overall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.  About $60 for three of us including appetizer and drinks."}
{"text":"Best chain Italian food spot in charlotte so far.."}
{"text":"Not sure how you could gove this place anything other than 5 stars? What you get for the price is amazing. I honestly don't know how they stay open charging you for one meal and giving you another one to go home for free!? The food is amazing on top of that. Looking from the outside, I thought the place would be super expensive. Even though they do have expensive options ($30 a plate), they also have inexpensive options ($10-15 a plate) and you get another meal to go for free! It ends up being $5- $7.50 for each meal. Crazy! The service and ambience are always great. Really cool place. Everytime we go we have a great time. I couldn't reccommend it enough."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The only time I come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring: (1) the extremely young; and (2) the extremely old.  I've never independently chosen to eat here.

I will say they have their sh$t together when it comes to large private gatherings.  They're always well staffed and organized, unlike other spots in town (*cough* PJ Clarkes *cough*).  The private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows -- you're not in some afterthought back room.

Further, the portions they provide for groups are enormous.  Even if there are 10 people at a table, it never runs out.  In fact, I usually get stuck with taking home leftovers.  Just what I always wanted, 4 lbs of artichoke dip......

BUT, large portions aren't really a godsend if the food is just meh.  I've had the chicken & eggplant parmesan, chicken piccata, penne with meat sauce, spagetti, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms, calamari, profiteroles and...... none of it was memorable. 

Overall, they serve up very basic Italian food meant to please the masses......something easily achieved when the patrons are seven-years-old....."}
{"text":"Maggianos has a wonderful ambiance, loud enough to talk comfortably but not too loud to hear one another, the wood work and finishes are pleasing to the eye and make you believe you are in a fine dining establishment, service is not bad at all, very smiley in fact
Bread, olive oil and balsamic were tasty, so was the creamy tomato basil soup and the house white sangria was great, summery  and refreshing, perfect for the 104 temps in Vegas now. 
But the entrées were Olive Garden worthy at best (I've only been to Olive Garden once, but that's how I remember it), gluttonous servings with extra sauce or garlic butter, trying to please the American palate, in my opinion, instead of authentic Italian, which I believe is simple fresh quality ingredients made with care. 
Now the price for the place is pretty reasonable, especially for being on the strip, so maybe heading over for happy hour, 3-6 pm, would be a better experience, the bartender seemed to know what he was doing, but as for dinner I would pass"}
{"text":"I made a reservation to celebrate two birthdays.  The girl asked if there was anyone in our party that would find it difficult to climb a flight of stairs, if necessary.  I thought that was very considerate as there was someone in our party that had recently had knee surgery on both her knees.
I made the reservation for 6:30.  By the time we got there, our table was all ready for us.

After we sat down, we were served with a basket of bread with plates of olive oil and a dish of grated cheese.  Delicious bread, by the way.  So delicious, we asked for another basket of it, which they didn't charge us for, by the way.  Other restaurants do that, even for the first basket.  (Shame on them.)

Our food was great!  One of us had the $12.99 Classic Pasta dish, which he thoroughly enjoyed and devoured.  Growing boy of 21.  lol.
The good thing about that offer is that you can choose a different dish for taking home than what you ate dining in.  The bad thing is, you can't order it with substitutes as they're already made up.  

I had the Grilled Salmon Lemon and Herb.  I wasn't really looking for something that would be a lot and heavy in my stomach, so this was perfect.  Not a big serving, but perfect for what I was looking for and healthy, too.

The wine list left a bit to be desired.  I could only find one wine that I liked on it that wouldn't break the bank.

Since we were celebrating two bdays, we both got a plate of their homemade lemon cookies, which were delicious.  I'm not a big fan of lemon cookies because they're usually very tart in flavor.  These were not.  They were a little tart, but more sweet than anything.

The only parts of our visit that I didn't quite care for was that our server was a bit scarce.  We had to hunt her down to get more water or refresh our bread basket/drinks.  The other thing was that we felt rushed after we got done eating.  Some of us would've liked a cup of coffee or something, but as soon as the check came, we paid and left.  No \"is there anything else I can get you?\" or anything."}
{"text":"Good food - uneven service

Went for lunch twice this week with a friend. The first time we had mussels, chicken caprese and creme brulée for dessert. The second time we had mussels, lobster carbonara, and strawberry pie for dessert. Both times the mussels were some of the best we've ever had. The chicken caprese with its olive tapenade was far superior to the bland tasting lobster carbonara. Both desserts were excellent. Portion sizes were large. Coffee both times was lukewarm and on the weak side. 

The service the first time was exceptional. Extraordinarily attentive, professional yet friendly. The second time the server was pleasant, but the bread came late, silverware was missing for the coffee, as was the cream. The entree arrived before we finished our mussels (which we were eating at an average dining pace.) The appetizer dishes were not removed from our table for several minutes after we finished so we moved those dishes to an empty table next to us.

This would have been a regular spot for us if the service had been similar the second time, but now we will go back just for the mussels - they are to die for!"}
{"text":"I and my family were staying on the strip and we were looking for a great Italian restaurant on the strip. Yelp and other online reviews were great so we thought we will give it a try. As soon as we went inside, they said the wait time is 15' which wasn't too bad. My sis-in-law had a baby so she had a stroller with her and baby was asleep at that time. After 15' we went inside and they said the stroller is not allowed. My sis-in-law explained that the baby is asleep and it would be nice of them to accommodate the stroller. The waiter told to some lady and she allowed to have the stroller inside. The stroller was kept near the pillar so that it is not in anyone's way. We had 2-3 different servers for this visit. One took the order for water. The round table had 5 chairs but only 3 appetizer plates on them! We were total 4. Had to tell the waiter to get us 1 more plate. Then we had ordered 2 soups (tomato-basil) and since they did not split in half, we had asked for separate bowls. They brought the soup but not bowls! Although we told them to get the bowls, after drinking half the soup from the bowl, still we did not get the empty bowls. Then we told another server to get the bowls. By the time we got empty bowls, soup was done! we had shared from the same bowl.However, apart from their service, the Soup tasted Excellent! For the appetizer, we had ordered Fried Mozzarella with Marinara Sauce on top. The Mozzarella was Terrific and too heavy. We got 4 pieces and just 1 piece filled our stomach! I will surely recommend Tomato-basil soup and Fried Mozzarella! 
For entree, we had Angel Primavera with vegetables and 4 Cheese Ravioli. Since we are vegetarians, We had Angel Primavera with vegetables. Although, the taste was blend, except for me, rest 3 of them liked it. To me it was okay. I would have loved it with extra sauce, seasonings and olive oil. It looked bit dry. The 4 Cheese Ravioli was Excellent. Very creamy light green color sauce and light marinara on top of ravioli and soft cheese inside the ravioli and nicely baked cheese on top. Again the Ravioli filled us up with all the cheese..! Lastly we thought (not me as my stomach was Full) to try their 5 Pc Dessert since it looked nice when they brought out for others! well, truly nobody liked any of the dessert except 1 person liked 1 of the dessert. I personally will not recommend the 5 pc dessert. 1 was Tirmasu cake-was ok.
1 was cheese cake-no no, 1 was Apple Crostada-no no, 1 Butter Cake -no-ok, creme brulee-ok-good.

{"text":"Everything was good and very well presented. Service was top notch. All food tasted like I was in Italy and the creme brûlée was also good, but when isn't it.  I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I cannot rave about this place enough. I only ever get to a Maggiano's on vacations. This time did not disappoint. We went with a party of 6 and had the family style experience. Chopped salad, crab cakes, and gnocchi with sausage to name a few dishes. Everything was perfect. Wait staff was pleasant. A violinist came to our table and even took some unusual requests. Great experience. A must try!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered takeout and my food was amazing as always! I felt the service was a little slow for the amount of people in the bar area where I had to pick-up my food. The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because as I was pulling up to park in one of the two open to go parking spaces a Office Depot truck pulled right in front of both spaces and parked. The man was delivering supplies to the restaurant. I told the hostess about my experience and it didn't seem like it was that big of a deal. If that happened at my business I would have made sure the driver moved his truck right away. You don't block the only two to go spaces for a really busy restaurant at lunch time no less."}
{"text":"Gotta' love these guys!!! They have good prices, great food, HUGE portions  and wonderful service!! If you are local park valet at the north valet and you will have a elevator that will bring you straight up the a beautiful hallway leading directly to the restaurant!!! MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"I am usually a fan but the service was very slow at this location.  The server was so rushed that I didn't order the salad that I wanted to add to my order, as well as order another drink.  The manager (I'm only assuming b/c of the shirt and tie) helped box my meal and bring a dessert menu but it still took 5-10 minutes to be able to order dessert and get my check.  The food was great but I'm looking for the whole package...call me picky!"}
{"text":"We were impressed with the ambiance and decor. The rooms were full if energy and the food was great! Our servers satisfied our every request."}
{"text":"This review is written with great disappointment and an empty stomach. After dinning here for several years with exceptional service and delicious food during nearly every visit, it is sad to say that Maggiano's- once one of the most decent and enjoyable Italian restaurants in the city- has become nothing more than another overpriced food chain who has surrendered standards of food quality for convenient, unsatisfactory practices that accommodate the new upscale-fast food pace of what was once a pleasant \"night out\" dinning experience. It is now Olive Garden with nicer decor and without the endless salad and bread sticks.

While the service from waiters and staff certainly still deserves praise and all five stars,the food, the main attraction, has lost all life, passion, and inspiration. 

The fried mozzarella appetizer, though having some flavor and edible, came warm rather than hot. Giving the impression the dish had been prepared ahead of time and kept warm. The dish was just hot enough for the cheese to stretch somewhat, rather than steaming hot with an extra crispy crust.

The Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was completely flavorless. The most basic of the culinary cooking herbs could have gone a long way. Alas, despite our best efforts, no amount of complimentary salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese could resuscitate the bland white sauce and under cooked noodles.

The eggplant parmesan, one of my long time favorite dishes, was apparently on holiday vacation with the rest of the country because it certainly didn't show up to our table. Bread crumbs and heavy amounts of acidic red sauce atop spaghetti noodles summarizes this dish. No flavor. No texture. No presentation. 

Of all the dishes brought to the table the mushroom ravioli and side spinach salad were the clear winners. Ample with flavor and reminiscent of what Maggiano's used to be. Unfortunately, this was not my order, and after three disappointments I did not feel compelled to change my order. Not even for the gnocchi with vodka sauce, another dish from the past I  have enjoyed, but could not bare to see fall short like the others.

Keeping in line with their excellent customer service, the chef did send home my original take home order of angel hair pasta and vegetables free of charge, despite the cancellation of my dine in order. While I am grateful for their gesture and commitment to patron satisfaction , sadly, the mushy noodles, catatonic sauce and vegetables did not amend for the very disappointing evening. 

Perhaps it was the busyness of a Saturday night that threw a large lug into the evening's fare. Whatever the case I hope Maggiano's can recover quickly and reverse it's current decent into corporate dining mediocrity."}
{"text":"We got the stuffed mushrooms which were delicious and the shrimp scampi which is a huge portion and also very yummy had lots of flavor . And we got one of their flatbreads I believe the chicken red pepper flat bread which was also very good ."}
{"text":"Excellent caprese salad. Quiet atmosphere. I didn't love the 'souvenir photo' gimmick, but the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Decent food, sub-par service. Our server was obnoxious,  we ordered a la carte and the serving sizes were quite small. I would not return, although family style is nice the price was rediculous for the quality of the food. Good ambiance, nice location."}
{"text":"It was my husbands birthday and I booked a table late in the day but for 5pm since he was catching a flight that night. We had a lovely table outside and since it was our first time they brought us fried ravioli with sauce, it was really good. The kids loved their cheese ravioli. We started with Steamed Mussels Tuscan Style,  I had the Grilled Salmon Lemon & herb with orzo & spinach for my main, hubby had the Veal Marsala and both were excellent! We had Tiramisu for dessert and it was wonderful. The service was outstanding! This was our first time here but will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"WARNING DO NOT EVER HAVE YOUR PRIVATE EVENT HERE! Completely Disappointed! Booked my second private event 8 weeks ago. The event was last night. Apparently 32 locals weren't priority enough so we were stuffed upstairs in a space that was maybe 15x15 with a makeshift curtain to divide the room. My event was our 20 yr anniversary party which was a painting party where while painting we were all going to order food individually. These painting parties are done all over town like this and food can always be ordered. NOT! They had us crammed like sardines with 8 at a table so our drinks wouldn't even fit on the table with all the canvases. Thank God we didn't have a server most of the night he wouldn't have had a place to set the drinks anyway. Multiple people complained through our 2 hour party that they never received refills or another drink or that they were hungry and couldn't order. Yes when I first booked this party 8 weeks ago I was told guests would be able to order food. I again confirmed this 2 days before the party.They also knew I was bringing a 20 yr anniversary/wedding cake. The server that brought the appetizers I ordered in advance complained about the cake in his way of where he was putting the appetizers. Really! Again I booked this event 8 weeks ago and they knew a cake was coming. Also everyone stood and held their plates to eat the appetizers since there was no place on the tables to put them. With no service I actually had to find a knife to cut the cake and plates for the cake behind 3 server cubbies in the restaurant. We had one server that had tables down stairs too. How can a server have tables downstairs and 32 people upstairs. The greatest part was that it was so incredibly hot in the upstairs corner they stuffed us in that my 3 tier cake began to melt and sag on one side. I was so disappointed in the lack of service and general feeling that we we were not important and not wanted. Thanks Maggianos no more private events at your place of business."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Maggiano's. Rigitoni D is the best! I was surprised however this one wasn't crowded on a Sunday evening. The food was wonderful. The waiter did make us feel a bit rushed when ordering but accommodated our children very well."}
{"text":"Vanessa was an amazing server! She picked up the slack from our original server who was very busy with a large party of people. So, it was completely understandable. She made me and my friend feel very comfortable had great suggestions and was Fantastic! I had their beef tenderloin and it was deeeelicious! Also, great great tiramisu!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! This review is for the service. Our waiter was slow,  and served other tables promptly that were seated after us. Apparently having a reservation means absolutely nothing at this place. Probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Maggiano's on the strip, and happy there's one closer to me. The Summerlin location is just as good if not better than the Strip location. Always great food and top notch service."}
{"text":"We're still talking about the bread 2 days later!  My pal's four cheese ravioli was amazing - swimming in a sea of creamy but light pesto sauce with a beautiful ribbon of marinara on top. My chicken saltimbocca was delicious! Home made fettuccine, delectable chicken meatballs with broad range of flavor, and a fabulous pesto sauce (very different from the ravioli). Our waiter was perfect- attentive while allowing us space to enjoy the meal. The venue had cool decor, but the wide open space was rather loud."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal.  Our waiter was perfectly pleasant, witty, and attentive.  The food was incredibly delicious, and the pricing was very reasonable.  Be prepared for a considerable wait without reservations, but I would highly recommend for anyone visiting the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Maggiano's! The food is excellent and the service is always on point. My Dad and I enjoy sitting at the bar and having lunch on occasion and we always leave extremely satisfied. All of the bartenders and wait staff are very personable and fun to talk to while we are eating our meal. Calvin and all of the other bartenders always provide great service and are very knowledgable of the menu and wine selection. I'm a big sports fan so I enjoy talking to Calvin about all the latest sporting events. Calvin and others always make our trip to Maggiano's a 5 star experience. The menu has something for everybody and has great lunch specials, a great happy hour and the Marco's meal for dinner is a definite go-to for anyone that loves delicious pasta. I can honestly say that I always look forward to a trip to Maggiano's. It's one of my top 5 favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First of all, we went during restaurant week and we realized that it would be busy. We made reservations at 7:15 and was not seated till 8:00. Then it just went downhill from there. Waitress was nice but slow. We ordered our meal which was the entree for 2. Ask for some bread and was not brought until after the appetizer came. From what I saw our waitress only had 3 tables. We had to keep asking for our drinks to be refilled. After about 45 minutes after placing our order she informs us that the chef lost our order because the printer stopped working. After another 30 minutes our entrees arrived but was disappointed in them. My wife was told the vegetable primivara had a white sauce but ther no sauce at all on it. The other entries looked and tasted like they were thrown in a microwave and warmed up. There were larger parties seated around us 30 minutes after we were and had already eaten and left. The manager came to our table after the waitress had seen my wife was eating her entree. We told him our grievances and he ask what could they do. I said how about desserts for everyone and after another 30 minutes, they were brought to table. He also said he would take care of everything, but was not sure what he was talking about, so we assumed that our meal was going to be comped but that was not the case. Our bills came to table mixed up. Only bight side was our 72 dollar bill was reduced to 26 and changed. Also looking at the decor in the restaurant, and noticed how many light bulbs in the lights were burned out and how DIRTY they areas around the air vents were. Hate to think that dirty air was falling onto customers plates. Was looking for a wonder evening with friends but was badly disappointed. Will not be back and will steer others away from  Maggianos. We arrived at 7:13 and did not leave till 10:30."}
{"text":"Quick tips for my Yelp friends, ask for the today and tomorrow special and you will receive an entree for today and one to go which is awesome. I've always liked the food here big portions reasonable price you're looking for a place to take your family and have a good Italian food Maggiano's just the place to be so I give this place 5 stars because that's what they are in my book."}
{"text":"Reservation Experience: I was deeply disappointed with my reservation experience. I called to reserve a table for a party of 10. It was a B-day dinner for my friend from NYC. I was told that the restaurant was limiting the amount of ppl per reservation to 7 ppl max. In my shock I asked \"well what times do you have?\" The girl on the phone said we are pretty open from 6:30 on... So does this make sense? - you're not booked but you're limiting groups to no more than 7. 

Essentially turning customers away.  

I recently relocated here to Charlotte from NYC I have been to Maggiano's several times AND LOVED IT and even celebrated my birthday there this past July. 

I was devastated and quite embarrassed to have to tell my friends that I was not able to get a table to accommodate us. 

So sad Maggiano's There was no flexibility .  Turning away customers & you're not even booked."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

I have been here twice and both times have been a very pleasant experience. The staff is wonderful and the food is CRAZY GOOD!

We have sat inside the restaurant and outside and both areas are very nice. We have bought several gift cards for friends and family so they can experience this great food as well."}
{"text":"Overrated and pricey.  Food is ok but much too salty.  Bad if you have high blood pressure.  Salad is great though.  Get a window seat if possible."}
{"text":"Had a group of 24, which is big even in Vegas. Treated us very well, fairly fast service and the portions were HUGE. Could not believe that if you finished a dish, they would keep bringing more out. All you can eat with a restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"i was recently at this restraunt for a birthday gathering superbowl sunday!  and oh my goodness was it delish!  the waiter nick was so helpful (and nice to look at btw)  he really tended to us as we had a lot of people!  i will be goin here again!"}
{"text":"I am Sicilian Italian brought up on  my grandmother's home made Italian food so I am pretty critical about Italian food. It tasted very authentic! I was impressed! The only things I would improve upon was that we had a reservation and still had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated, which being the restaurant is probably always so busy due to their great food, I could overlook this. The hostess area could use a little improvement, no one thanked us or told us to enjoy our night as we were leaving, nor greeted us on our way in,  the downstairs was very crowded with tables, it was very hard for the girl who seated us to navigate us to a table. Other then the two minor things I was very impressed. We will return if not for the restaurant experience, for sure for the take out. It was very reasonably priced. The classic pasta dishes are select one to eat there, and select another to take home. So basically buy one get one free for $13-16. I got eggplant parmigiana but there were quite a few of the classic pasta dishes to select from, not to mention all the other great items on the menu."}
{"text":"The chocolate cake was amazing. I would give the food 3.5 , great atmosphere though. Maybe I will try a different dish next time and see if that is better. I don't remember what I ate because it was that mediocre but the cake has been on my mind."}
{"text":"I decided to swing over here during lunch during a conference going on at the Wynn. I needed a break from the \"action\" of the conference and wanted to be able to sit down and enjoy myself and my meal. I headed over across the street from the Wynn to Maggiano's. I was promptly greeted and seated.

There's a Maggiano's in the Bay Area in CA so I was expecting the same level of food given it's a chain restaurant. They did not disappoint. The food was excellent. On top of that, the staff was extremely courtesy and friendly. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Family style is the best!  We had dinner at Maggiano's last night and no one left hungry!  We had a party of 5.  I suggested Family style so we could taste an array of dishes.  Family style includes: 1 salad, 1 app, 2 pastas, 2 meats, 2 desserts (and you can reorder!!) They were all good but I did have a favorite dish (chicken and spinach manicotti) and their Tiramisui and Creme Burlee were top notch! Our waitress was great and met all of our needs and requests with no qualms."}
{"text":"My first impression of Maggiano's was in Bellevue, WA. wow that was a nice place. Wait staff was professional , quick, plentiful, etc, and it just seemed like a place that was a little better than most nice places. Never had to wait more than 3-5 mins for anything or anyone there. 

The staff at the Scottdale M's was fine, but the whole vibe there was \"we're going to do just a little better than Olive Garden\". The food was good, but not excellent.  The 'killer' was the 'ol' \"would you like some parmesian cheese?

Bellevue location - waiter came out with a cheese grater and block of cheese immediately after we received our dishes and scraped away as long as we wanted.

Scottsdale location - had to ASK for it.  When it came, the waiter just slapped one of those glass shaker thingys with the parmesian cheese, which pretty much validated our opinion of the place.

Oh well, I probably won't go back - it's still better then Olive Garden, but just by a little bit.

Oh, one more thing, we ordered our stuff off this particular section of the menu and were given a choice of 2 more dishes to take home in to go containers. Kinda shows they're more into quantity of food rather than quality."}
{"text":"Great service...family friendly...try the chicken marsala...its off the chain...my lil ones were getting cranky waiting for food so they brought out snacks for them.outdoor dining great for people watching"}
{"text":"We have had good experiences here and not so great ones...it is, after all a chain restaurant and lacks the personalization we prefer. The lasagna is the highlight of the menu. I am not a huge lasagna fan so I often find myself trying some type of seafood dish, which I have found they over-sauce. The service was decent but we prefer to pick up here rather than dine-in, as it has a stuffy feel to the atmosphere. 

Pros: Good take-out, yummy lasagna

Cons: Ambiance, seafood dishes"}
{"text":"I drove 25 minutes for two chopped salads because I really love them. Drove 25 minutes back home w my take out order. Got home. It was not correct. So I called the manager on my way back. I was ANGRY. he offered a free dessert. Lame but better than nothing. Driving home and they didn't even put bread it there. Food is good but service is so lousy. In house or take out. Maybe that is why they are closing in a few weeks.  Still so angry"}
{"text":"The executive chef here is a lying acehole. Ps. They have a severe cock roach problem. The health department hides this. I use to work here. Stay away"}
{"text":"We just attended a party on the patio at Maggiano's over the weekend and it was amazing!!
The service was absolutely  on point with food, drinks and any question u wanted to ask. It was outstanding how they made the guest of honor feel special on her graduation day from UNLV. That was customer service at its best. I loved the views from the patio of the strip, the appetizers and food were delicious! It was a comfortable setting and a great place to celebrate! Hats off the the servers that evening!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Maggiano's thrice so far(different locations) and it has always been an amazing experience. The food and the service are great!!
Michelle (in AZ) has been really kind in suggesting some wonderful dishes. The Crème brûlée stole the show!"}
{"text":"When we feel like average Italian food we come to Maggianos.  It's a nice atmosphere and the food is decent. I don't really understand their promotion that gives you a free dish to bring home, but I know most people like free anything.  Our only complaint is that our waiter knew nothing about wine and took multiple tries to bring out the bottle we ordered."}
{"text":"First of all the atmosphere reminds me of a huge empty or abandoned Italian office building. The service was mediocre and the food is the Walmart of Italy. Bland and says it's one dish, but does not even come close to the real thing. Very tight seating luckily my friends and I are small to average. Tables are crammed together where the person behind you has to bump your chair just to get out if their seat. I would not recommend this establishment if you are looking for a real Italian family dinning experience. If you are on a tight budget this could be very hard to swing. Three of us together had a ticket price of $122.26 with no dessert or wine."}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken Caprese Salad was amazing! But, two of my family members were not as pleased as I was with their meals."}
{"text":"First time there I had a great dining experience. Friendly customer service. The food taste great. If you're into spicy shrimp and pasta the Shrimp far diavolo plate is the way to go."}
{"text":"Very accommodating for dietary restrictions i.e. gluten free, vegan. I called in advance before to see what they had on the menu that had no animal products. To my surprise the girl said \"So you mean Vegan items or entrees?\" I told her that was correct. She asked if I could be put on a brief hold to talk with the chef. After talking with the Chef she mentioned what items would work for us and also said that some items can be modified to fit our dietary needs. Another thing she mentioned is that when we arrive they will have a Chef come out to discuss our order. So we made a reservation for a party of 8(only 2 of us are vegan) 

We were greeted with a smile and seated right away. Our waiter came to take drink orders and to explain the menus as well. Afterwards he asked who will the Chef be talking to about vegan options and was guided towards us. He told me that he will have the chef come out.  

A few minutes pass by and then a young man came out to help us order. He guided us through the menu and recommended items or any type of modifications that we may like. It felt like we were getting a customize meal for the two of us which was very delightful. Him and the waiter even went to the extent of letting us know that the bread rolls they serve during service is dairy free and no eggs but is made on surfaces that may previously had a product that did contain those items. It reminded me of when I read labels during my grocery shopping.

Overall feel was great for the fact that we didn't feel judge on our lifestyle choice which we do sometimes receive when we ask all the usual questions when we go to a restaurant.

Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food. My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times and the first experience was wonderful. As we started coming back the experience and service completely went down. I was almost ready to say forget this place, but then Stephanie B has changed my view entirely. Her service and attention to detail was impeccable. If you visit this restaurant request her and her only. Stephanie B is the server you want."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was delicious plus extra food to take home. We both enjoyed this beautiful  restaurant.

{"text":"I hosted my husband's surprise party last evening at Maggiano's and it couldn't have been more perfect. Hector and the rest of the staff working the party were amazing, accommodating and made the guests feel comfortable and welcome. The food quality was great and plentiful and all guests left with very full bellies. The drinks were certainly flowing and the team was just really dedicated to ensuring that I was taken care of as the hostess and my guests were having fun. Liane and the banquet staff were accommodating and proactive about making sure we had the little extras (and no, not nickel and diming me) to make the party very special. They even proactively moved us to a beautiful private room the day before the party because it wasn't being used, at no extra charge. The value for what I paid for food and drink was definitely there and we even kept the party going an additional hour because everyone was having so much fun - all the while Hector and team were taking care of our every need.

Well done Maggiano's- thanks for making my husband's birthday a memorable evening!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time last night about 8:45 pm. I had been wanting to try this place out for awhile and decided to go there on my birthday with my family for a late dinner. Now i just wish i had never tried it.  I ordered the 2 meals for 13.99. I tried the spaghetti marinara for the meal there and the vegetable Primavera to take home. The spaghetti had no flavor whatsoever, it was so bland. I also ordered the maggiano's side salad.  It looked like bagged lettuce. The taste was just okay, but defintely not worth 6.95. I really expected better for the price, and that goes for everthing. Then the next day when i tried the vegetable primavara, it was awful, the sauce was bland and the veggies were hard and undercooked. I couldn't even eat more than a couple bites. So disappointing! I would never have thought that a place so busy would have this awful of food.  We eat regularly at CPK next door and always see this place busy so that's why i wanted to try it. For my family this mistake cost us $75.26 plus a generous tip for our server who was very nice. But almost $90 for a suppar meal? And on a special occasion no less. Never again."}
{"text":"My wife & I LOVE Maggiano's. Everything is fresh made. They always have a great selection of specials in addition to their regular, awesome menu. What's is awesome is that if you order one of their Signature dishes, you get one to take home for FREE! You have to try their crab cakes! A-ma-zing. We also enjoy they stuffed mushrooms. I love their seasonal special of Butternut Squash Ravioli. Whether you are looking for a place for a great date, a place from the family and kids or a private party, I would say Maggiano's all the way!"}
{"text":"Great food and Always excellent service. Generous portions. Unfortunately always busy and sometimes long wait without reservation. Great food, mediocre wine, and good desserts. Always taken care of there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant the waiters and waitresses really treat you like family! 

For appetizers we ordered the chicken roasted pepper flat bread- it was amazing! Couldn't get enough! We also split a large Cesar salad because who can get enough?!

For entrees we got the famous rigatoni pasta it was amazing as well! I couldnt finish it all so I got a box to go, my significant other got the chicken and spinach pasta, it was amazing as well, he's ordered it before and is always pleased! We also got 2 pastas to take home & a delicious slice of rich chocolate cake! All for 70 dollars!! That might seem high to some but for us, for all the food we were very pleased! And our waiter, Erick, was superb! We will be back in the near future! Probably a day when we're starving & looking to be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Asian man, manager I presume very hostile would not return due to his tone with me and my guests tonight."}
{"text":"Quick Tip: Great Italian food :) has a small banquet room in the back, too.

A friend of mine recently got married and had his reception here. We came in through the back of the restaurant and I was amazed at how beautiful it looked. The hallways were decorated with vintage looking furniture, and the reception hall itself was beautiful. It had a big windown that you can see part of the Las Vegas strip from. Lots of light.

The dinner was sit-down buffet style. We had three courses: Appetizer, Main course and dessert. The food was awesome, most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes! This was a special Italian restaurant and I was so happy to be able to try all their food.

The salad was excellent: fresh lettuce, blue cheese and dressing. There were two types, but I didn't get to taste the other one. The calamari was really good, too.

The cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table. Something so simple was so delicious, and felt so light in your mouth. There was chicken florentine, a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian. I heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course, but i couldn't sample it. Guess why? :P

The dessert was cheesecake with strawberries, as well as a fruit plate with pineapples, honeydew, cantaloupes, grapes, strawberries, watermelons. Fresh. everything just tasted so fresh.

The best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance. There is a full bar, and it looked like really efficient servers. They were all polite, too. 

This is a place to definitely check out if you aren't interested in buffets, or just want to sample a different type of life with Vegas. Definitely a great atmosphere, with great food...and even better with great friends and family."}
{"text":"Great place for a delicious dinner (and chocolate dessert)! Our waiter Ken was excellent, very attentive to details! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Annoying waiter. I don't usually like to chit-chat with anyone while having a piece of meat in my mouth (like ever.. in any possible scenario!) So yeah... restaurants are not exempted from that. Just let me eat, suck, chew at peace, will ya?"}
{"text":"Place- Nice, spacious great place for a meal. They have private rooms in the back. Clean and bright. They have outside seating. 

Menu- The lunch specials are not bad. The dinner menu was pretty big. I saw the portions for dinner and they were huge. We ordered the stuff mushrooms as an appetizer and they came to our table in 5 minutes. A little too fast if you ask me. I hope they were not sitting under a heat lamp. Fettuccine in lobster sauce was pretty good. Chicken picatte fed two people just fine. The creamy chicken and potato soup was awesome. Next time, I will order a bowl. 

Service - The service was good. Our waiter, however, wouldn't shut up. Don't you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just  go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation. It was comment after comment. I could not really enjoy the  time with my friends. At first I felt bad but then I realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends. Especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed \" need some help miss\"? My friend politely said \"no thank you\". While I was thinking in my head \"WHAT A PERVERT\". To be honest, he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets. 

Minus one star for the server that wouldn't shut up."}
{"text":"I love ! Maggianos Little Italy.  The location at Downtown Summerlin is beautiful, clean, convenient parking, and friendly staff.  The weekend brunch is so nice.  They also have a deal where you can get pasta to take home with you, talk about a good deal!!!  The butter cake dessert is the best butter cake of all time.  It's a nice place for date lunch or date night and you can get a reservation on OpenTable.  Thank you for coming to Downtown Summerlin!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  We were here for two Saturdays (first Saturday about 11 people and 2nd Saturday 8 people) both times we did not get our food for almost 2 hours.  Our group was not the only one had the issue, we can see other parties complaining and yelling to the manager for the poor service,  but not all experience was bad though because the manager apologized for the issue, gave us a 100 dollar gift card and said our food are also free of charge.  I can't imagine how many parties they had to comp.

The food are good unfortunately the service are terrible when it comes to big parties.

It's not bad if you go on a small group but I would not recommend a party of more than 4 people, clearly they don't know how to handle large parties."}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's for the first time today for brunch and had an amazinggggg experience. Our waiter JD was probably one of the best servers I've ever had at any restirant!! He was so fun and awesome and made our experience so awesome. The food and drinks were outstanding. When we asked for to go boxes and he not only packed up everything for us but he also put the whipped cream and berries that was included with my meal on ice in it's own separate container and I just thought that was so thoughtful. I will definitely be coming back not only for the food, but for the service as well :)"}
{"text":"Come hungry! Very good \"family style\" Italian eating. I leave stuffed every time."}
{"text":"Four stars for ambience, offerings, and class of service. We enjoyed our dinners and everything was very tasty. From the eggplant parm to the frutti de mare. Quite satisfied although I think next time we will go family style."}
{"text":"Our first and last time

We have a Maggiano's at home in Scottsdale but I've never been there. It was our first time and also last time.

The location and decor are great. 

Our waiter was friendly until we said we do not drink alcohol. He tried to push some fish special but I wanted the carbonara. Because I just love a good carbonara. It's my right ;) Well, this one was not good at all. There was lots of cream (cream in Carbonara??? which by the way was not described on the menu), the pieces of bacon were huge and greasy, the poached egg on the top was overcooked (as in the yolk was not runny).

My husband meatballs were not cooked through and his pasta dish overall was very heavy.

The waiter insisted that all was made from scratch but he delivered our dish so fast that I can't believe that. 

Bottom line: Maggiano will never ever see us again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Nothing fancy but the food never disappoints!  I always start with the chopped salad.  This is a classic...so good!  My all-time favorite entree is the eggplant parmigiana.  The flavor and texture is amazing.  No one has been able to top the eggplant parmigiana at Maggiano's!   Love how they give you another one \"to-go\" so you can have \"leftovers the next day.   Save room for desert...Apple crostado, tiramisu or lemon cookies are all amazing."}
{"text":"Very nice, old time atmosphere, great service, had wonderful deep fried Zucchini strips for an appetizer then enjoyed a generous portion of Linguine di Mare 
Lobster, Shrimp, Mussels, Clams & Spicy Tomato Sauce, ate until I was full and still had half left for later. Will gladly return."}
{"text":"The food was less then inspiring.  I was in a rush and wanted to grab something to eat for the family so I got some traditional dishes, chicken Marsala, Caesar salad, and spaghetti and meatballs.  They we all less then what I expected and not worth what I spent.  The biggest disappointment was the Caesar salad.  The lettuce was brown.  That's just a lack of effort more than anything else."}
{"text":"So my bf and I decided to eat here while we were at the fashion show mall. He kept raving to me how good it was so I wanted to try it. And he was RIGHT!! It is absolutely delicious. It's fine dining so of course service was great as well."}
{"text":"Customer service was fantastic, meals mediocre, and and selection OK. We went during restaurant week and I was surprised that the entree selection was so small. I order some kind of pasta with mushrooms. The mushrooms were so thick and dry I couldn't eat them. We ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer and boy... some of those tentacles didn't even have breading on them! I was disgusted and couldn't eat them all. I probably will not return unless I'm out of other options in a rush."}
{"text":"My entire family has been going to Maggiano's for many, many years.  This last meal on Fathers Day was unfortunately the last.  The food and service was very good as usual.   However, the booth next to us was occupied by 3 adults and two DOGS.  IN THE RESTAURANT.  And no, they were not service dogs.  When I asked one of the managers why dogs were allowed to sit up at the table with people I was told that people can bring in dogs for \"emotional support\".   WHAT???? If you need your dog to provide \"emotional support \" in order for you to get through a meal at a restaurant then you either need to stay home or get some professional help.  Or both.  I was told that these people have a right to bring the animals in the restaurant and Maggianos cannot stop them.  What if my son had an allergic reaction to these animals???  What if a dog bit someone??? Where are my rights to eat at a restaurant without dog hair landing in my food????   I am flabbergasted that a nice restaurant like this would allow such behavior and will never patronize them again.   Maggiano's, you need to re evaluate this unsafe and unhygienic policy."}
{"text":"Was here tonight for a friend's birthday. We were 9 people. The food is always great, which makes it enjoyable every time but I was so impressed with the service we received. Marcus, the manager, made sure we were taken care of. Awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Maggiano's across the country.  I live in Summerlin and was excited when they opened in Summerlin.  Much to my disappointment this Maggiano's is just not up to par.  We have given it 2 opportunities to shine.  Neither of our trips were during a prime hours, holidays or special events.  We went on Sunday night both times. The food and service are just not what I expect from Maggiano's.  We drove to the downtown location last night instead of heading to the Summerlin location which is 2 minutes from my home."}
{"text":"First time going and we will definitely go back. Fantastic food. Very busy and service was still great. Managers were helping clear tables to keep things moving everyone was very attentive and polite. We set up reservation online for 730pm. Got there at 720 and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time. Kudos to the team work by staff and the ability work manage a crowd."}
{"text":"Tony B-

I just want to set the record straight.  Maggiano's is owned by a private company that was started in 1991 which also owns On the Border, Macaroni Grill, and Chili's. Maggiano's Restaurant has had the same owner since 1996. There has been no ownership change. If you had a bad experience, Maggiano's thrive's on customer satisfaction and will make sure that your next experience is a happy and memorable one. Thanks and don't forget to mention this article and mention the banquet sales department when you return!!

{"text":"We invited guests from out of state to experience Maggiano's. We 
dined at the Scottsdale location and were not disappointed.

The Chef, Javier came to our table to make sure that our food was prepared
and listened to comments about the meal in a very positive, professional
manner. Our waiter, Sule was excellent and very attentive and made sure that 
we had everything we needed to complete our meal. The manager that evening 
was Dan Ferguson, who represented this restaurant as if it was his own. If
there was any issue, he made sure that everything was taken care of in a
timely manner.

Needless to say, our out of town guests were very much impressed with
not only the great customer service, but the wonderful employees that
make guests feel very welcomed. 

We definitely will return and look forward to another great meal!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that seems like it is locally owned, even though it is not. The decor is very classy, complete with dim lighting, classic looking menu boards on the walls -- the works. 

We had a very short wait (maybe 5-10 minutes) and the food was great. Even my husband, who isn't normally a Maggiano's fan, liked his salad. We had the flatbread pizza appetizer as well, which was delicious. 

This Maggiano's is attached to Beachwood Place, so there is plenty of parking, but they also have valet parking available. 

My only complaint was while our waiter was friendly and polite, he seemed very distracted and we had to ask him several times for simple things like napkins, the check, etc. 

Overall, Maggiano's is a great choice for a semi-fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Although this is located right off of Las Vegas Blvd. it's a place missed by many people. Great Italian food and the service that I've had there is been impeccable. The place is much larger than it looks when you first come in. There is an entire series of banquet halls in the back for private events.

I overheard what looked like one of the banquet managers talking to the team that was getting ready for a reception. They seem very organized and caring about the event."}
{"text":"Italian is not always my favorite because it typically involves a lot of carbs..  I am best staying away from it.  Of course I always manage to order anything but pasta so I am probably missing the best part.

I've been here a few times and never been there without a 30 min wait.  Nevertheless I enjoyed the service and the food each time I've been there.  It's not cheap but you will for sure leave with a very full stomach. 

Personally I find the musicians performance somewhat annoying.  Maybe because I have always come here with a group and it's hard to have a conversation with that in the background.  I am not sure if I was on a honeymoon I would like it either.  Just not working for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's perfect for a date or even if you want to have a nice dinner with family. They play really nice music like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and the overall ambiance is perfect. Oh! And the food is delicious. I have gone several times but most recently Hailey was my hostess and Martin was our server. They gave great service. It was my boyfriends birthday and Hailey was so nice and courteous when she made my reservation. Martin was very attentive to our table and helped us chose which good wine. Great place to eat! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.

On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"2nd visit. This time for Easter lunch. Again we had reservations and were seated on time. Super friendly staff. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The Chef's special was outstanding. In fact all of the food was out of this world. Really looking forward to coming back. Either a first date, an anniversary or just a regular day... This is where you want to go!"}
{"text":"I been wanting to go here for many reasons, specifically because friends of mine told me it was a great place to eat at, it's very neat, and I was seated fast, but I personally think the food was average.  Nothing spectacular, but it was ok. I just ordered a Cesar salad and zitti."}
{"text":"Yummy family spot.  Great meatballs.  My husband had Veal Marsala and the sauce was great, although meat was a bit tough.  Great Mule cocktail.  The best is they accept reservations.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Love , love , lovvveee the foood . I would eat there everyday if I could ! Everything is made from scratch no presevatives , no frozen food. Tastes awesome :) I had the beef tenderloin with a side of mash potatoes and Asparagus, and the spinach artichoke appetizer to start with. Couldnt finish off with desert this time \" way too full \" but Ive had the Tiramisu in the past and its devine !"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our birthday (it was both of our birthdays-yes same day)celebration dinner on a Tuesday night.  We started off at the bar for a quick drink before our reservation at 7:15pm began, then we were seated at a booth in the back.  We had to wait over 20 minutes for our server to finally come over for the first time. Then when he did make his way over his first words were to ask if we were ready to order.  In all of that time we were only poured a water.  Then once we ordered we had to wait almost another 20 minutes for our side salads.  Mind you that it was a Tuesday night and they were slow, also we let them know ahead of time that we were celebrating our birthdays and not one person recognized this or even made any attempt to.  The food was good as it always is, however, the service was terrible.  Especially when we were out celebrating.  Very disappointed.  Do not know if I will go back to this restaurant again.  For the money you pay for a pasta or chicken entrée the service should be outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  You get an awful lot of food for a great price.  The quality is good too."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First time there was a date night with husband and since we have a new baby it doesnt happen very often. Food was amazing, service was fast and the manager gave us a free dessert in celebration of the special night. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times now and to me the food is just Ok. Nothing great. Our server was great and has been everytime so that is a plus. I ordered one of there drink specials and it was amazing. It was a st. Patrick long Island. I wanted to keep drinking those!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.... Ok, Maggiano's is pretty weak in food and flavor. I suspected that coming in but insisted to myself and gf that it'd be different. 

For me, spinach dip is like cheesecake or tiramisu to others...I have to try it everywhere I go. It's good here, but that's where it ends. The pastas, while I've only eaten a few of them, are pedestrian at best, and because of that are overwhelmed with super rich sauces and condiments...not allowed to stand on their own. 

But then again, this isn't a place famous for it's authentic Italian cuisine, or properly prepared pastas and other fare. It is well known, I believe, for it's family style offerings, so that's probably the key. Bring a bunch of your friends and family and spend two hours eating and making small talk, then spend two hours wondering what just happened, and of course recollecting the experience at reunions whilst drinking and apologizing... and blushing."}
{"text":"The purpose of our visit to Maggiano's was to carb-load the night before the Las Vegas marathon (which two of our party were actually running, the other two were there to support the runners.  And the carb loading!).  We were looking for somewhere close to Treasure Island at a reasonable price, and Maggiano's fit the bill. We made reservations through Open Table and were seated at our scheduled time.

The inside of the restaurant was quite nice but the tables are soooooo close together, I kept bumping into the guy behind me.  There was a large party of obnoxious loud people, but this tends to be the case at a lot of places in Vegas.  We split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and while it was delicious, for the price I was expecting a bit more.  However, they made up for portion sizes with the entrees!  My eggplant parmesam was posetively massive, but still elegantly served which I appreciated.  Another in our party had the chicken tortelloni's and the two others had the gnocchi.  Honestly, mine was pretty good but I liked everyone else's selections better.  Maybe I just chose something I wasn't in the mood for.

The bill was reasonable for Vegas and the meal served its primary purpose.  However, in comparison to alot of other places, it was just okay, and I wouldn't add it to my \"must visit while in Vegas\" list."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!! I cannot believe I haven't tried it sooner! I got the Shrimp with Orzo (special). It wasn't a lot but after I ate it I realized it was a perfect portion because I was able to get some Tiramisu which is soooo good. My fiance got the Four Cheese Ravioli, and I tried some. I have never known food to melt in your mouth, and besides that I hate a bunch of cheese together, but in this dish you can barely tell. The season and sauces where a GREAT blend. My fiance also got the New York Style Cheesecake, which was also delicious. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The lasagna was very good as well as the Caesar salad and French bread. I loved the Italian dessert"}
{"text":"I made reservations here for a first date before reading other reviews. And after reading other reviews I was concerned we wouldn't have good service. But that opposite actually happened. We had excellent service!!! Our waiter Jason was very attentive and courteous! The ambiance was pleasant. The environment a little noisy but for my girl and I it didn't bother us. We had a romantic time! After we ordered our food it was ready in 15 minutes and warm on the plate. The salmon was good, didn't care for the rice that came with it. My girlfriend got the chicken Parmesan and loved it. We shared the spumoni for desert and loved it. We forgot our coupon and receipt but will be back another time for sure."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment!  Waitress very nice, but kitchen must have a real problem.  It took over an hour for any food to arrive. While we waited, we did not get a water refill and had to call over a waiter and ask. Then, the salad actually arrived after the food. Both meals got the wrong pasta and the sausage & peppers only came with the sausage. ...no peppers. 
This is actually the 2nd time that the food took so long to arrive. Not motivated to return again."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive for a chain.  I always like this chain and have had good luck.  The Veal was a little dry, bit still was pretty good. The server was great and the Manager was very engaged with what was happening in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Highly suggest Maggiano's inside the Fashion Show mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Great quality Italian! Yummy appetizers & delicious meals like Momma would make!
Request a table with a view & you will love your visit even more! Friendly staff! Always go there when I'm in the mood for the best Italian food in Sin City! Great place to take a date or get family style dining with the friends or family!!"}
{"text":"1st time here and it was great. Food was fantastic. Well be here again. Next time we won't forget our gift card. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here last night and it was pretty good, better than what you would find in a real Italian restaurant. I had the Salmon Oscar (creamy with chunks of crab) with broccolini. I've never lemon-garlic broccoli. It was different. They need to do something about that hostess stand. It took me forever to find it because the large group in front of me was just waiting around, so I waited around."}
{"text":"I can't thank this wonderful place enough for providing my parents an incredible 50th wedding anniversary! Food, service, EVERYTHING was just amazing!"}
{"text":"My company caters from Maggiano's every year on our of our busiest days. This was my 1st year ordering for our department and they weren't able to find the order from last year as a reference. I tried to order what I thought was the same thing, but the bill came out to over $2,000 more than what we had paid last year. After seeing the amount, I called back and spoke to another person, who actually helped us last year. After a couple of minutes, he was able to find our order and confirm what was different about it. He was very helpful and we were able to get things taken care of.

As I said earlier, we have been catering with Maggiano's for years... at least the past 4 years since I have been with my company. This year, we catered in food for over 450 people and the delivery charge was over $700! I understand the delivery charge, but $700? We called a competitor when we were thinking about cancelling their order and they charged $50 per delivery, which is much more reasonable!  They have never offered us a discount or taken off the delivery charge, which is upsetting since we spend at least $6,000 a year. Based off of the service and cost for this year, we will not be returning next year for our event."}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience from start to finish. We enjoyed the weekend brunch and it was very impressive. Our server Robert was perfect and such a nice guy. The sausage frittata was delicious and they did not mind special requests."}
{"text":"Great value for consistently delicious food. We dinned here twice while in Vegas because of the Happy Hour and the quality of food. I had cheese raviolis one night and the pasta Primavera another night with an Italian house salad. Both dishes were flavorful, fresh and big enough to split. You must have the hazelnut cheese cake some of the proceeds go to the charity from the cake. The servers were great each time!"}
{"text":"Brought me my two to-go vegetable pennes with cheese all over them even though I was explicit that I can't eat cheese. This is whatever because restaurants do it all the time, but when I returned them, the next two they brought out had white gunk all over the inside of the to-go container lids... on both of them! I didn't notice till we had left because I assumed they got it right that time. And it looks gross, I don't understand how they did that or what happened but they obviously didn't care."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with three co-workers last Wednesday night (1/11/2012). The ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. We ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. We have the Mozzarella Marinara, Spinach & Artichoke al Forno, Garlic Bread Focaccia, and Italian Tossed salad. For dinner we ordered Gnocchi & Italian Sausage, Four-Cheese Ravioli, Baked Rigatoni Pomodoro, and Braised Beef Ravioli. The main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. I could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.

This restaurant is highly rated by many on Yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but I will find it hard to return after my last experience. I don't think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed."}
{"text":"We found maggiano's in Cali on our honeymoon and was so happy to find out they had one in Scottsdale! We love the stuffed pasta and the creme brûlée is a good size and tastes amazing! We have taken a couple different people on various occasions who have enjoyed it and will probably be returning to the Scottsdale location for our Anniversary (:"}
{"text":"Awful!!! Went in to see if they were on a wait for two, told it was going to be a 45 minute wait and was told that we could be served at the bar. Neither bartenders addressed us for a good fifteen minutes and when they did we were greeted with a \"can I help you?\" So we left in response to the rude greeting."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner before a concert at the Cosmo. Made reservations so we wouldn't have to wait. Seated immediately upon arrival, and by the window at that!

Great service. April was our server and she was awesome and on top of everything. 

Will definitely eat here again when I am in Vegas next."}
{"text":"Service was marginal , but the food was great. Bottom line : Service makes or breaks your dining experience , and today just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"A terrible representation and an insult to Italian cuisine!!
How dare your establishment the name of Italian food.

Disappointing taste and flavor, you can easily identify microwave in use.

Never again."}
{"text":"Ok.... I went in honestly with low expect just cause I don't care for Olive Garden or buca di peppa... gotta day the service was amazing from Johnny. We explained we'd never been here and even the chef came out to meet us and brought a couple pieces of fresh bruschetta. The ricotta balls are delish. We got the Marcos meal for 2 ... we had lasagna , ravioli BOTH were delish. For desert we had the butter cake.. oh and we had some of the lemon cookies complimentary ... the whole
Experience was nice. We def have our new Italian choice made now!!!!"}
{"text":"Today I had the chicken Francis salad and bread it was excellent and they delivered it to the hospital good stuff"}
{"text":"A summary and suggestion for virgin Maggiano's customers:

Summary
1.  Service was spectacular.  Our waiter refilled our water glasses several times and really knew his stuff.   It was my friend's birthday and she found some extra cookies our waiter had thrown in when she arrived home and unpacked her to go container.

2.  Food - um....delicious.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed.  The meatball was as big as my head and very tasty.

3.  Drinks - fantastic.  I had the red sangria (don't tell my Irish brethrin) which was delicious.

4.  Atmosphere:  Classic Italian.  It's no Maestros, but it's also no Olive Garden.  

Suggestion:
Get the $39.95 dinner for two if you go with someone.  You actually get one very large meal (which you probably won't be able to finish) AND a to go meal which you can freeze, feed to the dog, or whatever else you decide to do with it + desert + a side.  It's a great value.

Well played Maggianos...well played."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a party of eight to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I and everyone else in my party really enjoyed the experience.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the vegetable primavera with whole wheat penne pasta.  The vegetables were fresh and the homemade pasta was cooked to perfection.  Vanessa, our waitress, was friendly and attentive.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great family style Italian!  Host and wait staff is first class.  Food is excellent.  I have eaten here many times.  On the occasion they make a mistake, they are quick to rectify."}
{"text":"OK, I'm not sure what all the good reviews are for at this restaurant. The most important thing is the food, and this place does not have good food. Everything was just so bland. The atmosphere is really nice if you can get by it being attached to a mall. The service started out good until our server got more then two tables. Started out good with the olive oil and bread, but the flatbread app was to soggy and no taste. Special pasta sausage chicken was just so bland. No taste no flavor. The best part was the dessert, which was the cheesecake. Don't plan on going back, I can cook better Italian food at my house."}
{"text":"Great food, however this place doesn't build it's business off of customer service. If you have any special request forget about it. They don't have to worry about repeat customers in a location like this. Doesn't matter to them that you are spending a nice good amount of money to take your family out for a nice evening. We asked if we could sit on the patio... No, even tho plenty of tables. Can we sit by the window? (Vegas) if you want to wait 20-30 min... Again plenty of open tables. Guess what?? There's a lot of other great restaurants in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"4stars-1star
4stars for the food. I Love Maggiano's. Their baked four cheese raviolis in creamy pesto sauce could not be more ah-mazing.Buyer beware, the half order is more than enough to fill you up! And another fair warning: the mama's lasagna could probably feed a family of five. Ok, if you have a huge appetite, maybe a family of three.
1star for the server. The SERVICE was great. We were seated quickly, the food came out quickly, had a great table with a view of the outside of Fashion Show Mall. But our server really...screwed up? He asked us where we were from and we responded \"California\" and he proceeded to tell us what bad drivers we are...umm does he know we are the ones who tip him? Regardless us this gentleman's faux pas I still tipped him 20%. Hopefully he'll learn to keep his big mouth shut next time he gets one of us crazy Californian drivers."}
{"text":"A hit or miss experience.  Went there the other night and the older guys (managers?) running the host stand were very unpleasant.  When we told them our party WAS indeed all present, but just in the bathroom, they took another ten minutes to get us taken care of.  Then they scoffed when we asked where our waiter went fifteen minutes after taking our drink order.

The wait staff themselves are usually decent, to be honest.  But it's a little inconsistent.

If cheapness is your thing, come here.  After all, it's run by the wizards who brought you the authentic stylings of Chili's and On the Border (oh, sorry, most of the ladder here in Phoenix closed).  You can get a run-of-the-mill pasta and one to take home for $12.95.  I do enjoy the late night fridge raid of my second meal, but it's nothing I couldn't have spent ten minutes and made in my own pot.  The classics menu is a who's who of boring concoctions with no original take on them.

The atmosphere here is interesting and surprisingly void of a North Scottsdale vibe.  Problem is you never know exactly what you're going to get.  I'm not a huge fan of any chain Italian, but I'll take Carrabba's across the street; feels a bit more warm to me even if it's less hip, and the menu offers more excitement."}
{"text":"The moment we walked into this place, it was alllll bad! It breaks my heart to write this review because back home Maggiano's was one of my favorite restaurants. I've always thought this place had good food and that the prices were fair for the huge portions, so I was super excited to find one here in Arizona. BUT this location sucked and i'm  sad that i won't be returning. 

Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the manager who asked us how we were doing. My bf and I politely answer, then for a good 5 seconds there was complete silence. I look at him like dude, be normal and say \"just two?\" or \"how many?\" Instead he looks at me, makes this rude gesture with his head and has this look on his face like \"what do you want?\" So I'm like... \"uhhh.. table for two.\" Anyways, I try to ignore his rudeness.. but me and my bf were like wow.. what's this guy's deal? 

Anyways, after Mr. Incompetent seats us, the entire dining experience kept going down hill:

-Loss of 1 star: Dirty Dishes. I'm usually the kind of person who doesn't speak up when I'm unhappy with something at a restaurant, but as we were waiting for our food we noticed the small plates and the wine glasses were super dirty! I was pretty grossed out so I asked the waitress (without trying to be annoying) to take it off the table.

-Loss of 2 stars: Slow Service. I started to get really annoyed when it took forever to bring out our bread. I just drooled as I saw people who were seated after us munching away on their bread. We finally got the bread once our first entree came out which was ridiculous. They were also really slow with refilling our drinks. At one point, I just started chewing ice .

-Loss of 3 stars: Rude service. In addition to the dumb manager in the front, our waitress was a little biatch! My bf asked her if we could have more olive oil and balsamic vinegar and as he was speaking, she looked at him and walked away! Then she came back and said she would bring it out... as she walked away from our table the ladies sitting at the table next to us say \"well that was a nice eye roll\". I was like oh hell no, did she roll her eyes at us?! Then the ladies next to us started complaining about the service and said they had been waiting for their check for a while and they had no idea where their server was. 

-Loss of 4 stars: Smaller Portions. I always get the same thing back home; a salad and a chicken and spinach manicotti. When the manicotti came out, I was shocked! It was a lot smaller than usual! I usually think the dish is worth the $15, but this definitely was not worth the money. It looked like it was missing a big chunk!! I was sooooooo sad!


It was just a bad experience overall. In all the times I have been to a Maggiano's, I have never left with such negative feelings! I guess I'll have to wait till I go back home to have my chicken manicotti again :("}
{"text":"Good food!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Maggiano's, so I didn't know what to expect. We made reservations and were promptly seated. We waited for a guest who showed up a few minutes late, but our waiter was kind enough to check on us while we waited. 
Once our guest showed up, we ordered 2 appetizers;
 
fried calamari- soft and non chewy, seasoned well

fried eggplant- sliced thin, breaded and fried- double yummy'

salad- I don't remember what kind, but they were kind enough to substitute the gorgonzola cheese with mozarella.I had to ask them for more avocado, since there was only one piece in the whole salad. I think the waiter returned with a few more pieces (there must have been a shortage of avocados that day). Plus, the dressing was a little weak and I could barely taste it  (they must have been short on that too).

cream pasta with chicken dish- There was barely any sauce on this and what I did manage to get onto my pasta and fork, seemed to have a nice subtle taste to it. Would have been nice to be served pasta that glistened with sauce, instead of me looking and wondering if there was any on there to begin with. Instead of the slogan, \"where's the beef?\" the guestion of the day, should have been, \"where's the sauce?\"

Service- good
food- mediocre'
price- moderate


Our waiter mentioned that they'd soon be opening a Maggiano's in Hawaii, I hope by the time that they do, the quality of the food will improve.  Maybe I went on a off day, but I'm willing to give them a second chance.

Till next time, happy eating!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my recent visit to Maggiano's.  I was in the mood for just traditional pasta, so I ordered the Spaghetti with meatball.  It was delicious!  The place was really busy, so we decided to eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  The bar staff took great care of us.  They had a nice wine list and great cocktail selections.  It's also wonderful for families and the prices are not bad.  I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch! Since they have a scratch kitchen I asked for scramble eggs with chicken sausage add in and I had an order of pumpkin pancakes with a sangria!  Everything was delicious! Pancakes were light and fluffy!!"}
{"text":"I could not have been happier with my visit! It was the location my friend selected and it was amazing! There was not a single staff member that wasn't friendly and smiling but our waitress was the best! Cici took care of us from the start of our meal all the way to the end of our meal. She offered exceptional insight on the menu options, her conversations with us were light and fun, our glasses stayed full, and she surprised us with a small plate of treats at the end of our meal- sweet and decadent!
The food tasted great! It was hot and fresh! The ambiance was perfect for getting to know my date! It was the perfect balance of fine dining meets casual living! And the location made for a perfect opportunity to dine and walk the strip after dinner. I look forward to visiting again soon!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Happy Hour at Maggianos!  Service is prompt and friendly.  Deven, our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. Great evening. Fantastic music too!"}
{"text":"The food here is so mediocre. My husband had a steak that was rare when he specifically asked for well done. My sister had  raw salmon. You're only paying for the location because the food is so suspect."}
{"text":"First experience...was super excited.  Made a reservation as it was a Friday night (smart idea right).  Reservations don't matter here!  Disappointing to say the least.  We showed up 30 minutes early, and were told \"we are running about 15 minutes behind on reservations...ok.  We understand that things can run behind.  We patiently waiting....at 7:15 we asked the hostess how long...my answer was \"we are still sitting the 6:45 people, then it will be your turn.\"  Again as we are all starving, we continue to wait.  This food better be amazing...I'm ready to leave and go grab a burger.  Finally sat at about 730.  Started with fresh bread which was delicious!  The balsamic and oil was delish as well. There were 4 of us so we decided to do the family style dinner (or whatever it's called).  The antipasto was amazing...boratta was delicious!!!  The food and service once sat was great.  Make sure I are hungry-it's a ton of food!  Best this was the butter cake...AMAZING!!!!  We will be back, just not on a weekend"}
{"text":"We went to Maggiano's for a family celebration and were pleased with the quality of food and service. We got the buy one entree and take another home deal, that includes appetizer and dessert of your choice. It was great value for $$. The place is spacious and ambiance is wholesome, if that makes sense."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for my anniversary 3 years strong! 
This is an amazing restaurant and totally worth every penny. It has an amazing view on the strip. The service is incredible. I love the homemade bread; it tastes like heaven. I recommend the chicken parm. It comes with a side spaghetti. The calamari is a must, too!! I'm almost positive that if you come here, you'll really enjoy it. Bring someone special."}
{"text":"The best service! 

We came in for our first visit, dressed like we were from the gym. We were treated with the best respect, the waiter Albert was magnificent. Suggested meals to accompany our wine selection. Very informative. Very nice. With so many choices in the area and lack of service, Maggianos has earned me as a repeat customer. The food also was PERFECT which is also another reason. Great job by the whole crew."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Mostly its been good. But, There is only one good thing I can say about my experience with Maggiano's this last time. The Waitress was great. She was on the ball all night.

But, The meal was horrible. I could not believe how bad it was. It wasn't just one thing. It was everything. From the bread to the Wine. Yes, even the Wine was bad. I couldn't finish the meal. And no. I did not take a to go box.

They must have a new Juan or Hector cooking the food in the kitchen.  It certainly didn't taste like an Italian was cooking.

Terrible meal"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The food is SO good that we eat here twice this week! Definitely eating here again when I come back to Vegas (or Chicago)."}
{"text":"Pasta was great and I dont like chains! Service was awesome.great meatballs.love the look of the place..great job!"}
{"text":"Dear Maggiano's,
I used to love you and want to love you again but tonight was terrible. First off, our reservation was for 6:45pm. At 7pm we still weren't seated and only after reminding the hostess of our reservation did she \"find\" a table for us 5-10 mins later. We sat in Joanne's section. She started off ok, recommended specials, and took our order. She delivered our bottle of wine and poured our first glasses. Well, that's when the service ended. The rest of the bottle was poured by me for my wife and my glasses. At one point I refilled my empty glass in front of her to prove a point but that was lost on her. The food was good as usual but there ambiance wasn't and the service clinched it for us. Will we be back?  Probably, but not any time soon and that's a shame considering we've spent thousands here over the years (not bragging, being honest). Please retrain your team, and by the way whomever was the manager on duty tonight they were invisible. Never saw them all night."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go there when ever I am in the fashion Show mall.. The food is ALWAYS AWESOME!!!.. Really good service, nice atmosphere. I travel a lot and truly think this place is delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time at this location. It was excellent. The food was yummy and well prepared. I notice lots of time Italian food gets cold fast but it stay hot thur the whole meal. The services was slightly slow but food was so amazing."}
{"text":"In addition to the outstanding food and service, the servers at the bar were friendly and showed genuine interest in new and regular customers. Their Italian food and wine selection are excellent, but this time around I tried their grilled salmon. A very busy place but worth the short wait."}
{"text":"I remember going to Maggiano's in Chicago when I was little; but being a picky little kid eater who didn't like sit-down restaurants, I was never a big fan. 

After years of growing to love Italian food, and trying many Italian restaurants in Phoenix and on the East coast, this Maggiano's is now my favorite Italian restaurant. The food is absolutely phenomenal. I could eat it every day (and the only other Italian food that I could eat every day is my mom's). This is incredibly convenient because Maggiano's offers the buy one, take one home free entrees. Each of these two meals is really big enough  for TWO meals (if you have the self-restraint to not bust through your pants), so I end up eating Maggiano's 4 times for $12.95.

I LOVE garlic, onions, basil, and lots of flavor, and Maggiano's definitely delivers on this.

I love the way Maggiano's is set up, and have loved every drink I've tried there. Maggiano's has been the restaurant I always pick for special occasions. 

I would say that the lasagna is my all-time favorite. Order that!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with maggianos, especially for larger groups. It is a great place to share a family style meal. My favorite appetizer is definitely the fried zucchini, which I am officially addicted to."}
{"text":"Even though I live in Vegas, this is still one of my favorite places to eat.  Request a window view or sit outside if the weather permits.  They have a Happy Hour which is nice and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's- This is a bit of a drive for me so I've only been once but it was a delightful experience. Entrée prices are reasonable...our bill added up quickly because we had quite a few add-ons. Three people for lunch...I think our bill ended up being around $95 or so after tip. We all had a beverage to start, soda and iced teas. Service was pretty slow but we were in no rush as it was a birthday lunch and our waiter was friendly. The entire lunch took about two hours and it's not because we were eating slow. 

We started with the Mozzarella Marinara -Breaded mozzarella, served with marinara sauce. Let me tell you...I am not one to order appetizers usually as they are usually $10 extra on your bill and too much food. This is the one exception I will always make! This was fresh mozzarella...not sticks, but two giant squares! The breading was perfect and their marinara sauce is the best I have tasted! This was such a nice treat and well worth the price! They did bring some bread which was probably pretty good but it doesn't stand out too much in my mind. We all had a different salad before our entrees. As most of their salads included meat, I ordered their plainest house salad...this salad was very sad and not worth the $5 or $6 it cost. The other specialty salads looked good but mine was literally iceberg lettuce with a very sad, very light coat of Italian dressing. My salad looked dry and boring...and that's exactly how it tasted. It's okay though because the entrée more than made up for it! All three of us were in complete disbelief and shock but the entrees we ordered were listed under Classic Pastas, which apparently include an additional take-home dish! If you order a Classic Pasta, you get any Classic Pasta to take home. They are in foil baking pans with instructions and have been pre-made but not yet cooked. I was so excited because it meant I would get to try multiple dishes! FYI...as these dishes are pre-made, you can't make modifications to them. I ordered the Four Cheese Ravioli for my entrée to eat there. It's ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella and provolone. Served in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara. Beautiful presentation and they tasted delightful. The sauce was very nice but I may just get marinara sauce next time...yes, it is that good! For my take home dish I had the Eggplant Parmesan. This was very easy to make and oh my gosh, it was sooo delish! Sliced eggplant, breaded and fried, layered with Provolone cheese and marinara sauce, served with a small portion of spaghetti marinara that had lots of chunks of fresh garlic cloves! Besides my salad, and I guess on a normal day I could never wait for lunch that long, the food was amazing! I had a great experience. Oh and to top it off...they gave us some lemon cookies for the birthday treat. They were perfect to share, light and lemony. I also liked that they had this as an option on the dessert menu...it gives you a lighter and more affordable option if you're craving a little sugar after your meal."}
{"text":"I have never been more impressed with service at a restaurant in all my years. NATHAN absolutely stole our hearts with his presence, attention and passion for serving. He lit our entire experience on fire in the best of ways. I'm nearly at a loss for words but I feel it necessary to attempt to explain how incredible our dining experience was this evening. If I owned this restaurant, I would pass it on to NATHAN happily knowing that my restaurant would go on to honor the essence of why the food industry was truly established, outside of monetary pursuits, but to serve."}
{"text":"I love this place. The portions are huge. I'd rather have a smaller portion with a salad included.  The bread and olive oil is ok at best. The view of the strip makes it nice."}
{"text":"The food was great and the server gave helpful advice. We really enjoyed our first visit at this Maggiano's. Their moscato monitor was amazing!!  I really liked the stuffed mushroom but didn't stand out from other places for me (such as Buca di Beppo). We ordered the lobster alforno (lobster Mac n cheese) and frutti di mare. The pastas were good, but didn't quite stand out. The hostesses were friendly, would recommend you to check out this place for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food, as always, was delicious! The best part of our experience was our server, Michelle.  She made our visit wonderful. Thank you Michelle!!!"}
{"text":"4 girls, Wednesday night

Server was uneducated about the menu.
Food was ok
Maggiano's Salad tasted odd.  Only two of us tasted it then sent it back because of the smell/odd taste.  The two girls that tasted it (one being me) spent the next day with stomach pains and (me) in bed with an explosive situation (from both ends if you know what I mean)  Food POISONING???!!!

NOT GOOD!  Can't return."}
{"text":"It makes me sad that I can get better pasta at Vapianos for $10 vs here. 
It also makes me sad that my server got my order wrong twice and then boxed up the wrong food. It just wasn't her night but it makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed. Outstanding pasta selection and the take home is just as good. I could eat it every day."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions. Waiter (Eli) provided excellent service! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, not overly awesome.

We had a lot of our dishes and silverware that were dirty or had food on them....that was really gross.  Had to ask multiple times for things we needed.  Not sure if I'd really \"crave\" to go back."}
{"text":"New year's lunch at Maggiano's was so-so. We were seated immediately, arriving at 1 pm. We looked over the menu for 30 mins! Finally our order was taken. The food came but not by our waiter, by another waiter. Our waiter rarely checked on us, but he did bring ice tea. He never checked to see if we liked our food. The food is OK, Bucca and Rigatony's is waaay better. We were disappointed.We will not be going back. AND on the way out we saw our waiter watching football on tv at the bar!!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner there with my wife. We drove all the way from Fayetteville NC to eat at this place. First off let me say that the decor and ambiance was great for a romantic evening even with a local school prom going on. I gave them 3 stars only because the food is not authentic Italian. The mix an American flavor with Italian dishes. I tried their signature famous D, riggatoni and it was basically pot roast and hamburger eith noodles and beans. Not good long story short my wife an I tried 2 dishes each until we found something we liked. But the staff and manager was very friendly and knowlagebale and went out of their way to make us happy with our dishes. So again maggianos is good as long as you know it's not authentic, but I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to Maggiano's, based on several recommendations from friends and family. The first thing i noticed when arriving was the apparent lack of seating in the waiting area. A few more chairs or even a comfy sofa would have been appreciated. The restaurant was dimly lit, obviously to set the mood. Seating was surprisingly quick, but the wait service was surprisingly slow. I was amazed how long it took for the waiter to come by the table just to greet and take drink orders. The food was certainly above par for most italian restaurants in the area. I am a fan of the pasta dishes, particularly the rigatoni - D. I was happy to take part in the buy 1 dinner, take one home promotion that had started a few days before my visit. Like i said, the speed of service needed to be ramped up a tad, as the restaurant was not overly crowded. The one thing i was a little taken back by, was the restrooms on the second floor. It seemed a little out of the way and slightly inconvenient for those folks, like myself, who had never dined there before. But, the food quality and upscale atmosphere makes up for it quite nicely."}
{"text":"Lots of good cheap inexpensive food. Amazing ambiance in a great mall and nice affluent region."}
{"text":"The food was really good -- my gosh, the desserts were delicious. However, when my husband and I arrived, it took us literally over 30 minutes to be seated. Our host, Antonio, had bright red eyes and was slurring his words. It was apparent that he was high. He didn't apologize for the wait and gave me dirty looks. Funny enough, we didn't see him around for the rest of the evening. Our waitress was super sweet, though. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have being here a couple of times , and all experience so we're excellent. .food is delicious , atmosphere is great. .love the complimentary bread..fettuccine to die for..definitely my place to eat when I shop at fashion show"}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly personnel but far from authentic Italian fare, therefore too expensive, we shall not return."}
{"text":"Such a good food!!! \"Grilled Salmon Salad\" I will recommend to everyone. Great services."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant I work at a hotel in the area and recommend many people their for when they are in the mood for Italian. I just moved to Arizona and a guest came back with a dish for me. I fell in love. the fettuccine Alfredo is to die for."}
{"text":"Really good. Excellent food. Best waiter ever. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"First, service was excellent. Server was attentive,  despite our long stay. Great job describing dishes as well. Food was very enjoyable, along with the value of taking an extra dish home for dinner. The option for calorie lighter dishes worked great for a couple of my friends,  and all dishes were prepared well. Greatly enjoyed my first visit here in years"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge. It's definitely difficult to finish a plate but the leftovers are great. This is a place I've been to a couple times and will most certainly return to the next time I'm in town. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've had decent meals here, usually with a few other couples and a few adult beverages. This time with the family it was a different story. My advice-Beware if you order any beef dish. I ordered the Braised Beef Pappardelle, with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. Waiter didn't tell me that it came over pasta and it only came with a small amount of shredded beef. Or did it? Because I never got the mashed potatoes and the description mentioned nothing about pasta. It had obviously been left under a heat lamp because the plate rim was very hot, the food was only warm, and the sauce had started to congeal. I ate maybe a third of it and the bus boy came by and started clearing the dishes. What am I going to do, complain to him? My daughter ordered the filet with asparagus risoto. A bunch of under cooked asparagus, a reasonable amount of risoto and 3 little slices (2 ounces?) of well done beef (filet?) about the size of your little finger. By the way, she ordered it pink, which after verbally stumbling around we agreed was medium. More signs it sat under a heat lamp?"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday night and sat at the bar to which I was pleasantly greeted by one of the cutest bartenders I've seen in a while. Yes, scenery matters :) Anyway, ordered the Moscato Mojito and was thrilled. Very sweet and good! For dinner I ordered a side Caesar and the Linguini mare..... The caesar never came but I'm not going to fault the bartender for that. When sitting at the bar, do Not sit at the end by the hostess stand... All the obnoxious Scottsdale people approach there and for some reason feel the need to Scream out their reservation time... Really annoying which leads me to believe the bartender never heard me when I ordered the salad. The linguini was great! I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here on a date and I have to say, the food was wonderful. Absolutely delicious. My only complaint is the waitress completely ignored me. Super weird and uncomfortable. She didn't ask me what I wanted to drink just walked away after taking my fiancés order, never got a refill, and anytime she came to check on us... wouldn't acknowledge me. I'm not one to complain or notice really but by the end of the night it's upset me pretty badly."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  Hostess, was rude, bartender was slow, they brought me something other than what I ordered and then insisted it was correct, so I just let it go and ate it, not sure when a char crusted steak is served with no char and some horrific sauce all over it.  No manager ever checked in, even after I discussed the error with the bartender.  It was crystal clear why this place had so many empty tables.  Apparently, I missed the memo that this place is terrible.  Won't be fooled again!"}
{"text":"Food was decent - nothing too great. Three of us had the Famous Rigatoni D - I don't know why it's famous: it didn't taste like much, the sauce was very liquid, chicken was bland. One of my friends had the eggplant - it was fine. Overall, three stars. Service was nice, prices are decent for the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty nice for a restaurant interior wise beautiful setting clean old style Italian.  The pros and cons are the food especially the chicken dishes were delicious I thought they were cooked properly.  I felt there was just too much Sage in the Chicken Saltimbocca.  The pasta is OK;  its pretty hard to get pasta wrong.   I appreciate the fact that they offer a lighter side option without butter and olive oil.

The con for me was I didn't appreciate the waiter hovering over the table and side of the booth.  I don't feel it's professional to sit on a booth or put your knees on a booth or bend your whole body over the side of the booth into the space of the guest.  Too close for comfort for me."}
{"text":"It had been a number of years since my last visit to Maggianos.  My most recent trip to Maggianos was in mid-November.  The purpose of the event gets 5 stars. However, the continental buffet was not as great as I expected.  For a restuarant that is in one of the premier malls (SouthPark) in Charlotte, with the prime location and its' reputation, I just expected better tasting food.  The buffet was not as hot as it should be,  As I walked from my table to get in line for the buffet, I noticed that the floors looked as if they had not been swept or cleaned from the last event...which may have been the night before...or days before!  The most positive thing about Maggiano's was the decor.  The dark wood and numerous dining areas made me feel better as I left!
I may go back again to see if they still have the level of quality that made it a must visit years ago."}
{"text":"Formerly on of my favorite italian spots to frequent, my last trip went a long way to changing my opinion. The waiter was disorganized. At various times be absconded with my unused napkin, half my silverware and my dinner companion 's entire place setting. Getting spelnda for my sweet tea took three requests.
Then came the meal. The baked ziti in pomodoro sauce with sausage salty to the point of being inedible. The fettucini alfredo was passable, but only after the addition of some grated Parmesan after the dish arrived to thicken it and add flavor. The (unfortunate) highlight of the meal was the cheesecake which I strongly suspect was bought in and not house-made.
Unfortunately, last night's trip gave me an Olive Garden experience at triple the price. I will be hard pressed to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places. I go for lunch or will order takeout at times. Either way I always get a great deal with either the lunch combos or adding on another dish for $5 at the take out. I usually get lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs. 

Also had family in town for holidays and we ordered from here and they all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very classy bar area, clean bathrooms, wonderful patio and helpful staff.

We were waited on by a young guy named Robert who attended to my friend and I wonderfully.  I haven't had service this courteous and prompt in years.

My friend had the \"San Francisco\" lobster linguine but replaced the linguine with wheat penne.  It was SO tasty!

I had the \"Chicago-style\" pasta.  It was bland and uneventful.  I even told our waiter but what can they do?

The bread we ate while we waited was fresh and tasty.  

The real value to this place is the Italian dining-like experience on the strip without the large price tag.  I believe there were many lunch offerings for 12-15 dollars and there are a bunch of patio tables to take in the fresh air.

It was all but empty inside but this might be a classy dining experience for couples during the evening."}
{"text":"I should have guessed that a restaurant that is willing to flop down a sticky filthy menu that I'm expected to touch right before eating wouldn't deliver on quality. Second time here in recent years. This place has declined significantly in quality. Food was extremely late and then extreme bland. Filled up on bread waiting for it to arrive. Just down get the appeal of this place any longer."}
{"text":"Super disappointed that they don't open until 4pm!  Been waiting months for this location to open, all excited we headed over around 2pm only to find out they don't open for 2 more hours. Heartbroken! :("}
{"text":"Been here several times, the food is okay. 

Our service has been okay.

I'm really just irritated because for the second time now they have forgotten to give us our to go orders. The first time we asked for them and he waiter pretended that they were coming, I just needed to remind him what we ordered. Real smooth.

Tonight however, after we cashed out we waited almost twenty minutes, we were going to remind our waiter but he disappeared. We have a small child and couldn't wait any longer. So we left without our to go meals. 

We did inform the hostess but she was not helpful."}
{"text":"Busy on a Saturday afternoon with multiple exuberant birthday tables. A fellow customer sang jazzy/bluesy \"Happy Birthday\" to several people at different tables. Caesar salad was crisp & tangy. Margurita flat bread was shared with gusto. My linguine with white sauce was a little watery. Service was fast and courteous. Very noisy today."}
{"text":"I'm not big on chain restaurants but Maggiano's is my fav italian spot!  I've never had a bad experience at the Woodland Hills location in CA and LV did not disappoint. The food is always great and so is the service.  I've tried a lot of the appies and my favs are the calamari, stuffed mushrooms and the shrimp oreganata! AWESOME!  I love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo.  As Rachel says...YUM-O!  The maggiano's chopped salad is also great.  

This place all in all is great for groups or even a nice dinner with BF.  Keep it up Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with our Mothers Day Brunch. When we arrived, we were told they weren't offering the brunch menu but a family style option only (Surprise!). This alone would have made us select somewhere different if it was listed anywhere when booking. You couldn't get a simple brunch menu item if you didn't want to order two starters, three entrees and two deserts, awful way to offer a holiday brunch. We asked if we could just order the Benedict, and were told no (after seeing they let the table next to us just order pancakes). We chatted with the kind family and they said how unhappy they were with this surprise family style option only, as they didn't want to order that way and spend that kind of money with their kids. We definitely weren't alone with the disappointment. 

I didn't make brunch reservations to have to order off the dinner menu at 11:15am but didn't have another option. My husband is a vegetarian, and they delivered him smoked ham Benedict instead of smoked salmon as ordered, and he ordered the family style option JUST so he could get that. We then had to wait 15-20 minutes for them to bring his proper order after we all were finished eating. They obviously still rushed it as the egg whites were not even fully cooked on the poached eggs, making the whole dish watery and unappetizing. We left that and took the deserts that he had to order to go. 

My mom ordered the pasta with one to take home, we paid more and selected the mushroom ravioli to bring back. They didn't bring it out and we had to ask for it, which is ok as they said they were busy. We got home to see they gave us fettuccini Alfredo instead (cheaper option). 

This experience alone will have us not returning to Maggiano's in the future."}
{"text":"We love coming here its one of our favorite places. Our waiter really knew his stuff. My wife has a gluten-free diet and it's hard to go anywhere, but our waiter assured us we were in the right place and shared the gluten-free options. My wife had a great meal and mine was delicious as well we're very happy"}
{"text":"Italian Food.  When it comes to that cuisine it's always difficult to find a stand out or outstanding place, without costing an arm and a leg.  Yes there are some really good Italian joints in the valley, but most of them are high end or expensive.  I find Maggiano's prices reasonable, great portions, and nice atmosphere.  I agree they might not  be the best Italian place in the valley, but they hold their own and are better than most chains like Carbarra's, Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, etc.  I've been to this location many times, so I'd figure to write a little review on them.  

I've had awesome service, while I've experienced slow servers before, so it's really hit or miss.  On this night the service was slow, the older server seemed over matched during the night.  He seemed like he was constantly running behind and had a flustered look about him throughout the night.  So I'll give him a break.  The great thing about Maggiano's is you never get cheated on the portions.  The food itself is flavorful and you always have leftovers for the next day.  So our group of three ordered the Saffron Angel hair pasta with lobster, Chicken Parm, mussels, and calamari.  All the dishes were great.  The appetizers were plentiful and delicious.  For 18.00 bucks they give you a good amount of mussels.  I think  that dish was the best.  Since I ordered the pasta dish, they also give you a dish from the Classic pasta section, for you to take home.  So it's like getting another meal to go.

So overall, pretty solid experience as usual from Maggiano's.  They do a great job in terms of Italian food and best of all the prices are reasonable.  Sure there are better places than here for Italian, but paying 30 to 40 for a pasta dish is absurd.   To end the night as I was leaving, I ran into Sheriff Joe.  No comment, no need to get political on yelp, but he seemed to be ready to enjoy a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"Attempted to book Maggiano's for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Dealt very briefly with the booking coordinator named Lori who was so unprofessional that I would not have booked this venue even if it was the LAST restaurant in Las Vegas. I am a local business owner and I am shocked at how a restaurant like Maggiano's handles their guests.  Extremely disappointed since I have used Maggiano's in the past for graduations, etc."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've had in Vegas and the best bruschetta I've ever had anywhere (admittedly I've not yet actually been to Italy though).  The menu options were original and everything we ordered was both extraordinarily flavorful and fresh.  We were there for lunch and the prices were a steal (for example, the $6 bruschetta was the size of a meal in itself and the wine by the glass was also reasonable by Vegas standards).  

Our waiter was nothing special, but we wanted for nothing.  And while the dining experience for me is usually diminished when dining in a mall (even a Vegas mall), I found that the location was actually quite nice and lended itself to great views of the strip.  I would have liked to have tried the desserts but I hardly could finish my meal because of the large portions--I guess that means I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Love love love Maggianos! The service is always fantastic, the food is even better, and the drinks never disappoint. The patio has a nice little view of the Wynn and the strip. Maggianos never disappoints!"}
{"text":"What a great spot in Vegas.  It may be a chain, but its run like its an original. Great service and decor.  Food was pretty good as well.  The gf and I got bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms for apps.  Both were great!  For dinner the gf went with chicken marsala and I with the francaise.  Both came with sides.   I opted for the fried potatoes and she for the linguine with garlic and oil.  I threw in a side of broccolini to have a nice lil veggie in the mix.

Well 1 - 10:
apps 10
marsala 7 - salty but good.
francaise 5 - It wasn't bad, but I have had much better and expected more.
ling with g&o - 2  No taste at all
Potatoes - 7
Broccolini - 10 nicely cooked and seasoned in garlic and oil

The menu is very extensive and overall it was a great time with the gf.  I am looking forward to checking out the Maggiano's in north Jersey."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we came here on Friday and fell in love. Everything from our drinks, the appetizer, the entree, and the dessert were pristine. So much so, that we took our grandmother here two days later for Mothers Day. 

It was probably the biggest mistake we could have made. They were out of quite a few items, which was understandable due to the high volume of people. We were super thankful they weren't out of any of the items we wanted. Our appetizers came and although they were the exact same as the ones we'd ordered on Friday, they weren't of the same caliber. They weren't even hot. But we brush it off, because it's busy. 

Then our entrees come. Two of us have ordered the filet mignon. The filet was cooked the way it should have been, but there was absolutely no flavor. We had to salt and pepper our own steaks just to make it bearable to eat. And there was supposed to be garlic butter over the steak but it was missing. Thankfully our grandma enjoyed her pasta. We knew we should have stuck to the pasta as well, but when the price tag is $32 per steak, you expect it to taste better than what'd you'd get at a chilis. 

But who wants to make a big deal on Mother's Day? So we hold out for dessert. We've been raving to our grandmother about the butter cake. We've been talking about it all weekend. 

And it comes out. And our server tells us they only have the mini cakes instead of the big ones. We say that's okay. But we're confused. We were told everything is made to order. But if the cakes were made to order why not just put the batter into the single cake mold? Seems off. And it looks like there's very minimal marscapone on the dish. Maybe a dime size amount it was ridiculous. It is the main star. So we ask her for some, and she comes back to tell us they are out of the mascarpone and that actually there is none on our plates but instead, whipped cream. She does apologize but she more so blames the kitchen for not telling her in advance. And she doesn't ask if we want something else. And she charges us full price for each dessert (even though we didn't get the FULL dessert and the mini cakes individually cost less than the full?)

Needless to say, disappointed doesn't begin to cover how we feel. we thought this was the best restaurant we'd ever been to. We were so impressed on Friday as EVERYTHING was amazing. But clearly this place is not consistent. 

Our server was not attentive at all. We had to ask her to refill our drinks and she would be gone for long periods of time. I know it was a holiday but the table next to us had a server that was extremely attentive, almost as if she never left their side. 

it ruined Mother's Day. We'd been raving about this place and you guys fell so short. We didn't want to make a fuss in front of our grandmother, but I doubt we will ever be coming back. Which is a shame, because we assumed we'd found the perfect place and we intended to frequent this location. 

The bill wasn't cheap, we expect to get what we pay for. And we had no problem with our bill on Friday. We even OVER tipped because the service was that impeccable. But today, I felt like we were at an Applebee's. We didn't get what we paid for in terms of service or taste. 


UPDATE::::::::

When I say they redeemed themselves, I mean they REDEEMED THEMSELVES.

They reached out to us and offered us a discount for the bad experience. The manager was amazingly kind and seemed genuinely interested in making our experience better. 

A little insider tip: ask for Michelle or Drew. Both servers are the epitome of excellence. And when they pour the oil for your bread, ask for Parmesan and cracked pepper. It makes the bread even better. If that's even possible. 

And definitely go for one of the chef specials on the menu hidden on the inside. There are no words to describe how amazing the flavor is. And you get to take a pasta home for later. Not to mention how generous the portions are! 

I can't say enough about how pleased I am with our third experience. The food is amazing if you stick to the pastas. And these two servers will absolutely not let you down. 

We'll be back, and often. It's our new favorite go to restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped for a late lunch. The food, and service are good. We had a nice view of the Vegas strip towards Circus Circus. The Italian food here was delicious."}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from some good friends my wife and I gave this place a try a few years back, and every year we make sure this restaurant is a part of our annual Vegas trips. 

The service is always stellar and friendly. The prices are decent as well.  The portions are perfect for sharing and you just can't help but savour the wide range of flavour each dish presents itself. There is both a subtly and boldness with each pasta dish. We leave full and content but not bloated and overstuffed like you can at some pasta places. In some ways this is a nice escape from the Fashion Show mall, the views from the restaurant are wonderful, as you sit across the Wynn and the places offers a bit of calm from the strip itself. 

I have had a few dishes here over the years and so far each one has been wonderful. Try something yourself as I am confidant that you will experience the flavours and enjoy the atmosphere as much as we do each year."}
{"text":"Perhaps the chef changed or memory makes the taste buds fonder.  S swears this was a better place to buy a meal when last in Vegas.  They seated us right away on a Tuesday evening and the Cesar gave us stellar service.  This is Maggiano's so I didn't raise an eyebrow at $12 for a small glass of the \"house\" red (Cherry Tart pinot noir).  He recommended the risotto fritte for appetizer which I requested and we had the gnocchi in vodka sauce with Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The house bread they bring for free is awesome.  You can season some olive oil with pepper and Parmesan for dipping.  I'd say don't ruin your appetite but the quality of the food gave me pause to cancel that suggestion.  They served the risotto fritte quickly and upon seeing it, they are effectively arancini with pepperoni mixed in.  They are salty but dip it in the marinara they provide and they not only become brutally salty but the sauce obscures any subtlety of flavor in the balls.  By the time they brought our entrees I was starting to get full.  Both dishes suffered from the same affliction as the arancini.  Perfectly good pasta (wonderfully tender gnocchi especially) coated in supremely salty sauces.  I took a few forkfuls and asked for a box (as cold leftovers - once a lot of the sauce fell off was ok to eat).  About $75 for two with tip.  The waiter and staff definitely earned a top review and an extra star but considering the meal quality that only earns this place somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars."}
{"text":"I clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews. this was my second visit here. the first being a few years ago. 
I do not even know where to begin. 
The place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.
Our server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. 
The food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had. 
Save your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation. 
I for one will never go back."}
{"text":"Service was good , bread good , view excellent . Had chicken Marsala and it was tough. It's not that hard to cook chicken , kinda disappointed. Had been excited to go and I probably won't go back . Better local Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas valley ."}
{"text":"As always, I am never disappointed with Maggiano's.  I come here to only get the Chicken Saltimbocca and I never eat anything else.  I really enjoy this dish and when I have the opportunity I try to make it here for dinner or lunch.  The waitress I had was very good and friendly.  I will always come back to Maggiano's no matter what city I am traveling to.  Thank you to the staff for a job well done."}
{"text":"The Four Stars have it on this one.  Very good food and service at a very reasonable price for the strip.  We have a friend with an egg alergy and (when we inform the waiter of her condition) the chef always comes out to take her order.  It may be required by their policy, but they do it cheerfully and always try to make it fun.  We ate there two nights during our last stay.  Having said that, the menu is different from our local Maggiano's (where you are given an additional equal size take home portion of some entrees for one price).   However, it's better on price, food and service than other options available in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and service! Jose was totally amazing, attentive, and funny! Thank you for making up for our lame dining experience at another Italian restaurant last night and making my daughters birthday great!!! Food and beverages were fab!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Their food is amazing. We had the lobster carbonara, and one of their vegetarian ravioli dishes on their make a wish menu. Both were very tasty. Plates range from about 12-20 on average. The steak dishes are about double that. The chocolate cake is a must!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a few times and the food is always excellent, service is wonderful. Had a really awesome deal where you can share an appetizer with someone, get a meal there, one to go, and split a desert for someone all for about $43 !! Super great (forgot to mention the meal you can pick from is the traditional pastas, but all delicious!!)"}
{"text":"Came with our couples ministry from church to celebrate Valentine's day. It was group of 10ppl. They make sure your whole party is present before you're seated. Even though it was a dreary day, we were seated on the patio that was enclosed and with heaters. Our group ate family style the following:

Caesar salad
Antipasto
Mozzarella Marinara
Chicken Parmesan
Chicken and Spinach Manicotti
Lasagna
Grilled Salmon
Apple Crostada
Cheesecake

I tried a little of everything except the lasagna due to it having pork sausage in it. Service was ok, could of been better but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here and have lunch. Boy am I glad that we did! Maggiano's was delicious!! I really regret not taking pictures of our food but I was enjoying it so much that I was too busy stuffing my face and didn't think to pull out the camera. 

I'm a total soup girl, so after hearing the day's selection of soups, I decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup. When it arrived my jaw dropped. I asked for a cup (or small ...whatever) and it arrived in a huge bowl!! The portions were huge! I even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". Well, the soup was delicious. It was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  My mom ordered the \"small\" Spinach Salad and that was delicious as well. Never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. We would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!

Okay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake Sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"Crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. Served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the Seared Salmon Sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). THOSE WERE THE 2 BEST DAMN SANDWHICHES I'VE EVER HAD!!!! OMGGGG!! Sooo yummyyyy!!! I think it's funny that we were at an Italian restaurant and didn't have pasta but I am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious!

We were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers, happily! LOL! We were very happy with our lunch from Maggiano's and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to Vegas.

Although I am in the Bay and heard there's a Maggiano's down in San Jose, I rarely head down to the South Bay so I doubt I'll be visiting that one. I highly suggest the location in Las Vegas!! 

p.s. Excellent service as well! Oh yeah, and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice! The weather was perfect!"}
{"text":"Not only does this restaurant offer a classic yet stylistic ambiance reminiscent of old Hollywood glamour, maggiano's serves flavorful dishes that are freshly made with fine ingredients. Most notable about their dining experience however,  is the personalized and attention to detail oriented service. Penny was phenomenal, and our special celebration (having twins and a birthday) was acknowledged by just about every staff member we engaged with. We were even surprised with a delightful complementary dessert. Will we come back in the future?  ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"It was ok not outstanding but not bad either.  I thought it was a little pricey for the quality.  The best value is their BOGO classic pastas.  That said a lot of people go their it was crowded and reservations required."}
{"text":"Oh how I love the food and the service at Maggiano's. Easy to make reservations online and we arrived and were seated in one of the best tables ever! The view of the strip while eating and conversing is everything! For the first time my girls and I had the delicious brunch!!! I didn't even know they had brunch until I saw their eye catching Facebook ad for $2 mimosas. Yes, I said $2! Gunner (hope that's spelled correctly) was our server and he was funny and swift with all of our request. You must stop by and have a meal at Maggiano's everything on the menu is delightful!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest Italian food lover, but I enjoy Maggiano's every time I go. Randomly craved Italian food particular last week, so decided to go here. Great views of the strip! I enjoyed a simple spaghetti marinara and my bf got the eggplant pasta. We ordered a side of the calamari. Everything was plentiful and great-tasting."}
{"text":"I had never been here, but we were doing a combo bachelorette/birthday and this place was awesome.  One waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way!  OOOOHHHH I'm SCARED - she kept giving us mean looks but WHATEVS.  Getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  Someone has to take control!  I ordered a Reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  With large parties, the restaurant STRONGLY \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is FINE by me.  It actually works to your advantage because then you aren't squabling over the damn check.  Of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didn't get her own way.  Well OKAYYYYYY.  So we finally decided on the chopped salad and spiniach salad and the bride is Jewish so we asked for bacon/pork on the side, which was no problem.  The brushetti was awesome, the bread great and the spinach dip was ok, kinda like the frozen kind, just ok.  The ravioli was great!  The waiter even brought me and another girl a sample (large sample) of the pesto with chicken and it was my FAV - we both wanted to order it for the entree, but because of the family style, we couldn't.  Two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu, which they said was fine, as long as at least 6 wanted family style - that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal, which was $22.50 per person, I ended up putting in $35 which covered my dinner, wine, tax and tip - couldn't beat it with a stick.  The food is 10000000000 times better than stinky old Buca di Pepto Bismal!!  I highly recommend this place and I'm a picky eater.  LOVE IT"}
{"text":"I probably had the best meal ever here. I had the chicken & truffle tortellacci and a glass of white wine. It was so delicious. My date had the spaghetti and meatballs which was also delicious. I don't know what took me so long to try this restaurant out. We also received great service from our server as well which made my date even better. I will make sure to come back again before the close down."}
{"text":"What a find. Forget buffets, this is as good as it gets for a reasonable meal.  Best veal parmessan and oh the tiramisu.  As good as it gets, light, airy and full of flavor. Heavenly."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo (lighter choice). It was delicious. We also order the 5 mini deserts for I believe $13. Pretty and very good. Best tiramisu I've had. Favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've dined there several times and each time it was a pleasure.  Great food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Maggiano's. i have to say our server Derek D was outstanding. He took great care of our table and made us all feel welcome. The chef came out to talk with my daughter about gluten free options which really made her happy. The food was great! We ordered family style and it just kept coming. I highly recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"If you want a good priced pretty good Italian restaurant this is a place to come especially in Scottsdale I had the chicken and rigatoni was pretty good sauce was a little flat chicken taste like it was boiled not grilled but overall it was okay but I definitely recommend Diablo probably one of the best in the valley just spicy enough but full flavor my favorite thing was a creme brulee so far probably the best I've had and AZ the butter cake sucks really has nothing going for it rather had a piece of bread service pretty decent she was on top of most things not the best not the worst but average definitely will be back"}
{"text":"It was a sad, sad morning when I realized that with my newly gluten-free-ness, I couldn't run to greasy pizza as a hangover remedy.  I was soooo so happy to find Maggiano's though!  The BF and I were on a quest, and we came across the menu that graciously advertised gluten-free pasta, so in we went.

The server was a SUPER HAPPY fella, who brought the chef over to customize my meal basically however I wanted!  I ended up with some baked corn pasta with chicken, marinara sauce and cheese - DELICIOUS!! 

It's classy inside, but the lunch prices were totally fine (for Vegas standards, that is), plus the portions were huge.  The waiter kept our water coming and even gave the BF two glasses at a time ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, plenty to take home afterwards.  We absolutely love this restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Just had such a wonderful, delicious, caring experience at this fine establishment. Our waiter, Nestor Inostroza was friendly, professional, knowledgeable and caring. I alerted him to the fact of my lifelong, life threatening allergy to fresh and salt water fish (I can eat yummy shellfish, yes, the opposite of most). He immediately told me he would get the head chef to come speak to us. 
Chef Eric Anderson came out immediately, spoke to me about my menu choice, took notes! and assured me everything would be done to assure my safety down to no possible cross contamination. You could tell he was sincere and took this very seriously which was so wonderful as, unfortunately most restaurants can't be bothered, or just tell you to order something else. This location is one of their Busiest, yet they accommodate food allergies with such care and compassion, it proves, all you need is a little integrity and humanity. 
Both my dish (crab cakes with arugula salad) and my husbands (filet) were perfection. 
Do yourself a favor and ask for Nestor as your waiter and treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"So first off, I enjoyed their outside seating area they were very quick to sit us down on a Saturday night. Were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food, the calamari for appetizer was glorious. I had the lobster carbonara and I absolutely loved it, keep in mind there actually big portions so I wasn't able to finish it. Got a to go box for sure, you don't let good things like that go to waste. My friend got the ravioli,  he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though. Bread they brought out with the balsamic  was amazing I now want to go to the store and do that for myself. I very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back, today I went to Hooters for lunch and even though I'm stuffed from it I have the lobster carbonara in my fridge I refuse to go bad so that's what I'm eating now, i'm a fat ass."}
{"text":"My family went here to celebrate a birthday. The service and the food were excellent. The server heard us talk about a discontinued appetizer. She checked with the kitchen and they could make it for us. Mom's lasagne was also superb. What a great evening!"}
{"text":"Tonight was amazing! We drove here from Mesa because I wanted a fun, festive atmosphere for dinner on Christmas Eve .  It was PACKED! We waited over an hour past our reservation time, but we found a spot in the bar and ordered appetizers and drinks. the mozzarella squares were delicious!!!! The calamari was good along with the bruschetta. The entrees were good, I didn't love the presentation of the lobster dish, especially for the price. I wouldn't order that again. We even got a few pasta dishes to take home for a lazy lunch tomorrow.  Extremely impressed with the service and quality of food considering how SLAMMED the place was! True sign of a well run restaurant is how they handle stress and volume. Gabriel was our waiter and he was extremely pleasant and very professional. Thank you Maggianos for making our Christmas Eve so festive and perfect! Now, hopefully you all can go home and enjoy your holiday."}
{"text":"I typically am not a fan of chain restaurants but Maggiano's is really good. I've been to this location multiple times the staff is always friendly and good at their job from the hostess to the bartender and the waitstaff.
I've had many of the appetizers including the zucchini and the mozzarella. I've tried most of the entrees and I really have no complaints. If you are looking for a really good bowl of spaghetti with marinara and a meat ball theirs is definitely my favorite. 
My only complaint about the food is about the salads, I really prefer romaine to iceberg, so I don't love their salads but that may just be a personal preference.
I've also tried many of their desserts all of which have been delicious. The creme brûlée is my favorite."}
{"text":"We went for Dinner and I made reservations on OpenTable which is super easy. We arrived and were seated within a couple minutes. The waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order. When he came back he had the Chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the Chicken Parmesan which she loved. My 11 year old got the Mama's Lasagna & my 13 year old got the Fettuccine Alfredo and they both thought it was epic. I enjoyed my Veal Parmesan and instead of the Spaghetti I asked for the Fettuccine Alfredo and they said no problem. I have to say the food was good but the service was Great. My wife got the Creme Brûlée for Desert which she always enjoys. It has become a must visit when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. I have been to many locations I love the Las Vegas the best. Always busy, exceptional food and great wine.
I go here every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Arrived at 5pm and they were already 86ing a pot roast dinner that is a regular on their menu. That was the meal I drove 45 minutes for.  Ordered the crab cakes instead and they were pretty devoid of crab with lots of filler and no flavor and $32 to boot.  Will not be coming back too many other  marginal places that are less expensive and closer to home. Meal took about 2 hours so don't be in a rush.  Only reason not a 1 star is great apologetic service."}
{"text":"Must try. I just randomly selected this restaurant during traveling with my wife. The food and service are amazing. We ordered the combo for 2. All are delicious.. Will be back for sure if we visit this city again."}
{"text":"The best Italian place!  Excellent food and great friendly staff!  Love the lasagna and spaghetti!  Servings are huge!  Come hungry!  Great value for quality food and ingredients!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed! My wife and I love going to this Resturant when we are at the Fashion Show.  It's easy to get to and never much of a wait if you go around 5ish. If you go after that time, I recommend getting reservations. 

I always get the lasagna- I have always been happy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband and I's favorite restaurants. We've been here many times and went back last night for valentines day. We arrived 30 minutes before our reservation and were prepared to just wait, but we were seated within a minute. Our service was slightly slower than usual, but considering the place was packed it was understandable and expected. Our drinks and salads were great as always as well as our pasta. I even liked the cheesecake, and i hate cheesecake. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, great place for a date night. The food was delicious, the staff was nice, and the atmosphere was clean and beautiful. We had the spinach artichoke dip which has a nice creamy texture. We also had the chicken and veal parmesan. Both were incredibly tender and full of flavor. I feel obligated to mention it's a tad pricey, but you get enough food for two or three days. Definitely worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"Had a great rehearsal dinner here. I thought that the atmosphere was very nice and beautiful. The servers were very attentive and polite with the exception of one who was checking her phone once when I looked over. Another thing that I didn't really like was that the lasagna had a little too much tomato sauce. Other than that, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Sure, Maggiano's Little Italy is chain Italian - but it is TASTY, upscale, chain Italian :) 

While in Vegas, Maggiano's was right across from our hotel (Trump). As my husband and I had been once before in St. Louis and enjoyed it, we hoped to have the time to try it again. It also turns out that I had some rewards points that could be turned into a gift card here, which presented the perfect opportunity. 

Let me first say, the hostess, manager, and our waiter especially were awesome! Professional, efficient, and very friendly. They seemed to be having a great time, which is always a good sign.

The food was also excellent. Between the three of us, we tried the lasagna (with marinara), lasagna (with meat sauce), and the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage dish. All were wonderful. 

Also while dining, there were two musicians that came around and asked if you would like them to play the table a song - which similarly happens in Italy. Very charming."}
{"text":"Great quality pasta and quality drinks made by a veteran bar tender.... They are little tough on price here but you simply can't feed the atmosphere and quality so if you got the time and a little extra cash definitely stop here"}
{"text":"This Maggiano's location fits the bill! This is one of numerous locations that I've visited and it was packed with patrons. I snagged some space at the bar and got a beer. The service was great considering the number of drink orders coming to the window! 

Save yourself some time and order the Rigatoni D or Mushroom and Veal ravioli's. You can't go wrong with either. 

This Maggiano's should be here to stay, great location in South Park."}
{"text":"Good solid Italian food.  We had eaten here once before, again with some of our kids.

The food was very good.  As described in the menu, except the dressing on the salad was extremely salty; we all agreed that if we ordered that salad again, no dressing (or on the side).  The prawns in their signature red sauce were generous in portion size, and excellent.  The calamari fritti (sp?) were also very good.  The wine list, while not huge, had some very good values.

Service was a bit uneven, though always friendly and apologetic with regard to forgotten items.  Would eat here again, but order a bit different."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf to have a nice lunch but ended up leaving disappointed. Everyone was very nice but the quality of the food has declined unfortunately. . . Not worth the price in my opinion. (60 bucks for some tasteless Alfredo and egg Benedict's. . And The bread was stiff as hell! Probably not worth coming back. The manager did bring us some tasty cookies at the end tho for being locals so that was nice but that's all. Sorry Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Used to be good but not any more. We have been going to Manggiano's for years and had not been for a while. It started bad and ended bad. We were told our table would be a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar and ordered drinks and an appetizer. Ten minutes later they called us for our table after we just ordered drinks and appetizers. I noticed that the prices had gone up at least 10 percent. We ordered the mussels for an appetizer and they came in a watery broth. They were small overcooked and lacked the nice chunk tomatoes and basil that used to be there. The fettuccine Alfredo was a glob of cold pasta and artificial tasting chicken. The waiter took it back but the replacement was not much better. The eggplant Parmesan had mostly breadcrumbs and not much else. Water glasses were not filled, appetizer dishes not cleared and we got our entries before we had finished our appetizer. We had to ask to have the appetizer dishes cleared. Some of their pasta dishes offer a free take home of another dish. They forgot to give it to us. Thanks to the manager who reduced our bill 50%. A nice gesture for sure but they need to get an organized and trained waitstaff. We noticed other tables having logistical errors with their orders also. Food quality and preparation have gone way down and a disappointing dinner was had by all."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night, there was 6 of us. Fabulous dinner. We started with apps, then Caesar salad, then dinner. Every thing was fabulous from start to finish. Service was very good. I had lasagna and I would highly recommend it. Then we each got a pasta to take home. What a deal. There was 6 of us and with apps and salads, the tab was only $145. What a deal. We will be back , keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Just had dinner. I had the chicken caprese. Chicken was good but they put about 12 cherry tomatoes ( red and green) and they were ice cold and put on top of hot chicken. The tomatoes were terrible, especially the green ones."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain restaurant but that doesn't stop it from having delicious food! As you would expect from any decent Italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesn't help. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying. 

Now for my favorite part about this place. They have something called a Family style dinner. To order this you are required a party of 4. The cost is about $35 per person and completely worth it! This includes the following: two appetizers,two salads, two pastas, two entrees and a desert. Now you might be thinking wow that's a rip off? BUT WAIT there is more to this then meets the eye. All the items have to be selected off the pre-build family menu BUT the portions are UNLIMITED!! for instance if you order 2 appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them. Same goes with the salad, pasta and everything else. The kicker here is that you ALSO get to take home your leftovers!

I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Italian food! My personal favorite dish is the following.

Four Cheese Ravioli +
Ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese, then browned in the oven and served in pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara. 

It is AMAZING! It also always puts a smile on my face :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the hubby ! Great atmosphere  Romantic red and white picnic table clothes .family style food . 
I had the tomato soup  Italian salad and a side of penne marinara it was all fantastic . Would def come again ."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed. I got a gift card from my boss for my Birthday. It was good for several places including this one. Since I didn't really like the other places and I had never heard of this one I decided to go with Maggiano's. I was under the impression that this place was super fancy and you could only get in with reservations. It is pretty fancy but reservations are not needed. In fact they seemed to slow us down. That got them minus one star right off the bat. I will say that I did make the right choice and I thank my boss for introducing me to a new place that will go on my list of favorites.
My girlfriend had been here a few times before and also reassured me that I made the right choice. They were pretty busy and it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale so you had to expect some wait time. I also felt like the table they put us at was an after thought spare table that they threw out really quick so they could squeeze in two more. It seemed out of place and up against a column. It was a little cramped but it was fine. I liked the décor of the restaurant. Very nice and upscale. This is no garden of olives that is for sure. I found it funny that as nice as this place was people were still in jeans and t-shirts and gym clothes. Really? You are going out to dinner. At least put on some kind of nice clothes. Funny.
The bread they had was very good. The service was great. Our waitress was very nice and got us everything we needed. My girlfriend already knew what she wanted the same thing she gets every time she comes here the Rigatoni D. I on the other hand being a newbie had trouble deciding. Some many things sounded good. I finally picked the Linguine with white clam sauce. Now I am not a fan of wine sauces, I much prefer cream sauces, but this was good. Clams in the shell which is nice. A little work but still nice. A lot of them too. Great flavor. You do have to pay extra to get a salad. I am a complete meal kind of person salad and an entrée maybe a dessert if there is room. So to have to pay extra just to get a dinner salad is a little off putting but just a little.
We both really liked our meal. I tried a little of what my girlfriend got and I think I will order that next time. It had a white Marsala sauce with mushrooms. That blew my mind a little. I have never seen a Marsala sauce that wasn't brown.
I will definitely be back. Great food. Great service. Really nice restaurant. I can't wait to have an entire plate of their Rigatoni D. The prices weren't that bad either. Even without out the gift card is was no more expensive than any other place and it had much better food.
A better table, less of a wait and my own plate of Rigatoni D might boost this place up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This 2 star rating has nothing to do with the service. Hector was great. The food was fine. Nothing spectacular but not horrible either. I would probably go back just because I enjoy the location and the prices are decent. 
The reason for the 2 stars is because of my experience in the bathroom. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate, and a female server walks in (tall, dirty blonde hair, Caucasian) and starts to make a phone call on speaker. She then proceeds to raise her voice in anger and use profanity (the F word specifically)  while speaking to whomever she was speaking to. I think she said \"you tell her when I get home I'm going to f&$!ing kill her...\" or something similar to that. Now... I also work in a restaurant on the strip, and if any of our employees were to do that, we would be fired for sure. Maybe she's lucky I didn't say anything to a manager or she might be fired too, I don't know if they would even care. That server made Maggiano's look bad in my eyes and I'm sure anyone else would've thought the same thing. Perhaps you shouldn't allow your staff to use the same bathroom as your guests, and all this could've been avoided."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a very well known upscale Italian Restaurant.

My family dines there whenever they visit Chicago. 

The food quality, service, and atmosphere are superior to any Olive Garden or \"chain\" Italian places!

Normally this place is a little dressy but the one here ranges from casual to a suit & tie. Either way it's not a snooty place at all and still very elegant.
The restaurant was rich & the environment was very cool and they were playing Sinatra! The ambience was a hit!

The food portions are extremely generous! The food is delicious! The price is very affordable. Although there are more affordable options we selected a special that cost $30 per person but you get to pick 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts....here's the kicker: You get unlimited refils on everything!!! Yes they'll bring out more salad, more appetizers, and more everything. If you go there with your family you will leave fat & happy + they'll box it up to go.

Everything is made from scratch! The dessert was SO great! It was fresh! I had NY style cheesecake and not only was it enough for two men to eat but also it was incredibly enjoyable, and tasted like it never spent a day in a freezer :-)

Same thing goes for the Tiramisu my wife ordered! OMG it was authentic tasting, huge, and downright yummy!

The service here is outstanding! Our waiter was very professional and efficient. He was pleseant and never rushed us at all.

I highly recommend this place and it goes to the top of my list of Italian restaurants! My #2 fav place in Charlotte so far!

If you want some \"above the rest\" Italian food then you need to try this place. You will love it!"}
{"text":"Darn good Italian Food! Probably some of the best Italian food I've had since I left NY...Other than waiting an hour to be served, and a long hike to get there, worth the wait and exercise. Staff was good and fast (especially the english talking waitress)...Music was Frank Sinatra like, and there was even a guy walking around asking to sing personalized music...Looks like I'll be having my wedding reception here...Let's see...Forgot to mention, I was even watching the Orioles play, and talking to my wife to be as well...She actually thought I was listening to her...What a bonus!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food and great service really makes this location stand out!

Maggiano's is in the Fashion Show mall, and has a large restaurant and bar area (you can eat at the bar with a full menu).  

The food is hot and fresh, and the servers are really on their game...they know what to recommend, they know what they like, and they really help you with your food and wine selections.  The service is really, really good!

They have a full Italian menu, plus steaks and seafood.  You can even order large dishes to share, aka \"Family Style\".  There is usually a Chef's selection or two on the menu, and last night I had the Chef's shells stuffed with Italian beef covered in a red sauce.  It was wonderful.

While the food is excellent, the wine list was just so-so.  There could be a few more wines by the glass on the wine list, in my opinion (Example, they had an average Pinot Noir by the glass on the menu...and no Oregon Pinot's by the glass).  The wine list might need a bit of a tune up.

The restaurant, although very large, fills up quickly...there was quite a wait on a Sunday night, and the bar was packed, so it is best to get a reputation.

The prices and quality of the food is very good, and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place atmosphere is amazing food is always great! Highly recommend to locals and tourist."}
{"text":"Best New Years dinner with the family, our waitress Kiana, made it even more special, she was very attentive and helpful in explaining the different dishes. We did the family menu and will for sure do that again, everything very tasty and just perfect, my favorite the Tuscan Chicken and Shrimp, loved the atmosphere great service,  can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"we recently went here for lunch.The food was awesome and delicious.Our waiter was courteous and extremely efficient. Portions and drinks were huge.Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, no pics of the food.   This is going to be short.   Excellent food.   The staff was great.   A couple of points here.

1.  Right on top of special diet needs.
2. Staff, ALL of the staff worked great together.  Outstanding team work."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was delicious!

I was staying in Vegas and got tired of eating at the casinos so my friend and I drove around looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for Maggiano's.  He had been to one in LA before so we gave this one a try.  We were seated right away and, being the klutz that I normally am, I spilled my water all over the table.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it (aka he teased me).  He brought us bread right away and when I spilled water on that, he brought us another basket without us having to ask! 

I ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni.  We both loved our meals but I think I filled up on bread so I couldn't finish.  We didn't have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didn't take home any leftovers; our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food.  I usually don't like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly (I find that with pasta, the shrimp is often overcooked).  

The decor was excellent and everything looked very clean.  I didn't expect much from a restaurant on the second floor of a mall but it was amazing.  I will definitely try and come back here."}
{"text":"This place to me is so good. I often visit this place maybe once a month. Walking up you would not think the inside would be as nice as it is. My favorite thing on the menu is .....well everything and to be honest i don't think i have ever ran across something that i didn't like. Oh yeah and the mariana sauce is so addictive i buy a jar at least every other month, and i cant cook lol. Also they do have a reception hall that most people don't know about and they have a planner and everything. The staff is so nice and i think they know my face by now lol...."}
{"text":"Check out the image that I posted for this restaurant! Their food is amazing, the staff is super friendly, and the service was really fast too.

If you like Italian, do not miss out on this restaurant. And a personal turn on for me is when restaurants have (GOOD) olive oil on the table for you, and Maggiano's sure does have amazing olive oil :p 

The location of this restaurant is kinda cool too, because it's right above the mall so you can go shopping after eating if you need anything. 

5 Stars with no doubt"}
{"text":"First time at Maggiano's... went for an Anniversary dinner for a special couple.  When I made the reservations, I let the person on the phone know that the occasion was for an Anniversary.  When we arrived and was seated to our table, the table was wonderfully decorated with sparkling stars throughout and a \"Happy Anniversary\" postcard was displayed and signed by all the staff.  This was a wonderful surprise, as I had not given any specific direction to do so. The environment was just what I was looking for, the food was outstanding and the service was great.  When dessert time came along, the server brought out a plate of lemon cookies, with a strawberry in the middle of the plate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate.. this was also a pleasant surprise since I did not request this thoughtful gesture.  I truly appreciated the 'extra' touches that came with our visit, without even asking. This truly made the evening even more special. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  I look forward to my next visit with and without friends. 
THANK YOU MAGGIANO'S !"}
{"text":"My family and a friend met up at Maggiano's in Fashion Show and I'm experiencing mixed feelings about it. 

Locations: Great place to meet but mall closes before the restaurant. It makes the underground parking difficult to access. Consider using the valet. 

Service: Our server was very nice but she also presented the olive oil/balsamic vinegar plate in front of my four year old. It was a very messy spill. 

Food: Pretty good overall. The fried zucchini appetizer is always good. My friends chicken salad looked fine and my pepperoni flat bread was not interesting in the slightest. 

Summary: I'll go back if encouraged but great Italian food is easy to come by in Las Vegas. I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"The first time I was taken to Maggiano's it was for the family-style dinner. It was REALLY good. And I couldn't believe that the dishes keep coming. It's a glutton's dream come true. I had the house salad, which was pretty good. The calamari is excellent, as are the pasta dishes. I didn't particularly care for the red clam sauce though. 

This is THE place to go to if you want to take your family out for dinner, or even a group date night. The family-style dinner is very worth it, in my opinion. You get to take home what you dont finish, and it's usually a lot. 

Ending on a sweet note: the cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food and very reasonably priced for Italian!! Portions are big & you never leave feeling hungry. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fred was our server, he was great. He gave us a dessert for our anniversary. He seemed pretty slammed server wise but made sure to always refill our wine and ask about our food. We had a reservation and they were super busy but made sure to get us in in less than a minute and gave us a big booth. The salmon dish with the asparagus, sundried tomatoes and garlic cream sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch recently.  The pasta was a touch over-cooked, but adequate.  The service was adequate.  The sauces were adequate.  I guess I'd have to call this place perfectly adequate."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open in Downtown Summerlin ever since we saw the sign go up.  My opinion, it is better than the one in the Fashion Show Mall, food and service wise.  
We love this place and its easy to see why.  The food is spectacular!!!  You must try the mushroom ravioli. It is to die for!!  Our server is completely overall the star server of this place.  Silvia (the Italian one) has a great sense of humor and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  She pretty much gave us the breakdown of every item on the menu that we were curious about.  We had no idea about the \"Chef's gift\" and explained it to us to a tee.  I gave my wife a bite of my mushroom ravioli and she loved it so much that Silvia volunteered to switch the \"Chef's gift\" even after we were ready to leave, so my wife could enjoy her own dish the next day. 
I would completely recommend asking for Silvia to be your server and you would not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great corporate Italian atmosphere.. Very attentive staff clean environment and food okay.. def a must try and be back soon.!'"}
{"text":"So far it hasn't been bad got here about 520 pm (2ppl) they said it will be a 15/20 min wait at 35 min I asked how long more (as the crowds started to come) they looked at the computer as were like we will sit you now. (Hmm maybe forgot about me not a big deal) they took care of me they sit us outside by ourself (again not so bad the weather was awesome) wait staff our first served was very distant (because we refused drinks and went with water and no appetizer as I want dessert ) then we got another server and he was awesome super friendly brought me a straw (that I asked previous server twice for) I got vegetable primevera and it lacked flavor I had to add salt and cheese also not enough vegetables for something being named vegetable. Most of my pasta was clumped together but not mushy! My boyfriends spaghetti and meatballs was good."}
{"text":"It's located right in front of the Southpark Mall.

This was my first time, and they seam to really want you please their customers. The chef came over and helped create something I would enjoy eating. They also had an after meal appreciation, where the general manager personally thanked us for coming in. He also gave us an envelope with a thank you and please come again with a free dessert coupon.

With all that said, I probably won't go again unless I'm at the mall, and starving!! The flavors and atmosphere really didn't add up for me or my friend. 

·The Rolls- nice flavor. I thought just the oil seamed cheep with no seasoning or anything. I requested butter that was pretty good, but there were only 4 little squares of butter dropped on a plate like it was a complete afterthought. 


I got the..
·Make your own pasta- Rigatoni with non spicy vodka sauce and side of buffalo mozzarella - This was pretty good tasting. It was very soupy. I had to lift each piece to let it drain before reading it.

My friend got..
·Carbonara- It was only pretty good! Not authentic."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited a Maggiano's.   I will say the inside is still very warm and inviting.  The bright side was our waitress.  She was extremely friendly and very engaging with the family.  She made recommendations with a little compare and contrast, pointed out some way to try new things without adding any cost.

The food was good.  We did send one plate back (seasonal special).  The person that ordered it was not real pleased with it.  The waitress took it, told the wife that she should not eat what she did not like and to not feel bad about it.  They replaced it with something else and the wife was happy.

I think my only two issues are, they were out of their spinach salad (Fri at around 6:00 p.m.).  I find this to just be poor management in the kitchen.  And the process are a little on the high side for what you are getting.  That is not to say the food is not good, because it is.  But at about 25 - 30 dollars a head, I would expect just a bit more.  

All of that being said, it is a great place for a large group and or the family.  I believe there are specials out in the bar area and the staff work their butts off to keep you smiling."}
{"text":"I'm giving my rating on service and some of the food. We went with a group of people for a birthday party and right off the bat it started off terribly. We got to the restaurant about 10 minutes early and were told we were way to early for our reservation and was asked to clean me back when it was our time. So we ended up waiting in the restaurant at the barstool area. So when it came time to sit down we were stopped as they didn't put chairs at the table and waited for them to put them out. When we actually got to sit down we had our drink order taken. That seemed to go smoothly, but as soon as it came for the first round of appetizers there was no room to set them down so they took them away. 20-30 minutes went by before they brought them back out and they were the same ones and they were cold. The salad was really good no complaints there. Then the entrees came and we are but they missed an item or so. When he told his manager about the issue the manager was a utter and complete weasel. Did not try to fix it just come out and go around the problem. For my first time here. I will not be back."}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, this is one of my favorites. This particular location is awesome too, and I suspect because of it's primo Las Vegas Strip location, they are all trained to wow you with their service.

I took the wife and kid here, and I was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables. This location seemed just a tad upper class, but alas we were hungry wolfpack. And I spotted a smattering of kids here so I didn't feel as bad later.

Ordered the bruschetta, shrimp scampi, and classic spaghetti meatballs. All dishes were excellent,  esp the scampi. No complaints here. The bruschetta was super tasty, the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like I was in Tuscany. Haha. Too much? Yeah.

Service was amazing. I didn't get the guys name but it was perfect. Friendly, but not fake, attentive, but not pyscho. Deserving of his 25% tip...only in Vegas right?

Anyway, if you got an urge for Italian but don't want snotty service at a Michelen joint, come here."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi I've ever had! Cooked perfectly and in a vodka sauce that was to die for. Service was friendly and quick. Decor was intimate-- perfect for a romantic dinner. I will come back every time I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Host and Manager have very poor customer service!! Never going back. Food was not worth the wait.
We had a reservation but still waited for almost 1hour because the host didnt want to do her so called job! Rude, bossy, clueless & no class; thats including their manager!
Not worth it! Wouldnt even give a star if it wasnt required!
Worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"Shared our orders with other people so I got to taste a number of dishes.  Caesar salad was your run of the mill Caesar salad. Could not discern any anchovy flavor which is the hallmark of a good Caesar dressing.
Calamari appetizer was nicely fried, not greasy, but not tasty enough.  I think it needed to be browned more. The sauce that came with it was tasty. Also had fried zucchini, (again not greasy) but was heavy on the breadcrumbs.  That happened because the zucchini was cut the long way instead of in sticks and the heavy breading overwhelmed the thin, flat piece of zucchini.  Nothing I would order again. 
I tasted my dining companions tilapia. He commented that a little garlic would have enhanced the flavors.  But I will say that it was perfectly cooked.  Eggplant parmigiana suffered from \"rawness\" from the taste of the breadcrumbs. You could taste the uncooked breadcrumbs in the middle.  I am an eggplant lover and I had no more than a super thin slice of it.  The eggplant has to be fried enough to give the breading a cooked flavor.  It tasted as if breadcrumbs were just added at the end right out of the container.  Spaghetti with sausage was fine, but nothing that I wanted to spend calories on.  The baked rigatoni had meatballs in it which were tasty but had the consistency of hockey pucks.  Too hard.  If you are going to bake meatballs in a dish of pasta, you can't put fully cooked meatballs in the dish.  They have to be partially cooked so that the baking finishes them off.  
The winners of the evening were the desserts!  AMAZING tiramisu!  Light and not too sweet.  Just perfection.  I tasted my dining companion's cheesecake and I couldn't decide which was better the tiramisu or the cheesecake.  The cheesecake was light and fluffy as if they used ricotta cheese in it.  At the end of the meal I was happy to have experienced such wonderful desserts.  
The two stars are for the cheesecake and tiramisu.  
I won't mind going back just to eat their desserts.  There are better  italian restaurants in the valley especially if you want to experience really authentic italian dishes."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service were great; however the food was just average. 

Lobster carbonara tasted like what you would expect from the Olive Garden.
Italian sausage flat bread was ok as well.

There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that I would try again."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on a Wednesday night and we were seated within three minutes. Very beautiful restaurant and glad they brought it off the strip! We were seated and greeted by our server, Arlouh was our server and she was wonderful. After advising I had a peanut allergy, the chef came out to speak to me to see if I had any questions. That was such a great touch where in fine dining I had not had that happen to me before. Arlouh was attentive and recommended the dinner for two which gave us a free entree! I had the braised beef and the sausage gnocchi .. yum! Did not disappoint.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. I was able to make a reservation through Yelp while we were driving there.  The decor was beautiful with linen tablecloths and napkins.  There was great soft Italian music playing in the background.  Our table was stocked with our own grated parmesan cheese and olive oil.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We were really surprised at how fast the food came.  I had the roasted chicken, which was cooked perfectly, with crispy red potatoes, best ever!  My husband and mother in law (who are both Italian) had the eggplant parmesan which they both raved about.  They also have family portions that are very reasonable.  The price was a little bit more than the Olive Garden but it was so worth it.  Especially, when the waiter cleared our dishes and said that since the eggplant parmesan was a classic pasta dish, we would get 2 more to take home.  So, 3 of us ate for $65 and we took home lunch for the next day.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Had a party of nine to celebrate a wedding.  The staff was very attentive and helpful.  The food was great."}
{"text":"Food overload!  Both of our meals were perfect and I still think they make the best lasagne I have ever had.  Then you get to take the same order home with you!  Portion sizes were huge and all that at a very reasonable price.  
Our server was great and we lacked for nothing as she anticipated most everything we would have asked for.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"So glad we have a Maggiano's in downtown summerlin. Perfect for locals.. food rocks and service is awesome too.. I think the wine and food menu is better than the one in fashion show mall. We had a bottle of prosecco for $30! Their meal for 2 for $42.95 is a steal deal!! We got an appetizer, 2 pastas and a dessert of your choice and it also includes 2 pastas to go!! Portions are family style, highly recommend mushroom ravioli al forno, braised beef pasta, bruschetta bar. Great desserts, butter cake and tiramisu. Our server Zo was AMAZING. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Umm Umm Good, for a chain, Beachwood Place is one of my favorite malls, and Im not a mall kinda guy. But Maggianos, you will not be disappointed, plus you get a free pasta to take home. Luv it!!
Three cheese ravioli, spectacular!
The pound cake desert doesn't sound great but it is!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was great.  We had the happy hour flatbread and beers which were excellent.  It was probably the best meal so far on our Vegas trip.  The pasta dishes were also wonderful as well as the service.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my new hot spot to feed a crowd when thinking Italian! I was blown away with their family style menu. The minimum requirement for four or more at $32.95 per head is an unbeatable price for what you get and it's bottomless! Refill for our group need not apply. The huge portions given were incredible! We came in with a party of 8 to celebrate the holiday season from work. Here's the rundown of what we ordered:

Compliments of the Chef Italian Antipasti -  Amazing way to start our meal! 

Choose 1 Salad - Chopped Salad was crispy, refreshing, and an excellent choice!

Choose 1 appetizer (7 options) - Stuffed mushrooms were huge and tasty!

Choose 2 pasta (19 options) - Linguine and Clams and Tuscany Shrimp and Chicken. Both pasta were cooked al dente and had wonderful flavor. The meat portions were generous!

Choose 2 Signature Cuts (11 options) - Veal Parmesan and Grilled Salmon Lemon and Herb. These dishes were cooked perfectly. The Veal Parmesan was lightly coated with breading without being overcooked. Grilled salmon with lemon and herb was absolutely delicious! It was garnished with spinach. 

Choose two desserts (10 options) - Apple Crostada and Chocolate Zuccotto Bites. The Apple Crostada was served warm with ice cream on top. This reminded me of an apple pie. Super good with a light crunch! The Chocolate Zuccotto Bites remind me of truffles but not as rich.

I can't emphasize enough how much this place impressed me and my friends. Starting from the reservation request made, the amazing food served, and our server Erin who definitely has people skills! She was very accommodating and always had a smile on her face every time we needed assistance.

This location is an absolute return versus the other location at Fashion Mall where they cater more to tourists than locals. And by being not too far from home, this place hits a home run all around!"}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD* (and I'm Italian!)

Every time my girlfriends and I visited Las Vegas we would come here at least twice (over a week holiday) to have dinner. I love that the restaurant serves up food family style (read: larger portions meant to be shared among family and/or friends) which is how Italian people serve their meals at home to their own families. 

The food is authentic, delicious and the servers always know their s***. I usually go for appetizers (caprese, zucchini fritte, mozzerella marinara)  and a main (ravioli, eggplant parmesan, manicotti). One of my friends always raves about the baked ziti. 

One of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta  (from a list) with a choice of sauce for an extra 1 or 2$. We used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch. Cheap (sweet, more shopping!) and delicious!!!! I even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once. 

*Obviously not counting my relatives home-made Italian cooking. And the food is on par with the food served at Terroni in Toronto, Canada."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday. First time here, our server was real nice and explained well the menu. The food was great and my husband loved the bread (he kept asking for more) :) 

There was also this gentleman providing entertainment and he sang happy birthday to my husband. 

It was a lovely evening."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and has a really great vibe. After being seated we waited for quite sometime without any service, when Johnny passed by to see if we had been helped. Johnny is amazing! He gave us the best customer service and made sure we were taken care of the rest of our meal. He spoke to his manager who was also amazing, she comped our appetizer and dessert. Me and my boyfriend had a great experience, and will certainly return."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here.  My mother and law came here for lunch,  our server Jose was almost never to be found nor was he ever at other tables.  Another server was helping us out a good chunk of the time. But then at the end of the meal when he dropped the check he made an inappropriate comment to my mother in law!  I will not be coming back to this location any time in the future."}
{"text":"Barely edible entree. Sadly I can't undo the meal I had here. I ordered the Tuscan Shrimp and Chicken dish that comes with a base red pepper cream sauce. Thank goodness for the bread and spinach artichoke dip appetizer we had before the entree because I had maybe 3 bites of the massive portion. The pasta was extremely dry, barely having any cream sauce at all and lacking in seasoning and flavors. Very tough to eat. My entree alone was rather pricey and we honestly have made better pasta at home in the past. I wasn't super impressed with our service either but I'll simply leave it at that since we don't plan on returning. We chose this place out of hunger after an event at the mall but save your tastebuds & your wallet and choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food but as soon as I looked up the ceiling I was aghast how the dust and dirt accumulated (see attached photo) on the ceiling tiles.  If you're paying for an expensive brunch or dinner you should expect not just the food to be clean but as well as the place where you will eat it.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"First time trying out this Italian restaurant! They had awesome service and started off with warm bread and olive oil and balsamic. They weren't stingy with how many pieces of bread they gave us! I had the seafood pasta and asked for no mussels or clams and they stuffed it with more shrimp and lobster. They aren't stingy with their portions!"}
{"text":"Truly below average food. Nice ambiance, very noisy. Side of asparagus: thin, reed like asparagus heavily salted and grilled. Pasta was fair, chicken and ricotta meatballs had potential but over salted. 
Spouse had shrimp scampi. The shrimp were small and not fresh. Flavorless, didn't taste any garlic, more pepper. Daughters spaghetti was fine. Service was fine.  Were told we had a 1/2 hour wait. Buzzer buzzed 75 minutes later. Formulaic, poorly executed Italian food that people seem to queue for. I'm puzzled. At least Olive Garden has good breadsticks. Avoid."}
{"text":"While not usually a fan of Italian food, I've been in the mood lately, and Maggiano's hit the spot.  The portion sizes are ridiculously amazing, and for that alone, I give it 4 stars.  

The ZUCCHINI FRITTE consisted of long, fairly thin slices of zucchini, breaded in panko, fried and served with a lemon aioli.  Although I personally thought it needed a little salt, the overall execution was great.  Very crispy zucchini and the aoili was just the right dipping sauce.  I even enjoyed the provided lemon wedge, which I squeezed over the dish.  

However, I would not have ordered an appetizer had I known how enormous the entree portions are.  Sister ordered the CHICKEN FLORENTINE, which came with 2 thick chicken breasts, breaded and pan-fried, and stuffed with spinach and cheese or some sort of cream sauce.  It was served with a side of angel hair pasta and alfredo/cream sauce.  Overall way too much to eat in one serving, but she found it delicious and was happy to have the leftovers.  The chicken appeared to be well executed and not at all dry.

The FOUR CHEESE RAVIOLI was stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and cream cheese.  Despite sounding nice, it was bland.  I didn't specifically ask if the pasta was made in-house, but the awnings outside say \"homemade pasta.\"   After tasting this ravioli, I'm fairly certain it's not fresh or made in-house.  The saving grace for this dish was the pesto alfredo sauce.  Alfredo can often be one-note and boring, but the addition of the pesto made this flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I really wanted a spoon to eat it like soup.  As nice as the pesto alfredo is, it's so rich that it could be cloying if it weren't for the small pour of red sauce over the top.  The red sauce added a sweetness and acidity needed to balance out the creamy richness of the alfredo.  

The best part of the meal occured when I ordered my pasta and the server asked which SECONDARY PASTA I WANTED TO TAKE HOME WITH ME.  What?  I was seriously confused.  So for $14, I got 2 full-sized pasta meals.  Amazing.  For that, I will be back."}
{"text":"Decent food. Nothing special at all. But on pasta dishes and some others its buy one get one. So you will see a lot of people here for the bargain."}
{"text":"Death by salt.

I had salmon Oscar. 
I love salmon asparagus and crabmeat. 
But when it's salted so much all I taste is salt. 
Wife had eggplant parmesan.
It was mostly spaghetti. She had to pick through the spaghetti  to find thin , chopped up strips of eggplant. 

You'd think fir the prices.  And I usually ignore price. 
You'd get a large chunk of eggplant. 
( since that's what the fish is named after)

I've only said this once before ever. 

Not going back.

What a let down.

Fantastic service
Great atmosphere
Good food , albeit salty. 

I thought the experience was 4.5 stars. 
.5 subtracted for salty food.

It's pretty salty.

But I'd go again.

Desert sampler to go 
Great on the sofa with the spouse at the end of the day."}
{"text":"I fail to understand what folks like about this place other than it's reasonably priced, the quantities are very plentiful, and the ambiance is likely better than any other similar place. I guess another plus is it's designed for sharing. Bring a group and pass the serving platters around to try some of everything!

My issue is the food. It just isn't particularly flavorful or interesting. I mean, the dishes have sufficient salt but otherwise, they seem flat. The pasta is consistently over-cooked without a hint of al dente. Also, it is very far from authentic but the name of the restaurant contains \"Little Italy\" which signifies American Italian rather than Italian Italian. You've been warned. 

The service, on the other hand, is always on point with friendly and professional wait-staff. 

I'm glad I went to the bar first. We were served some strong drinks which helped the rest of the evening!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The only thing that keeps this a four star review is that our waiter is never around. We were seated at the patio (nice outdoor area overlooking the entrance of the mall) and after putting down our menus he didn't return. Eventually one of the hostess took our order for us. Our food eventually came but we were not given any utensils, and our water was not refilled throughout our meal. 

That aside, the food is very delicious and reasonably priced. I love their pasta and they have cheap pasta options or nicer seafood pasta options. I'm a big fan of cheese so the I love the meal here. Arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much!"}
{"text":"Horribly sad We have been going to Maggianos in the Chicagoland area since 1998 the Scottsdale location gets worse and worse it is almost unbelievable that the management allows such poor food quality.. We dined on a free meal due to a very bad meal the last time I would not eat here ever Again.... Free was even a wast of time and energy on this meal tonight the chicken Marsala was chewy tough and a joke tasting liked canned Marsala sauce. The eggplant parmigiana was old and reheated and dry like pieces of leather."}
{"text":"II have a gluten problem and have celiac disease i have been to this restraunt several times over 25 times.The food is very good.However if you have an allergy or a gluten problem i can no longer suggest  this restraunt.The last 2 out of 4 times i had eaten there they brought me out my salad with croutins in the salad which some of you who have the problem becomes a big problem. Thank god i caught this before i ate it. I ordered my meal through the chef per usual 2 times they brought me out items that have gluten out of the last 4 times i ate there.The problem is they have no checking sytem there.A diffrent waiter brings out your food .They have no idea whats going on.The margin for era is to great.They say they accomodate allergies and gluten free. The problem is the caring level is not there anymore in this place.Note both times this happened at the restraunt it was not a weekend or that busy.So that excuse is down the drain.My question to the manger was what if this was a child that had a serius allergy and went into shock.Then what.He said it never happens.My response funny to me i was here 3 weeks ago and the same thing happened. there was no response."}
{"text":"Is this a joke? I literally eat the single worst shrimp scampi dish I have ever had in my life. I then asked for a pasta dish with chicken. The sauce was terrible and the chicken was very rough. In addition the pasta was still a bit undercooked. Awful."}
{"text":"Came in on 1/13/16  and the service was AMAZING! As we walked in there was a crowd of people,and there were two hostess at one computer and they had crowd control on lock! There were two gentlemen(managers maybe?) who assisting the lovely hostes(she had glasses,dark hair,handled everything calmy but quickly and sat us next to a window like we requested.SUPER friendly) moved rather quickly! Nice seeing management help out! 
Our server was nice, gave run through of menu, gave suggestions. We've been maggianos before and other locations and vegas takes #1! Food and Host staff were great!!"}
{"text":"Just snagged a table-top booth because the wait was fairly long, but the waiter was cool and he stayed up on my needy drink demands. Ordered up a couple crab cakes and a couple drinks. Easily split crab cakes and a side salad with girlfriend and could still muster up walking around the mall. Cool place."}
{"text":"I've heard about Maggiano's for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when I was in Vegas for business.  Since there were 7 of us, we decided to order family style...  $31 a head and we choose two appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, and two desserts, all you can eat!

We ordered the calamari and mussels, chopped and Italian salad, spaghetti and meatballs and linguine with clams (white sauce) the chicken marsala and tilapia, and the tiramisu and s'mores special dessert.  Calamari was great, but I was a little disappointed in the mussels.  Too many white beans in the mix for me.  The salads were good.  Linguine was good and the meatballs on the spaghetti were HUGE! The tilapia wasn't too fishy and was nice and moist and we LOVED the chicken marsala.  Both desserts were great as well.

Big points for our waiter, Noel, as well.  He was very helpful, professional, and attentive through our stay.  He encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in.  The spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day, as well as the desserts!"}
{"text":"First the good: Generally was very pleasant, the wait staff was very efficient and friendly. I'm a fan of Caesar salad and eggplant parmigiana. The Caesar salad lettuce was room temperature, I have a preference for it to be slightly chilled. Otherwise the I found Caesar to be unremarkable. The pasta was slightly al dente, which I happen to prefer. It was fine.

Needs improvement and recommendations: The eggplant was rather over breaded and somewhat tired, and tasteless. They also include a second portion of eggplant ( a standing: buy one, get one to take home deal). I recommend that they eliminate the free portion and focus on making the primary portion fresh. Having said this, I'm sure the homeless I gave the second helping, appreciated a warm meal.

I will probably give them one more try since they are a neighborhood restaurant, perhaps a chicken piccata next time."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in Las Vegas I would go to Maggiano's.  Everything is great and when my wife and I are there for a Marathon we eat pasta."}
{"text":"Considering this Italian restaurant is a chain restaurant I was pleasantly surprised with the food. Make reservations."}
{"text":"My family flocks to this place like cattle to a watering hole on a hot day.  Theres usually 8 to 10 of us in a group and the service is always fantastic regardless of how busy they are.  From Salads to Entres everything is fresh with modest portions.  The atmosphere is very nice, casual dress not stuffy just a little noisy at times.  I would have rated this place a 5 star if the food had just a little more of a WOW factor that can only be found in an authentic mom and pops italian restaurant kinda like those found in New Yorks Little Italy.  Prices are reasonable. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here with my family while vacationing in Phoenix. The  service was top notch. The waitress was very attentive no provided exceptional service. The food was also very good. My wife had the Fettuccine Alfredo and loved it. My sons had the Spaghetti and Meatball. I have to say the meatball was very flavorful (I kept sampling my sons). Now I limit my pasta intake so I had their Center Cut Filet. The steak was perfectly cooked and was very tasty. 

With my wife's Fettuccine dish, you were also given a meal to take home. Currently the Lasagne is sitting in our cooler as we are driving home. I know my boys will eat it. Kinda nice to get that as well.

Sadly I skipped desert, next time I am in town I'll have to go back and try that too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend lunch here with my daughter and son-in-law.  The view is awesome, and delicious food.  They had a photographer to capture the moment at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a great restaurant. I'm from Chicago and have eaten at Maggiano's on several occassions with Family, Friends, Church outings, etc..
I Love PASTA and Maggiano's does pasta right.
NOTE: At this location I went to meet some business associates and arrived early (30minutes prior to meeting) and sat at the bar which is right when you walk in. I found it very hard for me to obtain a greeting, be offered a water, be offered a menu, etc.. Mind you there was 6 ppl in the bar area all standing around and drinking and I was the ONLY person seated. I am not the one to EVER make mention of the race card as I'm from the North and it's not as practical as it is in the South. This area is a very nice area and I actually have a guest house in the area, however as a young business professional of my race I am looked over at times which don't deter my mission or success it's just disappointing that people are still stuck in the early 1900's and don't feel that my race is successful.
After several attempts to get the bartender to even come to where I was, I had one of the individuals who I decided to mingle with (very nice group) sit next to me and he asked what I was drinking and IMMEDIATELY the bartender came down to my seat and AGAIN didn't look at me he looked at the individual who directed him to get the order from me. He then took a deep breath and I greeted him with a SMILE as I am a professional and ordered my cocktail (I did watch him closely while making it as I don't want no Seely from The Color Purple mess, LoL)..
Overall I LOVE Maggiano's Food however this location isn't ideal for me.."}
{"text":"the staff and service where decent 
what really really lacked was the food it's self
maybe growing next to little italy in nyc has me spoiled because that food is cooked by real Italians"}
{"text":"It sounds weird, but growing up in an Italian household, you'd think I'd love going out for Italian food, right?  Quite the contrary.  I guess I had too much as a kid, so I usually bypass Italian restaurants to choose other ethnicities or flavors.  

I had my first experience at a Maggiano's at this particular Charlotte one.  First, the entrance and decor of this uncharacteristically chain Italian restaurant makes you think you're walking into a fine dining establishment, but being that it's in a mall, it was casual (although not overly; don't go dressed there in your cut-offs (do they still make those?) and tank top).  I was with a very large group (about 20 people), so we had a huge table in the middle of the room and tried their Family Style Dinner choices.  I was neither ordering nor paying, so I went along with whatever was selected.  I must admit that I did not have a single bad thing and nothing tasted typically Italian or \"chain-y.\"  Plus, I got to sample so many things that my taste buds were alive and kicking.   Everything was so wonderful (of course, the red wine helped!) and I had to change my opinion a bit about Italian restaurants...especially this one.  

I've returned to Maggiano's since then, this time with family visiting from out of town.  We had originally tried to go to the Cheesecake Factory next door, but the wait was two hours long.  We walked into Maggiano's and, seeing that it was very crowded as well, were pleasantly surprised that we were seated within 10 minutes.  This time, we ordered individual entrees instead of the shared plates.  I tried the delicious Chicken Pesto Linguine which was full of chicken and pesto flavor.  

I'm definitely a fan of Maggiano's and recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional and unusual Italian dinner experience, even those not into chain restaurants."}
{"text":"When I'm craving Italian, Maggiano's is my favorite place to go! Last night the restaurant was super busy and we arrived very early for our reservation. Luckily, the bar is open seating and we were able to get a hightop table. Usually I skip the bread on the table but I was starving, so I had a piece. It was very good and I didn't put anything on it.

We started with the Mozzarella Marinara for an appetizer. I used to love it but last night it tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up in a microwave. (not a good taste!) It came out about five minutes after we ordered it...so I'm not sure how it was prepared.

For dinner, I ordered chicken parmigiana and it was delicious, as always! It comes with two large pieces of chicken and a side of spaghetti. For dessert, I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. I ate it the next day and it wasn't the best I've had...but it wasn't bad. Overall, we had a nice experience. If you're a tourist and want yummy food with a good view, request a seat by the window!"}
{"text":"calamari = bomb
stuffed mushrooms = bomb
veal parmesan = solid
lasagna = pretty interesting taste... has an italian sausage kick to it
waiter was cool and made good suggestions as well"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, and wasn't disappointed.  I got the chicken piccata (loved it!) and hubby got the lobster carbonara (fantastic!).  Bread was nice & fresh, all soft & yummy inside the crispy exterior, but the side salads were rather boring.  Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Delicious, the service was amazing.  The chef even came out to discuss the menu and our needs.  Karen said her linguine with clams was amazing.  My vegetable penne was flavorful.  Best meal we've had since coming to vegas."}
{"text":"An average PF Chang, Cheesecake Factory quality chain restaurant located at the very fashionable Fashion Show Mall.  For Vegas, this might be 5-star but for me it is only 3.  Sorry.

Bring your appetite -- portions are buffet style."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is our restaurant of choice when we are feeling completely indecisive. We always know we are going to get a good meal here. The place is huge, but we usually opt to sit at the bar. They have a couple of TV's so if you want to catch the game and enjoy finer dining than a sports bar, this is a good spot. Great wine selection (offer 6oz and 9oz glasses) and they have some delightful NA beverages as well. I'm a sucker for their eggplant parmesan and the fact you get to take one home with you as well...amazing! They always have a seasonal menu in addition to some lighter fare options (probably should go that route sometime). We have always received top-notch service. Two thumbs up for Maggiano's for being consistently delicious."}
{"text":"We took our daughter to Maggiano's for her birthday dinner. It was confusing to find and we never did find the front door:) we started with the brushetta which was nice. The fresh warm rolls were delish. I ordered the cheese ravioli fritte and it was very good. My husbands pasta carbonara with lobster tasted so/so. It was pretty busy and we had a late dinner. I had the chocolate cake for dessert and it was a huge serving and very good. Overall it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The portions are very generous, well worth the price.

My fiancé and I ordered the Caesar salad and Four
Cheese ravioli to share. The food was savory and appetizing!

Great restaurant for a date! Food and service were up to par! We would definitely recommend as a wonderful place for large and tasty portions with awesome service!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Nothing mind blowing, but a solid Italian meal. Kind of similar in quality to Bucca di Beppo.

We would go back."}
{"text":"Had a gift card here to take the wifey.  There is nothing too extravagant about this place, but the food is decent and the scenery and ambience made me feel like we were in Italy.  Therefore, it would be a good date night, but I would not come back again.  Their deal of ordering an entree and getting to take one back home is pretty awesome though.  I have not heard of anything like this before.  It is in a nice spot in Scottsdale, therefore, there are some things to do after or beforehand."}
{"text":"We came here for a private party and tried to order a Rye Manhattan and the idiot server said \" like rye bread? \" forget this place, including the dishwater pasta."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here and was seated with no problem; but then again there was no wait. Service was pretty good, my girlfriend and I came as a short last dinner before heading back to reality. I would give our server a solid B+/A- considering menu explanation, time it took to get his attention, he remembered my to-go order, and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting.

We had:
-Side spinach salad with gorgonzola cheese: pretty yummy, I am a fan of gorgonzola but I think huge chunks were a little much, even for me. Dressing was a little heavy.
-Linguine & Clam: good broth in the pasta, healthy amount of clams
-Peppercorn steak w/ the Maggiano's sauce which was carmelized onion and such: so yummy; a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good.

Do want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic \"buy one take one home\" menu options that are available at a lot of other chains, though."}
{"text":"We went for lunch/brunch on Sunday.   The food was excellent.   We would definately go back.   Service was excellent.    The waiter was very attentive and gave good recommendations"}
{"text":"You will love this place! There Maggiano's salad for two os awesome. We never ever have a bad meal here. The owner Teri is very personable and treats you like royalty."}
{"text":"Came here on a date with my girlfriend at the Fashion Mall and split a salmon dinner and salad. Big serving and the salmon was served hot. The sauce was extremely good. Prices are a little on the high side, but with the quality of the food, and the beautiful location (overlooking Las Vegas Blvd.), it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very good !! This was our 4th visit and the service was amazing!! We had a party of seven for a birthday party !! The food was good and the table was right in the corner over looking the strip !! We had the stuffed mushrooms, Linguine di Mare , Caesar salad and Peroni Beer with Red wine !! Very yummy !!"}
{"text":"Very good food in a beautiful restaurant. Although this is a chair out of Chicago, their food is very good. They offer a large menu, including homemade pasta. They also offer several pasta selection with a buy one, take one home for another day. There Italian bread is hot and fresh, served with flavorful olive oil. The salads are also very good, either as a side salad, or, an entree. We never have room for desert, so cannot rate those. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly..."}
{"text":"A very pleasant restaurant, Maggiano's had very food food at a medium to high price range.  The steak I ordered was cooked exactly to my request which 9.75 times out of 10 doesn't happen.  Our waiter did seem to push for us to order more food than we wanted though."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, call make a reservation and request Breyetta Elam as your Server. She is talented, beautiful, smart and funny! Then make sure to have a Bruschetta, House Salad, Shrimp Scampi and finish with an Apple Crostada. Maybe even a house wine or my favorite Peach/Raspberry Tea!
This is an excellent restaurant for a date night, family outing, corporate gathering or private celebration! The food and service are always excellent!"}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas, go to Maggiano's! Their food is amazing and their service excellent! Make sure to make a reservation, otherwise your waiting time for a table can be very long. In total, I visited Maggiano's at least 10 times, and was never disappointed by their food, or their service. The waiters have an eye for detail and do everything they can to make you happy! The one waiter who really stood out so far was Hector - he should really get a raise :) 
Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"First time we are here it was a private event in the secret back rooms and it was incredible. So we've been meaning to come back and try it out as a regular punter. WOW. 

Fred was our server and he was the kindest looking person and a true gent. If the management actually read these things then please praise him from us and our team. We love him. 

So. 

Salads are STRONG here and we are large tattooed bearded meat eating machines, so trust us. These are mega. 

Lasagne. Hands down. Best lasagne we've all ever eaten and that's a promise. We eat ALOT of lasagne but this was insane. A little rich but we like that. Meaty, saucy, and sweet. How we like a chics . 

Love this place. Much love"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of weeks ago for dinner with my husband and my mother who was in from out of town. We shop at the South Park Mall frequently, but we had never been to Maggiano's before and decided to give it a try. We had 6:00pm reservations on a Wednesday for our party of three, but my mom's plane was late arriving at the Charlotte airport, so I called the restaurant and changed the time with no problem whatsoever. They were polite and accommodating. 

Parking was a bit odd. There was a large, roped off section of the parking lot for valet restaurant parking... not a single car was parked there, but this area took up most of the close, available parking, and we ended up having to park the the garage. I didn't see anyone from the restaurant available to valet park us had we been lazy enough to consider this option, so overall it was just a waste of parking space. Maybe on Friday/Saturday nights it makes more sense, I don't know. 

The restaurant was only about one-third filled downstairs, but for some reason we were seated at a small, rectangular table for four that was right next to what was obviously going to be a large party of 20-ish  that hadn't shown up yet. Our table was sort of crammed up next to this long table for the yet-to-arrive party, but we sat where we were directed mostly because my mom sat down before I could complain.

Our waiter was very nice, though he did mix up my wine selection with my mom's, and riesling makes me want to vomit. We switched glasses, and I survived.  The menu offered a wide variety of choices, and I settled for the special which was touted as some \"contest-winning\" lasagna with chicken and artichokes, etc. I forget what it was called. My mom had the eggplant parmesan. My husband had a steak of some sort. He liked the steak, my mom said the eggplant was \"mushy,\" and my lasagna was luke-warm and not all that flavorful. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. And it was kind of expensive for just \"okay.\"

Now on a weird note, my mom's meal qualified for a free entree to take-home. Never heard of such a thing before. She selected their lasagna (not the special that I had, but just a basic lasagna in a tomato sauce... my housekeeper said it was good when he heated it up the next day for lunch). 

About 2/3rd's of the way through our dinner, that party of 20-ish we were dreading showed up. We actually had to move our tiny table backwards so we had any room what-so-ever to maneuver once they were seated. It was a birthday party of some sort, and they were LOUD. I was happy our dinner was coming to an end at that point.

I probably won't eat here again. There are too many other restaurant options available in/around the mall."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a friend last week for lunch.  We were both nursing some pretty severe hangovers and thought bread and pasta would be the perfect cure!!!  We were so right!!!!  We both had the chicken parmigiana - as my pasta side I had the fettucine alfredo and he had penne with meat sauce.  The chicken was so good - it was crucnchy on the outside and juicy on the inside - yum.  Our waiter was very generous with the soda refills - which I desperately needed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. It is always excellent. The sausage orzo soup is a great starter, lots of stuff in it. The Rigatoni D is one of the best pasta dishes outside italy! Great atmosphere, good drink selection. My mom had the chicken and spinach manicotti with red sauce instead of white and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. We had peach-pomegranite lemonade. It was so good, we got some to go. We shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and shared the chicken Florentine. Both dishes were awesome! Our server was friendly and did not care in the least that we were not having alcohol for lunch or that we were sharing in order not to feel stuffed when we left. 

We have eaten at Maggiano's in Atlanta a couple of times and the service and food was not this good.

We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Poor Richard the bartender had to take care of so many bar area tables that he neglected his bar patrons.
Was great when we had him but he kept having to go take care of the other tables.
Chicken & spinach manicotti not bad, it would have been better with marinara sauce instead of Alfredo ...already has cheese in it!  
Gnocchi were over cooked, mushy. Sausage good.
Come back? Not as quickly for a lunch time visit."}
{"text":"It hasn't been scientifically proven; but Maggiano's may be the leading contributor to obesity in the United States. Good lord this place serves a ton of food.
It was odd that I asked the waiter how big the baked zitti was off the lunch menu. He did his best to talk me out of it by saying that it was small and not that big (a half portion as he put it). This thing was huge! Full of fresh sausage, heavy sauce and noodles that could have fed three people instead of just one. We ended up getting our meal comped by the manager after a mix-up with the bill which was great and Ill definitely return when Im in town again.
Great view too if you get a table near the glass."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many many times. I always order stuffed mushrooms and calamari for appetizers. Tonight, I decided to try the fettuccine Alfredo, it was the worst of the worst!! ,no taste , no flavor disgusting!! Very very gooey like White paste!! The sauce does not even tasted like fettuccine Alfredo sauce. My husband always get his usual the chicken Parmesan, it was Okay, but it could have been better.  I have ordered fettuccine Alfredo in many many restaurants, I even cooked fettuccine Alfredo at home many many times. It was very very disappointing for Maggianos to charge me $15.50 for this pasta dish! Not worth the money at all. But, the waitress , (Shana) she did try her best to make us happy.  I hope  they will improve their fettuccine Alfredo sauce after reading my review on Yelp."}
{"text":"**update to the below**
Have eaten at Maggiano's since my last review and my husband ordered the fra diavolo again. Turns out last time he accidentally got the \"lighter fare\" option, which is why it was so small. The regular portion is a good size. The linguine di mare is still twice the size though!


Delicious Italian food in the Fashion Show Mall on the strip. Nice setting and great service. A word of warning: the portion sizes are drastically different between entrees. Check with your server what size the entree you want is, I ended up with a massive portion and my husband's dish was tiny. 

Linguini di mare is delicious, huge, and FULL of seafood! Shrimp fra diavolo is good but small."}
{"text":"I was expecting a little more from the center cut filet. It was good but for the price could've been better. The Alfredo was delicious and the desert sampler was nice. 

This was our first time here and all is good, will be back. Just please clean the black leather in the boots after every customer. It was so dirty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great ! I love the window view, great customer service (that's always a PLUS) and delicious food"}
{"text":"Love this place lots of food and drink options.  Veal and tarimasue is amazing.  The barrel liquor at the bar pricey but well worth its robust flavor. Family seating and portions are huge with bread, salad, entrees and dessert for everyone at the table.  Customer service was exceptional been twice this is now my go to for big family gatherings.  Only thing I would have liked to see is an actual real antipasta salad sorry but the salads need to be modified very basic."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. The family loves coming here. The food is great and service is great. Only thing I don't like are the chairs and how crowded it gets. But it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Not spectacular, big decent. A lot of the dishes taste the same, but that is not a bad thing. Nice large portions! Love their chicken parmas"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about it, but I REALLY like it!! 

I've been here too many times to count!! Birthdays, Christmas Eve (more on this later), Hangovers, Shopping I mean everything!! I don't know what it is but I keep coming back!

I have been with 2 to 6 people and the most fun is with a larger group so you can do Family Style which is great because you get \"refills\" on any of the items you run low on!! Now my family and I have been for 2 Christmas Eve's and this just really works for us! It's loud enough to make me sound like I'm whispering, and same goes for my Nephews who can sometimes be on the loud side :) We order Family Style so we all have to agree on whats going to hit the table and I will say between my sisters and I we get it all figured out, the men have no say! 

Some of my favorite dishes are the Chopped salad that has Bleu cheese and avocado in it. The Tuscan Mussels are served with cannelloni beans and white wine and sun-dried tomatoes sooo good!! Next favorite the Fried Zucchini that is served with a Lemon Aioli sauce- Yum! Moving on the Baked Ziti and Beef Cannelloni are both great! For dessert I like the Pound Cake with Caramelized Bananas.

The service is whatever not over the top but not bad! They are always busy but they get you in and out!! I would definitely recommend it here even if it is a chain!!"}
{"text":"Chef's selection today was magnifico!   Portions are enough that you have enough for two more meals.   The Maggiano salad with house dressing was really good too!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and the food is tasty but today when I went in for happy hour at the bar I was shocked at the lack of professionalism displayed by the staff. They were all talking very loud and swearing while showing each other images on their phones. Not only that but the bartender girl was constantly texting on her phone rather than paying attention to her customers. I am pretty sure the manager was there and actually joined in on the locker room type of talk with his employees which was a shame. I couldn't even talk to my girlfriend because they were so loud and distracting. They also were making fun of their customers and their drink choices. All in all I would not go back here after what I saw. How does a place like this that acts like it is upper crust have a staff of unprofessional people up front? As a manager, how do you not have some rule in place that bans phones from employees while they are working? This was amateur hour and definitely not what I expected. Maybe at Olive Garden but even they have rules and their employees don't pick up their phone at any chance they get.

The flatbread was tasty. I wish I could have enjoyed it instead of listening to a flamboyant server talk about how drunk he got he night before."}
{"text":"We loved everything we got! Amazing drunken noodles, cashew chicken, and the Tom Ka Gai. Artsy, beautiful restaurant too."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner around 5 pm.

we got seated within 2 minutes

drinks and appetizers came quick, we got the
 margherita flatbread was good
stuffed mushrooms eh was not good

The entrees were huge but took 35 minutes after appetizers to come out, at this point we were full and packed most of it to go.

baked rigatoni really SALTY!!! and i didnt like the paprika in my pasta
shrimp fettecini alfredo nothing special
linguine and clams was decent

The service was average.

I would come back and get outdoor seating and just order appetizers and drinks

im still looking for a good italian place in vegas"}
{"text":"Happy hour at the bar (I ended up w/ a couple glasses of wine - nothing special but not bad for under $5 each, either) yesterday turned into \"hey, are you hungry?\" \"I could eat...\" \"well, let's see what they have...\" \"what do you see?\" [back and forth like that for a while] turned into our waitress saying \"i'll send the chef out to talk about what we can do for you.\"  

ah, the joys of #glutenfree dining. chef aiden was the consummate salesman - describing the veritable smorgasbord of options. TWO gf types of pasta, nearly all of the sauces, as well as all of the veggie sides and meats. he was detailed yet efficient, and demonstrated (separate fry oil!!!!!)  that he really cared about my party's food intolerances. i was quite impressed. we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dining experience at Maggiano's.  The Salmon Oscar was amazing! Our server, Richard, was outstanding and surprised us with dessert for our anniversary. We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving feast for those that are in Vegas on Thanksgiving Day! Maggiano's kept the Thanksgiving tradition of turkey and ham while leaving their signature Italian dishes within their prix fixe meals. To taste, the food was good but did it beat the home cooked meals? I still prefer home, but this works (especially when in Vegas!). Prix fixe approximately $50/person. All dishes came in family style. Had plenty of leftovers, but in Vegas, where would one keep the leftovers unless you're staying in a place with a fridge? For the price, it was a very nice dinner. Here's our choices: 

Turkey, stuffing, gravy- typical dish. Turkey was tender! For having to serve a packed house, we were surprised they kept the juiciness of each turkey slice. Not enough gravy though. Cranberry sauce was very sour, so I skipped out on that sauce. 

Gnocchi, sausage- Definitely surprised gnocchi was soft and chewy! A bit bland though. 

Caesar salad- typical. Enough dressing. Good!

Maggiano's salad- yum! Bits of bacon and signature vinaigrette (sort of a light Italian dressing) was great! Could enjoy that next time we go back. 

Tilapia on spinach bed- don't remember what sauce it was. Maybe white wine with cream. It was good, but again, a bit bland. 

Mashed sweet potato- bland!!! No sweetness at all. Hated this side. 

Creamed corn- bland too! Sides were failures. 

Chocolate cake- rich in flavor! Beats the bland food. Be sure to ask for coffee or hot tea or hot water. 

Pumpkin cheesecake- typical. Was good but nothing amazing to say. 

Customer service- quick with the meals! Didn't waste any time getting us our food. Thank goodness! We were hungry! Only suggestion would be to offer coffee, tea, or hot water before serving dessert. Server offered this after we were done with our dessert. Even when the other servers brought the desserts, we didn't see our main server. We still enjoyed family time though."}
{"text":"If you are planning an event, you will be beyond impressed with Maggiano's Little Italy.  I had my lunch wedding reception at Little Maggiano's and was so impressed by their amazing customer service, food, ambiance, and patience throughout the planning process and on my wedding day.  I started e-mailing the banquet staff about 6 months out from the event.  Jesse and Kara were absolutely amazing to work with...they answered all of my e-mails within a timely manner.  They were also so accommodating with my various requests.  I was so impressed when I walked in to my wedding reception and saw everything set up so beautiful and all of my guests having so much fun.  Now the food, that's another story....It was DELICIOUS!!!  The portions were big and the food was wonderful.  I don't even have enough words to rant and rave enough about Maggiano's Little Italy!!!  I would highly recommend them for any type of event.  Even my guests were saying, \"this is the best wedding I have been to!\" and I really do owe it to the chefs, wait staff, and banquest staff for making the day amazing!!"}
{"text":"We attended a  a rehearsal dinner about a week ago. The food took a little too long to come out. But when it did it was great! Served family style. Kept bringing more if needed. Did a really nice job!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been a HUGE fan of this place, up until this visit.  In fact, this visit will likely make me never walk into another Maggiano's ever. 

The hostess did not great us, just took us back to a table. No hello. nothing.  Upon being seated, our \"waitress\" comes up to us and says \"uhmmm, yah, I get it if you don't know what you want since you just sat down\" and walks away. NOT KIDDING. It was all down hill from there.  

The food was cold and just awful. Plain awful. No taste. The portion sizes are HUGE but I'm not trying to feed a village, just me.  

I got the Ravioli.  How do you mess up Ravioli?  Go to Maggiano's.  Cold and slimy and the sauce tasted like a salt shaker fell into it.

Why didn't I complain at the restaurant?  I never had a chance to.  The waitress never came by to find out how our food was.  She never delivered the food either, just the runner.  

Really bad experience and for the $60 bucks spent plus tip for 2 of us, we will be dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food it excellent however, food it a bit pricey and the portions are not enough for a beast. Comparable to other Italian restaurants"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here many times and love all the dishes. I am particularly find of the butternut squash pastas they have during special seasons.  My husband always gets the steak and really enjoys it.  They also offer two for one.  You order one meal then another that they prepare for you to take home for another meal. It's really a great deal!  

The service here is top notch, they know how to take care of their customers.  Did I mention their pre-dinner bread is fabulous and endless?!  

We also had our rehearsal dinner in the banquet rooms upstairs.  What an awesome location!  It was so elegant and we had our own bartender and open bar.  It was really classy."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is both my husband and my favorite Italian restaurant to eat at.  It is amazing!  Fresh, flavorful, good portion size, reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere (dim, energetic, but not overly loud).  We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  Staff is awesome.  Only downfall is without a reservation, you will have a wait (sometimes even with one)."}
{"text":"I completely loved Maggianos on the strip!
We went there for Easter Dinner and I had Salmon Oscar! It was so wonderful!  I also had a cup of beef with barley soup and it was so awesome.  Our Waiter, \"NOEL\"  was so attentive I dropped the napkin from my lap twice, and each time the waiter, \"NOEL\" saw that I'd dropped it and insisted that I take his new one which he flew to my rescue with!  ( Can you believe it? I didn't even have to ask! ).  When we left the restaurant, I forgot my doggie bag and NOEL once again came to my rescue...  NOEL actually found us by running to us at the valet and gave it to me.... it's been a long time since a waiter really went that extra mile for us !  I'm going to return as a happy customer of Maggianos and I will insist that I get \"NOEL\"  as my Waiter!  Thank you Maggianos & NOEL for an awesome meal and the greatest Waiter!!! 
Sincerely, 
Jody Bedwell"}
{"text":"When it comes to Vegas restaurants, this would not have been my first choice. There is one near my house and I prefer to eat at places I have never been while I am on vacation, but it was my friends birthday dinner. We had a party of 11, so we had to order off the family style menu. We looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there. We ordered the Fried Mozzarella and Stuffed Mushrooms to start. For entrees we ordered a Lobster Carbonara, Chicken Parmesan, Beef Medallions and a Bow Tie Pasta. We thought we would get one plate of each, but they brought 2 of each, one for each end of the table.  We where well fed. Dessert was my favorite. House made terramissu and Apple Cobbler. Wonderful! 

Our server was wonderful too. She was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks never ran dry. It was a great experience. =)"}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate occasions since this location has opened. The first time, my experience was decent but also slightly frustrating. My server was very out of focus and inattentive. We were waiting forever for refills, the check, and so on. The second time, the server we had was a lot more attentive. But what I have noticed is that the staff is not very well read on the menu. They do not seem to know how the menu works or what is on it. This isn't just from the servers I had, but also from hearing other servers talk to other tables. I would just suggest that the servers read up more on the menu and get the information down on lock. We had two entrees to go and when we got in the car we noticed only one was in the bag. Which was odd because we watched our server check the bag and assumed that it was all in there. When we brought it back and explained the situation, the host looked at another employee and says \"what do I do\". That just shows that the staff needs more training. So they called for the manager and we got our second entree. But he didn't really apologize or make sure everything was okay. Which isn't really surprising considering how the overall experience was, but if you are a manager you need to provide the best service possible and ensure that your customers are satisfied and will come back. Overall: it's a glorified Olive Garden. My experience wasn't BAD, it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The staff needs some more training that's for sure. The food isn't amazing and there's definitely better Italian restaurants in the same price range near by. I'm not sure I'll be back. Maybe I'll give it another chanc when it's been open longer and the restaurant is running more smoothly. The two star rating is based mostly on service, the food was okay."}
{"text":"Food was great; staffs are friendly, very pleasant ambiance. Our banquet managers Beth and Sabrina helped us on planning the event -We were 300++ miles away from them, and I didn't have a problem communicating w/ them - they will always respond to my questions (email) about the event planning. 
They allow us to bring our own microphone, centerpcs and even decorations :) to complete the picture! 4 stars because we only have 1 staff (Javier) helping us - he is very courteous and gracious to attend all our demands, however, it always took him time to come and serve another guest.. Mr. friendly - Manager came to the rescue - apologize and make it up with us :) ..--

Bit of advice - the patio -is a little loud so if you are planning to have a solemn or event that needs a quiet environment you should choose their indoor banquets.
 
Overall, salute to Maggiano's - for making our wedding reception, a memorable one.."}
{"text":"My friends and I met for Sunday dinner here and we had a wonderful time. 

We arrived a little after 5pm and there was a very short wait. After we were seated our waitress arrived in no time to take our drink orders, go over the menu and bring out some bread.

That bread was so stinking good. It's not your typical restaurant bread. They are indiviauals rolls that you could dip in oil or spread butter on....ahhhh so good....BUT be careful! Too many rolls will force you to take most of your dinner home. (Trust me, I know!) 

For my meal, I went with the Classic Pasta special. Basically you order one entree to eat there and another to take home and enjoy the next day!

How awesome is that???

I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatball dinner with meat sauce for there and the Taylor Street Baked Ziti (sausage, ziti and pomodoro sauce) to take home. 

The spaghetti and meatball dinner was delicious it comes with your choice of mariana or meat sauce with one HUGE meatball. The spaghetti noodles were classic. But that meatball was the real winner. They put breadcrumbs and cheese in the meatball fillling and bake it to perfection. I enjoyed every bite. I definetly recommend it. I'll have to try the ziti and update my review with my thoughts on that! 

When we were all done, dessert was not even an option, there was simply no room for it but for less than $15 we left full and happy.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for Mother's Day and hand to wait about 15-minutes before we were actually seated. This can be expected since it was Mother's Day which is usually the busiest day in a restaurants year. We always do the family style menu which includes all you can eat for everything you pick. The food was excellent but service was a little slow. Our whole experience lasted over 3 hours...we weren't in a big hurry but did a lot of waiting as well.

My only other gripe is they only have one tier of the family style now, where as before there were three tiers... The only choice includes a lot of food and is a mix of the top two tiers. I wish they still offered the cheaper family style option that doesn't include an entree and dessert."}
{"text":"Extremely good chain restaurant. Food is always very good, and service is outstanding.
One of my very favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Pricey, but good. Our server was great (sorry, forget your name). Brought us some free lemon sugar cookies (totally against my diet, lol). I had the salmon and it was phenomenal.

Environment was classy and quiet for lunch. My father and fiance enjoyed their meals (dad, with the spaghetti... fiance with the salad). My dad actually got some sort of deal where he got a meal to go, so that was pretty cool tool.

We also had the table bread, which was the classic bread with oil and balsamic vinegar. Tasty, but nothing to rave about. Server was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Las Vegas! Due to an autoimmune I am required to eat gluten free. They were SO knowledgeable! I had the Caprese Chicken it was Delish! The Mr. had the sausage and gnocchi and said it was great!"}
{"text":"When the first words out of the server's mouth are, \"So! Did you hear the great news about Osama?\" I question how the meal is going to go. Let's leave the politics at home, please.

I've never been the biggest fan of Maggiano's. Used to eat there in Florida from time to time. Sure huge portions can be a good thing; if those huge portions actually taste good. 

Bruschetta dish was eh. My pasta was soggy. They brought out the wrong one and had to go back to correct it. The meat sauce had hardly any meat. 

Overall a disappointing meal. An upside was the private corner booth they gave our party. I felt like Al Capone. . .

Would recommend steering clear of here. It's about the show here, but the execution and delivery leave A LOT to be desired."}
{"text":"Major props for customer service at Maggiano's. We had made reservations for 8:30 pm last saturday, thinking we'd be done with our shopping by then. But we got done early and the wait was like 2 hours there. So we started the restaurant hop -- called several places trying to find a shorter wait. We settled on Mitchell's Fish House because their wait was 30 minutes. So, we canceled our reservations at Maggiano's.  But the wait was much longer than Mitchell's promised, so by around 7:30 we decided to leave. We went back to Maggiano's and explained what happened. They were AWESOME. They reinstated our reservation (it was only 8 pm) and got us in even before that. Of course dinner was wonderful -- that's a given. 
My personal favorite? The eggplant parm. Nice!"}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding reception, and I'm blown away!

They served everything family style and I got to try a bit of everything.  We had lasagna, ravioli, chicken parm and eggplant parm. For desert we have tiramisu and apple pie with ice cream. We also had a walnut and cranberry salad and Caesar salad. Everything was superb!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was not so. Cheap food at a high price. It tasted very generic and was way overpriced."}
{"text":"Everything from start to finish was amazing. From making the reservation to our server to the food to the drinks. No complaints here. The Christmas decor was absolutely beautiful as well and they gave us a great seat facing the Fashion Mall and The Wynn. I would not have thought to come here and less I had a bunch of gift cards for here but I am glad I did."}
{"text":"I had to get on here and review Maggiano's in Scottsdale because the service we received was so outstanding! 
My daughter decided to go here for her 13th birthday dinner. When we arrived, on a Sunday night, we were surprised that there was a 20 minute wait. We decided to have appetizers and drinks in the bar while waiting for our table. The manager asked what we were celebrating and we told him. 

We were seated just as we were finished with our apps and drinks and the manager handed my daughter the specials menu specifically. Printed on the menu was a little note at the bottom that said Happy 13th Birthday. I know this was an easy thing for them to do but it really made her feel special. 

Our server was excellent. He steered my husband away from the wine they were featuring and offered a taste of it. My husband agreed that the house special was not up to par and the server suggested a wine that was much better and less expensive! My daughter and I split the Gnocci and we were surprised to learn that when you order off the Classic menu, you get to choose another item that they wrap up and send home with you! Like you are a guest at their home! The gnocci were very good and one serving was more than enough for the two of us. We also shared the Caesar salad which was good too. My husband had the chicken Parmesan which comes with a side of spaghetti. I enjoyed his meal too. 

We were deciding what to do for dessert when our waiter came and cleared the table telling us we needed to make some room for some items. (Hint, hint). A few moments later a large platter of their dessert sampler plate arrived with candles lit. It was beautiful! And the bar brought over a virgin chocolate martini that was equally exquisite. Keep in mind that we ordered none of this. The manager decided to make our celebration special, and he hit the mark! The dessert and drink were comped but even if they had not been, it would have been worth it. 

The food is great, the service is excellent! 

O"}
{"text":"Impressive for an Italian chain, certainly a lot better than the more ubiquitous Olive Garden. 

Service was excellent when I went and the food was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the calamari, which was lightly breaded and delicious. I would highly recommend.

We also ordered from their classic pastas menu so for a little over 12 dollars I had an eggplant parmesan in restaurant and a baked ziti to take home for later. I enjoyed the eggplant but it was a little more breading than I cared for. The eggplant slices were thin and while some people might like that, I prefer less breading and more eggplant. Still, it was tasty.

All in all, I'd come back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Been busy lately and time with the GF had been at a minimum.  Over the years she has spoken very highly of Maggianos.  Having never been before... a window of opportunity would present it's self to give it a shot.  The GF had a gift card, we had the time and reservations were made.

We arrived at the Fashion Show Mall and parked half way from the north forty.  We made our way around the outside of the mall and entered.  

Very nice atmo and servers in white shirts.  We had a window table.  Sounds fancy....but it was not.  We gazed out on the promenade outside and watched people loiter and or pass by.

Service was initially slow, and pretty much stayed that way through the entire meal.  I had a drink run empty and was not addressed until 15-20 minutes after.

I ordered up the Chicken Piccata.  It looked delicious on the menu.  The GF ordered up Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara.

We chowed down on bread prior to plate touchdown.  If they don't bring the balsamic, be sure to ask for it.

When the plates arrived, I surveyed the contents.  It all looked good enough.  Dipping into the two plates with my fork.....something seemed off.  It seemed almost sort of commonplace.  

My eyes and my knowledge of the location told me I was at someplace that was supposed to be special.   My tastebuds were telling me I have been here many times before.  I could not really put my finger on it.  That was until I noticed the gift card the GF was partially paying with.  On the back of the card, were familiar corporate foodie locations I was well aware of.  

Putting it all together, Maggiano's taste reminded my of other chains.  Putting it all together, I can check this off the list."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food with all the regular Italian fare you're accustomed to. This isn't going to be anything out of the ordinary, but if you're looking for a good-solid place to take a group while you're visiting the Strip, this is it. Great views and patio seating is available."}
{"text":"Super dry fish and the pasta there sucked. The service was ok but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. For the price, you can get better food somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place was great! Gabriel was our server and he was fantastic! He was on top of everything, new his menu very well and even recommend some items and new in detail about them. I had the lobster carbonara which was excellent with the pumpkin cheesecake. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Be careful where you get sat. Hostess sent us to a long rectangular bar table right behind the hostess stand, yet there is no waiter service there, as we found out from the three other couples that were in the same predicament.  After some discussion with manager, we got our meal comped (all we wanted was pasta to go for the little guy).  I've been before and had a good visit, but this time was no bueno.  Kudos to manager for recognizing the situation, we were about to walk out."}
{"text":"Took my sweetie here for his birthday! Our food was great! We did have a little bit of a wait even though we had reservations because we forgot it was Restaurant week. We ended up doing the eat one there (and take one home) deal instead. Our server was super nice and helpful with food selection."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever tasted. Went here on years eve with my wife and daughter and it was super delicious.  We ha stuffed mushrooms and chicken Parm and the 4 cheese ravioli with a Side of spaghetti. I wish I would've took pictures of everything we ate everything was super delicious I recommend this place to everyone who goes to Las Vegas to stop by this restaurant. And when you're leaving I recommend you to grab a handful of the little chocolates they have on a lil basket they're the bomb."}
{"text":"Thank you Beverly for making my nieces 21st birthday lunch so special. The food was delicious but your great service will definitely bring us back."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is about this place. Yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. We both had the crab cakes and they were horrible! And the service sucks. We were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. 

The bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. And she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.

I should've gone to The Capital Grille instead."}
{"text":"Terrible hostesses. I walked in at 5:30 abd asked how long the wait for 3 people was. I was told no wait. I said my people will be here at six can I put my name in a list, knowing it would get busy.  St sux I was told the wait was an hour.  Take your seats immediately even if your party is not there yet.   Customer service is non existent they count on the one shot tourist trade..

After some discussion the manager Mike M. Made things right..  hopefully his staff will improve under his tutelage."}
{"text":"i typically do not enjoy going to any chain restaurant but maggiano's changes that for me. i have been there a few times and have never been disapointed. im used to going for italian food in boston, providence and nyc so the food is not really authentic but it is really good americanized italian. i have had the regular menu and the family menu. either way we have always left with lunch for the next day. their to go containers are really cool as well. the containers have food reheating instructions and you put the container right in the oven to reheat and it tastes just like how it tasted the day before. we really enjoyed sitting in their outdoor rotunda area. it made us feel we were not even in a mall."}
{"text":"Delicious Food with Great Service..
Feels old school & Classy Italian Restaurant..
A gentleman comes to tables & offers to Sing for you.. very fun! Must tip him too! 
Chicken Parm was huge & definitely enough food.. don't bother getting a glass of Wine-- get the Bottle! Better deal.. 
Recommend seating in a big booth to get a view of the outside/strip to Enjoy the Full dining experience.. valet park & go up elevators right to restaurant.. valet is by the outside entrance of Forever 21 Store (fashion show mall)
Text the valet when you're ready to Go.."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Slow. No fountain drinks. Lagsania was horrible. Tasted like a TV dinner.  Very disappointed from the brand standard."}
{"text":"First, let me set the stage...my wife and I were married 2/21/11. We ate at this Maggiano's that evening. Since then, we have eaten at this Maggiano's every year on our anniversary. So, you can imagine how special it is to us. Using Open Table, I booked us for 2/21/16, left a note stating our special occasion and began looking forward to the date. We arrived early, told the hostess and manager it was our anniversary and were seated. Ten minutes (not an exaggeration) later, other than a waiter saying he wasn't our waiter, but brought us water and bread, we had not been greeted or otherwise acknowledged, we got up and left.
Needless to say, we found a new restaurant to help us celebrate as we will not go back to Maggiano's."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my 25th birthday dinner and let me just tell you, our waiter Anthony made our experience absolutely exceptional. He made conversation like we had known each other for years! We wanted to hug him on our way out the door! My husband and I have traveled a lot and it was the best service we have had ANYWHERE. The food was delectable. I had the lobster carbonara and my husband had the seafood pasta. His dish was piled high with seafood. Usually you only get a couple of each type of seafood but he literally had a plate full. I got a free birthday tiramisu and Anthony also brought me cute little lemon cookies with candles on them! An all around a Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Almost too much to write out but hands down the worst fine out experience in awhile. We went out for dinner for two birthdays. We got seated quick because of the reservation but they was about the extent of it. The place was piping hot and the air conditioning was clearly not working on that side of the restaurant. The waitress kept saying they'd get to it but...

Thanks for the bread and cocktails cause our ordered appetizers came out about an hour later. The waitress told us everything was coming but nothing. Everyone else around us was getting everything they ordered on time. Our appetizer was burnt so they had to make it again. Well about 30 minutes later it came. 

Another half hour later our entrees came two hours after we sat down. All 8 plates were cold. The cheese had clearly melted but got cold again. We told the waitress to just pack it up. Pretty simple right? Well she packed up the  wrong meals for everyone at the table. Even the desserts that came with our meal. 

We complained to the staff and the meal was free which was good but what a waste of time. This place used to be good and maybe it was just one of those meals, but this was a comedy of errors by everyone who worked at Maggiano's. 

Too bad. Go to Avanti's and skip the hype of this place. It's more of an Olive Garden now."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I booked a reservation here for dinner before we went to our show while we were visiting Vegas this passed weekend. The minute we walked in we were greeted very pleasantly. We were promptly seated with a great view of the strip. Our server Ceci was cheerful and extremely knowledgeable about all the menu items. She made great wine recommendations that complimented our meals. Ceci went above and beyond when we casually mentioned that we were in town just to have a weekend getaway before our upcoming wedding in May, within moment she came back with a beautiful plate with chocolate cake & lemon cookies. The plate had \"congratulations\" scrolled across the top in chocolate. We had a great dining experience and will most definitely be back.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Out waiters name was Dave. He treated us so well. Answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations. We ate the stuffed shells, spaghetti and meatballs, and lasagna and it was spectacular! The food came out so fast, and we were starving. I will definitely be back to this place very soon!!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant, good brunch. Great service. Had a mix up on the order and they comped the whole thing.  AMAZING. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch, which happened to be Easter Sunday.Service was a bit slow and disjointed, but very apologetic and polite when you have their attention. My wine took a little while, my husband finished his first beer and ask for another when the server finally brought my first glass of wine. I suspect the Rose I ordered was not chilled and they had to get it chilled (quickly). I would rather know that...
Our food took a little while, but was watching other tables getting complimentary profiteroles, and we did not?

I got the crab cake benedict. It was very good, I needed a bit more s&p (not a criticism) but other than that it met my expectation, especially since seeing this ad on facebook it was my draw to the restaurant. Of course they could have hit a higher price point with lump meat vs \"mixed or shredded\" crab meat used but still it was good quality. My husband got the shrimp fra diavolo(sp?) it was solid, but a little on the cold side just a tad too small and not as spicy for our liking, but again, still solid. These are mostly just taste preference differences but still a solid dishes, but indoor ambiance was classy, we enjoyed dining in the outdoor area, we definitely will be back again, but with the nice people that work there I hope the service improves."}
{"text":"Solid 4.  I have been to three Maggiano's (2 in CA and now Vegas).  The one in Vegas is the best one.  This is my favorite place to eat Italian food.  The food is great.  They have large portions.  Service was quick and polite.  Always try to go to a Maggiano's on the off hours or make a reservation to avoid long waits.  My favorites are the chicken parm and garlic shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Excellent service, ambiance, food and again...service! Ask for Scott out on the patio - can't go wrong with his suggestions and service! Don't forget dessert - I had the cheesecake and a second glass of proscecco!"}
{"text":"Hostess is awful....TWICE...we came in...and twice the hostess screwed up our reservation.   We waited for an hour...even though we had reservations.  She absolutely forgot about us.  Negative star.  

The food is good...not great...and it takes FOREVER for the food to arrive...all dinners didn't arrive at the same time and we needed to remind the server that we were still waiting for entrees.  4 stars for the food. 

The server was pleasant...but truly overwhelmed. 3 stars. 

Big John on our second visit...perfect timing, kind, funny...made the experience considerably better. 5 stars for him! 

If you're looking for a nice relaxing dinner...this isn't the place for you.  

If you are looking for a loud, chaotic night out with decent food...this is it."}
{"text":"We went to Maggiano's to have dinner after a wedding. The room had been reserved in a beautiful private wine room. The food was delicious. The service by Bob and Jeremy was outstanding. They even brought in a iPod with music so the bride and groom could have a first dance. I highly recommend this place. I am from San Diego and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I love maggianos in Los Angeles in the Grove but this one in the Fashion Show Mall is absolutely amazing! The view of the strip is the Encore, the Wynn, and the Pallazzo. There are at least 25 foot floor to ceiling windows. The ambiance is rich and impressive. The staffing friendly and attentive. 
As we ate our dinner, we were serenaded by an Italian guitarist who sang to my parents. They loved it and we enjoyed watching them. 
The food was delicious as usual and the prices are  so fair. 
I will definitely go back AND recommend it to everyone. 
Did I mention that you can valet your car and just take an elevator to the second floor! Easy in and out!"}
{"text":"The service and food was excellent!  I was a concierge here in Las Vegas before and have eaten at many fine establishments and I would say that this one is a new addition to the top of my list.  Great classic Italian and a wonderful view of the strip.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice recently and was pleasantly surprised how Maggiano's exceeded my expectations that were already set decently high from recommendations. The service was top quality. Being Italian from New York I thought the food was amazing. I love how you can customize your order exactly how you'd like it. My second visit here was on a Tuesday evening and it was packed out! That should speak for itself."}
{"text":"I've seen Maggianos in other cities, but this was my first time dining at one.  We decided to have our meal \"family style\" which was recommend by my brother and his fiancee.   

The food was pretty good, in particular we enjoyed the mussels and loved  the Tiramisu.  Our server was excellent.  They also have some reasonably priced wines available.

I've heard mixed things about this chain, but was pretty impressed with my visit.  Family style definitely seems to be the way to go when dining here."}
{"text":"Great food and service for the price! Also a good starting point at the end of the strip to start your night. Ate dinner here with my wife and then we worked our way back towards our hotel after."}
{"text":"As a guest to my Grandmas 90th birthday party at Maggiano's I thought this place was fantastic! We had a room set up upstairs, which was decorated before we got there and they had tables set up. Not much room for dancing, but we didn't really dance that much... :). 

When we arrived we were able to valet our car, something we have never done before and we felt like celebrities. 

The package that was purchased was appetizers, a full open bar, and a buffet dinner, as well as dessert for a party of around 50-60 people. 

The appetizers were my favorite part of the food portion, with yummy fried mozzarella, stuffed mushrooms, and bread. I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar, but all of the waitstaff was very accommodating. 

The bar was a little stingy on the alcohol in my opinion, but hey, maybe I like strong drinks. 

For dinner we had salad, salmon, many pastas, meatballs, and several other things I'm sure I never even saw.

There was also a champagne toast, which the waiters and waitresses brought around glasses of champagne to everyone. A great touch. 

They have a sound system available, but you have to bring in your own music. An iPod worked fine for us.   

Desserts were a vast array of anything you could think of and was delicious. 

Great way to spend any birthday party, this one will go down in the record books."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate another anniversary at Maggianos this year and I am so glad we did. We have a reservation at 6pm and were seated in less than 5 minutes.

We started with the mozzarella marinara which was nice thick slices of cheese breaded and fried and served topped with marinara and more cheese. I mean how could that be wrong? 

I chose to get the Rustic Chicken and Shrimp minus the shrimp that I have ordered before but SO enjoy! It was very good with lots of chicken, mounds of pasta and a creamy sauce that kind of make you want to forget your table manners and slurp it up. 

Hubby chose the center cut filet mignon. At $39, you would expect exactly what he got. Steak so tender it almost needed no knife and flavored crust that was perfct...even if a bit salty for my preference.

We chose the tiramisu as our dessert and it arrived with candles in honor of our anniversary!  It was rich, flavorful and absolutely delish! Our waiter put a couple of chocolate chip cannolis on the side as a extra anniversary treat and they were delicious too!

Speaking of waiter, we were lucky to have Dink who was helpful, funny and attentive. He was happy to offer suggestions when asked and make small talk without being obtrusive. 

All in all a great visit!"}
{"text":"May 24, 2016: Went here to celebrate my sister and nephew's birthdays! Such a great family friendly place with so much variety. 

Our server Hector was phenomenal. He immediately took the order for my nephew (turning 3) who was getting anxious because he was hungry and offered appetizers for the table. We decided on the family style menu and everything we ordered was awesome. I have to come back to Hector's service. He was so attentive, helpful and genuinely seemed like he wanted to be there. Thank you Hector for an awesome family birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Got to try this place out for the first time in their banquet rooms, so as far as service goes: it was definitely fantastic. ALL the servers were on top of it from filling drinks to clearing the plates. The banquet room itself was very comfortable and it had its own bar (sodas, too). 

Food! They take Italian food to the next level. I was only able to include the starters, but my absolute favorite were the calamari, chicken parm and tiramisu. The foods overall weren't greasy or overlooked. I included the menu that was served for the event. 

I'll definitely have to make my way back to have the dining experience!"}
{"text":"I just held my wedding reception at Maggianos and they were fabulous! I was planning from a far because I'm from Canada.  There was more than enough food for everyone and I also opted for a bar package and it was worth every penny. The waiters always made sure my guests had a drink.   The mushroom di ravioli was to die for! Maggianos also helped me with getting floral centerpieces, they were fairly priced and have great longevity! Also I had some guests with food allergies and the chef came and spoke to those people personally and accommodated for them.  Great value, good size portions and excellent staff."}
{"text":"You know,  the view from Maggianos is superb.  A nice spot hidden in the second level of Fashion Show Mall's restaurant row.  

The bar is perfect for a quick lunch and the dining room or patio offer an outstanding seat for Vegas dinner.  They have banquet rooms and catering for meetings work functions,  where the service will leave you feeling fabulous!

I recommend the carbonara.  It's super fresh,  and you'll be left with enough for dinner the next night.  The egg on top is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Not the 5 stars because it could be a bit less expensive, a bit at least.
But the food, OMG, the food..... have the lobster+crab+etc fettucinni, it was soooooooooo good, the portions huge, really huge.
I hope I could eat there again tonight."}
{"text":"A perfect happy hour!  Drinks & appetizers left nothing to be desired.  The tomato/basil flatbread was outstanding and I simply loved the spinach stuffed mushrooms!  All of our choices were very good, and the bartender was a delight!  Warm environment, great food and great service!  A hit all around!"}
{"text":"Daughter and her boyfriend treated me there for father's day.  My meal was very good. They give a you a large portion of paste. I could not eat  finish the entire meal."}
{"text":"New & shiny! 

We used to frequent the one on the strip and now we have a local one near our home in Summerlin! It's new and beautiful and the service has always been very friendly. We stick to what we love here and always order the same dishes ~ four cheese ravioli with pesto alfredo sauce and chicken francese which is one of my favorite dishes from any restaurant! (Parmesan crusted chicken with lemon butter sauce, crispy potatoes and a light salad on the side).

This particular Maggiano's also sends you home with a complimentary pasta dish when you order one at the restaurant as a thank you! How nice!!! I don't know of any other restaurant that does this and it's such a thoughtful touch! We're excited that we finally have this location and plan on having lots of family dinners here.

*If you're celebrating anything special they'll bring you delicious lemon butter cookies. These are addictive!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is sure to please.  Our waiter is from Mexico and he loved to talk.  He knew the menu and was condfiendent in his recommendations.  Frank Sinatra's picture is hung on the wall by the hostess area.

I ordered the veal and mushroom ravioli.  \"Homemade ravioli filled with ground veal, mushrooms, Marsala wine and asiago cheese. Browned on top with toasted bread crumbs, and house cheese. Served with Alfredo sauce, sun-dried tomoatoes, basil and parsley.\" 

My friends ordered:

Chicken Parmesan -- \"Lightly breaded chicken breasts fried and topped with provolone cheese and marinara sauce.\"

Gnocchi -- Ricotta pasta simmered in a delicately balanced sauce prepared with our classic pomodoro cream and finished with vodka and roasted garlic\";

Mom's Lasagna -- \"Whipped ricotta cheese layered with pasta sheets, crumbled meatballs, Italian sausage and marinara sauce. Topped with provolone cheese and your choice of our meat or marinara sauce\".  They all loved it.  Atmosphere is great.  There's a picture of Frank Sinatra"}
{"text":"i LOVE LOVE LOVE Maggiano's. I've been to three of their locations, and most recently the Las Vegas one again.

My bf and I arrived around 8 on a Saturday night, and thankfully only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. We took the first available, which was outside and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not Maggiano's fault, but there was an iPod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. Even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, I was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. That being said, I still had a great dinner! 

I've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  We started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  The Maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! And for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and spinach manicotti. Words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. 

I somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. But I just absolutely love their cheesecake. I am NOT a big fan of cheesecake, but Maggiano's makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful! 

So if you are in Vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food I highly recommend Maggianos!"}
{"text":"really enjoyed my visit to Maggiano's. the lasagna was soooo yummy"}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly but sadly they don't do gluten free pizza so sad!!! Like the new location downtown summerlin. It will be fabulous in the summer."}
{"text":"Gluten free pasta yippee and lots of other Italian dishes"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after shopping at the Fashion Show Mall.  Excellent service and great tasting food!  Ordered the stuffed mushrooms for appetizer.  Main entree was lasagna and mushroom stuffed ravioli.  Arlene, our server, was very attentive and quick with her service."}
{"text":"Once again these folks top my charts of the friendliest places to eat. Great food, wine and a happy atmosphere. I Love Maggianos ! My friends and I allways have a great time."}
{"text":"Waited at the table for 15 minutes before waitress came. Ordered languistino pasta and the prosciutto was jammed like lasagna without breaking apart properly. Pasta over cooked. And ingredients do not taste fresh. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Hands down the best Italian restaurant I have ever ate at! Service is top notch. Couldn't ask for anything better."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to take your significant Otto dinner or lunch. Or just take yourself to the bar and enjoy. 

Part of the downtown summerlin area there is thigh parking and it will be busy at peak times, so act accordingly and is better to just get a reservation. 

We like the food and it's not too pricey. The decor is old school and nice."}
{"text":"Visiting Maggianos was one of the best experiences I had in Vegas.  We found it on Yelp from the glowing reviews and they pretty much all held true.  The service was friendly, the food was ENORMOUS and subtle in flavor.  We vacuumed up everything.  The wine was fine and they served us hot bread rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before our appetizers.  All in all a way classy italian place for EXTREMELY cheap.  I couldn't believe I had such a delicious meal in an elegant environment AND wine for only $20!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Dinner Time, usually try to stay away from Chain Restaurants but decided to stop in. This was a rather busy night, would recommend making reservations. We did and we're seated within 10 minutes. We were greeted by a very nice waiter Daniel.  Decided to kip appetizers and went right in for the entrees. Entrees were up within 15 minutes. I had the chicken alfredo added bacon and peas to make it more of a carbonara. Hubby had the lasagna. We were in shock of the food being up so quick. The food was hot, delicious and the flavor combination was superb. Best is with any of the classic pastas you get one to take home. We ended the night with Creme Brûlée. Would recommend for date night, family, and events."}
{"text":"Nice place to dine, it's ambient, food is delicious-not expensive, and importantly waitresses and their service is top notch. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always a good go to spot.  Service is quick food is good, large portions, great prices and deals.   I love the traditional decor, great place for groups and kids."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night and I must admit I was not impressed. Their food is just OK not great just OK. The waitress was very nice cannot complain about her. This place is definitely overpriced for the quality of its food. We got there about 830 in the evening. It was not all that crowded but yet we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated. They jammed us in the back room that was packed with people and noisy as hell. The lady that seated us I guess looked at the expression on my face and said if you don't like this table you can wait a little longer for something else. And I saw other tables and booths open and clean. I was not in the mood to fight or argue I just wanted to eat. I should've just left. I will not go back to this restaurant.


Well after my first review to my surprise I was contacted by this restaurant owner. He went above and beyond what I would've expected my back situation turned into a win win. I will continue to patronize this restaurant. They do care about their customers and what they think and feel. I have to commend this place on their extremely sincere response to me. More businesses should care like this restaurant about their customers.that's why I've given them five stars."}
{"text":"Good location for Italian on the strip. We came here after a long evening of shopping in the mall. I highly recommend getting their lite chicken marsala if you are on a diet. Service at the bar can be shoddy but the food is great. Also, try out their stuffed mushrooms for appetizers."}
{"text":"If you must go here, try the Brunch or more specifically Nona's banana pancakes. A very large portion of banana infused cakes with the nice addition of caramelized bananas and caramel as well. It was $12.95. The potatoes were extra on the side, but well cooked and dusted with parmesan for some morning flair. 


Returned to use a gift card that was full of restrictions. We did not get sick, but the lunch wasn't great and the waitress took forever to bring us our check in a mostly empty dining room. The mushroom ravioli filling tasted way too earthy and overpowering, but my \"light\" fettuccine alfredo was a bit better with chicken and thick ribbon noodles. The buy one-get one offer was good, but taking home bad food is not good. Still, just a fancy chain with valet parking and below average food. 

FIRST MEAL
Thanksgiving was my first meal here and likely the grand finale. If you were one of the seven people in my party who decided to eat ham on that day (not me), then you got food poisoning. The whole meal was handled poorly and it was actually reimbursed only three days later. Maggiano's paid back the $300 of the $378 tab for the meal. We were a party of eight and they bring out three ravioli's and small side dishes for everybody, not too mention they ran out of salad, one desert and creamed spinach. It should not matter if we were the 8pm reservation or not, they should have enough food for the whole day. Also, no cranberry sauce, no gravy and we already know about the ham issues. Finally, they figured we could just share some deserts, instead of giving us our own piece of cake or pie. The waiter was a giggly kid and the holiday meal was ruined - for some it was ruined for hours after. Maggiano's, just forgetaboutit."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Great taste and quality and large portions. We went to sinatra the night before, and.this.place has better food at more.affordable.prices"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up!!! James our waiter was wonderful. My dairy allergy was not a problem. The chef came to the table and told me what would be used instead of butter and cheese."}
{"text":"Heard good things, very disappointing.
I suppose it's acceptable for families who enjoy big plates...but those big plates are filled with mediocre food.
To begin, we were met by a truly rude hostess.  She led us to our table.  I asked if we could sit at a different available table six feet away because I wasn't in the mood to sit right next to two children in high chairs.  Her response, \"No.\"   
I said, \"We made a reservation and I'd like to sit at this other table.\"  
She blurted out, \"It's a different server.\"
Getting frustrated by her completely inappropriate attitude, I said, \"Let me remind you that I'm the customer and I'm not interested in your attitude.\"  
She walked to the other table, threw down the menus and walked away.
Rediculous.  
We were going to walk out but the very gracious waiter said,
\"I saw her behavior and I'm really sorry.  She was completely inappropriate.  I'm going to talk to our manager.\"
Both the waiter and the manager, who was very apologetic, were very kind and tried their best to make it a pleasant experience afterwards.  I am appreciative of their efforts.  
Onto the food.  I come from New York and although I'm not expecting the level of amazing Italian food prepared there, I was hoping for something a little less \"restaurant chain\" like.  
I had the linguini with clams.  Very oily and the chopped clams were kind of tough and rubbery.  They tasted like canned minced clams.  
We also had the chicken piccata.  Chicken piccata is usually pounded thin.  This dish was two chicken breasts with lemon sauce and capers thrown on top.  Not too good.  The side of pasta which the menu listed as aglio e olio sauce, which is garlic and oil, was spaghetti and butter.  
We were hoping to enjoy this restaurant but wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it as good Italian food.  
And as far as the young female hostess who was so shockingly rude, she's the \"face of the restaurant\" and it's far from welcoming or attractive."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on our first day in Vegas.  The food was excellent, the service was fast and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice.  Nothing was outrageous expensive and although we went there during the day, the view of the Wynn and that end of the Strip was nice.  I was told that this is a chain, but we don't have any in Massachusetts and I never would have guessed... Definitely a great option for italian if you are in town!"}
{"text":"I feel like the world is becoming more and more critical and it's getting harder to find a nice place to eat, with good food, and good service.  That's exactly how I would describe Maggiano's.  

It's obviously a chain but this Maggiano's has a nice atmosphere from the moment you walk in.  You have to walk through the bar, which some may not like, but the back room has some good vibes.

As for the food, I would highly recommend the 2 for $40.  In my opinion, it's a steal.  You get two salads, two entrees, a desert, and two more entrees to take home.  That's four quality meals for $40 for food that I think is a step-up from Red Robin, CPK, etc..

All in all, if you're looking for some tasty Italian, head over to Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"My sister got married and we had the reception in one of the private rooms. The food was amazing! Everything about the night turned out perfect because of the great people that work here. Everyone was so accommodating. Couldn't have imagined it being any better."}
{"text":"Maggiano's spreads the love when it comes to food.  If you order their standard pasta dishes you get a second one to take home.  So if I was dirt poor, in college, or needed to feed a little league team, I would eat here twice a week.

Unfortunately they miss a lot of important steps that would make me want to come back on my own.  Their fried zucchini is the heaviest version of this appetizer I've ever had.  I could hardly eat another bite of anything after it and it wasn't that enjoyable - dense and no seasoning, not even salt.  

The bread they serve is just tiny little rolls.  Now I know why...  Everything else is so dense you don't need them.

I liked the meat sauce on their spaghetti but the meatball was stone cold on the inside.  So that was the end of that.  I didn't even bother sending it back.   There are too many other options nearby that are better and not that much more expensive."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday celebration and had the \"Family Feast\" deal they have. Its for gluttons, but everything was really good! It included desserts, but I was way too stuffed for anything like that y the time we had finished our regular courses."}
{"text":"Quality of the Dish:  5 *stars points
Service: 4 *
Interior: 3*
Organizations: 5*
Hygiene  : 4* 

The price was not overpriced for the portions"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at a Maggiano's in a long time and never before at this particular location but I really could not ask for anything better. Freshly prepared and expertly served, we were very pleased. 

My wife had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and it was awesome. I went with the veal parmigiana and it too was excellent. We aren't wine drinkers but we did end up with room for dessert and the apple crostada with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel was also outstanding. The only miss of the whole evening was that my wife's water glass was allowed to run dry but that was the only error that the server made.

All in all, another great meal and part of a really fun two nights in Charlotte on our way to Playa del Carmen, Mexico!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular guest, and I'm very disappointed with the new \"photography\" service that this restaurant offers. The girl that barely spoke English, insisted on taking a picture while I was eating!!! Moreover, in approximately five minutes a young man, who did not have a proper uniform for this upscale place, came over with a printed pictures and pushed me to buy one. I can't believe this restaurant went down so low to allow soliciting. I simply won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem on the Las Vegas Strip.  Walking into this place you would think it's a five-star restaurant with prices to match but thankfully, the prices here were very affordable and in true Italian style, the portions were very large.  We would have taken what we had left-over to go but with no place to heat it up at our hotel, it wasn't worth it.  Located in the Fashion Mall, if you love Italian food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here. I imagine all of the servers practically know us by name now which makes visiting fun. Their food is really tasty and they have really big portion sizes so plan on taking some food home with you unless you have a massive appetite. The chicken parmesan is really good and most of their pasta's are great as well if you are looking for Italian. 

They also have a dish called Salmon Oscar that comes with a kind of white wine cream sauce that is delicious."}
{"text":"Steven is an awesome waiter!!! 

We love there chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs !!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food, very nice location, good white table cloth restaurant with reasonable prices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here this evening for my 2nd visit. Although the first visit was a very positive one, a reality check was in line this evening. 

1. Food server was not welcoming - rude in fact
2. Food server was very difficult to understand
3. Food server was robotic and seemed to be completely in genuine  (almost cold)
4. Asked management to change our server
5. Management came to the table and asked \"Why?\" (Um, yes - the Supervisor / MOD actually did this
6. Food quality was fair
7. New server was pleasant, but a little overly friendly and robotic. 
8. Likelihood of returning has diminished to 60%."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that we missed the lunch menu by a few minutes cause I was dying for one of the sandwiches.  The menu changes over at 3:00 so be mindful of the time.  The food was excellent!  The pasta is homemade so it has a light texture unlike store bought pasta.  The bruschetta is good, my favorite being the prosciutto with fig jam.  Our waitress was amazing!  She was so attentive and super friendly.  Ready to visit again!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Maggiano's. I first went to one of their establishments over 10 years ago in Chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since. When they opened one in Las Vegas I was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then. 

Maggiano's is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless you're super hungry. 

On our most recent visit we got Spaghetti and Meatballs, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Piccata, sauteed spinach, and mashed potatoes. As usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food. My niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti. I was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata. 

Needless to say that we are fans of Maggiano's and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrible servicio de parte de la hostess. Llegamos 4 de 5 personas de nuestro grupo y nos dijo que no nos daba la mesa hasta que llegue el quinto. El restaurante estaba casi vacio. Dijo que nos daba una mesa de 4 y cuándo llegue el quinto lo sentaba en otra mesa. Nos negó hablar con el gerente."}
{"text":"An incredibly great deal on everything. The music, service, environs, and piano singing entertainment are also exceptional.  Always a packed parking lot that they share with Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Very good food and truly Outstanding Service

A wide selection of traditional Italian dishes. Everything we had was very good to great, the mussels are outstanding, and the prices are not all that high, especially by Vegas standards. For a higher end Italian place you would pay the same prices in Edmonton and the service would be no where near as good.

Total bill was $270, before tip, for 5 people including two bottles of good wine, cocktails for three and three beer. Pretty standard in Vegas now to see \"Recommended Tip\" starts at 18% and goes to 20%. Well, they can kiss my butt, I don't care what they recommend. Typically I leave 10% for good service, 5% for mediocre and 0 for bad. Here we left 30%."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal here.  It's not like we make at home but we were very happy with it.  Portions were large and the price was great.  Two entrees and a glass of wine were only 40. Our server, Nick, could not have been nicer.  No complaints about this place."}
{"text":"First time for the brunch and it was very tasty. Our server was pretty attentive and had great recommendations. We had the Cranberry Crème Brulee' French toast, Crab Cake benedict and some peach bellinis. The bellini was frozen more like a margarita, yet tasty. The crab cake had high meat/low filling ratio, which we liked. The French toast was just the right amount of sweetness and was topped with strawberries, plus came with a side. Although enjoyed, we cannot make this an every weekend brunch due to the prices. It was not extreme, but $1/$2 pricier for portions. Will keep this one in the rotation."}
{"text":"Miron is fantastic! The food has always been good but service last time we were here wasn't. We made reservations but it was still about a 25 minute wait. I got the eggplant parm and my husband had the braised beef papparrelle. We both thought the eggplant parm was the best we've ever had. My husband loved his 7&7 and my sangria was mighty tasty too. Miron was on his game and everything was flawless. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family and it was a great experience. The wait staff was very friendly and their reservation system is very efficient. I put in my reservation at 8:30 and they had us seated before 9 even though the place was packed. Their food is great too. We got calamari (easily the best I've ever had), stuffed sausages, and mussels as appetizers and 2 types of pasta as part of the group menu deal. Dessert was some tasty cookies.

There was a friendly old man (not sure if he was staff or someone they hired to come in sometimes) singing to couples and people who had birthdays. At one point, the whole restaurant sang happy birthday to this guy with fake Elvis muttonchops. The atmosphere was very comfortable.

I highly recommend this place and I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Since our not-so-great visit the manager did contact us by email then a phone call just a few days after my first Yelp post.  She seemed genuinely concerned. Offered to send coupons as an olive branch. We never asked for anything extra, she offered it.  
So far I've called her 3 different times inquiring about the coupons she said she would send. First excuse was she went on vacation but she will send the coupon out the next day.  
Called a week later, she said she would look into what happend and why they didn't go out. Third call she told me she will now sent them out FedEx so she can \"Track it\".  Hmmm FedEx seems to be slow given this conversation took place a few days ago and I live within 10 miles of the place.
I will update IF and when we get said coupon.

Coupon finally arrived. Geez what an ordeal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Try the sangria, OMG!  The food and the atmosphere are top notch.  When will have friends come to town we always bring them to this restaurant.  So far there's not one - I need to warn you about. Everything has been delicious."}
{"text":"2nd Location in Vegas...Still just as good!!!! Great Food, great service!!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Maggiano's in Downtown Summerlin yesterday (6-10-18). We have had good and not so good experiences at this location but yesterday was by far THE BEST! Krystle was our server and from start to finish she was fantastic! Not only was she very friendly she was very attentive, professional, knowledgeable and genuinely wonderful. We love the food but because of Krystle's service we will be back just for her! I hope someone from Maggiano's sees this and gives Krystle kudos for her great work! She deserves it!"}
{"text":"First of all, excellent service! Steve, our server, was funny, helpful and very attentive to our table. Secondly, I'm Celiac and the chef actually came to the table to assure us that there are gluten free options and they do the best they can to not cross-contaminate. Third, the food was delightful and comforting, and I even left with a dish to take home. What a great experience - we will be back!"}
{"text":"For my mother-in-law's birthday last weekend, my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at Maggiano's, which is an old favorite haunt of his.

Maggiano's exterior is nothing spectacular considering they're stuck on the second floor of a mall, but once you step out of the elevator you're transported.  Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back / main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).

When our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet / battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).

The ambiance inside Maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I'd stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I'll get to in a minute) that I didn't even think to ask to try GT's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).

The adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn't drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn't touched it.

Turns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT's uncle (who'd flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.

My main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on Maggiono's bottomless glass of wine."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I ate here for an early dinner around 5:00pm, with no reservations, we were seated immediately, next to the window looking out to the strip (across from the booths. If I knew they weren't reserved, we would've sat there for sure!) All their window/patio seats outside were taken. We wanted the air conditioning, so it didn't bother us at all. If you choose to get a nice table for 2 outside reserve it or come early!

Chris was our server, and he was great, friendly, and genuinely interested in providing a fantastic guest experience. After ordering our appetizer, we were served their homemade bread (I think!) which was excellent, we then ordered stuffed mushroom caps, (DELICIOUS, and FILLING!) We placed an order for Baked Eggplant, and Rigatoni D' for entrees. The portions were ridiculously large and delicious. We also had 2 glasses of  White Zinfandel, which were during happy hour, and received %10 off our dinner after mentioning a coupon we had. The dinner came to $70.00, tip, taxes included, but it was a special treat for us, and we didn't mind as the service and food was excellent.

Would strongly recommend this restaurant if you have no plans and you're in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered to go and the portions were really sad. The side of asparagus had 8-10 strands in it what a rip off. The flatbread wasn't fully cooked. It was raw and the cheese not fully melted. I would have taken it back except I stayed at Encore and didn't walk to walk all the way back over. Will likely not go back and for sure never ever take out."}
{"text":"The beef medallions are out of this world. Don't hold back they're worth every penny. Also the drink. W sour was just as amazing"}
{"text":"Brandi was a great server! It was everyone in our party's first time at this restaurant. She took the time to go over all of our concerns and questions and made an amazing recommendation. The manager even came to our table and presented us with a coupon for brunch. Very thoughtful for them to do that. The food was delicious!! A ton of food for the money."}
{"text":"This place is just excellent and their food is delicious and the Apple crostada is out of this world. Favorite dish is the rustic chicken n shrimp"}
{"text":"The ambiance was so cozy. I ate pasta with chiken and my husband chose chiken with epinard. It was soooo delicious. Yummy"}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and gave good service. My lasagna was quite tasty and others liked their entrees for the most part. One friend said her pasta was watery though. The location was great if you are seeing a show across the street or are enjoying the mall.

FYI - The food was good enough, but it was frustrating they didn't participate in giving points with the lettuce entertain you card."}
{"text":"Beware the move up!

I took my son there for spaghetti and walked out with a $91 bill.  What!  Two of the nicest young servers I could imagine sold me up on appetizers, entrees and desserts so quickly that my head is still spinning.  The food was not the best Italian food, but it was excellent.  The service was incredible, the best of any restaurant I have visited.  I love/hate those two kids.  

Oh.  I have a tip for them.  Warm your plates!  My entree didn't have much mass and was cooling down rapidly.  I touched the edge of the plate and sure enough, it was cold.  Cold plates suck the energy out of food.  It's a basic!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had lunch, the portions were big & our server was really attentive and had a really great attitude. We ordered the Calamari which was absolutely phenomenal. 

I ordered the Surf and Turf, my steak was over cooked I ordered it medium rare and it came well done which is very disappointing but the lobster was delicious. 

My girlfriend ordered Rigatoni D, and I must say it was by far way better than my steak it's nice an creamy I definitely recommend it as well."}
{"text":"Food was great and quickly served as we were in a hurry. The chef helped us with the selection as well due to food allergy concerns."}
{"text":"Dining at Maggiano's has become a Thanksgiving tradition for us and this year proved to be better than last!  It's amazing that the staff can be so welcoming and positive when they're working and away from their families for the holiday!  The service is definitely 5-star and the food was plentiful and delicious.  I would highly recommend Maggiano's for lunch or dinner any day of the year!"}
{"text":"For a chain Italian restaurant this place is head and shoulders above them all. Great food, good portion size and great service from the front to the back of the house. Keep up the good work and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this place and which we could go more often, it is well worth the quick drive over to Scottsdale.  I enjoy my Pesto Ravioli, and my girlfriend loves her Rigatoni D with mushrooms along with a nice glace of wine and for me a Peroni.  I also like that they will have guest chef's and dishes inspired by different people.  During October they had a pumpkin ravioli dish which was to die for, it wasn't over done as some pumpkin dishes can be and I can't wait and hope that they bring it back next season!  The ambiance and the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture inside and outside with the giant spire is amazing.  They have 3 customizable rooms to rent out including a bar as well as an upstairs area of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was the best thing I've ever eaten. The cheesecake was absolutely the best slice of my life. The service was spectacular. If I could give this place a thousand stars, I would do it again and again."}
{"text":"Another extraordinary dinner at Maggiano's, Summerlin Las Vegas!  A restaurant is as great as its staff and delicious menu.  This oasis is exceptionally appointed with gracious and efficient staff, especially Jennifer, and of course, Luigi- the GM, both who are extremely professional and attentive to every need. Maggiano's Carbonara and Saltimbocca are not to be missed, traditional and delicious!  Take note, their dessert menu is beyond belief and exceptional in every way.  Not only is this restaurant nestled in a beautiful environment, it prides itself on delicious and extensive menu!  The feeling, while dining, is \"Come home to a delicious, traditional Italian family dinner!\"  The bar area, with beautiful views, is perfect for a quick wine and dine as well. There is also a separate dining area for parties, large or small, beautifully designed to create a most beautiful dining experience. Ample parking areas for all to use are readily available! Call and make a reservation ti be sure to insure a seating of your choice.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Been to Maggiano's many times. The food and service are excellent. I'd recommend reservations for busy times as they get very busy, and deservedly so!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's would never be a place I would choose for date night  - when I am in the mood for Italian I would much rather go to a small locally owned place like Toscano.  

However, for special events or group dining (corporate dinners, seminars, or large family dinners)  this place is great.  I have been here at least half a dozen times for corporate dinner meetings and seminars and they really do an excellent job serving groups. 

There are a couple of ballrooms upstairs which open up if you need a large space.  There is enough room to set up a bar in the ballroom for cocktails before dinner. 

The nice thing about doing the \"family\" style dining with groups is you can have a couple of different entrees circulating each table. They typically bring out several different side dishes - veggies, pasta, etc as well.  I find the food to be average - nothing to write home about - but typical of a large corporate chain.

I have to say, service on each of my visits has been excellent. So, if you are looking for a good venue for a group dinner, give them a call!"}
{"text":"Place is not what I expected. Yes it's huge and nice inside but the food wasn't so good and the customer service was terrible. If I was I'm scottsdale I wouldn't consider this place at all. I love Italian food but this is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Yummm SO GOOD!!! 
Stopped here post Rock N Roll 10k....yet another decision made while in Vegas. We shared appetizers and had a celebratory drink. 
Italian sausage flatbread... delicious!! I need that as a large size pizza. Crust thin & crisp all the ingredients held up on their own without compromising the crust. Perfect!
Steamed mussles. Nice, fresh, plump mussles mixed with white beans, gave them an added creamy touch! Yes! 
The third app were the stuffed mushrooms. They were good, but was missing something in the stuffing, maybe some sort of cheese...the spinach and bread crumbs were more mushy and added nothing to the mushrooms. 
It was nice to sit out on the patio and watch the rest of the runners cross the finish line. 
When in Vegas I will definitely consider this a place to come back and grab a drink or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place the ambience and food is the qaulity a five star restaurant but the prices are 10-15 a plate on average. Definitely recommend this place and it is especially good for a date."}
{"text":"We came here with a large party of 12, reservations of course. Great service, they were attentive and engaged. Appetizers consisted of fresh bread, olive oil and balsamic, spinach dip, calamari.  Everything is fresh delicious.  Various dishes were ordered, I heard the meatball sub was awesome, the rigatoni rich with chicken caramelized onion and Marsala sauce was superb, salads are fresh, desserts are better!  Ambience is nice, decor is lovely white table cloth, deep rich wood interior and lighting - really nice."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Really good food.  Otstandly amazing desserts.  

The GOOD...
Chicken park definitely better than most.  No knife needed, big portion.

Carbonara was rich, garlicky good but the pancetta in it was a little under and fatty.  Kicked a few pieces to the side.

The SO SO
The Crispy Pepporoni Rissoto bites.  How do you not try that right?  We did, they were okay but won't order again.

The Sugar Snap Peas w/Bacon.  Bacon greasy and overcooked.  Pretty small portion.  Sugar Snap Peas were highlight

The BOMB
Spinach Artichoke dip was super creamy, great garlic taste, bread was perfect size and heated properly.  This tops Oreganos boom dip for sure.  Although boom dip has a hint of heat that is missing here but I still prefer this one.

The chocolate zuccatto? Cake.  OMG the filling and cake are the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  Piece is huge too. 

The Nona pound cake was awesome too.  Cake came seemed to have crystallized sugar that added something nice and different with vanilla ice cream, hot fudge and warmed crystallized bananas.  It so did not suck.  If I had to choose only one it would be the chocolate cake.  Been wanting it again since.

Outstanding service.  Table visits fro chef for a tasting, the GM with goody bag and attentive wait staff.  Really 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a \"buyer beware\" restaurant!

When a customer takes a bite then returns a dish because it's not good, the restaurant doesn't happily take it back... then charge for it anyway. Right? Not normal, Maggiano's - especially for a supposedly established chain upscale restaurant. (It was soggy bow-tie pasta a/ spinach, btw.  Ick. Exchanged for Pizza-Hut quality spaghetti marinara, though they still charged for the more expensive bow-tie - we balked, but they would not budge. Supposedly it came from the kitchen or management, the nice waitress still got our normal 18% tip.)

Bad taste in my mouth from a bland dish and dirty rotten maneuver. First and last time, thank you.

UPDATE: After a whole lot of nudging they apologized and fixed the difference on my credit card.  They also said they were sending a little \"gift\".  Well, now it's been three months and nothing ever arrived.  

So for same reason -- careless lack of regard / seriousness for customer service -- STARS UNCHANGED.

The customer service training at this outfit just is rather careless, and that doesn't feel good.  Very nice people, everyone I interacted with, but they lack common classy restaurant business sense.  Maybe it's Vegas culture and I'm used to L.A. and midwest?  I do sense there's a weird thing going on in Vegas service culture.  Anyway, I'm ragging on their manners, but two-stars also reflects the quality of food, it's really quite unremarkable.  Interior modern but likewise absolutely unremarkable.

(BUT, and this was nice, a guy goes around and sings to your table.  Don't know if that's regular.  Normally would have earned a star for that ;)"}
{"text":"Host seemed confused about where to seat us... my glass was dirty... I could barely understand our waiter... my food was lukewarm... our request for fresh parmesan cheese was met with a shaker of the white powdery stuff.  

Why, oh why, do I venture into chain restaurants?"}
{"text":"Wow!  Wow!  Wow!
Great Food!  Great Service!  Great Ambiance!
We were looking for a place to take our father for his 78th birthday dinner.  He loves Italian.  Though Maggiano's is a chain, this location beats all of the other locations we have visited.  The waiter (Nester) was terrific.  We decided to do the Classic Family Style.  There was almost too much food for all of us.  Each course and entree was delicious.  Calamari was perfect.  Steamed mussels were awesome.  Caesar Salad was bountiful and a good palate cleanser before the entrees.  Peppercorn Beef, Salmon, Chicken Piccata, and Linguine with red clam sauce were all perfect together.  But remember you have two desserts coming so make some room.  On this particular evening they had a gentlemen playing the violin.  He came over and serenaded our father with Happy Birthday.  Bottom line Father loved it all. Thanks Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of chain places mostly because the food lacks love and atmosphere seems fake.  But if there's a chain place that does it right, it would have to be Maggiano's.  The food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial.  And their Las Vegas location is no exception.

The Maggiano's Salad and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake are a must try.

What was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine I had.   I usually find it difficult to smell what I'm suppose to smell in red wine: hints of strawberries, cherries, oak, vanilla, leather, sunshine, earth, wind, fire, etc, whatever.  Not this time: I smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red.  I was so shocked that I was practically snorting instead of drinking it.
The only reason I stopped was I heard our waiter ask, \"Is everything okay, sir?\"  And as I looked up from my glass to answer, I saw the wife shaking her head with the \"What are you doing?\" look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk.
I placed my glass down and responded, \"We're fine.  Thank you.\"
I should've responded with \"This wine may have gone sour.  Could you please bring me something else?\"  But then he would have taken the only wine I could smell properly."}
{"text":"Always make a reservation, it's super quick and easy on open table! I came here for a quick dinner with my man on a Sunday. It was pretty busy, and it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come over and greet us after we were sat. When I've already completely decided my meal before I've even been offered a drink, I get a little impatient. That's the only reason I knocked a star off. The food came out within 20 minutes or so after we ordered, and we split chicken piccata, but unfortunately they didn't split it. I don't mind paying a split charge, especially when I specifically request a split. The size was ok, only 3 very small chicken breasts, but Macaroni Grill has definitely made us spoiled with portion sizes. I would return, as it was a nice atmosphere at a good price with decent service and yummy Italian food."}
{"text":"Food is really good, price is very reasonable for that quality and quantity.  The chicken pesto and bruschetta were delicious. It wasn't too heavy like other Italian restaurant that I've tried. 
Service is great, and the atmosphere is good too. I love the booth, it's very comfortable.
The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star is because I was a little disappointed at the cleaniness of this place the second time I went there. I figured there was a kid sitting in our booth before us and the floor and seats were full of crumbs and very dirty. Seriously? the booster seat was still under the table...
Other than that, this place is very good, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's day and we were very disappointed. The restaurant was not busy, there were quite a few open tables. Our server was nice but his service was off. I asked for a drink menu and he told me the only thing special they had was a sangria. He brought us the wrong salad and took forever to refill our drinks. He didn't bring us bread until we were almost finished with our appetizers. Two of our entrees looked great. The chicken fettuccine alfredo looked disgusting. The plate wasn't wiped down around the edges and the sauce, what little there was, looked like it had been sitting for a while. There also was no garnish and the whole dish looked messy. Sad because I've dined here before and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant.......only had one some what bad experience and that's when some dust fell from the ceiling vent onto my table.....waitress promptly apologized and cleaned up the area"}
{"text":"So we're in a new city and we end up at Maggiano's for lunch, which we have right in our own backyard in Chicago...yet never go! But hey it did a trick yesterday becuase I wanted a salad and I knew Maggiano's could (and they did) deliver a very good salad.

My fiance got the calamari (grilled instead of fried)...we're both calamari lovers and while he ate it all (and I had a few bites) this was just ok.  However, my cesar salad was very good and just like everything at Maggiano's it was absolutely huge. 

I'm sure there are better restaurants in Cleveland for Italian, but if you find yourself at Beachwood Place and don't feel like eating Chick-fil-A or other food court food make your way down to Maggiano's."}
{"text":"Dinner here was awesome. The ambiance , the service, and most of all the food and wine. Just excellent! Portions are def well portioned for the price and the prices are a deal when it comes to [portion and most of all taste! The fresh bread they bring out is also a winner! Try not to over eat on the bread and salad though because the dish itself you need to save room for and also the desert!  The pasta list also gives you options for gluten free or wheat as well for those who prefer. They also have a great alcohol selection and assist you in helping find a wine that best fits your meal that night. Definitely a great spot to eat and you can park inside of fashion show mall so there is a ton of parking!"}
{"text":"I went here for my sisters birthday, with 5 adults 2 kids and an infant. The food was ok but the service was extremely horrible, we were here at 1 p.m. there was 5 other tables in the restaurant filled the rest was empty, I would assume they would give us decent service for the price of the food but that is asking way to much."}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here at the Borolo room. It was great for a small 15 person gathering. The prices were great at about  $30/person for lunch. My guests loved the food and had a great time. There was also a small side table where I set up the wedding cake. I also brought in chair sashes and the staff was nice enough to volunteer to set them up for me, which was a great help. Maggiano's is great, especially if there are people in your party who are vegetarian."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to get some good Italian food on our boys trip out of town so we decided to stop by Maggiano's.  My two friends had been to the location in Costa Mesa so we figured we would have a great meal.

The restaurant fits into the neighborhood very well with all sorts of great artwork and beautiful architecture blending a great Chicago style building to the Scottsdale desert.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and were able to get a table right away.

The waitress was very friendly and gave us some recommendations for food and drinks.  She was very friendly and attentive the whole experience and I wish I could remember her name to put in this post, but she was amazing!

I ordered the (I can't remember the actual name) lemon chicken and my friends ordered some stuff they said was good, but I couldn't recall much because I was too interested in the amazing dish I was served.  This was by far the best lemon chicken I've ever had in my life!  Sorry honey, yours is good too, but this was amazing!  I barely remember the conversation that happened during the meal.  Even though I was full I wanted ten more plates of lemon chicken!

During our visit we were lucky to have the !!!General Manager of the restaurant (Andrea) come by and talk with us.  She talked to us about the restaurant and her story of how she became the General Manager. I was able to tell her how much I loved the food and she surprised us by bringing the Head Chef Jenna to the table.  Jenna told us she had the opportunity to make our meal herself; so I was able to actually thank the chef that made my food!

The whole experience was all too surreal like out of a movie, but I can't wait to go back to experience the lemon chicken once again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a chain Resturant. Has a family feel with nice decor. Portions are huge! Come hungry. You can't go wrong with anything in the menu. But exactly for those counting calories. Solid wine menu to boot."}
{"text":"Went back to Maggiano's today...exactly 1 week after my 1st visit. It was busier than last week, but the service was just as good! 
Mattie sat us and was very friendly. She recommended some of her favs as well. Our server (Penny) was attentive and professional. Always there BEFORE the beverages ran out. Very friendly and bubbly. I like that.
The food was great again. I'm really impressed with this location and the staff."}
{"text":"We were really surprise by how busy this restaurant at the mall was, we arrived hungry and ready to eat at 6pm thinking that we would get seated right away but it was packed!  30 minute wait which is not too bad.  

The food was delicious, the linguine frutti de mares was excellent, extra large portion with extra mussels, clams, lobster, and a kick of spices, which is appetizing for a hot summer night.  I wanted a lighter fare so I ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good.  I did order grilled scallops for my main course, but I think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked...to the point of being stringy and hard.  The manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house.  At that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined.  I think it was just an oversight on such a busy night.  Beside this incident, we really enjoyed our meal at Maggiano, service was excellent, food was delicious, ambiance was authentic and on point.  If you're craving for some real authentic italian food, this place is a great option."}
{"text":"Loved the service by Drew! I frequent Maggianos restaurants in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and if you can ask for Drew when visiting the Summerlin, NV location. Loved the Salmon Oscar it was so delicious and full of flavor, I usually order crab cakes all the time. Drew was able to accommodate us and help us order the salad that is usually served alongside the crab cakes which is so simple yet delicious. The brownie dessert is rich and flavorful  and you can't go wrong with butter cake! They have a small selection of Merlots but they are of great quality. My favorite is the Tangley Oaks."}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta ! Excellent wine! And food is amazing.  Jose was our server. He is great !"}
{"text":"I usually prefer mom and pop Italian joints rather than overpriced chains, so dining at Maggiano's was not my choice but a colleague's. One dinner visit was enough to change my mind about this place though, their service was stellar and the menu was more reasonably priced than I expected with Italian-family-size portions. I found myself back here within a week for lunch. 

The classic chicken parmesan is easily enough for two, with two huge cutlets topped with mozz and marinara plus a side of spaghetti. If you're planning to share, add on the house salad to round things out. My \"light\" chicken francese is not the best version of this dish I've found, but if I hadn't specified the low-cal version I wouldn't necessarily have known, as the lemon-butter sauce still tasted pretty rich. The chicken marsala, a coworker's go-to, was so good that it's all she'll get here. I tried the sauce and made a mental note to come back for it but would probably request extra mushrooms.

I still find myself more likely to suggest a quieter local business, but now that I'm more familiar with the Maggiano's brand and menu, it's a dining spot I'll suggest when looking for eats in the downtown Summerlin area.

TIP: If you were also under the misimpression that this place is pricey, join their email list. I now get discount coupons weekly. Literally, weekly."}
{"text":"Tooo much food.  Can't... breathe...

I'm not sure if it was just our wonderful hyper foodie waiter, or if they treat all their customers this way, but dinner became an EVENT.  He insisted that every dish was bottomless. 

We did the Classic Family Dinner:

3 Appetizers:
   - Spinach & Artichoke al Forno - Very rich, creamy, and flavorful
   - Sausage & Peppers - Delicious, but why is this an appetizer??  
   - Bruschetta - Great flavor, but eat it fast or the lovely buttery bread gets soggy and ruins the fun.
*BONUS App compliments of the chef for being a new customer?*
   - Crispy Zucchini Fritte -  How on earth did they make it so breaded and crispy?  I make fried zucchini all the time and it never turns out this good...

4 Main Courses: 
   - Beef Tenderloin Medallions - FANTASTIC!  It was served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and topped with crispy thin onion rings. YUM!
   - Chicken Parmesan - Nice and crispy.  Just your basic Chicken Parm!
   - Chicken Tortelloni - Eh, not great.  Maybe it was the intense flavors of all the other foods that made this taste so bland, but It wasn't our favorite.
   - Spaghetti & Meatballs - There is actually only one giant meatball.  That \"s\" at the end is misleading!  Tasted good, not the best spaghetti I've had, but did its spaghetti duties.

2 Desserts: 
   - Strawberry Pie (Special of the day) - I thought I had no room left, but I still scarfed this down.  Light and perfectly sweet.
   - Apple Crostada - AMAZING.  So crispy and delicious.  Warm under a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly.

I'm pretty sure I need to say some prayers and ask forgiveness for my gluttony.  I blame our server.  He kept sneaking more food on our table to \"give us our money's worth\".  

I think I need another nap."}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's on a Thursday evening with my family because we were all having a  rough week. Our waitress, Maggie, was bomb. She was delightful, picked out an excellent wine for me and was on point with everything.  The food and the service are great. Thanks Maggiano's! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious food.   I ordered the Caesar salad and chicken franchese.  Wife ordered the house salad and chicken Alfredo light style.   Both dishes were cooked perfectly and was tasty.  The complimentary bread was also fresh and good."}
{"text":"My family of 5 made reservations over the phone and were seated minutes after arriving had an amazing dinner here last night. The atmosphere and service was great. Our waiter Cisco was very atentive. Our glasses never went empty. His personalty and energy was on point. He is the type of person I would want working for me. We ordered two  dinner for 2 and omg we got so much food. It came with an appetizer 2 main entrees  and a desert. We ordered fried zucchini, Alfredo, chicken parmesian and cheese cake.  The zucchini was fried perfect, came out with a cream sauce yum. The chicken Alfredo was on point. I personally liked the chicken Alfredo.  And the cheesecake was so fluffy and light. Looking forward to another dinner here."}
{"text":"My bestie and I came here on our Trip to Vegas. We were looking for some comfort food to eat and we didn't want to go too high end but somewhat nice and friendly. We just walked in here by chance. Most of the dishes are meant to be family style, therefore, the pasta we ordered was enough for two and we shared a tower of the shortcake. The shortcake was cool 'cause it was house made cream, strawberries and marbled pound cake. Pasta was good. The customer service was amazing and friendly including from the managers who came up and checked to make sure everything was okay. It's the one place on the Strip that was actually reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday evening @ the Summerlin location, although there was a 30 minute wait we were seated promptly.  Our server greeted us immediately and offered the drink menu & bread. Once we received our drink orders Benny ( our waiter ) ask if we had any allergies at our table -hallelujah- this is always a good sign! After explaining our allergies, to my surprise the head chef came to our table to go over the menu and explained how he could make most anything,  substituting certain ingredients with others- what a surprise! This typically only happens at fine dining. Our food was excellent, and our waiter Benny was not only friendly but an excellent waiter!"}
{"text":"Love their lighter fare option! While yes, Maggianos is known for their large portions and ahem, rich (calorie laden) flavors, this was a nice surprise. I had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it! I didn't think any of the flavor was lost, but yes, the portion was a bit smaller than what I'm used to there. However, it was still filling.

Hubby had the linguini de mare, which was really good (not lighter fare). We started with the Maggiano salad (him) and Italian salad (me) and both really enjoyed our respective orders.

We shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish! 

Our server was Seidi and I highly recommend asking for her section. We eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"The pasta for the price at Maggiano's just can't be beat!  I went with my Mom and her sister and my bf (Chris L.) last week while in Vegas.  I shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with Chris L. and my Mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp.  The corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten-free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesn't cut it.  I love that a serious Italian restaurant cares about the wheat-free side of life and offers wheat-free options.  I also love that a serious Italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank.

The wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good--I got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert would've been divine if it weren't for the profiterole....  The two baby boomers at the table each got the (GF) creme brulee and loved it.

So, for what Maggiano's is, I'm giving it 5 stars.  It certainly beats the other \"cheap\" food of Vegas and the price is so much better than the expensive restaurants there.  That's a win-win in my book."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite italian restaurant in Vegas. It feels like you just wanna be with your family when you come here. Eggplant parmesan with meat sauce is one of my faves. I wouldn't normally order fried calamari at any other restaurant but it's the first thing I wanna order when I get here. It's light and not chewy which I looove! My son eats up most of his spaghetti and can't get enough. Mama's lasagna is pretty mean too. I'm looking forward to trying other stuff on the menu. but all i can think about is the eggplant parm!"}
{"text":"Took Toots out for Saturday brunch today.  Open Table reservations worked as advertised.  We were promptly seated and selected the $2 mimosas as we perused the menu.  Brunch selections as well as full menu choices were available.  We chose Benedict's, I got the crab and Toots the smoked ham. Both were excellent.  Before they arrived, Chef Robert Sanchez arrived at our table to introduce himself and present us an amuse bouche, a very nice touch. With Sinatra through the speakers and red and white checked tablecloths Maggiano's has the ambiance for fine dining for couples and families, of which there were many in attendance."}
{"text":"Our experience at Maggiano's wasn't bad, but it wasn't good; it was just kind of meh. 

The biggest issue plaguing the evening was the incredibly loud dining room with no ambient music to help people regulate their volume. The second biggest issue was the stretched too thin service; it wasn't inattentive, but frantic and rushed. 

The drinks were decent; but their happy hour is incredible! I will definitely stop in again for the half price (selected) drinks and cheap bar bites. 

The food was unfortunately pretty hit or miss. For appetizers, Taylor and I tried their assortment of bruschetta; this was undoubtedly the best dish of the evening. The shrimp one was my favorite and also the most unique in my opinion. I have to say, I think the Italian Beef bite didn't have the Fontina cheese it was supposed to but it didn't phase Taylor. We also had a Caesar salad- average at best. 

Taylor also really enjoyed his chicken meatball, mozzarella, sundried tomato, and pesto fettuccine. My entree wasn't as impressive. I ordered their \"famous rigatoni \"D\"\"; it was served in an undersized bowl, swimming in an ocean of bland, under reduced cream sauce with no Marsala flavor, the mushrooms were whole and undercooked, and the caramelized onions were cut to a small dice- not thin sliced like generally expected when an item features caramelized onion. The roasted chicken was the only redeeming part- tender and flavorful. I tried, but couldn't attempt to enjoy more than a couple bites. 

Our server was understanding and brought back a menu to pick something else. We had a show less than an hour away, so I didn't want to order another full entree worried it would take too long and we would be rushing to the show. I enjoyed the bruschetta so I figured go with a sure thing at this point and asked about the house salad's base- \"is it mixed greens?\"   \"Yes\".  \"ok, I'll have that\". It was not mixed greens. Same romaine from the Caesar (and I assume the same on the chopped salad where it makes more sense). Despite expecting a different salad, the house dressing was really great and the crispy pancetta was even better. 

Overall, I don't think I'll be joining them for a nice dinner and relaxed evening, but I'll give their happy hour a try and hope they can redeem themselves a bit."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant! We arrived with a group of 9, including two small children, and they were able to accommodate room for our strollers. The wait was not long l, considering that it was noon and the lunch rush had just started. Their kids menu was reasonable and delicious!"}
{"text":"After I left this place I felt very fat.  That's a good thing!  Anyways, we ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees just for my wife and I.  BIG MISTAKE!  We should definately shared a entree.  The portions were huge!  We had the stuffed mushrooms and mussles for the appetizers.  They were great.  I had the chicken parm and she had the chicken marsala.  They were bothe great also.   But like I said, we should of just shared a entree."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service was excellent.  The Server was really nice and put a positive outlook on all the dishes while highlighting what she liked best on the menu.  My wife ordered the Filet with a \"medium\" finish and it came back closer to \"well-done\".  She said the risotto did not have much taste to it.  I had the Denver Steak as I wanted steak, potatoes and vegetables.  The steak was done to perfection and the taste was pretty good.  The Vegetables were excellent.  Not sure why restaurants tend to go overboard on mashed potatoes with a ton of garlic and butter.  I like both but let's taste the potato too.  My review went from 5 to 4 with the over-done on the Filet and the over garlic/butter on the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I've been to Summerlin Maggiano's several times and have always had good food and a good experience. However, yesterday late afternoon, I took my sister-in-law and brother-in-law (visiting from New York) and my 14 year old grandson. 
WHAT A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE!
My brother-in-law had the linguini with clam sauce. It was served without or with very little sauce. He asked the server(Silvia) to bring more sauce. She did, but by that time, the pasta was cold
My sister-in-law and I ordered the eggplant parmigiana. Both of us agreed that it was just edible. I gave it a 2 and she gave it a 3
Now for the thing that really irked me. 
3 of us ordered the buy one get one
My take home order was the mushroom ravioli and I got a pan of spaghetti. See picture. That is not even one of the choices. Why that was given instead of the mushroom ravioli, I have no 
I would have given this restaurant a 0; however, the bread was delicious, and my 14 year old enjoyed his fettuccine. 
We might have been there at an off time, but it was a very bad experience especially since it cost be $140.00

UPDATE:
Yesterday, I went back to Maggiano's and was extremely satisfied with the service and food. I spoke to the manager, Brittany, who was very generous to us. Our server, Crystal was great- attentive and very pleasant 

The food was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their meals. There was chicken Marsala, shrimp scampi, and chicken parmigiana.  Excellent taste and lots of shrimps!  The chicken parmigiana had a little too much sauce for my liking, but very tasty when I took off some sauce. 

Everything was great, and I'm really glad I went back. I love the ambiance of this place!"}
{"text":"The service is kinda slow, but the food is good. 
Hope you can do it more faster and quick."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I absolutely love maggionos. But I will say that the one at fashion is just better. Now, I did come the 2nd night it opened because I love this place, service was great, but the food just wasn't as good. Hubbys chicken parm was rubbery and oily, and my spaghetti and meatball wasn't as spectacular as normal. Place is pretty cramped. Tried to come here yesterday again bu the wait for 2 was an hour on Saturday night. I'll come here again, but it may be worth the drive to fashion show"}
{"text":"I love maggionos! I always try to find a reason to dine here. Chicken parm is good, meatball and spaghetti is great, and their red sauce just makes it that much better. Calamari is really yummy, not overly breaded or chewy. Lunch menu has a good chicken parm sandwich. Salads are good, fresh and deliccious dressings... Now the hot bread they serve....... I could eat this bread all night with their cheese and balsamic.  It's good they bring it out in small 4-5 rolls because I would have rolls for days...... on my thighs..... I do wish there was a location off the strip in summerlin somewhere.... weekend wait times are terrible, so get a reservation. The fried zucchini is one of the best I've ever had with ranch BUT it's just too big to share between two people. Eat here. Just do it. Oh and they usually have a musician walking around asking if you want them to play something if your into that sort of stuff."}
{"text":"I had organized a large group that met for a week long conference in Las Vegas and Maggiano's was amazing when it came to being very accommodating. We started with a party of 12 which became 13. I was able to update it on the phone with no issue. Being a large group, we had to order Family Style and choose our menu items prior to the meal. I had one person gluten-free (celiac), one low-carb, and two that could not eat mushrooms. To say choosing items was a challenge would be true, however, the crew at Maggiano's didn't even bat an eyelash at this! The chef that evening came out to verify our menu and speak with our friend that required gluten-free. The chef was able to make side plates of what was ordered just for him so it was safe. He even mentioned that the fried prosciutto that came on the Chopped Salad would not be safe for him because it's prepared near gluten products, so he would prepare a separate bowl anyway for him - something we didn't know about even though I had verified the dish did not come with any gluten-based items. The meal was delicious and very filling. I took back to my hotel room the remains of the braised beef contadina - beautiful slow cooked beef that fell apart in your mouth. I was worried folks would want more, but we had a few platters with food left on them. Wine selection was excellent and I had an after dinner espresso that reminded me of my first in Italy years ago. The tiramisu was delicious and I wished I had the platter of it all to myself.  The space is beautiful and even more so since they had decorated for Christmas. There were other large groups so it was a bit loud and made conversations a bit difficult. I would definitely return here with a smaller group to be able to enjoy the cozy ambiance better. Overall, I loved dining at Maggiano's and would return. I wish there was one in Portland, OR!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it doesn't have 5 stars already--this place has some of the best Italian I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was excited to see they have gluten free pasta and all of their sauces are gluten free since I can't eat gluten anymore.  I asked multiple times if my dish can be made with gluten free pasta and was told yes.  I finished my lunch and realized after leaving that it was gluten free pasta.  I have a serious reaction to gluten.  Don't offer gluten free pasta if you are going to ignore my request."}
{"text":"Craving Mom's Lasagna and a chopped salad so went down to the strip for some good food.  Arlene was our server and she ticked all the boxes.  Extremely accommodating by going above and beyond.  Loved her service and friendliness.   Robert the manager stopped by the table and brought us some complimentary bruschetta.   Thank you for an enjoyable dining experience.  We'll continue to come back and recommend your establishment."}
{"text":"It's rare that I pick a chain restaurant especially for a special event like the big \"30\" but I am so happy I did.  I made reservations for a party of nine the staff was very friendly and seated us promptly.  I've eaten at several other Maggianos in the past and have always had great food but it had been some time so I was hoping I would not be disappointed.  

I must say the entire party left with full bellies and big smiles.  They have this ridiculous deal on their menu right now when you order one signature pasta dish you get one free to take home.  It doesn't even have to be the same dish that you ordered.  Now this restaurant knows how to bring people in during these tough economic times. 

* on a side note the dirty martini's were amazing!"}
{"text":"My family dined here for a birthday celebration - it was superb! The restaurant ambiance is elegant and upscale. The service is phenomenal and the food was delicious! The price wasn't bad but it wasn't cheap. I will be back!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The family enjoyed a wonderful meal this afternoon. The only criticism I may have is the way the creme brulee was prepared \"to go\".  See the attached pictures."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday evening.  It is a very pretty location, and service was  good.  I really didn't care for the food, however.  The bread with the oil and parmesan cheese was good, but I didn't care for the sauce on the pasta.  It just had a weird flavor to me. My son liked his chicken parmesan so I guess I would have to get that if we went back."}
{"text":"Celebrated our anniversary at Maggiano's in Summerlin.  We've been to the Fashion Show mall location many times.  Fashion Show decor is very elegant where Summerlin decor is modern and more casual.  The food is excellent at both locations.  We were seated and a Happy Anniversary card signed by staff on the back, was prominently placed on our table - presumably for the servers and others to see.  It is more than a card, however; when you take it back on your next visit, you may have a complimentary dessert.  While that is a gimmick to get you back, I'll take it!  The food is great and I rarely order dessert when eating out.  The two desserts we had were fabulous!

Our server, Maggie, was fabulous. She greeted us right away and showed the new menu with the pull out specials. Later, the manager also greeted us and wished us a Happy Anniversary as well.  Maggie was very friendly and pleasant with great suggestions for us including my vegetarian diet. I love gnocchi and had seen an email with May specials including a pesto gnocchi dish.  I am vegetarian and Maggie knew the broth was a chicken-base and asked the chef if it could be made vegetarian.  The chef even came out to verify what I could and could not eat as a vegetarian and said he would be making a parmesan broth.  The dish was delicious!  

Maggie made several suggestions for us as we considered trying the bruschetta.  We ordered two bruschetta each (pear and strawberry) from the bruschetta bar - both were yummy. We ordered the $42 special with salad, dinner, dessert to share and our entrees included the take another dish home and we each ordered my favorite eggplant parmigiana.  Maggiano's makes the best eggplant parmigiana ever and it is usually what I order - but this time I couldn't resist the gnocchi.   For our dessert we shared the limoncello tiramisu - which was heavenly - just the right amount of lemon and very light and fluffy.  Maggie also brought lemon cookies for our anniversary dessert with a chocolate Happy Anniversary written on the plate.  They were perfect too!  Very lemony and soft with a slight crust on them.

In the past, our anniversary or birthday dinners at the Fashion Show location were never noted by the staff - even though they ask when we book the reservation.  I think we had our picture taken once - but it was some ridiculous amount to purchase it.  The Summerlin location is definitely the best for service and we felt special celebrating our special day.  Great job Maggie and Maggiano's Summerlin!

I should add that Maggie was my all-time favorite server.  I travel for my work and eat in many establishments.  She was by far the best server; great suggestions, listened to our thoughts and ideas and made appropriate suggestions, checked up on us periodically - not too much, but just right; was always friendly and bubbly and really seemed to enjoy serving us.  If she is like this with all the patrons, she needs to teach others her skills."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place and I am sure glad she did! After a long day of travel, this place really hit the spot. The patio was nice in the evening and not too loud with street traffic. The calamari was delicious, as we the mushroom tortellini and eggplant parm. The food was rich, delicious and flavourful as very well priced, especially on the strip. 
The sangria pitcher was a little disappointing though. It had a ton of ice and the server put a ton of ice in our glasses as well. it really diluted the flavour."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Good food, good service and they gave us another free full dinner for each of us to take home. Prices were surprisingly reasonable too!  Looking forward to a repeat performance real soon!"}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years. Never been disappointed. I was here on May 9 and even on Tuesday it was packed. 

Pastas here are always good. And love the half and half Tiramisu Cake and Raspberry Cake for Desert."}
{"text":"Family style Italian Resturant in a nice more up scale yet casual setting. This is a chain Resturant but this location is located in Fashion Show Mall with drive up valet parking available on the side of the building to provide easy access. 

The drinks are good and the food is awesome. There are all sorts of Italian favorites and they are done right. A perfect place to take family out on the town for a nice dinner with a view of the stripe or a dinner date prices are fair and great portions of food. I will definatley come back!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's never disappoints, from the calamari & fried zucchini my spirits were lifted from the start..lol. The chopped salad with chicken and just the right amount of salad dressing was divine!!! GREAT NIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this joint.  Live music, huge portions of food.  A little pricey but then if you're in Scottsdale you aren't here to save money.....There is a second story which overlooks the music, which is pretty slick.  I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"If you're bad with directions, then this restaurant is a little hard to find. The restaurant looks pricey on the outside, but all items on the menu have very reasonable prices. A few days ago while me and my boyfriend were in Vegas, we decided to try out this restaurant. I got the 'light take Chicken Alfredo' and let me tell ya, with a little dash of pepper, it tasted amazing. The customer service was nothing short of amazing either. We were acknowledged by almost every employee. Our waitress refilled our glasses timely and was very courteous. She made our experience enjoyable. Maggiano's knows how to pick the right people for the job. Heather was an awesome waitress and her bubbly personality topped it off. I recommend this restaurant while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the food here!!   I am so glad they opened one up in Downtown Summerlin!  I've been to this location twice and it's been great. Completely packed all the time. It's really good and the food tastes great as well. 

Okay so here at the positives: 

1)Food tastes amazing.  The dishes are always consistent and I love Italian food 

2)Drinks are great here as well and I love the kids menus. 

3) banquet menus are THe BEst.  So much food and a great price for all the food you get. So glad we have our holiday dinner here!!


Negatives: 

1) expectations were not met when I called in to let them know I was having a huge party and wanted to \"pre-set\" our table with gifts. Reservations were at 7:15 and the lady who took my call told me to come in around 7 so that I can place gifts on the plates so I came in promptly at 7 with a big box full of gifts for everybody in our group. 

I told the receptionist and she said they still had to get our table ready and that our table still wasn't ready.  Come 7:15, not ready.  Come 7:30 still not ready.  About 7:40, our table was ready and it just ruined my whole surprise for my guests because we weren't sat and we even had reservations for our party of 11.  Sucked.  So, due to that experience, they get a 4 Star.  

Come on, get it right next time with planning or whatever so you can get my reservations right.  Especially when I call and tell you I'm trying to set it up for my party to make it look nice. 

Other than that, the staff was nice to take all our photos after our dinner since we all dressed up for the occasion."}
{"text":"All I want to know is this: WHY when I paid for the use of all 3 banquet rooms for a wedding was another event booked the same evening as my event? I Increased the amount spent on the event to cover ALL 3 Rooms together. We lost the use of one of the rooms. So tacky, unprofessional, greedy and flat out wrong. THINK ABOUT IT !!!!"}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the best Maggiano's experience I have had across three states.  When another reviewer claimed that  it was a \"step above the Olive Garden\" they were spot on.

My mother and I went here for Thanksgiving dinner while in Vegas avoiding family obligations.  We were able to make reservations online, which was fairly convenient and helped us avoid a long wait.  We were also able to order off of the special Thanksgiving menu, which was a great mix of the traditional Thanksgiving fare coupled with some Italian favorites.  They also brought you more of anything you wanted in spite of the original portions being humongous.  

Overall, our experience was nice and we talk of a repeat dodging of the manicness that is Thanksgiving with the inclusion of our Maggiano's experience."}
{"text":"Holy wow. We went to Maggiano's for dinner. I remember loving Maggiano's as a kid. The booth was covered in water and crumbs. I wiped it down. It wasn't a big deal. They are busy. Our table had a dark black long hair on it. My water had a bug in it. My wine glass has lipstick from someone else on it. They were out of the ribeye. But what finally broke the camels back was the 50 minutes it took before they asked what we wanted for dinner. And the 30 minutes it took to ask for a new wine glass. We left. I give one star because the waitress was truly very nice and most of the issues were not because of her. Thank goodness the Capital Grille was next door."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Maggiano's little Italy. My wife and I ordered Marco's meal. She ordered the Gnocchi and I ordered the chicken Parmesan. It came with one appetizer, one dessert, and Two full meals to take home with you.  It was an amazing meal for just over $50.  We look forward to the next time we get to come and join our great server Mellissa."}
{"text":"I have Celiac's disease, so when we sat down I asked for a gluten free menu. The waitress told me that the chef would be out to speak to me. After helping me with the menu, the chef then told me to have the waitress make a note on my order, and he would make my meal himself to ensure no cross contamination. I was very impressed with the level of service. The meal was good, too large for one person alone, but good."}
{"text":"Highest, absolutely, highest rating for everything (service, ambience, extremely authentic cuisine, value priced, great location, etc.) I can give.  Grandma was Calabrese so I know my southern Italian flavors and their Linguine di Mare absolutely NAILED it.  Mussels and shrimp were ultra fresh and steamed perfectly and the lobster sauce was tangy and awesomely complimented the pasta which was done but had a whisker of al-dente to it.  This dish at least would draw rave reviews in Reggio, Naples, or Messina.  Best meal I've had in years.  $26.50??  Easily worth $45.00.  A total must try in Vegas at least.  Holy COW is this place good..."}
{"text":"Good for groups! If there's at least 4 people dining, I recommend their family style menu. It depends on which one you choose, but you basically get 3 appetizers, 2 entrees with unlimited refills! Plus you get a dessert! 

I don't usually order salad but I love the Maggiano's salad as one of their appetizers. The stuffed mushrooms are good too. For pasta I recommend Rigatoni D for white sauce and Baked Ziti for red. You can't go wrong with their tiramisu either. But other than that, nothing else stood out for me. For a chain, Maggiano's is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here in the Barolo room and everything was fantastic! I was so pleased with everything-the decor, the food, the staff. It was excellent. We had an incredible server, Jean-Marc, who made it his mission for everything to be perfect. When we arrived I saw him through the window rechecking the table to make sure everything looked just right, he was wonderful.  In the Barolo room they only serve the steak house menu, which my husband and I were happy with. The food was amazing! Oftentimes at restaurants I find that certain dishes or courses are wonderful and others are just ok, but every course was fantastic. My guests are still raving about the incredible food. I recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We were shopping all day. I was TIRED & CRANKY. He knew I wanted to try out Maggiano's! 

We actually got a table & the food was excellent!! For what you pay- absolutely worth it. We couldn't finish & took the rest home! A warm & inviting place, everyone was SO friendly: staff & patrons alike! 

Definitely a must to check out! They have indoor/outside seating, either way, you have an amazing view of the strip!"}
{"text":"Good. Decent Italian food. Server a bit forgetful and slow. Bread is outstanding. Good size portions."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Maggiano's a higher rating!  The ambience of Maggiano's is awesome.  The lighting is perfect and the woodwork makes for the perfect classic Italian vibe.  Also, a huge plus for Maggiano's is the Classic Pasta menu.  For around $10, you get a meal there and a fresh packaged plate of your choice to take home.

Unfortunately though, the menu is extremely basic, the food is mediocre at best, and the service is sub par.  I have been to Maggiano's five or six times hoping that something will change, but to no avail.  I always leave feeling dissapointed that my experience wasn't something more.

Maggiano's is also notorious for having a long wait and then missmanaging wait times.  I've witnessed hosts getting chewed out on more than a few occasions.  My boyfriend and I even had our Open Table reservation cancelled without our knowing last minute by them!

Last, a bit of the charm was lost for me when I learned that they are managed by the same company as Chili's.  This was the nail in the coffin.  Just another Italian chain."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to this wonderful restaurant. Everything was above exceptional from the moment we entered to our departure! We were greeted right away by Brenda. She made the whole experience amazing!
We shared the mussels for an app, then went onto our entrees. My fiance enjoyed his manicotti and I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken! Sooo good! 
I wanted to take home a the broth from our app but we ate it all! lol
we are also impressed about the complimentary pasta dish which was the baked ziti.

I would like to recommend anyone wondering about Maggiano's to go and enjoy Brenda's hospitality! Amazing! She deserves the recognition for our time spent there! 
WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time to this Maggiano's... The first time we sat on the patio and I swear a cockroach bit my leg. SOOOOOO GROSS. I don't think that's the restaurant's fault... The interior appears very clean. Came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at 7pm but hadn't called to make a reservation. My boy and I got there a little early so we put our name down (wait was 30 mins, nbd) and took a seat at the bar. The bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an AWESOME drink for me. Moscato Mojito. Definitely try it!!

Within 10 minutes, our buzzer went off for our table. I brought it over with my still nearly full drank-drank but had to wait like 10 more minutes at the stand to be seated. I get that it was much faster than the 30 minute prediction... But don't tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand. Whatev. 

We were seated, our server said he'd be right with us. Our server came back and took our drink order. We ordered 3 of those moscato mojitos (one extra for our late friend lol). I'm telling you! Try it!!! Our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank-dranks. Server asked if we'd decided on our meals yet... Our friend just sat down.... Give us like 2 more minutes? Ok cool! He came back like 15 minutes later. With bread and oil. We ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil. He never brought it....

Meanwhile the table next to us had sat down 5 minutes after us and was being served their food. Again, I get that we were taking our time and our friend was late, WHATEV. But their server was ON IT. I was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar. It took him 12 seconds. I was so jealous of the table next to us. 

Food finally came like 30 minutes later and I was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and I agreed to share because it was \"enough for two\"... Maybe enough for two kids. My ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho. Our server came back 10 minutes later to ask if we needed anything. I was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him, I decided to pass fearing it would take too long. Just the check thanks! Ugh. That was another 10 minute ordeal. I don't recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said...

Overall, 3 stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty. Memorable I suppose but not for the right reasons. Food was good. Nothing to write home about but satisfying. Dranks were BOMB. I'll go back just for that Moscato Mojito! Better luck next time though, Maggiano's."}
{"text":"The food was just OK (a step up from The Olive Garden), but our server was phenomenal! Daniel at the Summerlin location was the best. He was super friendly and welcoming, and when I struggled to decide between two desserts he surprised me with both! The chef also came out to say hello with some complimentary bruschetta. I would go again."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group, and we dined family style. I am not a huge italian food fan, as I am allergic to dairy. I wasn't really looking forward to the dinner but it definitely exceeded my expectations! I shared with our waiter that I couldn't eat dairy and one of the chefs came out and personally presented me with dairy free options at each course. I felt very special and understood, not to mention completely satisfied and full at the end! The hospitality here made what is usually an unpleasant issue, something great! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Maggiano's... go for lunch, go for dinner... walk it off in the Fashion Show Mall and go back for dessert!

I know it sounds crazy, but get the full size portion of whatever you order for $3 more...  look at the menu - Spaghetti and Meatballs half size for 11.95 or full size for 14.95....  sure I could never dream of finishing it, but $3 we can eat it 2 more times next week and why not!"}
{"text":"Recently, a person I know claimed to love Italian food and this chain restaurant. They went off on a tirade about how much they loved this place. This review is for them, after our shared meal and suicide-inducing friendship. 

This new location is a shining example of the Maggiano's chain. The food choices and quality are the exact same as every other location, ensuring that there is literally NO variation in your dining experience. If they served burgers Ray Kroc would ejaculate in his grave. This chain has done a great job of attracting the Olive Garden crowd, then squeezing $5-$10 more per meal for decor and the perception of \"fancy\" dining. If they offered unlimited bread sticks, an 'all you can eat pasta night', and had 5 years of pasta sauce slopped on the floor it would be the spitting f***ing image. What do you expect from an Ameri-talian, red sauce smothered insult to a rich culinary heritage?  My fellow Americans, we should all be embarrassed that we've allowed this crime against the culinary arts to continue for as long as it has.  

If you're reading this review and challenge this comparison, ask yourself two simple questions. 1) Do you think this place is better because you dress nicer and expect a bigger bill, 2) If you personally wagered $1,000 of your cash to prove that you could discern Maggiano food versus Olive Garden, exactly how confident would you actually be?   That's what I thought. Back to the trailer park where you belong."}
{"text":"Here is my super gross Italian Tossed salad. its white iceberg lettuce and dressing. I'm paying 16 dollars for the worst salad I've ever had......ever!  thanks. I don't think I should be charged for this embarrassment. It's supposed to be romaine and arugula...... Mama Ricottas will be happy you will lose my business."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice and it was better the first time. This visit food was good, but not extraordinary. I had lobster carbonera. It was good, but not a true carbonara. Atmosphere is nice and prices are very reasonable. A nice break from getting rammed on the strip. Wine was pricey though. I would go back another time and give another chance."}
{"text":"We ate there during our last trip to Vegas. I loved their eggplant Parmesan. Nick our server was great. We ate outside on the patio. The service was great. The manager even stopped by to ask us how our food was. I loved their mist outside to cool us during the hot weather.
They don't offer the take one home meal like all other Maggiano's. I could've used it.
Nevertheless a great experience
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yeah
  This place rules.  Great food. Perfect service.  Decent prices.  Parking is non existent unless you park in the mall.  But so what.  The scratch menu is worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bread, wine, and entrees are awesome! I usually get the chicken parm, but I've tasted other dishes as well and they are just as good! Not badly priced!"}
{"text":"First of all, the mints were delicious! They sat us where we wanted to sit in a very short amount of time. 
The food was tasty and the service was great! The drinks were refilled in a timely manner and so was the bread. 
We had a great view of the strip! :) 

Again, I grabbed a handful of mints on my way out. Lol"}
{"text":"Was treated to dinner here by my mother-in-law. There were 5 people in our party. Appetizers of zucchini and calamari were great, dinner was decent, desserts were pretty good. Service was incredibly slow for drinks and dessert. The Pomegranate Martini is fabulous as was the warm apple dessert. I was sent home with the wrong \"take home pasta\", which normally wouldn't have been a big deal to me, except it wasn't good...barely edible version of what I had at the restaurant...this was dry, dry, dry chicken and raw asparagus fettuccine alfredo. Ambiance is nice, friendly waiter, semi-friendly hostesses."}
{"text":"Eating here created wonderful memories...from the amazing food, excellent service and romantic violinist , we had an evening to remember."}
{"text":"I went to this place on July 1st for my friends birthday and I loved the environment the service was completely amazing super polite and they were great when it came towards recommending specials and desserts. My friend ordered the New York steak and it was delicious the meat was nice and tender and super flavorful! I got the chicken parmesan which was nice and crispy! They let us know that all the food is made from scratch which I thought was good. I did call ahead and made a reservation which came in handy because it looked like they got busy. I also let them know in advance it was my friends birthday and at the end of the meal they brought him a little desert with a candle which I thought was really nice. I defiantly recommend this place and the environment was very intimate the view was nice"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a co-worker while we were in town for a training. It was within walking distance from our hotel and the menu looked good. (Thanks again Yelp!)

The inside was very pretty. The waiter was pretty quick to get us bread and take our drink order. They were fairly busy but they were fairly attentive.

I had the Gnocchi that was one of the weekly specials. It had chicken, lemon, spinach, olives, and mushrooms. It was very, very good. I ate almost all of it and was stuffed! My co-worker has a sausage and pasta dinner that she said was very good. I liked the bread and my co-worker liked the soda options on the menu.

The prices were fair for the amount of food (big servings!) and the quality of food. It seems like a good place for a date night or family celebration. I would go back if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"We came here from Beverly Hills, had a great time and the service was incredible pleasant.   Our serve was Mike, he was the best server we have ever had, since I've been going out to resturants.  Highly recommend this resturant.   SERVICE FROM BEGGING TO THE END AMAZING"}
{"text":"This was probably the best place we ate in Vegas.  Unbelievable Italian food with a beautiful atmosphere and view!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a chain restaurant gal but I must say, Maggiano's definitely came through last night! I was craving some pasta and the bf wanted a filet and we didn't want to drive downtown so we settled on Maggiano's which has both offerings. For it being a Monday night, the place was packed, we were told it would be a 25 minutes wait so we decided to check out some stores in the mall while we waited. We came back and had to wait another 10 minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar. I enjoyed the house red which was smooth and tasty. We were shown to our table and somehow lucked out with one of the large booths against the walls which in my opinion are the best seats in the house. We ordered the Bruschetta as an appetizer, it was very simple yet flavorful and fresh. For entrees, the bf decided that all the pastas looked too good to not try one so he had the sausage gnocchi and I had the crab and shrimp cannelloni. Both were exceptional! I did have to wait about 10 minutes for my dish to cool off, it was that hot which gave me ample time to sneak a few bites of the bf's dish and it was awesome! For dessert we had the Limoncello pie which was yummy and refreshing as well as the Zuccato Cake which was chocolate cake with Sambuca flavored mousse.  Typically I would never order a dessert that had any sort of licorice/anise flavor but it seemed like every other dish that went past our table was this dessert so I figured I had to try it. It was very good,moist and chocolaty, just the way I like it! 

The service was very good, from the hostess to the server, I really felt as though they were striving to please the guest. I noticed the manager spending most of her time going from table to table helping the servers and making sure everyone at the table was happy with everything. In my opinion, this is one of the single best practices a restaurant can employ to make sure food and service standards are kept high. 

Can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Food and service excellent. We have enough food left to feed us for a week. Well worth the drive all the way over here. I feel the need for a nap but it's too late. Thank you Maggianos for a great anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible. Absolutely horrible service. Nice place but subpar food and horrendous service."}
{"text":"First time visit and really enjoyed it.  Great ambiance.  Excellent service and food and reasonable prices.  Steven, our server, was outstanding and made us feel special.  Very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"This is a review for the service.

I was there with a large party this past weekend. One of the members had specific eating needs, and a reservation was made well ahead of time so that the party could be split into 3 tables of 8 each in order to not do the family style eating. Again, the restaurant had agreed to this specific arrangement a number of months ahead of time.

Once we arrived, the restaurant did not honor this original agreement. We were told that it would have to be family style eating. A number of us had no desire to eat that much food, and were unhappy about being charged a mandatory price for food we weren't going to eat anyway. ESPECIALLY as the restaurant had agreed to allow us to order individually.  

They kept reiterating that is was for our \"benefit\" as we would get food at different times unless it was family style. We kept repeating that this was not an issue for us--we just wanted to be able to order individually. So we sat there for an hour, as one person after another discussed it with the servers.  One of our group finally was \"allowed\" to speak with someone in authority, at which point they relented and allowed us to order individually. An hour. It took an hour before they would agree to follow through with the original promise.

Overall, it was a lousy customer service experience. The restaurant tried to back down on their agreement, and then tried to out wait us. Just terrible."}
{"text":"The restaurant has nice design, but it's too overpriced. The food is not worse the price. Service was good, but our waiter did not follow up his suggestion. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm in the minority but I find this place mediocre. Their prices seem a bit high, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"We took a Sunday afternoon to specifically drive to Charlotte to go to this restaurant since all of their stores in our area have closed down.  Maybe that should have been a harbinger of what we would experience at this location, especially after we learned that a sister location in Charlotte, Romano's, had closed about two month's earlier.  We also had a gift card from Christmas that we wanted to use and we enjoy going to the shops in the South Park area of Charlotte on occasion.  The start of the experience had some high points, but that just left us at a higher level for a steeper fall as the meal progressed.  We got to the restaurant about 2:45 pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was about half full so we were seated immediately.  

But then the waiting games began.  Part of the issue was the change of shifts, but they do this every day so it should not be an issue.  We had three different people introduce themselves as our servers and the first took the drink orders.  The second person brought the drinks, after about a 10 minute wait.  The third one ended up taking our meal order and giving us the bill.  In between there were several other people who delivered the parts of our meal.  And it is obvious that they either don't have a process for indicating which patron ordered what, or they were never trained on it if it exists, or they ignored it because every time something was delivered they either asked who ordered what or started to set it down and we had to direct them where it went.  Once a server even was ready to serve the food meant for the table beside us, who did happen to be seated after us, but realized he had three entrees and we were only two people.  Of course since I am big enough to be two people maybe he thought I ordered two meals. 

They did bring out the bread and mixed up some Balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping and I must say it was excellent.  But we could have used more bread to enjoy more of it in the plate, but no one came by to ask if we might want some more bread. We ordered the meal for two which allows you to chose selections from each course. Mary ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana which came over a bed of Spaghetti.  I had the basic Spaghetti and Meatballs.   I also ordered 2 pieces of the Bruschetta w/tomatoes, garlic and cheese as an appetizer.  The first service flaw was when a server brought both the appetizers and the salad at same time on the same tray, so it wasn't accidental.  This was just the start.  

The salads were there so we started on them, not being sure how quickly the entrée would be there, and both Mary and commented on how good the salad dressing was, she had the Maggiano Salad w/o blue cheese and I had the Spiniach Salad, w/o onions.  We didn't need to hurry on the salads though because it was 45 minutes before our entrees arrived.  The food was excellent and they also give you an entree to go!  But while I like a break between courses, 45 minutes is more than a break.  And again, no one came around to ask if there was anything we needed, like refilling our drinks
.  
However, as good as the food was the service was that far on the opposite side of the scale.  Our server Kathy, only came to the table once to ask if we needed anything before we were finished eating.  Before I could respond, since I had just take a bite of food, she was gone.  And at that point my glass with water was 1/2 empty as was my glass of tea and she didn't recognize that they should be replenished.  And there were plenty of other servers re-filling drinks at the tables around us that never bothered to refill our drinks or even ask.  After we were finished with dinner there was another wait for the desserts, even though we had told her when we placed our order what we would be having.  When Kathy brought the bill she did ask if I wanted my drink refilled and I said no, just process my payment so I can leave.  There must have been signs around us or something because even the managers avoided coming to our table, yet they stopped at tables all around us to check if there was anything they needed and ask how their experience was.  As I said, several tables that were seated after us left before we did.  Now I will recognize that we did have more courses than they did but it should not have taken an hour longer.

If this is indicative of the service that the other locations are giving I can understand why they are closing.  Needless to say, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone again.  But it has given me several stories about how not to provide customer service that I can use in my operations management classes."}
{"text":"So, in a city with splendid non-chain food Italian, I still ended up at Maggiano's.  The flavours aren't delicate, nor are the dishes exquisitely creative... but it's a convenient location, and it's consistent across cities.

A Calamari, Linguini Carbonara, Chocolate cake and a Stella Artois later, there were two very sated people walking out with a fairly full doggy bag.  Midnight snack and satiation -- not a bad combo.

High dining it may not be, but a stable staple it is indeed."}
{"text":"I chose Maggiano's South Summerlin for a family style dinner in celebration of my birthday 3/7! I asked my sister Debbey to help me with reservations and we planned the menu from a wonderful assortment of deliciousness. We had a gathering of 13 total here. Oh we were treated right from the moment we entered the door! Friendly, courteous, excellent customer service received by each guest. I had a birthday card handsigned by the staff at Maggiano's! Our servers were the best we all have encountered anywhere, seriously amazing. Our menu consisted of a complimentary bruschetta sampler (quite a surprise)  the chopped salad (omg so delicious) the Perfectly prepared zucchini Spears which were approximately 6-9 inch. length with a delicious crisp breading, no grease at all! Then the main dishes: Mom's Lasagna, Salmon with lemon and spinch bed (YUM) FOUR CHEESE RAVIOLI (+10**) Chicken Parmesan, followed by Tiramisu xoxo and Spumoni xo. Absolutely DELICIOUS. I ordered the house specialty  wine and I have to call back to find out the name...Oak something Cabernet also so very good. I was so pleased that I chose to celebrate my birthday with family here. Each of us had good things to say. Maggiano's Little Italy you made our day  you now have 13 marketing promoters loose in our home town Las Vegas! We might keep it to ourselves but I don't see how that is possible! Everyone was happy and enjoyed the entire evening. Thank you for making us feel at home and for the personal touch with each guest! My 63rd birthday just made the top of my chart! Love the service and the Wonderful experience and the PERFECTION of each dish. God bless each of you! The packages of food to take home? Ten stars *"}
{"text":"Always have been a big fan of Maggiano's, great food and service, went back 3/6/2016, portions for some reason seemed smaller than usual, service was slow, but place was very busy and server tried her very best to do a good job, but seem overwhelmed by how crowded the restaurant was, maybe she had too many tables to serve. One person in our party needed gluten free and they were very good about it, that there was no cross contamination. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Went to this spot with the wife and our friend on Sunday afternoon for lunch. 

I went with the spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. I ordered a side Italian sausage. Talk about HEARTY! I have quite the appetite and I stayed full for 12 hours. It was a delicious dish if you're looking for good spaghetti. 

Although I love a lot of different foods, I don't eat any cheese at all. So that limits my choices at Italian restaurants. Regardless, I was very happy with what I had. 

They were very accommodating of my wife who required gluten free. They even sent the chef out to speak with her about any other allergies she may have to make sure they got it correct. Kudos to them for that!

The server was great, the food runner was very nice (came out on a separate occasion from the chef to advise that the meatball is prepared with flour so the wife should refrain from eating it) , and the chef as I previously mentioned. 

Great location, great atmosphere, delicious food."}
{"text":"You must visit Maggiano's. We were in Las Vegas and decided to make a reservation on Open Table. We were certainly not disappointed. As in a previous review we requested a corner table by the window. It was perfect. Our waiter Matin could not have been more pleasant and made my special birthday celebration one of the best. My husband ordered the Caesar Salad and Lasagna. He didn't want to tell me that their lasagna was better than mine. I had the Maggiano Salad and Chicken Piccata. It was fabulous. Their meals are delicious and the prices are reasonable. If you have not tried this restaurant do yourself a favor and do so. You will not be disappointed. One glass of Chardonnay, two salads and two entrees for $55.00 + tip. Very, very reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. We had a large dinner party celebrating a birthday. Great service. All our food was excellent!! Couldn't ask for a better time. I had the seafood pasta which was amazing and large size. The pear appetizer I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"I think I may be addicted to their special for two where you get two pastas, two side salads and share a desert plus two pastas to take home. Their pastas were huge servings and delicious and their apple fritter with ice cream desert is my favorite.
Just a note about our server Charles he made the whole evening a pleasure. When my wife wanted a cherry for her old fashion it was brought to the table instantly. The service was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific, but high calorie. It is very busy pretty much all the time, so make reservations. Our server was inexperienced (forgot to bring my drink), but made up for it with a pleasant attitude. I would recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We made a last minute dinner reservation on a Wednesday night and managed to find a table. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. 

I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was really good, though a little too sweet for my liking so I added crushed red pepper to enhance the taste a a bit. Between three of us, we ordered a white wine sangria -- and it was horrible! It barely had any wine in it, we could only taste Sprite! And the pitcher was quite small for the value. However, the food was great, warm and quick! Our server was great and kept checking on us every now and then."}
{"text":"Always a great time from start to finish. This place sets a precedence of customer service and experience. It's always been a place for my family gatherings, tonight I got to go with my boyfriend. We were greeted kindly and immediately. Our service tonight was \"wow\" no other way to put it. Our server Silvia was just amazing. She provided service with a smile, great recommendations and just made us feel welcome and couldn't help but smile and laugh with her. The food was amazing, tried a few new things and stuck with with old-goodies because of childhood memories. We had another amazing date night and very much contributed by Silvia. We left stuffed to the gills and with big smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"I visit Las Vegas three times or more per year, and ever time we have to stop and eat at Maggiano's. It reminds me of some of the old Italian Restaurants back East. It's Italian comfort food and the service is excellent. Last year my wife and I celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we booked our dinner at Maggiano's. The waiter was not only attentive, but engaging. He interacted so well with everybody from my 90year old mother to my 4 year old grandchildren. The food was great."}
{"text":"Just wanted to follow up on my recent review for a take out order. Maggiano's did refund my order and provided some additional gift certificates for future use. As I mentioned before, the food is always good and the value is always there. I will definitely revisit this restaurant again despite the problem I had with take out. I'm hoping the issues I had will be resolved next time around."}
{"text":"This place is great for groups.  You can order a few of their LARGE plates and share.  We had a group of 5, ordered 2 large pastas, calamari and garlic bread.  After everyone was stuffed, we still had enough to feed another 5 people.

Comparably, the large plates are just a few bucks more than the small plates.. and average cost is about $15 per large order.  

We had the linguine and clams in white sauce and the pesto chicken.  Both were very tasty!  I love pesto, so of course I went for the pesto first!  

The setting is nice, dimmed and quiet.  This place is definitely the place to go to grab some dinner and head out to party afterwards.  It right on the strip by Wynn and Encore."}
{"text":"great wedding 7 course dinner for mr grand daughter in vegas. Vegas traffic is bad, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food, easy access since it's in the Fashion Show Mall. I was introduced to this restaurant in Chicago and ever since we love to celebrate special occasions there."}
{"text":"This maggiano's is pretty pleasant, perhaps an alternative restaurant if you just spent too long at fashion show and cannot dare cross the street (the obstacle of crossing the street from point a to point b has left me 20 minutes late PLENTY of times, even if it's just from saks to the wynn!). Also a good restaurant for bigger portions--their plates can be a foot long for a single person. Big portions! A homey feeling, which is very common for them."}
{"text":"Great dinner & great prices for Southern Italian food.  Excellent service from our server."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here.  Let me tell you, after shopping the hotels for receptions we knew this was the place for us.  We spoke with Marc, the event person and he showed us their private rooms.  Since we had about 90 people attending, it was very affordable.  The menu we choose was a family style 3-course meal with appetizers.  Since we had some older people attending the family style service was great.  It was all you can eat, but they served everything at the tables so no buffet type of lines.  Everything was done through email and a few phone calls and it was done.  Cassie, the second in charge for catering was extremely helpful.

Shop around, but the food is second to none and the service staff during the reception were very professional and friendly.  If you have any type of event in Vegas, check this place out.  You can't beat the prices and the food is awesome!!"}
{"text":"excellent Italian dining in Vegas. They have some great pasta and chicken dishes and a decent selection of wines, but an ok selection of desserts. We went here about 3 years ago and wanted a nice dinner after watching \"KA\" and it was a nice walk to get there and we only waited about 20 mins. We got seats near the window with a wonderful view of the Vegas strip. If you're gonna compare chain Italian restaurants, \"Maggiano's\" little Italy is much better than \"Olive Garden\". I recommend going here to finish off a nice romantic night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here late one night and my boyfriend and I shared dinner in the bar area. We ordered the lasagna and it was just enough for 2. In all honesty, I think he would have like to eat more, but I was hungry too so he couldn't have it all to himself. It was delicious. 

We were looking at the pictures they have hanging in the bar area and noticed that two older ladies that were sitting in the bar area having drinks and dressed to the nines, were also pictured on the wall. This must be the spot for local celebrities!  :p  

I'll definitely have to come back here and try something else from their menu."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Went there the first time, and it was definitely not our last! Great food and great service. We were told to wait 25 mins for the table but they texted us after 10 mins to let us know the table was ready. We were lucky to get a table with the view of the palazzo and wynn. The food was delicious, definitely the best pasta I've had on the Strip. Our server was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I dined here with my family last Thursday and could not have been happier. The food was outstanding and the service was great as well. The atmosphere is hard to beat, especially if you are a sucker for natural lighting like myself. The BEST eggplant parm I have ever had. The Peach Bellini was great after a hot day walking the strip. All things considered I would choose this Maggiano's over a lot of the fine dining Italian restaurants near by. (Sinatra's, B&B ristorante, Allegro) I would choose Maggianos ."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for our server Christopher.  I can't say enough about his attention to detail ensuring the food was delicious, hot and on-time.  We had ordered the Family-Style Dinner.  We enjoyed every course. The complimentary Chef's Antipasto (which is included with the Family Dinner) was fresh and definitely recommended.

Traveling with a (2) year old you have a short window of time before a relaxing dinner goes south quickly.  We dined the night before Thanksgiving, the restaurant was packed at 7pm and was seated for a party of (5) in (15) mins.  

Please make sure to request for this professional gentleman.  He'll make sure you walk out of this restaurant satisfied."}
{"text":"So you would think this place has it down when it comes to large parties because the only time I have ever come here (and have seen many times) is for large get togethers.  Well, they came sort of close...

I have worked in a restaurant as a server, so I always try to give the server the benefit of the doubt.  I know that it is extremely stressful serving large parties, takes much longer, and can generally stress you out.  Our server appeared to be finishing up with a very large party of about 20 women when he started with us.  Ok, I'll give him that.. it took quite some time between the time we sat to the time we ordered drinks, got our drinks, and then placed our food order (about 20 minutes).  It took another 30 minutes before our table got our salads/soups... and then ANOTHER 30-40 minutres after soups/salads were served until we got our food.  By the time we got our food, we were tired, not that hungry, and a little irritated.  Plus, I don't think the food is worth THAT long of wait.

To rate the food/drinks:
-Mom said her martini was just OK... should have been served more chilled.
-salads were heavy on the dressing, but good.
-Main dishes were good, good quality food... but side of angel hair pasta dishes were too dry.

Our server did apologize stating that there were many other problems tonight in the kitchen, hence the long wait.. but who knows if that is true (I may or may not have used that line a time or two as a server...) And he did redeem for the long wait by providing us 2 free desserts to take home (cheesecake was yum!)

I guess my biggest complaint, while also trying to be understanding of the fact that this place is so insanely busy, was the general attitude I felt from the staff we interacted with.  From the hostess to the manager helping the hostess to the server... I felt as a server, they were not emitting the kind of welcoming attitude that should be given at a restaurant.  Yes, I know it is jam-packed in your restaurant and people are probably complaining up the wahzoo about waiting for a table.  But the experience the staff creates for a restaurant is usually what gets me wanting to come back!

Another tip--be prepared to talk loudly when you go.. it is very noisy!  And dark."}
{"text":"Alright... here we go!

First and foremost the food was great!  Well done with the pasta!  

The service was half and half. What I mean by that is some of the employees are very professional and the other half are subpar.  I believe in being good with your craft and some are not. 

I say at the bar which I usually do and when I walked up it was not cleaned from the last party that was there. It didn't take long for the bartender to clear it from the last bartender that was on shift. 

I also witnessed some of the waiters/servers clowning around in the entry area. Kind of annoying... also had another server pacing behind me waiting to clear her check or something. She was loud and annoying in a place that is generally quiet. 

Besides all this I enjoyed myself and blame it on this one occasion. Most of the time Maggiano's is legit. I feel this was a one off, just ok, experience."}
{"text":"Had 6p reservations.  Arrived a few minutes early and seated immediately. Was disappointed that valet was $7...a little steep considering parking is free.  We had the meal for two. Started with bruschetta flight. This was probably my favorite part of the meal-wife also like all the varieties. I liked candied bacon one best and she likes the shrimp one best but all were great.  Entrees were Vegetable Primavera and mushroom ravioli. Both good, hearty dishes but nothing for me to write home about. For dessert my wife had tiramisu and I ordered some of the lemon cookies.  Both great! Service good but not great. Unsweetened tea was weak. Overall, a really pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Blueberries Maple Syrup and A grilles Italian Sausage.  Light and fluffy pancakes with a hint of Lemon.  Add the maple syrup and blueberries......  a flavor that is sweet, tart, and smooth from the top of your tongue to you stomach.  The Italian sausages have a very mild spice but melts with the other flavors in such a way you just want more even after your full."}
{"text":"So I came here with a bunch of friends as our first group meal for a bachelor party weekend on a Friday night. We were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop. We received a number of pre-ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so I am not sure what the breakdown was, but it was AYCE and we definitely enjoyed the grub.

We had about 30 guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons. We had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once...

Pro Tip: Call ahead and get a reservation. A number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt.

The food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me. It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.  

The one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.

Overall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group. It is hard to say for sure."}
{"text":"A good friend took me over , he praised this place for so long, I was expecting, I guess a bit too much.
Saturday late morning, the restaurant wasn't Yet even half full.

A confused waiter, messed our drinks order maybe 3 times. And all we wanted was coffee and tea. (Where the hell did places in this town got the habit of getting your coffee without a spoon, and when you dare ask them for one you get the feeling from them As if you are insane)

An appetizer , stuffed mushrooms with spinach was mediocre at best, in some kind of white wine sauce (I guess?) .
Pasta la chef with seafood & Alfredo , again , mediocre. Ate maybe half, took the rest home and dumped it righ when I got home.

I did like the decor."}
{"text":"Always amazing and this location is truly the best I've been to. Consistently perfect and ultra friendly staff. Very accommodating. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Had the sausage and flat bread and was very happy with the service.  Would come again for sure and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Looking through the other reviews it should be obvious this place is not doing so well. I've had plenty of fantastic experiences at the strip location so to alleviate the rigatoni D craving just go there! Our night started with the robotic \"have you dined with us before.\" I get it, they have to ask. Anyway, I didn't like my wine, and the server took some time to condescend me about my opinion before offering to exchange it. I didn't want that to deter from our dinner but then the server was constantly nowhere to be found. I'd hear him nearby and then he'd shoot elsewhere; not very attentive but I understand it was pretty busy that night. Fast forward to the end of the night we come home to two random leftovers from another table!!! Can't even explain how disgusted I was to find this. Not to mention everything the server did that wasn't to our expectation he had an excuse for like forgetting something or giving us the wrong order. I gave this 2 stars just because I love rigatoni D that much."}
{"text":"Rigatoni D never disappoints! As well as the flat breads,  can't beat the happy hour!"}
{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving dinner.   The food was delicious and our waiter, Eric, was terrific.   However, we were a party of 6 and made reservations two weeks in advance, I do not understand why we were given one of the worst tables in the restaurant.  We were put in the corner table by the elevator.  There was a constant stream of servers, patrons, busboys and trash collectors going up the elevator.  Not to mention the rescue workers that took a woman out on a stretcher.  My son and his girlfriend had to move for that.   Because we were in the corner we were forgotten about by some of the support staff.  Our salads came out before the appetizer.   It took forever to get our teas refilled, and we had to ask for utensils and plates several times. It was a good experience but not great.  I noticed that there were tables for 6 in the extra room where the patrons were not crammed together like sardines and not constantly interrupted by the goings on of the elevator."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Las Vegas my sister said this place was good so we went to eat here for lunch and happy hour. I was impressed. The $4 margherita flat bread from the happy hour menu was more than a foot long and so delicious! The house bread was warm and soft. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so good. The eggplant was juicy and not dry and the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not too thick which I like. The staff was nice and friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!"}
{"text":"To give you a little bit of a background, we order from Maggiano's catering department quite often. We had our annual year end party there a few years back. The food is generally excellent and I cannot find any fault with the back of the house. But let me tell you over the past three years I have observed the front of the house in a deplorable state. How can one restaurant deliver  a consistently bad customer experience over 5 or more visits? The entire front of the house from the manager down to the wait staff need to be retrained. 

Today was the last straw. I came to pick up a phone order and there were already one party waiting to be seated. Another lady was waiting for her to go order as well. So in all 3 parties all day. I approached the Maître D and informed him that I had an order to pick up. He checked with the kitchen to see if the order was fired. Mind you it was a simple order of chocolate zucotto balls that needed little to no prep at all. At this stage the Maitre D was on the phone to make a reservation. I observed 2 managers on the floor at this time as well as numerous wait staff doing their pre-shift  side work. The bartender returns with a cash register and engages in a lengthy conversation with the previous guest who was waiting for her to go order. One of the managers brought out the zucotto balls and placed them on the bar area. I continue to wait. At this point I was only acknowledged by the Maitre D who was still engaged on the phone. The bartender leaves and returns with the other lady's order. I then approach him to ask if that is indeed my order and if it was ready. He starts apologizing profusely albeit halfheartedly.

Having worked in fine dining myself before, I hold myself and other servers to a higher standard. This gentleman and his management and coworkers had zero awareness to meet the customer's needs and I will make it my personal crusade to never have myself or my family or friends patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"We were struggling with trying to have a good reasonably priced dinner for 22 in las Vegas. Everyplace we called wanted us to rent a private room, order from a pricey  catering menu and guarantee a minimum. Believe it or not, the totals were coming up to almost  FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS  including liquor,  tip tax and service charges.  We decided to have the dinner in our suite at Caesars and have maggiano's deliver. Best decision ever. Ashley guided us through the process and we had tons of great food at a fraction of the cost. They delivered on time, set everything up and left. We even had leftovers for lunch the next day. The food was actually better than I thought it would be. Bread, desert,  salad, entrees, everything was great. Would use this place again.  Total tab was under $500. We spent another hundred at the liquor store setting up our bar. Even if you add the cost of our 2 bedroom suite, we're still ahead. First time I won in Vegas.   Great night."}
{"text":"Great Scratch Style Italian food. Big portions and excellent customer service. We ate outside to enjoy the wonderful weather. It was amazing.. Next time I'll try eating in because the place like amazing. If your looking for good homemade \"scratch\" style Italian food this is your place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Loved that yelp helped us get a reservation at the time we wanted, walked right in and they were ready for us.  I had the Chicken Caprese, a special of the day, and it was amazing!! 

I second the hit-and-miss service--we had to ask for more water, and for our check.  They were busy, but found that annoying.  The mints are yummy--take a few! : )

Despite service issues, I would definitely return and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maggiano's several times in CA, but this was my first time in LV.

The food was good as always. The fettucini alfredo was the best I've ever had. My sister's chicken parmigiana was pretty tasty too. Again, definitely should share your plates!

What I loved most about this location was that it's right on the strip, and if you get a table by the window, you get a spectacular view of the Wynn across the street and all the bright lights of the strip. Perfect location for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Boy, do I love Maggiano's. 

My friends and I came here on a whim while in Vegas after working up appetites shopping at the mall. Probably not the best idea since we were squeezing into tight skirts/dresses later that evening.

The wait was about 20 minutes. Once seated, we ordered one of the family style dinners, which included soup, salad, a few entrees, and dessert--way more food than we expected.

Everything was amazing, including the service. Somehow after all that food, we all still had room for dessert. We definitely ate way too much, but hey, we were in Vegas after all."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on open table and parking was really close and easy. We were seated right away and were blown away by the family style option. Two appetizers, two, salads, two pastas, two entrees and two desserts..all of it is unlimited refills. really awesome food, good wine, nice atmosphere, exceptional service. I will dream about this meal."}
{"text":"Tuscan soup review: Jan. 6 2017, my full size serving was too salty( table salt?- which is gross) & flatulent producing. Of all the meals I have enjoyed here, this is the saddest. Service was attentive, friendly although I felt our server was dissappointed I didn't order a full entree. Tone establishes intent."}
{"text":"The Skinny: for Italian, food is okay but are skimpy on portion sizes for the price (3) service: prompt and efficient (4) baby friendly: They do have a changing station in the family bathroom and their booth can accommodate an infant car seat. Strollers are parked away from the tables. Value: for the level of cuisine, it is definitely overpriced (3).

If I were to sum up what the feeling was after leaving Maggiano's, it would be an overpriced, upscale Olive Garden. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely better as is the service. But the prices seemed exorbitant for what it was. 

We ordered a plate of fried zucchini, a lunch special (half chicken parmesan sandwich and half Caesar salad), and a plate of gnocchi.

The fried zucchini was a bit greasy and the coating was too heavy. The ranch dressing was relatively bland and lacked acidity. For $12 it was a smaller portion than I expected.

The lunch special with a half portion of a soup, salad or sandwich for $10.50. I got the chicken parm sammy with a half Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was pretty generic and generally uninteresting (there was no garlicky, lemony, anchovy punch at all). The chicken parmesan sandwich was very skimpy on the chicken parm and could have used more marinara.

The gnocchi fared better. The gnocchi was soft and not overly gummy. However the sauce it was paired with was overly salty and needed more acidity to lighten the dish.

Service was good and prompt. Our water glasses remained filled and our food/check came quickly. 

For families, they do have a changing station in the family bathroom which is hovering over the toilet. There is no private area to breastfeed. Strollers are parked around the hostess station while an infant car seat can fit in one of the booths.

Overall, the joint is okay in my books. The level of cuisine certainly does not merit the lofty prices they charge. But then again, this restaurant is on the Strip. 3 starred review."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place so I went with a friend, it was jam packed there and it took us a bit to get a table but it was well worth the wait. I got the lobster carbonara which I could not get through granted I had a salad and bread, you get a good portion size which is nice. I recommend making a reservation before going here for dinner, there is a reason it is packed, its on the strip and the food and atmosphere are great. Nice place."}
{"text":"We wanted a Non-casino Restaurant Lunch and since we were across from The Wynn, it was convenient.  When ordering my husband asked if the portions were big (he's got a big appetite) and the waiter said not really. However, the portion is huge!! So, be prepared to eat if you order one of their pasta dishes.  My lunch wasn't so great. I orderd the Crab Cake Sandwich which was salty and soggy. The chips that accompanied were stale and overly salty. I had desperatly wished I had stuck to what they know. . .pasta.  The service was slow and to top it off, I ordered a side salad with my sandwich for an extra $2.25 but they charged us for a normal side salad with out an entree. . .$4.50. Now, Its only $2 and I don't want the hassel of getting it  back, but what if everyone was getting charged incorrectly by the same waiter? No Bueno!  So, I said something and the Manager said he'd take care of it. We waited over 20 minutes for $2 and I was regretting my decision as I munched on the mints in the Host area.  When the Manager re-appeared, he comped our lunch because he made us wait so long!  So, I have to say, I will definately visit the one in Santana Row in San Jose, CA just for that. At least I know to stick to the pasta!"}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience I've ever had. Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer and came to Charlotte for my college graduation. I put in a reservation and asked for a nice waitress so my parents could have a pleasant meal. The restaurant and the staff went above and beyond. The sous chef and the manager came out with a platter full of all the desserts they make at the restaurant and they personally thanked us for being there. The back of their business cards say it's their goal to make people feel special and that's certainly what they did. What an amazing restaurant that actually cares about their guests. I will be returning every time I'm in Charlotte !"}
{"text":"Service was good- food was slow to come out and then came all at once 

About the same quality as other Italian restaurants in the casinos- nothing like the real thing in Italy or even North End in Boston"}
{"text":"I got the pasta carbonara and WOW!!! Amazing amazing amazing! It was delicious and the egg was new to me but wow this was so yummy and satisfied my cravings for Italian good!"}
{"text":"YUM!

First of all, this place is really big, and the interior has a good blend of homey yet classy and kind of made me feel like a snobby foodie. :) The restaurant has window panes across two sides and allows for a nice view of Las Vegas blvd (but not like a straight down the strip kind of view). Our server was very gracious, and the bread was amazing!

I ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which absolutely blew my mind. The chicken was stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes and coated with bread crumbs. The flavors and textures were all perfect!

The best part was that the lunch price was not too price at all! Most of the pasta items were in the low-teens and the portions were enormous! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Vegas :)"}
{"text":"The food was sooooo good!  Everything was fresh and delicious and the service was great. We left very happy!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's was a pleasant surprise. 

Can we just remove an Olive Garden and insert a Maggiano's in my neck of the woods? Although, this spot is in a mall, I really wouldn't have pegged Maggiano's as a chain restaurant. The restaurant is spacious and comforting.

The food was pretty good as well. I went with the veal piccata and tried some baked ziti and four cheese ravioli. The veal was not as tender as I would of liked it to be but it was still nicely prepared and the sauce was right on. The pastas were tasty, especially the ravioli. A bottle of wine completed our meal.

After lunch, my buddies and I went to the bar for some blue label whiskey, which I've tried one other time before I really had a decent palette for whiskey. All, I have to say is wow!! It was so much better the second time around.

The bill for the whiskey was another wow!! Our bartender sheepishly placed our bill on the table. 42 bucks a piece... Damn, I was thinking maybe $20... The bartender was nice enough to pore us the rest of the bottle though! Vegas baby!

I did feel bad for my buddy who was not a whiskey drinker at all. He ended up asking for a coke, which he ended up mixing the whiskey with. Oh wow..."}
{"text":"i'm being generous here!
i'm reading all these reviews and i'm laughing hysterically.
have people never had good italian before?
maggiano's, a brinker international restaurant, the same owners as chili's, macaroni grill and on the border.
right there, that should signal what crappy food you'll get.
that is unless you're the type that likes chili's.
gross!
anyway, my friend and i went to maggiano's for lunch one rainy afternoon because we had a gift card.
thank god because i would've killed myself had i actually spent the full amount of the check there.
i ordered the shrimp scampi which was completely overpriced.
the 20 strands of pasta that i received were overcooked, not al dente.
the 3 shrimp on my dish were plump and cooked correctly although completely drowning in oil and butter.
i could literally feel my arteries clogging up.
my friend ordered the lobster ravioli.
i believe her dish consisted of 5 pieces.
again, the pasta was way overcooked.
the lobster filling had more celery and relish and other things that were not lobster.
the sauce was decent.
the service was mediocre.
our server was very loud, polite but still extremely loud, unneccessarily loud.
for the amount of money that we still ended up spending less the gift card, i feel that the food and the service were not equitable.
there are far better italian restaurants within the same price range that serve far better food with far better service.
i will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants, but Maggiano's is an exception. I brought my kids here for a birthday dinner. We did not have reservations but thankfully they were able to seat us immediately. This location is in the Fashion Show Mall and has great views for people watching. 

Our server James was top notch. He took excellent care of us an made sure our glasses were constantly full. The food was excellent, which I expected. We had plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day ;)"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars only because the place is cute and the apps were yummy. Our server was sweet but so busy that we barley got looked at the whole time, except when we had to complain about the food, then we sure did get looked at. My husband never complains mind you but this food was so bad that even he couldn't keep his mouth shut. The side of dried pasta with no sauce that comes with the meal is pointless and gross, I would of rather eaten Top Ramon. The Chicken Marcela  was so dry it was not even edible, and I'm pregnant I'd eat almost anything! The sauce on it was bland and lacked any flavor, other then bad gravy. Honestly I know good Italian food and this is not it... I would rather go to Olive Garden, yes I just said that."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday dinner last night and wanted to thank our server Jess K. for a great evening. Our table was a group of 8-11 friends and family members all meeting up for a birthday dinner.... meaning many people of all ages showing up sporadically, and being very chatty while our server patiently attended to us and her other tables. I should also mention that we were on the second floor... so every drink and every meal had to also be loaded on a tray and carried upstairs. At one point during the evening, I ordered a glass of wine. Unfortunately, those drink trays are not always the easiest conveyance and our poor server wore that glass of wine. We were notified there was a delay in delivering my drink because of an accident, but told it would be right up. And it was... all OVER our poor server. She looked absolutely tye-dyed. But wow, what a trooper! She continued to smile the entire time, laughing it off and working very hard to make our night special for US. Thank you Jess! Everyone loved you, your service, and your attitude. While accidents happen to everyone, you made the best of it for everyone."}
{"text":"First off, the service was absolutely very good. However, it seemed extraordinarily rushed. That's not necessarily a negative. It's just nice to go into an environment where the servers aren't waiting behind the curtains to snatch the empty plate and ask for if you want anything else continuously. Overall the service was very good and our server was very attentive. The decor is very rat pack oriented. So if you don't like Frankie or Sammy this is not the place for you :-).
The happy hour advertised that goes until 7 PM, it's actually 6 PM. The foods a little on the pricey side but you pay for the quality. They have all things Italian. A very decent wine list, and of course the desserts were amazing. If you going to make reservations, which they do take, make sure you get a booth. The place fills up very quickly and gets a little noisy fast.
 The regular seating is very spacious. However, they do have a very elegant bar area that's fully stocked with very polite staff. There is also an outside porch that features tea lights tables and heaters if necessary.
 I would highly recommend this place for anyone who loves Italian food we will definitely be visiting this venue again!"}
{"text":"We were blown away!!!! I mentioned I had a food allergy, the chef himself, Peter, came out and assisted me through my menu options and even went as far as personally customizing my meal! We can't thank him enough, and will highly recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"Last week my boyfriend and I went to try out this location. We had an amazing dinner. We called and made reservations and were seated within 10 minutes of getting there. And we actually showed up about 25 minutes prior to our reservation time. The food was delicious. Our server was really sweet and she made the experience pleasant. She did forget to offer us balsamic vinaigrette for our olive oil and bread(which I didn't find out thy offers till our brunch yesterday morning lol ) overall it was amazing though. We ordered crispy pepperoni risotto balls that were the best appetizer we have ever had! I ordered the filet with garlic mashed potatoes and cheesecake for dessert! Was amazing and fresh ! We loved it so much we went back this Saturday to try there brunch. I was not disappointed at all! Coffee and a complimentary pastry for joining for brunch. We order the chicken egg Benedict and the \"meatball\" which were amazing and full of flavor. The crispy Vesuvio potatoes were awesome! Also we shared the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were the best darn things I have ever had! We will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Food was amazing even nice and hot! Also service was really well  everyone seemed interested in serving you!"}
{"text":"I like this place, the service is excellent. They have a full bar, the flat bread is good start, also the calamari. The lobster carbonara is great i also the seafood pasta is good. I tasted the salmon as well. i think i will order that next time. one thing you should do is call ahead for reservations. This will save you some headaches waiting. Also allow a extra 15 minutes get through the strip traffic and parking."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, it's certainly easy to forget about this place with so many great eateries in and around Charlotte but I attended a wedding reception recently that reminded me of those great stuffed mushrooms and salmon dishes that they serve.  I'm not sure if they've always had the reception area on the 3rd floor or maybe I never noticed it, but it's the perfect room for a special event........very impressive.  The only issue seemed to be the dj having to turn down the music if the management felt it was too loud.  I really enjoyed the food, so much so that I returned for for a birthday dinner........a bit pricey in my opinion but solid food."}
{"text":"Wonderful, romantic atmosphere. Our waiter, Nestor, was amazing and the fools delicious. I had the seafood linguine di mare - seriously one of the best pasta dishes I had ever had. My wife had the shrimp scampi and enjoyed it. We were too full for dessert but Nestor surprised us with some tasty dessert bites to go with 'happy anniversary' written in cholocate. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a good experience with this restaurant.. The service was slow, the tables are too close to each other, and most importantly the food was horrible. My steak was undercooked and the waitress took it back TWICE until it got the way I ordered it which was well-done!! We waited more than 30 mins to get a table and after that another hour and a half to get our food!! Never going back again
The only good side was that the fact that they removed my order from the total bill.."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4-stars because it's a chain. I did think the food was good. I wasn't big on the stuffed mushrooms because they lacked flavor. I liked my salad a lot though and the bread was great too. The staff was super kind. I came here for the Super Bowl game 2017. Unfortunately Atlanta lost but it was a good place to come for some quiet from the sports bars. They have a decent amount of TVs here while maintaining their classy \"old-man's study\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices, and great portions. Dined here for my birthday and our server Nathan provided what I considered to be the absolute best customer service experience that I've ever received in life. He not only made me feel special on my special day, but made family feel very special as well. The food was great... but honestly the service that we received from Nathan was amazing. I would highly recommend this restaurant and recommend requesting Nathan as your server! I'm hoping that management sees this review and gives Nathan the recognition he deserves for doing such an amazing job, exhibiting a true love and passion for his job, and for being AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Fascinating food and excellent service by Laura. Will come back with la familia next time. The lasagna was magnificent, too. And the salad with feta
Cheese was super delicious. You feel
Healthy even if you know it isn't soooo :))"}
{"text":"Went here and it is nice to be able to park and go up the elevator right into the restaurant.   Food was extremely good and the service was excellent.  The prices were very affordable as well.  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"We always have such amazing times here every time we come we always request for Nestor. 
His service at our table is phenomenal. 
We also got a lot of food yesterday. 
We got the four cheese ravioli which was super good. My boyfriends dad loves that dish and he gets it every time. 
Boyfriend got the braised beef pasta thing which was amazing. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the beef literally melts in your mouth. I didn't think that was possible when they say it on TV. 
Mom got some sort chicken ravioli or something like that, she really like it. 
I got the chicken Alfredo, was a little disappointing as always. It just didn't taste right lol 
Either way the service was so good thatss why I'm giving a five. I'm sure you don't need my recommendation to go there. Everything is great there."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok.  There seem to be a lack of flavor to the pastas (I tried both the lasagna and spaghetti w/ meatballs).  Was a little disappointed.  Portions were pretty sizable and that's why I gave it a 3.  But the place was crowded, line practically out the door, and felt warm and inviting.  I definitely had better, flavorful pasta at the Olive Garden!  Will look elsewhere for more tasty Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Had chicken sausage flatbread, chicken caprese salad and calamari for lunch. I think all 3 dishes were mediocre. But we did enjoy the nice interior deco, comfortable booth seating and pleasant service. We also learned that this Maggiano's is not owned by the Lettuce Entertain You in Chicago
area. Therefore LEY's frequent diner club won't work here."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent. We were sat and the waiter was very friendly. The bread was soft and delicious. I ordered the four cheese ravioli...and the flavor was a bit bland but I added some more seasoning to get it where I wanted. Not sure if I'll be back but if I need a Italian spot, I don't mind coming here."}
{"text":"Really nice place, beautiful view, decent price, waiters could be more friendly but overall i was pleased."}
{"text":"I ordered take out.  Four cheese ravioli with pesto Alfredo.  I drove home and to my dismay my pasta was covered in marinara. I called and the manager answered.  He was very kind and said he would start the correct order right away.  He explained the dish is garnished in marinara.  However I did not read that in the description and dislike tomato sauce.  As soon as I returned to the restaurant they replaced the pasta. I was frustrated I had to drive all the way back, but they gave really great service."}
{"text":"This place has an \"expensive feel\" with the nice decor and waiters with white towels draped over their arms, yet they have reasonable prices on all of their entrees. My favorite part of eating here is the attentive staff. Empty plates, refills, and anything extra needed was addressed very quickly without having to flag down or grab the arm of your waiter/waitress as they run by to get some ranch or more water."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying the start of our experience was pretty crappy for lack of a better word. We had a large group (17). We arrived but since we all drove seperately we clearly starting arriving at different times. Two of us arrived checked in and was told by the hostess we had to have more than half to be seated, fair enough. 5 minutes later I go back to the hostess and tell her 13 of us are there. She says ok it will just be a few minutes. 5 min later we check again and they say our table is being set up and water is being placed (which I don't see why water being placed would hinder us from sitting down but ok?!?!) so it will only be a min. 10 minutes later we go back again tell them our whole party is here and we are then told by a pretty snotty hostess that it will be a few minutes since we went from 17 to 14 people..I was so confused because we not once said we were down to 14 AND the reservation was made for 17 people, which is exactly what we had. Annoyed another person in the party went up to the hostess and a minute later we were being sat. No clue what he said to get us seated. Greeting and first impression 0 stars.

We were greeted by our servers as we were sitting down and they took our drink orders. Our servers were great, friendly and attentive. 5 stars!

Throughout the course of our meal we realized we were missing some plates. Mind you this meal was a preset meal ordered and planned online prior, of which we had confirmation. After asking our server about the missing dishes he said he was informed of something totally different. Irritated we just said never mind let's just get thru this dinner and leave. The manager came and spoke to our table and apologized for the error. She was sincere and after all was said and done everyone was content. The food was pretty good, comparable to other Italian restaurants. 3 stars.

Not sure I would go back but its location is nice, overseeing the Wynn and las vegas blvd at the fashion show mall. Location 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner recently. The food was excellent and we did the deal where you pick 2 meals and they pack 1 to go. This is great as we ate our to go items for the next 2 days because the servings are so large. The waiter we had was nice but the service was a bit slow. Overall, a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Maggiano's since before it came to Phoenix!  I grew up going to the locations in Chicago, and am happy to say that the food quality and service is spot on in Scottsdale too!  Here are a few tips to dining at Maggiano's that will enhance the experience: 

1. Make a reservation... they take them for all party sizes
2. Go with 4 or more people and dine family style! There are tons of menu options, the cost is reasonable, and its bottomless as long as the plate is clear! 
3. Wear expandable clothes, you will over eat!

Some of my favorite vegetarian dishes include the maggiano's salad(no prosciutto) , mushroom ravioli, Gnocchi in Vodka sauce, and cheese ravioli in a creamy pesto sauce. I know, none of this is healthy, but every once in a while you need to let loose and enjoy fantastic Italian food!"}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and delicious! The wait staff was friend, quick, and courteous.  The restaurant is kid friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on V-day for my mom's birthday. I made a reservation on Open Table and I'm glad I did because they were at an hour and a half wait when we arrived for our reservation at 12:15pm. 

For a chain, the food is pretty good. We had the special for the week which was a chicken stuffed tortellini with spinach, tomatos, smoked ham in a truffle butter white wine sauce that was so good! 

We also had the double fudge brownie for dessert which was so good. I loved the balsamic glaze they drizzled over the ice cream and strawberries that came with the brownie. 

And triple bonus, the special came with a take home classic pasta so I was able to get a dish to take home and eat later. And I was able to use my birthday rewards certificate for $10 off my bill!"}
{"text":"The stars have been dropped solely for he hostess in the front. She didn't even acknowledge us, I actually had to say hello, and ask for a table for three. She gave what I would have to say was a pretty dirty look like she could t be bothered. This was the most bizarre interaction I had with a hostess. I was about to turn around and suggest a different restaurant to our family but the second blonde hostess leading us to the table was much friendlier. The first hostess didn't have to smile but at least ask how many were in our party. My husband who usually doesn't even take note said, \"wow, she's rude!\"  Our waitress was very nice, as was the rest of the staff. But if that hostess is the first person you have to interact with then, no thanks, I'm not sure if we'll be back. The food was good but that lady really left a bad taste."}
{"text":"I always leave here wishing I could eat more. After the flatbread pizza and the fried mozzarella, I'm usually stuffed before they bring out the giant portion of chicken parm. I've never had dessert, as I'm already bringing home a ton of food. 

They seated us in the corner with all the windows. Great view of the Strip and plenty of people watching during the meal. Very efficient waiter."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars and Ill tell you why. I would give it 4stars for the interior. I like what they have going on, but it does make you expect something different. 
They also have a great menu selection at really good prices. 

I ordered a salad that had a viagrette I really liked, other than that the salad was pretty blah. I could have made that at my house.

The chicken parmagana taste like a frozen entree from costco. The ravioli has a horrible flavor, they bring you bread and olive oil, which is fine but the olive oil is soo cheap and gross. Super bitter.

The portions a huge but who cares if the food isnt good. Its like a frozen food festival in there. 

A waste of a cool building and a great menu. Just poorly executed food."}
{"text":"It's been around so long that I rarely go anymore.  However, when I do go, I'm reminded at how good it is.  Italian is a food I often do not dine out on since I'm fairly decent Italian cook myself.  But, I can't deny the delicious food, and value of eating a portion in the restaurant and getting a portion to take home.  Since each portion is good for at least 2 meals, that's 4 meals for the price of 1!"}
{"text":"Everything here is made from scratch in house and you can definitely taste it in the food. We had the spinach dip as an appetizer. It is a little different, I think more Alfredo sauce style base, but one of the best I have ever had. We also  had  house special braised beef lasagna and chicken piccata. Both amazing.  Our server was attentive, checked on us several times"}
{"text":"Tried both locations, gotta say this Summerlin restaurant is really nice (cos it's newer?) ...great atmosphere, menu and people! Nathan was very impressive with his knowledge, friendly demeanor and personality. Grace and I tried his suggestions and were very pleased with out meals! Grace had Chicken tortellini with spinach, ham and white wine. I had the Salmon Oscar, plated with spinach, lump crab, asparagus ....OMG on both dishes..just as Nathan presented to us. Great dinner..thanks Nathan!"}
{"text":"Lobster carbonara and hand twisted noodles ...all from a 'scratch kitchen'...this place is excellent! Happy hour is from 3-6pm ... great atmosphere and employees!"}
{"text":"I came to Maggiano's celebrate another yelper Terri R birthday with family and friends. It was my first visit so never had much came to expectations. Truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review. If there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome. Our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise A-OK review. She was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me. She had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl. Just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her. Great service.

Since it was decent size party we had nine. Terri was able to order family style meal. It reminded me Bucca di Beppo style. Starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad. Entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. Dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. By the time got to the dessert was stuffed. None of the dishes had WoW factor at ALL. Some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. Bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. The portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. The pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. It located in the Fashion Show Mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. 

Overall so many more italian restaurant in Vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better. On this night it celebration BeastMode Terri R. not about the food but supporting family. Happy Birthday Terri R.!!!!"}
{"text":"With having such strong reviews I was a little disappointed with this place. The food was alright, not super flavorful at all or worth the dime dropped. 

The waiter was excellent, however the hostesses were unfortunately very unfriendly and rude. They didn't even lead us to our table they just pointed us where to go, in turn we got lost because this restaurant is quite large and bustling with waiters and waitresses between the many many tables on the floor. 

After we got seated finally our experience was much more pleasant thanks to the waiter. I got the steak and ravioli special ($26) and was not impressed. The steak were little medallions about an inch thick and 3 inches in diameter but no flavor-- not even salt or pepper. The 3 raviolis were good but the stuffing was a little too salty for me (I am a little salt sensitive). 

One of my friends had the carbonara special which is supposed to come with a poached egg, instead it arrived at our table as almost completely raw. The yolk was bright yellow and you could still see the clear jelly-like sac. The waiter graciously offered to redo it and bring another fresh on the house and did agree that is in no way a poached egg saying he could even poach one better than that. 

My other friend got the piccata and said that california pizza kitchen piccata was better. 

It smells delicious in here which is what attracted us to this place, but maybe we ordered the wrong things. I probably won't give this place another shot though, as there are too many good established restaurants I am aware of already."}
{"text":"WOW. That sums it up. I'll start with, we booked Maggiano's for our out of state wedding reception. From the very first email inquiry, to picking up our items the day after our wedding, working with the staff at Maggiano's LV was a true and honest blessing. Our wedding day was perfect for so many reasons... one of the top being, we chose this restaurant venue. 

You would think planning an out of state reception by email correspondence would be hard? Nope. Not with Maggiano's LV. Beth and Jessie made our reception dreams come to life! They made the entire process easy and were always helpful- they were always focused on what we were envisioning. Out of every wedding vendor, they were always the quickest to respond. 

We were able to off our decorations the night before but we also had the option of shipping our items to the venue at anytime. We had all three banquet rooms reserved. 

When I walked into the reception, it was so hard to keep it together. It was even more beautiful than I could have imagined. They really went above and beyond with every detail. Not that you even need a lot of detail- the venue itself is gorgeous. You can't beat the view. 

The food- everyone still talks about the food. Seriously- we will not go back to Vegas without eating at Maggiano's. Just a few highlights of what was served (you can't go wrong with anything)- chicken saltimbocca, pesto alfredo cheese raviolis, meatballs and asiago crusted shrimp. Okay...now my mouth is watering. 

We set up our own iPhone for music- their audio system worked perfectly. There is plenty of dance floor space. 

The service was incredible. Like I said, Beth and Jessie were absolutely incredible to work with- Myself, my husband and my in-laws (everyone who worked with them closely) were all treated like family. There was another staff member who passed around our small plate food items and he constantly made sure myself and the wedding party ate. I honestly would have gotten a chance to try our food if it wasn't for him. I wish I would have gotten his name because so many guests enjoyed his friendly presence as well. 

I can't tell you enough how reassuring it was to know, all of our items would be kept safe until the next morning when we could pick them up. Not having to worry about that or having to ask a family member to stay back and do that was such a blessing. 

I could go on and on about how smooth our wedding reception went, thanks to Maggiano's LV, but then it would turn into a book. I promise you, you will not regret holding any special event here. Thank you everyone at Maggiano's LV!"}

{"text":"I was in Las Vegas this past weekend visiting a friend we had lunch here , we started off with a couple of Bloody Mary's which were right on point spicy . We then shared a plate of Fried Calamari as an appetizer which was excellent !

I had their Linguine Di Mare ( which consisted of Lobster , Shrimp , Mussels and Clams in a  soupy like red sauce excellent for bread dipping ) over Linguine , I have had this dish in New York Italian restaurants and it was exactly what I expected it to be and more it was awesome ! 

My friend had a Spinach Salad with grilled Shrimp which she loved ! 

The atmosphere and decor was very nice and if you didn't know it was a chain restaurant you would never expect it was , service was very good as well our waitress was very informative , helpful and polite though she was working us as tourist her routine came across as  scripted .

As for desert we were too full from the generous portions and just had a very nice cup of Espresso with some Sambuca .

I was also amazed at the pricing considering it's location to the Strip .

This is a must stop for any one who enjoys a good home / family style meal !"}
{"text":"This place is the GOAT; the service was excellent, we had a server named Ben who was accommodating, charming and quick. We celebrated a friend's birthday here and it was fantastic. 

Food was 10/10
Service was 10/10
Environment was 10/10 

I strongly recommend eating here.(-:"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. TOURISTS:  if you have leftover food, take it with u and walk to the nearest pedestrian bridge and give it to one of the many homeless there."}
{"text":"Great Lasagne uniquely special with a lot of sauce.  Chicken fricises and arugala salad was good, potatoes were dry and flavorless. Love the dine one take one special for 12.95. best value there. Everything else was moderate in price. Friendly wait staff. Very average."}
{"text":"A great place to visit if you are sick of the hotel buffets! The atmosphere was nice and cozy. We came in on a Saturday night and our option was to wait 4 minutes or sit at the bar for dinner. We sat at the bar! The food was great, huge portions! We figured out after the fact that they specialize in family portions. I ordered the half order of lobster ravioli and it was delicious! Five huge raviolis stuffed with big chunks of lobster and a great sauce! The portion of sauce was just right, it was not drowning in it! My friend ordered the Caesar salad and when they brought it out we actually started laughing because it was so huge! He managed to eat the whole thing though! As for drinks I had the watermelon martini and he had the classic martini...both were great! I would definitely visit again..."}
{"text":"Breaking News: Notorious Italian cuisine hater, Archie G., had Italian food for dinner and didn't immediately want to vomit afterwards.

On a business trip in Las Vegas, my speaking manager (who does not speak Spanish) asked me to help him take out our large limited our Latin American distributors (who don't speak English) for dinner. Somehow, I was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. Normally, I shy away from huge responsibility at work. I avoid the break room so I don't have to ever have to take out the trash. That's just how lazy I am.

Anyway, with this language challenged arrangement, I knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of Spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. Luckily for me, Maggiano's helped out with the experience.

The two Chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and Italian food. With the help of my Yelp Blackberry application, I suggested Benihana or Maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). Ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard Maggiano's and the date was set.

For starters, the staff here is a superb. The hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so I was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as I ran off and went shopping for a little gift for La Novia at the nearby mall. Our server was awesome. How lucky was I that the server was Chilean? He helped out immensely making our Chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. Great guy. Great server. Give that guy a raise.

As for the food, it wasn't terrible. We had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.

Appetizers: We had the \"Calamari Fritte\" and \"Stuffed Mushrooms.\" The fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially Ragu. I liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. However, I did wonder why they were not given an Italian name on the menu. Maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of Italian in college?

Salads: The \"Chopped Salad\" was a eally good salad. There is no way it can be good for you.  We also had the \"Italian Tossed Salad\" and it was wonderful. Who doesn't love a good tossed salad by an Italian?

Main courses: We ordered 4 different main courses. The \"Spaghetti, Meatball\" and I could have made it better at home. The \"Veal Ravioli\" was pretty good. It wasn't as heavy as I had imagined. The \"Gnocchi, Tomato Vodka Sauce\" was my contribution to the group. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth. It was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. The \"The \"Salmon, Lemon & Herb\" smelled pretty bad. I was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. I didn't want La Novia to pick me up from the airport and think I was having an affair or something.

Desserts: The Crème Brulee was pretty good. We had three rounds of this. I love burnt cream. We had the \"N.Y. Style Cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. I think the \"N.Y.\" stood for \"Not Your.\" As in, \"Not Your Style Cheesecake.\"

Overall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. It was factory style Italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. Essentially, it was a pricier version of \"Olive Garbage\" or \"Bucket of Crappo.\"

This was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. But the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. So successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general Las Vegas debauchery.

And well, I will award another star for that."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have the best Italian food I can find here in Vegas and their prices are pretty reasonable. I always bring my friends from out of town who come to visit here and they always like it. Get your Italian on!"}
{"text":"Went back again. Sat at the bar with a friend from Long Island, NY. We had a sensational dinner. Not good, but great. It's basic Italian food. Wine is reasonably priced. Same wine across the street at the Wynn is literally double per bottle."}
{"text":"Came her for my birthday and everything was amazing! Food was delicious,  I recommended the *lighter option*, drinks were above average, the view was amazing and the wait staff was one of the best I've seen in awhile! Plus I received a complimentary dessert plate for my birthday. Thank you !!!!"}
{"text":"From the stuffed mushrooms to the Rigatoni \"D\" this place delivers on tasty food. The Vegas strip location is one of the better spots in the chain I've visited."}
{"text":"Hmmmm the brunch wasn't really that good. I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was REALLY bland. It was breaded to perfection but had ZERO seasoning. The waffles and fruit were also really good. My husband had pancakes with eggs and honey ham. He loved the ham and eggs but he was not fond of the pancakes. I also had a sangria that was REALLY good. We probably won't come back for brunch but we will always be here for dinner :)"}
{"text":"I was absolutely impressed by every aspect of Maggianos. When we walked in, I expected to be met with resistance due to our reservations not working in their system, but they quickly worked us into a table as we had a show to make, and the waiter, Rafael, made sure he would have us served without leaving us in an anxious rush. He was quite courteous and refilled our bread and water while checking on us ever so often. 

I ordered a Manhattan clam chowder as an appetizer, a seafood linguine as an entree, and a sampler tiramisu for the dessert. If you are hungry, then this is the place for you because they are strong with their portions. The pricing is very fair for a decently fancy place. My entree was piled to the top with lobster, clams, and muscles; I actually wasn't able to finish all of it. This was the first time I've had Manhattan clam chowder which is a red tomato soup base instead of a white, and I enjoyed it very much. Everything was cooked to perfection on my plate, and the tiramisu dessert was also delicious. 

I would recommend this place highly for their customer service and food. They seem very flexible. If you're looking for an Italian place to eat at in Vegas tonight. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was terrific, thanks Lorenna. Food was mediocre. Price is not appropriate for the food quality. 

Considering that Trattoria Reggiana is only a 5 minute walk away, I'd go there instead. 

Details of my meal:
A cup of tomato soup comes in a very plain and small ramakan. The tomato soup was not good, suffering from overly roasted tomatoes.  In fact, the soup tasted just like the tomato sauce (also overly roasted tomatoes), but the soup had some cream added to it. 

Eggplant parmesan is good, but again the darned sauce...  Also, it comes on a bed of spaghetti pomodoro. The spaghetti suffered from too much time under a heat lamp, dried out and stale/chewy.  

The cocktails (I had a dark & stormy) were terrific. Wife had a Singapore Sling, and really liked it too. 

I was still hungry after my serving of eggplant, which was small. But I opted to just eat some more bread. I had gotten to a point where it seemed better to cut my losses."}
{"text":"Drove by saw the sign last time we stayed at the trump hotel hella close got hangry drove there! Sat in the patio didn't even have to wait that was a we got seated right away! I already knew what I wanted I did my research before we went there tonight... I don't know the servers name but I can describe him a older gentleman I wanna say he had  and was Asian \"philpino\" for sure I am just guessing he was very attentive we got our food extremely fast didn't have to wait eternity for the food to come out, ate paid and left took some foodie to go to our hotel room for later of course bc we will be hungry in a couple of hours. Usually I always get emails for coupons but since I live so far and my car is ancient I never drive that far, so it all worked out. Awesome service the guy server was so  I finally got to use my gcs I had I used all of them! #wordscannotdescribe"}
{"text":"Went here for work lunch. For easy parking we went to park at the Neiman Marcus side and take the elevator up. You would have to walk outside at the strip but the weather in October is perfect for a walk. If you want a shorter walk, there is a parking at the back thru the road between Trump Tower and Fashion Show Mall. 

Maggiano is located on the 3rd floor of the mall. You have option of dining inside or outside. There is a separate bar section if you just want to have some drinks. You can opt to eat at the bar as well. 

Their lunch service was pretty quick. Our food came in within 15 mins. Our server was terrific, polite, knowledgable about the menu and the special of the day (she mentioned the $5 mimosa). 

For appetizer, we had crispy calamari (I love calamari and this place has a great one). Next was a big plate of toothsome chopped salad with bacon and avocado! Anything with bacon is indeed delicious! And this one was no exception. Yumm. For the main entree I had shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. Generous portion of shrimps! The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was a little bland than the usual. 

Between the bread, appetizer, salad and entree, I was so full. So no desert today. 

Great spot for lunch! And will come back to try their Brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and EXCELLENT service. Drinks never ran out. I had the chicken Alfredo and my boyfriend had the eggplant Parmesan. The marinara in the eggplant parm was phenomenal. Loved the chicken in my Alfredo. I just really love this place"}
{"text":"If I'm vacationing and there is a Maggiano's in town, I'm going there.  Maggiano's is just that good.  This Maggiano's in Las Vegas makes the 12th Maggiano's I've visited.  The quality is the same in each location and the food ... OMGoodness is the food excellent.  The menu is close to the same across the U.S. with subtle changes based on region.

If you want to experience how a filet steak should taste; visit Maggiano's!  If you really want to temp the tastebuds, order the Filet Mignon & Asparagus Risotto.  Tooooooo Dieeeeeee Forrrrrrr!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the consistency of great service and good food here. The ambience is nice. You can comfortably bring your kids and not feel like you're disturbing anyone. They have a nice bar area too. 

You can bet that there will be a wait if you visit during prime hours on Fri or Sat. 

I also feel like you get a real bang for your buck with their special. You order from their classic pasta dishes and you get to take another home. It can be a totally different classic pasta dish. 

I don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan and love everything about Maggiano's. Decided to take the family as part of our Vegas Birthday weekend getaway. It was my sons 21st and wanted to make it special. Probably a little much for my kids (Young Adults). They are of the Vegas Buffet Breed. But they agreed to check it out.  Had a reservation and asked for the Best table in the house overlooking the Vegas Strip. Dinner was in typical Maggiano style. Hot, Full of Flavor, Huge in serving size just perfect. I would say the only down side was service. Granted the place was full and the it was a Vegas Friday night. Had to ask for water, drinks, rolls, the basics.  The server was not on his game at all. Shame normaly the staff goes above and beyond. Still we had a great dinner and I will be going back to my own local Maggiano's (Woodland Hills) hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Always a great dining experience at Maggiano's, I had previously eaten at Maggiano's in Atlanta, so I knew the food would be delicious. I had the Butter Nut Squash Ravioli, it was delicious.  The drink I had was a bit watered down, (I had their version of a top shelf margarita) I neglected to request no ice the first time, so the second time I ordered no ice and it was still weak and watery.  Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. Overall, it's a great place to dine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  My daughter in laws spoke highly about coming here, so we made the drive up to Cleveland for lunch.  When we arrived the lobby and bar area was very beautiful.  We ordered the meal for two and got a take home meal.  I ordered the eggplant parm.  It was pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The sauce was a bit bland.  I took home the mushroom ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  The sauce was very loose and overly salty.  I wasn't overly impressed with the food.  The service was great, and the value wasn't bad."}
{"text":"i would give it 5 stars.... any other time i would give this place 5 stars - because this place )and the bay area, CA one is amazing and have never had a negative moment....
BUT when i went 4/16/2012 - this evening - the inside host was absolutely pure rudeness!! first we went in with a reservation (why one makes reservations here - you still got to wait) we were early so that worked out because we got in just about right after our reservation time... when we walked in we were welcomed by 2 host, the girl on the right when you walk in took our name, and we asked her if we could sit outside, she rudely walkie her outside host and told us no seats available, we took our page and as we did I assured with her we would be seated outside, she said yes just wait until its our actual reservation.... our buzzer page and we came inside to thesame host, and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated, I said \"well be seated outside, right?\" host, \"no, you never said anything about wanting to be outside, if you wanted to sit outside all you had to do was ask the outside host and be seated out there\", here I bit my tongue from yelling or getting loud and i informed he that she never said any of that and that I had mentioned more than twice that we wanted to sit outside and recalled for her how she even called out to the outside host, the host stated \"oh that wasn't me, you must have talked to someone else\" so lets just say this went on for a few minutes, i was VERY UPSET!!
we had to walk ourselves outside and talk to the outside host ourselves to be seated.... our waiter Miguel - took our mind off it, made us laugh and was so good spirited....
he also can carry a couple arm full of dishes....
food is good!!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's can sometimes feel like an endless party. 

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my most favorite place for gnocchi....  The bartender ruined every ounce of my enjoyment!  
Typical middle aged, ugly, gross, miserable, divorce who hates her job and apparently needs to make her customers feel like shit!  Do not come here!!!!  It sucks!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for 7 people tonight. After repeating the order back to us correctly over the phone, we were assured when we picked up the order it was correct. The man said he had double checked everything. We drive home which is 7 miles away. Two orders were missing and the chicken on our salads were missing, as well. We called to let them know. They were not overly apologetic nor did they offer to bring it to us, like other restaurants have in the past. We drove back to the restaurant and no offer was made to rectify the situation. Customer service was lackluster. We could have been spending family time rather than driving back and forth. :("}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Food is way overpriced for its mediocre quality. For the same price, you can do yourself a favor a visit the real little Italy in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Before going to a show, we decided to get a bite to eat at Maggiano's. Though I should say many bites as the portions at Maggiano's are huge!

I ordered the rustic chicken and shrimp al forno with a Caesar's salad. It was really good. In fact my mom and her friend liked it so much they wished they had ordered it. The only bad part was I had to go out of town the next day so I wasn't able to keep the leftovers. It worked out great for my mom's friend though, who offered to take the leftovers!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food by far number one family restaurant! Used to go all the way to the strip at least once every 3 weeks now don't have to drive that far since they opened in Summerlin! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I took my father and little brother here last week. All three of us had fantastic dinners. My brother had of all things one of the best filet mignon's I have tasted in a long time. My father had a side dish of phenomenal asparagus spears. I had a perfectly seasoned seafood pasta dish, Not too creamy, or salty leaving room for the flavors of the shellfish to emerge and blend into the sauce. 

The service was excellent. There were no tables available in the dining room and the cocktail waitress did her best to make us feel like were not in the bar. 

I could be a \"chain restaurant\" snob and rip this place apart but I can't.... everything was very good. I would definitely recommend it for a quality meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"Sara our server was FANTASTIC.  We had a large group of 16 people for our wedding dinner.  I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance. They called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. I selected from the Chefs selection menu. Lobster baked tilapia, chicken parmesan, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. For appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  For dessert we selected creme brûlée and tiramisu. Absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! The meat entrees were all tender and juicy. Nothing was over cooked or under cooked. The food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  The portions and amount of food can be described as ABUNDANT. The customer service was perfect. They allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! I highly recommend them for special events!"}
{"text":"Amazing service every time. My boyfriend and I always get the four cheese ravioli and it comes with a take home dish as well. We eat up their amazing bread with the balsamic and oil. It really hits the spot. Simply the best."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service.  Loved that they have gluten free pasta choices.  Our whole party was  happy with their entrees.  The lobster carbonara was especially tasty.  Lost one star for wine list.  Not as robust as we'd hoped."}
{"text":"Family style is the way to go here, great deal, lots of good food and the service was great. The chocolate cake is super rich and the cheesecake is lighter then most which was a nice finisher. The best dish was the lagasana and for appatizer the calamari was worth ordering again. I would stick to the pasta entries or the shrimp preferably."}
{"text":"this place is awesome, the food is delicious, and the staff is very friendly. yes wait times can get a little long but it's a BRAND new restaurant in a BRAND new neighborhood in Las Vegas. what are people expecting ? DO NOT listen to the bad reviews this place rocks"}
{"text":"Tried another restaurant today, at Park Road Shopping Center and it was so bad I left and went to Maggianos at South Park.  
How wonderfully consistent your food and service is.
Love your food and I have never had bad service.  I have never been disappointed with Maggianos and will eat there as long as you exist.
Thank you for what you do.  You do it so well."}
{"text":"Maggianos was just ok. It wasn't bad but there are other options in the area. The service was good no complaints. They don't have any draft of craft beers but the holiday decor was festive. Again the food wasn't bad it just wasn't the greatest. I ordered the chicken piccata. We also ordered the clams in red sauce which were descent but could have used more sauce or spice to it. The angel hair pasta that came with the chicken was good it was just a little plain and could have used more garlic or something. The bruschetta we ordered was tasty."}
{"text":"We showed up got seated right away and was greeted by our server Kevin who was amazing very friendly and just made it special, Thank you! The food and drinks were amazing! Every one of my friends were impressed and enjoyed their meal and drinks. Had a great time, thank you!"}
{"text":"Went on Easter, great service, great food, highly recommend the lobster carbonara !!!
Great Food
Great Service"}
{"text":"Maggianos is pretty good. Family style meal is okay but really the girl started being pushy to clear plates when we were still eating and chatting. For 33 dollars a head she should have just let us eat. Anyway...the manicotti was great. The tilapia was not. The brûlée was great...awesome flavor. The Caesar salad was also good as was the artichoke dip. The entrees were not the highlight. Okay but really expensive."}
{"text":"We took the kids to Vegas for Spring Break last week.  Yeah, I know.  Why the hell would anyone want to go to Vegas with minors?  Ask my wife.  Anyway, we needed to find a place with food that was better than McDonald's for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us.

I had the nifty Yelp app on my new, handy dandy Crackberry and it pointed us to Maggiano's.  The app provided many positive Yelp reviews ( of dubious value as usual), a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease.

We were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and I in spite of the antics of my three little darlings.  It can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good.

The have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked.  My wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and I ordered chicken francesca, which was supposedly inspired by the Italian cuisine from St, Louis.  Having become intimately familiar with St. Louis Italian cuisine over the years I think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good-especially for a chain.  The price was very reasonable and I would love to dine here again but I'm not planning to go to Vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in Orange County.  Perhaps they'll open a San Diego location some day."}
{"text":"Service was good but I had to wait 30 minutes to be seated and all together it took about 2.5 hrs from start to finish. But even besides that, I gave it 3 stars because I ordered the special where you pick 1 starter, 2 pastas, 1 dessert, and 2 pastas to go. Calamari was good. Mushroom ravioli was delicious. Creme brulee was not good. When I got home to put my to go pastas in the fridge, one of my orders was incorrect which is dissapointing. And I tasted it (i think it was just regular spaghetti) and i wasn't impressed. Super disappointed. If I got the correct To go pasta, I probably would have marked it with 4 stars if it tasted good."}
{"text":"If they are open for business, it is busy! Simple as that. The food is amazing and the crowds come here to show their love!
We did not have a reso, came for a late lunch on a Wed and got in no prob around 130pm.
We had the best waitress in the world and from where we live north of the border at times, this can be hard to come by! Was really pleased with the service!
I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was done to perfection with succulent shrimp all over the plate. The pasta cooked perfectly al dente. Large shrimps , I must have had about a dozen of them mixed amongst the butter, lemon and halved cherry tomatoes. My mom's salad (Caprese) was to die for and even though mom had requested salad dressing on the side and it was mixed in, she just let it go and did not say a peep. When our waitress had come over to check on us, she saw the error right away as she had not delivered the food to us. She asked if we would like the salad remade, that it was perfectly fine for her to do that for us! We delcined, but nice touch! The salad was HUGE! Super fresh and tasty, loaded with all the good stuff that makes a salad sing. The bread that came with the meal = cooked on site, very good as well.
We were too full for dessert but got to bring half my scampi to the hotel with me. Great value, incredible food and top-notch service. With so many dining options available in Vegas we do not usually go to the same place twice but Maggiano's just hits the spot for greatness and we will return again and again!
Gotta love the Frank Sinatra music!"}
{"text":"Went for a Feb 17 valentines dinner with my wife. We were in our 60's. Made the drive from Maricopa 1 HR 10 MIN. Been here many times. Always make reservations on open table. As is the case each and every time other than your name on the list. The time of your reservation means absolutely nothing. Total incompetent reservation system. We have waits of anywhere 30-90 minutes with our open table reservations or any other call in reservation. After a long wait we were sat at a both by reservation desk. Either the table is too low or the seat is to high. Granted the seats are totally jammed in an old and need replacing. You can't get to eat the food on your plate without contorting your body to somehow bend over to get to it. The height is off. In over 50 yrs of eating in any type restaurant diner or dive I have never encounter a table like this except maybe in some exhibit in an amusement park. What am I supposed to do after a long wait to be seated for my reservation. Then sat down in a table from hell that made my back disability flair. Then my veal parmiagano comes out over cooked. Usually it's 5 star this time no star. I refuse to complain on Valentine's Day and ruin my wife's evening. Turns out she complained about something wrong with the table height on the hour ride home. By the way thank God like the other reviews my wife was smart enough to check for our 2 extra orders to take home. We were missing 2 of the 4 and would have drove home to MARICOPA WITHOUT IT. Are you serious doing this to other customers also.! I never gave Maggiano's less than 5 stars. We bring family and friends besides our special Christmas and valentine dinners and birthdays here but not after this last visit.  After reading other reviews, if this is the way you treat your excellent customers, watch out. You want excellent Itallian read my other reviews. This is customer disservice at its highest level.. If you think people don't know what's going on you will find out soon enough in life you get back what you give. We both loved to come here and supported this restaurant. My mama didn't raise no fool. I' be eaten in the fines restaurants and the diners and dives. Something is has turned rotten in this Dining Establishments experience. When something is rotten I toss it in the garbage. I am not stupid , I am a nice caring decent human being. I enjoy restaurants that treat me that way. Don't hand me crap you know is over cooked for me to complain about. I'm not there to complain. Don't sit me in some God forsaken table that needs fixing or replacing and causes customers pain. You can't be that stupid.Sit in it eat in it. Then rip it out. Shame on you. I don't need to request get me out of the s__it hole on Valentine's Day. I can't be the only 2 people who ever sat there and complained. Just like we can't be the only people that never had a reservation that was even close!. Would you come back to this restaurant after reading this 100% true experience.?  I wouldn't! , I'm not into the pain thing!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit and Maggianos was delicious again. The food portions are great and the service was great."}
{"text":"What to say about this place. It is our fav spot for Italian food. 

Awesome Service 
Awesome Long Island Drinks 
Awesome Food 

I just hope they will not disappoint me ever because i just cant stop comparing others with them :)"}
{"text":"We had a larger party (10) and the servers were on top of it for Sunday lunch.
Food was excellent-- everyone was happy.
Service was very good-- very congenial
Have had similar very positive experiences here.  Keep up the good work. 
Check them out!"}
{"text":"My most favorite Italian restaurant! The mushroom ravioli with alfredo sauce is to die for. Go between 4-6pm and they have happy hour in the entire restaurant. The flatbreads are only $4 on happy hour and sooooo good. The bread is delicious. I always get the classic pastas and you get one to take home for free. It is such a good deal!!"}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant! 3 of us arrived with no reservations on a Wed. night at 6:30. We had to wait almost 40 minutes for a table, so reservations would be advised. We came to have some favorite dishes. Chicken Saltimboca, Chicken Picata, and the buy one get one pasta. It didn't disappoint. They serve fresh hot french bread while you are waiting for your dinner. The service was fairly prompt even though it was extremely busy. The two chicken dishes were $18.95 each, which I thought was a little pricey since they don't come with anything else. The portions are generous, the food was served hot, chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was very noisy in here,  so if you want a romantic evening, this isn't the place - you can barely hear other people speaking.

I was thinking of another restaurant when I suggested coming here. I think I prefer Macaroni Grill. It was a nice meal, just not awesome."}
{"text":"Try try try the Tuscan Mussels. Never would I have thought I'd like \"sea slugs\". But I could not get enough of these!
I'd give this place 5 stars but for the price, the service was lacking.  Our server didn't get all of our order right and our drinks took forever."}
{"text":"''We all [family] stepped in here for just simply dessert after eating elsewhere nearby! The service was less than desired AT THE OTHER PLACE.''  so off we went and found Maggiano's for Dessert!'' I have not yet eaten here that is yet except for the desserts that night which were great! My next annual trip down to Las Vegas when I'm in the mood for Italian which I probably will be? Maggiano's Little Italy of course!''  And I must mention the service here was excellent.  ''Thank you''"}
{"text":"We really like this chain. Good quality food, fair pricing, large portions, nice decor and excellent service. The family style is great for large parties, everyone gets to share. We ate here tonight for our anniversary. Our server, Christine, was excellent. We had the chicken parmesana and the tomato basil soup, with a bottle of 14 hands merlot. Everything was delicious! 
Only suggestions, please notice water glasses and bread need refilling. Also, a few more options for vegetarians would be appreciated. There are usually more items to choose from when eating Italian food. We always know we will have an enjoyable meal at Maggianos"}
{"text":"I haven't gone to a Maggiano's in a long time, first time in the Vegas location too.  I made a reservation on the phone for 6:30pm, we got there by 6pm so I asked them if we could be seated.  They were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat.  Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall.  She didn't go over the specials either but no problem since I can read it myself.  

Ordered the half order spinach salad (I always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side.  Did it again this time too and they put way too much).  I remember it tasting a little better but it's probably because there was too much dressing.  I do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though.  Also ordered the calamari.  It was okay but I wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain.  The warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy.  

I only ordered two pastas for three people (waitress said all their dishes are now \"half order\" sized).  Thank goodness I did too because the portions were still pretty big, plus I was already more than half-full from the appetizers and bread.  Got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine.  The pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto, a little too much but when I reheated it the next day, it was so good.  The seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy.  We took back over 2/3 of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then, even for dessert.  

Although the waitress wasn't talkative with us, she refilled our water, checked up on us, and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when I asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas.  Good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant- casual elegant, and everything on the menu is fantastic!  We bring friends here when they're in town and always remind them to save room for dessert.  The service is always great too- love this place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Impressive! I was invited here for a networking lunch a few months back. By mere appearance from the outsode, I didn't realize how big Maggiano's is. Once I entered I was greeted by friendly hostesses. The group I was meeting was upstairs in a large \"ballroom.\" The atmosphere was open and decorated nicely.

The food was delicious! I ate so much of the multiple appetizers (calamari, bruchetta, fried zucchini, etc.) that I barely had room for the main courses. The cheesecake was a great way to top off the dining experience. I left one happy girl!

The service was great too! Very attentive, yet nondistracting. Being in the large room kept our event private and the noise level down. The rest of the restaurant seemed very busy. 

If you are looking for a place to host your event (business party, reception, etc.) they do it well. I plan on returning here!"}
{"text":"An extremely solid chain Italian restaurant with a location in Beachwood Place.  When I came here with two friends we were promptly seated outside, as requested on the patio.  We split the 2 for $40 special, which is an absolutely tremendous bargain and enough to feed 3 people.  This deal includes an appetizer, two pasta entrees, desert and your choice of two pasta entrees to take home.  Just think about that---that's a sh-load food for $40.

As our appetizer we ordered a fried zucchini dish which was fresh, crisp and came with this absolutely delicious sauce.  Definitely try it.  For our entrees we ordered the egglaplant parm, which was pretty much perfect, as well as the cheese ravioli which was rich, but yet satisfying and not overbearing.  To finish things off we had a slice of cheescake which was slightly fluffy, but nevertheless tasty and enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

The next day I was split the aglio bowtie pasta and fettuccine Alfredo with my mom and brother.  The bowtie pasta was my favorite dish from Maggianos.  It was topped with some veggies and had a very nice olive-oil and Parmesan cheese based topping to it.  The fettuccine alfedo also was tasty, though was a bit too rich for my tastes.  

The service at the restaurant was pretty solid.  It would have been nice had our waitress been slightly more attentive with regards to making sure we had enough water.  Other than that, we had a great experience.  I strongly recommend this place to those looking for great Italian food."}
{"text":"I made a reservation well in advance for a special event in December. We were a party of 12 and I called to confirm my reservation. There was no credit card deposit required for a large group. When we arrived we still had to wait quite a while. There was a party of about 20 seated directly behind our table and we were really stuffed in there. There was almost no room and certainly out table was not large enough for 12 people! So we had to stand in the aisle and wait for an adjacent table to open up, so part of our party could be seated there. So, we had a table and a close by booth. This was super disappointing since it was a special occasion and since we had made reservations far in advance and confirmed them. No manager came by to address the issue, offer us a free appetizer for the mistake, or really any sort of apology! Generally, they just didn't seem to care. The food was pretty average and somewhat cold with the exception of the zucchini appetizer which was excellent. Our server was excellent albeit slow, which was likely due to a backup in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by a trip to Maggiano's a little over a month ago during a visit to Las Vegas.  I normally avoid chains, but this one is worth visiting again.

The appetizers were all very good (we went during happy hour).  The main courses were huge and moderately priced.  The service was very fast without bring rushed and our waitress was friendly.

The location is convenient on the front of the Fashion Show Mall.  Easy access from The Wynn, which is where I was staying.  Plenty of on-site parking as the mall has every parking option under the sun."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for lunch with my parents and I was very pleased. It was a little busy when we got there, but we were still seated right away and given bread to snack on while we decided what to order.

We ordered a caesar salad for the table, and it was very good. I ended up getting the four-cheese ravioli since I love pesto-alfredo sauce, but I was a bit surprised that it came with a strip of marinara sauce down the center. It was a bit sweet for my tastes (and I'm not a huge fan of marinara), but everything else was absolutely delicious. Even got some fettuccine alfredo to take home as part of the meal!

We got the apple crostata for dessert, which was also very good. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, so her alone honestly made me want to go back! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Incredible for something that should be ordinary, as it is a chain restaurant. Chain restaurants are notorious for food that puts the soul to sleep, but Maggiano's serves toasty, hearty delights that nourish.

Service can be a hit or miss, most of the time a hit but getting servers on their off days is a possibility, especially on a busy night. But Maggiano's stands out above other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"We have dropped in to Maggiano's approx. 10 times in the past 2 years & we have been pleased every time. On 2 occasions we went with a large group including small children. They sat us upstairs so the kids would not on the nerves of any of the downstairs patrons & we all appreciated that. The service has always been above average & I am totally addicted to the lobster carbonara.  Very generous portions on all menu items. The soups are also outstanding. I highly recommend if you want to drop in for a quick lunch or a more formal evening dinner."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have dined here many times and they have yet to disappoint. I'm usually a stickler on details but I've left a happy customer time and time again I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My experience last night at Maggiano's was impressive and disappointing at the same time. 

I made a reservation for 6 people for Mother's Day dinner.  We were being seated to our table and we headed to the back room where I guess they do private parties.  It didn't excite my Mom to be in the back room where a lot of the screaming kids were so we asked for a table in the dining room and it wasn't a problem.  

Matt was our server for the evening.  He told my Mom happy Mother's Day and she just loved that coming from such a good looking guy!  Matt was awesome, service was great.  I hope to have him as a server again. 

My disappointing part of the evening was my food.  I had the Gnocchi which was cold and the portion size was small.  The plate and marinara sauce was hot but the gnocchi was not.  I have been to Maggiano's many times before and have had the gnocchi many times before and it's always a good size portion and is hot.   Everyone else's food at my table was a big size and was at the right temperature.  So I ate some of my husband dish, the rustic chicken and shrimp which was very good, not to mention hot and a good portion.  I asked Matt for a box and he boxed it up for me so I could take it home and heat it up myself.  

To get my experience on the positive side, I twisted my own arm and ordered the tiramisu.  Yeah, it's up on my top 5 tiramisu's I've ever had.  I highly recommend ordering it and sharing it. 

I will go back to Maggiano's and I probably won't order the gnocchi again due to the portion size. $15 for what I got last night, 75 cents per gnocchi piece was not worth it. 

My star rating for service is 5 stars and my rating for the gnocchi is a 1 star."}
{"text":"We had our holiday party at Maggiano's this week and it was PERFECT! The restaurant looked beautiful and everything, from the food selection to the service, was a 10!  We had our own private space and the attention to detail was really impressive.  A big thank you to Erin, the Banquet and Catering Manager!  She really made our event special and was so patient with us.  Great job by everyone at Maggiano's!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service.  Both apetizer and main was exelent. Maybe the best chiken i have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I was searching for some good Northern Italian food. Looking for some good Linguini and clams and have been to the Orange County location several times so I took my chances with the most touristy location and was quite surprised with how quick our order was served and the quality of the food. It was a busy night but they had ample staff. I would of given a full five stars but the waiter never asked or brought us more bread, even though the two small pieces we recieved were gone within 5 min. I would still come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Took my mom to dinner sat in the bar and had Rachel as our server.  She was one of the best waitresses I have had in a long time.  It made the dining experience so enjoyable.  I will recommend people to ask for her.  The food was excellent as well and did the dinner for 2 and still got to bring home another pasta to go.  Will definitely be back to enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Liz was very helpful on her recommendations for what my wife and I should eat everything was perfect. Order the chicken Parmesan"}
{"text":"We placed an order for takeout and my husband went to pick it up we had the lasagna and the four cheese ravioli. Everything was nice, warm, and delicious! Never a disappointment with this place. Thank you:)"}
{"text":"Best chain Italian restaurant. We have been to the one in Vegas and Cherry Hill. Pretty consistent food, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I love to go to the strip location. The food is excellent, the view of the strip beautiful and the atmosphere and the service impecable.
We always go there when there's family in town. They can get a little piece of the strip experience with fresh italian food at great prices."}
{"text":"Service was slow and not great. Seen waitress standing around while I was out of water and out of bread for nearly 20 mins. She was overly attentive to table next to us due to getting the order wrong continually. I had to ask for a dessert menu twice and she still hasn't came back to take our order for at least 15 mins as our corrected meal was brought out by a different staff member ( we asked for it to go so we could make a movie but it's still sitting in front of us, plated.) We love the spinach manicotti though, so we'll be back. Hopefully with better wait staff, especially on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and Maggianos was a restaurant I frequented in my college days in Chicago. It's been consistently excellent over the years. Everything from the bread to my favorite classic chicken parm to the delicious profiteroles, is outstanding. I mixed it up today and went with the piccata and I was very pleased. I've never had any issue with service and I've sat in the bar frequently as well as the dining room. The bar area is nice and open with sports on the TV's and Sinatra playing overhead. Maggianos is always a great spot for some Italian comfort food, lunch or dinner! If you're in a group, the family style dining is a great option and totally worth it.. Huge portions and they keep coming! It is a chain, but it's a good one that has been on my list of regular spots for over a decade."}
{"text":"Excellent. I had a party of 10 for my 50th birthday and food and service was perfect. I will go back again. No complaints."}
{"text":"What an Amazing location. I am so pleased I no longer have to go to the Las Vegas strip and into a mall for this food. The staff at maggianos downtown summerlin are top notch. The food was hot and fresh not from under a heat lap. The dinner for 2 is such a deal by 2 meals take 2 home."}
{"text":"Great Italian food with portions designed to share.

And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!"}
{"text":"I go here every. single. time. I visited Las Vegas for my tiramisu craving. Even though I've lost my craving for sweets these days, I still come here for that heaping slice.

I usually go get it at their to go counter in the back, and they have seats. Sure, the wait time is a little long and sometimes, I have to ask around for a to go person. And I'm not gonna lie, the first time I got lost, but overall, I know where to go now. Seeing how I'm moving back to Las Vegas, I'm going to try to abstain going here as much just so I don't get fat!

The slice itself in to go always seems to make me happy that I get it. They put the slice on chocolate sauce and it seems to be garnished so nicely. Though, I think I'm only going to order at the to go counter, seeing that the last time I order it at the bar, they kind of just got the slice and didn't really do much with it. Still tasted great, but I actually do enjoy how they garnish it.

Putting all of that aside. The restaurant and its food is just as splendid altogether. I've eaten there with a friend and they give a great size in portions. Don't remember what I ordered, but then again, it's pasta~! I felt full and happy afterwards!

I like it here. I hope it stays for a very long time, despite renovations at the mall! Thanks guys~"}
{"text":"Much needed lunch with not such a big price tag as most places on the strip. We had a small appetizer of their seasonal shrimp. MUST HAVE. We then shared the salmon club sandwich. Good tasting, could have had more seasoning, but all was yummy. Food was well proportioned and they served bread as well. So, very filling, excellent management services bc our waitress forgot to place our food order and we sat for a long time. Otherwise a wonderful experience . We will be back. Great for kids as well as a nice get a way lunch."}
{"text":"Love the holiday decor they have here!!! I've never been to Maggiano's during the holidays and let alone in Downtown Summerlin. The vibe is very warm and I enjoyed the ambience. 
I ordered the Chicken & Spinach manicotti. A great plate and serving size was perfect. They serve bread prior to your meal plus olive oil & vinegar, you'll have to request butter if you want that with the bread instead. 
The service was ok, I was expecting a little more energy and attentiveness from our waitress but she did recommend a great appetizer (Grilled Shrimp topped with a basil garlic bread topping). The food was great and the menu is awesome! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place isn't always crowded. The food is great and wait times for seating, ordering, food, etc. aren't bad. I've been here three times for lunch during the weekday and weekend and their prices are reasonable for being so accessible from the strip. I bring my out of town guests here and my aunt likes to come eat here whenever she visits (all the way from Oklahoma!)."}
{"text":"Hands Dow the worst Italian and possibly the worst food I have ever had.  This chain has never been great, but it was surprisingly bad.  My wife and I had two bites from our pasta dishes, both popular recommended dishes and couldn't eat any more.  I have had better pasta from a microwave meal.  Bland flavors, over cooked pasta that had been reheated into a mush.  Absolute disaster!"}
{"text":"Once again, having walked for far too long without eating, the girls and I settled on Maggiano's because it was close and there was bread to eat while waiting. (Yes... we were that hungry).

The server was nice , the food was just what we needed, and the prices were decent enough ($29 for two entrees and a drink). However, I don't know if it was because we were seated outside or what, but our glasses were empty for a long time and we actually had to ask the server for more water. Keep in mind, this was around 2:30pm and it wasn't really that busy... so if it's during peak meal time and you're starved, you might be better served elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious lasagna. My husband and I ordered two chopped salads and one lasagna and it wAs plenty of food. Salads, bread, and lasagna were delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple of days ago! I had a great experience here. The waiter Stacy was great he was able to describe and recommend dishes to us. He was attentive Came by and asked how we were enjoying our meals and how everything was. 

We ordered the Rigatoni D which was pretty good. I had the chopped salad which I thought was good. I can see that place getting packed around dinner and lunch time.  wouldn't mind coming back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"We spend our winters in Scottsdale.
We look forward to several visits to Maggianos as part of our trip.

We love the great big portions of all the appetizers and my husband loves the veal chop and the fresh veggies.

This year we visited  and found the veal chop is gone from the menu, the salads have shrunk to 1/2 their size and the veggies ( spinach) came to the table with the spinach stems hanging off their dish,
Like someone didn't take care to plate it properly.

When we spoke to the manager he apologized but blamed the changes on corporate. 

It's just NOT the Maggianos we have come to expect. With all the wonderful restaurants in this area we will not be returning.

It seems to me that Maggianos should just reopen as Olive Garden and stop pretending to be something else"}
{"text":"This review is for the service that we received at dinner last week. Our waiter Donny was the worst waiter we have ever had! If you go to Maggiano's and get Donny as your waiter prepare to be insilted and treated like idiots when you ask him a simple question. No need to go into details but trust me on this. It is a shame because the waiter serving the table next to us was absolutely wonderful and very professional. Note to Donny, if you do not like people you probably should get out of the customer service business."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I love to eat here with my family for birthdays and such.
They have some of the best Italian food I have ever tasted. There's really good spaghetti, Fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli (my favorite with or without greens), and chicken Parmesan. They also have this stuff called onion strings (like a small, classy plate of mini, entangled onion rings) that is cravable, especially with the creamy, lemonish sauce. You have to ask for it on the side, though, or you may not get it.
The atmosphere is really nice, too, especially if you're in the room surrounded by windows (unless someone suicidal brought a pet rock as their date).
They give you a dessert on your birthday. They used to be lemon cookies, but I think they changed it to cake. I don't particularly like the desserts, but my family LOVES those lemon cookies!
Overall, this is one of the best Italian places. Period."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Waiter kept disappearing, bread was about a week old and eggplant parm was gross.  Manager took it off lithe bill but still we won't be going back.  Manager nice and trying hard but not worth it.  Took 35 minutes to get our check, pay our bill and get the heck  out!   Who has that kind of time?"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Maggiano's in the Fashion Show mall. It was a nice setting with an outdoor area. We sat indoors, but we had a great view of the Palazzo hotel. Overall a gorgeous window view.

Ordered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an Arnold Palmer. The veal scallopine was flavorful, especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation. There was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal. It was a light bed of spinach and I felt that I could have benefited with a bit more. The dish came with a side of angel hair. As for the drink, it was just your typical Arnold Palmer, half iced tea half lemonade.

Our server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients. At first I thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host, but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well-trained and sociable. I applaud the servers for their knowledge and service.

Overall it was a good experience, but not a restaurant of choice since it's a chain. When I am in Vegas, I prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive Vegas restaurants. I feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown."}
{"text":"First we tried brunch and it was sooo delicious!  The lemon ricotta pancakes didn't even need syrup.  The Italian American breakfast, bacon was super thick, Italian sausage is made in house.   With our email coupon w tip we spent under $40.

Tonight we went for dinner and had the Marco special,  a starter, two pasta plates and dessert.   We had sausage N peppers appetizer, I had the lasagna. the chocolate cake for dessert.   Plus we got two plates to take home, which is part of the special.  We also tried the bruschetta  bar.  Was sooo amazing !  We spent $50 for dinner and have leftover for two days. 
My parents are from Italy, so I am very picky bout Italian food but I had to ask for more bread to soak up all the gravy from my lasagna, it was so good."}
{"text":"Great food, rude disinterested employees.  We made a reservation via Open Table but the restaurant was absolutely PACKED and obviously overbooked.  Person seating us was unable to assist so we just waited around and found a table for ourselves on the outside mall patio.   Waiter was awesome but too busy to pay any attention to us.   \"Free\" photographer was seriously annoying and not free."}
{"text":"The food here is great when they get it right.... the problem is we are looking at 1 for 5 now.  I thought maybe it was just because I usually ordered take out during peak times - but this last time they screwed up my take out order 3 times trying to fix it.... I order what I want off the menu that I have - they read it back and it sounds great - they tell me 20min. I walk in 25 min later and they have half the order and not made the way it was ordered or repeated.  Then tell me they will go get the rest of it and it will be 10 min - so I open up what they had after they assured me it was made correctly .... sadly no, not what I ordered at all. Told them to fix it. Waited another 20 min. Told the hostess that was doing her best to pretend I wasn't there to just cancel my order that I wanted my money back - got on her little CIA headset and seconds later here comes a manager with my order acting like he didn't just get the message I wanted my money back - then had the bad taste to give me a dirty look lol I inconvenienced him LOL! I guess even though they do their best to make up for screw up after screw up - they forget that they have a job because if their patrons.  I honestly am disappointed every time I start thinking how good the lighter fare fettuccine Alfredo is when it's done right and then I remember it's never done right and I end up getting home with something I didn't want.  They have given me my money back the last few times and let me keep what I didn't order - they thought hey had fixed it (so did I until I got home) - so you get 2 stars for trying. Thank you 
- updated - 
Decided to try my luck again and we got it right! 2 for 6! Seriously when they do it right it's great food - just disappointed that more often than not a take out order is 40 min of waiting for it to be fixed.
Thank you to the people working last night for not disappointing me again!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time when we go to Maggiano's to eat. Reservations are a must on weekends. The food is great and we love dessert. We've also had Thanksgiving dinner here and loved it as well! Staff is always attentive and superb."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, excellent food, as usual. I love this new location! Vera was a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  They have a proseco made just for them from Italy. We did the dinner for 2 deal which lets u take  a pasta home! They also have gluten free potions and low cal."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch on our first day and was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken parmesan and it was plenty for the both of us. The peach bellini cocktail was to die for! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf twice, absolutely delicious first time around, slightly overcooked second time. Service was very friendly. Will give them five stars as the second surf and turf was prepared during lunch hours and was not on menu."}
{"text":"Food and our server were outstanding for a lunch for two on Sat 3/1/14. Prices are surprisingly reasonable for a white tablecloth restaurant on the Strip (lunch for 2 under $40 with tip). The only blemish on an otherwise pleasant lunch was a hostess who didn't care that we could see her face when she rolled her eyes when we asked for a booth. She bumped an otherwise 4 star rating down to a 3."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was good. Arrived early for reservation was told could not be seated until time. Was finally seated 15 minutes late. Then had to move due to a party coming in. Ordered bottle of wine for 4 and it was not evenly divided so last person got nothing, server then suggested we redistribute the wine. Fortunately the food made up for a lot of it."}
{"text":"It's safe to say, I'm a Maggiano's regular. & I think the Vegas location is probably the best one- overlooking the Strip, yet safely located in the Fashion Show mall & not quite 'on the Strip'. Fun for people watching during the day (love sitting outside, if not too cold, hot or windy!) then transforms at nite when the 2 windowed walls facing the Strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz & beauty of the Vegas lights. While ambiance is a factor in why I like Maggiano's, consistency is the reason I go back time & time again. I don't believe I've ever had a bad meal or experience there (other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites). Unbeknownst to me, at some point, Maggiano's even changed ownership; I couldn't tell, because unlike other cases when there's an ownership change, nothing about the quality changed. I'm part of their email list so I get emails with coupons every couple months. A few no-fails on the menu: tomato caprese, stuffed mushrooms, rigatoni d (though not great for leftovers, because of the cream sauce), mom's lasagna (had it for the 1st time last nite & it's one of the best, not too mushy), eggplant parm (generous portion), the best chicken parm I've ever graced my mouth with & linguine di mare (substantial seafood). For dessert, if you're still feeling gluttonous, go for the apple crostada... otherwise, we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge. Also, keep Maggiano's in mind for Thanksgiving & Christmas dining, if you're in town visiting or if you just don't feel like cooking- they do a wonderful job with the menus & you'll surely have leftovers, for a reasonable price. It's easy to mosey in & be seated right away for lunch but I recommend reservations for any time after 4:00."}
{"text":"i am a HUGE Maggianos fan at the Bellevue Washington location and was excited to see one of my favorite places on the strip. 

we get to the restaurant at 5ish. with a party of 5. we are told about 1-1.5 hour wait. okay no problem after looking around and seeing countless open tables we ask why cant we sit at one of the patio tables, they responded with they are reserved but we don't know when they are showing up.. 

we finally take a seat after an hour wait for the table that was previously reserved but the group never showed up.. i was over it and excited and very hungry. 

we ordered the first all you can eat family deal the food was amazing as always. 

the service was slow, couldn't answer simple menu questions.. do you meatballs have pork in them? (they don't they are 100% beef)

up to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized, sloppy and chaotic. it took 20 minutes to get bread on the table.

------THE REASON FOR 1 STAR------

we were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table. as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about 5\" it turns out there was a hole about 2-3\" deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room.. i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me. i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said WHEN I WAS IN THE HOLE PULLING MY CHAIR BACK OUT. \"OH YEAH THERE IS A HOLE THERE\" WTF kind of observation is that. if you know about a preexisting hazard FIX IT!!!

long story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting. we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems.  i wasn't about to have my last night in Vegas be ruined by that. for my Pain and all this we got 25% taken off the bill. and i left hurting and in pain.


i think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard, have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldn't have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt."}
{"text":"2 stars is generous after my last trip there which was on Thanksgiving. It was my 4th year in a row eating here on Thanksgiving. I booked a month out and was told the earliest available was 7:15pm. We were seated quickly but that's the only thing that went right. We ordered all parts of the 5 course family style holiday menu and half of what we ordered showed up. They ran out of food at an \"all you can eat\" meal. Instead of being upfront with us we got a dog and pony type of magic show \"disappearing food\". When I approached the manager he asked\" what do you want me to do about it?\" Are you kidding me? $35 per person and you do not have what we want? I am fairly certain I will never go back, that's coming from a Chicago guy who loves Italian food. Also their regular menu item portions have been cut in half and the price slashed a buck or two. Lame."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar and had dinner watching the Cardinals game. They have Peroni on tap which is good.  The Chicken Marsala is phenomenal , the Chicken Parm not so much. The warm bread before the meal is excellent. The tiramisu is excellent too. Service at the bar is excellent. Men's room is exceptionally clean.
I prefer to avoid chain restaurants but this one is pretty good.
Four Stars, would return."}
{"text":"Dined here several times over the past two years.  If I didn't know better, I'd of thought this was opening night with new service staff and kitchen help.  What a disaster.  Reservation for 6:30 and didn't get seated until 6:45 (not that would be a reason to write a bad review, but that was to protend what was to follow).  We were seated and then ignored for 15 minutes until a member of our party got up and walked over to the beverage/service area which was less than 6 feet away from our table and asked the three servers standing there if anyone of them was assigned to our table.  One said no it was so and so's table and she was no wheres to be found.  He at least came over and filled our water glasses.  As we already had plenty of time to decide what to eat from staring at the menu for 15 minutes, he also took our orders.  About 10 minutes later another waitress came by and took our beverage orders. So now we've been seated for 30 minutes and just getting to be able to order a beverage.  Anther 10 minutes goes by and the appetizer arrives and it's just room temperature when it should of been hot.  A third waitress now appears and asks us how the appetizer is and we tell her it's cold and she wants to know if we want another.  No, just take this away and please credit the bill.  And now the rolls appear(the excuse is that the oven is not working so that's why it took 45 minutes for the rolls to arrive).  One member of our party had ordered a salad.  No where to be seen until we ask the third server that we are missing the salad.  She blames the kitchen for not delivering the salad.  Now a manager appears at the table apologizing for one-after-another gaffes we are expieriencing.  But from looking around at other tables, it appears we all are the victims of poor service as everyone is waiting for either food, drinks or the bill.  1 hour and 10 minutes later, the food finally arrives which was good as usual.  But the hassles of getting the food to the table is just not worth the exercise in frustration.  There are 100's of other places to eat in Charlotte and we'll be going someplace else from here on out.  We didn't know how much of a tip to leave as we never could figure out who was actually our assigned server.  Seemed like we had every staff member in the place at our table over the 2 hour meal.  And couldn't figure out if the service was bad, kitchen was under seige or the whole place was inept.  We did leave a tip larger than what I thought they deserved but since it'll be our last visit there, we chalked it up to a parting gift."}
{"text":"It's been a while since being to Maggiano's - my last visits were around opening a few years ago.
How can you go wrong here....especially with Italian!! I forgot that all of the portions are huge here -so some sharing was in order.
Bryan and I decided to visit for his birthday (YAY!!!)
I had the Chicken Marsala and Bryan had the Eggplant Parmesan and we shared a Chopped Salad. Outside of his entee being a little cold, everything was great. The service was very attentive - and we didnt have room for dessert - so that's always a sure good sign. =0)
Service at Maggiano's always seems to be top notch - well trained and educated staff and very pleasant - always a great choice!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and we had Yuli  as our server. I have to say she was one of the best server we  had in a long time she never stop smiling she never missed a beat. You're very lucky to have her.everything that she recommended was excellent"}
{"text":"Adored the ambiance, waiters and customer service when I had dinner here with family! My favorite dish was their meat lasagna. My least favorite dish was their cheese stuffed ravioli."}
{"text":"The food and service is ALWAYS AMAZING! For this to be a chain, it feels more like a family restaurant! It's usually crowded, but the wait isn't very long. I'm pregnant and the waitress gave me some delicious lemon cookies. That was really sweet!"}
{"text":"I adore Maggianos.. Brett is the best waiter.. Had him 2x..& he's simply the best. He knows the menu.. How to pair wine well.. Reminds me of sommoliers in France.. encourages people like me to get away from the manicotti & try a truffle cream tortellina :-) this has become my splurge every couple of months... A chain without a chain feel.."}
{"text":"Great strip views with perfectly prepared Italian food. I highly recommend the Lobster Carbonara and stuffed mushrooms. Very reasonably priced for the setting, vibe, and quality of food. I like the lobster carbonara here. Rich, decadent, and filling."}
{"text":"Oh My God!  This is the best Italian food I have ever eaten!  Seriously!  This is going to be food that I crave.

I went here last night, to meet my boyfriends son.  So, it was ideal that we meet at a pretty special but \"kid friendly\" (I'd call if more family style) place.  When we got there at 7:00 on a Sunday, we were told there was a 30 minute wait, but a table opened up in the bar and we were able to grab it and be served right away.

I was told the portions were big so I decided to share with my 8 year old.  Much to my delight, I found out there was a selection of the menu where you could mix and match pastas and take a 2nd order home at the end of your meal.  We ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce (my 8 year old's choice) and decided to take the Eggplant parmesean home.  My boyfriend and his son got the lasagna which I tried and it was incredible.  The spaghetti was good and there was a lot leftover even though we shared.

The waitress was great and attentive to our needs even though the place was packed and we were there for over 2 hours just enjoying each others company.  As were were finishing up, one of the cooks came out from the back to visit with a friend that had come in for dinner.  He was short, stocky, bald, jovial, and loud- a real Italian.  No wonder his food is so good!  

The next day, I almost ate the eggplant for breakfast but I controlled myself until about 11:30.  I can't believe how good it was.  Refrigerated overnight and nuked and it was still incredible.  I cant imagine how good it has to be fresh out of the oven.

If Valentine's Day wasn't 3 days away I'd suggest we go back here for dinner.  It is a north Scottsdale restaurant that is comfortable and classy.  Dress up or dress down, it doesn't matter.  It is just comfortable.  

Some things I noticed....  There is valet parking by the front door, but there is plenty of public parking too.  They have take out.  It is a good idea to make a reservation.  Sitting in the bar is just fine vs. a long wait for a table (although I didn't go in the back and see the restaurant.)  They host big parties- weddings, anniversaries, etc.  AND, the coolest thing, they hold cooking classes the last Thursday of the month.  I think I dropped enough (pretty straight forward) hints to my b.f. that I thought it would be a fantastic Thursday date night.  We will see how it goes. :)"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is one of my favorite restaurants. 

Calamari, great
Chopped Salad, great
Caesar Salad, good
Veal Parmesan, great
Beef Medallions, good
Tiramisu, really good

The thing to do is to go to Maggiano's with 4/5 friends shortly after you work out (so you can eat more) qand get a family style dinner. You choose a fixed number of apps, entrees and desserts and they bring you as much as you want until you can't eat anymore. Great deal and we have a lot of fun. My one problem with Maggiano's is that the bread is never warm.

I have read some reviews comparing Maggiano's to other Italian chains. If anyone feels that way then they should continue eating at those chains because maybe their taste buds can't appreciate the difference."}
{"text":"I live in Greenville, SC and my best friend and I decided to take a day trip to Charlotte. We've eaten here before and decided to go for dinner. This was the only time Sunday we ate the same thing. We both got stuffed mushrooms, eggplant parm, and tiramisu. I woke up slightly nauseous but didn't think much of it, my friend however was suffering from terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea. Now I only ate the pasta part of the eggplant parm, the next day almost right after I ate the rest of mine i began suffering from the same symptoms. There was also, when I ate it, a strange rubbery plastic like thing in my tiramisu. It's unlikely I will go back. For almost  $30 a meal I expect food that won't make me sick."}
{"text":"When 8 people can eat dinner with drinks for $50 a head on the Strip, you've got yourself a great deal.

Food is above average - not quite authentic but WAY above Olive Garden.

Service was great, and they were able to seat our party at 6:00 for 8 ppl without a reservation.

Be warned - you will be stuffed!!!"}
{"text":"I was out and about running errands at Beachwood Place, and wandered into Maggianos.   I've eaten here many times.   Today, I was by myself and therefore sat at the bar.  The bartender was personable and very prompt.   I ordered a mojito, italian flatbread pizza and a Maggianos salad.  A few moments later I received a large piece of warm and fluffy foccacia bread and olive oil for dipping (yum).  Shortly thereafter, I received the mojito, which was a little disappointing, it tasted like club soda and rum.  There was a small piece of lime and a small piece of mint, neither was muddled prior to adding to the drink.  I promptly asked for more sugar and lime, which helped, but still didn't taste like a mojito ($8).   The flatbread is one of my favorites and didn't disappoint, nor did the salad.   I will of course return to Maggianos in the very near future, just might not order the mojito."}
{"text":"we ate there just after opening and it was great. More upscale than fashion show and you better get there early cuz it was packed"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and very well run. Always a longer wait on the weekends but we sat at the bar for our wait & had a few drinks. Everyone is very friendly and food is fantastic. Make sure to try the Creme Brule!"}
{"text":"Not my first time...Definitely not my last :)
This is one of my faves...and any excuse to stuff myself with Italian food well what can I say. We went last night for dinner with the kiddos and my parents. The food was great, I had my favorite Rigatoni D I just can't order anything else...I know there is tons of other great stuff I just love this. I ordered the extra pig size hehe so I could have dinner tonight! 
The service was OK but it is never exceptional! The waiter was knowledgeable but was pushing the dinner special with SO much food it would feed a small country. Other than that though it was awesome...
My biggest criticism though every time I go there we get stuck in a seating area where we are attached to a pole...I mean why is that? I end up talking to the big brown square tower it is so annoying! Oh well sometimes that makes for better conversation than my husband :)"}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native I was thrilled to hear there was a location near me in Arizona, so much so that I actually booked my wedding night dinner here! The service at this location was superb from the hostess to servers and valet. Their meals are prepared with quality in mind. This location is easy to find and has a great variety of seating upstairs, downstairs, and at the bar area. You can't go wrong with their buy one take one home deals on pasta. I will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Had my wedding rehearsal dinner here back in April and was great! Tried to go tonight at 5 and was told it would be a 45 minute wait. We decided to have drinks at the bar and wait it out. At 6 we asked how long our wait would be and they said they were slotted for right at that moment but that they were 10-15 minutes behind. Went up again at 6:50 and was told that there were SIX parties still ahead of us  and that they couldn't say how much longer it would be. Incredibly disappointed in their ability to seat and move traffic lately considering we have had so many good experiences in the past. Will not be recommending this location for here on!"}
{"text":"Coming from Beverly Hills, this restaurant felt like home; perhaps even better. Service was way beyond expected, food was better than some restaurants in South Beverly Drive, staff was the best, and management was top notch. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. Thanks for the great night!"}
{"text":"Overall, Maggiano's in Summerlin was a decent experience.  Service was good.  The stuffed mushrooms had almost no flavor.  The truffle tortellacci tasted good, nice cheesy sauce, but ZERO truffle flavor.  The braised beef pappardelle had little flavor, but was still enjoyable.  The bread was excellent.  We wouldn't object if friends suggested going there, but we wouldn't go on our own."}
{"text":"OMG!! The food at Maggiano's is awesome! Went over the weekend and way over ordered. The eggplant is fantastic."}
{"text":"Lovely patio location with good view of the strip and shopping area. The patio is support pet friendly which is a perk (they even brought some water for my dog), and the service is excellent. Lunch food is great - I dined on a salad that had basil, peppers and mozzarella with a sweet balsamic dressing and the complimentary bread was freshly baked. The house Pinot Grigio is great as well!"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner of 17 people and do not have a single complaint about anything. Originally,  we were to be in the dining room,  but they called to let us know they were moving us upstairs to a private room, at no extra cost. We had the Family Style menu, and I made the selections ahead of time. When we arrived, we were escorted upstairs to a table set for us with printed menus waiting so everyone knew what to expect. Service was wonderful. We were greeted by Alisa, and she introduced our 2 servers. Everyone was very attentive making sure we had everything we need. The food was delicious. We had 6 children,  and they all had 2 plate fulls, eating all they selected. As it was my son's Birthday,  Alisa sent him home with a special dessert in addition to what we had at dinner. A Perfect Evening!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes were out of this world.  Perfectly cooked and presented with a small salad, just the perfect amount of food for a lunch or early dinner.  The Lemon Drop cocktails were equally delicious.  Service--A+"}
{"text":"Upon our recent visit to Fort Mill, SC to spend some time with family, one of our meals included Maggiano's after a day at the mall.

We ordered the 'Classic' family style, and it was delicious!  We don't have anything like that here in Hawaii, so it was a nice treat!

We ended up ordering Caesar & Maggiano's salads, stuffed mushrooms & calamari,  baked ziti, eggplant parmesan,  chicken parmesan, & chicken picatta.  For dessert, Nonna's toasted pound cake, & the apple crostada.

My husband and I have the age old problem of filling up on appetizers & salad, especially since they refill your bowls when you run out!  The stuffed mushrooms were the best I've ever had, & Cesar salad is awesome anytime of the day.  By the time the entrees came we were semi full but I loved the eggplant parmesan!  

We did not feel rushed at all to hurry up and leave, we spent almost 3hrs at dinner that night.   Our table was celebrating a number of occasions, our first wedding anniversary, a college graduation & a birthday.  Our waiter gave us complementary lemon cookies for the road (but after we blew out candles!).  

We most definitely look forward to return when we visit our family again on the East Coast!"}
{"text":"I'm not one of those \"chain\" people. I might even be on my high horse a bit about always making an effort when possible to eat local. However, when given the opportunity to enjoy a free lunch with my office I will close my mouth around some free food. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was impeccable. Gracious, without checking in too often.

I'm not sure how long the buy one famous pasta entree get another one free (FREE!) pasta deal will last but I've heard that its been around for awhile. You can enjoy lasagna for lunch and take home ravioli, or eggplant parm or spaghetti or any other pasta of your choosing. They don't even make you feel cheap for ordering a BOGO special (like everyone at my table did). Our waiter even brought us complimentary delicious lemon cookies since we were celebrating."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will not be the last! Amazing food and amazing service. The chef heard it was our first time dining here and sent us out some fresh tomato bruschetta!!! Ordered the pesto pasta dish and for dessert tiramisu and carrot cake - beyond delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. We went there for our wedding rehearsal dinner a few months ago. Everyone had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, chicken florentine was delicious. Nice atmosphere,  right off the strip. I'll go back to this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Nice view from 2nd floor. Good food especially the chopped salad and simple pasta with sausage. Not too expensive considering Vegas prices."}
{"text":"Notice the four stars, but this started out as a bad experience that was made good:  a sign of an excellent establishment with management that is on top of things and is dedicated to making things right.

We went for lunch.  It was uncrowded, not more than 8 tables of people.  In fact, there were excess staff hovering about and the wait staff maybe had 2 tables each at any one time.  A very quiet lunch period.

There is a special lunch menu and we both ordered to the skirt steak with fries and side salad, along with a side of sauteed spinach.  Simple, eh?

Well, we waited and waited.  Joseph, our server told us twice that our order was coming.  Meanwhile we overheard two other servers apologizing to their table for the delay and then Joseph came by to apologize.  I commented, lightly, \"Well I guess the kitchen is overwhelmed by the crowd today?\"

After 40 minutes we received our order along with more apologies, but it was Anessa the manager delivering our order.  Very nice lady and she was very generous in comping some of our order so it turned out fine.

The servers did nothing wrong and it was only the kitchen, so if this happens to you, bring in the big guns by asking for the manager.  Maggiano's selects, trains and retains some of the best managers around and those managers, along with the business itself has a very low tolerance for screw-ups.  They, even more so than you, want things to be perfect.

As usual, food was excellent, portions just shy of gigantic, clean facility and sincere servers.  If you have not had a Maggiano's experience...get in there.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a beautiful view of the strip! The food is very rich, so I got full pretty quickly. The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the location on the strip, so I wanted to try it out in Downtown Summerlin. Great service and food from both locations! I came here the other night and my pasta is delicious. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. She refilled our drinks quickly and the food came out in no time (even though it was pretty busy). I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  Great food, cocktails, ambience, and view of all the city lights at night.  It's located on the 2nd floor of the Fashion mall across from Trump Towers.  I had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob-type pieces with chicken meatballs and chopped peppers, onions, and quartered potatoes. The hubs had chicken Parmesan that came with a side of spaghetti.  Everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads.  Great Mojitos & vodka martinis. The buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah-mazing.  We rolled out of their we were so full.  The place was hopping even at 8:30 pm."}
{"text":"Table service was exceptional. Drinks always tended on time. Manager present on floor ensuring guest satisfactions were met. Food portions are large and priced at reasonable rates. Save room for their fantastic deserts as well. Great value here."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a lot of American style Italian food in huge portions made by the same people who own Chili's and Macaroni Grill.  The food is mostly less than average except for the appetizers.  The fried zucchini are large flat pieces with delicious light and crispy breading.  The pasta itself is overall a bit blah, and pasta I make at home generally tastes better than most pasta I've had here.

The place is huge and the service is good, so it is definitely a decent place for large groups.  They also have some killer deals if you're frugal.  If you order any of their \"homestyle\" pastas, you can another to take home for free.  They also have a dinner for two deal where you can get two pastas, two to take home, two salads, an appetizer, and a dessert for $40.  

I've never gone to Maggiano's on my own accord and most likely wouldn't.  But it's a decent place for groups to go and have a good time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . Really nice tasty different beers . Had that Marco deal and it was Really nice . Luv that place . Ohh and also nice view if u chose to set outside ."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of colleagues and clients. The staff managed our fluid numbers well (we had some come and some go) and were not flustered at all.
We had so much food we couldn't do it all - I think it was one of the set menus here basically the food just keeps coming. We had beef medallions, lasagne, salads, pasta, the works, all very tasty, well prepared and served promptly and hot! 
Can't fault it, have been here several times in Vegas and highly recommend it for a casual meal."}
{"text":"The flatbread was delicious and the pasta alfredo with chicken and shirmp mmmm, the price was right!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone thought the food was good...  The waitress was not suited for this venue and was overwhelmed by the size of our party (eight in all).  We waited a long time for everything and 1 of our appetizers didn't make it until after the main course was served.  Water glasses, beer glasses left unfilled.  WE asked for a second basket of bread and cheese for the pasta at least 3 times.  Used plates were left on the table and we had to ask to have them removed as they were serving the main dishes.  A glass of wine was spilled on my friend next to me ( by the waitress ) .   By the time our meal was complete and we were heading out the door, over 2 hours had passed.  It took the manager at least half an hour to make it to our table to talk to the wine wearing customer.  They did replace her meal (which she had them make it to go) .  When she got her check they had removed the cost of the meal and gave her a card to have her garments cleaned.  Anyway,  zero complaints about the food or the price for that matter.  But, everything else just made it  not so enjoyable."}
{"text":"Just another chain restaurant Caesar salad and the food server at the table dropped the balsamic oil which splattered on my new shoes!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but wasn't impressed. It took over an hour to get our dinner. Had simple fettuccini Alfredo w chicken. It had decent taste but the sauce had the consistency of soup. It was so runny I could not eat it w my fork. The only place I saw the chicken was on my bill! On a good note the bread was good! 
Sadly this will make my list of the \"one and done\"."}
{"text":"I had gnocchi with meat sauce, huge portion but Very good. then the best part was that I got a free pasta to take home. So I got 3 meals for the price of 1. That makes everything better. I took moms lasagna home with me and it oo was very good."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience dining in at your restaurant. The food, service and atmosphere is perfect! I used the carry out service today and ordered online. I rec'd the same excellent service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Decent food, family type restaurant. Dining room is jam-packed - a bit snug, elbow to elbow. Meal was fine but nothing to rave about; server seemed very nice but just awful. Very slow and inattentive. Not sure why this place is super popular when it's only so-so."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Restaurant.  Dimly lit for the romantics. Loved the red and white checkered tablecloths 
Large portions of food. When you purchase a traditional pasta dinner you get a 2nd dinner to take home..compliments of the chef.  Lasagna was hearty and seasoned well.  Winding staircase to the banquet rooms and the restrooms. After dinner stroll over to SAKS for a little shopping. Service was fast and our sever was attentative and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Jake our server, on point, never had to request anything! Made great wine recommendations and was very personable. THE best ever butter cake with a Caramelized exterior, moist and soft interior, with ice cream...wow! Thank you to Chef Deidre for that! Steven the manager was so kind and attentive with my praises to the team. Very friendly too. Jake, we'll be requesting you by name! Ask for Jake y'all for the best service!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Love the atmosphere and the decor. The portions are generous,  you can literally split one plate with 2 people. We come here often since the other location is the the strip and if we can avoid the strip, we will."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants! Besides the fact that it's around the corner from our office, it's great for a business meeting lunch, family meal, date night, private dining (I had a BIG birthday party there) and Happy Hour too! Excellent food, excellent service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Best Long islands! Mattaius was amazing and Angela had the best recommendations, bruschetta platter was delicious. We love the Maggianos salad, excellent flavor sort of sweet mixed with blue cheese and prosciutto. Highly recommend the new peach dessert. Wish they served lunch. Although they do have weekend brunch until 3 PM on Saturday and Sunday"}
{"text":"We like Maggiano's and this location is no different.  We were greeted with a warm welcome and the food is always pretty consistent.  This is one of our \"go to\" places.  It's fast, affordable and great for our kiddo."}
{"text":"My mom and I dined here on a Monday evening and I must say I was very impressed. Our server was impeccable...I wish I could remember his name but he was a gem. I had the chicken piccata and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend that dish if you go. My mom had the gnocchi and sausage dish and it was also amazing. Probably the best gnocchi I've ever tried. The bread is good also that they bring to the table and since it was our first time there they brought a little sample of their bruschetta to try and it was yummy. I really enjoyed the atmosphere...lots of cozy booths and soft music playing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday here with several people on a Monday night. Everyone's food was excellent especially the calamari app. Service was decent. It was a good night with great food."}
{"text":"Looove this place! Came here with my coworkers and bestie for the Baker to Vegas annual run in 2011.  We sat on the balcony and the weather was perfect. I ordered a seafood pasta dish, i think it's called Linguine di Mare and tiramisu for dessert. Boy, everything was delicious especially the tiramisu!!! Service was great and it's located at the Fashion Show Mall (my other favorite place to visit while in Vegas).  

I also came back here this year, 2012, for lunch but the wait was too long and I was too hungry so I went downstairs to this Mexican spot.  I'll probably try the one in Orlando, Florida this week and the one on Santana Row in San Jose soon. I'll keep ya posted on each visit. Toddles, Yelpers! Try this spot and sit outside!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good services 
Nice host we ever had
Big portions of food
We can't finish and took lots food home

{"text":"It is very sad to say that my husband and I visited your establishment yesterday for his birthday based on reviews and I must admit, disappointment is an understatement. We arrived there and waited 15 minutes before anyone ever came to the table to even give us some water! There was a party who arrived about 10 minutes after us who not only had their water waiting but they then had their bread served and order being taken while we just waited. Yes, the food was great and the drinks but service overpowers everything and the service was HORRIBLE! I asked for a manager and they told me he was not available and gave me a website to contact cooperate. Sad. $70 down the drain. We took our food to go after it came out as it took over an hr! I hope someone reads this!"}
{"text":"This review is for carryout which used to be decent when you could order online. Now you have to call it in and accuracy was atrocious. I got a box of lemon cookies for all the mistakes instead of getting items comp'd.  I am not one to complain but thought I'd let others know not to waste your money. In addition, food was sub-par and mediocre at best. I would definitely not recommend this and would consider it above Olive Garden in quality."}
{"text":"Had dinner here.  Great pasta, good service.  

Ordered the Chicken Marsala.  Very good.  Came with three well-sized pieces of chicken with mushrooms over the marsala sauce.   However, what surprised me was how freaking good the noodles on the side were.  I don't know what made them so addicting and delicious but they were.   Our server stated it was just simply seasoned with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.   It tasted really good and I wish I asked for more.

Having kids also has its perks.  From the kid's menu, we ordered the lasagna.   The portion was enough to feed a family.   Lots of meat.  Very filling and we liked it alot.

Didn't care much for the soup I added to our meal.  Tuscan-something, I forget the name right now.  But it had beans in it.   Won't order it next time.

I think you have to ask for the complimentary bread though before they bring it out.  My server didn't mention it until I mentioned bread.  Maybe it's so you can possibly order other appetizers.  Great for lunch or dinner whenever you're around Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Vegas, it was late night. We just want to have something simply, not too oily or heavy, and then we found this Italian restaurant within 5 minutes walk from Trump. The environment is lovely. There is a violinist playing beautiful songs from table to table. The food were fabulous. We had crab cake for appetizer. The crab was fresh and delicious. I had sauteed shrimps with risotto and it was fantastic. The rice was creamy but not to soft. Shrimp was cooked just enough. My friend has salmon with pasta. It looked nice too."}
{"text":"If you would have asked me a year ago, I probably would have given Maggiano's a little more credit. I don't know if since moving to Cleveland I have been super spoiled with authentic Italian cuisine so easily accessible, but this time around, Maggiano's seemed so much more sub par. 

For starters, the bread seemed to have changed....and not for the better. I remember it being packed with flavor and this time around it was just a plain jane as can be. As an appetizer, I always order the stuffed mushrooms and in the past would leave no crumb behind. However, as soon as the server set them down on the table I noticed something different. I recall them being covered in melted cheese before and I don't know if that step had been overlooked, but they were naked and basic as heck. Not horrible, though. 

Since my last visit, I did notice they added \"light\" versions of the classic dishes to the menu, which is a job very well done. I ordered the light chicken piccata and while the fattier version is obviously more tasty, it was a nice spin on my favorite dish and almost half the calories! I love that they list the calories next to each entree. My fiancee ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which was good but would be really sad if they messed up that!

Now for the deal breaker---to put it nicely, the food did NOT agree with either of us. I don't want to be too graphic but you get my drift. Not one but both of us??? Kind of strange. I doubt we will be back, but then again when shopping I tend to work up an appetite and being perfectly placed inside Beachwood Place, they definitely have that going for them."}
{"text":"Been hear once before., it was good. Went again yesterday around 4pm for lunch/dinner. For the record I had toast for breakfast and nothing else till I ordered. Place is very nice and the staff is friendly, but NOT eating their again! Ordered the Balsamic grilled salmon with the side mashed potatoes and a coke. All I ate was bread and the grilled fish. Mashed potatoes were not that good. Woke up at midnight and spent a couple of hours in the BATHROOM! Yes all the symptoms of food poisoning, ALL! Did not expect that from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.   

Everyone had something different....
Ck. Francaise, ck pesto, penne a la vodka,  meat calls sms salad, peach tea was good also. 

Food was cooked properly and delicious

The waiter was very attentive.  Not expensive.....

Definetly go!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible! It was way over priced for the amount of food you got. The food tasted fine, but for what you pay, you think you would get more. Too pricey."}
{"text":"There's either one of two, or both type of people giving bad reviews about this place and that's one: a liberal or two: an elderly person who nit picks everything.  So don't listen to these elders or liberals on here because my wife and I had an amazing time.  The food was beyond phenomenal I got the spaghetti and meatball and the mrs had stuffed ravioli.  For desert we got the cheese cake and tiramisu, both amazing but the tiramisu was like gold sliding down your throat.  Hands down the best tiramisu we both have ever had, you gotta try this restaurant and you definitely have to try the tiramisu."}
{"text":"This is a great italian place, it's a lot of fun when you go here with a big group of people.
I've been to this location plenty of times, and I think I visited the location in scottsdale, az as well.  The service is great and the servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday a couple of days ago and really enjoyed it. The bread came out fast and was so good because it is handmade in the restaurant! It was nice not having to starve while waiting for our appetizer and entrees. 

Also the customer service was great! Even though he was waiting more tables he was very attentive and courteous. 

The food came out hot and fast and tasted great! We couldn't finish our pasta because we were so stuffed! They have large portions and my pasta was only 15 dollars! About the same price as Olive Garden but it was actually delicious. Believe it or not, our total was cheaper than the time we went to Olive Garden! 

From the time we arrived to the time we left it was only 40 mins! So I'd say service was extremely fast, especially since they were busy that night. I will go again if I'm in the mood for Italian (:"}
{"text":"We had an exceptional family birthday dinner celebration at Maggiano's last night.  The food was wonderful and plentiful and the service was amazing. We ordered family style. The food just kept on coming and coming.  I especially enjoyed the fresh mozzarella for the brushetta. The chocolate cake was so worth the calories.  This is the perfect place for a celebration.  Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been to Maggiano's two times. They have some tables that are right next to a window that has a really great view of the strip which I liked. Most people want to sit there so there is a wait time that can be pretty long. I ordered the chicken parm. And it was really good. They also give you a lot of food which a lot of restaurants don't do anymore. Its a very nice restaurant and will deff. be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I typically do not celebrate Valentine's day, but this year we decided to get dressed up and make dinner reservations on Valentine's day; with as busy as it was, we only had to wait about 10 minutes before being seated. Yes, we did have a reservation, but being Valentine's night I would have been surprised if we had been seated immediately. \"Marco's meal for two\" is the best deal on their menu, so that's what we ordered, and we both got side salads, entrees, a dessert to split, and an entrée each to take home! The spinach salad was fantastic- and even though it came dressed, it was not too heavy. It was also larger than I expected for a side salad. For dinner I ordered the lighter take ziti- YUM. Our entrees came out about 10 minutes after we got our salads, and our waitress actually apologized for it, saying that they had been taking much longer earlier in the evening. Well, I'd rather get my entrée quicker than have to wait ages for it. our waitress that night was attentive but not hovering, and she really seemed to enjoy being there. Nonna's pound cake for dessert was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Overall, I was especially impressed with Maggiano's on Valentine's night, and it will be hard to pick another restaurant the next time we want to go out.

Side note, the last time we went to Maggiano's the kitchen was a little slow and we ended up being comped an appetizer for the wait. I appreciate service like that."}
{"text":"On Saturday evening October 7th we called in to make a reservation the lady on the call informed us there's a two hour wait and put our name on the wait list for 9pm. We got here all the way from north Charlotte to have a peaceful diner. We made there to find out there's been no reservation on our name. We showed her the call log which after looking as well they refused to accept us. Pathetic management, the simplest thing they could do put us on the log, that too they failed to do. On the contrary the lady at the front desk didn't even make any efforts to make it work she just said I'll have to put you on  the waitlist again. I would never come back here and wouldn't recommend to anyone. You guys disappointed us."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place just because it's such a hassle going to the one on the strip.

Food of course was still great. But what made the experience much better was our service, Jennifer.

She was very kind to me and my daughter. Answered our questions and accommodated our requests. She was really good that even my 6 year old mentioned that she was really nice person. 

More than the food, it was a Jennifer's attention to us that would make us go to this restaurant over the other one.

On a final note: the Spinach Salad is the best I have had. And my all time favorite dessert is still the Apple Crostada."}
{"text":"I love going here. The food always tastes good. The atmosphere is great. I especially love their mussels in Diavolo sauce. So yummy. I just wish their portions were as big as before. Their prices are a tad more expensive and the portions get smaller. The quality is still there but the quantity is"}
{"text":"Our server Daniel was very polite and pleasant.  Despite me not caring for my original main course selection, the assistant GM Karna Patel really showed his professionalism by personally coming out immediately to make sure our table was content. Our group works in different high end dealerships. We know excellent customer service and satisfaction when we see it.  Receiving that type of care whether or not the food was perfect or not makes a big difference. Daniel is a true asset to this establishment. We wish him much success in his career here.  On a different note, their stuffed mushrooms were perfectly cooked.  The Chicken Parmesan was very succulent and perfectly seasoned.  And the butter cake is to die for.  Definitely coming back in the future.

{"text":"My first time here exceeded my expectations.  I made reservation since it was a Saturday & I figured they would be busy. We got there 30 minutes & went to the bar while we waited. Our table was ready before we got our glasses of wine so that was already a nice surprise. Maggie was our server and she was super sweet and very attentive to our table for as busy as the restaurant was. We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip for appetizer. Their menu has so many great choices but I got the shrimp scampi. I could rave about that, but for dessert I ordered the Gigi Butter Cake. It was absolutely amazing! Save room for the butter cake if you can or take it home because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. We had a reservation for 9 pm but we got there at about 8:15 because we forgot that the mall was closed so we checked ourselves in and got a table within ten minutes! Although the tables are close together, we did not feel crowded. We got the Marco's Meal for Two which is an appetizer (or flatbread or two salads), two entrees (choose from the classic pastas or get the lasagna, four cheese ravioli or mushroom ravioli for an extra $2), a dessert, and two meals to take home for only $40! We got the spinach and artichoke dip, the both of us ordered the mushroom ravioli, and we ended it with the warm apple crostata. Everything was delicious! My advice is not get a cheesy, creamy appetizer and entree together. Though they were both delicious, it was a bit much. Next time we'll go for the bruschetta appetizer or an entree with red sauce. The service was also very nice. Our server was attentive and very sweet. We have no complaints about the food, service, or atmosphere! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's has been a favorite of ours for some time now. The food and service has always been consistently good. Over the last few years we have eaten here several times and never been disappointed. The price is right around average for mainstream american chains such as cheesecake factory but the quality is a bit better than most in this category. While this is no gourmet celebrity chef italian restaurant, it doesn't really pretend to be. It does what it sets out to do - provide quality, value, and a nice atmosphere for families looking to enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"I've always loved maggianos and was ecstatic to find it was still open at 10:30pm yesterday. The waitress wanted to know if we wanted our dishes spicy and I said sure, a little.

When our plates come out, it was literally covered with crashed red pepper. My mouth was burning and it was completely inedible. I had to pour water over my food to wash some of the crushed red pepper off. The waitress never stopped by to ask how things were.

The other dish also drowned in crushed red pepper was seafood and definitely not fresh, nor was the sauce. 

Okay, they were closing in an hour,but if I'm paying full price for food, I expect fresh food not drowned in pepper to mask old seafood.

$60 wasted and had to pay for another meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was here again last night and both the service and the food were amazing. The waiter so so kind and had perfect timing on drinks, bread, etc. I think my experience written up in the last review was likely just an off-night for the restaurant or server.

Last night was a totally different experience and it was the dinner rush, we stopped in at 7:30PM. 

I ordered the carbonara with chicken instead of lobster -- just not a fan of seafood and pasta -- and it was amazingly delicious. 

I also really love their bread and butter. The bread is soft and fresh and the butter is room temperature (it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when butter is served cold). 

Yummy Italian food!"}
{"text":"Last visit here was overly disappointing. Our server was an older woman with short black hair and we were ignored the whole time. Never asked if we'd like anything to drink. We did the dinner for 2, she never asked us what we wanted for our take home entrees, never asked us what we wanted for dessert. She completely ignored us. I had to get the busser to help is who was great. He got out to go meals and our dessert, but our server was absolutely terrible. She attended to other tables, but maybe since my boyfriend and I are younger she didn't pay us the proper attention? Her mistake because I tip 20% every time. Anyways, this was like a twilight zone restaurant experience and considering it was for our anniversary dinner this was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Today, I was here for lunch with a group of about 15 people or so for an event. The private room was reserved for us and the organizer had a menu selected for us that was displayed on the table. The table was set up nicely and the room still had Christmas decoration which was beautiful and very tasteful. There were. Bread baskets and butter on the table too. 

As soon as our whole group was there, we received a complementary appetizer from the restaurant. We thought that was very nice. A little later, our pre-selected dishes started to get served. We had salad, and fried cheese as well as bruschetta. I tried the salad and the bruschetta and they were both very good. I liked how the salad was really well seasoned and the dressing was delicious, just the way I like my salad. 

Our main dishes were 4, salmon, rigatoni, chicken parm and the 4-cheese ravioli. I only tried the salmon and the 4 cheese ravioli. The salmon was slightly on the dry side but it had a good flavor. The 4-cheese ravioli was delicious! I kept having more and more of it! The ravioli seemed to be made fresh and the cheeses inside and the sauce had excellent flavor. 

We concluded our lovely meal with cheese cakes, cookies, and vanilla ice cream with fruits for me only because of my egg sensitivity. This was a nice gesture from he restaurant to accommodate me. 

Overall service was excellent and good was very good. The music playing in the background was one of my favorite, easy listening genre, mostly Frank Sinatra. I have no idea what the prices were like because we were invited so I am unable to comment on prices but having reviewed the menu yesterday, the restaurant can be considered on the more expensive side. 

Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Las Vegas twice or three times a year and always grab a cocktail or two at Maggiano's.

i am really glad to see that the owner realized to re-implement the best happy hour on the Las Vegas strip. For some reason they decided to stop this in May. But given the state of the economy, this was the best thing Maggiano's could do.

I will always continue to come here and recommend it to my friends.

Keep doing what you are doing."}
{"text":"Beautiful, classy restaurant with excellent food and fair prices. What's not to like? Servers are super friendly, they have a killer \"buy one take one home\" pasta deal, and if you join their e-club you get 10 bucks off your bill. It's a great place for a big family meal or a nice date as well. The stuffed mushrooms are fantastic!  Not sure if I even chewed, I just inhaled them. I was also stoked about the chicken saltimbocca.  Needed a little salt but very flavorful. Italian food is my weakness, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"You're gonna get faaaatttt.....(yup the food's that delish you wont be able to stop)

Ate lunch here on a Weds, came back for dinner on Thursday.

Great dishes, you cant go wrong with anything (except for maybe the Lobster ravioli, you only get 4!).

HUUUUGE helpings so you'll definitely have some left to take home.  Lasagna is great, spaghetti and meatballs were outta sight (i'm a picky meatball kinda gal), and the tiramisu knocked it outta the park.  

Thank god they have one in Costa Mesa, CA - although a trip to Vegas would not be complete without stopping here.

PS - Make reservations.  Wait time is long but worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the veal Parmesan Marsala. Great red wine. I love the atmosphere and service. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. This has been the best Italian food I've had...ever! Spaghetti with meatballs was amazing but the dessert! Nanno's pound cake! TO DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at this festive South Park Mall restaurant often over the past 15 years and have never left disappointed (nor hungry.) Everything is made from scratch and is delicious. Prices are surprisingly affordable for such an an affluent area of South Charlotte. They are famous for their huge serving sizes and reliable service. Great, casual atmosphere.

It has proven impossible for us not to order to Marco's Meal for Two for $42.95. It's a super deal and includes two salads, four pasta dishes and a desert. It always provides enough food for two to three meals.

All of their salads are special and plentiful. We went with the Maggiano's and the Chopped this time (but have tried them all.) Both, as usual, were excellent - fresh lettuce and bacon with flavorful dressings. Fresh baked bread is included and don't be shy in asking for a fresh loaf to take home with your leftovers (which you'll surely have.)

Our four pasta dishes included the Baked Ziti, Eggplant Parmesean, Four Cheese Ravioli and Lasagna. Everything was good but the ravioli was the star! Perfect texture and savory sauce.

Finished off with the tiramisu but have, again, tried them all. There are no duds here. Most run $7.95 regular price and are enough for two. We added a cappuccino for a reasonable $3.95 and waddled to the car with a smile.

This place is a Gotta Try!"}
{"text":"Pros: nice server and good food. 

Cons: where to begin. I made the reservation for a special occasion a month ago for 16 people and was even confirmed two days prior for 7:45 PM. Our party arrives before 7:45 PM only to be told the tables not ready yet. 30 minutes later we're taken to a table that only seats 10. We go back to the hostess stand where there is no where to sit or stand which only causes us to be in the way. Finally 20 minutes later were seated. 20 minutes after that we're still waiting on meeting our server and getting any drink orders in. Luckily about 10 minutes after having to speak to a manager for about the fourth time that night we finally got water. Unfortunately not everyone got their drink order but just getting the water was a success after a terrible 45 min to hour of waiting. The food was really good and we were able to end on a good note. Unfortunately I don't see myself or anyone else in my party coming back especially with a large group. Their \"thing\" is large parties and especially around the holidays you'd think they could accompany 12-16 people but clearly that wasn't the case. And not to mention there was no comps or apologies for a terrible experience.  It was too bad that we had to have such a terrible start with no one really seeming to care."}
{"text":"The entire experience was excellent. Our server Liz was very welcoming & attentive. I had the egg plant parmigiana. It was perfect.  The best I ever had thus far. My husband had the shrimp scampi and he loved it. We celebrated my birthday and Liz brought over a delicious cheese cake with lemon cookies. It was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, great food and drinks. They did get our to-go order wrong and we didn't notice until we got home, but we'll forgive them considering how well the rest of the visit went ;)"}
{"text":"Had a gift card, which is what brought us in. Place was packed. Huge line. That's what we get for coming during barett Jackson though. Sat at the bar. Quick solution to a long wait for a table. Friendly bartender. He was patient with all of our sessions and kept my glass full. Gnocchi was good. Girlfriend had the Lobster Carbonara. She loved it. Great food, just a little \"chain\" style  for my italian taste buds....."}
{"text":"My grandmother and I visited this location. The chicken parm was delicious and the eggplant was pretty good as well. Server was very pushy with the $10.95 cannoli cake and didn't inform us that it was enough for 4 people to share. Not a fan of it."}
{"text":"We had visited on Thanksgiving in the past and the food had been excellent. This time, however, it was quite the opposite. The turkey was dry and had no taste. The stuffing was also dry and frankly inedible. The ham was tough. The mashed potatoes were crunchy? I don't know what that was about. The three cheese ravioli was good & the baked ziti was just OK. We weren't too thrilled with the cheese cake & the tiramisu either. They were at best just OK. This was the consensus of the entire table. We took the chopped salad home which was very good at the restaurant but when we had it later that evening it had turned to pretty much turned to mush in just a few hours in the frig. Do you use metal or plastic utensils to chop the vegetables? If you're using metal utensils consider changing to plastic so the vegetables stay fresher longer. One bright spot was the service which was excellent. Unfortunately, based on quality of the food we will not be going back. It's a shame because we really liked Maggiano's but we spent over $200 on this meal (not including drinks) & we're not thinking this was just a \"one off\" when there were multiple dishes that were subpar."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner, food is always good, large portions, tasty desserts, great wine selections and more! Sign up for their newsletter emails and you'll receive coupons for $10 off. 
Plus twice I've signed my child up for the kids cooking class, they love it and the ticket prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy! I went for dinner and there was a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad. There's not much of a waiting area which sucks because it feels like you're always in the way. Once we were seated it was more of the same. The tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me. For that reason i had to remove one star. However everything else was superb! I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious. In fact I'm making myself hungry just thinking about it! I also had a Caramel apple martini which was delicious! I had to get another. By the end of the meal my belly was full and my body was tipsy. I'd say that's a perfect way to end the day! :-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!!!

My party of 5 were assisted by a woman named \"Heather\" she was very accommodating and friendly! 

Bread bowl never empty, and iced water never dry! 

Our food was good."}
{"text":"My favorite chain restaurant ever! Upscale chain restaurant with consistently delicious food! Clean restaurant, free parking, vast menu options, very large portion sizes, can't go wrong! My all time favorite is the four cheese ravioli made with pesto alfredo sauce--it's so good!! The taylor street baked ziti is my second favorite, and maggianos has the buy one, take one home for free deal going on at all times!!

Our server, Paulo, and the bus boys were all very nice! I highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Good Italian even for a Chain

Out shoping a couple of weeks ago and my wife wanted to go to Maggiano's which is one of her favorite restaurants.  It's very good and is very hign on my list as well.

It's to the right on the South Entrance to South Park so not hard to find.  Walked in and were promptly seated, menu's presented and subsequent orders taken a couple of minutes later.

My wife ordered the Veal Piccate while I opted for the Parmesan Pork. Both were excellent and I would recommend to anyone.

Service was great and as for the atmosphere, as far as Chains go, very good.  Southpark Clientel tends to try and present itself as upscale and this one, does just that.

It's a very good dinning experience."}

{"text":"Excellent service and food. 

Arrived with a reservation. Requested the outside area. Seated promptly. Received complimentary bread. Our server was on point. We ordered calamari and mozzarella for appetites. Both was great. Main dishes was Famous D Rigatoni and alfredo fettuccine. Good. The alfredo was plain though. Just noodle. No pieces of chicken in it. The gf didn't like it as much. Price is much cheaper then on the strip restaurants. Bill came out to $62. For some reason the ice water was so good. Haha"}

{"text":"Went there for a big lunch....first time here! My rating of four stars....borders on a five star rating! We were quickly seated by a very personable hostess, who asked us if we have ever been to Maggiano's before...after saying this was our first time, the server bought out a delicious complimentary pasta dish!  Warm, crusty delicious bread was placed on the table within minutes, and dipped in olive oil made it taste so much better! My wife loved her dish of parmesan crusted tilapia, and the portion was enough for two people! The Maggiano's house salad was very good. My dish of Chicken Marsala was excellent, with plenty of sauce, and small, whole button mushrooms. The service could not have been any more attentive! You won't leave hungry! I just wish there was a Maggiano's closer to where we live in South Gilbert!"}
{"text":"What an amazing birthday dinner at Maggianos. 

Maggianos is beautifully located  within Fashion Show Mall on the Strip, so just with that alone you know the views are amazing, directly facing the Wynn hotels light show and tons of people watching. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and open arms, we were immediately shown to are seats. Next came are server he was great and I am sad I can't remember his name but if it's anything to anyone he did his job great and made sure I had the wine list right in front of me, so three glasses of Riesling later, I am unsure of his name. My husband and I started our meals off with  the bruschetta bar appetizers. Here were the offerings we had two of everything. 

Candied Nueske Bacon, Ricotta, Arugula & Fig Jam2.95Per PieceTomato, Balsamic & Garlic1.95Per PieceSpiced Shrimp, Bacon, Roasted Peppers & Corn Fondue2.95Per PieceRoasted Pear, Prosciutto, Blue Cheese & Balsamic1.95Per Piece
Strawberry Chutney, Orange Fondue & Prosciutto
1.95Per Piece

Then for our main course he had the 
Angel Hair Vegetable Primavera, My husbands plate came out large and bold full of flavor he really enjoyed the purple cauliflower that came with the meal.
Cauliflower, Zucchini, Squash, Carrots, Marinara, Cheese Blend, with Garlic Butter13.95
For my main course I ordered 
Four-Cheese RavioliPesto Alfredo Sauce15.95

My plate came out piping hot!! I was a little nervous about the color of my meal but then did a quick sniff test and realized that it's the Pesto duh!!! And I loved the fact that my pasta was not only boiled but oven baked as well to create that amazing top of cheese burn...  it was great.
This place is really a nice place for a beautiful dinner really happy I had the opportunity to enjoy.  As you can see the prices are great so don't pass this place up it won't kill your pocket book. 

Hint: Ask for fresh shaved parm, they have it in the back"}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing food experience. The waitress was friendly. The restaurant was clean and nice. 
I had the braised beef and Italian sausage. It was out of this world. My wife and daughter got the dinner for two. They got to pick a pasta each, and one to take home. LOTS OF FOOD!!!
I can't wait to go back again. Great experience!!!!/"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to see an affordable Italian joint in Las Vegas strip. Their lasagna was very good. I'm usually quite picky with lasagna too as I had amazing lasagna on my trip to Italy. This one at Maggiano did a pretty good job at an authentic lasagna. Definitely recommend ordering this one here. Price was pretty decent too as it only cost about $11-$12. Luckily even though this is a franchise, food was very authentic and it certainly didn't feel like eating at a franchise.

My friend ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which was amazing. It was breaded chicken stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. The angel hair pasta was in house made and it was cooked perfectly. 

The portions were very generous so we didn't get a chance to try the desserts but definitely would be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience. Atmosphere, ambiance, quality of food. A little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's after looking for 4 stars.  Firstly the good points of the place.  The atmosphere and the location is too good..  Service is too fast,  would say unexpectedly fast.. The prices are reasonable for a Italian restaurant..  The waiter were friendly and the services were really good.  
All the above can be enjoyed best when your taste buds are really pleasured. The food I would say is average, or below average than what the location demands. Their is a room for improvement."}
{"text":"For a great Italian meal and an affordable price on the strip, this is the place.  I have come here for a meal every time I am in Vegas for something a little more affordable.  The great thing is the quality of food and service makes you not miss the pricey hotel restaurants.

On my most recent trip, my wife and I made reservations early afternoon for that night.  Our past couple of visits without reservations we had to wait for a table once we got to the restaurant.  This time we were seated right away.  The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday night, but not as busy as we had seen it before.  My wife got the Chicken Parmesan, which is a classic and delicious. I got the mushroom ravioli, which were also quite delicious.

The service was exceptional.  Our food arrived quickly and our waiter was friendly and helpful.  For me, this place is a must on every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"We dined tonight, July 18, 2017, at Magliano's Summerlin for the first time and were totally impressed.  Our server, Dina, was warm and friendly, and helpful with the menu.  She must have tried every item for all her knowledge.  Our food arrived timely and as busy as Dina was, she checked up on us frequently to be sure we loved our food and didn't need anything else.
     The food was excellent - better than we expected. So many restaurants in LV are just okay but Maggiano's far exceeded our other experiences. Food was hot and flavorful.
     The restaurant had a nice warm and welcoming feeling inside.  And we were surprised at the bill - so reasonable! We really enjoyed our dining experience and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Maggianos is my favorite Italian restaurant on the strip. Service is fast and food is great. They make it a point to give you the best experience possible."}
{"text":"The Food was a 5 star and only marked down to 4 for the noise inside.    But it is a very happy place.   Service and Waiters were great, attentive and looked after us instantly.   Very clean place, parking very close by and easy.   The menu is really good and I had the Spaghetti with Meatball!   The meatball was so huge in the center of a deep bowl like plate of spaghetti it looked like a mountain!    It was some of the best spaghetti I've ever eaten outside of my home and the meatball was great as well.  The bread with oil, balsimic vinegar with cheese while waiting was great and we quickly given refills and even butter on request.    I believe my hug portion as around $13.95 which I thought was very, very reasonable given the quantity and quality of of my food.   Then to really blow my mind they gave me an entire 2nd helping all packaged to take home in a bag!!!!   Dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Fast service, awesome food.  The food tastes like it's home cooked.  A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to this Maggiano's numerous times as well as had it catered at our offices, however this review is solely based on the service that we received today (March 10, 2010) 

My company was hosting a going away luncheon for my lovely coworker Samantha, who is leaving us to go to France, but I will stop my ranting about that. BOOO! LOL Anyways back to Maggiano's. It started when we arrived. The hostess was chatting it up with a patron at the bar so we had to wait for her to finish up, now the reason why I am little disturbed as there were two other servers as well as someone who appeared to be a manager standing right by the hostess station. They looked at us, however they did not acknowledge us in the 3 mins we stood there waiting for the hostess to finish her conversation with the patron at the bar. FAIL! 

Finally we were acknowledged and we were told where the rest of our party was. We were all seated and about 5 mins or so, drink orders were taken. 15 mins after the orders were taken and we received our drinks,(no I am not over exaggerating either) we get some bread baskets at each table, which was great because we were pretty famished. Fast forward another 15 mins and our appetizers arrived. Now mind you this menu was predetermined days ago so it wasn't like we had to wait for people to order and it was all going to be family style. Now although the appetizers were tasty, we had to wait about another 25 mins after that for the appetizers to be taken away and an additional 20 mins for the lunch to arrive. FAIL! 

Now any other time, I would not have a problem if the place was jam packed, but it was not. See what they had failed to mention to us when we arrived is that a water main was broken in front of the restaurant so they no longer had running water. From what I understand, they had brought in more than enough water to get through the lunch rush, but they had called those who had reservations for dinner because they were closing down for the rest of the day due the water main problem. How the hell can you not tell your patrons that you don't have running water and the only way that you find out is because one of your coworkers happens to go to the bathroom and their is someone standing at the door to let you know that there is no running water but there are big coffee pots full of hot water for you to wash your hands however you cannot flush the toilet. WTF??! Great so now we had a better understanding as to why things were taking so long. Had they told us this before hand, I am sure we would have went somewhere else. Especially since we didn't find out until halfway into our meal. FAIL! 

Maggiano's I am very disappointed in you today. Our company orders from you quite a bit and I understand that the only discount you gave is that you didn't charge us to take the leftover food back to three coworkers that couldn't make it. Seriously?! Yes I understand that there were circumstances out of your control, but as courtesy you should have told us what was going on and let us decide how to proceed. What should have been a quick 2 hour max lunch turned into a long 3+ hour lunch, which would have been ok any other time had their been working bathrooms. FAIL! 

So like I said, this review is solely based on the service today. Any other time you would get at least 4 stars . Today you only get 1, and that is being generous. If someone from the restaurant happens to read this review, be careful if you decide to email me with \"hate mail\" because you know you guys were in the wrong today. FAIL! FAIL! FAIL!"}
{"text":"Had the Seafood Ciopino over pasta in a spicy Diavolo sauce. Included a lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, and fish.  It was the best Ciopino ever!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Make sure to make a reservation on Open Table.  I get the Marco's special. 2 large salads, 2 entrees, 2 take home entrees, and a dessert to share. I think $50.  Well worth it.  The service has always been outstanding."}
{"text":"Great lunch time with my buddy Michael , he had the Rustic and shrimp al forno,  delicious creamy on the bottom and crispy on the top , he had a Mint Mojito  and finally an apple crostata. I at the other hand had  Rigatoni\"D supposed to be a top of the line and very famous,  it was a nice presentation,  fresh ingredients and very creamy, the chicken was tender, I had a glass of Prosecco \"Rufino\", I asked the 2 bartenders Arnold who works there for over 3 and half years , What can you tell me about this Prosecco?  He stopped and slowly mention it was good Italian sparkling wine good for apetizers and sweet then he turned around and left mmm. But I wanted to know more so I asked the other bartender Erick so he mentioned the same stuff Arnold but he didn't turn around to leave he saud Is there anything else I should know. I immediately answer yes , so I showed him on the bottle where the wine was from, what winery , who bought it , the type of grape and the process of making.  I have been in many up scale restaurant and I still have not got a clear and informative answer.  My guess is bartenders should know more about wine as well. There an urgency of mire wine education in Arizona. But I'm here to change that."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Maggianos in LA, Seattle and now Vegas and it never disappoints. It's high quality Italian food at a reasonable price. The highlight for me is always the dessert! Staff have always been friendly and attentive and I've yet to order something I haven't enjoyed. Definitely recommend this chain to anyone who's visiting the area near by. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Yes, another, \"Wish I could eat the whole menu\" restaurant. 

I air in the bar area and Danny helps me out. He serves me a good dark and stormy.  There was this fried seafood mysteries. It was good but over breaded. I think amount of bread on seafood is overdone. But this selection was good for fried. 

Now comes the fish. It's grouper over French broccoli and cut potatoes."}
{"text":"Overall Awful, had the fried calamari which was tender,so that was great, however, the portion should have been larger (calamari is so inexpensive) the sauce was too sweet and loaded with sugar & oregano (a little oregano is for pizza-not sauce -basil goes in sauce). The eggplant parm was served over a small amount of pasta which should be served separately-was awful -not fresh -was mushy -the same sweet thick sauce. Maggianos needs to fix there red sauce and provolone doesn't go on eggplant parmigiana. The bread on the table was good tho."}
{"text":"This is a classy place, but the peasantry are still welcome in their chosen garb. We had just walked the entire strip up and down, on a 90 degree day - burned out, chaffed, and hungry. The cool, intimate environment of Maggiano's really set the tone for the night's coming festivities. I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which was basically linguine, and a pound of shrimp smothered in a creamy and spicy tomato sauce. It was good. I ate the entire plate - but it was certainly enough for two or three people. We had recently been engaged, and the waiter found out and brought us some handsome italian cookies and chocolates with a little candle to celebrate. The bread was good, the atmosphere was refined, and the seats were really comfy. It's a strange place, because it seems fancy from the outside, but when you go in, it's like you just walked onto the set of Cheers - where everybody knows your name. 

There are a ton of places to eat in Vegas. But if you've got a hankerin' for solid Italian food, Maggiano's is the affordable and delicious spot on the strip. Located just underneath the giant metal UFO in the fashion district - which I assume brings the street performers to the Bellagio sidewalk every night. Once you climb the massive set of stairs, you'll find the restaurant, and also be in a great spot to people watch from on high. 

Anyway, it's not the best Italian food I've had, but it's very far from \"just edible.\" I enjoyed my meal, and the total experience was great, but it was nothing life changing."}
{"text":"Went last night and our dinner was amazing. This place was recommended by a local we met on our flight to Vegas. The atmosphere, food and service were all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow...not my first visit and not my last. I am a Vegas local and we still go to the strip to exclusively dine at Maggianos. Yesterday we went for lunch for Fathers Day. Our server was Mac and he was fabulous! His energy, attitude, and professionalism were wonderful. I have a horrendous shellfish allergy. Mac and who seemed to be the manager were on top of it and it meant the world to me! Now on to the food...the Caprese salad is just scrumptious! The balsamic vinaigrette was so sweet and hearty so the light drizzle was perfect! The mozz and tomatoes were cut with equal thickness...so each bite had the right ratio of decadent cheese, fresh tomato, sweet and savory balsamic with a pinch of fresh basil. I had the chicken piccata and holy moly it is just delectable. I am typically not a fan of Capers but you could put just about anything on this entree and it would magically make it yummy. The chicken is thin and has just right texture and plumpness to soak up the magnificent sauce. I also had the four cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and it was so delicious. They do put a small amount of red sauce over the top. In the future I would ask them to either hold that sauce or put it on the side. I found the white pesto sauce was more than enough. My daughter had the macaroni and cheese and for a two-and-a-half-year-old it truly fit the bill! My husband had the chicken parmesan and left a very happy man! The bread we first received was very warm and they had the right amount of accoutrement on the table to make a fun dipping plate. My husband used the fresh olive oil, added red pepper flakes, and fresh parmesan to dip his bread. We would recommend this to any family for any occasion big or small. The prices are beyond reasonable for the ambiance, the taste of the food, and the portion sizes. What a wonderful way to celebrate Father's Day. Thank you Mac for making it worry-free"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. The crab cakes were solid; not Pacific NW good but still great for the middle of the desert. Portions were large so wishing my wife and and I would have split and entree. The Lobster Carbonara was excellent. The bacon and lobster gave the spag noodles a rich flavor."}
{"text":"Love, love, love that you can place an order on line. Placed order for a family meal and had my daughter stop by on her way home from work to pick it up for us. Lasagna, chicken parmigiana along with Caesar salad and lemon cookies for dessert. When you order on line you can ask them to have it ready by a certain time for pickup. It was easy, reasonably priced and food was wonderful. The only downside was that on a Saturday parking is a little tough to find, they should have a specific area for customers to park for their pick-up orders. Be sure to check and make sure that they don't forget the bread."}
{"text":"Delicious food mmm, it reminds me of Popolis back at home in Cedar Rapids when that was a thing for me. Love the house salad and the food is so juicy and not dry, so good!! Will be looking forward to coming back!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here at Maggianos and I have to say the service is great. I had the mom's lasagna and  enjoyed every bite, also the portion size is big enough to feed two."}
{"text":"With that name, they're not exactly serving corned beef and cabbage... the food is excellent, one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  The two story eatery is well laid out, the staff is friendly, cheerful and attentive.  I've been there with small parties, large parties, and never been dissappointed."}
{"text":"They close early if it's not busy.  I went there to get some food to go at 9:25pm.  They supposedly close at 10.  The door was already locked.  I banged on it until someone opened.  Someone opened the door and said they were about to have an \"employee meeting\".  I asked to see a manager.  The manager said they closed because it was slow.  So I was lied to either way.  Sad because I do like their food.  Never again!"}
{"text":"We always end up eating here at least once every time someone comes to visit us. :) My husband is a big fan of italian food, so it works out great. He can never get sick of spaghetti, but i like trying different things... chicken alfredo or chicken marsala seem to be my main dishes :) 

The location is perfect! Shop a little til you get hungry, then go to Maggiano's. Or eat first, then shop... either way, its a win-win. There might be quite a wait if you go around 6 or 7pm, but if you go there for lunch or something it works out perfect."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is conveniently located in the Fashion Show mall below The Capital Grille.  It was my first time here and the food was better than I had expected.  I went with my beautiful girlfriend for lunch.  She had signed up for their mailing list and received a coupon good for $10.00 off our total meal.  The server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal (after she had learned that we were locals).  We ordered Chicken Fetuccini Alfredo, Baked Ziti, and the Fried Zuchinni as an appetizer.  We were about to order more than the Fried Zuchinni for an appetizer, but I'm glad we didn't.  They turned out to be Zuchinni Spears (6) and they were huge! The breading on the Zuchinni was to die for!  It was cooked to perfection. I wonder if they used Panko to bread it?  I highly recommend it.  The Ziti was not that impressive at all.  It was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste.  My Alfredo was good and rich in taste.  I had no complaints about the service (they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked...no reservation made).  We had a good view of the strip and Wynn casino.  I'd definitely come here again.  I would have scored them 5 star, but the Ziti knocked 'em down.  Next time, I want to try their Calamari!"}
{"text":"So our expectations were high having visited the strip many times. This was a sad trip. Ambience is only to be found in bar. The food...bread, eggplant, pasta and spinach dip all way below bar. Sorry this on the chef. Could be upper management due to staffing...they better fix. This is basically a locals place, so when the negative reviews get out you will not do well. Our waitress , Lauren was excellent. Beverage Manger did very well for sure...Management fix it and soon."}
{"text":"All the food here is just really unremarkable based on my visit.  Nothing special, everything seems just unoriginal and aimed at middle of the road palates, not creating anything exceptional or memorable."}
{"text":"First time here and at Maggiano's. Didn't disappoint when we came with a party of 6 for a birthday dinner. The calamari came out crispy and perfectly cooked. We did the Marco's Meal where you can take home an extra pasta the next day. The cool thing is it comes out cold so that it will reheat perfectly with instructions online too! I ordered the lasagna and it was so creamy and delicious. Exactly what you want in fine Italian food. Pair it with wine. And the ultimate dessert... Creme brûlée! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their chef special. Two entree for $40 & you each take a dish of your choice home."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people think Maggiano's in just another bad chain but I whole heartedly disagree.  I have never had a bad meal, maybe some bad servers but I overlook that for good food.  My family usually does Christmas Eve here and we always have a nice enjoyable experience, and its always crowded so it blocks out the noise my nephews tend to make!  Except one year we were taking pictures and some woman was giving us the evil eye, uh hello lady its a holiday and we have adorable kids all dressed up here, of course we're going to take pics!!

Stopped by Tuesday for a late lunch.  The bread they give is nice and soft and warm.  I then went for a house chopped salad, it comes w/tomato, avocado, bacon, blue cheese and I love it.  For my entree I went with the garlic shrimp with linguine.  I've had it a million times and its always great.

On other occassions I have loved the fried zucchini, mussels, stuffed mushrooms, caprese salad, braised beef cannelloni, baked ziti, chicken francese and the creme brulee.

Not sure if we're going for Xmas eve again this year but I like this place so I will return again and again."}
{"text":"Omg the food was great and the service! Not a long wait at all and the restaurant was cozy and clean! We had no plans on going here but we were all hungry and it was close to the mall! Everyone was nicely, casually dressed and the greatest part was the fiord was excellent with reasonable prices! 

I will stop here again upon returning in 13 days!"}
{"text":"Summary: It's not anything special and there are better places, including corporate restaurants.

Service - 3.0:  My wife and I opted to eat dinner at the bar.  Our bartender was great.  He was professional, friendly, fun, and even engaging at times.  He was the best thing about the establishment and I give him 5 stars.   Everyone else around sucked.  We had a white floor manager and a black server talking in front of us about an interest a girl.  The conversation itself wasn't offensive, but the white floor manager did an impressive \"talk like a stereotypical black guy because I'm talking with a black guy and I want to relate\" voice.  It was annoying.  We were serenaded the entire evening by floor managers and employees discussing side work and moving into minimal staffing for the evening.  I've worked front and back of house at corporate restaurants and that's behavior that we didn't allow--it's unprofessional even at a corporate place.  It's especially unprofessional at a place that tries to be classy.    I also didn't like the timing of our meal.  The apps and salad came out super-fast while the entrees took a very long time.  I would have given service a 1.0 if our bartender had not been such a great host.

In an attempt to up the service level, they pop new customers into the POS system as \"new guest,\" which signals the kitchen to send out a couple slices of bruschetta.  I'm not a fan of the gimmick.  It's supposed to make you feel special, that you receive food compliments of the chef, but really it's just execution of a corporate policy.  Further, it's just a menu item, not some special amuse bouche created that day.  The practice is lame.

Ambiance/décor - 3.0: I'm going to nitpick because this place tries to look fancy--it attempts to give off an upscale and classy feeling.  Our bartender wore a tie and suit vest and the servers all wore dress shirts with black ties.   The walls are lined with dark wood and the tables are dressed in white.  However, the walls also display signed pictures of random celebrities and menu posters about family style meals.  Apparently the menus are remnants of an earlier time when the restaurant was trying to be a fancier looking Buca di Beppo.  The wall candy contrasts too much with the upscale feeling the restaurant wants to portray.  It would be a 4.0 if the 

Menu - 2.0: It's Macaroni Grill food at a higher price and without the option to create your own pasta.  There's nothing original or special that sets the menu apart from any other generic Italian joint.  The décor tries so hard to be classy but the food is uninspired.  I didn't see anything on the menu that excited me.   Apparently most of their customers enjoy the \"classic pasta\" category of food because, for about $12 to $14, you receive one pasta dish to eat at the restaurant and a second pasta dish of your choosing to take home.  At least the menu provides an opportunity for cheap eats.

Food - 2.5: It's just not special.  The food doesn't seem to consist of the cryo-vac disgusting that one might encounter at am Olive Garden, or Applebee's; however, it wasn't anything to write home about.  We ate bruschetta, a chopped salad, an 18oz veal porterhouse with broccolini, and a lasagnia (a classic pasta dish).  We took the Bowtie Aglio as our take-home pasta.  The food seemed mostly fresh and the seasoned properly.  Nothing was over-salted or bad tasting, but it's no better than the Italian food you would get at any chicken parm serving Italian restaurant.  The pasta was a tad overcooked, but that's done with dry pasta at most corporate joints.  What really caught my attention is how the restaurant gives its diners the take-home pasta already refrigerated.  That most likely means all the classic pasta dishes are essentially pre-prepped and just reheated at service time.  I find myself wondering if they pasta dishes are prepped off-site or if they make the pasta dishes in-house.  I couldn't tell either way, but it's a curiosity I now hold.  The veal was also topped with a ton of garlic, but the garlic wasn't strong.  That means the garlic they use isn't fresh.  

Overall - 2.5: I didn't factor in any corporate aspects of the restaurant into my review.  However, save a few bucks on the entrees and just go to Macaroni Grill if you're seeking a corporate meal.  It's the same owners, thus a similar menu, but Macaroni Grill isn't playing pretend fancy with the restaurant concept and the food quality is exactly the same.  Macaroni Grill can sometimes be home to high level of customer chaos that doesn't occur at Maggiano's, but that's really all that Maggiano's offers.   If you want actual upscale Italian, don't be a cheapskate.  Go somewhere that offers a real upscale vibe or somewhere that serves from-scratch, chef-driven food."}
{"text":"Best Italian Meal Ever!!!  We ordered the Famous Rigatoni D, Lobster Carbonara, Bruschetta, salad and  creamy tomato basil soup.  Even the salad dressings were yummy.  Great service and pretty view of the Wynn and the Encore  hotels.  Looking forward to trying them at home in SoCal.  We had to come to Vegas to try them out."}
{"text":"I was so excited at the thought of only driving  a short 5 minutes to Maggiano's in DT Summerlin vs. driving all of the way to the strip, but not anymore. Unfortunately, I will have to continue taking the trek down to the strip if I want hot and fresh Italian food instead of defrosted and microwaved Italian food, or simply walk to one of the other 2 Italian restaurants that taste much better.
Our waiter, Tommy, did a great job serving us and everyone else was very nice and attentive. Throughout the service my daughter and I kept saying something about the look and flavors of the dishes we had ( lasagna and fettuccini alfredo) resembled and tasted like canned sauce and microwaved meals. Normally on the strip the food comes out piping hot and you can actually see and taste the basil, garlic and oregano. Don't expect that at the DT Summerlin location...2 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service - whomp, whomp."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and attentive service. We live 45 minutes away, but Maggianos has become our place to dine when we come to Beachwood. I personally love the nostalgic decor. It reminds me of a warm Italian grandma's house:) My sons and I stopped by Sunday afternoon before shopping. Derek our server was attentive and spot on with our drinks and food. The chicken piccata was the best I've ever eaten and the portion was large...enough left for dinner too. My sons raved about the chicken parm and shrimp with pasta. The tiramisu and crime brûlée were a perfect end to the meal. The food and service is always top notch. We can't wait to come back! Our take out boxes were wonderful! Reheating instructions on the lid are a welcome touch."}
{"text":"On March 25th, I threw a small dinner party at Maggiano's in one of their private rooms. The service was above and beyond expectation. Our party had 5 small energetic children who were continuously running around the room and playing with balloons and our server Lisa was extraordinarily patient and kind. If it bothered her, she didn't let it show at all! On top of that, Lisa's service was perfect: drinks were always filled, dirty dishes immediately grabbed out of the way, and food was timed perfectly. Our event coordinator was also outstanding and incredibly accommodating. I believe his name was Josh. When some guests had last minute requests, he granted them all quickly and without fuss. He constantly checked on the party and assured everything went smoothly. (Also, was very friendly.) 

The food was also delicious. We've been to Maggiano's many times and our favorites are always the Italian Tossed Salad, Stuffed Mozzarella, Chicken Marsala, and the Chocolate Zuccotto Cake. Last night, we adventured out and tried some different things. I feel it is worth noting that the Sausage & Peppers and Beef Medallions Pizzaiola were huge hits. 

Overall, everything was fantastic. The service definitely deserves praise though. As a former waitress of five years, I can truly say they went above and beyond expectation and I highly recommend hosting any future events here!"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian place...even though it is a chain.  I highly recommend the Spaghetti and Meatball.  I get cravings for this all the time.  Don't overlook it as a chain.  Itis worth a meal!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, good people and great music. Place looks super clean. Staff is amazing we discuss what we wanted, suggestions were great. Food taste amazing we had a lot there and also took home. Lasagna taste amazing. Service at the bar was great. No complains at all. Good tales just the right amount of time!  I will recommend this place at downtown summerlin. Located near two parking lots, short walk."}
{"text":"I'm now a regular.  It's that good.... and affordable. 
Fair portion sizes,  great flavors,  staff are very well trained.
The stuffed mushrooms are really the best I've ever had. 
The ceasar salad is flavored well,  not too heavy. 
My favorite is chicken piccata.
Located in Downtown Summerlin,  take advantage of the free valet right outside. 
The cheesecake is also excellent."}
{"text":"My seafood linguini tasted good!! Now I know what's linguini at least after the experience with the server we got. First of all. I'm not experience in Italian food so I was just ask is there any pasta comes with this dish as I pointed out on the menu because I don't even know how to pronounce it to be honest. He shouted \"LINGUINI!!\" I have to ask what's linguini on top of that.\"LIKE NOODLE!\" Of course I wouldn't ask if I know what's linguini. He seemed annoyed. I felt like u will have those kinda service if u stick with ice water at the beginning. He brought out some bread. But later ask if we want butter after we choke down half basket of the bread. Food take long time to come out but I understand it's busy but my food tasted good that's all matter to me. But I just don't like the service this guy provided. Just because you didn't sale as much as you could or I didn't order as much as I should or maybe cause I didn't know about the food. Educate your customer about Italian food in a friendly welcome way. Not the kind of\"you should know about Italian once you dine here\" way."}
{"text":"We chose Maggiano's to celebrate my birthday while on vacation in Las Vegas.  We got a table right away and our server was Nick.  He did an excellent job!  He was very friendly and helped us selection our dishes.  The appetizers are somewhat expensive, but the food was excellent.  A great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Service:  3.5 Stars

Attentive.  Cordial.  Tapped out our drinks.  Made sure we were fine and dandy like a jovial Dean Martin singing that Mambo Italiano song.  Oh wait, this song WAS played during our meal on 3.20.09.  I'm sure it loops every day though.

Decor:  3.5 Stars

Fancier than Macaroni Grill and I should hope so as this is Vegas and a step above its sister restaurant.  The seating was vast and it could probably fit at least 5 bachelorette parties.  Oh yeaaahh...  bachelorette parties...   *droool*  There weren't too many people let alone bachelorette parties, but most patrons were enjoying the beautiful weather in their outdoor seating area.

Food:  3 Stars

The minestrone was ok.  It was a bit cheesy and the color seemed paler (not as tomato-red) and its taste was different than most minestrone soups I've had.  

I had the Lobster Fettuccine.  There wasn't much lobster.  Italian Sausages were also few and a bit burnt.  The peas and artichokes gave it a nice balance.  The white wine cream sauce was really good but a little salty than I like my pasta sauces to be.  So this Little Italy Favorite is a mainstay in San Francisco fare?  I'm glad I had the chance to savor it in Vegas.

I'd come back.  I'd probably go someplace closer though, like Orange County and go all out Family Style.  

P.S. - To the previous Yelpers, I agree that the food made me thirsty; however, this place isn't as salty as their cousin On The Border in Rancho Cucamonga.

P.P.S. - Update 3/26.  I just read an article in Yahoo Health today:  http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/26542/americas-unhealthiest-restaurants.  Chili's, On the Border, and Macaroni Grill - all owned by Maggiano's parent company, Brinker are on the hit list and the sodium count on their menu items aren't benefiting my pre-hypertension."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the Chicken piccata and linguini (also ordered the calamari as an appetizer)....the food is only a step above the Olive Garden...but much pricier. The Chicken was just ok...lemon sauce had mild flavor and you couldn't even taste the capers....the calamari was bland and nothing special....basically a waste of $125.....the four glasses of wine the table ordered were way overpriced as well. The service was pretty good overall. I won't be going back to this one or any others."}
{"text":"This review reflects my most recent visit to maggianos as my past experiences were positive but pre Yelp! I was pretty disappointed with this dining experience, it started off with the caprese as an app which was actually pretty good! My mom ordered the light fettuccini as her entree which she said was \"meh okay.\" I was craving me some penne a la vodka and the menu said we could make special orders so I thought a simple dish like that would be okay. The waiter gave me the options of whole wheat penne or gluten free, and I went with the whole wheat. My penne came out not cooked all the way and with little vodka sauce. I REALLY hate to be that person but I just couldn't eat it. The waiter made the comment that I probably didn't like it because \"whole wheat pasta is healthy\" and then the experience went downhill from there. He brought me the fettuccini which I felt was a bit bland. I was sad because I have had only very positive experiences in the past but the food this time wasn't very good and the waiter was a bit condescending throughout our experience."}
{"text":"Went with a  party of 10, went family style and two hours later still no entree.  Manager  understood the frustration, and said server was new.   Manager comped the bill, but didn't eat the food after two hours.  Waste of my time, and the restaurants supposed service.  Disappointing in both expectation and execution."}
{"text":"Awesome place the food was top notch, the service perfect! Atmosphere was upscale but casual if that makes sense.
We had the chef special, baked ziti , and mushroom ravioli... 
Chain restaurants and us don't usually sit well however I would recomend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We came here last night as a group of 6 to celebrate a friends birthday. I had heard great things about Maggiano's from friends and co-workers over the years. Since we love Italian food, I was very excited for this meal.

Quite the disappointment. 

We ordered Johnny's Carbonara  ($18.25) and Mom's Lasagna ($16.95). The food was actually quite good! Portion sizes are generous and filling. My carbonara was creamy and rich and the bacon was cooked perfectly! I have zero complaints about the food. We had several appetizers and deserts as well. The flat bread pizza was a perfect light snack to enjoy while waiting for our main dishes. Plus after the meal that chocolate cake was out of this world! Very rich!

I really dig the atmosphere as well! Plenty of touches that scream Italy and Vegas, like pics of the Rat Pack and whatnot. 

why the 2 stars?

Unfortunately, lackluster service was the issue. Nathan was our waiter for the evening. While the service wasn't completely terrible, several things were amiss. Items requested were forgotten, even after he verified the request. Drink orders were separate and staggered, instead of together. 

I guess where all the disappointment stems from is when we went to pay the bill and leave. We went as essentially 3 sets of 2 people. When asking for the bills to be split, just having 2 people put on one separate bill proved to be such an apparently laborious task, we decided to just settle the last 4 among ourselves. For the 2 of us, our bill came to roughly $36 dollars. I rounded up to $40 and added a $10 tip. I was charged a flat $50 and signed my credit card slip. 

Nathan came back and then told me that the $50 did not include his tip. Mind you, he was tipped from all parties at the table. He was taken care of in that regards, and I think quite well all things considered.  He basically just stood there over me without saying a word. I did not want to gripe over $10 at a special friends birthday gathering, so I gave him another $10 cash. It felt like a shakedown and left a very sour taste in my mouth. Everyone at the table agreed that it was out of line and inappropriate. For this alone, we will not be back to Maggiano's. 

I hope that $10 was worth it, because now 6 people have a sour opinion of Maggiano's and we will certainly seek other options for our regular get togethers.

I am still quite annoyed with how the situation played out and this ruined what was otherwise a great meal with great friends. I am not going to give them 1 star simply because the food was very good. 

But we will not be back and I'm pretty sure our friends were just as put off by the whole thing as well.

2 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! I love the take home another entree deal. Love it. If you love Italian you gotta try this place. Reserve a table using Open Table works perfectly."}
{"text":"Threw my sisters baby sprinkle here, 45 people, it was amazing! Very reasonably priced, food couldn't have been better, and they refilled as much as we wanted. Hector and Keith were our servers and were GREAT! Highly recommend this for events, or even dinner for 2. Food was super tasty!!! Thank you for helping us make this such a special and great event!"}
{"text":"My daughter had her 16th birthday party last week. I requested a private dining room and Sheldon explained that they unfortunately don't offer that on weekend nights but he did his best to put us in a more private area. He even helped me with the menu options a week before the party and he helped me decorate the table. He took great care of all of our needs. The next time I plan on going out I will be coming back here. You won't find any place with better service. Sheldon was so accommodating. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. My Dad loves a good spaghetti and meatballs, it's his go to favorite meal.  And me myself, I LOVE Chicken Parmesan. We went here  when we were visiting my Dad in the fall. We had a great, amazing view of the Strip, and it was right as the sun going down... PERFECT.

We all had great food, and great service. I know it's a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great.

Hopefully, next trip out to Vegas to visit me Dad, we can stop again."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant I've been to in Vegas in the strip!

Lobster Carbonara was uniquely the best italian I've had as far!"}
{"text":"We dined at Maggiano's last night. And the only reason I can give it three stars is because my two friends that I was dining with stated that their meals were okay. I had the balsamic glazed salmon which was very overcooked and probably the smallest portion I have Everseen, And the balsamic sauce was very heavy, however the asparagus it came with was good. One of my friends had their spaghetti with meat sauce and he said it was good. My other friend had the salmon Oscar, And said the sauce that it comes then was very good however the salmon was again overcooked and a very small piece. To top it off our meal took almost an hour to come to the table. Our waiter John did his best to be attentive. And the atmosphere was good, and staff seem to be trying hard. However I do not believe I will ever be eating here again."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and it was Father's Day. The service was great here and the food matched! The ambiance was perfect for the occasion. Nice family place and great for big gatherings. I was lucky enough to meet the chef. I informed my server that I was gluten free and it was an allergy. She assured me there would be a dish that the chef could Make for me. It was a great touch to have the chef come out and take my personal gluten free order. He made sure I found a Dish that was suitable for my needs. I ordered pasta and it was AMAZING! Best gluten free Italian dish I've had. My picky daughter even ate the pasta and salad. My husband was very happy with his special day and experience and wants to go back asap. My only wish is that Maggianos would provide gluten free bread/flatbread. You have gluten free pasta, why not offer bread??"}
{"text":"Not certain why all the 5 stars. I had dinner there last  night because it was convenient. The food was fair and that is being generous. The noodles were way over cooked and the oil used to cook the chicken had no appealing taste. I had the chicken francaise that was soaked in a butter sauce. No dish should be drowning in a butter sauce. The salad had wilted lettuce and over dressed. The service I will say was excellent but this in itself is not why I go out for dinner.  They say this is Italian food but can't imagine that any Italian would say this is good sauce.  Too many good Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas area to ever go back."}
{"text":"OMG!! Sausage & peppers, Italian sausage flatbread and baked ziti....wowsers!! Great food, beautiful restaurant and excellent customer service! Brian and Bella were awesome; they made out of towners very welcome!"}
{"text":"2 stars, because I've definitely experienced better.


I booked a reservation through Open Table. I actually changed my reservation twice because my parents' plans kept changing. First I scheduled it at 7pm, then I changed it to 6pm, then finally to 6:45. I got a confirmation email for each change, so it was fine. In my reservation I specifically stated: We would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mother's 63rd birthday. Did that happen? NOPE.

When we arrived at 6:45, I went up to the heavy set host/supervisor who didn't even care to greet me and told him I had a reservation that I made on Open Table for 6:45. He clicked around on his computer and said he didn't see and record of it. I proceeded to login to my Open Table account and pull up the whole reservation on my Ipod. I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that'd prove me wrong, but there was nothing. My reservation was right there on my phone. He told me \"well, you should really call to verify your reservations\" and I said, \"Oh, does this happen a lot here?\" he said, \"No, that's never happened. This is the first time I've ever seen that happen.\" As if I made everything up! I tried to explain that I changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why, and he said \"no, that wouldn't be the reason.\" So wtf is the reason then? Not that I care, but he just stood there making it seem as if I forged a reservation on my phone or something. Ridiculous. After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn't see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he'll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor. They took us to the back, as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar, so the only view we could've gotten was then blocked. 

I was very upset. The whole reason why I chose this place for my mom's birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view. Instead, we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of $114 for. I could've gotten a better ambiance at Olive Garden with employees 5x more polite and a bill half as high. At least the food was good...too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down. 

To make matters even worse. I went home and checked my email, only to find that Maggiano's marked me as a NO SHOW on Open Table. How the F*ck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly NOT THERE?! 100 points out the window. I had to contact customer service to explain that I was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof, so I wouldn't have the no show on my record. Their response, \"Based on our diagnostics, your reservation was in the restaurant's electronic reservation book, but for some reason this was not conveyed to you. Thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy!\" Hmm, I wonder why that happened?

Very upset with Maggiano's and that heavy set host/supervisor man, so much that I don't plan on coming back here anymore. I'll Splurge on Capital Grille instead if I want that same view."}
{"text":"I was craving good pasta and usually never take a cab for just past.  This was the best decision I made the food and service was spectacular.  We had four dishes including this fettuccine Alfredo spaghetti and marinara sauce four cheese ravioli and chicken Parmesan and all the dishes were delicious.  The service was great including our excellent services by our waiter Robert Toth was the best ever."}
{"text":"Have always gotten pasta when at Maggiano's and it has always been the best ever so this time we decided to get peppercorn sirloin. OMG it was the best!!  Since it comes with peppercorn sauce, not knowing if we would like it, we asked for it on the side which was a good idea since we did not like the sauce.  I love this place."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner just now.  The service was excellent, food came out fast and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
We definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight with the family. I thought it was rather strange that you have to walk through the bar to get to the hostess station in the dinning room. The hostess tried seating us at one of those booths on one side and chairs on the other side next to the hostess stand right in the path of all the traffic.........NOT. I told the hostess I wasn't digging the seating arrangement and needed to a table near all the grownups instead of at the kids table.

The tables don't have much elbow room and are wedged tightly together close to all of  the other nearby tables. My neighboor from a nearby table pulled out his chair into my chair. Needless to say, the ambiance is lacking and makes it difficult to have conversations without hearing bits and pieces of the adjoining table's conversations......So knock off one star.

The food was good and the portions were very generous with a price tag of $65 before tip, the waiter did a fine job. I had the Chicken Parmasean which came with a side of Spaghetti. My family had the Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. This particular dish is a two for one special in which you get to take home another meal. My boys took home another order of Spaghetti and Meatballs and my wife took home an order of Lasagna for my dinner tomorrow.....Win!"}
{"text":"Pluses: Inviting decor/atmosphere, good food and cocktails (which were fairly reasonably priced), and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Minuses: Even though we had reservations, it still took 20 mins before we were actually seated and we had to wait in two different fusterclucked lines - people were bumping into each other and unsure where to stand or go (numerous signs for the \"Host Stand\" were borderline comical, giving an Alice gone through the looking glass experience - but with annoyed tourists); we asked the seater to speak to management (we were there for family celebration,and the evening wasn't feeling terribly \"special\" with this first impression), who didn't appear until 50 mins later (that's because she never bothered to contact himl) - the manager was extremely defensive, admittedly he was probably slightly broadsided by our complaints but still seemed barely receptive to the criticisms and made repeated excuses about \"the layout of the restaurant\" and told us we should've came in via the revolving doors that we almost got whacked with twice because \"most of our traffic comes off the Strip\" (we'd already explained we were locals, apparently we shouldn't come in where the valet is). All in all, we'd have been better off going to a nice local joint like Chicago Joe's - this place was basically a fancier version of the Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it two stars because the bread is delicious! my food arrived barely warm, not cool."}
{"text":"Simple chain restaurant with family style feel.  

I've been to Maggiano's a few times and found the food very consistent.  I would recommend grabbing a reservation in advance of going here as it gets very busy.  Rather than comment on all the dishes we had, I'll just generally say that everything was well cooked, flavorful, and something I would order again.  As for the service, it was also excellent.  The menu is affordable and the service is great.  Of course there are better restaurants (Lavo, Nove, etc.), but not in this price range."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Alexandra was Awesome she was so smart! Derek the manager came by and talk to us he was so nice and spent his busy time talking with us for a min. Food was great an awesome special that night and even my 5 year old nephew had fun. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Chains are generally not my thing...but Maggiano's always delivers delish.

Recently visited with a co worker on a Thursday night that is generally busy for the restaurant but they seated us right away even though they had a packed house.

I love how they will let me customize my dish...ergo shrimp scampi with the hand twisted pasta, add basil.  We also ordered their fried mozzarella and each of us tried their special lemonade.  Delish!  I did not have room for any of their tasty bread..except maybe a bite of course to remember how good it is.  My meal was enough for 3.  This place delivers food that I actually will eat as leftovers!

I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain and I am more of a local place kind of gal.  But there is no denying that this is some really good Italian food.  This is my first time dining at this particular location in Scottsdale and we were very impressed.  I really love the ambiance inside but we chose to dine on the lovely and quaint patio this evening.  The only thing missing is music.  They do have speakers but I'm not sure why there wasn't music playing as that would have added a lot to the evening!  The patio makes me feel like I am in Italy.  
Now on to the food.  We enjoyed a tasting of several different classic pastas and all were delicious.  The beef short rib pappardelle was very unique and my husband loved it.  Also, and let me tell you I never order Alfredo out because my mamma makes HANDS DOWN the best Alfredo in the world.  That being said, my kids ordered it here and I had to taste it and I was very impressed.  Definitely the best I have ever tried in a restaurant and I would even order it (believe me, that says a lot).
Some of their entrees are on the pricey side so I will stick to the pasta classics.  This is a great spot for delicious pasta and bread.
We had great service as well!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had the spaghetti and meatball and could not be happier! The only reason I won't give 5 stars is that our waiter was horrible. We sat for a good 15 minutes without him refilling any drinks or taking our order. But we requested another waitress and Sarah was amazing! She more than made up for the lack of service. If everyone was like her it would be a 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a decent Italian restaurant located at the front of the Fashion Show mall.  Service is always good and their family style menu is pretty decent too with 3 different levels to choose from.  The wine list is pretty limited but has some nice selections.  I came here the other night with my married couple friends and their daughter.  Nice date, too bad she's 32 years younger than me!  This night I had the fried zucchini for an appetizer.  I would have never ordered this since I a) don't eat fried food and b) don't care for zucchini.  The waiter said it was a big hit and he was right, it was really good.  My entree was the baked ziti which was prepared quite nice with Italian sausage and just the right amount of baked on cheese.  The portion size was perfect.  For desert we got the 10 dollar sampler which you would expect to be too small for 4 people...it had about 5 different deserts and all were very good.  Negatives:  very busy, and no cannoli's. What self respecting Italian joint doesn't have home made cannoli's? Oh well..."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the Maggiano's in downtown Summerlin. Family and I came into the restaurant around 5:30 right before the dinner rush. We got a table rather easily and our server took our drink order within a few minutes of getting to the table...good start so far. Well that is where the good experience ended. As the server asked if we have been to a Maggiano's before we answered yes, and that we knew what we would like to order. She (server) decided to read line by line every, and I mean every item on the menu like we have never been to the restaurant before. Once that was completed we put in our order of starters and our dinner choices. One of our starters game, then 5 mins later our second starter game. Within 2 minutes of our second starter hitting the tables both of my children's meals game. So now we are at the table ordered 10 mins ago and have the starters and full meals for our kids at the table. By the time we finished our starters the meals for the kids were cold. They took a few bits and did not like it. After they pushed the meals away we had to wait another 30 mins before my way and I got our meal (we split an item). Our food was cold and tasteless. On top of this the server never brought out a side of meatballs.

The services is horrible and the food is not worth the money."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here! 

They seated us right in the window on the strip. Great view!! Fabulous service!
The food is really good, classic italian. The best in the city? No, but a great place to go, especially if you have friends visiting and staying on the strip and want to meet up with them. They make it really easy, valet right in front of the elevator!

Make a reservation, it gets really busy!
And ask your waitperson for food guidance. They know which way to direct you through the big menu!"}
{"text":"Normally, this restaurant is a must go spot for Italian food in Las Vegas. However this past trip, the sauce of my fetticinni alfredo was super thick and not as tasty as past experiences. My date however had the same dish but with chicken and no issues with the sauce. We also had the arranchini balls that said it had crispy bacon inside but you could barely taste that flavour."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place to eat at during restaurant week. Our server Cameron was very attentive. Great food, great service, nice vibe. Will be coming back here for our next special occasion. Thank you Maggiano's for your hospitality."}
{"text":"OK, so 5 stars might be a bit too generous, but the food is very good at Maggiano's and the service was very good too.  Charlotte's Maggiano's is located on the Sharon Road side of Southpark Mall.   As another review mentioned, the place is loud (almost too loud) and it's also pricey (figure $50 per person if you have drinks).  We at family style and we had too many dishes to mention, but they were all excellent, and the food kept coming all evening.  I estimate that there were two hundred patrons  - the restaurant is huge.  This is a good place for large groups, but not as good if you want a quiet evening.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We had only been to the Maggianos in Chicago, never this location on the Strip.  The place was fantastic and our server Martin was excellent! It has a great atmosphere and friendly staff.  We will certainly be going back....Thank you Martin."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price in a very comfortable setting overlooking the strip."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with this place, but it doesn't seem to understand it's role in cleveland dining. It tried to look an act the part of a fancy italian restaurant. Really, it's just an alright place to grab some italian grub when you're tired of walking around the mall. The good news is that the prices actually reflect this. The buy one dinner take a second home free is a great deal, for example. Service is okay, but I would put the restaurant as a whole on a similar level to Friday's or Pizzeria Uno. Just another well done chain.

If you really want some nice, genuine, italian cuisine, make the 15 minute drive to Little Italy. Or if you can make the trip down to Independence, there's a place called LockKeepers that will absolutely blow you away."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian place in vegas... never disappointed, always too stuffed when we're leaving!"}
{"text":"We went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style.  

The last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to 1-2 items per category.  

So you get to chose 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 pastas and 2 desserts for $23 per person (it use to be 2 for each I believe - my aunt was really disappointed).

They come out with the first plate and if you want more, you order 2nd or 3rd's according to how many people want extra.  (They do allow for you to take things home but they've become quite strict on finishing the first plate first).  

They do have gluten-free penne pasta so I was able to eat that.  

We ordered the caesar salad, calamari, clams and linguine, gluten free baked ziti, tiramisu, and the double fudge brownie.

The salad was a huge let down - the lettuce was super soggy.
The calamari was awesome, light batter and fried to perfection.
Everyone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better.
The baked ziti had sausage in it and I usually love sausage but I didn't care for theres.  
The tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries.  My nephew and I had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie.

It was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up.  Our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the food and wine were very good, and we got a great server as well! Was able to make an online reservation through Open Table for five people 30 minutes ahead of time on a Friday evening, which was awesome."}
{"text":"The place has a nice atmosphere and the vibe is very down to earth yet classy.  The people who work there from banquets to bartenders to servers and bussers all provide first class service.

Now for the part that only gets them 3 stars,  the food.  It is stuck in the 70's.  Presented well but not what I would call modern Italian food or Italia.  TO say it is the Taco bell of Mexican food would put the menu into perspective.  Very much for the simple palate.

Again, though, I have to reiterate the service was world class!"}
{"text":"More than 1 1/2 to get our entrees!! It's a plate of spaghetti!!! And if it was worth it I would definitely not be complaining ..  nothing is worse than waiting forever and the food ends up flavorless
Will not return - 2 hours of my life will not get back"}
{"text":"As soon as my aunt, mom and myself sat down my mom told me that something was spilled by the last guest which made her shoes all sticky. That was such a turn off. It took a good 10 minutes to clean it up before my mom could sit down. After that fiasco was over, we ordered a few dishes to share. Started with the CAPRESE SALAD, and had the LINGUINE & CLAMS/ PRIME DELMONICO STEAK for our main course. All of the dishes were great, and perfect for the 3 of us to share. I'd hope that the restaurant makes sure each table to clean before seating new guests. Because the food was good, I'd definitely come back again and possibly change my review. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I had been to Maggiano's in CA a few times and was not a fan.  When a group of friends decided to try this one for our holiday party I went along with the group.  We started with a chopped salad which was really delicious, however the mozzarella marinara was like a hockey puck.  We ordered eggplant parmigiana which had way too much sauce and baked ziti which was passable.  The best part of the whole meal was the Warm Apple Crostada.  Unfortunately this visit has not changed my opinion of Maggiano's"}
{"text":"Daughter had a birthday with a party of twenty, Unfortunately we had to make a reservation at 8:00pm. Couldn't get us in early, not that big of a deal. Waiter was a little impatient, at times he was a little short with some of us. Menu was very large, however hard to understand. We had to ask a lot of questions regarding some of the items. I do like the Marcos Meal. It's a meal for two, you get a starter appetizer or two salads, two entrees, and a dessert. You also get to choose two entrees to take home. A great deal for about $45.00.
I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, I wasn't that impress with it. The chicken was good, but didn't like the idea of green beans in the meal? The Alfredo sauce could have been better also. I asked for Angel Hair spaghetti to take home. Well when I got home and checked, it was just regular spaghetti. However eating it the next day, it was very good. There was a few people in the party that complained about the marinara sauce was to sweet? I thought it was fine. Overall the meal was OK, not that great! Especially on how much some of the meal are, you would think it would have been better. 
Would I come back? Yes, since my daughter loves this place. However there are better Italian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the atmosphere was great, staff was attentive but our server not so much. The food was mediocre and it was a bit too sweet for my liking. It reminded me of Olive Garden but nicer but I prefer the food over there than here in my opinion. We did the Marco's special where you get an appetizer, two meals, desert and get 2 to go meals. We had to flag our server to get us our check and desert and when he did he told us goodbye and have a good night but failed to give us our to go meals. We had to ask the hostess to get it for us because he was too busy. I probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and had dinner here, there was no wait, the waiter had a sense of humor and always asked twice if we needed anything and if we were sure. I love love love Maggiano's!! Their pastas are to die for, espeically the Rigatoni \"D\" and Chicken Pesto Linguine. 

The entire restaurant was a bit dark, but it sure did make dinner feel relaxing. I would recommend dressing business casual as this is on the Strip, and to bring an appetite as well. YUMMMM.

The breakdown:

{"text":"I always loved going to Maggiano's while living in LA. I have to say my most recent visit  to the LV location will probably be my last. Reservations are a must, but the bar, reception, and dining areas are always so packed full of pushy people. The wait staff is so stressed out by all the drinks, bread, meals, desserts, and checks that they barely have a minute to be cordial.
I equate Maggiano's with romance-dark setting, big booths, great music and good food. Well, sadly the place has turned into family heaven. There was every age group of child from infant strapped to his dad's chest, to toddlers in strollers parked in the isle, to children throwing tantrums, to teens glued to their iPhones. Sorry to say, just the sights and sounds of all these children during my meal turned my evening into a spectator event rather than a romantic dinner. I suggest keeping the kids with grandma or the babysitter, but probably most of the kids we saw were tourists so I think I will just try my luck at a different Italian restaurant off The Strip."}
{"text":"This place has always matched good food with great service. Im italian and very picky. Maggianos comes close to family made Italian even though it is a chain."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. I was trying to stay away from buffets and this place was conveniently located across the street from our hotel. The host and waitress, not so nice, but the food made up for it. I had to change the time of the reservation time once because we were running late and I guess she didn't like that. The waitress took our order and forgot about us for a while. 
The food was really good, it had a really good taste. It comes in really big portions so you can share or just take the rest home. 
Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I decided to order food to-go today. I liked that I could still order from the Classic Pasta On the House special where you  buy one Classic Pasta, or a specially featured dish, and get a Classic Pasta to take home at no additional charge.  In total, I received 4 dinner specials for around $38.  This is a steal! They even added fresh hot dinner rolls which was very nice.  I really enjoy their pastas. It was very delicious and filling. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"When here for a women's luncheon in a small private banquet room. The place is beautiful and the food was served family style where you pass dishes around the table. We had salmon with herbs, four cheese ravioli, baked ziti and salad."}
{"text":"Delicious food at reasonable prices. We had the bruschetta sampler and it was fabulous - I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! 
Went there to try to have Lunch but Hostess turned down a simple request to seat next to the window because the section is Closed according to her. Sat down and no one even approach us to offer drinks or let us know that someone's going to be with us when there was two women right in front of us doing nothing but Chatting to each other. Waitress finally arrived and was having an issue about being rushed to attend to us when she's not even clocked in! Brought the issue to the manager and he was nice enough to give it an effort to correct the Bad experience that we had! He even said we can seat us at the Closed station and he will send a different server to us but we're already on our way out of the place.
Hope they will not say No! To their guest and try to satisfy them no matter what!
We are locals and  Generous tippers! We could have been regulars if we only got treated Good by the Lunch Staff. Very Sad!"}
{"text":"There are times when lasagna is an actual craving, one that must be satisfied with a tower of pasta holding layers of ricotta and sauce inbetween.  Stepping out of the chain comfort zone of Italian fare, Maggiano's is a breath of fresh air in the pool of Italian restaurants in town.  For those wondering just how pretentious this place is--it is far from it.  This particular location happened to be our first experience with Maggiano's, and it will not be the last.  This location is the youngest in the franchise, boasting a chef that created one of the now signature dishes for the season (being sold in all Maggiano's in the nation) and some serious menu selections.

As a typical Italian restaurant should, the classic pastas are readily available and made to order in case of allergy issues.  I found that quite impressive.  That, on top of in-house fresh pasta for all dishes made our dinner experience even more exciting.  We tried the basics with bruschetta appetizers and their seasonal dessert - lemon tiramisu.

The bruschetta is delicious and such perfect bites that holding back from ordering 10 of each option was difficult. The chef welcomed us to the family with basic tomato, basil, and balsamic reduction bruschetta.  It sounds simple, but the flavor profile and texture was perfect. I didn't leave a single tomato or strand of basil on the plate! The bacon and fig, as well as the shrimp bruschetta is crispy, creamy, and perfect flavor combinations that I wanted to order more. However, lasagna and lighter fare fettuccine was on the way.

The lighter fare fettuccine was creamy, with fresh, thick noodles, crisp asparagus, and grilled chicken.  I used a spoon to eat the sauce like soup after my plate was cleared of everything else.  The lasagna is the perfect portion and is the best lasagna I ever had in town.  I didn't want either one to end, and once we left our plates scraped of all goodness, I was sad that the main course was over.

Then, we ordered dessert. The Make a Wish foundation donation with dessert justified ordering another after swallowing the first one.  Their tiramisu is light, and the lady fingers soaked in limoncello and raspberry is absolute heaven.  I suggest you order one dessert per person, because sharing did not go over well.  After the second order, I was finally satisfied.  

Along with impeccable service (thank you, Maggie!) and such an open arms welcome from kitchen to front entrance, Maggiano's is a place that isn't just for a random date night, but a restaurant now added to my go-to's for Italian fare, and a place I feel is a new home.  With such a welcoming and caring restaurant vibe, it's no wonder the food tastes as amazing as it is.  It's made with love.

Stop looking around Yelp and get over to Maggiano's near you."}
{"text":"Food was greeat and the added surprise was that we got a matching pasta dish to take home that was included in the price. Yum. I'd got there again ina minute."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Maggiano's I've been too. 

I've been to the California location, as well as the Washington D.C location, and this one takes the cake.

My boyfriend and I make a 2 week trip to Vegas every summer. This past year, we decided to dine at Maggiano's afters having a good experience in CALI. The food here is SOOOOOO good, we ended up dining here 5 more times before we left. 

I recommend going with a group of 4 or more, because they have great \"package deals\" for larger parties. You can choose between 3 different price groups, all that come with different options, which are all reasonable and well worth the money. 

I'm absolutely gaga (No lady, stay out of this one) over their Chicken Francese and their mash potatoes. To DIE! Their Chicken Francese is not traditional, however. It is breaded and then smothered in lemon sauce. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Did I mention they don't stop bringing more food until you tell them too? GO HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"Service was decent, food was yummy. I shared a kids pepperoni pizza with my little one since it's the same as the adult portion except for some reason there's no pepperoni pizza in the adult menu and that's what I wanted. We also had plain spaghetti with butter no sauce and Cesar salad. All delish! The Sangria was very tasty also. My fiance had creme brûlée for dessert and was amazing. Family friendly restaurant which I loved. They have a ladies bathroom, men's bathroom and a family bathroom. How often do you see that in a nice restaurant?. We're definitely coming back I know there are others closer to home. Oh and prices are definitely fair for quality of food and service."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Restaurant has only been open for a week.... service and food were terrific. My wife made a special request and the Chef personally came out to make sure he would get it right. Very nice touch. Chicken Marsala was excellent and my wife's gluten free chicken piccata was just as she requested. I would strongly recommend you give this new restaurant a shot....you will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I actually find it insane that i'm giving a Maggiano's 4 stars but it happens i guess.

This is definitely not fine dining unless you are part of the applebees, red lobster, sizzler crowd.   Not to say the food is bad, it's either good or pedestrian depending on which side of the fence you are on.

The reason why i'm giving this place such a high score is because the service was extremely good.  The food was decent but too salty."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional, the staff was very friendly and helpful our waitress went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable and we were a party of 15! They surprised us for Mother's Day by having the chief bring the whole table a tasty build your own bruschetta what a wonderful tasty appetizer that was. I wouldn't hesitate to honestly recommend Maggiano's ti anyone! Thank you for making smothers so special, continue the great work!"}
{"text":"I was impressed when I heard this was a chain restaurant. Usually corporate run places are full of bad service and mediocre food. We went to the location in downtown Summerlin. It was a late date night and the restaurant wasn't super busy at all. We sat in the lounge at the bar. They have a vast wine selection and offer a variety by the glass. Their tequila options are limited, however. 

Our bartender/servers name was Nate. He was super knowledgeable About the food menu and gave some great recommendations. He was also friendly and attentive. 

I didn't order anything because I'm vegan... and this place isn't super friendly to my lifestyle. They do have veggie sides of spinach, asparagus, and roasted veggies. The traditional bruschetta can also be vegan without the cheese. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi and sausage with peppers. He loved it but mentioned it was really heavy and rich. Will we return? Absolutely! Perfect spot for a quiet date night:)"}
{"text":"We just had our wedding reception here and I am astonished at the level of service we received.  It was perfect.  The banquet team did an amazing job meeting our specifications for a 60+ person wedding.  Everything was top notch.  I am vegan and they made sure we were taken care of with my special diet."}
{"text":"Best Italian Restaurant on the strip! Our server, Gary, was fabulous! My husband ordered the surf and turf and everything was perfectly cooked. My chopped salad was huge for an appetizer and the muscles were delicious! I would definitely make an effort to come back next time were in Vegas! Thank you Gary for the great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Italian-Americans are a weird bunch on the whole. Everyone has a family recipe for some type of dish that's 'the absolute best they've ever had'.
It's true.
\"Nobody can make sausage or meatballs like mama, or, her vodka gravy for that matter.\"
Yeah, Yeah, heard it all before.

Well I've got news for you's people.
Short of taking a trip to Philly's Little Italy section, you're not going to find a better chain serving Italian anywhere.

It may not be like your mom's, but then you also won't have your mom giving you shit for the hour and a half you're at her home, while she makes you a plate of pasta and braciole. See, that's the payoff for good Italian. Getting a fucking lecture on how your wife \"can't do anything right\" and how you should have married the DeLuca girl from down the block. 

Service is good. Ambiance is well above average. 
It's a huge building with lots of people to stare at, despite mama telling you not to do so.
She also told you to teach your wife to cook if you weren't going to marry an Italian which is why you're here to begin with.
Fucking mama.
She's always right."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time. It has turned into a nice Olive Garden. No offense Olive Garden at least I know what to expect when I go there. Our server was a total joke. Skinny bald guy. I let the manager know his service sucked too FYI management. He would not show up for long stretches of time after dropping food. He would ask half the table if they needed something like desert then forget about the other half of the table. Had to ask for bread for the 3 year old 3 times. Give me a break. I had stop him to tell him my wife and 98 year old grandmother wanted to order desert. On top of it all I got home and realized that he never brought out my to go order. . Lame. That's why I don't eat there very much anymore. Better options."}
{"text":"I only gave one star for the server he was great!
We arrived for our valentines reservation. Our server was very nice. Unfortunately we waited over an hour for our food, then we were informed by our server that our food had been given to another table and eaten. The manager came and apologized and 10 minutes later our food came. My plate was missing the meatballs so they took it back to fix it. While I was waiting for my plate I tasted my husbands and it was horrible. Very bland and the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. When they finally brought my plate I felt so sick from eating that shrimp we just said never mind and ended up leaving. The manager took care of the bill( which he should have) and gave us a free dessert. It was so very disappointing on Valentine's Day"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here and it was very good.  Good atmosphere (a touch loud for my Dad).   Excellent, prompt, professional service.   Food was good, large portions.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Together they offer gluten-free pasta. The waite staff is  fast efficient, very friendly and make you feel right at home. We had veal piccata seasoed nvery nicely to perfection. Very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"We come here all the time from business events, catering, and family dinners. Family style dinners are the absolute best. Feeling like a home dinner without all the cooking at home :) the hospitality is always on point. And the lemon cookies will go fast, get a container when you can!"}
{"text":"You can't beat their buy one take one lunch special. The food is yummy, and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I like Maggiano's where ever I go, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Woodland Hills. They are pretty consistent except sometimes takes a little while to get the main course. Otherwise its great and to much food."}
{"text":"A Christmas Eve family tradition. Food and service were on point. Made a reservation on Open sTable. Requested a table next the window. Got a spectacular table next to the window. Our server Paulo was terrific. Great personality. Excellent service. Just a great night. He even took out picture and a selfie. Fun times."}
{"text":"We are locals & visit Maggianos regularly. The food is always great. We love the location & the atmosphere. Nicely priced also."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain, but the food is ALWAYS delicious. I love every shrimp dish they offer. The traditional Italian dishes are average, but my hubby loves them.

Service can be hit or miss. I just love the quality of food enough to forgive the occasional semi-bad waiter. (forgetful, have to ask multiple times for one thing) not a biggie."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant but last couple times wasn't that great service was mediocre but the food still good. Last time I was there for lunch after 1 pm it wasn't busy at all few customers and there was no one at the reception desk we waited around 10 minutes then she came got us our table then we waited over 10 min for the server. Silverware wasn't clean and the forks were bent and the smell was disgusting. I won't go again. But will still go to another maggiano's somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great chef! He came out to our table to double check my order to ensure he didn't use any ingredient I am allergic to. Very thoughtful and caring. On top of that, the pasta is made fresh! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was fine.  Not what I would have expected elsewhere, but for the Strip, it was good.  I thought my veal was pretty dry, but most others with me were all happy with what they got even if over-priced.

I would give a three, if not for the tourist \"sell you pictures\".  They claim to be fine dining, upscale, etc.  It may be on the Strip, but when paying for a nice dinner I don't need someone taking pictures and then trying to sell them back to me like I'm in an amusement park.  Plenty of other places I can be pestered for that, and not real happy being bothered in the middle of a dinner. I should have saved a few bucks and gone to Outback.

They really need to decide if they want to be sub-par and pester, or be the fine dining place they claim to be. My wife got the surf and turf, around $50.  We'll not be stopping here on future visits, to pay that, so we can be offered to buy a picture.  Crazy.

Service was ok.  Nothing special, but nothing real bad either.  Other than the camera girl running around."}
{"text":"If six stars was an option, I'd give them. While Maggiano's is known for being able to seat and serve large parties, we really put them to the test with a party of 23 (in the dining room, not the banquet rooms). After a dismal dinner experience somewhere else the previous night we were all a bit worried about timeliness and quality of serving such a large party. 

Turns out we had nothing to worry about. Brian - the manager on duty - calmly took charge of our large hungry and thirsty crowd. All of our meals were served together, hot, and 100% correct. Out server was outstanding - our wine glasses never went empty. A plethora of additional serving staff jumped in and helped deliver dinners, extra bread, and top off water glasses. 

Guys and girls - our biggest thanks to all of you for making our dinner experience pleasurable and memorable!"}
{"text":"Standard American Italian  fare+checkered table clothes+piped in Sinatra playing in the background, = pretty safe and predictable dinner.  About what you'd expect from a corporation like Brinker."}
{"text":"We sat outside. View was very nice. 

Food portions are HUGE. A half order is enough for one person. A full order is for people who want to share. 

I ordered a special, Chianti Beef, it was a little salty for my taste but my brother said it was great. I tasted some of his Garlic Shrimp Linguine, which was good but the noodles lacked flavor. I also tasted some of my mom's Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta which was the best in my opinion. It was full of flavor, but not too much. My family did critcize that the noodles were a little overcooked though, but I found it perfect. i guess it depends on your preference and how you like your noodles. Now i saved the best for last, I would honestly go to Maggiano's just for their garlic mashed potatoes. 

I have ever only really tasted two chef's mashed potatoes that i liked previous to this dish, but this is definitely in my top 2. It's hard to describe, but you just have to taste it. It's the perfect blend of ingredients, not too salty, good consistency, just try it! I'd seriously go all the way to San Jose from SF just to eat the mashed potatoes. 

Food took a little long to be prepared. Service was pretty good. Our waters got refilled, but nothing extremely special or eyecatching."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant a 3 star due to the fact that they precook their pasta in the morning. Seriously what Italian wants to eat pre-cooked food. Our appetizers were breaded zucchini and flat bread with sauce and cheese. They were delicious!! We were so excited for the main course to arrive. What a disappointment. The spaghetti was so overcooked it was mush, the eggplant parmigiana was so dry, the Gnocchi was all mush. Very little of the main courses were eaten. The waitress did feel bad cause she had told us it is fresh cooked to order. Some was removed from our bill. We were of course hungry so we ordered the dessert sampler and they were all delicious and big sized for samples. We would not return to this restaurant for a main course."}
{"text":"Large portions, good service.  A little expensive, if you're not ordering the pasta.  But the food is always good."}
{"text":"My husband I love this place, the food was excellent. My husband had Beef Contadina and I had Veal Piccato. Very delicious indeed. Beautiful atmosphere and a perfect restaurant for a dinner date We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fiancé and I had a very enjoyable experience here last night on the patio. We work a lot ...and both of us are actually in the restaurant industry. So we appreciate great food and service. Everything we ordered was delicious. I had the four cheese ravioli with a pesto cream sauce. Only thing I thought was a bit much was the glass of decoy cab was $21. Stephanie our server was professional and friendly. We really liked her! She invited us back for their brunch. Will return!! :)"}
{"text":"Terrible slow service. Food is basic.. the restaurant was almost empty mid day at lunch. They definitely need to focus on their patrons more."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here-it's a reliable chain that has constantly good food even though the calorie counts were just posted on menus.  Yeah, that last part was unrelated, but still makes me mad.

My mom and I each got a glass of wine at lunch, then I got the margherita flat bread and creamy chicken soup and she, a flatbread with BBQ sauce.  The soup was creamy but not too filling and our flatbreads (only 650-700 calories each!!) were light and delish.  Our waitress was chatty but not too solicitous, and approved of our choice of the dessert sampler.  My favorites were the creme brulee and apple strudel, and my mom loved the tiramisu.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry, but I could not complain about one single aspect of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! First time in Vegas and wanted to get some good Italian food. I'm a customer for life now! The food was amazinnnggg and the waiter we had was so nice! He comped our drinks and gave us free cookies at the end. I love this restaurant. You won't be disappointed. The environment is nice and it is a very classy place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I have visited this Maggiano's location several times and have had nothing but great food and service. Until yesterday (6/17/18), this was one of my family's favorite places to eat out. Something has changed drastically in the level of service AND the quality of food....at least at the South Park location in charlotte, NC on Father's Day 2018. I arrived with reservations for a party of 7 and still had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. No table was ready. When we inquired about how long we'd have to wait, the hostess, who I assumed was the Lead or Supervisor because she wore a headset, seemed irritated and very passive as she responded without even looking at us and immediately directed her attention to another group that had just come it to be added to the waitlist. Since it was Father's Day, we decided to wait instead of trying to find another restaurant that wasn't crowded. During our wait, a child vomited in the waiting area. I alerted the assumed Lead hostess that a clean-up was needed. She directed a second hostess to clean it. That second hostess used her headset to call a third person to clean it up. As we continued to wait, no one came to clean up the vomit and several customers unknowingly walked through it. About 20 minutes passed and we were still waiting to be seated. I approached that second hostess who had been directed to clean up the vomit that it was still there and that customers were walking through it. She called again to the back but no one came. By the time my party was seated, the vomit was gone but only because so many customers had walked though it.

A third hostess seated our group. She was very impersonal and also spoke to us without any eye contact. I had to ask her if she was speaking to me and if we should follow her to a table. I felt disregarded and like I was an inconvenience to all three hostesses we encountered during our visit.

Once we were seated, our waiter was really the first of the entire Maggiano's staff to smile and serve. He took time to answer our questions and was very attentive to our group. Even with the food coming out slow, he made sure to acknowledge us each time he passed our table whether he was waiting on us or not. 

I do plan to visit this location to speak to the on-site Manager as I don't believe this review will make it to their eyes. Four our party of 7, our bill was just under $300. If I had been paying, I would never have stayed. I can't say that I will visit Maggiano's any time soon....not even with gift certificates or coupons. This was just unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Maggiano's with my boyfriend, sister, and parents over the weekend for Mother's Day. It was very packed, however the service we received made up for it. I wish I could remember our waitress' name but I can't. She was petite, with very short black hair (like Julie Andrews.) I don't think I've ever had a waitress be so kind, and attentive. This woman went above and beyond and I'm honestly SHOCKED that she is not a manager, or even an owner of a restaurant. My family is definitely not the easiest to deal with either, and she was still kind regardless of their difficult requests. I never write yelp reviews but I felt like I had to because I was so incredibly impressed. As someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, I understand how difficult it can be. This black-haired Julie Andrews waitress deserves the highest of recognition. Thank you maggiano's"}
{"text":"Five stars alone for Daniel, our server. If I could add more, I totally would. We always have a great experience anytime we dine at Maggiano's, but today stood out because of the service alone. He just went above and beyond.

As for the food, you can never go wrong with the zucchini frittés and the Chicken Marsala - which is hands down the best Marsala you will ever eat!

For dessert the butter cake is a must!"}
{"text":"Despite my previous experiences with Maggiano's in San Jose, I particularly enjoyed my Maggiano's experience in Las Vegas.  The bar here was just as high as my first experience back in San Jose.  We were here for my buddy's birthday and we had well over twenty people with us.  The staff pulled out all the stops to make sure we were well taken care of.  The food was like a flowing river of endless plates and our waiters did an excellent job of keeping us entertained.  Since Las Vegas has been a regular stop for my friends and I as of late, I would definitely come back here to re-live the experience.  Food recommendations: Everything!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  The food is very good, the service isn't bad.  Plus the $10.00 off coupon for joining their eclub isn't bad either. This place will always have a special place in my heart, because this is where I took my wife on our first date."}
{"text":"Place is nice. Food is good, and their portions are more than enough. Server was super chill and engaging. Will come back and try the other stuff. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to go to Maggianos when our fridge is a bit empty. We always get the Marcos Meal for two $39.95. You get any appetizer, two Classic pastas a dessert and two additional classic pastas to take home.

To start I had the peach flavored ice tea. Highly recommended. I expected some weakly flavored tea but this was really very good. A bit on the sweet side but I like it.

They serve some rolls before dinner with evoo and balsamic. Good bread rolls!

For our appetizer we had the crab cakes, which are normally $14.95 by itself. Two nice sized crab cakes with a small mound of arugula and grape tomatoes as a little salad. Very good.

Our eat in entree I had spaghetti and meatball. I know kinda boring but a large bowl and large meatball to boot. Well cooked pasta al dente and I couldn't finish it all more to take home. 

The wife had the mushroom ravioli which she liked but couldn't finish. More leftovers.

We finished with the cheesecake. Excellent by the way. Large piece with strawberries and a strawberry sauce with whipped cream. Would have taken some home but we forced ourselves to eat it all. Yum!

To top it off we got our take home meals to go and the wife had a $10 coupon from them. They are almost paying us to eat here. 

We will be back when the fridge empties again!"}
{"text":"We thought the food that Maggiano's was very very good. Both my wife and I thought the sauce was excellent and the best we've had in sometime. But the service left something to be desired. Although when we brought the subject to the attention of the manager he corrected the situation promptly overall we give the restaurant a good rating and we do plan on going back again"}
{"text":"Oh Maggiano's what has happened to you?   I've dined here for years and i have my favorite entrees.   I can't believe what I'm experiencing as i sit here.   Using FAKE bacon crumbles in your amazing chopped salad, WHY???  My eggplant parmigiano skin all over it and the dish was clearly premade!  Is this what we've degraded ourselves to in order to pump out all the take home meals??

RIP Maggiano's, you're dead to me now."}
{"text":"I am continually disappointed with their seafood pastas.  I don't eat meat but my husband does and he is very happy with their meats and sauces.  But, he did have their baked ziti and was very disappointed.  Just a little cheese on top and watery gravy (red sauce) on the bottom. All of my seafood pasta choices have come out exactly the same.  One dish is described as shrimp Fra Diavolo with spicy tomato sauce - nope it was pink, watery like broth and no spice,  Another was the shrimp scampi - nope pink, watery, tasteless and shrimp were slightly overdone.  Another choice linguini di Mare - pink, watery, tasteless sauce with overcooked seafood.  I loved the Maggianos on the Strip and the one near SouthCoast Plaza in CA.  Someone needs a lot of instruction on the seafood side of the kitchen.  The restaurant is beautiful and the service is great.   I want them to succeed but the have to be able to manage basic sauces and there is no greater sin in Italian cooking then watery, tasteless sauces."}
{"text":"I am torn on how to review Maggianos. I went to the one in Cincinnati before and had an awful experience, though the food was great. Maggiano's actually did a great job of reaching out to me about my bad experience. So, I thought I would try them again, this time in Cleveland.  The food again was fantastic. The ambiance was great. However, the service was pretty bad again. We gave our drink order, then waited almost 30 minutes for our drinks to come and to be able to order. We were told by another waiter that the bar was slow. We ended up grabbing a third waiter who went and got the drinks. Mine was ready, my dates was not, the waiter, despite having suggested the drink, forgot to put her drink order in. Eventually we got the drinks and got to order. At the end of the meal we ordered another round of drinks. The waiter got the drink wrong and it had to be remade.  Then, our meals came with to-go pasta but we never received it. It may be that I have just had two bad experiences with service that are not a representation of the typical service, and the food was phenomenal, though as someone who often takes clients to entertain out to eat, if you have any type of important date or client meeting I am not sure if I would chance the service. 

5 stars for food. 1-2 for service."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the waiter forced me to \"select\" the percent of tips (which is pre-calculated after tax) I \"want to\" give and claimed it's to save my time.

I understand sometimes tourists don't give enough tips but this is not right and it just totally ruined the good dinner.

I'm from SF, not exactly a tourist but I'm an Asian, so I'm not surprised I was treated that way, it's just very disappointing."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is home to the American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer corporate kickoff breakfast and thank you reception. Their catering and special events staff rolls out the red carpet every single time. They go above and beyond to accommodate every request. Our guests always feel welcomed and well cared for. The dining area is always noticeably well put together and special events room is elegant yet comfortable. We always experience great service and attentive wait staff. We often show up hours early and they are quick to offer beverages even prior to everything being set up. Jose was our banquet captain and he went so far as to set up our audio and visual equipment while simultaneously problem solving our tipping table center pieces!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food is always tasty. My mushroom ravioli was delicious and my mom had their chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it was mediocre. One thing I did love was this fruity soda they had. Very fresh and tasty. Our server was okay, she looked like she was in a rush the whole time. Either than that everything was fine. We had a really good table next to the windows so I loved that."}
{"text":"1st time here. Had stuffed mushrooms which were very good. Had veal parmigiana with a side of spaghetti. Creme Brûlée for desert. I had a good meal.

6/2. Came back tonight had shrimp scampi which was out of this world. Creme Brûlée for desert"}
{"text":"This place is amazing .. My husband and I went there for a dinner date and it was magical ..the staff was really friendly ...and the food was delicious and in huge portions ...i couldn't finish my pasta (( and i'm an eater )) hehehe..i just love it."}
{"text":"Wow, we got lucky.  No wait.  Quick service.  In and out in less than an hour.  As always excellent food."}
{"text":"For years our friends have invited us to go here. The stars aligned and we went with a group of 7. We ate family style so we could try a variety of dishes. Totally worth it. 

I can't eat shrimp but many in our group wanted a shrimp dish so they made a special small portion Sans shrimp just for me! This was especially nice as I think it was the tastiest dish.

The consensus on the fried zucchini was that it was too lemony. Everything else was amazing! Get some friends and go!"}
{"text":"We tried Maggiano's for my birthday, and I've got to say that they don't disappoint as far as the deliciousness of their meals go. The decor in the restaurant looks nice, but the it is a little cramped in the hallways. The employees looked well dressed and clean, and also very friendly. I do have one complaint though. The waiter who boxed our food to go forgot to put the pasta in the box. It's a minor mistake, but my boyfriend was really upset to come home to his incomplete meal that he paid $30 for. Maggiano's price is not the highest in town, but it is higher than an average Italian restaurant. Granted they have higher than average tasting meal, but I'd at least expect them to at least remember something as important as pasta. All in all, I'd still come back because their food tasted wonderful. The veal was really tender, and so flavorful that you can taste immediately without even chewing. Keep it up, Chefs!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 more like it. 
They put lots of food on the plates, it's just that it's really nothing too special. The best of the lot we tried were the mussels, and the side spinach salad was okay as well. 
As for the veal picata, or the crab cakes...would  pass on them. 
Wines in the limited selection are reasonably priced. 
Along with the large portions, prices are reasonable.. and that keeps the place packed with patrons... reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Last night a group of my friends met at Maggiano's for dinner.  We made reservation for 9 and I'm so glad that we did.  This place was packed for Friday night.  After I informed the host of my party's arrival, she informed me that we would have to order from the Family Style menu since our group now consisted of 10 people.  It was a last minute addition.  I was annoyed by that because I wasn't aware of that policy.  I got nervous because I wasn't sure how it was going to work out since we had vegetarians in the group and some of the ladies were set on what they wanted to eat.  Nonetheless, we decided to order from the Classic Family Menu list which costs $27.95 per adult, drinks were not included.  The Classic includes two appetizers, two salads, four entrees and two desserts.  And that was more than enough for 10 hungry women. 

To make ordering easier, we ordered by a show of hands and the dish with the most votes would make it to the table. For starters we ordered the Barb's Spinach and Artichoke Al Forno (YUMMY) and Bruschetta.  For salads, we had the Italian tossed and Maggiano's Salad.  For the main dishes, we grubbed on the Linguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce (YUM), Mom's Lasagna (YUM, YUM), Four Cheese Ravioli and Salmon Lemon and Herbs. And for the delight of the night, we finished off with the Chocolate Zuccotto Cake and Nonna's Pound Cake, Caramelized Bananas (MY FAV).

Daniel was our server and he was great.  Though he brought me the wrong drink, I didn't whine about that. He was friendly, on point and funny."}
{"text":"I've always been a pretty huge big fan of Maggianos just because I simply love Italian Food! It's definitely #1 on my favorite types of foods to eat.. I was asked out to a I guess you could call a date for brunch lol so I had the pleasure of course selecting a spot . Now because this was going to be on someone else's dime I decided to think outside of the box and try something completely different. I can't be the only one who didn't even know that Maggianos has a damn brunch! Where the hell have I been? I signed up for email alerts and somewhere amongst the rest of the junk mail was a nice reminder that Maggianos has a brunch! Now when I think brunch I automatically think bottomless mimosas, Bellini's and Bloody Mary's! Now don't get too excited because they actually don't offer bottomless however what they do offer is a pitcher which is just as good .. I think? On to the food: 

Crab Cake Benedict ($19.95) - 5/5 Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, English Muffin, Poached Eggs, Hollandaise Sauce. 

Italian Sausage Frittata ($13.95) - 4/5 Spinach, Smoked Mozzarella, Crispy Vesuivo.

Overall everything was amazing and my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our dishes as well as the customer service from our server! It's always exciting to find a new place to do brunch and go in knowing that you will leave completely satisfied! Awesome job to the downtown Summerlin Maggianos team!"}
{"text":"I loveeeed this place I went to the one at the Fashion show mall for a date night with my husband we got window view of the strip and I just loved the atmosphere of the restaurant dim lights and AMAZING service (I recommended a friend here and she celebrated her anniversary and her and her husband also raved about the great customer service) the food was also delicious, Everything was as my husband would say A1!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! move over BUCA this place is my jam! I got the chicken parm and I was so impressed, it's honestly the best I've had! My boys got the children's flat bread pizza, I had to order two because they loved it so much! It's such a nice restaurant with so many delicious options and the service we had that night was great! Ok but honestly it's the dessert that just bumped this place to 5 stars! The butter cake!!!!!! OMG don't even think about it! Just get it!!!!!! I could have eaten 5!!!!! It's so good! The lemon cookies are so light and sweet. Just perfect. Can't wait to be back when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our daughters 21 birthday. This was a big deal for us and we had the entire family in tow.  Had a reservation for 11 at 7:30 PM. Called in the afternoon to see if we could move up to 7 which they were able to accommodate. Got there and the atmosphere is great. Just a couple minutes and they seated us. Food was family style and amazing. I can't even remember all the courses but there was sublime mozzarella cheese, artichoke dip and bread for appetizers, sirloin, chicken, lasagna and Alfredo and amazing dessert apple frittata was crazy. The waitress was fantastic, completely attentive and helpful in her suggestions. One down was table was in close to other patrons, bumping chairs issue. Probably because we moved up our reservation. One person at the table next to us was total rude jerk (I paraphrase for this review) toward my daughter which came close to ruining the evening, but that wasn't totally restaurants fault. Managers stepped in and gave us a private room to be sure the rest of our night was perfect. This place is top notch, don't hesitate to let management know if you have special request. They're very cool and want to make your experience the best it can be."}
{"text":"The ambiance is more pleasant then the food they serve. If you are looking for a fancier Olive Garden, then you came to the right place."}
{"text":"Saturday night so no surprise: it was busy busy busy. Still, our waiter hustled and did a great job. 

We had the four cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce and the clam linguini and both were excellent. The portions are large. We also had a salad and spinach side, also very good. The sourdough bread was also particularly good; fresh and warm with the perfect amount of saltiness. 

We have been here before we will come here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I have never had bad food here.  I would highly recommend this place if you live Italian food."}
{"text":"My daughter brought me here tonight for Mother's Day. From start to finish, everything was perfect! Martin was our server & very attentive. Chef Heiki(sp?) was on point tonight(it was nice meeting you, Chef!) I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times before and we always had a good meal and service.  Today was another story.  First off they do not have many options for gluten free choices.   We also observed that not only us but many of the customers were not being served any food in a reasonable time.  When we did get our meal I asked the server if the pasta was made fresh, she really didn't know.  I found that interesting.    The food was hot and my spaghetti was very good . The gluten free noodle they use was just ok.  There are good gluten free pasta options on the market now.  Won't be in a big hurry to go back there soon."}
{"text":"Great location and awesome service. Went here on a friday night after shopping with my family, had an amazing server Nathan! Please if you ever come here ask for Nathan, he took real good care of us and was really helpful! Thank you so much, will definitely be coming back here again! 10/10"}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience. It took almost three hours to get our food and it came out cold and coagulated. First the appetizer was very late \"because it was burned\" and needed to be remade. We watched numerous tables come and go, with our food never arriving. It was so hot upstairs, we sweat through our clothes. Nothing was done to cool the section off.

When the manager arrived, they tried to make things right, but the screwed up remaking our order, gave us the wrong to go dessert, and two people in our group went home with some other table's half eaten left overs! Disgusting. 

I used to think highly of Maggianos, but their service and quality have fallen apart. Never going back."}
{"text":"I got takeout from here one day, and it WAS delicious! I had the lasagna, garlic bread and, zucchini, I think. I will definitely be back for more. It would be a great place to go with family or friends, also. The atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before 10pm to meet my family for dinner and the doors were locked. The staff could clearly see I was alone and had family already in the restaurant seated yet they didn't open the door for me, which I felt was rude. Once I managed to get inside, the place is very nice, romantic, dimly lit and elegant. The bread and olive oil is very good, the service was attentive given it was a quiet late Thursday night. We ordered the light fettuccini Alfredo and chicken Cesar Salad. Both were good, not great, the portions are generous and the staff once inside were polite and attentive. I would go back to try other things as it was a pretty pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Great service, great food
Didn't have ranch dressing which I thought is a must have for every restaurant in North America but maybe I'm wrong"}
{"text":"Service was truly forgettable. Waiter came by to take drink order, food order and once to check on the party and that was it. Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, food another 30, had to flag waiter down to get another glass of wine (40 minutes later it arrived), never asked if we wanted refills on other drinks. After presenting bill and another long wait, she returned the wrong credit card to us, which means she also gave someone else our credit card. Food ok but not returning due to poor service, place has gone downhill recently."}
{"text":"Great food.  Family style is the way to go with a family or group of 4+.  Appetizers - Calamari both ways (Fried and Gluten Free) were great.  Bruschetta is generous as in topping mix.  (Plenty to spread on the house bread they give you)  Main course - Chicken Picatta, Spaghetti with Meatballs, Parmesan crusted Tilapia hit the spot.

Super staff.  Dan was our waiter in the private dining section."}
{"text":"I was there for my birthday, and a couple of us had our birthdays on the same day or weekend, so we thought it'd be cool have our b-day dinner there. 

The food was good. I forgot what I had (No, I wasn't drunk...wait...was I?) but I know it was good and they give good, hearty portions. 

The negatives were how crammed-up the dining area is. I mean, if you're claustrophobic, then this ain't the place for you. You can damn near eat off the next table if you're slick enough. 

The other issue I had was the 2 serenading musicians. Now, they probably didn't mean any harm but after coming to our table, one of them noticed we were all Black and said \"I don't know any rap but I take requests\" - Wow. Did he REALLY just go there? I had to put him in check and told him to keep it movin' before I show him what Gangsta Rap LOOKS like when a violin becomes a weapon. Needless to say...he quickly got out of there. 

Then they misplaced the birthday cake, but later found it...then lost the top that goes over it...then later found it. Yeah, it was one of those nights. 

But the food was good. Maybe a tad bit overrated for the price though, especially in a food-ladened city like Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with my company for about a 100 person dinner. So they gave us a fixed menu. No problem. 

It was 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts. 

The selection was from meatballs to fried eggplant to steak. 

The place is massive and very well maintained. 

The food was just ok. Nothing wrong with it, but maybe because it was such a big party they couldn't really wow us. 

There's so many places in Vegas to eat, so it would be hard to comeback here, until my company hosts the same party here again next year!

The service was actually pretty good. Somebody at my table was lactose intolerant and they were very attentive to his problem. 

They made him his own dish, which or course is very nice."}
{"text":"We came here after a full day of hospitals to have a quiet dinner. The staff was very attentive with my elder and sick grandfather. Chef Alex Lenk came out and offered to purée the food: It made our evening easier and enjoyable. It's great to see the humane and warm side of people - thank you."}
{"text":"First the good. The service was excellent. Our waiter knew the dishes well, was able to suggest the best wine for the meal chosen and he was very attentive throughout the meal. He also made sure that there were no food allergy issues. 

Now, the not so good. The food overall was way below what we were expecting for a restaurant that is considered semi-upscale and quite pricey. We first ordered the Calamari Fritté, Mozzarella Marinara, Stuffed Mushrooms and the Crispy Zucchini Fritté appetizers. The calamari was good but a little too heavy on the breading. The zucchini was also ok. Both were served with dipping sauces that were disappointing. The mozzarella was served as large squares but came out warm, not hot, so the cheese was not runny as we like it. Again, the dipping sauce (in this case a tomato marinara sauce was too heavy and bitter and definitely did not taste \"freshly made\". If it was, they need a new recipe. Finally, the stuffed mushrooms were good, but not great.   Portion sizes were large - no complaints there.

As for the main courses, the veal parmigiana was only ok, not great. The texture of the veal was not consistent from piece to piece. And again, I will bring up the tomato sauce that came with it. It was very bitter, almost like it was overcooked, and tasted too much like a sauce you get out of a jar. The pasta was very well done and was the best part of that dish. The Linguine di Mare was disappointing as the clams were way overcooked and \"meely\" textured. The steak and ravioli special was good, although the ravioli was a little sparse on the seafood stuffing. However, the steak was well cooked. The chicken parmisan was good although it had the same sauce problem as the veal.

I know restaurant reviews are very subjective as everyone's taste is different. To me, it comes down to this. Would I go back for another meal? Taking into account the food quality, the price and considering how many other Italian restaurants there are in Vegas, my answer, in this case, is no."}
{"text":"Don't make a reservation because it doesn't mean anything. We showed up early for our 8:15pm reservation, and they were 45 minutes late seating us. Not very friendly service from the hostesses either. 

Nothing worse than planning a date night and having to wait at the restaurant when you put in a reservation earlier in the day. We had to cancel our plans after dinner. They don't need to have reservations if they don't mean anything. It messed up our schedule for the whole evening."}
{"text":"The food is really good I had the rigatoni D and Chicken picatta it was DELICIOUS. The reason for the 3 stars was the service the waiter was trying really hard but they were super busy it was just to much for him or anyone. But worth a try just make sure to have a reservation upon check in oh and the view is amazing"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food is great...the ambiance is fantastic... The view is superb... The service is state of the art!!!! If you love Italian and want a place that has a classy...but busy...happening feel try Magganio's!"}
{"text":"Predictibility is the key. You can meet friends and business associates here for a wonderful well-prepared Italian dinner and not worry that there might be an off night as there are other places. Maggiano's consistently turns out the best in the healthiest Italian food in town. If you doubt it just walk in and take a Sniff and you'll know. Waitstaff is perfect and so is the hostesses who really care whether you're seated in a timely fashion or not. Love Maleeka (sp)."}
{"text":"To update my bad review, I did finally receive a phone call from Antonio and after talking to him I feel much better about management.  While I'm still upset over what happened, he did everything he could to make up and apologize for everything.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We ate here with a party of 10. The service was great. The food was good. We ordered baked sausage ziti, ravioli, lasagna, and pork chops. It was also a walk away from Ti. They also have a great happy hour for cocktails. I would return to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"6 of us had dinner on April 3rd. Atmosphere and service were excellent. Unfortunately, my wife was the only one who ordered a fresh chopped salad (the rest of us had a cooked meal). 6 hours later she was down with severe food poisoning. Just a reminder of how dangerous it is to eat fresh food in restaurants who hire children with poor hygiene habits and are allowed to handle food."}
{"text":"Horrible service but great food. If you want to eat on time and get served by a happy waitstaff then DONT eat here. But if youre willing to spend $40 on a cold steak and have a rude waitress, this place is perfect for you. Even after we complained to the manager, we only got our desserts compd but not a single apology."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My husband and I went for dinner last night and the tomato soup, mushroom raviolis and sangria were amazing. Bobby was the best server- funny and nice- and helped us celebrate our anniversary. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a little oasis in the desert of Vegas. When you step inside, suddenly, you've left the hustle and bustle of the strip and have a place to simply enjoy the food and the service which were both wonderful. 

Our server that evening was polite and welcoming. It felt like I had a favorite aunt who was there making sure I ate enough because I was too skinny (which I am not lol). We gave her a big tip and she jovially waved good bye to us as we left. 

The food is great here too. The dishes are generously portioned with bold flavors and a great adherence to the heart and soul of traditional italian dishes (or at least their americanized version). Highly recommend taking a trip here if you want a solid dinner at a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday dinner. Made a reservation and was seated promptly upon arrival. Server was nice,  but definitely seemed rushed. 

Complimentary bread and butter / olive oil, which was probably the best part of dinner. 
Got the crab cakes appetizer, which was tasty.  I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions and husband got chicken marsala. My entree was tender and cooked to perfection, and tasted good at first,  if a little monotonous. 

Husband's (birthday boy) entree was a total failure. He asked to substitute the standard spaghetti aglio olio with spaghetti meat sauce,  which didn't happen. The chicken was as tough as shoe leather, the sauce didn't taste at all of marsala wine,  and the mushrooms had hardly any evidence of being cooked.

Considering we were here for his birthday,  it was pretty disappointing. Still, service was nice enough, and location, and cleanliness can't be faulted."}
{"text":"Big, crowded, popular eatery.  Food is good, not great but I'm a food snob.  Girls at reception desk were too busy flirting with guy to greet guests, had to wait several minutes till they finally noticed I was standing there.  Ate at the bar, Jeremy the bartender was fantastic with great service and recommendations."}
{"text":"off to Maggiano's with a party of thirteen.
A very comfortable setting, so it seem.
just a little bit too dim...
which makes a perfect place for a date for her and him,
but an even more perfect for a family dinner.
as we waited to be seated, we got hungrier and hungrier.
we were then told that with parties bigger than eight,
we must do family style even if we each want our own plate.
we talked to the waiter who spoke with the manager,
because of misunderstanding, our own dish... we were able to order.
we had 2 vegetarians in our party,
so the chef actually came and took their orders personally!
i ordered the clam pasta with red sauce,
it was a big portion, even when it is a \"half\" course.
so i split my meal with a friend.
the dish was so delicious, we finished til the very end.
our glasses of water were never empty,
for the waiter always refills it every minute oh so gracefully.
the accordion player in the restaurant was very sweet and nice
a friend spoke with him for a bit and he played her a song without thinking twice
we were also celebrating our friend's birthday,
another song he played for her and must i say,
it was very very lovely...
a great environment for a birthday party.
the price was decent for the big portion of meal,
i have to say, it is a very good deal."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places to eat but I feel like the food has gone down. The positions are huge, so great for sharing. But they started a few yrs back when you buy one of their classic dishes you get to take one for home and now I feel like all the food tastes like it's been made way in advanced and than just heated up, doesn't take fresh or home made like it use to. I no longer go here for dinner but will occasionally stop by for hh. If you sit in their bar area they have a handful of flatbread selections for only $5 and I can get a whole dinner out of it. I hope they change the dinner good quality and I would start going back again..."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.....

This place was pretty damn good. I know it's a chain and I would have thought I would have been to one by now considering they are all over the place in the DMV area. Surprisingly so, I had not and my first visit to a Maggiano's Little Italy in Las Vegas was a pleasant one. When I arrived they had to tap a keg for a Newcastle that I wanted, this was sort of annoying because it felt like forever but I was watching football (and gambling on it) at the time.

Our waitress was a real sweetheart, and she checked on us regularly. I had a few (2) beers before my meal and they didn't seem to mind. The ambiance was really cool, but I could have told it was a chain type restaurant even if I didn't know. 

The food was great. They brought out bread before the meal and we weren't very hungry so I didn't order an appetizer. I had the center cut filet mignon and the person I was with had the salmon salad. We were both very pleased with the overall meal. 

I was very pleased with this chain restaurant and would go back again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was spread too thin for a large table.  And it took a long time for them to bring us our water."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience, food was great, server was exceptional. We had calamari, lasagna, chicken piccata and Shrimp fra diavolo. All were hot, fresh and extremely flavorful"}
{"text":"Last night was the best ever i took my mom to Maggiano's in Scottsdale for her birthday and we both had an amazing night thanks to our server Kenneth. He made my moms night magical and very enjoyable thanks to him for going the extra mile for the amazing service"}
{"text":"Food was very good! I had chicken piccata and hubby had stuffed shells from their holiday menu. The stuffed shells were to die for! Had a frozen Bellini which I would recommend! Will go back next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the place but will never be back. I used their website to order $150 worth of egift certs today. They processed the order - TOOK THE MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT - then sent me an email saying due to their security checks they could not completed my transaction. RIPOFF, SCAM. I called the third party handling the transaction, my refund could take 3 to 5 days. The security checks are for my own good. They stole $150 from me, ripped me off and now it will not be refunded for 3 to 5 days. Sorry great food and great place but you associated yourself with a group of thieves on the web and I will never be in again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Maggiano's and I was really kind of disappointed.  The atmosphere has a strange mix of classy historical decor and casual eating details with a side of tacky gingham table cloths put wrong side up.  I came with a group of 4 other people and we ordered \"family style\" which never seems to work out as well as you want it to.

We ordered fried mozzarella marinara, bruschetta, and the Italian tossed salad as our first course and those were about as expected.  The mozzarella was nicely sized but they were unfortunately drenched in marinara as opposed to having it served on the side.  The bruschetta was very heavy on the tomato and there wasn't much of anything else.  The salad was a salad.  Enough said.

For our four main courses we ordered two pastas, the Gnocchi with Italian Sausage and the Baked Eggplant Parmesan, and two meats, Chicken Caprese and the Peppercorn-Crusted Sirloin - medium.  The gnocchi was creamy and delicious and my only complaint was that there wasn't more.  The baked eggplant was an incredibly disappointing dish though.  Both the pasta and the eggplant were dry and tasteless and looked like it had been sitting in a warmer for the past two hours.  One bite and I was done with that.  The chicken caprese was okay.  Just okay.  A little heavy on the balsamic and a little dry, but okay.  The sirloin was over cooked.  We asked for medium and received a generous medium well but the others seemed to find this one okay.  

For desert we ordered the New York Style Cheesecake and the Crème Brûlée.  The cheesecake was fresh and tasty but not special and could have been mistaken for store-bought if it wasn't already.  Crème Brûlée is by far my favorite desert so when it came out I was disappointed to see that it was very thin and the sugar on top was very thick in its place.  Luckily, both of the deserts were served with strawberries which might have been my favorite part of the whole meal.

Our service was slow and we repeatedly were served things that were not our order, as well as having confusions on our own orders and that it was family style, not individual.

Over all, I left uncomfortably full after trying a bit of everything and didn't feel like the discomfort was worth the calories.  I'd much rather spend my next Italian dining experience elsewhere, even if I only eat a fourth of what I had here."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to go on a date and check this place out. The hostess gave us a buzzer and told us about 30min - 45min wait. (It was a Saturday night so what we expected) about 10 minutes later our buzzer goes off and we are seated. Our server Steven R. was super sweet and funny. My boyfriend order the Mom's Lasagna *he got a take home pasta for free with it as well!!!* so he ordered the Four-Cheese Ravioli; I ordered the Linguine di Mare (I asked for it mild style since I am not a fan of spicy things) Everything we ordered was amazing and perfect! The entire time everyone greeted our table and thanked us for coming in and checking it out. We got a little goodie bag as well which was awesome! We will definitely be coming back and recommending this place!"}
{"text":"We only tried this place because of a big party we will be hosting at the Las Vegas Maggiano's.  We wanted to get a feel of the atmosphere and the food.

We came here on a Sunday night with reservations for two at 7pm.  It took about 15-20 mins to seat us, and those without reservations took about 45 minutes.  The waitress took awhile to get to us, but I can see she was extrememly busy.  

The break down of our order:  one caesar and one maggiano salad;  for the entree; chicken parmesan and shrimp scampi.  Both salads and the dishes were decent, A-OK.

I will not be comming back here, everything was okay but not good enough for me to come back to.  The Las Vegas venue has higher ratings, so I will still hold my party there but I am hoping my dining experience will be better there.  The Family Style Menu is too hard to pass up if you are gonna host an event."}
{"text":"Had a small wedding reception in the Barolo room.  It was perfect.  The food was delightful and the service was wonderful.  I ate at the Maggiano's in Scottsdale AZ, and I was so unimpressed with that one, that I almost did not come here.  But since it was convenient for our wedding party, I stuck with it.  I am so happy that I kept our reservations here.

We had Calamari and the Spinach Dip for appetizer.  Next came the Ceasar and Chopped salad.   For the pasta course, we had Mom's Lasagna and Chicken Tortellini.  For main course; Chicken Parmesan and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.  And finally for dessert, Tiramisu and the Apple Crostada.

It was ALOT of food.  And it was all very very good.  There was not a single dish that I did not like.  I thought all the dishes were amazing. I guess I was a little surprised because I really thought it was just gonna be ok, decent food."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this establishment but it definitely won't be our last.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was impeccable and the portion sizes amazing.  The Mozzarella Marinara can't be beat.  Prices were in line with all other establishments of this calibre in the area.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! Our waiter was awesome but the hostesses working tonight are horrible. No energy, no smiles, and they were very rude. They made me feel uncomfortable and I'm sure anyone else would feel the same. Like I understand you may not be working but you're making money so slap on a smile and fake it! These two girls would never survive where I work."}
{"text":"We got to eat outside on the terrace overlooking the Strip in the Fashion Show Mall. Once again when you're in such surroundings with the view of the nice settings of the Wynn's, cascade, beautiful outside lamps, you expect to spend a nice time.

I had the Italian tossed salad to start with that consists of Iceberg, Arugula, Kalamata Olives, Red Onion, Pepperoncini, Garlic Croutons & Italian Vinaigrette and my friend had the Maggiano's salad made with Crispy Prosciutto, Red Onions, Blue Cheese & House Dressing.
With the blue cheese taste his salad was perfect, mine missed some savor. He had to ask for some fresh grated Parmiggiano cheese to make it more tasty.

Then my friend had the baked ziti that came with Italian Sausage, Pomodoro Sauce, Italian Cheese Blend and he really liked it. I had Four-Cheese Raviolis with Pesto Sauce that was good too but not out of this world because of the Pesto Sauce that was probably not home made or too creamy. Since Pesto is made with Olive Oil so I don't think they should add cream in it. That makes too rich. Especially with the cheese that is already in the ravioli definitely no need to add cream.

So if you want to eat an Italian (americanized) dinner with a nice surrounding book a table on the terrace at Maggiano's. Cheap place for the Strip location. Valet parking available with a lift that takes you directly to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. It's the Italian restaurant you could spend your whole life looking for. Recipes perfected, from scratch, family sized portions, great ambiance. Absolutely worth a trip."}
{"text":"This place is awesome 
The food is to die for and one of the fairest priced restaurants in Vegas located in the second floor of the fashion mall. Nice viewed the strip 

Cee Cee our waitress was an absolute Darlin 

Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"A-OK about sums it up for this gal.

I met my family here for lunch this week and wasn't super-impressed by anything in particular, but wasn't disappointed either. 

Let's start with what I did like: 

- They have a decent amount of lunch options. I would suggest taking a look at their half salad with soup or sandwich options. My sister and mother tried the ham and cheese panini with a chop salad. Both looked pretty tasty, but then again, when isn't melted cheese with ham good? My uncle tired the chicken parm sandwich and although he didn't say much, his plate was clean! 

- Chop Salad: pretty decent size and dressed salad for a \"half-size.\" We all swapped out the blue cheese crumbles, since for some reason no one in my family likes it--and it was still good. Nothing super special, but good. 

- Gnocchi with Italian sausage: Lately I've been letting myself indulge on whatever I want and this vodka sauce dish was pretty tasty. The gnocchi didn't taste homemade, but it was still good. The sauce was pretty tasty too. Overall it didn't knock my socks off, but it was a decent, chain restaurant dish. 

- Service: There was only maybe one hiccup, but otherwise, our server was really nice. She seemed a little frazzled, but was always smiling and very helpful.

I didn't like: 

- SUPER large lunch menu: Too many options for lunch, which makes me think not a lot of what they serve is all that fresh. They could cut that menu in half and still have too many options. This isn't dinner time. 

- HUGE, but shallow plates: Our table was hella-cramped with just three people and when my pasta dish came out, there was no room for this plate the size of my torso. Still, the guy helping our server made me feel like it was my job to figure out where we were going to put it. Nope. The portion was also a bit too large for lunch, and because the plate was so huge and shallow, my gnocchi got ice cold in mere minutes. Toss those plates, please. Figure out a better, more appealing way to serve your pasta.

- It's really dark, you guys! I'm only 29 and I felt like I needed reading glasses... at lunch time. 

- Chain-y... It just feels and tastes really chain restaurant... because, well.. it is! But I've also been to some chains that fooled me. I think Maggiano's could step their game up a lot. When we asked our server  about the tomato bisque, so told us the kitchen just put their alfredo sauce in tomato soup. Maybe I'm the only one, but that threw me off... big time. Not only does it sound like a short-cut a restaurant shouldn't be taking (considering how easy it is to make homemade tomato soup), but when they're cutting corners that I wouldn't even cut when I'm cooking at home, that's a big no-no for me. 

- No lunch-sized pasta portions, unless you want to do buy one, get one to take home thing... which, I didn't."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents and they have an amazing 2 salads, entrees, and a dessert to share for $40 dollars. Also, YOU GET A PASTA DISH TO TAKE HOME THE NEXT DAY! With any pasta entree you get to pick a pasta \"for tomorrow\". I don't know of anywhere else that does this but Maggiano's beats other chains out of the water because of this deal. I got the baked ziti and for my \"tomorrow pasta\" spaghetti and meatballs (which is in the freezer right now so I can enjoy later this week). As for the dessert we got the chocolate mousse cake- it was a huge chunk of amazing cake. I had two bites and about fell over. I was so stuffed. Anyways our server was outstanding and very attentive. I recommend this restaurant to any person that loves Italian food and could eat it all week! Delizioso!"}
{"text":"My brother and I went there when we were in Las Vegas and the food was very delicious. The belinis were out of this world.

The manager came to check up on us at the table to see if we were being taken care of. This was, of course, during a commercial. He was watching the game on the TV screens and couldn't be bothered during the game and kindly waited for a commercial.

After lunch, the manager and the waitstaff were congregated in the front of the reception area as we were about to leave and my brother and I both felt we were breaking up coffee talk.

Other than that, the experience was great as well as the food."}
{"text":"We went to Maggianos for our 1 year anniversary.at first they seated us in the middle of the restaurant at av wack table so we asked to b seated at a booth and they moved us with no problem....our Waiter Mark was on point and very cool..I highly recommend this place off you want a delicious Italian meal at a reasonable price...I highly recommend the calimari and salmon oscar BOMB... 5 Stars definitely"}
{"text":"Had a pretty nice meal here at Maggiano's a few weeks back. Came in on a Friday night so it was pretty busy but we were able to sit next to the bar so we just ate there. We did the special where you can split an appetizer get two entrees and split a dessert. My wife and I started with the mussels which were really flavorful with a bunch of lemony garlicky buttery sauce that you can dunk their bread in. Entrees were pretty okay. I was not a fan of mine I got the braised beef pappardelle pasta and was not impressed at all. I was just not diggin the flavor of the overall dish from the sauce to the meat. My wife got the Alfredo which was actually really good. For desert, we got the apple crostada which was phenomenal. Their coffee is really good as well. We were able to take home two pasta dishes as well because that was part of the special but the take home pastas were not as good as the ones in the restaurant. I would come back and maybe try some other things."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is excellent with tile work in the bar that reminds me of Albany NY which was settled by the Dutch. Service is well above average and there is a large selection on the menu. A favorite is selection of pasta dishes where you also get one to go all for less than $15. Can't beat that. The place does bother my stomach more than most places due to the richness of the sauces. Recommend for large or small groups."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great, pricing is reasonable as well. Been here multiple times now and they have never been on time with reservations. Service is hit or miss as well. The food and swirl bellini will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! The food, the service (We had Dina, she was fantastic!). They have a deal for $42.00. An appetizer or two salads, Two Pasta dinners, a dessert PLUS Two Pasta dishes to take home!! And it all tasted great! Love it..."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better.   I think it has really gone down hill.  Our food was just ok.   Server was just ok.  The portions are not on par and the whole experience was lacking.   Really expensive when there are better choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good place to eat while you shop. In the center of the mall that's an actual sit down restaurant that is way better then the fast food places. It can be busy around dinner time so just be prepared.

They have a great bar with lots of selection and a very big menu. One of my favorite dishes that actually isn't on the menu (but they will make it for you) is the spinach and artichoke dip. So yummy and so creamy! Their bread is freshly baked and comes nice and hot.

I always order the lemon salmon and it's normally served with spinach and I sub for asparagus and they don't seem to have a problem with changing anything on the menu! If you don't see a pasta that you want they can easily make one for you! (My sis does that)

The staff is pretty nice, I mean they are pretty busy so you might not feel that they are \"paying attention\" to you but overall pretty good food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with service and quality of food.  Just realized why I haven't been here in 6yrs.  It was crazy busy because of the prom guests. Maybe that's why but no excuses as far as I'm concerned.  The veal Marsala was awful.  Didn't even taste like Marsala. My friend had spaghetti with garlic and oil and looked like it was buried in oil or should I say olio.  Cappuccino was not good. Dessert was okay.  Next time I pick a chain I'll head to Macaroni Grill. Seriously!!!"}
{"text":"This is how Italian food is not supposed to taste. Chef have obviously never been in Italy and have no clue what is good Italian food. It would be bettwe to put a bit smaller portions and increase quality of food. Nothing taste like it should, and even mac and cheese is done on their own wrong way that doesnt even taste like any good one. Personel is ok and that is why i rate with 2 stars."}
{"text":"Drive A Little Further From The Las Vegas Strip This Location Is Newer And The Employees Are A Lot Friendlier Plus You Can Take Advantage Of The Summerlin Mall & Walk Your Food Off."}
{"text":"This Location Used To Be Good Some Of The Servers Are Rude , I Am A Local So I Think They Prey On The Tourists, I'm Going To Try The Summerlin Location. What I Don't Get Is Yes I Am A Local And As Soon As You Say You Want To Start Ordering Off The Happy Hour Menu The Service Sucks Its Still Revenue Right??? LAS VEGAS TOURIST'S BEWARE GO TO THE SUMMERLIN LOCATION"}
{"text":"We had lunch catered for a meeting. They were very generous with the portion sizes. Staff delivered and set up with all the equipment. Food, of course, was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good and so was the ambiance but service was lacking if anything.  Customer service could definitely use improvement. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brûlée and it was to runny. Overall, It was okay for the price point."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch yesterday because we had been given a gift card.  It is excellent.  I don't have one single complaint other than I wish we'd come here sooner.  When the server asked if we'd been there before we said no and a short time later the manager came to our table with a complimentary appetizer which was absolutely delicious - breaded zucchini.  I had the tomato soup and a half turkey sandwich - it is huge and really good.  My husband and I had chicken piccata which he said is the best he ever had.  To top it all off the service was super (Elisha).  The table next to us had two  young women who were also there for the first time and celebrating a birthday.  They wanted a wine but were unsure of which to order and Elisha brought them each a sample of both wines.  They also got the appetizer.  Next time I'll leave room for dessert - the carrot cake looked really good.  It is also extremely attractive.  This place is just one of the best ever and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Do not purchase e-cards from their website.  I purchased one as a gift for someone and it was relatively easy to do.   However, I found out the next day my friend had not received it.  After much haggling and shuffling me from corporate to local to the gift card company itself, I was told their system was down.  They offered me my money back or the gift card when up and running.  I did get the e-card finally that next day.  Bad business to take someone's money and not provide the commodity.   Believe me I wrote a letter to corporate and this is what I got: Your card has been viewed by Brad.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Family gathering, party of 6 earlier this week.  Calvin, our server, was attentive and ensured the evening was well paced.  Food & wine were very good and portions were more than ample (hey, its Italian isn't it?).  Will certainly return."}
{"text":"Overall:
Went out with a work group to Maggiano's last night.  I had a bourbon drink at the bar that was made well at a reasonable price, $8.  After the bar we were promptly seated and had good service for dinner.  We had a group of 6 and opted for the Family Style Classic dinner.  I thought this was a very good way to try different items at Maggiano's.  

Price/Selections:
We paid roughly $30 per person to split several appetizers, entrees and dessets.  There was more than enough food for everyone and any dish that you wanted more of the staff would bring more out at no additional charge.  This meant we  received several rounds of steak and chicken parm.  The staff was even okay with bringing out an additional main course at no charge for you to split and take home.  I feel for a chain type Italian restauant this was a good experience.  It is a little on the expensive side but since it was located in Southpark and it was for a work group this did not have a big impact on me.

Favorites:  
I thought the chicken parm and moms lasagna were the best main dishes.  I thought the best appetizer we had was the calamari.  For desert we had regular cheesecake and creme brulee.  The regular cheesecake with fresh strawberries was better to me."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a year and love the place. It's above average Italian for a fair price. I generally avoid carbs like the plague, but this place had bomb-diggity salads and wonderful protein options.

I usually order the salmon, either grilled or on a Caesar salad and it's never bad. No, it isn't the best fish you'll ever have but for the price you shouldn't be expecting such things.

I am all about reasonable expectations with food. I'd give the food a 3.5 and the service a 4 in the out-of-five-stars department."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on Saturday at 11:30 when they open. The server was prompt in greeting us but it was 1/2 hour before the bread came to the table because it wasn't ready! Seriously, when you know customers will arrive at the opening. The food was only fair and sparse. The best item was the green beans! I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Horrible service , food was OK . Train your staff please. Server had no idea about the menu and what they offer . I guess being a server now takes no knowledge or passion . Very sad"}
{"text":"Amazing food but most important though was the staff.   Nicole was taking care of us and she was AMAZING she should get a raise for sure.   Great experience and fully was fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm grateful we were given a $50 gift card for Maggiano's.  Because I'm still kind of  ticked off that even with that, we ended up paying an additional $80+ for a meal that was lacking by most standards in quality and service.

First, when walking from the parking lot to the front door, we were assailed by a horrendous sewage smell.  Lovely on a hot Phoenix night.  I assume not the restaurant's fault, but it set the tone.  It went from s**t to s**ttier.

Entered the restaurant and were dead-eyed by two hostesses.  Or Zombies.  I'm not sure.  After a few moments of staring each other down, one asked us if she could help us.  (No, we just dropped in to say hi.)  So we ask for a table and she says it will be about 10 minutes.  Really?  With the dining room half empty?  Should have turned and left then, but that gift card was burning a hole in DH's pocket.  So in less than 10 minutes (about seven), her partner-in-rigor leads us to a table, pushes some menus at us, and vanishes.  Thank goodness.  (Zombies are carnivores, right?)

Our server appeared pretty quickly.  We'd already looked at the menu and wine list and we ordered a plate of Bruschetta  to share and a couple of glasses of wine.   He returns in a decent amount of time with the wine, but manages to slop about a third of  DH's glass on the table.  He apologized mightily and swabbed the tabletop with DH's napkin, which he snatched up.  Still, at $11 a glass, it would have been nice if he'd offered to top off the glass.  It seemed like a long time, but about ten minutes later, the Bruschetta arrived.  What can I say---it was okay.  It was boring.  Nothing memorable about it, except it was pretty juicy. The toast got soggy fast.  I make this point because about mid-way, DH said plaintively, \"I wish I had a napkin.\"  Our waiter had never replaced the one used to mop up the wine.  However, I am a good wife and I let him use a corner of mine to tidy up with.

At the time of the appy delivery, we had ordered our meals.  DH and I each ordered a chopped salad and DS and DSGF ordered a caesar's salad.  Then DH ordered as his entree the Rigatoni \"D\" and I ordered the Lobster Carbonera and the kids each got a chicken Marsala.  

So we eat our salads, which were...mediocre.   The greens weren't particularly fresh, the olives, red onions and pepperoncini barely made a cameo, the dressing was thin and tasteless and was served on the salad when we had specified on the side.  

So our server came back and collected the plates---the kids had eaten up, DH did about 75% and I ate about half, because why waste room with a tired salad when I had Lobster Carbonera---oh what images that brought to mind!---coming for dinner!  Now each setting is set with two forks, and DH had used one for the bruschetta and one for his salad, so our server carried both away (but still no napkin, although he was like, \"oh, yeah!\" when we reminded him.)  Then we sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and FINALLY our entrees came out.  (Yay!)  But no additonal fork or a napkin for DH.  We didn't think to tell the food runner so we were sitting there while the food cooled waiting for our server to check back in.  Which he did...eventually.  And was very apologetic.  And whisked off.  And finally...FINALLY...my husband has all the necessary dining equipment again.

My Lobster Carbonera was a huge let-down.  What kind of images pop into your mind at this description:  spaghetti, lobster, smoked bacon, snap peas and garlic cream sauce?  How could you screw that up?  And yet...  Don't get me wrong, the amount of lobster was generous, the color of the snap peas was bright---so how did they manage to wring every bit of flavor out of it so it was one forkful after another of...nothing?  DH said said his Rigatoni was \"okay\", then wouldn't say much more.  I think because he was disappointed.  He had been so looking forward to a good Italian meal.  The kids gobbled up their chicken Marsala, but they are 18 and college students and would  eat shoe leather if it were free.  

I felt like this was basically a one star meal when our server drifted back to say howdy, collect plates, and suggested dessert.  And I was hungry and annoyed and I looked at the dessert menu and thought what the heck. So I ordered the poundcake with the vanilla ice cream and puddle of hot fudge sauce and caramelized bananas.  And that's why this review is two stars instead of one.  Because that was delicious.  I mean, I'll never set foot in Maggiano's again, but I will always remember that dessert fondly and when I get the time, I am going to make it myself, and then I can have all the caramelized bananas I want to slosh around in decadent hot fudge sauce.

So, just to finish the night off, DH stood up and there, on the back of his light khaki shorts, was a huge tomato stain.  Evidently there had been something on the seat.  So I've washed the shorts twice and it's fading---I am staying optimistic....  Something to remember Maggiano's by..."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a solid italian restaurant, but it is a little pricy.  It is located in the Fashion Mall, which probably warrants the higher prices, but I just did not think the quality was worth the extra $3-$5 the menu should have stated.  They have a private elevator to get up to the restaurant, which is nice.  And don't lose your hostess when they lead you to your table; this place is huge and a maze.

I came here for lunch and we began with complimentary bread.  Given it was lunch, there was a lunch special for half a sandwich, soup, or salad (pick two).  Some people tried this at my table, but it did not look the most appetizing.   I tried the gnocchi with sausage.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the sausage was not the greatest as far as flavor.  The sauce was quite good though.  

Overall if you are craving Italian while at the Fashion Mall, then Maggiano's will do, but it is pricey and probably won't bring you back to Little Italy in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant! ??????????C'est un bon restaurant!
Although my reservation information has been wrongly recorded in the system, I still think it's a good restaurant. The server Ramil offers excellent service to us (quality service) by greeting warmly, introducing specialty, recommending good meals. Something that should be improved is the waiter who takes meals from back kitchen to front guests should cooperate with server, like introducing the meal and expecting guests to enjoy their time.
The food quality is nevertheless good (stuffed mushroom recommended). If I have chance, I will visit Maggiano again! I will rate 9 out of 10 (one missing point for improvements!)"}
{"text":"Perfect place with a great city view from the patio. Enjoyed a great meal and received excellent customer service. Would definitely recommend!  Good food, good service and good atmosphere! Dinner with a view!"}
{"text":"I hate to have to give a below 4-star review when the service is extraordinary.
Our waiter, Kevin I believe (Im sorry if I get the name wrong but he's tall and talks quite fast), was super attentive and helpful.
However, the food wasn't very impressive. The lobster carbonara was quite bland and very liquid-y. My friend said her gnocchi was quite flour-y. 
Considering the great ambiance, the great service, and the great reviews this place's got, I expected more from the food."}
{"text":"I've always had great experiences here. Food is always great and very reasonably priced. The two of us had dinner with a glass of wine each,  and the tab came out to about $80. Not bad! 

I had the chicken marsala and absolutely loved it. The mushrooms were amazing. Paired it with a Zinfandel from Cline winery, and it supplemented extremely well. She had the lasagna and seemed to enjoy it as well, and the bread is amazing! I look forward to many more dinners here!"}
{"text":"AWSOME, AWSOME, AWSOME. Everything we had was wonderful. One of my favorite dishes is cannelloni, and they have now set the bar. Please do yourself a favor and try this place out. Don't forget the tiramasu to finish it all up. We will return the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  For the GF'ers out there, they many options--the food-servers can request most items to be gluten free.  Not much variety for strict vegetarians, though.  Atmosphere is classy and friendly, but noisy.  The  pork dish my wife had was very good, the lobster that I had was a bit overcooked and the risotto was a bit crunchy.  Would definitely go back--the salad was incredible,"}
{"text":"In Vegas for 1/2 marathon and looking for the required pre-race pasta dinner. Didn't think to check for reservations earlier and most places are booked. Went back to an old favorite and they had reservations available. I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. Huge portions. Nothing spectacular, but very tasty and filling. Husband had seafood pasta (can't recall name), which he really liked. We closed with the cheesecake. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Good food, great company, service was slow yet she was very busy. The beef tenderloins were great and the Maggiano's salad, you can't go wrong. Oh and the mushroom ravioli outstanding."}
{"text":"I've only had one thing here, and I even get it take out - it's so addicting and delicious. 

Rigatoni D - it'll make you smile inside!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant multiple times. Made a 6pm reservation and was seated promptly when arrived. My friend and I had the calamari app, rustic chicken pasta and veal parm. Everything delcious. Even saved room fro teh tiremisu desert which is probabaly one of the best tiremisu's I ever eat. Assad our waited was on top of things the whole time. made sure we always had everything we wanted and very friendly. I will ask for him next time I go. Only reason didn;t give it 5 star is because the items are just a tad bit pricey i think. I have noticed the prices inch up little by little every tiem I visit. But since this is a Vegas strip location, they can do this I guess, since more tourists than locals go here."}
{"text":"We went here to eat for a late Mother's Day dinner and it was amazing! The food here is sooo good and the bread is my absolute favorite! Their cheese ravioli is a must and I love their fried zucchini is the best I've ever had. Our server also made our experience extra special because of how informative, friendly, and professional he was. Very consistent service and overall amazing experience! If you want the best of the best ask for Brent! He will make your dinner experience at Maggiano's worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I have to say that I love the atmosphere. It is very open yet intimate. Our server was awesome and the food is Amazing! The only complaint I have is the tiramisu was well below average."}
{"text":"A couple of colleagues and I organized a community event in Maggiano's. Everything was excellent. They room had everything we needed. Projector and connections worked flawlessly and as is always the case when I have gone to Maggiano's the food and waiting staff were exceptional!

Thanks to all involved in making our night a success!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Italian place, all of the food is amazing.  They do a family style meal too that is all you can eat if you are with people who like the same foods.  They are copying Olive garden and doing the \"buy one, take one\" with their pastas when you dine in so you get two for the price of one!   Seems to always be busy so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, Josh the bartender was super nice, however the hostess at the sign in desk was not at all friendly and bordered on rude/arrogant. Servers are terrific however. Good Marco's meal however the 'take home' dish was EXTREMELY oily and tasted awful. I'm not sure that happened to this food when it was heated at home a day later but I won't order a Marco's meal again. It looks like I'll be back to my Chicken Francees off their standard menu. In terms of dessert..don't miss the Tirimisu..it's to die for. Overall a good restaurant, just skip the leftovers/Marco's spare meal."}
{"text":"As I was shopping at Fashion Show Mall I noticed this Italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on Yelp later for a possible dinner option.

According to Yelp this place was worth trying. I used the open table feature to make a reservation (not knowing if it was really needed or not, but I figured why not). I'm glad I did. When we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait. We were seated immediately. 

We were seated in a comfortable booth seat, and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu. This place had a good variety of Italian food from pastas, to chicken, beef and seafood selections. I liked that they had a family style option as well. At first glance I would say this place looks pricey specially since your entrée comes with just your entrée no salad or soup like Olive Garden. 

We ordered a side salad to share that was $4.95 but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy French bread served with olive oil and vinegar (oh so yummy, and dangerous!). 

Our plates took over 30 minutes to arrive, if it was not for the bread and salad I would have been more upset. 

I ordered Mom's Lasagna made with meatballs and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce. I choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already. My plate arrived and what do you know, it probably could have served four people, fairly large portions. I ate all of it, in phases but I ate it all. It was exquisite. Perfect layering, the lasagna stayed together (I hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart). 

My favorite part was being serenaded by a duo (violin and guitar) to one of my wedding songs (It's Impossible). If it weren't for the Wynn in the background I could almost say I was in Italy.

I don't have any complaints about this place. Our total bill came to $37.50: two entrees, one side salad and one beverage. We came on a Monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"Chicken red pepper flatbread, the famous rigatoni D, and chicken marsala. Not to mention the best corn side dish I've ever had. Maggianos  never fails to impress us. Plus, our waiter, Gabriel, was wonderful and very attentive. I only wish there was one closer to our home so we could go more often"}
{"text":"Our server did a fairly good job and was pleasant. The Caesar Salad was crisp, cold yet unexceptional. The Tomato Bisque soup came to the table at barely above room temperature. We informed our server who politely replaced it with another bowl which was slightly warmer then the first. Although it tasted just fine. The Chicken Marsala chicken was decent yet once again not too much above room temperature. The sauce was MEEH and the mushrooms chunky instead of sliced. Don't know, maybe they are going for a rustic presentation. The Mushroom Ravioli appeared as if it had been held on the plate for quite awhile then coated with a tasteless very white sauce which resembled whipping creme far more then an Alfredo Sauce. There was no flavor to the sauce. The ravioli had a chance had then been at least reheated in some hot water first then mixed with a nicely prepared sauce in the same pan. As opposed to just ladling a tasteless very white sauce over them and then trying to reheat in a salamander therefore drying out the exposed parts of the Raviolis and burning the horrible sauce. As I attempted to move them around on my plate they were stuck. That's how I know how they were prepared. Another franchise restaurant with poorly trained or inadequate kitchen staff putting out mediocre food to the masses. Never going back, never recommending."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It is really worth the price, which really isn't bad for the quality or quantity. 

I have been here twice and the only down side was the service. Our first server was decent, yet our second server was unobservant, and somewhat rude."}
{"text":"Oh no, Maggiano's, what is happening to you?  This used to be a GREAT place to eat, with delicious food, wine, good atmosphere and service.  Sadly, about a year ago when I was in LV and I ate there with my partner the food was just OK and we felt it was overpriced for the quality. I felt the same when I was there again last October.  Still, I have eaten there almost every trip I take to LV so I went again a few days ago. This time, YIKES!  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and I could barely eat it.  I wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what, because I could only eat a few bites.  It was sitting on top of spaghetti which was (weird and tasted) just OK.  Before my main meal I had tomato bisque soup which was very salty.  I was so disappointed in the meal.  My waiter was rather scattered.  I had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread. I will say he was friendly and did his best.  I think he could tell I did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when I asked for my check.  I will say those were delicious, but I wasn't there for cookies.  I don't think I will come back to eat at Maggiano's unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track. I'm sad to give this review as I really used to love Maggiano's, and that is why it gets two stars instead of one.   :-("}
{"text":"Ordered the sirloin steak and it was over cooked big time.  The server was awesome and had the kitchen try again.  On the second attempt it was a little less done but still over medium when ordered medium rare.  I don't suggest ordering any steaks when this place is very busy.  Stick with pasta and seafood.  The service really saved the experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were having a girls day and she really wanted lobster or crab Alfredo or something with seafood and pasta.  And we were. both crazy hungry bordering on \"hangry\"!  Since we were nearby, at Canyon Ranch SpaClub in the Venetian hotel I thought we'd stop in and try Maggiano's.  Our server wasJoey, he was thoughtful, down to earth and helpful with our decision and accommodating our tastes.  We started with the calamari which was golden, lightly salted and the perfect crispness that we like in a calamari. Next, we had the Linguine de mare, loaded with clams, mussels, meaty shrimp and bits of lobster, this portion was very generous and I'm glad we shared because we took the rest home which would feed one more!  We also had the side of chopped salad with the bleu cheese, bacon, tomatoes, avocado and dressing, we only had a few bites and took the rest home. My daughter REALLY wanted dessert so she ordered their special, Joey described it as a s'mores pie, she was sold.  There was a Graham cracker crust which was delicious but hard to cut through, the next layer was this amazing,silky, melt in your mouth chocolate ganache and the top layer was marshmallow which was caramelised by a torch, it tasted more like meringue than marshmallows so maybe I didn't hear the description correctly. The ambiance is very nice inside and I loved the outdoor seating. It was fun watching all the tourists having a good time on Cinco de Mayo!  
P.S. We left Maggiano's so full that we had to walk around, Fashion Show is a great mall to enjoy. Also, you'll save money because you're too full to try anything on!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great as always . Went in for Father's Day and service was good food was good . No complaints."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat Italian food our last night here.  We were shopping at Fashion Show Mall and looked up our options. With such great reviews we decided to come here. When we walked in without reservations, the girls at the front were not the most friendly. (Unusual we thought since we called ahead and they said not necessary since it was only us 2.) We finally were seated in a great booth. Renan was our server. Because of my allergies he had the chef come out and talk to us just to make sure. After some good suggestion, we decided on calamari to start, Frutti d'mar and Salmon Oscar. Wow it was so amazing. The portion were so huge we couldn't finish it. 
But even though the food was amazing, Renan made our first visit here incredible. His friendly and excellent service pushed our visit to the best Italian food we have ever eaten. (That despite traveling to Italy and having great food there too.) So if you are having a craving for amazing Italian food, hurry here.  You will love it like we did."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the best sausage and peppers dish on any menu. Yet it was at its best before they began cutting up the peppers into very small hard to taste bites. Fortunate for me, they take requests.

I don't recall the names all of the various meals I've had but THAT BREAD served is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Go hungry because you get what you pay for!! The sauce was fresh and the tiramisu was by far the best I have ever had. Stuffed mushrooms are my favorite. Only negative is that the tables are really close together."}
{"text":"This was a family favorite for a while then we had a couple of negative experiences.  We are due back for a visit and will raise it to a four star if the experience is good:). The food is typically good and it's a good family style restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and will not return. With so many options in Vegas for food, the details count. I asked for Maggianos Salad and I received it although it tasted like it was premade 5 hours prior with soggy lettuce.  The flatbread was good and the service was bad hence the 3 stars. A restaurant such as this should not be sending out pre-made salads with soggy lettuce."}
{"text":"Idiots at the hostess stand. I have reservations for 6:30 today. My daughters and I arrive 15 minutes. I ask if we can sit so we start apps and wine for me. Nope... I have to wait for my husband and young son to get here. Seriously!!! What a bunch of idiots."}
{"text":"I'm full blooded Southern Italian and this was good food. The wait was nearly 45 minutes but I was with a group of 5, and we walked in off the street with no reservation. The staff was friendly, service was great, prices were reasonable. Been here twice now and everything was spectacular. This is a must try when in town. There is a good relaxed atmosphere when inside and a nice escape from the business of the strip...even though it is on the strip. Very nice place to visit if you want to have a good, Vegas restaurant  experience. The Vegas thing is true, I tipped my waiter $20 bucks at the beginning of the meal and he came very frequently to the table. Drinks, bread, anything we asked for came very quickly. I gave him a good tip at the end of the meal cause he ran his tail off to make our meal the best we have experienced there yet. Cheers!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 - 4 ****
Located in the Fashion Show Mall, tons of parking and glass windows to enjoy the scenery.  
Reservations highly recommended as it can get very busy. 

I've eaten here several times and for some reason I keep coming back.  It must be the large portions and great service. 

Food: 
Spinach Salad- Tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers, roasted red onions and Gorgonzola cheese, yummy applewood smoked bacon, toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette. 
Tomato Caprese-Sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and Crispy Calamari. 

Dinner: 
Lobster Carbonara- It  was dry so I would never order it again. 
Mom's Lasagna with Meat Sauce
Beef Tenderloin Medallions

It' really not a bad place despite of what others has said.   To me it's reasonably priced, service was great and I love the complimentary bread."}
{"text":"Me and my family absolutely love this Italian gem the food is so flavorful and delicious. Everything we have picked off the menu you can't go wrong with. The food has so much depth and sauce of course that makes the meal incredible. And the staff is very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Very very good food, only tried a couple dishes butt they were outstanding and very fresh. The pasta seems to be made from scratch which is always a plus and the sauces are not overwhelming. Very good"}
{"text":"The restaurant wasnt worth spending my money at. Food was salty  , eggplant parmesan  was off in taste,  very disappointed. Spent Fathers Day and a Birthday there.  Not in my near future again."}
{"text":"Service and food were fantastic. The prices were great, too. I ordered pesto chicken, really tasty"}
{"text":"First, our waiter, Michael, was excellent. He did everything right...all the little things like greeting us as soon as we sat, making lots of suggestions for wine and food, being punctual, and taking care of the kids. Having a positive upbeat and solid waiter contributes tremendously to the experience.  And then you bring me great food?!  We loved everything. My chicken parmigiana with alfredo rather than spaghetti was spot on. And my wife's lobster dish was delicious. It's been a long time since I've had this good of an experience eating out!"}
{"text":"I've never been one to run to my computer to post a review after dining at a restaurant, but with Maggiano's, I felt that I needed to give credit where credit was due.  

The first thing I have to mention is the service.  I've only been to Maggiano's twice but both times our server was helpful, friendly and attentive.  When I asked about Gluten Free options, the chef came out to our table and discussed the possibility of substituting the gluten free pasta and even went in to detail about the sauces (most are gluten free) and the meatball (not gluten free).  While slightly embarassed by the scene of having a chef at my table, I felt much safer eating there and knowing the chef was aware that I had to avoid gluten.

The second thing that blew me away was the Classic Pasta Deal.  Basically, you order your classic pasta dish, which is about 4 portions worth of food and then FOR FREE you can order a second classic pasta dish to go!  I had to ask the waiter about 4 times if this was legit before I believed him.

The prices weren't outrageous, and I didn't have to pay extra for the gluten free pasta which was nice.  I would definitely recommend Maggiano's whether you're going out for a big family dinner, on a date or just with some friends"}
{"text":"Great experience. We went here for my mom's birthday dinner. Appetizers included bruchetta and mozzarella/tomatoes/balsamic (very good), as well as the bread every table comes with. The bread paired with olive oil was really, really good. I ordered the beef medallions, and they were delicious. Cooked how I wanted them, soft, and the sauce was pretty good, too. It came with very good mashed potatoes and onion rings (very thin) and portobello mushrooms, which were all right. I tried some of the shrimp scampi, and that was exceptional as well. They even came by to drop of lemon cookies with candles in them for my mom--nice touch.
Service was very good, really nothing to complain about here. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was craving lasagna and Maggiano's has a deal where you purchase one select entrée and you get to take another entrée home for free :) So we chose the fettucine dish as our free one. Good service and location right between CPK and H&M."}
{"text":"My mother, sister and I are annoying. I recognize this and embrace it. We involve shopkeepers, cashiers, janitors, sales associates, servers and anyone else in the near vicinity  in our squabbles and lighthearted  disagreements. 

Last night's dinner was no different. Our server Tony was great. He played along and totally made fun of us. We loved it. 

Highly recommend making a reservation on the weekend as they get very full. I overheard a couple leaving saying there was a 50 minute wait without one. 

The drink menu is full of fruity froo-froo drinks but they have plenty of wine choices and full bar for any other drinks. My sister loved her Lemon Drop Martini (ugh) and my Hendricks and tonic was damn strong.

We had the Stuffed Mushrooms to start and they were delicious. Loaded with garlic and butter and there were probably 15 of them!

The entrees are good, not amazing. I had the Lobster Carbonara, which isn't really a true carbonara but it was pretty good otherwise. They put snow peas in it which I find weird, but the lobster pieces were massive. For $20 (the most expensive pasta dish), they had better be!

If you order a 'classic pasta',  you get to choose another order to take home for free! What! That's the weirdest, coolest concept I've seen in a chain restaurant. Be prepared to walk out with tons of food.

Overall, pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We were in the mall and wanted to eat a leisurely lunch. This was a great choice. Our table had a fantastic view of the strip. Even if you don't want pasta, this place still works. The bruschetta appetizer had grilled shrimp on top. Never had seen that, but it worked. The chopped salad was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"I've been going to Maggiano's since it opened and have always found the food authentic and tasty. When i find a dish I like I stick to it and here I found the Rigatoni D a true favorite.  I'm a difficult eater and usually have to create my own dish. (I should open a restaurant) so of course, I had to change the make up of the dish. They have an AMAZING tomato vodka cream sauce, one of the best i've had in Phoenix that is a must try. I order the Rigatoni D with the vodka sauce, no onions. (they are caramelized and don't pair well the the vodka sauce) The mushrooms (full caps), chicken and vodka sauce is truly amazing with the over sized rigatoni noodles. It's a dish a crave once a week. Also try their dinner salad with their italian dressing. Big shavings of fresh parmagian cheese and one of the best italian dressings i've had.

The only reason I wont give Maggiano's 5 stars is because they did something to their eggplant parmagian. It used to be the only other dish i would order because it was so amazing. layers of cheese and breaded eggplant that's served in a big hearty casserole style chunk. The past few times i've ordered it, the whole thing was burned. I even sent it back one time to get a new piece and had the same problem. I miss this dish a lot. Not sure why they can't cook it right. Burned eggplant? I don't think so Maggiano's. Yummy tomato cream vodka sauce? Yes please."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a dozen times, so I thought it is about time I write review.

Food: once in a while, I do get food that overly spiced (salty) like today's butternut squash ravioli.  But most of the time, all the food I ordered so far has been meeting my expectation.

What I like this the best about this place is bite size desert. It is just a right portion size of desert after the big meal. I normally order a cup of coffee. They serve lavazza coffee.  Gotta have Italian coffee at Italian restaurant!

I like the decor of inside and outside of this restaurant. Also they set up tables and chairs spread enough that you don't feel tight being there.

Service is good, not excellent but never really had any issues here."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in the seating availability although I had reservations but, the food was amazing. We had a party of 6. I wanted a window seat but, none were available. The first option was too close to the busboy station so, very noisy you can imagine so, we decline that and accepted another table. Which was extremely wobbly and uneven. Someone even spilled a glass of water as soon as we sat down. So, probably not an ideal spot if you have a huge party. We had 6. 

Now,

I don't normally do Italian food because, it's just too heavy and the portions are huge! I've heard so many good things about this place and I had to try it. We don't have a location in KC. It's probably a good thing for my waist line lol. 

I tried one of the classic dishes. Baked ziti! Yummy! Presentation could have been better but, it was very flavorful, meat sauce was on point, the right amount of cheese and the pasta was cooked perfectly :)"}
{"text":"Food was great!  I got the Sausage Ziti and my wife selected the Salmon. It has been a long time since I ate at this restaurant and I'll have to come back soon."}
{"text":"This time we got a professional server, Calvin.   We decided to sit on the patio since the weather is now picture perfect.  My companion ordered the happy hour chardonnay.   I ordered a manhattan.   I tasted his chardonnay.   Mehhh.   No, thank you.   My manhattan was perfect!  We ordered the margarita flatbread from the appetizer menu, and the artichoke dip appetizer.   A lot of starch for sure.   In fact, too much starch, but, oh, well. ...   The flatbread was tasty and presented very well.   The artichoke dip was accompanied by small pieces of baguette.   I opted to put the dip on the bread that had been served with our drinks.   The baguettes were too dry and hard to really enjoy.   I mean, it wasn't any drier than normal.   Just that the french bread was fluffier and better suited.   Yes, I'm ready to return for dinner.   Ask to sit in Calvin's station as your server if he's working."}
{"text":"We were here for a wedding reception so not sure if food would be better off the menu.  Nothing was bad just nothing great.  I'm not a big family style eating guy.  Service was efficient but not outstanding.  We will be back to dine from the menu.  Bar area was great!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to go with the parents for Thanksgiving.  Dinner was served family style and it was a ton of food!  Started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent.  Then had a choice of 2 salads, 2 meats - we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach I ever had - then 2 side dishes in addition - mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay - 2 pasta dishes - we had the signature Rigatoni D and the angel hair with pomodoro sauce/sausage - and 2 desserts!

It is a little pricey, but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers, I think it's worth it.  The best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu.

I've been to other Maggiano's in Chicago and to me, they're all pretty much the same - good and plentiful food and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"This was a first time visit!  We've always wanted to try a Maggiano's but unfortunately there isn't one near where we live.  We hopped online and made a reservation for a Friday night.  We arrived just a little late due to traffic, but the hostess was accommodating and nice about it.  We waited just a short while for a table of 5.

Our waitress greeted us quickly and we ordered drinks.  Our service throughout our whole dinner was exceptional and prompt.  She was very hospitable and we never had empty glasses.  A huge win for me!

I ordered the gnocchi and sausage dish, two of my favorite foods.  I also order a side Caesar salad.  My salad was delicious, dressed well and tasty.  Other people in our group ordered various soups and salads.  Everyone was very happy with their food.

Once our entrees came, everyone enjoyed their food.  My husband ordered lasagna which was part of their special.  We took home another entree of lasagna as part of that deal.  Well worth it!

I would definitely visit again if in the area.  Everything was spot on even for a very busy Friday evening."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and I love it. It is my boyfriend and my 4 year anniversary. Our server was training a young lady but even with that added stress to him, the service was still awesome. We sat outside to enjoy the night and watch the sun go down. 
We had another server assisting us throughout the night and she was amazing! Wish I would have gotten her name. I even asked her for an amazing dessert choice and without me asking, she sent out a sampler free of charge. Will be back again. 

PS: the bread and oil is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Food was amazing as always. Great prices for huge portions. Restaurant was very clean. And the service.... Amazing!!! Megan was so on point. Didn't miss anything and extremely professional. Manager even stopped by my table to check on everything. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maggiano's before and didn't think that much of it.  However, Vegas Maggiano's may be your \"What should we eat\" dinner place.  I thought it was so worth it paying like $15 for pasta rather than paying the same amount for pho.  Plus, it feels like you can just sit down and chill.  The food is typical Italian chain so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The wait staff was impeccable.  My favorite part of the meal is the hunk of Parmesan cheese they give you.  yummy!  I also enjoyed the grappa they hand you at the end of the evening."}
{"text":"Come here for a ton of family style Italian food.  You definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack/meal at 9:30 in the evening. Just soup and salad. Everything was good, service was good, seating and for a chain restaurant I'm always impressed how un-chain this restaurant tastes. Just good food! Portions seem huge to me too. Everything was clean, even under my table and the window sill.

We ate inside, but the outside seating was heated seeing the evening air was chilly. Looked nice too."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as all the other maggianos but ok for the area."}
{"text":"We love Maggianos at FS so when they opened one at DTS we were super excited. 
The staff was super friendly (almost overwhelming) at the host station. I get that. They are brand new and want to make an great first impression. Our server was Jenna. So nice!! She was sweet and engaging with my 2 peanuts. She gets 5 stars. I don't think my two \"suggestions\" are worth anymore then 1 star loss...
I wish they had a light sauce for the non meat eaters in the crew.  (Also wish they had almond/soy for coffee too but...)
I wish their kids ice cream was more than 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'm sure the food cost for some chocolate syrup and sprinkles is next to nothing and it would make it 100% more appetizing to a 3yr old. We would have gone for gelato if we knew that was the case. But, they have this \"gift\" part of the menu. If you order from one section of the menu you get a gift. When she said it I thought maybe a coupon for future visit or complimentary dessert. Nope, a free entree. Winning. I was able to grab dinner for my husband who was not feeling well and was home sleeping. I will be back again and again. Food was delicious, service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really great Italian Resturant at a more than reasonable price.  Excellent service and a pleasant place to people watch."}
{"text":"Went on dinner date on 4/14, made reservations greeter didnt even acknowledge that we arrived. Hostess saw that we were uncomfortable as she sat the table. Too many tables and one restaurant.I thought to myself if were with our other table next to us.anyways. .. Our server Stephanie was great very knowledgeable on the menu offered appetizers(Bruschetta)appetizer was out b4 bar drinks! asked for chilled martini's .actually came out chilled! Food  was delicious!!! (chicken piccata and chicken parmesan).stefanie offered us tiramisu as dessert was delightful! Thank u Stefanie for great service!"}
{"text":"Good and pretty reasonably priced, but I probably wouldn't drive across town to eat here. Probably the best thing we tasted all night was the zucchini appetizer with lemon aioli dipping sauce. The waitress said it was a house specialty and I could see why. I don't really like zucchini and I happily ate my share of crispy panko-breaded zucchini and aioli. The bruschetta was good but a bit on the sweet side. Lots of garlic though. 

Hubby ordered the fruitti de mar (it had a different name on the menu). It was huge, delicious and full of seafood, but many of the shells from the seafood were cracked and he was picking shell fragments out of his meal all night. When we mentioned this to the server she apologized but that was it. Overall, that was our only major issue. My chicken saltimboca was good, and our friends enjoyed the homestyle pastas. They each got one to eat and a complimentary one to bring home, which I thought was a cool idea on the restaurant's part.

Service was friendly and efficient even with several large groups. Apparently if you have a group larger than 10 you can pay a flat price per person and they will serve everything family-style. Reservations are definitely a good idea here. The place was pretty empty at 4:45 on Saturday but by the time we left at 6:30 it was packed with an hour wait."}
{"text":"I will give the Maggiano five stars! I loved the location so if you get hungry while you shop, this is a perfect place. Also, the food was great! It's all made to order so there is a little wait but its worth it because its fresh! I don't remember my servers name but he was very knowledgeable, friendly, and funny. It was my aunts birthday and they brought her a surprise cake but no loud song and I was fine with that!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about Maggiano's?!? It's the perfect spot to enjoy a delicious meal served with    one's dining pleasure in mind. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by smiling faces at 
the Host Stand. At the bar, Ben served our Friday 
\"kick off the weekend right\" drinks and we knew it would be a great evening! When we got to our table it was Ken who took over and our meal was off to the races! Our friends ordered the tuna and ravioli... my hubby had the salmon... and I had my favorite, Denver steak \" with a twist.\" You see the beauty part about Maggiano's is you can have your meal your way. I love to substitute linguine instead of mashed potatoes and they always accommodate my requests with no hesitation! In fact, if Jena, the head chef in the kitchen, is unsure of your wishes, she will come out and make sure that your meal is prepared the way you want it! Whether it's Ken, Richard, Steven or Joanne, our dining experience is always filled with fun. Dan, the Ambassador of Hospitality is ever ready to say hello and manager, Stephanie makes sure we are well taken care of. All in all, Maggiano's is high on our list of favorite places to enjoy a great evening of dining pleasure!"}
{"text":"Came to vegas later in the evening   Went here for dinner was a nice atmosphere was served fast got much needed water vegas was 104 atnight she fulled up my water at least 8 times!!! 3 breads. Needless to say she got a 20 buk tip!!!!! Calamari and shrimp appetizer were to dye for main courses were fair lobster carbonara runny sause. And my daughters food had way to much spinach but dessert made up for it   Service was to noch"}
{"text":"Our server DINA was AMAZING! She paid attention to what my auntie and I like! She was so accommodating and very knowledgable of the menu. She was able to answer each of our questions! You can tell that she really enjoy her job and she gives excellent customer service!! She recommended everything that we ordered and my auntie and I enjoyed everything!!! Having her as our server was a great experience she was very friendly! My auntie and I will for sure come back and look for DINA again!!! Thank you very much Dina for being an amazing server!!!"}
{"text":"Had a gift card have been here before. The waiter was very pleasant and attentive. Table was okay my chair was up against a pillar but I could move. The entrees were excellent. However the first tray of bread was stale and chewy. We asked for more bread and it was hot and fresh. You had to ask for balsamic but there was evoo on the table. The pepper mill didn't work very well. The side salads, italian style had more wilted lettuce than fresh like it had been sitting in dressing for hours. I had the chopped salad for lunch about two weeks ago and it was also wilted and very flavorless and watery.  Given that I still would go back because I love the fried zucchini strips and the parmesan crusted tilapia was delicious. My husband loved his spaghetti and meatballs, pasta perfectly al dente.  Kind of a toss up between 3 and 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"All I can say is holy moly ravioli! Amazing Italian food, great vibes, great service, beautiful view, and did I say the food was on point? The Four Cheese Ravioli and the  Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo were the best I have ever had. As a local I know their are a lot of Italian restaurants in Las Vegas but nothing beats Maggiano's. Always on the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party for our holiday.. Our server Paul went way out of his way to make it perfect! He was soo nice and friendly with everyone and especially the kids! 

The food was good as well, to be honest it can be better but with such a large group (40 people) it was good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.

I've eaten at Maggiano's on The Strip a few time. Always great and a spectacular view of The Strip. A friend suggested travelling all the way across town to this location. You see we had a $100 gift card from my office Christmas party. Two years ago we used it at on The Strip and got one spectacular meal out of it. The friend said the Summerlin location has a Two for $44 special which is super deal.

You get two salads or one appetizer. We got the salads. My wife got the Chopped Salad, I got the Maggiano's Salad. It was the largest side salad I've even had. We both loved it along with the delicious sourdough bread. 

Next came our entrees. My wife did the $5 upgrade and got the Rigatoni \"D\" and I stuck to the standard options and had the Brasised Beef Pappardelle. My wife loved hers, using the bread to sop up every bit of the sauce, but I think I came out on top with my Pappardelle. Every bit was spectacular. I'm sure the pasta was fresh made. We almost ate everything, but we knew we had dessert coming. So they packaged up the extra for us and the best part of this deal is, you get to order a second entree which they put straight into your bag to take home. For the second entree we ordered Mushroom Ravioli and Lasagna. 

Now onto dessert. My friend recommended the Chocolate Zuccotto Cake. That was the best recommendation. When it arrived, the couples at the table next to us just stared at it and said shame on you. We didn't care and knew they were just jealous anyway. The mousse between the cake layers was the best.

We went away stuffed and really, really happy. We left carrying at least two more meals each and used just under half our gift card (we also had a coupon for joining their eclub). Because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary they also gave us a card for a free dessert on our next visit."}
{"text":"I normally would've given Maggiano's a 3 star rating, but they earned an extra star for dealing with our pain in the ass party! Long story short, 17 of my closest girlfriends and I visited Vegas. We made the reservation, then made our choices for appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert. We showed up 45 minutes late on a Saturday night. I was having panic attacks the entire way to the restaurant because I WORK in a busy restaurant, and I know the repercussions of being almost an hour late with a party of 18 on a Saturday night. They were very patient, and we had an amazing private room...it was in a wine closet. So fun! Our waiter was awesome. The food was okay...typical Italian (upscale) chain fare."}
{"text":"This chain does Italian right and it does feel as they try to keep it authentic. With a lovey atmosphere and great service this should be a very enjoyable dining experience. 

They have a decent sized menu which should be able to accommodate most everyone's tastes. As I mentioned above, the dishes here don't have any shortcuts take and have a good quality about them. The portion sizes are huge too. This is a safe choice to grab some delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"Amazing !!!!! I took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday and omg we were blown away ! The food was amazing ! We had the Bruschetta, Rigatoni D, and Chicken Parmesan ! After we ate a wonderful man came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend with his guitar. Then the restaurant manager came over and asked how our night was going then insisted that we have dessert in honor of his birthday . I didn't the name of the three desserts we were given complimentary btw but it was amazing !!!!! Will defiantly be returning !"}

Thank you, Maggianos, because my husband is a fan, we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Last year I went to this exact Maggiano's and was very disapointted in the service in the lounge, so I thought I would give the dining room a try this time around.

I walked in very hungry and the waiter came quickly and asked us what we wanted to drink. The waiter promised that our food would come fast and kept reassuring us that drinks, bread, food, etc was coming.  I felt like this was sorta a lie and it was a coverup for the reality which was slow service.

I ordered the raviloli and i was disapointted in the amount of food I got.  It was made up for by the fact that I got a free meal to take home, with the buy one take one. Everyone else with me however was very satisified with their emal.

Overall, there is a huge wait and I would highly recommend calling ahead.  The food was very enjoyable and once again the service was slow.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars beacuse I felt like the food was reasonsaby priced for the deal and tasted good, but the service was slow."}
{"text":"I'm not a big chain fan but I had a gift certificate that I needed to use up.  The food was fine.  Nothing exceptional for the price.  There was an unexpected pleasant surprise.  When I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce off the classic pasta menu I was told that I could choose another pasta menu item to take home.  My boys were very happy to have lunch....and dinner!!!  LOTS of pasta!  :)"}
{"text":"Erica and Dean were so awesome behind the bar!!! Nick was so helpful and made great recommendations!! This is by far the best service I've had in a LONG time!!!"}
{"text":"What you would expect. Massive portions, heavy food, lots of flavor and old school feel."}
{"text":"It's a national chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. But, the good thing about higher-end chain restaurants is that they're consistent. And, in the case of Maggiano's, they're consistently good, for the most part, and a good value.

My wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants, which included Chili's and Macaroni Grill. Naturally, we chose the best of the lot -- Maggiano's. Located in Fashion Show mall, it's a pain to find the entrance. Walking through the mall, you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the Strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance.

This was a family outing for us -- our three year old son in tow -- so we were happy to be seated at a booth. They've got a kid's menu with the usual stuff (pizza, chicken fingers, mac-n-cheese, etc). For $5.95 kids get an entree, beverage, and a dessert (lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream). My kid opted for the pizza. It's a long, rectangular, crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles. Tasty and large enough for two kids to share.

The lasagna was the best item of the night. A huge brick shape filled with crumbled meatballs and Italian sausage and covered in meat sauce. The gnocchi also came in a large portion, good enough for two people. While it was a little too dense, it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy Italian sausage and a creamy (oversauced) vodka sauce.

They have small dessert options for $2.95. The chocolate cake was decent. A little too cold and firm, but it hit the spot. We also opted for the lemoncello pie ($7) -- essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers.

While not the best Italian food in the city, Maggiano's does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price, considering its location.

{"text":"Don't let the white table linens, paneled walls and comfortable booths fool you.  Maggiano's is just another chain restaurant with completely disinterested staff.  Last weekend, in high spirits and in the midst of a shopping excursion, we stopped off here for a relaxed lunch.  The hostess met us with great energy, but unfortunately her charm did not pass on to the servers.  

Our waitress took an eternity to greet us and take our drink orders.  We ordered a cosmopolitan, a sidecar and a vodka gimlet, all served \"up.\"  Only the cosmo came in a martini glass - the others were served on the rocks.  We politely informed our waitress that we ordered our drinks \"up\" and she, being all of 18, tried to correct *us* that \"those are 'up.'\"  No, these are \"on the rocks.\"  We chalked this up to fighting a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent and moved on to food orders.  My good mood was now also on the rocks rather than up.

When ordering, we asked to start with a salad before our entrees.  Apparently that translated into \"bring us salads, then bring the entree out right after.\"  The food was mixed.  My butternut squash ravioli were so hot they burned my mouth, and didn't have any flavor when they were cool enough to eat.  The Rigatoni \"D\" and Chicken Francese that my companions ordered were better.  Our waitress, of course, disappeared after delivering the salad and didn't check back until bringing the bill.  For my money, I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"My family & I went to Maggiano's to celebrate my daughter's & nephew's 13th birthday. It was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was very prompt and informative. I ordered a bottle of Chianti and the price was very reasonable. I had the Shrimp and Crab Cannoli and it was soo delicious. Everything we ordered was great & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The banquet department rocks here  After not even getting a call back from Brio, called Maggiano's my goodness they were so helpful & nice. They emailed me right away with all the pertinent information. Had lots of choices to choose from, very easy. The banquet room was set up exactly as requested. Once we arrived the staff came out to greet us that was so exciting & professional. Once seated the appetizers started rolling and there were lots of them. The timing of the food was on point & delicious. If you ever need a hassle free environment to have a party this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. This was our first visit. After we were seated, we waited 15 min. to have drink orders taken and about 10 more minutes to get them, which is when we ordered our dinner because we didn't want to have to wait again. It took about an hour or more to get our food. On top of that, it was lukewarm. We were so hungry, we ate it instead of complaining or calling for a manager because waiting seemed to be the specialty of the night here, at least for us. The service was terrible and the food was disappointing. The place was packed, I guess we were the only ones that didn't have the same experience everyone else had."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Maggie's is great place to have a great Italian meal with a friend or 50 of your friends and family.  The meatballs are yummy and the chicken and shrimp penne pasta are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  If you are in for a quick meal go to the bar area for a first come first serve table.  Love being able to walk-in and find a table to have a great meal and be in and out. Oh and I know this is simple but the bread is always super good with oil and vinegar but if you ask for butter it's even better.  They have awesome butter. Yes, I said butter!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!!! The food is consistently delicious!! The staff is very friendly, helpful and attentive! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"We went here the past Tuesday for lunch and I got what I normally order since I am not a fan of pasta, the salmon entree with spinach and potatoes.  The last time I had this was probably last year.

When my food arrived, I was surprised to find that my potatoes were on a small plate while the nicely cooked salmon, placed on top of bed of spinach topped with capers and lemon and herb butter, was on another.  The salmon was as good as I remembered, but the potatoes weren't the same.  Better!  They used to come on the same plate as the salmon and was plain roasted, nothing unique.  But now, they are nice and crisp and WOW, it adds a different texture as an accompaniment to my fish and I am loving this entree more than ever before!

I usually only finish half of this entree but this time around, I finished the entire meal and yes, I was happily full.

Additionally, our waitress provided our party with exceptional service.  Her service is comparable to that of a waitress at Joel Robuchon (I know, bold statement, but she is that wonderful)."}
{"text":"We visit Las Vegas between 2-5 times a year and have never dined at Maggiano's.  

Great place to relax, have a delicious bite and not spend a whole bunch of money.

I had the Chicken Romano and my boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatball.  I wanted to trade dishes with him.  That is the way I enjoy my spaghetti!!  Perfect!!!

Vanessa was our server and she was efficient and friendly.

Only downfall about the visit was the parking lot.  It was full and confusing.  Better if you walk there.

We will visit Maggiano's again, for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on Saturday for my son's birthday which I had already specified on the reservation. Anyways our server was either Mac or Max, can't really remember the name of a server who really wasn't to attentive and didn't even offer refills on our drinks or acknowledge that we were there for a special occasion. When out server brought over the check he asked if we wanted to order dessert and I said well I don't know let's ask the BIRTHDAY BOY? Hello didn't that ring a bell for our server no! He event asked if my son wanted to see the dessert menu! I was thinking this is the moment to redeem yourself and bring over a complementary dessert like the one all the other servers where bringing over to the tables celebrating birthdays!!! Any who I'm rating it a 3 because the food was honestly yummy even though our server sucked (two thumbs down for him) I do recommend this place for good food unfortunately bad service."}
{"text":"Sticker. Sticker. Sticker.

Sticker shock when I saw the bill!

Thank goodness it wasn't my turn. Lol. 

Everything was good. It's in a decent location, to where they can change you premium solely for location, but it's definitely a delight. 

Everything was delicious. The service was exceptional. 

Would definitely dine again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm always happy when I leave, however I am disappointed that they have literally changed every single item that I eat when I come. The filet used to be served in a sort of au jus sauce that is now very similar but almost like its tomato based now, still delicious but I miss the old way they also used to do it also with crispy onion strings on top that were always fresh and tasted so good with the sauce combined but now they are served with the same basic potato wedges you see everywhere. The mashed potatoes don't taste homemade anymore.... Still very good though. The salad was the thing that made me the most sad it used to be made with spinach huge chunks of Gorgonzola, pine nuts onions and vinaigrette. Now it's vinaigrette tiny balls of bleu cheese onions and tiny flakes of prosciutto. The dressing is different but it was amazing so kudos on that. The asparagus is also different it's simply grilled now when it use to be in a lemon tasting sauce. I miss these items so so much but everything they changed it to is still wonderful as well. I will definitely return however now that my favorites are gone I'll be sampling some new menu items.

DO NOT skip dessert the creme brûlée and tiramisu is to die for and worth saving room for. 

Service is always amazing there's valet parking available and of course lots of after dinner shopping available in South Park mall which it's attached to."}
{"text":"We stopped here at the last minute. Managed to get a table quickly on a busy night. Best to get a reservation if you want to go. Pricing is better than most. The food was wonderful. Everything we ordered, including the dessert, was at least a 4/5 rating. The service was excellent. Friendly and just the right amount of attention without hovering. The view of the strip and the Wynn is a nice taste of Las Vegas. The roving musicians I can take or leave. It's a bit coercive when you are asked if you want a song for your lady in front of her, and knowing that they expect payment."}
{"text":"Birthday brunch with 10 friends. Every meal ordered was delicious. Service good and prompt. Convenient location at Downtown Summerlin. Will return for more."}
{"text":"We made dinner reservations to celebrate my husbands birthday. Everything we tasted went above and beyond my expectations. I am fully satisfied and was already thinking of when I could come back again. This immediately moved to my top five favorite restaurants. Our waitress treated us like family. She made us laugh and gave spectacular service. You could really tell that she loved her job. This made our experience much more memorable."}
{"text":"Love their food and atmosphere. It is a great location with a great view of the strip....But the main reason to go is the food.....Excellent!!! The manager is always nice and speaks to us every time we go in....Derrick is a great guy...We also love Nestor as our waiter....you have to try it if you havent!!!"}
{"text":"I tried to make a reservation for Christmas Eve. First, I got transferred to a mailbox that was full and when I called back I talked to 2 or 3 people and waited for several minutes until they told me that they were unable to make a reservation for 5 at 8 pm. That's not how to win friends and influence people."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had our wedding reception here and OMG it was Amazing! Everyone loved the food and all of our guests were satisfied... even the most critical guests. It was a little pricey and more expensive than I originally wanted but it was definitely worth it. The coordination back and forth was a lot of work but I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a good place to have a wedding reception in Vegas that is not as expensive as a hotel ballroom."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant very similar to the one at the Grove in LA! I recommend the chopped salad and the lobster spaghetti!"}
{"text":"My hubby & I hadn't been here for quite awhile.  Went last night and decided we need to come here more often!  The first thing I like about this place is that it takes reservations - for 2.  We don't like waiting, so being able to reserve is a big deal for us.  (Person who answered the phone was also very polite.)  Was glad we had a reservation because it was Saturday night and pretty crowded.  Food and service were very good.  Hubby had the citrus salmon over spinach and I had the parmesean crusted chicken.  His salmon was very tender and a nice size portion.  I went with the \"lighter fare\" which is basically less calories - and I wasn't disappointed.  Chicken was thin and tender and came with an excellent lemon butter sauce that was not too heavy. Our waiter was Sule and was very pleasant.  Attentive without interrupting us.  Finished with the tiramisu which was more than enough to share."}
{"text":"The moment we got to Vegas last weekend, my friend insisted we go to this place.  I really wasn't in the mood for Italian food but the group wanted it, so I was out of luck.

After a rather long wait for a non-buffet restaurant (20-25 min), we were seated.  We got the insalata caprese (although they didn't call it that), and the spinach and feta raviolio and manicotti and finished with the creme brulee.  The portions are rather large, so with a guy and 3 girls, the above menu was enough.

The prices were very fair, especially considering it was Vegas and that it was considered a very good restaurant.  The wine selection was decent.  If you're not in the mood to go bankrupt at Nobu, Lupo, or Postrio, go to Maggiano's for some very reasonable and altogether excellent Italian food in a great setting."}
{"text":"Really disappointing..went here with my wife for a \"date night\" out..first our hostess..a business's first impression..was too busy reading a book to pay attention to anything going on around her..including guests waiting..but she did at least put the book inside one of your wine lists to try and make it look like she had been studying that..hmmm..need to work on being conspicuous..next..we were sat and about 5 minutes later were greeted..I think his name was Dave..very \"blah\" attitude and so quiet when talking that we could not hear anything he was saying..and very very slow service..we had ordered our drinks (peach ice tea and raspberry lemonade) which tasted like pure syrup. We ordered the tomato soup, a Caesar salad, and the bruschetta of which he recommended which had bacon, ricotta, and arugula..this was pretty good. The bread that we got..your \"complementary bread\" he had dropped off at table with olive oil..we had wanted balsamic but could not find our server and couldn't get hostess attention (too busy with her book)..tomato soup tastes out of a can and was watery..with one salad crouton in..really?..it took the server a good 10-15 minutes just to come back to get our entree order..we ordered the chicken and shrimp baked pasta and a carbonara for my wife..the carbonara came out..had good flavor, but sauce was really thin and plate set up was on a 15 inch oval..very poor presentation..looked like a sample amount..mine had zero sauce and was bland..chicken tastes like it was boiled in a pot..we were never checked back on to see how things were..defiantly was a strike out for this restaurant..we have never dined here before, but was told in the past that food was good...food, service, and hospitality was not worth the $70 meal."}
{"text":"I was instantly alarmed when we were seated and I saw food stuck on the empty wine glass in front of me. I could hardly place a drink order with the server because I was so fixated on this overlooked problem. Only compounding the unease, we were placed on the edge of the aisle, the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle ... so I always felt like I was about to fall off my chair. (And this was before the wine!) 

Our server was curt and lacked warmth. I think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when I was ordering. We had to ask twice for butter (over EVOO). However, we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late! (Most every sit-down establishment was was closed except Buca and Maggiano's). 

While it is chain food and has that \"chain\" quality (frozen), it is still filling and occasionally tasty. If you are a vegetarian, be careful! Many of the appetizers (like the stuffed mushrooms) and entrees use chicken-stock for flavor (which is not posted on the menu). We discovered this \"the hard way.\" Ask your server for guidance.

Maggiano's receives high-marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close-down everything but the casinos after 10:30. Nonetheless, the walk to the deserted Fashion Mall (at this hour) is truly harrowing (we saw NO security in this area whatsoever) so go in a large, alert group. Seriously."}
{"text":"Best lemon drop martini around! The food is always fantastic,  the portions are generous, and the service is reasonably fast even on the busiest Saturday night. The Marco's Meal for Two is a great deal since you get lunch for tomorrow as well."}
{"text":"I went here for my 21st birthday dinner. Thankfully it was in walking distance from my hotel. The food was amazing, everyone in my party (party of 11) loved what they got and devoured it. I ordered the Linguine de Mare and it was amazing. I also heard great things about the spaghetti, my friend said it reminded her of the way her grandma would make it. The service was good, and I enjoyed being serenaded for my birthday by the cutest old man playing the guitar. Overall very pleased with my experience."}
{"text":"We came here on a non-busy evening with no reservations and we were seated right away. Our servers was Ceci, and she is the sweetest thing ever. We had a great experience with her. She was very helpful and informative. We haven't been to Maggiano's in a while so she gave us a few updates. 
The restaurant interior is nice, well kept and in a great location.  We had a great experience and the food was good too. Both my husband and I were impressed. The water kept getting filled before it was empty, our plates and food were hot when we received it. I know these things are expected but you would be surprised to how many restaurants we go to and the food is just warm. Overall we would come here again, familiar tasty food in a great location.  Thank you Ceci for the cookies!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food, incredible service and a great atmosphere! Besides, who doesn't love to hear Frank Sinatra in the background?

We love this place! We usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor, a hearty serving and tasty! A few things I would recommend, the Maggiano's Salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! The flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks. 

Even if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! We ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect. 

We will definitely be back. Salute!"}
{"text":"Just went recently during restaurant week with my boyfriend and this visit was even better than the last! Food was delicious, and lasted us for a week and our server was awesome. We had the \"Marco's Meal\" which is a great value. $39.99 for an appetizer, two entrees to eat there, two entrees to take home and a dessert to share. I would definitely recommend this as a great place for date night."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant expecting a positive experience, but ended with a terrible one. First and foremost, the wine is incredibly overpriced. Some of the nicer restaurants in uptown Charlotte have better wine options for about half the price per glass. Besides that, my food came out completely wrong and instead of having a manager apologize, I waited 15 minutes while my date sat anxiously waiting to eat the food placed in front of him. Needless to say, by the time my food came out, his was cold. Both of our dishes were EXTREMELY salty. Horrendous to be exact. I could barely stomach my food but was so hungry, I forced it down. The pasta was flavorless and seemed to have just been tossed in oil. The chicken tasted of nothing other than salt. I would hate to see how many grams of sodium were actually in that dish. It was unbearable. It was sad that a manager never came by to apologize for the terrible evening we had or the fact that our food was wrong. Our server also didn't seem to be alarmed by the fact that neither of us had silverware until she noticed us both looking around confused. Check was well over 100 dollars, the food was worth maybe 5 at best. Will not recommend this restaurant or be returning."}
{"text":"I wish I would of found this place sooner in Las Vegas. From the moment that we sat down it was great, immediately we had someone offering their specials and keeping us entertained while our server was busy. Food was amazing, I love italian food and I wish we had a place like this in SWFL.  

Their portions is enough for 2 & trust me I eat a lot! If we compare the food & prices to other places, you must go here. Usually a plate of food in Vegas is in the range of $30-$60. Margianno is definitely affordable  $20-$30 per plate. Remember they serve a lot & please ask the server they are really helpful.

Would totally recommend Margianno's!!!"}
{"text":"Part of me really does not understand the popularity of this place, given all the great independent Italian restaurants in the area.  I have been here multiple times, usually with medium size groups.  Its family style menu makes it easy to book groups.  The family style menus help with groups as well.  The prices are a bit steep, unless you want the bare basics.  There are three price ranges for groups, with the lowest price giving you cookies only for dessert and the highest giving you the full range of entrees.  One thing we found unusual a few years ago, when we booked a gathering in December, is that they wanted you to preselect your menu items before you arrived in order to keep the kitchen going and minimize your wait.  Really, it was a way to keep groups moving through quicker by providing quicker turnover.  Service has ranged from great to marginal through all of our experiences.  The ambience is quiet and classy.  Also, for a modern chain restaurant, I find it a bit unusual that all rest rooms are on the second floor.  Regarding the food, it ranges from fair to very good.  We have ordered the mussels on several occasions.  They taste great, but a significant proportion of them arrive unopened.  The fried mozzarella and zucchini are larger than any place you might imagine.  Salads are generally good and flavorful.  The salmon dishes are quite good.  Pastas are good and the meatballs are huge.  The desserts are quite good, with the Tiramisu and cakes being very nice.  Portions are huge, and you will likely be going home with food.  When you just look at the food and service, it is not much different from other Italian food chains.  Again, this is OK for groups because of convenience, but I would not go here for a night out with a small party.  There are better choices for that."}
{"text":"I generally try to avoid chain restaurants, but I always cave for Maggiano's and I am never disappointed.  Maggiano's is our go-to place for take out when we have family in town and I don't feel like cooking for the masses and everyone is always pleased.  Tonight I decided to brave Maggiano's alone.  With four children.  Props to the hostess - she didn't blink an eye and assured me she had the perfect spot \"out of the way\" for me and my brood.  

I have a daughter with celiac disease (no gluten!) so Maggiano's might seem like an odd choice for us but they serve gluten free pasta!  The last time we were visiting with a rather large party, the chef even came out to check on us and see who had the gluten sensitivity and if we had any questions about food preparation.  My daughter was beaming.  

Tonight I ordered eggplant parm off the classic pasta menu and currently if you order off the classic pasta menu you get to choose another pasta menu item to bring home - my working husband was very pleased to come home to DELICIOUS gnocchi in vodka sauce even though he missed our dinner out.  Drinks for myself and the kiddos came out quickly and our server was very accomodating - one of my children ordered the grilled chicken breast with garlic mashed potatoes - \"but no chicken, please.\"  The waitress thoughtfully suggested we just order a side of mashed potatoes instead.  The children's menu has a lot of variety and includes a drink and dessert with their meal - all for $5.95 - it really can't be beat.  The servings are enormous and my son is the only one who can actually finish his meal.  I am pleased to say that not only was dinner taken care of this evening, but lunch for tomorrow is covered as well.  

I think our bill was about $34 - no complaints here!  Definitely check out Maggiano's - very family friendly, very helpful staff, and, of course, delicious food."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this location several times, and have been more than satisfied each time. Service has been outstanding.  Food is very good, well above typical chain quality but at a reasonable price.  I love their lasagna, and getting a take home with it is a great deal."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant, I was with a party of about 15.  I started off with a side ceasars salad and the baked ziti which was quite good and filling. Our server Anna and her young male helper who brought our drinks and desserts were on the ball and top notch, especially with dealing with such a large party and their other tables. They were a joy! I will be back."}
{"text":"I visited the Summerlin location with numerous other family members. The food was not very tasty. I had Some sort of chefs choice pasta dish that was not very flavorful. I ordered meatballs on the side that were tasteless. The waitstaff was great. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Here  on vacation, and me and my parents decided to give this place a shot.   Great service great food.  The banans split cheesecake  and tiramisu were home made.  I would recommend  this place."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food is very good like most Maggiano's. Service is fast. They also do a great job of getting parties seated as quickly as possible. I always stop in this location when I am at the mall. Order the chicken parm...it's always good."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here during our honeymoon in Vegas. We shared a portion of salad, liguine with clams and a couple of glasses of wine. The food tasted great! We made a reservation before we arrived, which recommend for a Friday night in Vegas. The server was nice and attentive so our experience here was positive. I would come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I, along with our couple friends, stopped by Maggiano's as we were walking down The Strip. We ordered the Tomato Caprese for an appetizer that was very tasty, The dishes are massive in portion and the food is delicious!. Ordered the mozzarella and it was  delicious. Had the New York Strip Steak and the Veal Porterhouse and split both of them. The NY Strip and  the Veal Porterhouse was absolutely wonderful. It was perfectly grilled and  tender. Remember they  serve nice big portions so please share them.
They always have Sinatra playing in the background.
Two people were roaming playing songs for you."}
{"text":"Omg, was I so surprised when Maggiano didn't live up to its name.  I was starving, like always! I ordered the salmon......

Yuck!!!! It was dry and the lemon butter they poured over it separated so the butter was lumpy.... the starter salad was saturated with creamy Caesar dressing which I wouldn't have mind if the lettuce wasn't wilted and brown.


I have been to Maggiano's in East coast and the food was great but that was also 3 years ago.  

It's like I always say \"treat the customer like it's there first time at your establishment.\"   We are the most important part of any restaurant moving forward and making a name for itself.  I like to be treated like it's a first date all the time, do what you did when I first sat down at your table. 

Remember when the waiter was attentive, the salmon was so juicy and tender you could cut it with a fork instead of a knife. 

Remember when the butter was silky smooth and you could pour it over your salmon like hot gravy.

Remember when the salad was  crisp and fresh, it seemed like you had a farmer's market in your kitchen. 

Maggiano's take me back down memory lane this Maggiano's isn't what I remember..... please take me back or I wouldn't be Back!"}
{"text":"Located conveniently in the Fashion Show mall, this is a good place to eat if you're tired from shopping and hungry for average Italian food. It is a chain so don't expect very authentic home style Italian. I had the tomato soup and it was pretty good. And the sangria was pretty good. The pumpkin cheesecake was super sweet and not very good. It was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Our last night in town we wanted to get away from the 'casino experience'. This restaurant certainly does this and more...especially the part where the dinner tab sticker shock comes into play.  You won't get that here.

Noel our server was money!  With a sense of urgency he made my petite, red headed passion flower and I aware the Happy Hour was in full swing for just a short period of time.  With this very subtle hint we ordered the Coppla Rosso and Chardonnay by the glass.  These wines complimented our meals very nicely.   I ordered the Rigatoni  D.  This came with pasta, herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms and caramelized onions, tossed in a Marsala cream sauce.  Very generous portion.  Awesome!  My PRHPF ordered the Baked Ziti and pronounced it to be very good!  For what we had in mind for an Italian dinner this exceeded our expectations.

For desert we kept it pretty low key..Italian lemon cookies were perfect.  There was no way we were gonna be able to enjoy desert properly as we were stuffed.

This very nice wedding anniversary dinner was over the top because our server Noel was polished and engaging at every moment.  Easy to talk to and a keen sense of humor, we couldn't help but like this guy.  He truly made this a 5 star moment for us.  I can't wait to take my Best Girl to our local Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this Maggiano's. Made a 7:15 reservation but still had to wait 20 min to get seated. Ordered salads..it's obvious the wait person forgot about us because the salads were warm and swimming in oil.....Even though Two people were waiting on our table the service was still sub par..... had to ask for water refills.

The highlight of the evening, the moms lasagna! Excellent! 

Not sure what the deal was with the wait staff...I have visited other Maggiano's in the SE..always on point with service...this one, not so much. they were not on top of their game last night but I would go again for the food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, big bowls of pasta :) you can either be seated or seat yourself on the patio or high tables. Casual wear. Would recommend for a casual nice dinner out :)"}
{"text":"We had an incredible experience at Maggiano's.  The food was amazing with generous proportions. As it was our first visit we were treated to a free appetite and ate some of the best zucchini fritte we've ever had. We were there for lunch and recommend the Honey Mustard Salmon Club, which is only available before 3pm. The Four Cheese Ravioli was delicious as well. A visit from the chef topped off our visit. While we don't live nearby,  we plan on visiting again and are excited to show this great restaurant off to others. We're sure they'll be as impresses as we were."}
{"text":"This was probably the best meal of my trip.  We got there a little late in the evening so there was no wait, which is always nice.  Their portions are HUGE and you get a really good deal for what you pay for.

We got the sampler platter which is enough food by itself for three people.  We had a salad and soup and some other dish and everything was great.  The staff waited on us hand and foot and we had the most adorable waiter too!

What a nice surprise to find in the Fashion Mall.  I will be back here the next time that I'm in Vegas.  Why spend tons of money in the hotels when this place is far better!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Maggiano's once and it was alittle more than a year ago. I got a coupon to go there and the looks of the restaurant has always intrigued me to try it.

The waiter was awesome. He was friendly and nice and just a perfect waiter that made this experience alittle bit better.

However, I ordered their classic pasta and their beef lasagna. The pasta was nothing special but edible and their beef lasagna did NOT look appetizing. It was just a big blob of brown meat on a plate. And even more, it didn't taste good at all that the friend I was with took about three bites and couldn't finish it. 

Overall, I may think about coming back here to give it a second chance. But based on my first and last time there, it did not impress me at all."}

Had another Great dinner here last night
I had center cut filet and for a Itilian restaurant it
was one of the best I had
My companion has veal piccca which was also excellent 
Our server William was very very good and knew the menu
Our wine was also very good and priced correctly 
One of the nice things this restaurant is doing is donating 
money to \"make a wish\" foundation nice touch
We ordered a special dessert that would donate $$ to the foundation 
Highly recommend this restaurant 
Will go back as often as I can 



Had dinner here last night with my niece
She ordered The lobster carbonara and I ordered the chicken  piccata both were excellent
Out server Bryanna and trainee Cory were both 
excellent
I happened to mention it was my nieces Birthday and along with our regular dessert strawberry cobbler they brought us a plate of lemon cookies with a candle for my niece
That was above and beyond 
Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with a nice quiet ambience that presents the image of fine dinging We dined with friends last evening.  The food was good not great but there were drawbacks that marred the dining experience. My wife's water glass was dirty and had to be replaced. My friend's martini glass had a crack in it and had to be replaced. Our server arrived promptly at our table and explained the wine of the evening. I preferred bourbon and requested a BasilHayden and he was not familiar with it. After sharing a few he knew (Makers Mark and Jack Daniel) he said, let me check. He came back to let me know that indeed they did have BH. A few moments later he came back to let me know it was not in stock. I ordered a different bourbon. When our orders were taken I asked him about a special, the filet with mushroom risotto specifically the size of the filet. He said it was about 6 to 8 ounces. I had ordered the salmon cake special appetizer which he said was large so I didn't need a huge steak. When the salmon cake arrived, the runner inquired who ordered it! When our orders arrived, my empty appetizer plate was still in front of me leaving the runner perplexed as to where she should place my dish. She put it on the edge of the table removed the appetizer plate and served. She had to inquire who ordered each dish. Servers and runners should correctly place dishes without asking who ordered what. My filet with risotto was anything but. Turned out to be a bowl of mushroom risotto, topped with 5 tiny pieces of filet perhaps no more than 2 ounces of protein. I called the server over and showed this to him, He lamely responded that he thought I had inquired about a different filet although there is no question that I had inquired about the special of the night. He did, however offer to correct this by bringing another dish or another piece of steak but I declined. Basically, my dish was a tasty risotto with a small dash of filet. It did not live up to the expectations of the description on the menu nor the server's explanation. Overall, all our dishes were good, but none were excellent or truly exceptional. The not above average food plus the deficiencies in service would make me want to rush back."}
{"text":"The service was okay, had to ask the waiter for a refill on water after waiting nearly 10 minutes. The calamari was soggy but the portion was large. The tomato and basil soup was eh, but the Taylor Street Baked Ziti wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I know this is not an authentic Italian place, but some of their dishes are just the BOMB. Like the Rigatoni D - omg and their Penne with meat sauce - I don't know... I just love love love it. It so hits the spot. 

I make crazy good pasta sauces all the time so I am a skeptic but sometimes even the commercialized stuff can be tasty."}
{"text":"Love this location, the food is WAY better than the one on the strip. Momma's Lasagna is delicious, I ordered the Filet/asparagus Risotto last time we visited and it was the perfect portion and the filet was perfectly cooked. As an appetizer we ordered the risotto bites which were great, along with the fried mozzarella and marinara but they came out kind of cold but were good. Also the butter cake, was amazing! One of the best desserts I've had at a restaurant. The waiters are always very attentive and friendly even when its busy. Love coming here and will be back!"}
{"text":"Maggianos has a great dinner time environment. We sat by the windows facing the strip and it was really beautiful to have the dark dining room looking out towards the bright LV strip. 

The food was excellent and exactly what it should be at this price point. The food is not homemade but I think that's pretty apparent by the fact that it is in a Mall. It is however made to order and above the quality of most other chain restaurants.

Tiramisu here was the best I have ever had. I am still pretty new to tiramisu as I have only had it about five times but wow is it really good here. I will probably stop in just for the tiramisu every time I go shopping at fashion show. Make sure and try it."}
{"text":"Maggiano's has always been one of my favorite restaurants. This location has always provided quality and friendly service. I've always felt welcomed when coming in. Atmosphere is very nice and sophisticated. Fried zucchini is absolutely amazing. For smaller meals I recommend one of the flatbreads, if looking for a more fulfilling meal the four cheese ravioli is perfect, finished off with better Tiramisu then you would find in NYC Little Italy."}
{"text":"If you want some delicious Italian food that is a step up from your typical Olive Garden, this is your place. My family has come here for years and we always have a great time. We've used the banquet rooms, the small group room (\"wine room\"), and the dining room, and we've had great experiences everywhere. 
My favorite thing about Magg is that when you eat one meal there, you take food home and eat it for the next 3 days. Literally. One dish is easily enough for 2 people, and then if you get a pasta, they give you a second one to take home! It's crazy! And their pasta is good quality too. They use Barilla for the most part, and they have gluten free and whole wheat options for all pastas which is nice. Sauces are gluten free too! 
It is a bit more expensive than a local Italian restaurant would be, but it's worth it. Plus they have a Meal for 2 deal that includes an appetizer, 2 entrees (+2 more to take home!) and a dessert. I can assure you that you will leave there fat and happy no matter what you order, but just to give a shout out to my personal favorite menu items:

Fried zucchini for an appetizer. It comes with a lemon-y ranch like dipping sauce that is amazing.
The chopped salad. Comes with blue cheese, avocado, prosciutto, and a house dressing that is the greatest. It's literally my favorite salad anywhere.
Rigatoni D as an entree. Pasta with herbed chicken, mushrooms, and sauteed onions in a marsala cream sauce. It is DELICIOUS.
Zuccota cake for dessert. It's their signature dessert, and when it arrives at your table, you'll see why. It's chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ganache on top in a serving that is large enough for an entire family. Although it's not exactly fat free, it's heavenly.

Ok that's all, I'm done raving, but seriously, if you like Italian food, do yourself a favor and go to Maggiano's next time you're in Beachwood! I promise it's better than your usual Cheesecake Factory experience."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place at the Fashion Show location, so when they opened up the street we were excited to try. We finally got around to it and went for early dinner Sunday at about 5:30. Not a long wait and the place was packed. Let me sum it up like this...If you like overpriced, chain style, Italian in oversized portions lacking quality, this place is for you. If you're like me and steer clear of any type of Italian chain then don't expect much. We love the other Italian place in DTS, so we might be spoiled by their more authentic Italian food. 

Waitress was friendly and like many other reviewers explained, she reviewed the ENTIRE menu. She took our drink and apps order and my wine was still not served half way through eating the apps. I would have liked balsamic for my bread but I couldn't wait that long. Fried Mozzarella was meh. I typically would never order fried cheese as an appetizer, but I left it up to the husband and kid so that's what we got. Sauce was terrible and had no flavor, I've had better from a jar.  The Italian Salad - the greens were very tasty, and I don't like my salad over dressed but this was under dressed. 

Entries-  My husband ordered Veal parm and 3 bites in, we realized it was chicken. Our waitress wasn't in sight, so we called someone else over who brought over a veal immediately. Maybe the waitress grabbed the wrong dish or maybe it was the kitchen's fault? We don't know but they resolved it quickly. Hence the two stars. I ordered Frutti Di Mare but asked for Angel Hair. It came out with Linguini. By the time the waitress checked on us, I had eaten several muscles, so I opted to keep the dish as is. Not awful but nothing special. No authentic flavors. Very bland.  I was able to resist eating the pasta. Only 2 shrimp, mostly muscles with a few clams. No lobster in my dish. Kids cheese pizza; the worst I've ever tried. Super thin which I personally love, but I really think they forgot the cheese. Tasted more like a super thin (i mean thin like paper) flat bread without cheese and without anything on it. Absolutely awful. 

Went to bathroom twice, both times no towels for hands. 

We got the bill and I asked the waitress, why I was asked if we were celebrating anything on the way in, but it was never acknowledged or asked about after dinner. She apologized and brought Tiramisu for my husband's b-day celebration.  I believe our server was good, but was in the \"weeds\" as we used to say. She probably had too many tables, so her attention to our table was lacking. My water was never refilled, so I drank my husband's. Service at other Italian places we frequent is exceptional and super attentive (see my other reviews). At first glance this seems like a good deal with prices, but we prefer quality over quantity. I can understand why a lot of people might like the huge portions and this type of dining, but it's not our type of place. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Loved it!! I was VERY pleased with dinner and my time here at Maggiano's.  I had about a 15 minute wait for a table, which was no big deal.  Once seated I was greeted by an amazing server.  A kind Italian man, who was very efficient.  This place was extremely clean with a wonderful atmosphere.  

This may be a chain, but I didn't know that until reading reviews before I posted my own.  They do not come off as a chain restaurant to me.  Now compare them to Olive Garden....Not really anything to compare!!  Maggiano's takes it hands down.  The food was rich and tasty.  Salad was decent size, with an amazing dressing that had a touch of spiciness.  I ordered a few glasses of wine and the bill came to around $60.  Definitely worth the money!! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since we have visited and to be honest living father away is the main reason . Thankfully with gift cards this made this visit a reality. Reserve if you can since they do take reservations and on the weekends they are busy! I still love that they still offer the two for one meal listing in the menu! I was super excited to order the spaghetti and meatball with meat sauce meal! The calorie count was at another level but the flavors of the food is super delicious! 
I did also have a glass of wine to compliment the red sauce. No ice tea at this event, maybe next time! Overall quality of the food was super and the meals came out in under ten minutes. What was even better was the take home of the additional order of the spaghetti and meatballs for the next day. I really appreciated how the manager or general manager came up to us individually and ask about our food and experience!"}
{"text":"My family took me to Maggiano's for my birthday this weekend.  What a horrible experience.  We had reservations so no problem getting in, although they sat us about 15 minutes after our reservation time (not a big deal).  The service was extremely slow.  Our waitress said they were catering a banquet for over 100 people next door that same evening so not sure if that factored into things.  There were four of us in the party and two ordered the surf 'n turf special on the menu.  We waited what seemed like 45 minutes for them to bring our entrees out. The two of us that ordered the special were very disappointed.  They didn't get the temperature right on either of our meats and the lobster tail was not cooked enough.  We told the waitress and the manager came by and said they would make them the right way.  Another 45 minutes later (I kid you not) and they finally brought out our plates.  I could not understand why re-doing our dinners was not made a priority with the kitchen.. seeing them serve all the other tables around us seemed to be more important to them.  The only saving grace was that they comped the entire meal.  Needless to say we won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Favorite place for Italian food by far! The food here is amazing every time and you can't help but want more. Even the bread they give you is delicious. For appetizers we got the Fried Zucchini and Calamari, both of which were fantastic. The Calamari is past time I had it tasted a little fishy, but not to a point that was unappetizing. My go to is the Gnocchi with Sausage (without the cheese on top). It is the most flavorful pasta dish I've ever have and I will never stop wanting to eat it. Spumoni (Italian tri-flavored gelato) for dessert, and it was a perfect finish. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"The peach Bellini drink is to die for!!!! Great service and great prices on the buy one take one menu. I will always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Maggiano's never fails: good food, good service, and the family-style serving makes for a great night out with friends or, well, family. Every time I've been out to eat at this location, I end up talking to someone new. Megan V. mentioned talking to folks at a table near her own, which has been my experience as well. Normally, I can be kind of a snot about talking with strangers, but somehow the vibe in Maggiano's makes it ok. It's a good thing.

The staff is fast and friendly, and the prices aren't bad considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We hosted our Wedding Reception at Maggiano's Las Vegas. It was the perfect place for our wedding reception! Cassy was extremely helpful and always responded to my emails in a timely fashion. I also appreciated how she genuinely cared that I was getting the most for my money. She made great suggestions about how to spend the money toward our room minimum. The workers at Maggiano's did a fantastic job setting up our reception. It looked even better than I had imagined it would. There was SO MUCH food and it was all delicious! My guests all loved the food and some said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding. This venue is a one stop shop, they referred me to a great DJ, bakery, florist, and limo service too! Thank you so much to everyone at Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Very sad, been saving the visit for my wife's birthday ,as I have been told it was a great place for service and food, the evening started out very nice, Mike at the bar was a joy, the drinks were great we then went to our table ordered a appetizer and had a glass of wine also asked for bread, got the wine, appetizer arrived in good time wife was happy, no bread
Waitress arrived took our dinner order, told us bread was still in the oven, ok we ordered a salad before our dinner, now 20 minutes goes by now no salad no bread, no waitress ask another staff member for my waitress, where is the salad, and the hot bread, all of a sudden here is the salad cold bread and my dinner all at once, so I say this is not working the service is unacceptable it sucks she storms off a runner comes by gets in my face,,what do you want me to do, get away from me so he leaves.manager comes what did you do to my waitress, I tell him my story, okay I'm going to have a new person serve you,I could go on but it won't do any good don't think I am going back we are locals and they are used to guest that Will never come back cause they are tourists and don't care back to Perino's"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about the staff and food here at Maggianos.  As an event planner I have helped organize small events in their private dining areas and the service is always incredible.  I have to say a special thank you to Beth and Sabrina for their great communication and willingness to go above and beyond.  I have had so many things to eat here and everything is always delicious , the family style meals are also perfect for larger parties. ( You get to try a little bit of everything ).  If you are looking to host a private party or even stop by for some great Italian , this is your place !"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch or dinner. The meals were made from scratch and the hard work of the chef is proven in the taste. Try everything and I really mean that.  While the atmosphere is family orientated it is still a great place to take a date and have a nice drink."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars..but our waiter..EVERY time he poured me water, he spilled it. Only mine. -__- 

First time was a big ass spill..next one went on my bread..third one went on my meal. Come on maaayynn. 

BUT THE FOOD WAS BOMB DIGGITY!

Went to Maggiano's for me, and 2 other friend's birthday dinner with everyone! They have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food. But it's all you can eat. Doesn't really explain much,  but if you have a big group..I would suggest that you get that. (Although we didn't order it..lol) 

Service was pretty good. We got some toasty warm bread (yum) and their butter is so  yums!

I ended up ordering the chicken & spinach manicotti. SOOO CREAMY..SO DELIIICIOUS! Comes in 3 decent sized pieces, and I just wanted to savor every bite. 

It's really quiet in there..none of the other customers talk, so for the most part, my friends and I were the entertainment of the night. 

We were seated in the back right corner, so we are able to see the other hotels and what not. All of a sudden, we see 4 cop cars chasing this white car, and it stopped right in front of our view. All of us got up and it was so intense!!!  The police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground. Ohmygah. That was good stuff. 

Also, I can't fail to mention..we all got to go boxes and bags..and we took some pictures outside. This was towards the hotels, so away from Maggiano's. My friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her Coach wristlet inside. We were all facing away..when we were done with the picture, she asked where her bag was. We had no idea.. I said to not worry, cause it's just her food..but none of us knew her credit card, iD, and other important things were in it. 

ANYONE could've taken it! LUCKILY. One of our friends saw 2 homeless men downstairs carrying a Maggiano's bag, and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and Coach wristlet! 

Friend's bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said, \"GIMME THAT BAG!\" & the homeless guy was pissed, but gave it back. If it wasn't for our one friend who saw him, we would've never found it. 

Just wanted to share the crazy experiences from Maggiano's :] 

But I would definitely suggest this place! It's really good. Tried all of my friend's food..and perfecto!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for a wedding reception. The service and the food was great. We had crab cakes, a choice of 2 salads, and mozzarella sticks for the first course. 

Second course was meatballs and spaghetti, lemon and herb salmon, chicken piccata and steamed veggies. 

Third course was cheesecake and chocolate cake. I didn't taste the chocolate cake but the cheesecake was amazing! 

I would recommend this location if in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's Maggiano's , of course it is good, just like the location in Costa Mesa and the one by Red Rock.  They have some of the best stuffed mushrooms and flatbread pizzas among other great pastas and meat dishes.  Never gone wrong on anything I have ordered, chicken parmesan, lasagna, etc.  If you have room try the lemon cookies, so good."}
{"text":"I've been sick for the last week and was soooo sick of liquids and soups that I wanted something hearty. I always somehow or another crave pasta; ALWAYS! So decided to have lunch here and get some Nordstrom shopping done.

Other than pasta, I had been craving fish. Luckily, the waitress sealed the deal on my dish when she said I could substitute my potatoes with pasta. So, I got the grilled salmon with lemon and thyme, sauteed spinach (with pasta and garlic and olive oil). 
It was sooooo good. Exactly what I had been craving. Fresh and light tasting fish with my pasta fix!

Friend had their \"famous Rigatoni D\" which is pretty delicious. Rigatoni and penne pasta have to be my favorite kinds of pasta. Prolly because I hate having to \"slurp\" up the long stringy pastas. And mushrooms and onions added to the ringatoni always make for deliciousness and a happy Laurie =)

With it being cold lately, it was nice to end the lunch with some tea. I think I had some apricot or peach tea and friends had the peppermint tea. Great that they had big tea collection.

The service was prolly the best I've ever had there. Had to tip the waitress well just based on her refilling my waters like crazy that day. Kept having to tell her that I was really thristy and sorry for always coming back for refills."}
{"text":"i came here for my birthday last month and i had the most amazing experience. the food is great and the service is amazing everyone was very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. the enviornment is great too,  and they have this guy singing at the tables he is a really good singer and very friendly.i really like the idea of having him entratain the people in the restaurant. i cant wait to go back to vegas just to go to this place again!"}
{"text":"We enjoy dining at Maggiano's and this location was absolutely amazing. The team is extremely customer service oriented.  Gave us a free welcome appetizer since it was our first time there. Even offered something different for the kids (a single ravioli).  Super nice people, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. Our server, Rafael, was so helpful. He made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves. 
We reserved online, got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes.

Rafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire - different noodle, sauce, substitution of an ingredient, etc. So we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels. Came out totally delicious. Appetizers were $4 until 6:30pm so we ordered italian sausage flatbread. Delicious! We were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the Tiramisu - our favorited. Rafael suggested the sampler Tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price. We went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion. Again it was perfect. 
Rafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows. 
Our experience was fantastic. We couldn't stop talking about it to our family and will try Maggiano's in San Jose"}
{"text":"Family style is the best way to go. It's all you can eat and every plate refill is just as good as the first. For an all you can eat setting, the quality is outstanding. 
This is our go to place for special family dinners and nights out with friends."}
{"text":"This used to be 1 of my Favorite restaurants over the past few years the quality and service has  severely went down hill. After my last terrible experience on Valentines night 2015, I decided give Maggiano's a try in hope that my Birthday experience would be better. Unfortunately it wasn't. From the waitress being slack with service and refills \"due to lack of communication\" and the food was just not good. I ordered ziti with no meat and got noodles and sauce with no flavor, my boyfriend ordered the chicken Alfredo which was extremely bland with no flavor. We ordered the Marco Meal for 2 and the best part of the meal was the starter mozzarella marinara and the apple crostada. I am extremely sad to say this was THE LAST visit I will ever waste my time or special occasion on Maggiano's. I hope they go back to their traditional values to ensure every guest has a great experience."}
{"text":"The service was first class at Maggiano's last night! We sat inside, the restaurant was dimly lit, warm and inviting. We had a great view of the strip with light and water shows, lots of eye candy to entertain us. The calamari was lightly breaded and just right, not at all chewy. The caesar salad was crisp and fresh. I had the salmon on a bed of spinach and side of angel hair pasta paired with a Sonoma Chardonnay. The angel hair pasta was done with oil, garlic and butter and was delicious. It was a nice dish and perfect pairing recommended by our server. There was so much food that we all had leftovers to take home to our room. My friends ordered their regular dishes (they've been here many times before- chicken parmigiana and rigatoni D) and they were not disappointed. There was no room for dessert after fresh bread with oil and vinegar, calamari, salad and our meals. The food was good and the ambiance and service really made the experience. Shout out to Nestor and his excellent service last night!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent.  Ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course I had the spinach and chicken manicotti.  Fortunately, I also got to try the linguine di mare and the chicken parmesan that my party ordered.  They were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite.  

This is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions, so it's definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping.  Be sure to call in advance otherwise you'd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated.  Ask for a table next to the window with view of LVBlvd, not one of the best, but still a pretty sight for you out of towners."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and loved all the food we ordered! My the server was nice it was our wedding anniversary celebration and we got some special treats too! I ordered the one on the picture and it was so delicious! Yum yum. I love how it all went good laughs, good food and great company! I would definitely come back and bring my mom next time."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Came to Vegas and didn't want a basic buffet so I found this place and it was so worth it. I got the four cheese ravioli with pesto Alfredo and I added shrimp. Wow! So good!! I even searched if there were any other location outside of Nevada closer to me cause I definitely want to go there again soon."}
{"text":"So many good expectations... heard so many good things about it. 
The places was packed and required reservation so I figured it had a good reason. 
Ordered the chicken marsala. 
An appetizer in the form of dry bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar arrived and provided the first hint. 
Now for the chicken marsala.... first, the sauce tasted nothing like marsala, it tasted like the good amount of caramelized onion that was in it and that's it. The breading tasted 2-3 weeks old with freezer flavor and the chicken it self was extremely hard as if it was boiled in water for 2 hours. This was very surprising considering the fact the place was very packed and you wouldn't think they cook food in large batches and keep it frozen for days/weeks. 
I haven't been to any other Maggiano's and want to believe they are much better. In general, restaurants in Vegas are not based on return customers so they let them selves slack. (I did eventually found good Italian food there though)"}
{"text":"Called earlier in the night to ask for reservations, they had late reservations available but said walk ins are approx 30 mins so we decided to do a walk in seating. We had 6 in our group so we took two cars to the venue. I arrived earlier than the rest of my party hoping to put our name down but the hostess wouldn't let us since the \"majority\" of our party was not present...keep in mind we were told the wait would be 40 mins and my party was only 15 mins behind me. I assumed this wasn't the hostess' rule so I shrugged it off. When my party arrived we put our name in and we're told it would be 40 mins max so we had a drink at the bar while we wait. I was supposed to get a text when the table was ready but over an hour (maybe 1hr 15m) had passed now. We check with the hostess and she couldn't find our party on the list. We give her the phone number  and she seemed to try to make it look like she found the party all of a sudden. We were then seated minutes later on their \"indoor patio\", basically tables set up inside the mall.  We were seated at a very small table (felt like a kids table) so we asked to switch tables, which the hostess hesitantly directed us to a table right next to ours. Not a great experience before we even were able to look at the menu.

The food was alright, not worth the price or service experienced. The waiter was very nice but the hostesses all seemed to have an attitude. 

The only reason I would go back is the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I ordered a chopped salad, it was wilted and watery.
This was the first time I have been to Maggiano's and I think it will be the last. The waiter was nice but the service was very slow. This was around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, the bread was good, the sausage and peppers were ok , I've had much better. The salad I could not believe, I would have sent it back, but the waiter did not come back to our table until a half hour later, by that time I just pick over the salad because I was hungry. ( I could not get his attention). The salad was awful a waste of my money."}
{"text":"Best lunch deals and quality #authentic #Italian food! And they give a complimentary dish to take home for later. BEST experience EVER!"}
{"text":"I don't  even know where to begin. I guess lets start with the decor. The outside and the immediate entrance gives you the vibe that you should be walking into a 5 star restaurant, a Mortons or a Capital Grill. Then you start to people watch as you wait for your table and see a varied group to say the least. You see the suits, the older Scottsdale women on dates with their husbands, then you see the working class that didn't feel the need to dress up.. wearing denim shirts, jeans, work boots..Maybe they don't know any better? Makes me cringe like when people wear jeans to the Nutcracker. Then you have the wanna be eminiem, baggy jeans, hat, overstuffed sports apparel jacket taking his trashy lady (wearing a micro mini jean skirt and heels in 50 degree weather and rain.)out for the night. Lets just say this crowd does not go together, only in a train station, would be the best way to describe it...a people watching extravaganza.

The dining room: where you would have expected white tablecloths you will find checkered? I guess its supposed to be a throwback to small Italian restaurants back in the day...but its more like it was supposed to be a BBQ joint and at the last minute they changed their minds. White tablecloths would have turned the dining room up a notch in class there is no doubt. Plus the kids yelling up and down the stairs doesn't help. Do people not know how to control their kids anymore? You're not at Chuckie Cheese! Ugh.. pet peeve.

The waiters apparently really dumb down the menu for you. Not that it's a bad thing but they will explain what pancetta, arrabiatta, orecchiette, fra diavolo, risotto, etc without prompting. So be patient if you are well versed in italian foods, there are a lot of people out there that just aren't. So Bravo for educating the masses! if you're trying to impress a date, and you have no idea, you will not embarrass yourself here.

The menu, the prices match the tablecloths? Walking in you would have expected Mastros pricing, that is not the case..Youre looking at Bucca Di Beppo pricing.. $13 - $22 a plate. Now for the bigger shock.you're looking at  Claim Jumper portions! My fellow Yelper (Nick S) ordered a FULL order and when it came out it was ridiculous. His Bowl was comparable to...you know those giant Christmas Center Piece bowls that people fill with christmas ornaments? It was like that. His full order could have easily served 5! I had the half order and it was at least 2.5 servings and his dwarfed mine. Its well worth the pricing..

Now for the food... I started with the House Salad which could have been a dinner salad easily.It was very good except for the  unnecessary giant pepperoncini in the middle of it. I ordered the Rigatoni D and it was above average.. the mushrooms were the best part, absolutely amazing. It could have used some extra flavor such as lemon or crushed red pepper and the sauce could have been thicker but it was far from awful. (I had some leftovers a few hours later and it was MUCH better the 2nd time)Nick had the same reaction from his dish. We also had dessert and I was thrilled with the spumoni..no dried ....substitute chocolate chunks. He had the apple frittata and it left him quivering..lol He LOVED it.

My summary is its like someone dressed up and put makeup on Buca. Dont be fooled by the decor.. this is not a 5 star restaurant. But it is well worth it for the food, the service, the price and the people watching! Great for business lunches/dinners, catching up with a friend, taking the parents out, casual date night, birthday, great for a group event...but romantic I would steer you elsewhere

P.S. Any highschoolers out there reading this. This a a prime Prom Night pick!"}
{"text":"It's good, but not as good as our first visit; don't you hate when that happens? This last visit versus the first one was like day and night. On our first visit we were able to sit on the patio and had a lot of privacy, it was truly relaxing, upscale and perfect. I still remember how amazing the spinach salad was!!

This most recent visit to Maggiano's could be summed up as \"ok\". We were seated rather quickly without reservations, but luckily we like to eat dinner early so that usually works to our advantage. 

Our waitress was polite and did come back often to check on us, maybe just slightly a little too often (but that's better than the reverse). 

The food was good, but most of it not over-the-top-going-to-be-caving-this-until-next-time. 

We started with the margherita flatbread which had lovely flavored toppings, I felt the crust was slightly too crispy making it a little dry at the edges. 

I did classic fettuccini alfredo and added shrimp for an extra $4 (this works out to about 6 medium shrimp) It was very good, but to me could have used a little more garlic because it was so faint. I could have done with the pasta a little firmer, but it was also by no means overlooked either. The sauce itself was perfect thickness to stick to the noodles, creamy and just enough left over for a piece of complimentary bread.

My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan, which was delicious and a generous portion of chicken (this is a $5 upgrade under Marcos meal).

Our take homes were eggplant Parmesan and the cheese ravioli. I can say on reheating the pasta it would be handy to have them more al dente for those of us who like firmer pasta. I can say that the leftovers heat amazingly, generous amounts of sauce and I actually liked the take home ravioli (the pesto in the sauce added the extra flavor kick the alfredo was lacking) better than my in restaurant fettuccini alfredo as silly as it sounds! 

For dessert we did the apple crostata with ice cream and it was amazing. The perfect crunch, buttery caramel sauce, lots of tart apples. I'm not a dessert fan but this was the highlight of the meal. 

Marco's Meal for two will run you at $43.95 and it includes the two take homes, the two pasta entrees (without protein upgrades), an appetizer and dessert. With our upgrades our total came to $52.95 before taxes and drinks. If we had ordered without the special we would have come to $57.40 WITHOUT the take home pasta and $87.90 with. Marco's meal is a fantastic deal if you're in the mood for pasta and leftovers! 

The visit could have been better with minor food tweaks, but the biggest star deduction comes from the timing of the food to arrive to the table and general atmosphere. 

I can say the kitchen was running slow. We ordered the entrees and appetizer at the same time. The appetizer took just over 20 minutes to arrive (and the restaurant wasn't even all that busy at that point), the entrees arrived 30 minutes after the appetizer. After ordering our dessert, our waitress came back 5 minutes later saying it would be out in another couple of minutes, it was 20 minutes total for that. All and all between all the waits it took about two hours from entering to leaving the restaurant.

Lastly the atmosphere to put it lightly was not relaxed as they strive for, but rather chaotic and almost stressed. Perhaps it was because we were placed in the middle of the action at one of their smaller tables center of the restaurant. The tables at the center are very close to everyone else, so you can hear all the other diners are talking about. If that wasn't enough, it seemed our table was right along a major artery for the wait staff as every other minute someone was bustling by. There is barely enough room for the wait staff to get by so it is VERY DISTRACTING! 

There was also a suited gentleman that was going from table to table asking everyone if this was their first visit, he would then present a coupon for next time for newcomers and nothing if you had already dined with them. This so distracting because I could literally hear him ask everyone one by one in the restaurant. He also seemed to get in the way of wait staff causing more congestion on the floor. He also made you feel left out if you weren't a newcomer, I can say no one ever presented me with a coupon on my first visit. Lastly, I don't know why they don't have the waitresses do this task. When the wait staff greets you they ask you if this is your first visit , it would cut down on the repeat and congestion on the floor in my opinion. 

So yes, Maggiano's is doing some things right, but there is definitely room for improvement as well. I can say that if I do return I do not want seating in the middle of the restaurant under any circumstances, it's just not enjoyable."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The three things I usually check for were all past my expectations: food, service, and restaurant interior. A couple new trainees were with my server and students of a culinary school, so they designed my cup of water with four slices of lemon just for fun. That was a nice gesture that I still remember. 
I remember I had ordered butternut squash soup and lobster ravioli. Both were so delicious, so tasty, I can still remember exactly how they looked too. I was amazed with my first bite or sip of both. There's a nice variety of taste in the ravioli because of the other little things they mix in the dish. 
Awesome place, great for groups and special events."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because I was in a larger party (under 10 ppl)  but the forgot one of the orders. They did comp that meal but if you're hungry and ready for dinner it sucks to have to wait. 

My meal came out on time and it was delicious I had the Chicken Francese. I loved it! Pretty filling and not too heavy which I appreciated since I was going to go out later that evening. I love pasta but let's face it, it's heavy.

I would definitely visit this location again, good servers and good food. Remember if the party is too large, they make you dine family style."}
{"text":"Nice place for a chain. Service could be a little better. Didn't come around to check on you. Food is good. I had the HUGE seafood pasta.. could have fed 4 on that bowl."}
{"text":"Food was bland and less then appetizing. Everyone at the table agreed. Service was fine but for $185 bucks for a bunch of pasta - no thanks. This place does not at all mirror the fashion show mall location which was always delicious. No way will my family go back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed this restaurant. We came for Sunday brunch and we were not disappointed. My wife had the Smoked Salmon & Spinach Benedict off of the brunch menu ($14.95) and she loved it. I have to tell you that I have had a difficult time finding restaurants that can prepare eggs Benedict properly.  It is especially frustrating when breakfast houses featuring this dish can't get it right. This venue operates primarily as a dinner house and they nailed it.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was on point and the entrée was served hot. I had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes (3) off of the dinner menu ($31.95) This entrée was served with a Calabrian Pepper Aioli sauce on the side and a small salad of Arugula & Tomatoes. It was a good thing that this sauce was served on the side versus over the crab cakes as I found it too hot for my palette. I would order this with the hollandaise sauce instead and add black pepper to taste. Once again, I am usually disappointed with this item in most venues that feature it. Not here. These crab cakes were very good and definitely worth a try. We decided to share a \"seasonal\" Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler for dessert.  This dessert was too sweet for my liking. In fact, not knowing better, I would have thought I was eating strawberry jam. I think a part of me was hoping for more of a tart note from the rhubarb. Overall, an excellent meal in a very nice venue.  Service was good.  However, the server was a bit too friendly.  He kept making conversation and asking us questions while we were eating our meal a little bit past the point of being comfortable. He was not rude, just overly friendly. It was awkward to say the least. In his defense, he did provide my wife with a complementary order of Vera's Lemon Cookies for her birthday, which she described as, \"Delightful, fluffy pillows of deliciousness.\"  It just doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"I am a carbivore. My favorite foods are all carbs and as a result I end up eating a lot of Italian. So naturally, I've been to Maggiano's several times.

One thing holds true every time I go to Maggiano's--I always enjoy their appetizers more than their entrees. I don't think their entrees are bad, but I also don't think they're anything special. Their appetizers on the other hand are delicious.

My personal favorites happen to be their caprese, the stuffed mushrooms and the mushroom ravioli. Being a carbivore, as I mentioned before, my favorite is of course the mushroom ravioli. Everytime I go here with someone I always order the mushroom ravioli and make my guest try it. I haven't had a single person say it was \"eh\" or \"average\". This one dish has gotten a 4/5 or above from everyone who has tried it. I even had someone who didn't like mushrooms going back for more.

I think I'll have to go there for lunch today..."}
{"text":"We did a pre fix menu because that was our only option with 11 people. Food was ok. Gnocchi w sausage was alil salty. Veal parm needed to pounded out it was way to thick for veal, chicken Marsala I was told was good but not enough chicken was given for everyone to try, some pasta dish came out but still not sure what it was maybe it had some meatball or sausage in it but it wasn't a red sauce n it was very bland. stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with only bread crumb which was ok I guess. Chef gave us a really nice bruschetta platter which was great n our Apple n brownies were great as well. I am disappointed in the fact that we were unable to order separate dinners, we are not big fans of eating off of plates that others have their hands in and being that it's cold n flu season it was just not a good idea. I manage to get my husband dinner served from the kitchen but the waiter seem annoyed n recommended that I just scoop his first. Well I refused n insisted he get his from the kitchen. Anyway it all worked out. We enjoyed the rest of the evening but will never do a pre fixed meal again."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places for a nice meal out. We have been for my college graduation and more recently to celebrate my new job that is causing me to relocate across the country. 

The service was fast, the food was excellent (we were all stealing bites off each others plates) and I LOVE that I always have enough left over for lunch the next day. I had the Gnocchi and Italian Sausage in a delicious vodka sauce, and split the toasted pound cake for dessert. (10 out of 10, would recommend).

However the best dish at our table was my mothers. The crab and shrimp cannelloni was to die for."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.... I have been there before and have had a tasty Rock shrimp lemon butter garlic pasta that was to die for. However this recent visit, I think I got an off night or just ordered the wrong things. It was all good with the exception of the items being a little dry.  Maybe more sauce was needed by chance.  Next time I'm going to speak up.  Because I like it alot and will be back."}
{"text":"So impressed!! We were here for my husbands birthday dinner, and everything was amazing.

We ordered filet mignon and the lobster carbanara. Our food came to our table HOT. (I hate when it comes to you warm or semi warm. I don't want it sitting in a window.

We also tried the calamari. It was the best we have ever had.
Our waiter Assad, was great. Our drinks always filled, and overall great service. JHe even brought my husband a small bday dessert. 

Portions are huge! Food is fresh, prices are good!


We wiill be back!!"}
{"text":"Don't believe them when they get your order wrong and say it will only take a minute to fix. \"No no I say this is fine\". Oh no we insist. Then you wait 10-12 minutes while the rest of your party eats and you wait and wait. Then the bill has both the wrong order and the replacement meal on it. So sorry we will fix this. And 15 minutes later you get the right bill. Wrong take home dinner but at that point who cares. Let me go.  Food was good I'm told. Most of my dinner is in a takeout carton in the refrigerator."}
{"text":"ate here on CHristmas eve - great food great service"}
{"text":"Bad service, food arrived 40 min later, steak was over burnt... all this is enough to give 2 stars...so disappointed"}
{"text":"We had a group dinner here last Sunday and throroughly enjoyed all the food.  As always, Maggiano's portions are huge and everyone took enough food home for the next day.  The sampling appetizers were a hit, especially the fried zuchini which were surprisingly good especially dipped in the aioli sauce.  We ordered calamari and stuffed mushrooms too which are always good at maggiano's as well.  

There was a mix up with the ravioli dishes as they were each given to the wrong guest.  No problem, as the waiter immediately brought out new, correct plates to the right person.  We had a great time and I highly recommend Maggiano's for groups.  Rest assure that there will be plenty of food and it's easy on the wallet.

My only complaint was the service because I thought our server could have been WAY more friendly.   He didn't smile too much and didn't seem to happy serving a group of 14, 9 being teenagers..  Sure, it was a table of teenagers, but it was a pretty formal dinner and we did leave a 20% tip.  Other than that, we all had a good time."}
{"text":"We love coming to this location. There is always plenty of food that is served and always enough to take home. 
Lasagna is delicious. I love the bread that is dipped in oil and balsamic as well.  Sometimes i like coming in to just get a side portion of  pasta along with a spinach salad.   I did want to try the fall gnocci but felt the price was a bit too high.  Right now they are running a special to purchase $100 gift card and receive a bonus $20 gift card.  Great deal.  Be sure to sign up for email list to get updates on latest specials and seasonal menu items from the chef."}
{"text":"Went here after shopping in the Fashion Show Mall as me and my friend both wanted Italian and I had come here before and knew that the food is pretty good. Last time I came here I had a Caesar salad which was good and is my favorite, but I decided to try the Maggiano's Salad this time. It was good, but it ended up being pretty filling, so I was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and meatballs, but luckily I took it home for later. I don't have anything negative to say about the food, and the wait time was 20 minutes which is average for dinner time in Vegas. Our server was decent...he could have refilled my water/soda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order. We sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip. I don't ever go out of my way to go to Maggiano's but the food is good and so is the staff."}
{"text":"From the outside looking in this place looks like its very fancy. When you enter you walk right into the bar and a cluster of people. To get to the host to seat you, you have to elbow your way thru the crowd of people to get there. I did not care for that I feel in a place like this you should be greeted at the door. I meet a felow Yelper Vanessa M and she made reservations a few days in advance and very glad she did. This place was packed and the wait was rediculous. Once in the dinning room I noticed it was nice but not what I expected from the outside. The dinning room is huge and has upstairs seating. The waiters are running 100 mph. there was a table upstaris  with children and they were running up and down the stairs and was very distracting. We also were seated by the door to the kitchen, which was not the best seat in the house (lots of noise and traffic from the kitchen. 

     Now for the food. The menu was big with lots of options. They have a family style menu and an ala carte entrees, salads, soups, and apps. I got the chicken and potato soup and it was delisious. My only complaint is that I wish that it was thicker it was kind of watery. The soup had small diced up veggies and lots of big chunks of chicken.  For my entree I ordered the the shrimp with angel hair pasta and a spicy red sauce. It was a very rustic chunky sauce, definitely had a kick, lots of shrimp. The sauce was good but for the amount of pasta it needed more sauce. The only problem here was I ordered the full. Because they had a family style menu I thought that the full order would be the way to go. Our waiter i think was a little upset with that fact we were not ready to order right away. This was the first time here and the first time Vannesa and I meet so we were talking for a bit and looking over the huge menu. He should have warned me of the size of this dish. Vannesa ordered the Rigatoni D so he new I was going to be eating this myself. This bowl of pasta came out and I was for sure they had the wrong table. It was huge and could serve  5 easley with leftovers. (Vanessa posted a pic) I'm curious to see the family portion.  Vannesa realy enjoyd her dish. Lots of chicken. Her favorite part of the dish was the mushrooms.  Her only complaint was the sauce was way to thin and watery. For dessert I ordered the apple frittata. This was so good and I wanted to eat it all but dam that bowl of pasta was kicking my butt. It was $7.50 for this dessert and you could share it for sure. Vannesa new she wanted the spumoni right away and she loved it. 

Overall I think this place is good but I will only give it three star for now. The food portions are rediculously huge and the prices are good. I like that you can order a half portion and full portions or even family style. (half portions ranging from $15 -$18 and full portions going for $18-$25). I feel the server we had was not the best, a little rude. He picked up my plate and took it away without asking if I was done. Its just as well cause I should have stopped eating that huge bowl of pasta but we were talking and I put my fork down for a min and he just assumed I was done. I hate when this happens. The servers need to mention the size of these dishes especially when you order the full. The decor was ok but the checkered table cloths were kind of cheap looking and not what I expected to see here. They make it look like its very fancy, white table cloth kind of restaurant from the looks of the ouside. Food good, portions huge, price reasonable, service ok. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you like your food frozen then microwaved you will love this place. I was shocked by the food. So bland. What TF?  The Caesar salad was wilted and bland. The chicken parmesaen was pre made -frozen, square cutlet topped in horrible marinara sauce. We also split the linguini in white clam sauce. Again bland as can possibly be made , no flavor at all.....(unless you are feeding ulcer patients.) I cannot recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and is fairly spacious for each table.
The wine menu is average with a fair selection of new world and old world wines. All of its pasta can be changed to angel hair or penne and etc. Its seafoods and steaks are both very well cooked with rich taste and texture. Its portions are also very generous.
Overall the dining experience was good and is also very family friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. Always consistent.  Friendly servers.  Nice atmosphere.  Fun place for happy hour.   Great people watching.  The only thing they need to fix is the AC system.  Every seat in the bar area tables always has a blowing cold draft coming from vents and ceiling fans above. Asking to have it remedied we are always told there is nothing that can be done.    I would stay longer and spend more if it didn't have a gale blowing on the back of my neck!!!! Better wear a scarf or neck gator if you go.  Sadly it's like this in the winter and the summer. I live in Scottsdale so I know this to be true."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a company party.  It was a drive, I live on the other side of town and Scottsdale on a Saturday night is no picnic to drive through.  

The occasion was a dinner hosted by my company.  We got served 3 courses, and were waited on.  The first course was all vegetarian.  The fried cheese raviolis were amazing, the salads that were severed were delicious.  The raviolis were the first items gone.  We sat in a round table with co-workers and food was served on big plates (that were heavy, we had to help each other serve).  

The second course there was no vegetarian food, and I was offered two other choices due to my question of if any of this food was prepared vegetarian style.  She went and found out  non were, and  was she offered me eggplant parmesan.  It was excellent.

The third course was dessert, tiramisu and apple crumble deserts.   
The tiramisu was amazing.  

The placed was packed and I can see why, the food and service was amazing.

I don't know price range, since the company I work for hosted it.  On their menu on the website it has prices I believe.

It is somewhere I would take my wife for dinner, but not while we live on this side of town."}
{"text":"Worth. The. Wait. Seriously.

We made a reservation for 7pm on a Sunday night and they were running behind and we would have to wait about 15-20 minutes. I'm sure my face showed HANGRY all over it. But she was still so pleasant to me as she handed me the pager. Yup, she killed me with kindness and my reflex was to smile right back at her. A very calm, cool and collected hostess - a true professional.

We waited with everyone else in the backlog.. the bar area - there was plenty of room to wait inside which was nice. People watching made time fly by.

We were called to the stand and were quickly seated. Our server who was an older gentleman with a limp quickly came over giving us water and taking our drink orders. Quick should be this gentleman's nickname. In a very loud and crowded restaurant - he adjusted the volume in his voice appropriately. Not one person had to ask him to repeat himself all night. Just wow and throughout the night he continued to impress us all. I could go on and on about him - just know the service = 10 stars easily.

Now for the food! Everything is fresh and made to order - the bread, the salads, the entrees...everything! We were told no microwaves on the premises and I believe it!

We at the bread and oil mixture (see picture) until our salads came...and while we ate the salad. The bread is hot and fresh when delivered, impossible to resist if you aren't allergic.
The chopped salad (see picture) that our server recommended was perfect. A nice blend, of fresh vegetables, chopped crispy bacon, cheese and light dressing. One of the best salads I have ever had.

The drink special - italian punch - YUM! Sooo good and refreshing. Not sticky sweet and it tasted freshly made. I savored every last drop and it is non-alcoholic.

Then my entree came. I had no idea it would be so spectacular! I wouldn't have eaten so much bread (or anything else during the day prior to coming here). The pasta was fresh, the sauce was creamy and flavor, the peas fresh (not canned) and the quality of bacon - Neuske's from Wisconsin, some of the best bacon out there and the poached egg on top. Oh man. This dish... I tried each piece of the dish first to check out the quality and the smile spread across my face. I then cracked the yolk on the poached egg and mixed it in. WOW!!! I thought egg was great in my ramen, but This dish was one of the best ways I have experienced egg incorporated. Yes, I am biased, because I love egg, but seriously. This pasta dish was amazing. The unfortunate side is that I was not able to finish it because there was so much pasta - almost felt like a bottomless bowl. But my family was able to take the leftovers home.

If I am back in the area - I will most definitely make the time to eat here.
I highly recommend if you are looking for a casual fun atmosphere with the classic Italian feel to it."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Food mediocre at these prices.  Waited 45 minutes for a glass of wine.  Shrimp Fradiavlo, terrible.  Waiter added two other tables entrees on to our bill, and could not figure out how that happened.  Had to request everything twice.  I have been to Maggiano's many times at the Fashion Show.  Last time for me!"}

{"text":"This is the worst italian restaurant ever! It looks beautiful and stylish inside,the portions are huge,its family style,the food is good,i cant complain about it,but the service is horrible.  Our server was first of all fat,sorry for my language,but she was sweating and running like she was super busy when the restaurant was actually slow. She didnt check on our table ,we had to call someone every time we needed help. The manager ,an old guy was grumpy and not polite . They need to work on their customer service and i mean the servers need to be more profession."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Our server took good care of us since we just finished our 10+ hour drive down from CT. I will definitely stop in again if back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say, I made reservations through Opentable. I made the reservations, and then was called to confirm the reservation I made. Sure, okay. They then told me I would not be seated until a majority of my party was there. Four of the five in our party were there at 1:20 for our 1:30 reservations. We were told to have a seat and wait for our table to be ready. Walking in, passing the banquet rooms, quite a few tables were open, tables in the dining room also empty, but still had not been bussed from the previous diners. We were seated at 1:50. I understand that Mothers Day may be a busy time for restaurants on the strip and in that area, but Maggiano's has been there quite some time and it shouldn't be a surprise. We finally got to order at 2:15. As we waited, the bread was plentiful, if a little raw inside, and the requested butter was hard as a rock and unable to spread. After waiting nearly 45 minutes, four of the five of us received our food. One meal had crunchy, uncooked pasta, one meal was oversalted and cold, my personal meal was in a hot plate, but the gnocchi was cold. Not warm, but cold, and the sauce wasn't keeping any heat in. The last diner in our party, heavily pregnant, after waiting since 2 o'clock when we sat, got her primavera 5-10 minutes after the rest of us, around 3:00. The food was oversalted and wasn't particularly good. We had to request the check from our waitress, and instead of bringing the check, she brought the dessert menu. We again requested the check and she said \"so no one wants dessert?\". NO we want the check. It was really a disappointing lunch/dinner for our mother/grandma-to-be and mom-to-be. Will absolutely never return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a surprise. Very classy with outdoor seating overlooking the strip. They had an option where you could get family style that feeds four. Bruschetta not quite up to our standards but stuffed mushroom were awesome. Salad was excellent. Chicken piccata very nice and eggplant parm was great!!!!  My son had the beef tips and ate them all. I had lobster carbonara. All you can eat plus desert. $$$"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open a little over two weeks. Having lived in Chicago we were never disappointed when we went to any of the unique and successful restaurants opened under the tutelage of Rich Melman. We were eager to try the second Maggianos closer to us than the one located in the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip where you could always count on great food and customer service. However we were disappointed to find out there was no similarity between the two locations. When we entered we were surprised to find the restaurant fairly deserted  during the dinner hour. We were further surprised to find servers rushing back and forth past our table with out even a glance at us. After 10 minutes of watching servers chatting and looking busy I left my seat to stop one scurrying by for the third time to get some service. Disappointment continued as the wait for our drinks and appetizers was unreasonable considering the lack of customers. Our flatbread pizza was baked so long it was like a wooden board. The final insult came when the complimentary take out pasta that all customers received during the opening week took an inordinate amount of time to receive as did our check. I realize this was their grand opening but thats when customer service and food quality count if you expect return business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service was great, we came and got seated right away, very attentive and helpful waitress/waiter. Like the atmosphere as well, as I can see the Palazzo/Venetian hotel. Ordered the shrimp and crab canneloni and it tastes amazing. I can savor every bit of crab and shrimp in it plus the cheese and special sauce that they use, so good. See you soon Little Maggiano thanks for the delicous dinner.."}
{"text":"2 hour wait! OMG -_- The food is good, but not 2 hour good.

People, without reservations that came after us, were called before we were. We had a table of 6. We were so hungry by the time they called us that we ordered a bunch of appetizers- mussels, mozzarella sticks, and calamari. The complimentary bread was okay... not my favorite type of bread. 

I thought I ordered pasta because I saw pictures on Yelp... but it wasn't on their menu. The shrimp & crab pasta on Yelp pictures are different than the menu's shrimp & crab cannelloni. It was actually good though- 3 crepes filled with cheese, crab, and shrimp. Everyone else ordered pasta carbonara and steak. Everyone liked their food so that was good. It was a great experience but the wait is killer."}

Linguini clam, veal marsala, calamari fritte, grilled salmon with asparagus spears, tomato bruschetta, spaghetti meatball, tiramisu, warm apple crostada, and complimentary vanilla cake & butter cake with birthday candles!! All very very good and beyond satisfying. We were seated at the best round table of the dining room surrounded by big glass windows to enjoy the flashing lights and energy of Las Vegas Blvd. But the dining experience tonight was made special because Julio was so attentive and patient with our large party - great customer service with a smile! 
Side note: they had prepared extra warm apple crostadas - yummy deliciousness - and gave to us to enjoy."}
{"text":"Had Sunday dinner with my. Guy & my family visiting from NY & TX. Our waiter was great and the food was tasty and cooked to perfection! Everyone enjoyed chocolate truffles afterwards!"}
{"text":"It was ok Italian food, but I've had better. The pasta was uninspiring. The family style dinner is a really good bargain, highly recommended for a group."}
{"text":"I love Maggianos. I can't get enough of the Famous Rigatoni D. & they have the best calamari. I am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the chicken parmesan. Friendly staff & usually not very crowded when I come here. & I feel like I'm in the 1940s with the music they play. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for a salad ending up loving the ambience and the atmosphere, the smells were lovely so indulged in some Lasagne and it's by far the best tasting I've had. The portions were good sizes, and very filling. Each bite was a taste sensation.

Service was outstanding and very friendly, our server was Fred he was fantastic with us and looked after our every need.

I would recommend eating here for taste, price and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited here for a friends birthday party and everything was great. We were seated fairly quickly and greeted despite it being a busy Saturday night. The waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. I've been to many Maggiano's and this one was on par with the rest. I ordered lasagna and it was consistent with what I was expecting and always great to have the ability to take a dish home with you. Parking can be a pain during busy times since this is one of the most popular malls so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, Great service, what more do you need? 

Ordered the family \"classic\" style to share between four of us. There was wayyy too much good food to share! I was stuffed before the desserts even came out! Not sure if you are allowed to bring food home or not considering the family style menu you can keep asking for more as much as you want, but our waiter was nice enough to let us take the desserts home. 

This place can be on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for: great food and great service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First class upscale Italian food fare.  Ambience is chic and a little noisy, but makes for a great dining experience none the less.  Service is first-class!  Our server Mike was awesome!  Food presentation is spectacular and delicious.  Make a reservation on weekends.  We were lucky and only had to wait for about 20 minutes in the bar.  Highly recommended and they have an awesome selection of cuisine."}
{"text":"I usually love maggianos and visit at least once a month but my lunch experience today has made me hesitant to visit again. My boyfriend and
I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work. We arrived and noticed the reservation wasn't necessary in the less than half full restaurant. Still, we were seated in a terrible table situated next to the kitchen doors and a server station and next to a large party. Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for. It was all downhill from there. Our server was pushy and unattentive. Whenever myself or my boyfriend would order any item (and we ordered a lot-cocktails, appetizer,
2 entrees and dessert) our server would suggest a more expensive item and act agitated when we politely refused. At one point she simply refused to leave the table until we ordered the dessert she suggested even though we explained that we would really prefer to order our favorite. It was ridiculous! I understand that part of a servers job is to upsell but it was taken way too far this time. The food was good as usual but took far too long to come out and we did not receive bread until after our entrees were served. I asked for a refill of my soda when the entrees were served but didnt receive it until after we got our bill and I had to ask several times. My boyfriend and I have loved Maggianos for years but there are several other restaurants in Scottsdale with better food and better service."}
{"text":"Pretty dreadful service one afternoon recently for lunch. I really hate when servers decide whether to give good service to tables on whether they think the customers will leave a good tip. Our water glasses sat empty for over a half hour while our waiter filled other tables' glasses and avoided eye contact with us. He delivered our salads and then extremely awkwardly reached over us to get the remaining place settings. I understand that might be a corporate policy but why would you set food down, ask if you can get anything else (usually a good indicator it is okay to start eating) and then reach over your guests? Wrong order of things, weird waiter. That was the last time he visited our table before we were finished, leaving our salad bowls for our enjoyment. I also had a discount that said nothing about not being valid on weekends but they would not honor it. The other staff was not super friendly either, so I did not feel that complaining would elicit a response.

This was a one star experience overall but the food is truly amazing here that I have to give them two. They also had the large lunch menu displayed outside the restaurant when they were not serving their lunch menu on weekends. What a weird day at Maggiano's."}
{"text":"Everything here is wonderful, the staff is super friendly, the management is awesome and the food is always fresh and they quality is amazing. I love coming here, it's fun, inviting and the atmosphere great. I tried the green beans with bacon for the first time and OMFG they're amazing, my only issue is that there isn't more of them or make them bigger, they're too tiny. I love the Gorgonzola & roasted pear bruschetta and the shrimp & bacon one,
Although that's not super Italian.. fried mozzarella is fantastic, try it with the lemon aioli for a different take on flavor.. 

Just go hungry and EAT EVERYTHING"}
{"text":"I agree with Joy, Maggiano's never fails. They have DELICIOUS food and the portions are HUGE.  I absolutely LOVE the Maggiano's salad... so delicious and fresh! I work at a business in South Park and Maggiano's sends us coupons every few months that are BOGO on a select lunch menu (they give you one to eat there, they give you another in a to-go box to take home!) Can't beat the deal! My favorite-the lasagna and spaghetti with meat sauce.
Also, we have had some company events at the location... we had the private room in the back with the fireplace... top notch service (they were SUPER attentive), our own bartender, and a special menu. Will we go back again? ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"Hostess was rude. Bartender was incredibly rude. We had to sit there for over an hour and she was so mean to everyone trying to order drinks and she was just a foul little troll of a woman to try and order very simple drinks from. Food was garbage and overpriced. Could not fathom why anyone enjoys paying to be mistreated but oh well. 

Would never EVER return here even if all my food was free."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon in a casual dinner place , wouldn't have thought so being an Italian specialty. Wonderful desert and wonderful place for a romantic evening out. Does get VERY busy, but staff never gets overwhelmed. Good job maggianos."}
{"text":"A wonderful evening with great Italian food! We did not have a reservation, but were seated immediately as the restaurant was not very busy. The waitress was very pleasant and told us about the specials and chefs recommendations. She served us complimentary bread with butter, balsamic and olive oil. We also received a taste Plate of the Caprese free of charge. Tomato Basil Soup was very flavorful. The Fried Zucchini with lemon aioli is the best I've ever tasted!!! We chose the Four cheese ravioli in Alfredo sauce, which very creamy. The mozzarella inside the ravioli had melted just right and took the dish to another level!! We were too full to order any dessert, but received the Lemon Cookies complimentary! They were so light and yumm! A great Italian dining experience!"}
{"text":"my first time at maggianos overall..and it did not disappoint.  had such a great window seat, where you could see wynn and people busying around down below, since the maggiano's was in the 2nd floor of the building.  
i think this particular location would be great for lunch, or anytime the sun is out because the sun shines through the big open windows.
ordered 4 big pasta dishes (to share with four other people of course, but i would be down to eat all that), have to rave about the Rigatoni'D!! the sauce...made it what it is. a pesto, white creamy sauce sooo good, i definitely recommend it to everybody.  our waiter, i forget the name, was awesome..he had this cool accent and was so nice and helpful. the calamari was OK but ..the cheesecake was pretty good."}
{"text":"Impressive impressive... This is rock solid Italian comfort food for sure.  Couples night out and we opted for the family style menu options, for a party of four you can pick three starters, four main dishes and two desserts.  We selected the mozzarella, calamari and Italian tossed salad, all three items were great and plentiful.  The fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good.  For entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes.  For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  I'm not a chocolate person so I didn't try it but the cheesecake was Devine.  We actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake.  Portions are huge enough for 5-6 really.  The bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil.  I think this will be a regular stop on future Vegas trips this was a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is located upstairs in the front outside part of the Fashion Show mall on the strip.  If your driving park on the north side of the mall in the underground parking.  This place was packed with people, yet we still got seated very quickly.  The waiter was very pleasant and helpful.  We ordered a linguine with white clam sauce (very good:), the bracciola (ok), Maggiano's Salad (yummy), and Chicken Marsala (good, but I prefer cheesecake factory's...I know, I know, don't yell at me!)  The prices were very reasonable, and the complimentary bread was oh so yummy with the olive oil and vinegar!"}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday while we were livin' it up in Vegas! A week earlier, I reserved a table for 8pm. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were invited to relax at the bar until our table was ready. 

Sure enough, bang on 8pm we were strutting through the restaurant over to our fantastic table for two with a killer view! 

We ordered a wealth of food and some delicious red wine sangria. The food was perfect (I think we did that thing again, where we stop talking for the duration of the meal, due to rapid consumption of said delicious food). Our waiter could've been around a little more, but was very friendly and responsive all other times, so it's cool. 

I'm gonna go head and call this THE place to eat when you come to the strip. The total for appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert was easily the same price that the high end restaurants charge for one person. Not to mention the lack of food those \"high end\" places bring to the table! Maggiano's is perfect for dressing up, chowing down, and hitting the clubs and casinos after!"}
{"text":"It's like every other Maggianos, but it's on the Strip  in the Fashion Show Mall which means it's BEYOND BUSY

1 piece of advice : MAKE A RESERVATION
Unless you'd like to sit at the bar but even then, it might take them forever and a day to get to you. Even though it was busy are service was efficient & fast.

Probably won't be coming back to this location since we were in Vegas just for the weekend, plus it was WAY too crowded for my liking.

On the plus: complimentary bread, & splitting meals isn't a big deal"}
{"text":"We went with reservations for our anniversary.  We were seated promptly, the wait staff was friendly and attentive, appetizers were delicious, fried zucchini and calamari, entrees were hot and tasty and large portions.  Had our take home entrees for lunch and dinner the next day.  All for forty bucks.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I like the ambiance of this place.  Its really nice to eat outside on the balcony.  They have decent wines, the food is pretty good, healthy portions and friendly staff.  i recommend this place."}
{"text":"4 of us met up for a double date lunch and had a fabulous waitor named Robert,  he was very friendly and shared our interests of traveling stories.  It was my first time at this location, our meals were delcious and temperatures were perfect when delivered to the table. Portion sizes were appropriate as well. I look forward to trying another Maggiano's soon! Thank for a great experience."}
{"text":"Long line so I expected something spectacular. It was just average Italian food with a high price."}
{"text":"Another amazing meal at Maggiano's!  Thank you to Tracy for her great service and attention to our meal. Eggplant Parmesan is the best!  What a deal, but 1 pasta/entree, take one home for only $12.95!!!  Love Maggiano's since living in Chicago years ago. Go enjoy the food and great service. If you've not tried Maggiano's family style entrees, you need to make a reservation and go now...!"}
{"text":"We went for our first time for dinner with another couple. We had reservations, but still had to wait a short time. It was a very busy Friday. Our table was ok, but near a busy path to the kitchen and private party room. I thought with a reservation we would get a better table.
The food was very good. We all had pasta dishes and their promotion of getting a great pasta to go with your order makes this a special place. 
We would return to try some of their different sauces and dishes. 
A nice dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Today I went to walk around South Park Mall with my husband and stepdaughter and was delightfully surprised by my husband to eat lunch at Maggiano's!!! I've been here before for special events, but today was nice being on a whim. We say upstairs overlooking the dining area! The staff was extremely helpful and kind with our table. We ordered Marco's Meal for Two which included either 2 side salads of our choice or an appetizer, 2 pasta entrees and dessert. It also included a \"take home\" pastas for each of us! We chose 2 side salads, the Italian tossed salad and Chopped salad. The Italian tossed salad had a creamy Italian dressing, lettuce, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini peppers, onions and Parmesan cheese. Delightful! The Chopped salad had prosciutto, tomatoes, avocado and blue cheese with house dressing. For entrees, we chose Mom's Lasagna which had layers of pasta, cheese and meat sauce. It was filling and comforting just like from home! I chose the Eggplant Parmesan which was layers of breaded eggplant, marinara sauce and pasta. It was fresh, perfectly cooked and absolutely the best eggplant I've had in years! For dessert my husband chose the Creme Brûlée and loved it. I added an extra dessert because I wanted Tiramisu. It was huge, but the espresso-soaked ladyfingers were perfectly layered in the mascarpone cheese filling and topped with cocoa powder and dark chocolate pieces! I was stuffed but ate it all! My husband chose the lasagna to bring home and I chose the 4 Cheese ravioli. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was a major disappointment!  Bruschetta, Caesar salad, and the water were the best parts of the meal.  The stuffed mushrooms has no flavor, full of oil and too salty. The chicken cutlets were dry, salty, and had a funky taste, not eatable . The lasagna was too salty.  We ere not impressed, especially for a restaurant reported as the best Italian food in Las Vegas. This was not worth $47 each!"}
{"text":"Park in valet behind it take elevator straight up to the restaurant. BEST fried zucchini and lemon aioli anywhere ( this is truly why I come here !!) ."}
{"text":"My brother and I had my mom's 75th birthday celebration at Maggiano's Little Italy on the strip and it was fantastic! We celebrated in the beautiful Calabria Room (which was one their private dining rooms) which had a great view of the strip, a great patio area and our own bartender. We were also able to play our own music in the room which was a huge plus. My guests absolutely loved the room and they didn't want the night to end. We were able to decorate the room with our own decorations and it looked fabulous. My brother and I selected our food items from Maggiano's private dining menu and the food was fantastic, as well as the service we received from the staff at Maggiano's. Everyone gave exceptional service, from the banquet managers (Angela and Sabrina) to all the wait staff (Bob,Antonia,Michael and Fabiola) all of whom went above and beyond our expectations to make sure we had a wonderful celebration!

Maggiano's Little Italy comes highly recommend to family and friends or anyone who wants to have a wonderful private dining experience, in a stunningly beautiful room with great views, great food and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I was invited by two beautiful ladies for lunch so I picked out Maggiano's. I even made a reservation using Yelp!   

I arrived on time and ODM asked me if he could help so I asked if anyone arrived for my reservation, he checked and said Nope. So I waited seven minutes and I received a call where I found out they even started on appetizers without me with glass of wine LOL
Anyways, so I been seated for fifteen minutes and our server didn't came to see if I wanted anything to drink? so I had to call her and she brought me my coke. Through out our time at the table, she didn't stop by single time to check and see if we were out of our drink(s). 

We called her again since we were ready to order. I ordered eggplant Parmesan and come to find out, they were giving one more entree free to take home as they call it their Chef special. Food was excellent, we all enjoyed it however we didn't really like their service."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. If you have any food allergies the chef will come to your table to find the correct choice based on your needs. I would recommend them for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Me and my friends LOVE this new location. Amazing, Its far way from the strip,easily accessible, quiet yet still busy even on week nights and has better and faster service. Food eas flavorful. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Heard this location is under new management and is experiencing some issues. My last visit was last October, so this review will be based on that experience. 

Maggiano's is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Why? Because it's great food, healthy portions, and outstanding value for what you get. I always leave satisfied and the service has always been wonderful. Visited the Santa Ana, CA, Chevy Chase, MD, and Tyson's Corner, VA locations - all the BOMB! 

My favorites: 

Rigatoni 'D' 
Chicken Parmesan - I order this with a side of pasta and meat sauce since the chicken parm does not come with it 
Apple Crostada 
Peach Bellini - Now you know I have to have a cocktail with dinner! 

I've also sampled the spaghetti which is also pretty good. Honestly, I've had better though. 

Maggiano's is one of the last locations on the strip that offers a classy upscale atmosphere without the pretentiousness and is extremely affordable and family friendly.

I highly recommend Maggiano's."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is quite nice, very low lighting. It seems great for big family events, with a number of big private rooms. It's great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered to go but had a glass of wine while I waited for my food to finish. The servers seemed really nice for the most part, although I didn't get the full service since I was ordering to go. 

I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo (lighter version) with a side casear salad. The food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling. The salad was OK. Nothing too extravagant. The pasta was a nice portion, perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal. Also, they were very generous with the shrimp. Sadly, some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked. I wasn't sure but the next morning when I was sick it was confirmed! Definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here!"}
{"text":"Wow...the food was GREAT.  

The atmosphere was decent.

Our server....well she talked to much and told us about what bad customers were at the table right next to us.  While they were sitting there.

The prices...a bit high..but the quality was excellent so I was ok with it.

My take...it is worth the visit.  Would I rush back...no."}
{"text":"service here is GREAT! came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. we got hooked up with a nice table right by the window with an awesome view of the strip. our waiter was on it, always coming by asking if we had questions about the menu. he brought out our drinks right away. he was even nice enough to bring out small bowls of salad without any meat in them because one of our friends didn't eat meat. so considerate! we had a party of 8 so we decided to order family style...2 appetizers, 2 salads, 2 entrees with unlimited refills on all food. BEST. IDEA. EVER. we got a taste of everything and there was more than enough food to go around. i love this place! =)"}
{"text":"Just called to ask about their parking situation - parking lot or valet.  Person who answered said that they did have both.   I asked how much valet was or if it was free.  She didn't know.  Come on, teach these people how to better answer the phones!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The service is superior and the food is excellent.  This place is a great place to bring someone for lunch and the food is beyond compare."}
{"text":"Someone please pinch me & say it isn't so! 

Dinner was wonderful and the service was great, or so I thought, until after I got home... 

I picked up the tab that night and no sooner than I totaled & signed the slip, my friends were somewhat rushed to leave. I left my signed copy at the table, grabbed my bag of leftovers and off we went. After I got home, I got to thinking, \"The waiter never gave me my credit card back!\" Oh and it gets better... My boyfriend goes to open my leftovers to take a peek and it was someone else's food- GROSS! 

I called the restaurant yesterday morning and thankfully, they confirmed they did have my card. I wasn't able to make it out there yesterday mind you, it's a 35 mile drive one way- Here I am now, after getting my card back from them... I walked inside and politely asked to see a manager, as not only wanting to get my card back, but also wanted to let her know about sending me home with someone else's leftovers, rather than mine. 

She arrives at the hostess station and asks how she can help - I showed her my ID, asked for my card and then also explained to her about the mistake with the food... With NO apology, she abruptly asked what food it was I had that night. I told her it was the fettuccine alfredo and she said okay, she would be right back. Well, here she comes, with a to-go-bag of fettuccine in one hand and my card in the other. She said, \"here you go and thanks for coming.\" I was so floored, I looked at her and explained I just drove 35 miles to come pick up my credit card, it was lunchtime, I hadn't eaten lunch yet and I was pretty hungry. I asked her if I could have a plastic fork so I can eat it in my car. She then replied, \"Sure, would you like a couple napkins too?\" 

OMG, WOW!!!! How about asking the customer if they could seat you and buy you lunch? She didn't even get it when I asked her for a plastic fork. I was polite, but it was indeed sarcastic and she never got it. She was only focused on getting me out of there as quickly as possible and there wasn't even a huge lunch rush at this hour. 

This is so absolutely ridiculous, it's hysterical! I'm thankful I'm laughing at all of this, however, corporate needs to know about it. COMPLETELY unprofessional and without a doubt, unacceptable. 

 I sent corporate a message through Facebook. They responded by telling me someone would write back to me as soon as they could. Wow.
... and I'm still waiting... this was on Tuesday.

Are the servers organized & attentive? No.
Are mangers with common sense hired by Maggiano's? No.
Does Maggiano's expect their managers to be professional & courteous? Apparently not.

Will I go back to Maggianos? Not a chance."}
{"text":"Some places wow you with their style and exotic cuisine, others sneak up on you with a little more subtlety. Maggiano's was one of my favorite meals in Las Vegas, because they just made everything easy. First of all, being in a non-smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. We got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants. 

It is a chain, but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees, Chicken Pesto Linguine and Chicken Francese ($11 - 13), were excellent. One of my favorite things to eat in Italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil, but it is hard to find in the U.S. I was thrilled when it came as a side to the Chicken Francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories. 

From our arrival through the end of service, the staff was professional, prompt and courteous. Portion size was hearty, especially the pasta dish, so we even skipped dinner that night. Not the most exciting choice in town, but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air, sweet, sweet fresh air."}
{"text":"We came here 4th of July after the fireworks. Our server was really nice and patient though it was already late and they were gonna close soon. He also gave suggestions on what is good and it really was an amazing experience. The food was amazing too! I had the lobster carbonara and i was really happy with my order."}
{"text":"The food here is always plentiful, tasty, and the service always sublime. If I had to pick a chain of Italian, it's definitely Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Maggiano's while in Vegas for my Daughter's Birthday and we all had a fantastic time.  We are putting this restaurant on our list of places to eat every trip to Las Vegas.

Maggiano's is located at the Northern tip of the Fashion Show Mall, directly across from The Wynn, on the 2nd Floor.

The decor and atmosphere is reminiscent of New York City Italian restaurants.  The Italian speaking host was super friendly and very courteous.  Our waiter Nick was fantastic.  Very friendly, very personable, and super attentive.  All of the staff were fantastic.  We also got to meet the Executive Chef Frank Zmuda who came by our table to wish my Daughter a happy birthday, which was awesome!

All of our dishes were incredible tasting.  Everything is made from scratch, so if there is something you don't want in your dish or are allergic to an item, it's no problem for them to make it your way.  The menu also has traditional dishes but made with less calories.  We ordered the lighter side chicken parmesan, and  fettuccine alfredo, the portion size was huge, the taste was delicious, but about half the calories were missing.  Great taste and less calories, what a deal!

The portion size on all of the food was very generous.  My son ordered a flat bread pizza from the kids menu, and it was so large he could not finish it.

We were there for happy hour and ordered some of the $6 happy hour margaritas, which were better than we have had at most Mexican restaurants on the strip.  They were delicious, and you could tell they were generous pours of tequila.  I had to order a second round of margaritas they were so good.

Because it was my Daughter's Birthday they brought over a plate with cookies and truffles and \"Happy Birthday\" was written on they plate in chocolate.  We also shared the banana split cheese cake, which again probably some of the best cheesecake we have ever had.

The prices were extremely reasonable, especially for Vegas.  I would have paid twice as much for our dinner at any of the hotel Italian restaurants, and the food would not have been nearly as good.

They also have children's cooking classes at different times throughout the year, something my kids were very interested in.

I want to Thank Maggiano's, Chef Frank, and our Waiter Nick, for so making my Daughter's Birthday Dinner so special.

We are looking forward to eating here again on our next Vegas trip.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to our family and friends."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is wonderful. I had lasagna and it was pretty tasty, lots of sauce. Best to make a reservation if coming on a weekend day. I've always liked this place and will continue to return."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to leave the fur kids with a sitter and have an impromptu date night. Ok so no sitter but we did in fact have a wonderful date night at Maggianos! 
I had the frozen Bellini with a swirl for my drink and man was it good. Super creamy, smooth, and delish! 
I started with the Chopped Salad which was out of this world good. Fresh and crisp to start but it was slightly over dressed so by the last few bites it was a bit soggy. That certainly didn't stop me from finishing it though...sigh.
For my meal I had the Chef's Pasta Special. It was shell pasta, with shiitake mushrooms, carmalized onions, sausage, cheesy cream sauce and dried tomatoes. It was seriously out of this world good. I can honestly say one of, if not, the best, pasta dishes I've had in a long time. I had to control myself and make sure to eat it one bite at a time, fully chew and swallow before taking another bite. I also forced myself to bring half of it home for left overs. If you order this pasta, get the Bellini, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they paired together. I did it by accident but think they should recommend the two as a pairing. My husband had the Chicken Parm and said it too was great and some of the best he's had. Service was a bit slow, (took over 15 minutes to get our drinks) but his personality was on point and we could tell he was very passionate about his job which in turn made our dinner even that much more enjoyable. We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Bottom line: great food, but outrageously priced, and a poor atmosphere to dine.  The food is absolutely fantastic.  The menu has a massive selection of dishes to choose from, including vegetarian choices.  My favorite dessert that I have enjoyed for over a decade is the chocolate zucotto cake.  Service is usually excellent.  My only complaints are the outrageous prices on everything, but especially pasta dishes.  Also, there are too many tables crammed into the space so everyone is sitting on top of each other.  In my opinion, there is nothing special or romantic about that kind of atmosphere.  With so many people, it tends to get far too noisy."}
{"text":"I looooove this place! Amazing food, Perfect spot @ d strip and of course a good way to start your evening with their full bar while you wait for your table. I always leave this place with a very big smile on my face ( literally ear to ear ) because of their superb tasting food and full bar."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the services and food \" Our waitress was very kind and attentive \"Definitely will be coming back when where in town"}
{"text":"There's really no where else to go for Italian in town. The location and ambience is awesome. But what I love is their scratch kitchen. This isn't an out of the can, processed food place. Everything is made to order. Best appetizer, zucchini frittes. Oh my.
They are very accommodating and creative for my gluten free friends.
Amazing salads and pasta...and the desserts, to die!!
If you haven't been,  what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Fuggedabout it. Impossible service. Seated brunch at 11 am. Private room. 4 tables of 10, scheduled weeks in advance. Muffins arrived at 11:30. No drinks. Pause. Potatoes and bacon arrived at 11:55. Pause. We ate that fraction of the meal COLD because we were hungry.  Questioningly. Asking for service. At 12:20 eggs and French toast, but no one was hungry at that point. At 12:30 first round of drinks and coffee. The tables are a mess. Top plates were never removed so they were used for the meal. 12:30 and we are done with the meal, no regrets about leaving. An hour and a half for this? Oh, wait now they are bringing fruit? Update: Spoke with general manager who said he will follow up with banquet service team."}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's last night.  I'm a vegan, and I asked the waiter what he suggested for a vegan.  The waiter promptly got Chef Doug (executive chef) to come out and chat with us.  We explained that we were vegan and were up for eating anything, to just surprise us.  The meal that came out, was tremendous!  We got two different dishes to give a bit of variety and both pastas were excellent!  Thanks so much Chef Doug and Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"My bartending staff was amazing. Gina and I believe Catherine was the other lady where so busy but never neglected me being a single dinner. The bar was full and really busy. But they always made me feel I was important. The food selection was great from there recommendations and the dessert was to die for. My God."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this restaurant a higher rating than what other Yelp guest are suggesting, however the service was lacking and the food wasn't the best.  Here are a few examples:

A) Drinks - I ordered a red Sangria and although it came out as a somewhat Sangria, it was overly full of a lot of carbonation.  It was almost too disgusting to drink.  How can you mess up Sangria in an Italian restaurant?

B) Meatballs - Ordered this as an appetizer and it was full of garlic...wayyyy too much.  I suffered from major heartburn from this later.

C) Salads - Only have one dressing and wouldn't take other request or have other dressings.

D) Lasagna - Too much oil and grease, also contributed to the heartburn.  Also contained too many onions.

Overall, I don't think I will be back.  I'll stick to Olive Garden or a place that can serve true Italian food.  Was not happy about the service nor the food.  Waited a long time in the bar area for someone to take my order.  See attached picture!"}
{"text":"Ate here for my birthday dinner and was very impressed with the food. The food earned 5 stars but I have gave them 3 stars due to the service. We requested a window table and we were on time for our reservation and still got shafted! They has a perfectly good window table that has adequate seating for our party of 6 and they told us they generally don't sit 6 at that table which made no sense smh. Then out waiter disappeared for like 30 minutes and when I asked the manager to tell him we needed something she acted as if we were bothering her which was rude. Aside from the lack of service we received the food was delicious and fresh. I ordered the shrimp and chicken Ziti and was satisfied. If you want good food and mediocre service this is the place!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before!??? I absolutely love Italian food, like love! Decided to try out this place last minute and so glad I did.  Went during lunch time and had some drinks, appetizers,  and pasta! Yummy. 
First off, the restaurant is gorgeous and huge. They have a few rooms that can accommodate large parties.   Love the fact that they have a specific menu where all proceeds go to the make a wish foundation. Love the view of the strip from the restaurant. Had the lasagna and I thought it was delish!! My husband had to be difficult so he had them make him a specific  pasta that wasn't on the menu and they did so without hesitation.  The waitress was awesome and suprisingly didn't seem frustrated by my husbands need to be picky! Lol. Enjoyed everything about our experience!"}
{"text":"This place has certainly changed alot, they use to have the best caesar salad and on our visit this past saturday, not so good, barely had any dressing on it.  Service was also very poor, I understand they are very very busy but we waited a very long time to get our bread.  Our waiter had not help from his busser.

I don't like how you can no longer order small and large, food quality has definately gone down. :("}
{"text":"Good italian in Vegas. Easy to go with kids, We went with our daughters and they enjoyed the lasagna and spaghetti. Dishes quantities are big."}
{"text":"In the past this has been an outstanding restaurant with excellent cousine but over the past couple of years they have struggled with maintaing an acceptable sanitation grade. Hoping that maybe management had cleaned up their act we took a chance and made Thanksgiving Day reservations.
 I always make it a practice to look for the sanitation grade before dining anywhere. Upon arrival I quickly noticed the glaring \"90\" grade. Just one point away from being a GRADE \"B\" restaurant! 
Totally Unacceptable! We immediately left the restaurant and luckily found an open slot at nearby Ruth's Chris.
This is clearly a management failure,. There is no excuse for poor sanitation particularly when charging first class prices. 
What a shame, because in the past Maggiano's had a reputation for being a supurb restaurant with amazing Italian cousine. 
Hard to enjoy that superb food when you're wondering what's going on (or not) in the preparation of your food."}
{"text":"Absolute best Italian food I have ever had!  The wait staff great!  I would go a million times more!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here last night because my girlfriend had a gift card that she received from work, and the food and service was excellent.

We started with salads; I had the Italian tossed salad which was exactly the way it was described on the menu. The vegetables were fresh and crispy. My girlfriend had the Caesar; she ate all of it. 

We then had the mussels with the spicy sauce. It was a little spicier than the server claimed, but we like spicy. Obviously the salad was supposed to come out first, but our server had the smarts to bring the salads first because the mussels take longer. The mussels were good, but the sauce was boss.

For entrees, I had the braised brisket cannelloni and my girlfriend had the chicken Parmesan. The cannelloni is one of the best pasta dishes I've had. The chicken Parmesan had a very nice and crispy breading with juicy meat inside. I like my chicken Parmesan with more sauce and cheese, but it was my girlfriend's dish and she loved it the way it was.

Our server's name was Jorge and he provided some of the best service ever! Great dinner, great service, with a great girl. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had been waiting and two girls walk in and because they are dressed sluty the manager goes behind us and tells the hostess to sit them fisrt. Kind of crappy in my book. Decided to leave. Waste of my time"}
{"text":"It was such an amazing meal for me and my friends, they only reason I give it 4 stars is because we where seated in such a small table... Our plates didn't really fit . otherwise food was amazing"}
{"text":"A fairly good Italian spot in the mall. Food is good with large portions. The 'Take a Pasta Home' gimmick makes it feel like an Olive Garden, but that's a great marketing ploy. Little cramped,"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure going to such a vibrant and extremely tasty Italian restaurant. The weekends get rather busy and the people and noise levels rise but that doesn't stop the dinner plans for two if reservations are made."}
{"text":"Walked in went to the right and was greeted by smiles. The room was brightly decorated room full of lovely Christmas designs hung above my head.  Tables are well organized, so walking to our table waa smooth.. Two level dinning option. Staff was very attentive and polite. Food came out perfect. I used their buddy dinning option for 2. I had the lasagna here & eggplant to go. :) calamari came out perfect, tiramisu was very rich I could only eat two scoops. Haha. Id go again and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but it did have room for improvement. But then again this place is a chain. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to come with the family.  You can't beat the deal on Marco's meals.  My husband and I were here with his parents and mother's cousins the other night.  The place was very busy but our waiter Jeff kept all the drinks well stocked and we never had to ask for refills.  All of our meals were prepared perfectly.  The portions are huge and we had plenty for left overs.  Try the Creme Brulee - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Took a break from shopping to enjoy some vino here the other day.  It was 2:30pm and let me tell you, it was packed!  That's a sign they are doing something right.  This is another chain restaurant but still delivers as if it was a one off style place.  I've eaten here a few times and each time the dishes are plentiful, as Italian dishes should be.  The service is always good and attentive as well the atmosphere is overall casual and essentially very relaxing to me.  I like a good family style place to eat and Maggiano's accomodates this quite nicely :)"}
{"text":"5 stars for service, food quality and my overall experience. Some of the best family style offered Italian food I've had a chance to experience in Las Vegas so far. General manager Luigi DiGrande is very attentive and willing to answer any questions you may have."}
{"text":"Called to make reservations for a party of 7, Hostess on the phone said they were booked and pretty busy however we can walk in and wait... 

On the way down I was able to make Reservation via Internet, however we still thought the Restaurant would have at least an hour wait for a \"BUSY\" Saturday night as the Hostess stated.... come to our surprise Restaurant was far from Busy, and we were sat almost instantly. 

Very pleased with the Food, Great sized Portions, Complimentary bread oil and vinegar, however being lied too over the phone was rude, and almost made us change our dinner plans for the evening...."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good, but not exorbitantly priced Italian dinner on the strip after the Cirque du Soleil show at Treasure Island and Maggiano's (open until 11) did not disappoint.  The food was excellent, the quantities generous, the atmosphere upscale but not formal, and the service both courteous and efficient.  The three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections: chicken, spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me, eggplant parmesan with gluten free pasta for Norm, and I believe \"traditional home-style lasagna for Dennis, a favorite of the Philly native.
 
Our meals were preceded by warm, soft and delicious house-baked bread accompanied with olive oil, which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions, which again, did not disappoint in either quality or quantity. 

My manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich Asiago cream sauce, a 4-Lactaid event of potential dairy disaster, especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers, but all settled just fine and I don't regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining Asiago sauce after the entrée was gone.  My meal came in at a very reasonable (especially for  the Strip) $18.50 plus $6.50 spinach side salad with pine nuts, a not-overpowering smattering of red onion, applewood smoked bacon, a white balsamic vinaigrette, and blue cheese,  I loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta, and the salad did not suffer for its removal. Regrettably there was no room for dessert. 

Service was polite, efficient, and more than reasonably attentive.  My iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long.  Our total for 3, including wine, beer, and my tea and side salad came in at I believe under $100, which we agreed was very reasonable given the location, quality, quantity, service, atmosphere and ambiance.  

We were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants, and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in Phoenix, over in Scottsdale.  Given distances (and our budgets!), Maggiano's won't be a regular dining destination for us, but it will be a special one.  If all locations are as good as this one, we collectively highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food!  Glorious food!  You're going to stuff your face at Maggiano's. 

We dined at this location for a team luncheon. It's not quite beneficial to have a family-style feast of carbs, sauces, cheese and meats if you wish to be productive during the latter half of the day...But it was SO worth it!
Appetizer:  stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, and the tomato caprese. These dishes are on the oily side (in this case, oil=flavor), and it's way too easy to have one (or four) too many servings. 

First course:  spinach salad, caesar salad and freshly baked bread. The salads were fresh, generously dressed and highly addictive. 

Second course:  fettuccine alfredo, homestyle lasagna, chicken piccata, baked ziti, and chicken Parmesan. All of these dishes are on the heavier side, but were absolutely delicious. A little bit goes a long way!

Dessert:  chocolate zoccatto cake and apple crustada with caramel sauce served a la mode.  Who doesn't love chocolate cake or apple pie?   I could eat the apple thing alllll day long. 

Is there such thing as too much deliciousness in one meal?"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but this is the exception. Started off with the Italian sausage and peppers - mind was blown from there. This place is phenomenal, looks beautiful, and serves tasty food. If you are like me and skeptical about chain restaurants, give this place a try and I swear they'll change your mind!"}
{"text":"We held our wedding ceremony and reception for 90 people in the banquet rooms at the restaurant.  The experience was virtually seamless and beyond our expectations.  The response time and efficiency of the process was impressive.  Our questions and concerns were addressed at every turn.  We chose the restaurant based on pictures and the menu we found on line. My husband decided to take an earlier trip to \"taste test the food and see the space\"... as well as golf.  He came back raving about the food and assured me that I would love the venue.  

The first time I stepped foot into Maggiano's was on the way to the alter and I can say, it blew me away.  The atmosphere is so beautiful and romantic.  The food and service was absolutely amazing. The menu options are by far the best value money can buy in Vegas.  You definitely will not go away hungry.  We still get compliments from my guests and we can guarantee they will all be eating at Maggiano's on their next visit to Vegas!

If you are considering Maggiano's Little Italy as your venue of choice, you won't go wrong!  We do, without hesitation, recommend to everyone we talk to, to have a meal at Maggiano's.  It is perfect for parties of all sizes and you will definitely impress your guests.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! For everything!

Sheri & Bill"}
{"text":"Again, this place will get five stars from me.  I'm just going to keep this one simple.  Great food, great service, and a spectacular view overlooking the Las Vegas strip.  We had dinner here a few weeks ago and despite the hustle and bustle inside, the atmosphere was great.  They even have a singing maitre d.  Overall, we had an amazing time and went home with full and happy belly's."}
{"text":"We read comments from yelp before going to dinner. I had lasagna which was good. My husband had chicken parmasean with side of spaghetti. His spaghetti was cold and asked for it to be rewarmed. We asked 3 more times and he informed us that he was waiting on the kitchen. After 20 min they showed up with spaghetti. Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"This food was very good the bread they give is yummy don't eat to much of it you'll get full. The fettuccine Alfredo was good the chicken was very tender except i seen a picture here on yelp and my Alfredo had no broccoli,  my boyfriend had the chicken saltimbocca which he said was really good all together it was wonderful good services and not to expensive"}
{"text":"I just hosted a wedding at Maggianos this past weekend for 70 guests in a private room. Overall, my guests repeatedly said the food was delicious, and that they had a great time. We opted for a dinner service that included passed appetizers, two salads, two pastas, two entrees, a dessert table and an open bar for 4 hours. The guests said they were stuffed, and they really enjoyed the open bar. The staff was attentive and did an excellent job. They even ordered in a special alcohol at the request of my husband. The meal and bar package was amazingly priced and when you add in a beautiiful view of the strip it made for a memorable night. Thank you for taking such good care of our guests! I highly recommend them for large parties!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, this location has $5 Coppola wines on Tuesday nights. A welcome relief from the $18.oo  9oz pours in their regular wine offering list.

It wasn't busy at the bar, the service was excellent, and the food was perfectly cooked. Ordered Chicken Parm and substituted Fettuccine Alfredo for the regular spaghetti (no charge for this!)

Overall, it is a really nice restaurant and very well run."}
{"text":"Friendly service. and a great view of the Encore, Wynn, and Palazzo! Will definitely return. :)"}
{"text":"Cant say how much I love maggianos. The servers here are always the friendliest people and so helpful with pictures!!! Coming here on my Vegas trips have become a tradition. It's walking distance from the Wynn and trump tower so it's very convenient since driving on the strip is such a hassle. The food is not the healthiest but will hold u up during the night. I would NOT recommend getting their salad though because it's like the salad out of a dollar bag from the store and very plain."}
{"text":"Food was excellent , waitress couldn't sweeter, and they gave us free desert for our anniversary!! Ellen was out amazing server"}
{"text":"Beat restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas ! The service is awesome .will definitely be coming back ! Food is so delicious! I give it 5 stars ! awesome place."}
{"text":"I went with Maggiano's solely on the reviews of fellow Yelpers and brides everywhere online. I'd never eaten here prior, but I'm a little risk taker, and figured that hundreds of honest reviews cannot be wrong. I was SO RIGHT!!  We had our reception in the DiCarlo room on 3/28/16. Small crowd (26 ppl) and a dance floor w/a DJ. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. 

The Decor = Old world Italian (think 1950s, which went GREAT with my wedding theme of tea length dresses and fedoras). 

The Service = Our waitstaff was very attentive, and very friendly. Our server kept making sure that we were all full with food and drinks in hand.

The Food = OMG. This was some of the BEST  I'd ever had. It was Family Style. We decided to go with the Milano Package (which included 4 HOUR open bar of premium liquor, and various wine, appetizers, salads, pasta, main course, and desert). We had SO MUCH FOOD that we ended up leaving with 5 trays of \"to go\" items that we just ate for dinner last night. Thank God we had a DJ to work off the food. 

The Nitty Gritty =  I'm not sure if this goes for ALL the rooms, but to book a room (DiCarlo) there is a minimum of $1200 that needs to be spent (If your food package is less than that amount, you can always use DJ svs, cakes, decorations etc...as part of the minimum if booked through Maggiano's which is AWESOME). They do charge a 20% event Fee (before tax) for the private room used. Additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event.

HIGHLY recommended. For someone like myself who is a total control freak, these amazing Coordinators @ Maggiano's took care of everything that was required to make this day memorable. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. I can make better pasta at home. Also, the service was terrible. We waited over an hour for our food, past dinner primetime (we arrived at 8:15 and the food did not arrive until 9:30). I asked two waiters for a takeout box for my dessert and waited 20 minutes before I left without a takeout box. It is also too dark inside."}
{"text":"It is kind to call this restaurant marginally mediocre. It is 1 small step above a tourist trap. Why? Let me count some of the ways. No wine list on being seated. Feeling of perpetual movement and panic. Our server was more than adequate but I'll bet he was the best. Food is really nothing. Everything is drowned in a sauce of some kind. Cheese on the table in a jar, so I ask for fresh cheese and get some more shredded cheese in a glass. Class is not available in this place unless it is none.  Saltimbocca is on the menu as Chicken. So, I call ahead to get a veal Saltimbocca. They have no idea what a Saltimbocca is. Sounds more like a Veal Marsala.that they serve.. I ordered a baked Ziti, figured what could they do to pasta. Well, the Ziti was not baked. Just regular Ziti drowned in something. Edible but not what I go out for. I do wish restaurants and others would stop putting names on menus that have no relationship to what they serve. I also wish the public had more respect for itself and did not rave about bad restaurants like this one. Well, at least it's terribly overpriced so I knew I was in Vegas."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is 4 stars, the service was fast & friendly but I knocked it down to 3 stars because of the atmosphere. We went in planning on having a romantic dinner for our anniversary and instead it's like we walked into a big family dinner party. And it maybe fun for some I found it a bit overwhelming. Soon as we walked in we had to walk through the dining room maze and to the middle of the crowded restaurant which is expected at 630pm Saturday night. But it was the layout that just crams everyone together. Unless you're in a booth it's pretty much like you're eating with the other tables next to you. It was so loud that I had to shout over to have a conversation with my hubby. It wasn't loud music it was just having so many people in one room talking, even the guy who serenaded us with a guitar I could barely hear and he was right in front of me.
   As for the food, awesome! I got the lobster carbonara and it was delish. Lots of lobster, cream sauce was tasty and huge portion, only complaint is a little too much Parmesan cheese that it kinda hides the flavor of the sweet lobster. Hubby had chicken Alfredo and loved it but couldn't finish it (rarely happens). Got the sampler for dessert and it's must if you can't decide on one thing. 
  Overall not a bad place for good Italian food with family & friends but definitely don't recommend for romantic dates."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The bread they brought to the table was ok, but the salad and the lasagna I ordered were both good and the mini cheesecake at the end was sooo yummy!

My boss, who is um, particular, didn't have such a good experience as his pasta was over done, but the waiter was nice and replaced it for him. I'm a pretty laid back diner so I kinda felt bad when my boss corrected him, etc but he handled it well.

They were great about refilling my water a ton of times. I'm on dr. orders to drink over a gallon a day so he helped me along:)"}
{"text":"My family had a special dinner her last night. The place was gorgeous. We had never been here before.  The service was first class. Very attentive and friendly staff. 
We explained my wife's food allergy and the chef came out to explain what they can do for my wife, who has celiac disease. So we thought, wow. This is amazing. Different versions of gluten free pasta? She can't wait! So we order the mussels as an appetizer and that was where this beautiful train flew off of the tracks. They assured us of the care they took in preparing the meal as to not contaminate my wife food. But the very first thing she ate, she got sick from. We finished our meal, which the others all loved and headed home. My wife's stomach was swollen by the time we got to Belk. we arrived home she was in agony and that went on all night. So the meal would have been perfect was if not for my wife getting contaminated. Celiacs beware of the mussels. 
  Order certain items and you get a similar item to take home. Great deal."}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of Italian but the chicken parmesan here is so amazing and mouth watering. The chicken is so tender and the food has so much flavor!"}
{"text":"I have been to Maggianos about 3 different times but this last time warrants some shout outs. I graduated and wanted a place to go for my group of 10 friends and family. I found out they also have a happy hour that's offered in the restaurant so I made the reservation. 

We were seated right away and our drink orders were taken almost immediately. The group decided to participate in the family style dinner. We had calamari, bruschetta, chopped salad, chicken parm, fettuccine Alfredo, Parmesan crusted tilapia, tiramisu and pound cake. WOOOO! 

The best part of our meal was the very attentive and funny Jacob. He always offered us more food but everything was just enough for our group. He kept the drinks a flowing too and made sure this girl was happy, happy on her graduation day."}
{"text":"I drive by Downtown Summerlin every morning on the way to the gym and watched as Maggiano's was being done on the inside.  I had never been to the Fashion Show Mall location so this was a new restaurant for me.  I received a coupon in the mail and decided to use it.

I was seated at a booth.  They have no two top tables so I opted for the four person booth.  It was early so I wasn't taking room away from people waiting.  Very quickly, my server, Drew, came by, introduced himself and asked about beverages.  After asking for iced tea, he brought me two glasses just in case I needed a refill and he wasn't readily available.

I was then brought some bread and he poured some olive oil onto a serving plate but I stopped before he added any balsamic because I'm not a fan of oil and balsamic with bread.  Instead, I added a little salt and the oil was ready for the bread.

The veal marsala was brought and it was a good sized portion of the hearty dish.  The sauce was a little strong but not overpowering.  Drew checked back a few times to see how things were going and I took my time to enjoy the veal.  The weak part of the meal was the spaghetti.  There's a balance between too much and too little olive oil for pasta and this failed on the too little side.  There was some oil in the bottom of the bowl and I mixed it around and tried to coat some of the spaghetti the best I could.  I was almost ready to pour some extra on the pasta from the cruet on the table but I opted not to.

After clearing the dishes, I was asked about dessert and Drew brought the menu.  One thing caught my eye--the chocolate zuccotto cake that I had seen in so many of the Yelp photos.  When I ordered that, Drew cautioned me that it was a LARGE piece of cake.  That was OK.  He said, \"We have take out boxes,\" and walked away with a small laugh.  When he came with the cake, I knew why he took the effort to point out the size.  It was large and it's one of the best values for dessert where restaurants tend to charge high prices for small desserts.  It's chocolate cake layered with sambuca mousse.  It was excellent and although it was a bit much, I did not need a take home box.

Service was good, the room is appealing, but it will not be a place to which I return with any regularity.  I noticed the take one home offer and I noticed the large number of people who got the less expensive pasta dishes and had another brought to them in a small shopping bag to take home for the next day's dinner.  This isn't of interest to me but it certainly is for many.  

Maggiano's is OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  I don't have to because it's a mile from home, but that won't make me return quickly."}
{"text":"I LOVE Maggiano's Little Italy.  As far as a chain of Italian restaurants go, this is by far the best in terms of quality and taste.  You really can't go wrong here.

Extensive wine lists, great appetizers and desserts to die for and we haven't even gotten to what they specialize in......Enjoy!  

DO NOT LEAVE without getting their meatballs and a Maggiano's salad!"}
{"text":"Really good food!! I had the chicken alfredo and my friend had the light ziti! It was both very delicious! The sangria was yum, too. I also had dessert, because well, let's face it, dessert is a necessity! The brownie with ice cream in a blueberry sauce... yum. Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"Tooks some friends that were in town from the Midwest for dinner here, and we loved the family style menu!! Great salads, all of the pasta was delish, chicken parm was so crispy & golden!  Could not get enough of their breadsticks & calamari!

We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Der übliche Italian-Style, nicht schlecht aber nicht wirklich italienisch. Wir hatten eine kleine Auswahl von 4 oder 5 Bruschetta, Chicken Alfredo, Shrimps fra diavolo und eine gute Flasche von dem Hauswein sowie eine Flasche Wasser. Riesenportionen, einmal Pasta hätte für uns beide gereicht. Die Nudeln waren weich, der Chicken Alfredo sah man die 2000 kcal schon auf dem Teller an, aber das haben wir vorher gewusst. Die Saucen insgesamt lecker aber sehr schwer und \"sahnelastig\", die Nudeln zu weich, die Bruschetta waren klasse. Gesamt mit Tipp 110 USD - preislich für Las Vegas o.k..

Was mir nicht gefällt - wie überall in Las Vegas laut und voll. Das Restaurant ist vor allem im hinteren Bereich deutlich zu eng bestuhlt, bei den \"Katzentischen\" am Fenster (2er Tische) waren die Gäste mehr damit beschäftigt den von der Klimaanlage herüberwehenden Vorhang zu bändigen, als sich zu unterhalten oder zu essen."}
{"text":"Yummm! Our dinner was so much more than I ever expected. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The portions were huge! I couldn't believe how reasonably priced the menu was as well. We had a corner window table that overlooked the strip. It was perfect for the kids. Strolling musicians and the best chocolate cake topped off the evening! We are going back for a second time tonight and will be sure to visit Maggiano's back home as well."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the excellent staff and the ambiance the food is horrible. A friend of mine came from out of town so I took her out there I was so disappointed with the food the shrimp scampi was ok, their salad indifferent and their veal parmesan was horrible. What next time? Bc there won't be one"}
{"text":"Extremely upset with my service last night. If you get a waiter named Drew, make sure you ask for a change of table or whatever you need to do to get away from him. His temperament is uncanny. At first he was really awesome. Yes I know i can be difficult but it's one thing for your waiter to say that too you without actually saying it. We joked how I wanted the spinach salad except with iceberg lettuce and no pine nuts because of my allergy. But when the salads came out, my dates salad was perfect (he ordered a Cesar salad) and my salad was literally ONLY iceberg. He was so upset and his face turned red. I was fine, like I was a waitress before so I understand the kitchen messes up. So he came back and the salad now only had onions on it. Remind you, I ordered the Spinach Salad so it should have had bacon, blue cheese onion and minus the pine nuts. He walked away so quickly that I didn't get a chance to ask him where the rest of the salad was. Again, I was not upset because things happen and we are regulars at this location. My date flags him down and I notify him that my salad is still incorrect. (THIS IS THE PART WHERE I GET MAD). I tell him what's on it and he goes \"if I get you the Gorgonzola and the bacon will you be happy?\" And I say yes. THEN HE REPEATS IT WITH ATTITUDE \"If I GET you Gorgonzola and the bacon THEN will you be happy?\" Like ... what?! I couldn't BELIVE he was talking to me like that. I was beyond pissed at him, my date (husband) who was trying to make the situation sound okay and the fact that this is ruining my experience at my FAVORITE restaurant. Like I said I was previously a waitress and I know you're under a lot of pressure but there is no need to treat your customers like crap. So I told my husband I wanted to leave. I did not want to be there anymore. The manager walked by numerous times and I was so upset that I could not even begin to form words as to how I was being treated. Drew literally could have been like \" I'm so sorry ma'am let me correct this\" instead I begin to feel self conscious. I was scared to drink all of my drink because I didn't want him to be mad that I drank too fast. I was scared to ask him for more bread! I'm so upset still that I do not even think I want to come back. I couldn't even eat my food when the food came out. I was just ready to go. I went to wait in the car for my husband to pay the bill (we were there because I got a gift card for my birthday! And I feel like it was waisted). When he got in the car he said Drew apologized for his behavior but explained how there was a table that he had that did not speak English. And that pissed me off even more. Like that gives Drew the right to treat someone like shit?! I'm so upset with this location. We eat at Maggiano's in Summerlin about once a month for date night. And this incident makes me want to start eating at the Strip."}
{"text":"The environment is good.
But, my lobster carbonara doesn't have lobster at all.
Instead of lobster, they put crawfish.
The server said that they are cutted lobster, but I definitely know that they were crawfish.
I am so disappointed that this big chain restaurant did this kind of thing.
I will never go back."}
{"text":"Good Italian food, for decent prices! Spacious and attentive service.  Highly recommend trying the patio, it's shaded and if it's not too hot out, should be a nice experience!  

Fried calamari, oven roasted pork loin, chicken parm and tiramisu are a must!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place to have lunch!!! The atmosphere and overall environment of Maggiano's is simple yet elegant and perfect for any lunch or dinner occasion. 

My family and I decided to have a nice Saturday lunch out and Maggiano's couldn't have been more perfect. We were seated right away and our waitress provided great service and was prompt on recognizing if we needed more bread, water, mozzarella cheese, etc. 

I was a little wary of what to expect from the menu as I'm currently trying to lose weight. Luckily, they had lower calorie options for some of their delicious pastas. I ended having the \"lighter take\" of the fettuccine alfredo which had fettuccine noodles,  grilled chicken, asparagus and a light asiago cream sauce. 

My meal was absolutely delicious and I definitely recommend eating here for any lunch or dinner occasion!"}
{"text":"Stuffed mushrooms - good
Spaghetti & Meatballs - good
Free bread and butter - pretty good
We came before the rush, so service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Terrible carry out! I ordered a chopped salad and all I got was lettuce! Hardly any avocado, bacon bits or cheese! Nothing like you get when you eat in. Waste of money! I could have bought lettuce at the grocery store for $1.00!  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I tried to go here last night; party of five.  The hostess told us that it would be an hour and 45 minutes before we could be seated, even though there were only a couple of people waiting and there were a few tables inside and all but two tables outside were being used.

No problem, we went downstairs to RA and had a great meal."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of four for my fiancé's mom's birthday.  

Our server was a gentleman named Asaad, and he was fantastic.  Probably one of the best meal services I've had in my life.  He checked in on us regularly, filled our water quickly, got us more bread when we needed it, and had a great attitude all night.  We weren't even going to mention that we had a birthday until he asked us what the occasion was -- and then for dessert, he brought the birthday lady a crème brulee with a cute, little sparkler!  He was just wonderful!

We started out with the stuffed mushrooms, which were so flavorful, stuffed with this tasty filling that added both texture and flavor.  The mushrooms themselves were cooked perfectly, meaty and fragrant.  

Everyone enjoyed their entrees.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan -- to be honest, I thought the marinara was a little on the salty side, which is why I'm deducting a star.  My fiancé's baked ziti was pretty good, too, but I think our homemade ziti's a bit better since we don't skimp on the sausage and cheese.  

We got two orders of pasta to go for lunch tomorrow, and I thought that was kind of a cool experience.  Between the two of us, my fiancé and I got four meals for $40!  What a value!  The fettuccini I had today was tasty!

 As a note, Maggiano's also has gluten-free pasta as an option for those who are interested.  My fiancé's mom was ecstatic since she has celiac. 

The cheesecake was heavenly.  I don't know how they make it, but I think it's better than Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake.  It was wonderfully creamy with just enough tang from the strawberries.  The crust was baked perfectly, and the whipped cream on top was rich and sweet.

Overall, we had a wonderful time!  We will be back when we're craving Italian!"}
{"text":"This place is so heart warming. Hard working people doing their best to accommodate you. My order is quite complicated due to allergies, & when I explained to the waitress she went over it with me & was so nice about it. 

Later everyone's food comes out & im waiting for mine for a couple minutes. I assumed since it was a harder order it would take a minute. Didn't mind. She checked up on us a lot. 

She comes out & apologizes profusely & says they messed up & read the order wrong & that it would be out asap. There it was perfect & great. It means a lot that they didn't just give me the effed up order & or scrape off what I'm allergic to. 

I'm so glad they're so allergy conscious here. Everyone is so kind & happy. It's a nice change. Will do take away orders in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in the world. Great location with amazing scenery!

I always get the famous d 
& I will continue to do so. 

I have certain food allergies that keep me from eating things made in this dish but they're more than happy to make me a new batch without said ingredients. 

10/10 would recommend to a friend. 

Thanks for existing.

{"text":"3 1/2 stars to be fair.

I went to Maggiano's for lunch during a business seminar.  Don't you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work?  It was certainly a nice treat for me!

After initial introductions and the start of the seminar, food starting coming out of the kitchen.  All served family style which was a bit odd for me because I barely knew the two dozen people in the room!  But ah, not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono...or a cold for that matter.

Our appetizer courses came first:  along with warm French bread (excellent) we had the:

*Tomato Caprese - tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil, topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze

*Mozzarella Marinara - breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce

*Maggiano's Salad - Iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese, crispy prosciutoo, red onions, topped with their signature dressing

Pretty good start!  The salad was crisp, but my fav was the Tomato Caprese, sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic?  Very nice!  I didn't try the Mozzarella Marinara in trying to keep with my P90X diet...damn you I say Tony Horton!

Next up was our main courses:

*Chicken Parmesan - Breaded chicken breasts baked with Provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti

*Our Famous Rigatoni 'D' - Rigatoni with herb-roasted chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions with a Marsala cream sauce

*Mom's Lasagna-Meat Sauce - Pasta layered with Ricotta cheese, meatballs, Italian sausage, and marinara sauce, topped with Provolone cheese and meat sauce

Nice!  All were good.  Unfortunately, I ate like a banshee here...I dug the Chicken Parmesan and Mom's Lasagna very much!  The sauce was great, not too sweet, not too tart, and complemented the dishes very well.  Oh my thighs...the horror!!!

After the business presentation dessert was brought out:

*Apple Crostada - Granny Smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar, topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream

*Chocolate Zuccotto Cake - Chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse, iced with chocolate frosting, then dusted with cocoa powder

At this point I was too full to have any more!  But I gave in and had a bit of the Apple Crostada.  Yummy to my tummy!  The tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust.  Good way to end the meal.  Bad way to end my diet!

Food here is great for a chain restaurant.  The ambiance is nice, dark woods and colors.  It would be very nice for a date night out.  I may just come back here again and actually shell out my Visa to try more of their dishes.  As a note though, I did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side.  But, one dish could probably feed two people easily. 

Thankful for my one day reprieve...I am back to my P90X diet and the ramblings of the Devil's Spawn named Tony Horton.  One more push up or pull up and I think I'm gonna be sick!"}
{"text":"food was fantastic as always, as well as our server Mac! only bad thing was I made reservations & said we would be celebrating a birthday.. double checked with the host when we got there that it was in the notes & not once were we acknowledged for my grandmas birthday"}
{"text":"The service here was good - however the food was not great and over priced.  There are other great restaurants in DTS so don't waste your time here.  Our food tasted like a frozen TV dinner microwaved too long.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible service they use to be good but really bad now. Waited for 1.5 hours to sit down (yes I know I am dumb !) and then the food took another 40 minutes ... like I was here for over 3 hours to just have dinner .... Not even like we were drinking and chilling ! 

They use to be good."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food next to getting on a plane and going to Italy. I took my twins for lunch and we were missing dad whom loved this restaurant. It was nice to eat here we sat at the table that we last dined at together. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so loving and somewhat something out of a 1950s movie. Even the music is correct for the period. We sat close to the window and  got to remember and celebrate a life that is watching over us now.

I love the larger portions here so I ordered a large Caesar salad and we ended up having left overs that it was so large. For the entree we spilt the Mamas lasagna. The lasagna here tasted like something that my mother would make too. It was not at all spicy or even left an after taste. 

Sometimes we need dessert and today we did. Our server talked us into a creme brûlée, which has strawberries in it. We also tried the marshmallow s'more. It is a s'more on steroids!
The desserts were amazing. The s'more melts in your mouth and takes one back to those camping trips but making new ones. The Carmel that surrounds the s'more makes it indulgent."}
{"text":"The braised beef canneloni seemed like such a good idea, and it would've been if I would have thought to buy a case of Gatorade before I ate it.  Seeing as how I didn't, this meal ended up being pretty disappointing.  I can just imagine the exchange at Maggiano's \"food school\" or wherever they develop their dishes:

\"People like braised stuff these days, right?\"
\"Yeah.\"

\"And balsamic vinegar is, like, all the rage, is it not?\"
\"Indeed it is.\"

\"If a dish 'needs a little something,' it is more often than not salt, correct?\"
\"Yes, good sir, salt is the magic missing ingredient every time!\"

\"Would you say, then, that if we put an ounce of salt into each dish, it is unlikely that our customers would feel that the dish was lacking salt?\"
\"Indeed.\"

\"OK, so let's braise some meat, stuff it into noodles, develop a sauce that has balsamic vinegar as its primary ingredient, and add as much salt as we can.  Be sure to add the salt when the sauce is near boiling so as to create a supersaturated solution.\"
\"Brilliant!\"

\"Can you think of anything else?\"
\"Yes... texture is all the rage these days.  Perhaps we could disrupt this dish with some completely misplaced and undercooked root vegetables!  What could be finer than intermingling some crisp fresh carrots with the melt-in-your-mouth beef?\"
\"Not a damned thing - let it be done!\"

The funny thing is that there is actually an article out on The Google about how they make this very dish.  I may have been slightly off in a couple of my details...

The formula for this restaurant is to take Olive Garden's horrible menu, dress it up a little bit, add dark wood and white linens, and make believe it's gourmet.  

It's a great formula for a successful restaurant, but not much of a formula for great food."}
{"text":"Had a dinner meeting for 25 last Thursday night... from Lawrence the main catering guy to Jaime to the wait staff the bar tenders and the bus folks, we had some of the best customer service that I have ever experienced. Seriously, great food, help with our technical difficulties, and lovely setting!  Thank you!

{"text":"Been to maggiano's in New Jersey. Better experience there. From the hostess who ignored us and spent time talking to servers while she saw us waiting to the waiter who put in the wrong salad order to the server who brought us our main course before we were finished with the salad the employees were not the best. The food was very good so that is the only thing that kept me from giving 2 stars. Maybe it was a bad night for the workers. ( main courses cooled down while we were finishing our salads in a hurry. Couldn't linger over salads since our food was already on the table. )"}
{"text":"This is easily the best Italian restaurant on the strip. They have a great happy hour and very reasonable prices, by Vegas standards. Our server, Stephanie, was lovely and made several excellent wine and food recomemdations. I had an app and entree of their specials list, both of which were outstanding and overflowing with lobster (the ingredient of the day). Sadly we were too full for dessert, but we had such an amazing meal that I didn't even miss it as my SO rolled me out the door."}
{"text":"Decent meal and good service. Was impressed for a chain restaurant. Was a little more expensive than I expected. Good crowd, place was packed at 7pm."}

After shopping decided to stop by to get something to eat. Very reasonable price!!! 
The server we had very nice guy, really took care of us."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and the wait was pretty long so we opted to sit at the bar.  The service was ok, it seemed the waitress was trying hard to get the food out, but it being the bar it wasn't as fast as it usually is. 

I ordered the 4-cheese ravioli, and I LOVE cheese ravioli at restaurants...and I get it, its supposed to taste like cheese but this ravioli was so overwhelmingly cheesy that you couldn't really taste the sauce or anything else! My husband ordered the baked ziti and while it was good, we've had better.  The bread basket was cold and hard but the next basket was a little warmer. 

The drinks were mixed here mine was pure vodka (but its Vegas right?..I can't complain!) but my husbands was a little watered down. 

All in all it was an ok place, but there is better Italian food to be had."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant for a chain. The decor is cozy, the service is outstanding, and the food is wonderful! Everything is good. My family especially loves the pasta dishes where you get to bring one home :) Olive Garden just started copying them, but I would choose Maggiano's over OG any day!!"}
{"text":"I was around and decided to try Magiano who just opened in downtown Summerlin..  asked my server if they have any Vegan meal. The Chef came out with the biggest smile ( I thought the Italian mafia going to kill me and buried me in the desert) but gave me couple options. I was delighted to know I can eat some Angel pasta with vegetables and Primavera sauce. Great service as well (if the server can stop to call me Boss on every sentence and replace \"Boss\" by \"Sir\" it will be great.. Thank you for the present as well when I left. Thank you Maggiano's  and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This visit was to celebrate Alicia R's birthday.  The Wonder Twins (aka Terri R and Alicia R) invited me and you know I am not turning down a good meal with the hottest twins in Las Vegas. Besides, it's been forever since I step foot in here.  It's had to be at least 5 years and I've been really missing out. 

I've only been to one other Maggiano's and that one is located in Costa Mesa.  Maggiano's use to be the place where my favorite sister would take me for my birthday.  All I remember from Maggiano's is a lot of good food, huge portions, great service, and long waits even with a reservation.  

This Maggiano's is a lot similar to the Costa Mesa location.  This place was packed on Friday, great food, huge portions, and great service.  Only difference, which is a big one, there was zero wait.  I had their Parmesan Crusted Tilapia which was really good and the portions had to be triple of what you get compared to other restaurants. The $20 price tag is pretty good considering that I had over 10 oz of great tasting fish.  After my meal, I washed it down with 3 scoops for their Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  I offered to share, but everyone in our table had their own treat.  I didn't want to put my dessert to waste, so I killed it. 

There's not too many Maggiano's around in any city.  I believe that this is the only one in Las Vegas.  I've never had a poor experience at Maggiano's and recommend if you're looking for fine Italian food with huge portions. 

PS:  Happy Birthday to Alicia R. (aka Terri R's twin, aka my 5K partner, aka my half marathon inspiration, aka Yes, and aka the former Finger Printing Lady).  Ha Ha...and more nicknames to come."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their \"policy\" regarding large parties. I tried to make a reservation for 11 people and was told we would have to order the family style dinner, which was priced at $37/person. When I told them we would prefer to order single meals they said we would have to split our party up and sit separately. Why would we sit separately when we wanted to eat as group? It should be the customers choice whether they order family style or single meals. Due to this incident, we went elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"A quiet comfortable experience with great food. 

Despite being such a large establishment Maggiano's Little Italy is a home-y, personable atmosphere. Our waiter, Billy, was very friendly and made us feel like valued guests--almost as if he had invited us into his home. I wanted a glass of wine to start but I didn't know what to order from the large selection of wines on the menu. Billy was able to make an excellent recommendation by asking me a few questions about what I like. I wish I could remember what it was :(

I ordered the Taylor Street Baked Ziti which comes loaded with Italian Sausage, Pomodoro Sauce, and an Italian cheese blend. Just thinking about it again makes me want to Fed Ex an order of it to Edmonton right now. But Canadian Customs would probably eat it all at the airport.

The selection of entrees at Maggiano's is large and it was difficult making a choice of which to order. The Baked Eggplant Parmesan, Chef Mann's Country-Style Pasta, Chicken Parmesan, etc. are all on my radar for future visits to this restaurant. In addition to pasta there is a decent sized seafood menu.

The portions are large and the prices are right. It's $15 - 20 on average for the pasta dishes with the seafood being around $21 - 30 (unless it's lobster tails then you're paying more).

Maggiano's is clearly about creating a delicious, comfortable experience that makes customers want to return. That is such a rarity in today's corporate culture which simply treats consumers like a number. I can't wait to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Why am I just now discovering that this place has a patio I've eaten downstairs at the Mexican restaurant in the sushi restaurant 25 times but never up here at this place sat outside on the patio had a great lunch love the view.

My server Shanna was a little sassy when I asked for more bread her reply was \"I'll get you more bread when I have time\"  I would've like something a little nicer like a \"no problem I'll bring you some more bread \" but that's my only complaint and I'm still leaving five stars.

Maybe she's mad shit to work on Valentine's Day maybe your man didn't get her flowers maybe she's mad she had to come all the way out to the patio I don't know but overall had a great lunch



 I had the meatball sandwich and a cuppa soup it was great"}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I come here , I fall in love with the pizza over and over. My brother and I ordered a 18' traditional size and we only had two pieces left . This to say next time we won't be as greedy and order a smaller one. Left wanting to try the cheesecake , but I was super full and couldn't do it. So next time, small pizza with dessert  it is."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated restaurant on the second floor of the fashion show mall, across the street from the Wynn. The food was amazing. We had the calamari appetizer and garlic bread. The seafood pasta was loaded clams, shrimp,lobster, and muscles in a rich red sauce. Absolutely delicious. The spaghetti and meatball is also amazing, it comes with a huge, tasty meatball. The portions are big so it's best to come hungry and share an entree. It's obvious that this establishment uses fresh, quality ingredients. Our waiter, Mark, was the absolute best and so on top of everything. Everyone was so nice and I especially loved guy who greeted each table with beautiful songs. This was without a doubt the best place we have eaten during our stay. The atmosphere is classy but without the snobbishness and the view of the strip is also a plus. Best to make a reservation."}

{"text":"MAGGIANO'S LITTLE ITALY ... EPIC FAIL LAST NIGHT!


OK, so last night (10/2/13) we returned to Maggiano's Little Italy restaurant in the Fashion Show Center, on the Vegas strip, expecting our usual fine dining experience.  But things went badly awry.  

Here's how our evening went:
* 5:00 -  check in and immediately get seated in a nice booth with a view of the Strip.  So far, so good.
* 5:15 -  finally get some water.  Hmmm.
* 5:25 -  finally asked what we wanted to drink.  As we already had plenty of time to ponder, we immediately gave our entire order.
* 5:40 -  bread and olive oil arrive.
* 5:55 -  bruschetta and salad finally arrive.  Really, 30 minutes for bruschetta and a house salad?
* 6:25 -  entrées finally arrive.  No special requests, mind you, just the house special.  WTH!
* 6:35 -  we ask for our bill and some take-home containers, so we can head out to our show.
* 6:50 -  we sign our bill and head out, thank heavens.

How about the food?  Salad dressing contained some new, hotter peppers than previously.  Wife took a few bites and quit.  Bruschetta was good.

Entrées were very disappointing.  We had our usual Rigatoni \"D\", a house specialty, which is usually excellent.  Not so, last night.  The sauce was so watered down that it wouldn't adhere to any of the rigatoni, mushrooms or chicken.  We had to dunk our bread into it to get any, or it just dripped off like water.  

My wife plans to \"doctor\" the sauce a bit to make it workable, and we'll try the leftovers tonight.  Hope she can fix it.

Last night Maggiano's failed badly.  Never had that happen at Gaetano's ... ever.  Guess where we're going from now on.

{"text":"The price is right for decent Italian food in Vegas- I think each person in our group of 5 was very satisfied with their meal, and this was a great restaurant option for a large group, given the diversity of their food and drink menu and their location in a large mall, set a bit back from the strip.

The staff was very nice and accommodating of our requests for substitutions and split checks, and we even left the restaurant with to-go boxes, which is always a plus for Vegas, when late-night pasta cravings hit after a night out. I managed to polish off my lemon butter salmon and side of vegetables (both delicious) and they include fresh bread at the table that's great for sopping up sauce on the plate- exactly what i expect of an Italian restaurant! I would definitely recommend Maggiano's if you're looking for food for a large group in Vegas that doesn't break your wallet."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, delicious and the portions were  huge so we have leftovers. The picture is their gnocchi and Italian sausage, I tried their famous rigatoni \"D\" in a light Marsala sauce - amazing!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's never disappoints!  From their soft, yet crusty bread to their house salad with unbelievable dressing, just the first part of the meal is incredible!  I highly recommend the lobster carbonara!  It has tons of chunks of lobster, so it's definitely worth the price!  

We made reservations at 8 and, while they were unable to seat us any earlier than 8, they were very prompt in getting us a table shortly thereafter.  

The service was great and the view of the Wynn was awesome!  Whether you're in Vegas or any other city that offers Maggiano's, I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My in-laws love this place so we went for dinner with a group of 8 with their CHASE rewards.

First of all, make sure you make your reservations really far in advance. They made them a couple weeks ahead of time on a weekend and there still was only a 5:30 or 9:30 reso. if you make a reservation for a large group of people they make you wait for everyone to get there to sit down. This was annoying because the last two in our party were late and we were getting hungry.

The ambiance was really cool! The lighting is nice for a large group or a date. Their service was ok. The server poured the rest of our bottle of wine and then didn't ask us if we wanted another bottle. We weren't finished with our meal so I thought that wasn't very smart of him.... More $$ more tip...

The food was pretty good for a corporate place. Very corporate, like a Buca Di Beppo or a Macaroni Grill but a little bit better. 

I give it a 4 instead of a 3 because I feel it wasn't just \"ok\". The atmosphere and the singer guy with an accordion player accompaniment really stepped up the review from a 3 to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration!  Had the family style as there was 10 of us.  The service as well as the food was amazing!  It was the second time we had Mike as our waiter and he is friendly and keeps the food coming!  He also gave us some great recommendations!
We will ask for him when we return!"}
{"text":"I love the Maggiano's in my home town, so I thought why not in vegas!? It's right across from my hotel and I know the food is awesome.

Everything was great until we walked back to our hotel and took a nap. We all woke up feeling super sick. 

But lemme talk about the actual experience in the restaurant. It was a super long wait for 5pm but we got hooked up and passed the line. We were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner. The food was the same as always and it wasn't better or worse than any other Maggiano's I've been to except for the part where we all got sick. 

Oh well."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. The decor is nicely appointed; classy yet not ostentatious. The wait staff was young but knowledgeable, friendly and helpful but never intrusive. I had the linguine di mare which was perfectly prepared. It was mildly spicy and contained a nice mixture of lobster, shrimp, mussels and clams. Though I found it very generous with the lovely shrimp, I found it less than generous with the lobster - I found one small piece on my plate. The clams and mussels were tasty but rather small. One of my companions had the seared tuna which he very much enjoyed. The portion was large and was cooked perfectly medium rare with an ideal 1/8 inch seared thickness all around and a rare center. My other companion had the Parmesan crusted tilapia. It was well cooked and tasty. We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of their nice house chianti. For dessert, the three of us shared a generous and quite delicious order of the cannoli cake. With two rounds of drinks and tip, the bill was $240 for the three of us. A very enjoyable experience well suited to a special occasion."}
{"text":"Delish! I didn't have the opportunity to dine in, as we were picking up food for our company party, but I have to say the take out area was convenient and the girls were very friendly and organized. It helped that the Take out was seperate from the main enterance and that they had curb side pull up (Take note: lunch hour is VERY busy).

I had the pleasure of having a lil bit of everything we ordered, being that this was my first 'expereince with Maggiano's I wanted to ensure of course that I gave it a fair shot on my review ha. Who are we kidding, the food was amazing. The lasagna with meat sauce, Chicken Parm, Chopped salad and Caesar salad all delicious. 

We got the 1/2 orders of the catered dishes, which for all of the above (which came with rolls) was enough for an office of 16. The food portions were perfect with leftovers to spare.

Looking forward to experiencing the dining in abiance, in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I sat on the bar side which received enough light from the windows.First the waitress brought bread to the table with oil that she mixed with parmesan cheese.I have never been a fan of dipping my bread in oil however I tried it and it was very good. I ended up eating two pieces. I had the famous rigatoni D for my dinner. It was delicious. The sauce was perfect amount and creamy. Being that my meal was on the classic menu I also got eggplant parmesan to bring home free as a second meal. I felt the price was reasonable. Staff was friendly. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Best Italian Food in Vegas!  Wouldn't go to Vegas without eatting there!  Veal parmesian to-die-for!  One problem/do you know people can lean their big butts against the front window where u r eatting, and smoke their cigarettes right there?! Super GROSS!  Mgr. had to move US to a different table, he's not allowed to post a non-smoking sign outside!!?? Or ask persons to not loiter!  Unheard of!  Will definately ask for a window without \"the cigarette and butt views\" next time.....  Disgusting.  I'd like to say the ambience was great, but that REALLY ruins it...."}
{"text":"When you first walk inside Maggiano's, the restaurant receptionist is towards the back and I was not aware. There were people standing around and a customer had to guide to the location. (Not organized). 

10 minutes later, I finally received my buzzer because it was really busy night. An hour later, we were seated. Once seated, a waitress assisted us very quickly. I was asking for a recommendation on wine other than moscato and she suggested moscato (even though I stated \"besides moscato). So moscato was ordered. 

Our food and the price of the meal did not compare. Our meal was mediocre. I think I had high expectations due to the wait time and I see this place is popular. 

Not sure if I would go again unless I have a gift card or coupon."}
{"text":"A great Italian spot in a nice area, with decor that makes it seem more upscale. The service is pretty good and fairly consistent. However, this restaurant is always packed during the weekends, so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. We love that their classic pastas include a dish to take home, and the pastas themselves are served in generous portions. Also, Marco's Meal for Two is a good option if you typically order appetizers and dessert. Sign up for their email club for frequent coupons. Some of the dishes we've ordered:
- Taylor Street Baked Ziti: delicious; their sauce tends to be more on the tangy side but is more muted in the take-home dish
- Tuscan Shrimp & Chicken: GREAT gem on the menu; has generous helpings of shrimp (at least 10 fresh, large ones), ham, and chicken; the sauce clearly incorporates red pepper; lots of cheese but not too overwhelming
- Braised Beef Pappardelle: beef is very tasty and is similar to the texture you would find in a beef stew; sauce is actually quite enjoyable but the portion was noticeably smaller than the ziti
- Linguine di Mare: seafood portion (mussels, etc.) are on the petite side; sauce is slightly runny and I would like it to be thicker; based on my experiences of seafood from New England, more spices would improve the dish- overall, doesn't live up to the price
- Linguine & Clams: the clam portion is not bad, tends to be a little watery, contains a lot of shallots & garlic
- Lighter Take Fettuccine Alfredo: although it boasts asparagus and chicken, the sauce barely adds any flavor
- Rigatoni D: previously a family favorite, but the sauce has recently become more vinegar-like"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food in town. Great atmosphere and location with very reasonable prices considering. Go there on a once a month basis and have no intentions on that changing. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Long time Fan

Too bad we have been huge fans of Maggiano's since we lived in Southern California and went to the one in Costa Mesa.  We looked up their closing time before driving all the way to Scottsdale from Chandler only to be shocked when we arrived at 10:09pm that they closed at 10pm and they would not seat us.  Ok, I guess it is google's fault because Yelp has the correct closing time, but the manager should have intervened and made an exception.  To his credit he did offer to give us a gift card and seemed very apologetic and didn't know how to resolve this... Maybe this little star will help motivate him and the rest of the restaurant to fix this."}
{"text":"There's a Maggiano's in my hometown of San Jose. Strangely enough, I have never been to that place. So this was my first time ever at Maggiano's! Whoa.

We pretty much hit the jackpot with parking. The underground lot of the Fashion Show mall has several entrances, and although we entered from the south end of the mall, we found our way to the northeast corner (which was actually near an exit) and found a perfect, surprisingly non-wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of Maggiano's.

After walking through to the host desk at the front, we got seated fairly quickly. It was a busy lunch hour, but not absolutely jampacked. We were seated by a window, thankfully, and we got to see some of the Wynn and Palazzo. I had a blast watching the Wynn divider move up and down the LED screen. Who needs a TV?

I somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee. I was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week, so it was worth every penny of the $2.95. Our server was funny though. He took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left, even though it's kinda assumed that most people (including yours truly) are right-handed.

I have a lot of love for the Baked Eggplant Parmesan. So does my mom. She ordered it (and saved the leftovers for a special someone) along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers. My aunt went with the Linguini and Clams with white clam sauce, and I had the Veal Parmesan.

Just like in most Italian restaurants, we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil / vinegar dipping sauce. Nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside. What more do you want?

The mushrooms came out first of the orders, and they were delicious. Couldn't care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus (with spinach and garlic). According to my mom, the version she knows from San Jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms. I guess you gotta go big in Vegas though, and I didn't mind fork-and-knifing it. I thought that the parmesan cheese available table-side did enhance the flavor, which some might view as a shortcoming.

I sampled some linguini too. It's pretty good, although the clam-to-noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen, in a not-that-appealing way. I like to have more of a balance of protein and starch.

My veal was nicely pounded, breaded, and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes. The melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements. I just realized that I didn't dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving, which makes me a bit sad.

Overall, it was good, solid Italian food. One of the best parts, really, was the view, which strongly correlates with the obvious Las Vegas Strip price markups. It's alright though - I would have been hard-pressed to spend the $50 in gift cards at another time. Yay for heavy reductions on out-of-pocket costs!"}
{"text":"We've twice dined here w/friends and though the food was okay, it wasn't worth the crowd/hassle/money. One friend is vegan and he had a very hard time finding much to eat. The worst was the service, esp the hosts. Once they insisted (after we'd already waited 45min w/a reservation!) that a baby be counted as a full person (mind you, this was a newborn being carried by mom) thus we'd need a table for five, not four, and this increased our wait even more. We left and went to Harper's (Yummy!). 

Another time, they wouldn't seat us on time b/c our entire party hadn't aarrived yet. Are you kidding me? You are going to give away our reserved table instead of letting us start our night w/cocktails and apps? Five of us were there, two were 10 minutes away; adding insult to injury, they squished us around a small table when we were finally seated.   My friend must've been wearing some sorta cloaking device b/c everytime she opened her mouth the waiter didn't even acknowledge her existence. It actually became kkinda comical.

You know, I'vd put up w/some pretty crappy service for some awesome food, but if you are going to be a schmuck, you'd best put your money where your mouth is and offer me something more than a step above Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The food is always so good but this is about our last visit on the 4th of July.  Our waiter Andrew was excellent and so knowledgeable.  Food was excellent as well.  Always a treat and such great views."}
{"text":"The first two times we ate at Little Italy, the food was amazing. We decided to stop in for dinner this evening. I ordered the Lasagna which was pretty good with the exception of biting in to a hard piece of fat in the meat and the food not being hot. My Brother loves the tortellina Alfredo so he ordered it. He said it was bland and there were no spices in it. We asked our waitress if perhaps there was a different chef on duty. She told us their Executive Chef was in this evening! We're taking a break from Maggianos for awhile. We were very disappointed with our dinners. Our waitress told us that she informed someone about our food. Unfortunately no Manager came to our table to speak with us. There was a private party going on in the back of the restaurant, so I suppose they were more important than the other customers. We were also seated right in front of a keyboard player and a singer. My Brothers back was to them and he was literally two feet in front of them. He was really uncomfortable, so we left as soon as we could."}
{"text":"Food and service is outstanding! Baked ziti is amazing!!!! Along with the best Salmon salad. I'd say their pre opening was perfect all around from service, food, and experience"}
{"text":"Yummmm - BEST Italian Food in Southern Nevada HANDS DOWN!

Ask for Marco's Meal deal to get 2 pastas and dessert at a discount.

Locals, ask for the take one deal so you get a free take-home pasta, it's like 2-for-1 and the 2nd pasta can be different from the one you eat in store.

The singer is great, and the bread is fresh!!!"}
{"text":"We are locals and we've been here before with the kids,  It was very good at that time. This time was excellent,  I had the shrimp and chicken dish with prosciutto with a red pepper sauce highly recommend this dish. Overall exceptional especially our server Mark."}
{"text":"This was my first time
Coming here and I had such high hopes for this place. I sat at the bar and the service was very slow there were only 2 bartenders for the whole restaurant apparently. My friend and I ordered I had a steak with lobster on top and the seafood was imitation meat I believe. It was not good. The steak was just ok nothing memorable. 

For Customer service there was a gentlemen kind of young at the bar he was very sweet. He ended up getting swamped with drinks and We ended up getting serviced by this older woman who kept ignoring us but being attentive to everyone else around us. We thought it was very weird. 

I wasn't wowed by anything... probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Poor Customer service. Good food. 

Let me start my novel with we had reservations for 8:45pm. We arrived at 8:25pm. They sat us at approximately 9pm. When we walked to our table we counted over half a dozen empty tables empty, cleaned and set for customers. They sat us at a table in the back of the restaurant and as soon as we had sat down then proceed to ask us to move to an alternate table so they could push the current table and the adjacent table together for a larger party. Really after waiting you then ask us to move? Poor planning? So we sit down at new table and proceed to order a bottle of wine. The server opens to bottle table side, does not as for a taste tester (so is this supposed to be fine dining or not?). He proceeds to pour the bottle into the glasses. We had a party of four. He runs out of the wine when he reaches glass three. The kicker is he said \"I will let you guys redistribute that\". Wait what? Did you really just say that the empty glass that is sitting in front of me I should pass around the table to my friends, that by the way have already drank out of their glasses, to get them to fill my glass?!?!?! Thats just 50 shades of wrong. So at this point the Manager actually seeks us out because she had \"heard\" we may be having some issues. Well you think?!?!? We did give her the opportunity to walk away by says \"you really don't want to hear what we ha e to say\", but to her credit she stayed and listened. She did offer to get me a glass of wine on the house to make up for the miss-pour from the server and offer to get an appetizer for the table. We had already placed orders for the Marcos Meal Special which comes with apprizers, so we declined as two appetizers were already on the way. So on to the food...
Appetizers:
*tomato caprese - tomatoes with mozzarella cheese drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette - good
*sausage and peppers - good
Entree:
*four cheese ravioli - I did not know it had a pesto (green) sauce? I saw it delivered to another table with red (tomato) sauce? Did not care for the green sauce, ravioli was tasty and had a generous amount of filling. 
*chicken parmesan - tasty 
*lasagna - tasty
*chicken and spinach manicotti - tasty and had a generous amount of filling. 
Dessert:
*tiramisu - awesome
*creme brûlée - awesome
With the Marco's meals we got meals to go...3 lasagna and a baked ziti. We will see how that turns out tomorrow."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place! I wrote a review for Maggiano's a while ago stating that it was just ok ( that was a location in California). But this Maggiano's is really good. Whether going in for a drink and some appetizers, or ordering a full dinner, you will love the variety and taste of the Italian food.  Plus, it overlooks part of the strip! Fun!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while and it was very yummy. Glad to see the recession didn't drag the quality down like at so many other chains."}
{"text":"Took my best friend out last night and it was great. My flight was a little late getting in so I notified the host, she said there would be no problem.  Nathan was our server. He was professional and not overbearing. The food was delicious, it always is. But, considering I've eaten at Maggiano's from Seattle to DC, I'd like to say you've got some great going on here, thanks."}
{"text":"My co worker and I arrived here during the week for lunch. I parked in the parking structure of the mall which has a elevator that takes you right into the back of the restaurant. We requested to be seated on the patio which gave us a great view of Las Vegas Blvd.

Our waiter was prompt in getting our beverages, rolls and recommended the lighter four cheese ravioli which I ordered. For being a lighter entrée it definitely didn't lack flavor, was filling and tasted delicious. My co worker went for the salmon sammie and also enjoyed the food. Heart the ambiance here and the old style Vegas feel especially with the Sinatra music.

Overall a splendid lunch with a great view. I definitely will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic as always. I got the four cheese ravioli. It was the best thing that could happen to me on a Monday. They did change their bread from the last time I went. But it was still wonderful."}
{"text":"Ma-Ma-Ma-Maggiano's I sure love you!  Why? Because you make my tummy happy!

I have been going to Maggiano's on and off since the Las Vegas location opened.  I had never heard of the chain before because I am not really an Italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town.  I went here for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since!  

Before Maggiano's, I was a pasta hater.  I know, I know, I am a weirdo, but I just wasn't into any pasta.  I would only eat it if I had to, but it was never a first, second, or third choice for me.  That was until I had the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti.  This is in my Top 10 dishes ever.  That very night after eating this dish, I kid you not, I had a dream about it.  Yes, when I have a great meal, I will dream about it.  I still get this dish 99% of the time.  Every time I get it, it makes my whole day.  If I could get away with it in public, I would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because I don't want to waste one drop of that awesome Alfredo goodness.  When I do try a different dish, I often feel like I am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti Yes, I love it that much.

I have tried a few other dishes (while having a food affair) and they have all been good.  I really have enjoyed the Chicken Saltimbocca, Eggplant Parm, Lasagna, and the Beef Tenderloin Medallions.  I don't think I have ever heard anyone I was with not like one of their dishes.  Yummy yum.

The kid's menu is also fantastic as well.  The food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates.  They have all sorts of pasta options, chicken fingers, and pizza.  The kid's chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes, I steal my kid's food on occasion.  Every kid's meal is $5.95 for a big entree, dessert, and a drink.  This is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kid's mediocre food.  I love a good deal!

One good tip I have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time.  This particular location always seems to be busy, no matter what time of day.  They are on OpenTable.com, so making a reservation is super easy 24/7.  

If you have never been to a Maggiano's, you should give it a try.  And of course my recommendation would be the Chicken and Spinach Manicotti!"}
{"text":"Solid Italian. It's not the best or worst but good enough for repeat visits. I guess it's great value if you're having their staple pasta. We like the fried calamari and mussels. Their salads are good although too much dressing for me so I ask for it on the light side.
Their Apple crostata is delicious."}
{"text":"I like Maggiano's for some of their solid pasta dishes. It's a chain but they're good. It's not the best, and it's not as refined but they do some things really well. It's splitting hairs from a 3-1/2 to 4 but, my family will go to Maggiano's a few times a month -- 1) because my son loves pasta and the food is generally good, 2) prices are very reasonable, 3) service is good and 4)it's less than 5 minutes from my house.

I do have to tell them to go light on the dressing on the salads. We always get the fried calamari. They're crisp and hot. My son and husband will always get the spaghetti bolognese. I get the seafood pasta. We've also had lasagna as well which is good. I've had their alfredo pasta as well. It's good, and I've had the lighter version as well. Unfortunately, we don't venture too far from these. This is where we get our ordinary pasta. It's consistent. 

When we first came to Maggiano's, we tried other dishes like the meats and poultry, but they weren't our favorite. We also went for brunch once for their brunch menu, and we decided that we come to Maggiano's for spaghetti. We've also had garlic bread once and that was the last time we ordered that."}
{"text":"Love their hot bread and vinegar to start with! Lobster carbonara was the best! Stuffed mushrooms were to die for!!"}
{"text":"My first time dining at Maggiano's was in Florida a couple years ago. I fell in love with it! I came back home, to Vegas, and was unaware we had one here until I went to the Fashion Show Mall. They never cease to amaze me. From their freshly baked bread that's still hot when brought to your table, to their absolutely delicious 4 Cheese Ravioli, you can't go wrong dining here. Our waitress was this super sweet lady who was obviously from a different country. I can't remember her name, but she was the best. Couldn't ask for a better server. The hostess was a bit... Off setting. She didn't look very happy. But I've been a hostess before and I know how stressful it can be. A smile will go a long way though (:"}
{"text":"Great food and a romantic atmosphere. Came with my husband for our anniversary dinner and it was perfect. Our server Drew was very attentive and made great recommendations. Hoping to come back for the Valentines Day menu."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Maggiano's for my cousin's sweet 16. The restaurant is equipped with a full bar and large dining area. Moreover, Maggiano's has a great family atmosphere with cool decor. 

The preselected menu was family style all you can eat. We had Italian tossed salad, mozzerella marinara, tuscan chicken and shrimp, Chef mans pasta which is pasta with chicken meatballs asparagus in a garlic lemon wine sauce, chicken saltimbocca, and balsimic grilled salmon. The mouth watering goodness didn't stop there! For desert we had warm apple crostada and New York style cheesecake. The food was so tasty! I can't wait to go back. 

The staff was amazing! They were very attentive for our party of (16). They made sure our drinks were always full and were very pleasant. 

All in all a great experience. I would recommend Maggiano's to anyone that likes Italian food."}
{"text":"What; The Fuck! There is a HUUUGE rift in the taste bud department. I really don't know how to say this without completely insulting SOME reviewers but do you have any fucking taste buds? How the hell does this shitbox get 4 solid stars and over 100 reviews?????? Please, someone? This is garbage. GARBAGE. It has been awhile since I've eaten at a chain restaurant and it will be another decade before I do again it seems. Here is what I know, this is what I've eaten. 
Gnocchi w/ Sausage in a Vodka Cream Sauce. I don't care if the sausage was good or if the sauce was perfect. The Gnocchi was TERRIBLE! Gummy, Dense, Thick....DEES-CUSTING. 
Lobster Carbonara. Overall taste was fair, sauce had binded and really became bulky whilst mid pasta twist. Snap pea pods in the dish?? Peas...Definately. Pods.....way to sweet and distinct. Service was terrible.....Terrible. There are many Italian restaurants in Arizona. This so far has been the worst for me. The other 5 diners agree too. Dismal White Clam Sauce, Bready, Heavy meatball's, Tough Raviolis. The only standout......Grilled Poundcake....It was descent."}
{"text":"A tourist trap where location may be the only thing to recommend it.   Food at a level lower than a chain Italian and service was completely absent minded. At least they comped a drink and a meal from our party of four.  Avoid as there are so many good options why waste your limited dining experience on a restaurant that has such indifferent food and service?"}
{"text":"Classy Atmosphere and easy to get in.  I love the Veal Parm; expensive, but worth it.  If you have a bunch of friends come in from out of town, take them here and then go hit the casinos afterwards.  I got really lucky at the Venetian after a meal at this restaurant.  It's good luck ;-)"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas! Great food, drinks, and deserts and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Went for a buisness dinner so they had a set family style menu with tons of food  and free drinks! The calamari they served was fantastic some of the best i have had in a lone time. The chicken marsala was also very good but so was all the main courses. Great dinner and I have always been a fan of this place. But i did have to buy one beer and 5.00 in Charlotte come on!"}
{"text":"As a Pittsburgh resident, I find it disappointing that we do not have a Carrabba's, Macaroni Grill, or Maggiano's. Therefore, whenever I'm out of town, I often try to stop at one of the three restaurants to get my Italian food fix!

I have only visited Cleveland twice for work and have been to this Maggiano's both times! Both experiences here were excellent. My more recent visit was just this past Tuesday evening. I spent some time in the mall and didn't head out to Maggiano's until close to 9pm. I was very surprised to see that the restaurant was closing in 30 minutes. I almost did not enter, feeling badly that it was so close to closing time. However, I couldn't resist and entered hoping no one would be too annoyed that I was one of the last patrons of the meeting. Despite being late, my service was very good! My waitress stopped by at least 5 times to check on me, and my food came out very quickly. I enjoyed a Bellini (needed after my long work day!) and Chicken Tortellini, which my waitress recommended. Both the drink and the entree were absolutely delicious. 

Here's hoping that I get sent back to Cleveland for work sometime soon to enjoy another dinner here!"}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago with a party of 10 to celebrate my 10 year anniversary and I believe I hit the jackpot! I made reservations with the banquet manager who was very helpful, flexible and thorough with everything.

The day of the event was great except for the fact that the actual restaurant employees, such as the hostesses were not trained to tell people that my party was to meet in the rear of the restaurant. The reply was that there was no one there and they did not know of a party... this is really bad for business and some of my guest were kept waiting 20 minutes outside.

The dinner on the other hand was fabulous! I ordered the family style dinner and the food was fresh and tasted perfect. The waiter serving our event was a gem to work with and was so polite and professional, I loved it!

We had our own music playing on the Ipod dock that was provided by the restaurant as part of the contract. Our evening was made special because everyone did a fantastic job in communicating and getting all the details accurately of what was expected.

At the end of the meal a manager cashing out our check greeting me and was very polite and professional and made my day! The meal including 3 bottles of wine, desserts to feed an army + a tip came to a little over 1,000.00 and it was well worth it.

I highly recommend Maggiano's for any private event. They did a fantastic job with mines and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you are 4 or more try the family style!! It's amazing food is great which is ALOT! and includes desert our server was very friendly and attentive, I had only visited the location in Los Angeles and they still get it right here in Las Vegas! Absolutely worth it don't bother going anywhere else!

Btw this review I had started from months ago and I just realized I never posted it. Sorry"}
{"text":"I was craving pasta for dinner after the crap I ate at Todd English's Olives, so we wandered over from the Wynn and found this place. Stuffed mushrooms were amazing! The spinach salad was really good and the lobster ravioli was good. It had big chunks of lobster in it, but the cream sauce could have been better.. still yummy though."}
{"text":"I had no idea that the best meal I would eat in Las Vegas would be at the mall of all places. We had a meal at Craftsteak and I'd trade it for the one we had here any day.

Our server was a tiny, bubbly blonde who I wish I could have put in my pocket and taken home with me. She was sweet and happy and very personable.

We ordered an appetizer of and then I had the fettuccine Alfredo while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce. 

The app was simply prepared and just lovely. My Alfredo was smooth and creamy. It was very flavorful and not oily at all. The linguine was bursting with clams. Nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top. The wine sauce was fantastic.
We also had red wine which was their special house red blend. Also excellent!

We were completely stuffed and declined dessert, but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just $2.50... I went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the cremé brûlée. They were both, of course, to die for. So good!

In the end I found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere (with lots of Frank Sinatra playing in the background) and warm, comfortable interior of the restaurant. It was just lovely.

Like I said, best meal we had the whole trip!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest & say I've only been here twice, but both times I am blown away by the amazing prices & great customer service. 

The first time I was with my boyfriend before the dinner rush, so it was pretty slow. We had said it was our first time dining & later on the manager personally brought out mozzarella cheese to welcome us. I love cheese so I was sold! Haha My boyfriend & I got Marco's Meal for Two I think it was called. You get an app, two entrees, a dessert & two more pasta entrees to take home! 

Second time was tonight. My family came during the dinner rush with a coupon they had sent my dad for his birthday. I wanted to try something new, but I was a little hesitant & the server could tell. Her name was Laura & she said if I ordered it & didn't fancy it, they could make something else for me no problem. I've never been one to send something back, but the fact that she had given me that option, really pleased me. I ended up loving it. We also all ordered a get a pasta there & take another home for $17 each. Great portions & terrific taste. You cannot beat the price!! They also brought out lemon cookies for my dad's birthday :)

When we got home to put the take home pastas in the fridge we found an extra container. Inside was a meatball, compliments of them. What a nice surprise.

My family decided tonight that we were gonna start going there more often. It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it is in a great location and if you are lucky to get a view there is a lot of people watching on the strip. We went to celebrate my Godson's 21st birthday and although they were out of tables with views and the patio couldn't accommodate our large party the manager made it happen and opened up a closed area for us to eat outside. The service is always top notch and the food is oh so good. -totally recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a nice evening on Tuesday, temperature was perfect and my husband decided that he wanted to take me out on a date and asked me what I wanted to eat so I said pasta! That's how we ended up in Maggiano's. 

For most let me say this;  I'm not a big fan of going to the strip because everything is double the price there! However Maggiano's make it worth the trip! Service is always excellent here and the ambiance is pretty cool! If you are lucky enough you can sit by the big window overlooking the strip! And that's what makes it worth the trip I think! 

Food is very cheesy! Now if you are looking for something that would make you full in 2bites this is the place for you! I can definitely eat here once every 6months but no more than that! But don't get me wrong! It's just personal preference though on my part! But I prefer their bruschetta over everything else in the menu; it's super good! And the way the textures goes together in one bite! Yum.. all of them is a must try! Sweet savory and a bit bitter from little burn of the toast is pretty amazing! 

We sat outside this time and was worried about service being a bit slow but we really had no problem! Service was pretty smooth!"}
{"text":"I am writing about a recent special birthday dinner for a group of  10 or 11.  We met at the bar and the woman who helped was sweet, quick and knowledgable. Then we moved upstairs for dinner and It all went \"downstairs\" from there:

- waitperson had a miserable attitude - seemed annoyed and/or depressed - someone from our group even talked with the nice downstairs employee, hoping to replace the helper. 

- we saw the server talking about the complaint with another employee...( they were looking our way and her body language said, \"I am so mad!\"

She continued to \"serve\" us and became ingratiatingly polite. 

Food was good,  Fried zucchini was amazing. Ambiance is corporate and reads franchise. Vibe? Busy, cute red-checkered Italian, casual, loud.   Service? A mix of professional and genuine, to hostile, to bureaucratic."}
{"text":"First time dining at Maggiano's. Thumbs up for one of the best Italian meals I have had in a long time. Our waiter was Derek and he made our dining experience enjoyable... Will be returning soon....
  I had the eggplant parm and the portion was huge took half of it home along with fettuccini Alfredo to go all for $15.00. Fresh hot rolls are awesome as well. I can't say one negative thing about our visit."}
{"text":"Restroom needed some touched up. On the way to restroom passing by bar area paper towel on the floor displayed look unsanitary. Plate for bread needed to be checked under for remains of food sticked in it. 
Presentation"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with the family and I'm giving them 4.5 stars for the service and the food.  The wait is rather long, that's why I gave it 4.5 and the food is a little pricey.  Our server was very attentive and always smiling whenever she comes to our table, making sure that we have what we need.  I ordered the Lobster carbonara.  It was very good, with lots of lobster meat (it's mostly from the claw).  They have big portions, so my daughter, my husband, and I have to bring home half of our food.  

I will go back to this restaurant because of the food and service."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in this location.  The service was a bit slower than I expected.  Perhaps, other locations have spoiled me. The food here was surprisingly mediocre.  The sauce I had was a bite bland.  The Durham location is top notch 5 star... So don't throw me under the bus."}
{"text":"I visited this place a couple of years ago on the recommendation of my friend Missy.  she loves the Newport Location, so I was willing to try it out.  

AMAZING!!!  I make it a point to east here when in vegas.  This might sound strange, but they have one of the BEST Crab Cake appetizers in the world.  I have ordered this as my main course and nibbled on my husbands food on a few occasions.  The portion size is HUGE.  We have done the Family Style meal and it was simply too much food.  We could not keep up!!!  All in all, the location is nice, the food is great and the location is convenient."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for an early weekend lunch recently. We had the entire place to ourselves for a bit around 11:30. It's attached to the Fashion Show Mall, and it seemed like most were just grabbing a quick bite in the food court instead. 

I liked the fact that our server asked if we preferred butter or olive oil and parmesan to go along with our bread. Gimme' the oil and parm, please! A pet peeve of mine is that a few select Italian restaurants in St. Louis want to up-charge for this... yes, seriously. Anywho, we carbed out on the stuff. :)

I ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni, while my husband went with the chicken parmesan. Both lunch portions were friggin' HUGE! My husband actually had two full breasts of chicken on his plate served with a large side of pasta. Four noodles came in my order, and had big chunks of chicken in every bite. We made a good dent in the dishes, but still had plenty left over. We both agreed that it was good, but it didn't compare to the good ole' authentic Italian we both love so much."}
{"text":"Went for dinner today at 4pm the place was empty, 2 of us arrived and we were not acknowledged by the waiter for 10 mins  he came over and we order drinks and water told him we were waiting on one more person she came in he walked by the table 2 times before he came over he looked at her and started to walk away we called he didn't answer he finally came back and the gentleman at another table flagged him down for us, I told him he we were talking to him and he just walked away stated I didn't hear you so he took her drink order.  He came back we ordered the food arrived and it was LACKING to say the least.  It was terrible the chicken spinach cannelloni was swimming in horrible tasting cheese there may have been 4 chunks of chicken in it, had stuffed mushrooms which were so mushy and undercooked.  When we asked this waiter what was in our drinks and the mushrooms he acted as tho it was a problem to tell us. He was  not a good waiter at all, I forget his name.  I will not return neither will the two ladies that were with me.  The food is very pricey for what you get I could've done much better at this dish!!!!  I am glad at least I had a 15.00 off coupon or I would of been even more upset.  I don't care much for Olive Garden but it is 50x better than this place.  DO NOT waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for Italian, and surprisingly, for being on the strip, they have the best prices in town!
I'm never disappointed when I come here.  The food is fantastic, the service is great, and the ambiance is grand, with views of the strip throughout most of the restaurant!
I recommend this place with two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service on New Year's Eve no less.  Food was clearly all made from scratch.  Well worth the price and ambiance was perfect.  Highly recommend.  Great for romantic dinner also."}
{"text":"We came here tonight because neither of us had ever been. We were seated immediately and served promptly. The bruschetta bar is a delight! I'd order two and take one home. Each flavor was unique and exceptional. The drinks were great, as well. Their pomegranate martini was the best I've ever had. Our server, JD, was attentive and knowledgeable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. At our table we had the bruschetta (I had the bacon and fig jam one and those with me got the standard one and the pear blue cheese) they were delicious. We had tomato soup and a side salad which were excellent. My friend got the lobster carbonerra and loved it. My other friend and I shared the chefs pasta with the veggies, turkey meatballs and white wine garlic sauce and spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was delicious and fresh tasting. Then we got the lemon cookies since it was my friend's birthday and they were light and fluffy with the perfect amount of frosting. Then to top it all off we got the dessert 5 piece sampler. The creme brûlée was perfect as was the tiramisu, the apple tart was amazing and my friend said the cheesecake was one of the best she's ever had. As for service, it was beyond excellent. Angela was always there to anticipate our every need and offer assistance. She went above and beyond. I waitressed in college, so I have high standards and she exceeded my every expectation. Great job Angela. Can't wait to come back and sample some more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Insist want to thank to all the staff! They made my wedding reception incredibly beautiful, it was only for 4 hours but we all enjoyed the  food, the service and desserts! 
Everything was delicious!! Me and my husband are very happy. We made a great decision of making our wedding reception here."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner on the strip. Cool. 

This place was SO good. We did the family style dining from the back of the menu. Highly recommend that because you can try so many different entrees. We did calamari (yum) Caesar salad (way yum) gnocchi (omg!) chicken Marsala (wow!) fettuccini (didn't try - oops) chicken parm (yummmmm) tiramisu (amazing) oh and don't forget my peach sangria. So refreshing and Dee-lish!!

I really liked this place, only negative is that it is SO crowded. Tables are smooshed together and fairly small. Other than that, so good. I hope to go back someday!!!"}
{"text":"Wait was terrible. It was Friday night after 10 pm and the place was busy. We were a party of four.  Our flatbread was cold and placed on a menu on the table, dishes not cleared, no butter or oil offered. Brought entree before salad. When we asked for more bread, he brought 2 pcs for four people  Not sure if he was mad we didn't order drinks or wine?"}
{"text":"Service was great! I recommend linguine del mare or the salmon Oscar both very very good! Mussel appetizer was awesome and you get a good amount of them! Dessert sampler was also delicious. Make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"First, the good part: waiter and manager were very receptive and friendly and tried their best to help. Also, decor and space is fine-- clean and open, what you expect from an upscale chain. 

The bad part: the salads we ordered looked like a pre-made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket. The first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken. They were very apologetic and brought out new salads. This time they came out without wilted leaves, but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time. The chicken was also overcooked, dry. Maybe I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't a $13 salad. I didn't expect anything fancy, but I do want carefully prepared and fresh food. 

We then wondered if maybe it wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but of their food suppliers--the cost of being a chain restaurant. But then we went across to the street to the Wynn and had a delicious, vibrant, salad. 

So though I appreciate Maggiano's eager and friendly service and pleasant decor, I think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food."}
{"text":"To many, Maggiano's does not qualify as \"fine-dining\" establishment, primary because it's a sort of \"chain\" restaurant, and probably becaues they occasionally offer \"deals/discounts.\"  Nonetheless, my experiences eating @ Maggianos in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas have proven that Maggiano's decor, presentation of foods, service, food taste, and overall dining experience has proven that Maggiano's is \"fine-dining\" for the regular Joe who likes good Italian food w/o having to skip out on a month's worth of eating out because of one really expensive meal :)

My experience @ Maggiano's in Vegas was actually, to a significant degree, better than my few times at the Grove location; our waiter was actually a waiter-in-training, but despite his lack of experience @ Maggiano's, he indicated he had extensive experience at other restaurants.  The first-class service he provided to us, despite his n00b status, indicated to me that Maggiano's did not hire your commonplace waiter who's only job was to write down what you wanted.  Not only was he able to describe to us in great detail the dishes we inquired about, he was also honest about what dishes he tried and would recommend.  Of course, he did press us a bit to order more than just entrees, so he was successful in getting us to order a few appetizers lol But those appetizers were all tasty and worth the price of entry (like $1-2 a person for our table of 8).  

Customizing your entree with a variety of different pastas and sauces, and withholding from certain ingredients is expected @ Maggiano's.  They will ask you how you like things and if you aren't keen on a certain ingredient, the cook will gladly make it to your liking.  This also shows that their entrees aren't \"mass produced\" and  are made-to-order (which is why food takes a bit longer than most to come out).  However, our waiter also promised us that the pasta served was made-on-site and fresh daily, thus enforcing my belief that Maggiano's is a high-caliber restaurant.

Finally, one of the best parts of my experience eating @ Maggiano's is the fact that our waiter was extremely friendly, able to hold conversations and joke around with the group, and also treat us almost like a \"valued\" and welcomed patron of the restaurant.  Yes, we were eating during lunch/daylight hrs and it wasn't too busy, but our waiter made the extra effort and it definitely showed.   

Cost for entree & appetizers shared @ the table: $16-20 out the door. For Vegas, that's a great deal for a sit-in restaurant with some amount of class and zero strippers/half naked individuals :)

I will definitely return to Maggiano's LV and hope to duplicate this prior positive dining experiences."}
{"text":"My 7 year old didn't care much for alfredo ziti (and she's not a picky eater at all). I tried linguini and clam with white sauce. It was little too salty but it was decent nonetheless with tons of clam. My mom had the shrimp scampi and thought it was decent. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional and the food was OUTSTANDING...I always try and eat here when I am in Vegas...FYI-I am a VERY picky eater yet they always have something I like and they are ALWAYS willing to make whatever I like if it is not on the menu!! Will go again when I am back in town!

PS-I booked my reservation online while I was sitting at the LV Speed Way watching drag races...such an easy, and perfect thing to do..they had my table ready and waiting for my dad and I =)"}
{"text":"I drive by this restaurant all the time and finally made reservation to eat there. I made reservation for 8:30pm this past Saturday. When we arrived we were told they are a little behind schedule on their reservations. Not a problem, we thought. Sat at the bar to have a drink while we wait. 45 minutes goes by, still waiting at the bar. Talked to a few other couples near us, and they had been waiting for over 2 hours! When asked how much longer, they say \"any time now\". I have never been to a restaurant that when I made reservations, I still had to wait 1 hour before being seated. 

Their management sucks! And is not organized at all. The bar tenders were getting pissed off because people at the bar waiting were only drinking water because the wait was so long.

Once seated, the wait staff was also slow. So either the kitchen was behind, or the wait staff was slow, but over all the service was really bad!! There were several other tables near us, that were complaining to the wait staff. So we are not the only ones that had a bad experience with this place. 

The food was pretty good. I'll try give this place one more try, maybe during the week, to see if the service is the same or if it's better. At this point I don't plan on referring anyone to this place! I really hope they get organized; I really dont see how they can stay in business."}
{"text":"We do Italian once a month for family dinner. This place seems like a chain from the outside but felt cozy and personal inside. Our server was fantastic. The food was sensational. And the chef personally brought us out a dessert when he heard it was our first time. This will be one of our go-tos."}
{"text":"Place was packed on a Sunday night - we opted to sit at a high top in the bar area. Unfortunately we were just inside the door and every time somebody went in or out we got blasted with a strong cold wind.  Service was friendly but pretty slow. The salads were huge and delicious. 

The chicken piccata was rather odd - the pasta was served in its own bowl on the side. I did my best to mix it with the chicken."}
{"text":"Good location! Right outside the Fashion Mall and on the strip! The hostess was really nice and the environment set the mood for a nice Italian dinner. Do NOT order the Alfredo with chicken. The chicken was at room temperature."}
{"text":"Terrible take out experience. We were told there would be huge portions and we were shocked by how small the \"family of 4\" package was. I wish I could show you a picture of the salad that the manager, Zach, tried to convince us was plenty big and that we would be satisfied at how large it was once we took it out of the container. Sorry, Zach, you were wrong and now we are embarrassed at how little food we bought to serve our family!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time and the food is always great. Anything with that red sauce is fantastic! I'm not even an alcohol drinker but the moscato mojitos are delicious. Bread is always  hot and fresh as well. But as far as the hostess goes they have to do better. Every time they were rude and I'm a calm patient person so I don't understand why. Such a nice restaurant in a great location don't let rude staff tarnish things. I just started using another app to make my reservations because it's always a problem with hostess. A handful of reservations and I was fed up until I found opentable app so I could interact less with the hostess. So unfortunate for such a nice place. Food is great though"}
{"text":"We were there over an hour and a half just to eat lunch.  Waitress was so slow took 20-30 between each time we seen her.  People next to us called over a manager because it took 25 minutes to just get a to go box.  I think it was more of Colette attitude that caused most of the anxiety with everyone.  She just doesn't know how to multi task.  We had other servers and manager to fill up our drinks and even to get us a bill.  However the food is always amazing.  They just need to work on training :("}
{"text":"Disappointing
We had a 5:45 reservation and were seated outside.  It was difficult to even converse because of the noise from the street below.  My wife had lasagna and she said it was very good.  I ordered angel hair primavera and the pasta was WAY over cooked.  The total bill was $78 but I was given a bill for $41.  Being the honest person I am, I brought it to the server's attention and she thanked me, but took fifteen more minutes to straighten it out while we just sat there.  Probably would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Thank you Nathan for the amazing service, conversation and food!

My husband and I decided to stop in to Maggiano's before our movie. This was our first time visiting this location and we were not disappointed. 

As we entered Maggiano's, we were greeted with a smile by two hostess. We were quickly seated and  greeted right away by our amazing server Nathan. 

Nathan was so nice and he didn't rush me when taking our order. I'm a little indecisive so it takes me awhile to decided on what I want. Especially when there are so many great options.  Nathan suggested great appetizers fried zucchini and main courses  to many to name, but I finally made my mind up. I decided on the shrimp and chicken pasta and my husband had the lamb and mushroom. (I don't remember the name)

Our food came out in a matter of minutes and it was plentiful. I didn't expect the zucchini to be so big, but they were delicious. 

I recommend skipping the appetizer, so you can save room for dessert. We tried the delicious lemon cookies they taste like a tiny moist lemon cake. They have a ton of other delicious desserts and I'm sure you want be disappointed.

Environment
Th restaurant was very clean and well lit. All the servers greeted you as you walked by and the restrooms were squeaky clean."}
{"text":"For a chain establishment the customer service at this location was excellent. We sat at the bar because the dining room was full. We had full service and the bartender Michael was superb. Not to mention his recommendation for the lobster carbonara was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place would be a B for me.
The food is great, not excellent but worth the price you pay for.
The best aspect of this restaurant is the beautiful ambiance and the big portions.

 Although i love Olive Garden, Maggianos is much more authentic Italian food. My usual entrees here are the Lasagna, the Rigatoni D, and the Calamari;] Yum Some of their entrees are good but I've realized that most the white based sauces could taste a little bland along with other pastas, but maybe it just comes down to preference.

Also while you're there take advantage of their delicious bread, we had like 3 rounds when we were there and they provide this dip that has olive oil and balsamic vinegar? not sure. But regardless if you want to eat good italian food with a nice view of the strip, you should consider going to Maggianos!

great for big groups, families, and dates:]"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there while celebrating husband's birthday. In fact we were so pleased, we returned there again a day later;). The service was superb, truly the best service we encountered anywhere in a long while. Loved the setting, the atmosphere and the food. I do have one complaint: during the dinner there was a young lady walking around with the camera, offering to take couples photo. At first my husband declined, as he felt he was underdressed, but she insisted that the photo was complimentary, and lingered around until we agreed. She returned toward the end of our dinner with a complimentary postcard as well as two large photos she wanted us to purchase for $40. When we declined, she went down in price and seemed offended we did not want to buy them, when we did not want ANY pictures to begin with. This really should not be taking place during dinner as it is in bad taste and cheapens the whole experience."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! I can not say more about it! Our waiter was good too, he was helpful in telling us about all the dining options and what was good if we liked certain foods, he kept our beverages coming and was very attentive through the whole meal. It was crowded but now we understand why! Its too bad it such a far drive because we would go more often!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this yelp review while I'm eating because it's so good. To start, the bread that was brought to my table at the start of the meal was incredibly warm and tasty. I go to a lot of Italian restaurants and this really was incredible pasta that I ordered. I ordered rigatoni a la vodka (which isn't actually on the menu) and it really was fantastic! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people. Great experience and a relatively calm atmosphere compared to a lot of the other restaurants in Vegas. I wish there was a Maggianos closer to where I am living in California!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong eating over here the food has taste the quality is fresh the service is impeccable and The View is amazing of the strip also when you're done with your meal try the desert wow unreal so tasty. The waiter Nestor is amazing. Make sure to ask for him. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love Maggiano's hated everything about the service I received today. Jose our waiter was by far the worst. He was not attentive left us waiting for long. The restaurant was not busy it was 2:30 in the afternoon. I would visit again because the food alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Again, a restaurant with excellent food spoiled by poor service.  Owners *must* send undercover relatives or friends to investigate how their staff is running *their* business as ongoing quality control. Our waiter was wonderful--knowledgeable and helpful, but a bad experience with a front of house staff who sent two of my guests away (knowing I was waiting for them and where we were sitting, and losing the restaurant money) soured my experience and I doubt that I will be back. Sadly, I could have thrown more business their way."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time eating here. Service is good but food isn't. Reheated Pasta was over cooked.  Tomato sauce was overly sweet. Wine was good though. Place was 3/4 empty during a convention. Not surprising."}
{"text":"My company got catering from here for a work party, so this review is for that, not the experience of actually eating at the restaurant itself. That said, HOLY CRAP. Easily the best catered lunch we've had, and we have about one a month. Showed up on time with an awesome all-vegetarian line-up of cheese-stuffed ravioli, bow-tie pasta, caprese salad, regular salad, delicious bread, and other goodies. (The person we were fete-ing is veg.) Food was so rich and delicious pretty much the entire company was in a food coma after 1:30. Hopefully we'll order from them again."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with menu choices, and the food was great! We were seated right away even though we ended up 30 min early for our reservation. I had the linguine with clams in the white wine sauce and my boyfriend had the scrimp scampi. His was amazing and they give you about 20 shrimp! Mine was good but I think the red sauce is probably better. It was a little bland so a lot of parmesan helped :) 

Get the dessert sampler! It's delicious! Tiramisu, apple crostada, and the cheesecake were the best. The chocolate cake was really not great and kind of dry, and our creme brulee was runny and undercooked. 

Overall good prices and good portions! $73 for 2 entrees, a dessert, and a bottle of wine. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"On a whim, my husband and I decided to try this restaurant for dinner. We had a gift card to Chili's, which is apparently part of the same chain as Maggiano's, so that made the decision easier, as this restaurant is a little out of our price range (poor newlywed life!). 

At first glance, I was sure we were completely underdressed, but the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Next time we come, however, we will dress up. :^)

The service was incredible- our server, Bryan, was attentive and friendly, offering valuable insight to the items on the menu. He was quick to keep our glasses full, and our plates as well. The food was out in record time- an impressive feat, as it was a busy Friday night. 

The food? Oh, my goodness. The FOOD! The bread & butter was warm & fragrant, & reminded my husband of genuine Italian bread. We got the mozzarella marinara, which was awe-inspiring. For our entrée we each got spaghetti, which was delightful. Our dessert was the chocolate zuccatto (so?) cake, which was decadent. 

All in all, we left VERY full, and VERY satisfied. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My best friend's birthday dinner was here and it was sooo nice! The food was delicious, I got the veggie penne pasta and I was left wanting more, except the portions are quite large, I had a hard time finishing since I went for the bread bowl as well. Luckily I'm a local and just a couple of minutes away"}
{"text":"Nice birthday dinner celebration.   Awesome place to take starving college kids.   They loved the food and the to go bags to feed them for a few days.   Everyone there was very friendly, making sure that the birthday was special."}
{"text":"With all the positive posts, I was shocked at our experience.  Restaurant was VERY crowded.  2 hour wait.  Had reservations, were seated promptly.  Small table in the back..okay..here for a \"romantic\" dinner with hubby...no problem.  Ishmel, our waiter, promptly comes over to greet.  Explains that things were crazy, did we mind taking it slow.  Cool with us.  We're here to enjoy our evening.  

Let me say that I am a foodie and an experienced Italian food person.  Have had the real thing, the American version, the fast food version, and the extremely bad version.  I know the difference.
Placed our drink order.  While we waited, received Fried Ravioli as a first time customer gift...it just was okay. Olive Garden has better.
Ishmel came back for our order.  Ordered Calamari as an appetizer, my husband ordered a Caesar Salad and Chicken Alfredo.  I asked about the Veal Marsala vs the Chef's special Beef Tenderloin.  Ishmel recommended the Veal and then house wine.  Wine was excellent.  Veal was just okay.  I have had better at Portofino's and Olive Garden.  Not the best Marsala sauce.   Caesar Salad okay.  Calamari..not as good as Lotus. Just okay.

As for taking things \"slow\"...we received our appetizer and salad together, barely got that finished when the main course came out. Had good service.  They were very crowded and busy.  Food was not up to par from previous review.  Portifinos is much better overall.  So is Olive Garden.  Will not be back.  Next  time, we'll go to Villa Antonio for quality Italian food."}
{"text":"I am very happy with Maggiano's. I had been there before and knew I would love the food, but sometimes restaurants will let you down when they have to fulfill an order larger than say 8-10. Not so here. My party was about 40 people, and the food and service was top notch. From the catering managers to the actual staff the day of, everyone was professional, accommodating, and very warm and friendly. I honestly cannot complain about a single thing. Everything I hoped for and expected was fulfilled, if not exceeded. You should definitely consider Maggiano's for a wedding reception or wedding/rehearsal dinner! You will not be let down."}
{"text":"Unpretentious, simply classy, affordable, good food. 

If you want a little Italian while in Vegas but don't want all the hoopla this is your place. It's just like the great Italian spot you and your wife always go when you're craving a delicious chicken parm.

Recommend."}
{"text":"Peach Bellini is a Yas! This is a place my girlfriends and I will go and do family style. Its perfect to choose appetizer salad entree and get a dessert. All you can eat. We each choose an entree to change it up. Only $27pp when we split."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick lunch in between shopping! Our server was kind & attentive & ensured we had everything we needed. 

We will definitely be back for the gnocchi and sausage! It was SO good!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Maggianos location, but this was my first time at this one. Easy to find and nice inside. 

When we arrived we were seated within 5 min and the staff was nice. Our server introduced himself, Eddie, and got our drink orders quickly. 

We ordered the fried cucumber appetizer which was delicious. Huge portion. My wife and I didn't finish it. 

For our entrees, I had the Grilled Chicken Salad and my wife had the chicken Parmesan. My salad was good except the croutons. I LOVE croutons but these were a disappointment. It tasted like cardboard/old frozen croutons. I tried several pieces thinking maybe the first and second were bad, but that wasn't the case. My wife's dish was yummy, but a piece of the chicken was over cooked / rubbery. 

After I told Eddie about my croutons, jokingly, he asked if I wanted a new batch. I refused as I'm not that type of customer who complains. Everything else in the salad was yummy. I think after I mentioned the dislike of the croutons he went MIA for a while before we finally got our check. 


I took a star away because of the Croutons, we didn't receive our dinner until an Hour after we got seated, and the fact that it took awhile for our check. 

This visit wouldn't stop me from going back or even having Eddie be our server again. But next time would definitely be for Brunch :)"}
{"text":"I realized i haven't yelped this place even though i have been here at least once a year since moving here.

Okay so maggiano's in my opinion is only worth it if you are going to do family style eating...heck yes all you can...

I only come here on special occasions with my family, when everyone is in town. We ordered i think almost all the combinations of food you can think of for the family style. I really love their stuffed mushrooms and calamari appetizers. Those are always a good pre-game snack, but it turns into a pre-game meal because of it being bottomless.

There are too many main courses for me to remember, but i enjoy them all especially with it being...yes all you can eat.

The dessert, get the cream puffs those are amazing monsters of joy...and i think sometimes i save half my stomach just to throw down 2-3 of those. 

I really enjoy this place for family outings because its about eating up. But really who would turn down high quality all you can eat food?? it's not a buffet so you will have to shovel out a pretty penny for the family style eating."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is the place that if my friends and I want to treat ourselves to some high quality Italian food, we make a reservation. 

We always do Family Style which is where it's at, but you have to have a party of 4 or more. So we get a good size group, pay the $35 a person, then eat until we get our money's worth, and can hardly get out of our chairs.

With family style the order includes a salad, 2 appetizers, 4 entree's, and 2 desserts. 

**HERE ARE THE MUST GETS**
Salad- Caesar Salad.
Apps- Calamari, Fried Mozzarella.
Trey trey's- Chicky Chicky parm parm, mushroom ravioli's, fettuccini Alfredo.
Zerts- New York Cheesecake, Creme Brûlée. 

In the past, my experience with the waiters and waitresses has been nice with them continuing to bring out food when asked for more with it being all you can eat Family Style and all. 
I had friends in town for Thanksgiving break who had never been to Las Vegas so I called and made a reservation for us. There was 6 of us at the table and our waitress Vanessa was really stingy and cheap with the amount of food she brought out for us. She took forever to bring out the food when we asked for more and would try and talk us out of being hungry.

I love Maggiano's, but next time I go I will make sure Vanessa is not my waitress."}
{"text":"Delicious manicotti and Rigatoni as well as dessert. The staff was so kind. Tracy, our waitress, was attentive. The chef and manager came to our table & introduced themselves. This location just started serving brunch. We'll go back for that."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot in Vegas. Not a bad seat in the house. The waiters are always very very helpful. Food is absolutely awesome! Cannot wait to eat here again. I got the moms lasagna and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on Saturday as part of our wedding anniversary date. It was my choice because we went last year and was not disappointed. Well, this anniversary was different. We made a reservation and really liked the table because it was small and in a corner so it gave us a lot of privacy. I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavalo and my husband had a Tuscan Shrimp and Chicken pasta dish (not quite sure of the name). When my food came out it looked delicious but it was very bland and the noodles tasted over cooked/mushy. My husband the chicken in his dish lacked flavor and was a bit chewy. Our waiter was friendly but at the end of the meal when he came over to ask how everything was my husband and I both kind of shrugged and said \"ehh\". Well he avoided that conversation by discontinuing eye contact and quickly asking if we wanted dessert. I could tell that he knew we were unhappy with our meals but didn't seem to want to deal with it. We decided not to say anything else and just go because we didn't want to put a damper on our date. While it wasn't the waiter's fault that the food wasn't good, he could have done a better job with trying to see what the problem was. Oh, waiters/waitresses when you ask your guests if everything is ok, please allow them time to answer instead of saying \"how is everything, good\" all in the same breath. Don't ask if you're going to answer for me. That is an issue I have at most restaurants. With all that being said, the food at Maggiano's is usually very good so I will chalk it up as one bad random experience."}
{"text":"Waiter suggested special - chicken lasagna- Alfredo sauce almost non existent but dish still good. Ordered the second special ravioli with lemon \"cream\" sauce - it arrived and the sauce was like warm milk - very watered down - sent it back and split the lasagne."}
{"text":"I had the Center-Cut Filet Mignon and as for dessert...Double Chocolate Brownie topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Strawberries! It was delish!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, prices, and great experience. Cece was an excellent server, prompt, polite and helpful. I had then Steak and Ravioli and my wife had the Chicken Alfredo. Both were awesome. Also best long Island ice tea I've ever had and the peach bellini were just as amazing. We are thrilled there is a location in Washington where we live so we can enjoy the awesome experience all over again. THANK YOU MAGGIANOS FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty angry... I was slightly ticked after our visit last night and fully intended to give Maggiano's a 2 star update. But within the last 5 minutes I went from annoyed to pissed.

Let me start from the beginning...

After a very rough Saturday with a beloved member of our family in the hospital, we were craving some comfort food, and we were in no mood to cook. We had a great experience at Maggiano's last time and we thought the extra meal they provide when you order a classic entree would be perfect the next day, since we knew we would be busy and emotionally drained.

We get there and hear there is an hour wait. Luckily we snagged a bar table and didn't have to wait. We order the overpriced drinks. They take 10 minutes to arrive. My cocktail is pretty watered down. Okay. We understand busy restaurants. Not mad... yet. We order our food. The complimentary bread still hasn't arrived. I thought my starving husband and kid were going to pass out. 

20 minutes pass. No server. 40 minutes pass. Our server approaches \"Oh, would you like some bread while you wait?\" Why, yes. Yes we would. 

Another 10 minutes pass. We get our bread. Our cold, stale tasting bread. Luckily olive oil can save even stale bread. My famished teenager ate most of it.

My husband and I both order another round.

Another 20 minutes pass. I got my wine but my husband never got his beer. 

A food runner brings out our food. No offered Parmesan or anything. My husband looks around longingly for his beer. We dig into the food. My normally not picky teenage boy said \"There's something strange about this food. Can't put my finger on it\". He still ate most of it of course. My husband's rigatoni was passable. My eggplant Parmesan on the other hand ... while I appreciate it being hand breaded and not like the formerly frozen discs that the Olive Garden serves, I was disappointed. There were three layers of eggplant. While the bottom 2 layers were warm, the top layer was room temperature. The breading itself was salty and very eggy. It tasted like the first time I attempted making eggplant Parmesan as a college student.  The one slice of mozzarella on top of this mess was not even melted. It had the texture of sliced processed cheese. The sauce was not good ... you know all that garlic that I loved in my previous review? Well, it was still there. But it tasted like stale garlic cloves that were barely cooked. It's like they threw in these awful garlic cloves 5 minutes before the sauce was done cooking. They were actually chewy. 

We finally saw our server when she rushed over and threw our to-go entrees at us. Still didn't bring the beer.

A few more minutes pass and she brings the beer and apologizes for her 20 minute delay. My husband said no thanks, that he doesn't want it. She says ok, walks away, then has the good sense to walk back and give it to him saying it's on her.

But don't feel too sorry for us ... the table next to us was seated before we were. They got their food a solid 15 minutes after we did.  

I wasn't ready to throw in the towel on Maggiano's. I just figured they had a bad night. After all, my previous visit was so awesome.

Well... after another grueling and emotional day I finally decide to put some food in my belly. Wow, that order of cheese raviolis from Maggiano's sounds pretty good right now. I reach into their fancy to-go paper bag and pull out the entrees. 2 meat lasagnas. One sausage rigatoni. Zero cheese raviolis. I really am ready to call them and scream at them... but it's after 10pm on a Sunday. If I weren't a life long vegetarian I would be tearing into those other entrees. But I'm not. Which is why I ordered cheese ravioli.

No worries. I scanned my near empty refrigerator and pantry. Found some ramen noodles and frozen costco raviolis. Score! I'm sure the Costco ravioli tastes better than their crappy ravioli any day. :("}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception here in March 2015 and we were thrilled with how everything went -- the location, the room, the food, the setup: made our special day so memorable. Everyone on the event/catering staff was a pleasure to work with and made the whole planning process a breeze. The room size and table setup was perfect, and we shipped some items ahead for place-setting decor and they did an amazing job setting everything just like we envisioned. The waitstaff was superb and the food was to die for. I want to go back and repeat. All of our guests raved about the dinner, served family-style just like in the restaurant. If you're looking for a venue for a special occasion/gathering in Las Vegas, I can't recommend Maggiano's highly enough!"}
{"text":"This is a slight update to my previous review.

The management reached out to me and wanted to remedy the birthday fiasco; I really appreciated how they actually listened and went above and beyond to not let this be such a negative experience. Being that I have a ridiculous schedule, we haven't yet went back but will definitely be back soon to actually have a family meal and give a full detailed review.

I just wanted to write this update because of the customer service experience I have received thus far; it's truly phenomenal! I wished all Management was this way, they hired an extremely professional team for the DTS location!

Yay!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a very nice restaurant. The service was excellent. The food was very appetizing. There's plenty to eat when you order a family style meal with a party of 4 or more. Will come back again. I recommend this place to everyone visiting the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Table of 9 took 3 hours.  3 hours.  3 hours.  5 children and one adult were served cold late food- not warm, but cold.  After the meals had been delivered, again, the fourth adult had to reorder their meal because it had never arrived.  When the manager was brought in, they deducted one adult meal and gave us free dessert because there were three birthdays.  I was a server for many years and I am incredibly forgiving of kitchens and servers and situations that get out of control.  This was beyond. Way beyond.  I give it two stars because I am kind. That is all."}
{"text":"Not one for chain restaurants but...this is an excellent food stop. Very busy tonight but found a table in bar area and got Laura quickly taking my order and attending. Gotta say this is really good choice. Thanks Laura for helping with special request chow item of angel hair, marinara, sausage and Pelligrino drink, and steamed mussels, which is a wonderful choice."}
{"text":"I ordered this food through doordash - so this review does not include anything about the actual restaurant. The food however, was great! I got the chicken parmigiano, and it was very well seasoned and the sauce is delicious. My husband got the alfredo which was unfortunately a little bland, but with a bit of pares an it was pretty good too. I also enjoyed the giant dessert! One thing I've got to really compliment them on though was the way they packaged the food - it was nearly perfectly packaged, with the bread appetizer included! Really enjoyed it, and hope to go there soon!"}
{"text":"The view of the strip, the service, the drinks and the food were great. It's nicely decorated.  Don't have any complains."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Pasta was way over cooked and the sauce wasn't good either. I got the angel hair and it was lumpy and the vegetables weren't cooked at all in the primavera."}
{"text":"We had Easter Sunday Brunch here. The staff is warm and friendly. We were greeted and treated politely.
The food was fantastic, I do wish they had some more fish choices less fattening but I went there knowing I would indulge :)
Maggiano's is a bonus to DTS and I will be back for sure with my whole family."}
{"text":"After years of hearing good things about this place, I really wanted to like it. We came here for a family birthday celebration. The location, service and setting are nice, but we found the food lack luster and therefore over priced. I got one of their seasonal specials and was really disappointed. Also, there is no bread brought to the table without asking and the birthday desert was a few sad cookies. They gave us coupons for a future visit, but it seems like a poor marketing plan. Invest in your customers while they are there and they will come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Easter brunch. From the food to the service to the yummy desserts. Always enjoy eating here but you can't beat this brunch as they serve all the favorites plus breakfast foods. For $39.00 it's a bargain. Will be back for sure next year."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great fresh food. The plates have just the right amount of flavor, even the \"heaviest\" dishes end up being pretty light. The prices are really good and accommodate every appetite since most plates are available in full and half size.
We spent 4 days in Vegas and had dinner at the Maggiano's twice!"}
{"text":"Maggianos Little Italy has the lowest prices, for the best quality food. Service is excellent, and it is close to a mall. We eat to-go and they don't pack the food in aluminum foil, which makes the food taste like metal unlike other restaurants. Because of this and many more things, I rate this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"My go-to place for pasta in Vegas for now on.  I drove to Vegas right after work from Cali on an empty stomach with a craving for some pasta done right.  I had Maggiano's book marked so it was the obvious choice.  Pulled into Fashion Show Mall garage, and I just happened to park right by an elevator that led directly to Maggiano's... Already winning.  Out the elevator we walked into what looked to be the alternative entrance with a sign that said go to the main host booth up front.  It was a little awkward at first walking all the way through the restaurant to get to the front but it gave us a chance to admire the place....   Loved the atmosphere and decor.
Fresh bread was good but pretty basic, slight disappointment there as I was kinda expecting something that would blow Olive Garden's breadsticks out the water.  But they did have some legit olive oil on the table.
We ordered the Chefs Special Lobster carbonara and chicken fettuccine.  The lobster carbonara... just might be the best pasta I've had.  Perfectly made creamy cheesy carbonara sauce infused with the flavors both the smoked bacon and the lobster was crazy good.
My wife's fettuccine was a huge disappointment in comparison.  It had an off taste that she nor I did not like.  Fortunately we were able to take it back, I sadly gave my wife my dish and I ordered lasagna, which was super good too, easily one of the best lasagna dishes I had.
I was also told they are willing to do custom pasta dishes where you can pick your noddles, sauces, and items in the pasta."}
{"text":"I've always found Maggiano's to be very good. I grew up with authentic Italian cooking, so I appreciate a place that does a good job, and they do. We've gone here several times. 

I love the eggplant parm, a personal favorite. The meatballs are very good. I've had the beef tenderloin medallions dish that was delicious. I've tried other dishes too. They have a \"buy one dish, take one home\" special that is a great deal with some solid choices, and for a good price. The bread is good too, and the desserts are huge and decadent.

I'd recommend trying them if you are checking them out. I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"IMHO this is decent enough Italian for a chain restaurant. However, if you have a reservation, I would advise  you to call ahead to see if they are behind on reservations and/or have a back up plan.  I made a reservation for two for 8 pm on a Friday night. When we arrived, the hostess informed me they were 15 minutes behind on reservations. By 8:30 pm, we still hadn't been seated, we asked for an update and she said we should be seated shortly. By 8:40 we had had enough. I booked on Open Table but they wouldn't allow me to schedule another reservation- I guess if the restaurant doesn't put you in the system as seated you can't make another reservation within 2 hours of the 1st. I did notice however, that Maggiano's was listing an 8:45 reservation available for a party of two. How would they seat that party if they were already running 40 minutes behind on the 8 pm reservations?  So I CALLED a nearby restaurant, asked about availability, they stated they had tables open, notified the hostess at Maggiano's  that we were cancelling and we left.

IMHO.the food is okay but it is NOT  worth waiting over 40 minutes for, especially when you have a reservation- I am not sure ANY  restaurant is worth waiting 40 minutes for. I don't know how they manage their reservations system but it seemed that they overbooked and should not have continued to accept reservations."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting a Maggianos location, first time on the strip. Great atmosphere, view, and location. Food was pretty good and filling as well."}
{"text":"Late post..but Amazing food and service. Dustin or his name might of been Devon.. (Sorry I'm bad with names but My bf would know since he automatically remembered his name) because he was very efficient knowledgeable and quick to get us what we wanted especially with how busy it was.. We both are servers so we have our expectations but are also compassionate and very understanding if something goes wrong or takes too long ..but there was nothing wrong! Also try their amazing 2 for 43$ deal its two pastas two side dishes one delicious dessert . and Freakin two pastas to take home ! So crazy so many left overs..but its good if u have a large family or friends who would like to try out some dishes when u get home"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and I love the family style dinning!  The stuffed mushrooms and the alfredo sauce is so AMAZING also the cheesecake is not too shabby either!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here tonight for our family birthday dinner. This is a beautiful restaurant it's nice and clean and inviting. We had our dinner served family style first we started with a nice Caesar salad and some calamari, then we had grilled salmon lasagna shrimp scampi and chicken marsala the salmon and the chicken marsala were delicious.We then had to of course have birthday cake, we had the chocolate layer cake, cream brulee and apple strudel with vanilla ice cream all delicious. The manager Amanda was delightful and our waitress was a tentative, we all had a great time and left with our bellies full and plenty of food to take home."}
{"text":"Food was yummy as always.... Love the chopped salad!!!!  Then gotta get mushroom ravioli. It was delicious. Save room for the chocolate cake because it is to die for yummy. I've tried to recreate it but can't get it right.   


Our service wasn't the greatest but it was still decent. 

Thus meal was one of the better meals we had this weekend plans s it was cheaper than a few carry out type meals.... Crazy!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a Maggianos off the strip that gives you a Togo take home meal. I usually get the spaghetti and giant meatball with extra sauce. Very filling and always delicious. The service the 4 times I've been has always been top notch and very attentive."}
{"text":"WOW! What happened to this place? Worst service I have ever had at Maggiano's! My party had to grab the attention of our server on several occasions, such as to refill our empty glasses of water. Everything came out all at once. So our table had no room for our appetizers, cold bread, and our meals. Oh and we had no dinner ware. I guess they expected us to eat with our hands. Why not? We were being treated like barbarians, so why not eat like one! So once again, we had to flag someone for dinnerware, since our server disappeared on us. The menu had changed drastically since we were here last. I think we would have had a better deal ordering Italian from Pizza Hut...and probably received better service! Am I being too harsh? Not after spending all that money on what is supposedly \"upscale\" Italian. Granted they seemed to have two very large events going on, but that is no excuse for providing us with lack luster food and service. I am taking Maggiano's off my list of places to bring family and friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Ok, so the first time I went, I was so satisfied! Ordered the dinner for 2 special with gift pasta to go... great idea! The appetizer of this shrimp fondue was amazing. So, after the great first impression, I was excited to return. And I did. The food was awful! Everything seemed prepared hours in advance...not fresh and overly salty. The waiter even advised us against one of the dishes saying it was salty. However, I decided to return again... hoping it was just a bad night. It wasn't. My boyfriend and I said that unless it is free, we will not return. I am sad, because I thought it would be my new favorite place...."}
{"text":"The Bartender was rude and if I wasn't with my family I would have thrown my drink in his face.
Actually I wanted to do a lot more, but i figured a true review would hurt them most.  DONT GO!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best in town.   Everything made from scratch   Can tell the quality for sure. Authentic. Linguine and clams. Off the charts!!!  Salads good    Our first time chefs made some appetizers for us to try complimentary . Great service good prices."}
{"text":"There is no other Italian place (in my opinion) in Las Vegas.  I have been coming here for years every time I come to Vegas.  The only way to do it is family style - you get so much food, and they take such good care of you.  The only problem I have is I eat to much - every time I go and the rest of the night is miserable ... I never learn!! hahah"}
{"text":"I have been to Maggiano's many, many times and have enjoyed their salads, desserts, fried calamari, fried zucchini, linguini with clams and shrimp pasta.  They were all excellent!!!  However, I just tried the lobster carbonara $27.95, based on all the pictures and recommendations here on Yelp and I was SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED!!  My dish had HARDLY ANY LOBSTER!!!  There were minuscule pieces here and there and that was it!!  The dish was mostly bacon and peas.  The peas were good but I was looking for the lobster - where was the lobster I have seen in the Yelp photos??  Was I just there on a bad day where the cook said forget it, no lobster for you?!!  Cumulatively I don't think there was an inch of lobster in the whole dish.  Seriously, I would NEVER order this dish again.  I'll be back for the other items though, but this was a $27 mistake!

Oh yeah, service is always great, but minus one star for the forgettable lobster pasta dish.  Order the clams or the shrimp!  It's still my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas, though."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had visited a Maggiano's location.  I saw an ad on Facebook for $2 mimosas for Sunday Brunch in the month of February - so we decided to check it out.  WOW - we loved it!  The food was delicious!  We had a few mimosas, Bloody Marys ($5 each), and shared the lemon ricotta pancakes.  We also ordered the Chicken Benedict and the vegetable frittata.  All items that we would definitely order again.  Service was great - Deven was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Came here after waiting 10 minutes at a different restaurant in Fashion Show with no service...  What a great decision!  Loved Maggiano's...  Food and Beverage was outstanding and the service was SO on point!  Our Server continually checked on us to be sure everything was good.  We ordered two (2) Martinis each, Risotto Bites, Filet Mignon, and the Chicken Salad.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Disappointed is the best way to sum up my first visit. Order not ready when promised. Eggplant Parmesan was by far the worst I've ever tried. Missing ingredients like cheese is a big problem for those of us who love Italian food. Portions were extremely small for the money. Pasta was dry. Honestly not many good things to say about this experience."}
{"text":"Maggiano's Little Italy is on the second floor of the Fashion Show Mall, across from the Wynn and Treasure Island on Las Vegas Blvd. 

Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in over 20 states. I have eaten at the one in Minneapolis as well as this one. I guess in the hiearchy of Italian food Chain restaurants it goes something like this:

Out of the can and not Italian: Chef Boyardee
Slightly better Casual not Italian: Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill
A little better if you didn't know better: Pasta Pomodoro 
Mid-level trying to fool you as high-end Italian: Maggiano's and Buca de Beppo
Higher prices and more Northern Italian: Il Forniao
Really great Italian: don't tend to be chain restaurants 

Maggiano's has nice ambiance, expensive dark wood decor, and is usually very popular and crowded. In Vegas expect to wait even with a reservation. We had a party of 10, called at 5 and couldn't get reservation until 8:30. Maggiano's is perfect for large parties, as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared (most have a half size option, so take it!) They offer a family style approach special menu for large groups, where the cost is $29.95 per person, and includes 2 shared appetizers, 2 pastas, and 2 mains in a bottomless approach. They encourage this, as they will tell you if you order a la carte, it may take 30 - 45 minutes (for Pasta?). we went a la carte because some didn;t want to comprimise into limited selections. 

The Mozzarella Buffula appetizer (what they called Tomato Slice and Mozzarella, or something like that) is one of my favorite Italian appetizers. The special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination, Maggiano's shreds the basil, which I prefer the fresh whole leaf. You get 3 slices with an order. 

The Capellini d'arrabiata (which they call by the English name of Angel Hair) comes in a huge bowl with about 1/2 to 1 pound of pasta, roma tomatoes, garlic and a little oil, with some basil, and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce. They have a couple of lasagna offerings, either covered in a bolognese (ground beef) sauce or in a Marinara. It is huge, like everything is. There is a large menu of good selections for most people. 

They don't offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread, but if you ask for it, they will bring it to you. 

If you want A LOT of food and willing to pay over $30 per person for Pasta, go here."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is consistently above average and this outpost in the Fashion Show Mall is no exception. The waitstaff was very attentive. We were also able to take advantage of their buy one pasta dish take one home offer. What a great value!  Thanks FourSquare :)"}
{"text":"Food was very good. My husband and I split an appetizer as well as a pasta dish and ordered a pitcher of Sangria. Total came out to about $75 with tip included. We were sat by the window with a great view of the strip and Wynn hotel. Since we are locals, they treated us to a little plate of lemon cookies. That was a nice touch. Ambience was great. We even were serenaded with a short \"love\" song by their guitar player. We had a great date night out."}
{"text":"The most amazing experience here! It started off questionable. I called prior to arrival to reserve a window table for lunch. I was told I do not need a reservation because there are plenty of window tables available. Happy to hear that, we arrived 30 minutes later and... there were no window tables available. When pointing out the information I received over the phone, the hostess seemed pretty annoyed but ended up accommodating us contingent on a 15 min wait. A small yet unnecessary bump in the road after which our server took over and won us over with incredibly attentive and accommodating service. Beverly went above and beyond even presenting sweet surprises, as we were here after celebrating something very special. 
As far as the food, he bruschetta was incredible! I can have like 10 instead of an entree. However, I did enjoy the lobster pasta recommended by Beverly.
Maggiano's is a solid restaurant, the hostesses can afford to take a lesson from Beverly. Honestly, I considered leaving while dealing with hostesses attitude. Hunger and drive to the strip kept me from doing so, I'm glad I stayed!"}
{"text":"Dined on Tuesday, 3/29/16. We had a reservation for 7:30 pm, and like others, a reservation meant NOTHING. We were seated at 7.50 pm. When I complained to the hostess that they weren't close to honoring the reservation and we had tired and hungry kids, she called for a manager, who never came. 

We were seated in the back, with a sassy waitress, in the land where they didn't bus the tables that people left. It's really nice to look at someone else's leftover mess for 45 minutes.

In addition, the 4 water classes on our table were dirty. We asked for new ones and they, too, were dirty. Like, dirty chunks of food on the outside (we hope) of the glasses. You couldn't NOT KNOW they were there. We were afraid to use them. Luckily, the kids got plastic cups. 

Food was fine. Waitress got the additional to-go order wrong. 

They are lucky to be in business. There are plenty of restaurants in Scottsdale. No one needs this."}
{"text":"Maybe my visit was a bit different this time since I made a reservation and didn't have to fight to get in.  We ate their for lunch and all of our entrees were delicious.  We enjoyed the Calamari, Stuffed Mushroom, Maggiano's Salad, Chicken PIcatta, Ravioli del Forno and Spaghetti.  We loved the whole take home portions they offer with their pastas.  The server was fabulous."}
{"text":"this was my first visit to magganios.  and let me tell you i can still taste my dinner.  you know that one episode of friends where Joey keeps insisting to the waiter that he wants \"lobster ravioli\"?  well in my case i will probably always be shouting \"chicken and truffle tortellini!\"  I  don't have words to describe its creamy and fulfilling texture and deliciousness.  AMAZING.  I just remember taking huge pieces of bread and making sure i got every single little drop of sauce.  And if  I wasn'y in public i might have licked the plate clean!  The portions are huge and fulfilling.  And well they are very attentive to your every need this time my water glass was always full and never empty.  I just found out theres on in  san jose i cant wait to try that one!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday here with brunch on Sunday, November, 20. 
We were greeted and immediately seated by a pleasant hostess. 
My Ziti was excellent and the chef sent home a gift of Lasagna. 
My wife had the Lighter Take Fettuccini Alfredo. She loved it and got the Beef Pappardelle as a gift. Both were also excellent. 
Our guests had the Eggplant Parmesan and the Lighter Take Fettuccini. They were also very pleased with the quality and portion size. 
One of the things that was evident is that the food is fresh and homemade per portion. How refreshing!
Our server brought Vera's Lemon Cookies as a birthday surprise. Probably the best lemon cookies ever!
I also had the Creme Brûlée. A HUGE portion that was obviously homemade, very creamy, and had the perfect crust on top. 
This was an excellent meal, professionally served. We felt very satisfied that we had made the right choice and will return again when we go back to the Red Rock."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but they serve the same things that you can get at Macaroni Grill. The only catch? You have to wait half the afternoon to get your food. My wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered penne rustica and I think we waited at least (and I mean at the very least) an hour to get the food. I understand everything is supposed to be fresh, but I wasn't impressed. The same dish at Macaroni Grill tastes better and comes faster. I also like the bread more at Macaroni Grill.

We ordered the bruschetta, and it was good, and the meal was good. The portion sizes were much larger, but given the price and the time factor I wouldn't return unless we had another gift card.

My wife claims that other Maggiano restaurants are better (i.e., Las Vegas), but I can't confirm or deny that.

She got a free extra serving of hers because she got a pasta dish, which was really the one shining moment here."}
{"text":"I am a repeat regular at this restaurant I made reservations about 6 days ago. This is my first review of this restaurant. The wine is good food is fantastic but it took our server 13 minutes to greet my girlfriend and I I requested a table by the window of Las Vehas Blvd since its Valentine's Day and I get sat in the back of the restaurant.... And yes I did request to be sat there on my reservations. Service could use some work. Also took my server about 15 minutes to just bring our drinks and the bread was cold... Other experience's were great but not this one... Also waited on our food for 30 minutes and other people who got here after us were getting their food before us."}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughters first birthday here in a private room with our family and friends. The ladies who helped me organize this were amazing! They even made sure that everything turned out well the way we wanted after the party. The wait staff were excellent. We got to meet the chef and his crew. They provided great food and made sure that no one was out of food or beverages. This is definitely a great place to host a party."}
{"text":"I went to Maggiano's last Friday for a gluttonous feast.  Why gluttonous?  The portions are almost comically large and the nutritional content of the menu items isn't posted on their website.  I try to avoid chain restaurants that don't post calorie counts, but my boyfriend really wanted to go there.  I had the eggplant Parmesan.  The portion really was as big as my head.  But it was delicious.  I've had this dish there many times and it has always been really good.  My boyfriend had the gnocchi.  Another one of my meatless faves.  His portion was also really large, and despite the heaviness of the dish, he was able to eat the whole thing.  Our waitress and the service we received was just OK.  It took awhile to get drinks and we weren't asked if we wanted dessert.  Although the food was good, I think I'd rather support a local Italian restaurant instead of a chain.  However, if you're dining with a large group, the family style meals are a good way to go.  I've gone with work groups before and this has been a good way for everyone to get more than enough food at a fixed price."}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion Show Mall on The Famous Las Vegas Strip. Ok so let me start with this, and it's admittedly a personal bias, I don't really like pasta, I mean it's boiled dough for gosh sakes. Also I don't like to order chicken at a restaurant unless it comes in a bucket. That being said there wasn't a whole lot for me here, but I will say that everything is prepared with care and the service was good. If you like pasta go for it, if not there are plenty of other choices it is Las Vegas after all. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"For a higher end restaurant, just ok. Nothing special. Ambiance is like a pizza joint. People are packed in like sardines. Average flavors with nothing to inspire a return trip."}
{"text":"Nice location with great Strip views, great service, the food though left us with mixed feelings: the stuffed mushrooms appetizer was great, although the portion could be more generous, the Fettuccini Alfredo was good, and the Eggplant Parmesan was disappointing (too much marinara, acidic tasting, lukewarm). The highlight of the dinner was the dessert: one of the best Tiramisus we've had."}
{"text":"Had my boyfriend bring me a to go spaghetti with meat sauce and meatball and this is what came home. Where's the sauce????? I'm horribly disgusted. Then they sent a $10 gift card. That doesn't even cover the meal. Never going back."}
{"text":"Came here for my 21st birthday dinner and had an awful experience. The service was just awful. Our waiter, Brandon, was rude and made the whole experience just bad. It was 105 degrees out so we were expecting to come into a well air conditioned restaurant. It was kind of warm in the restaurant but it was fine. However they sat us into a booth in a corner and it was so hot because it was enclosed by walls and there was no air flow. As a result I asked if we could move tables to a cooler spot in a more open area of the restaurant. Instead of accommodating us, our waiter told us that we could stand up and walk around the restaurant to see if there is a cooler spot and then he told us we could move if we find a cooler area. We knew it was cooler in the other sections of the restaurant. He seemed very annoyed about the whole situation so we just stayed put. We ordered and got our food. The food was good. However our waiter checked up on us maybe twice and he just seemed annoyed the whole time. He knew it was my birthday because he checked my id and I was expecting a birthday dessert. But he just dropped off the check and left. The whole service was just awful and we got the vibe that we weren't wanted there and we just felt rushed  the restaurant wasn't even busy. 


Never coming back here again. It was just a bad vibe and I did not enjoy the service at all. 

I got better service at a Dennys."}
{"text":"The ambiance was my favorite part.  We made reservations around 6:30 pm on Saturday.  The earliest seating was at 9:15 pm.  We arrived at the fashion show mall, parked, and wondered our way out front to the entrance of Maggiano's.  I always love the atmosphere in these kind of places.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food, so don't read too much into my comments about the food.  The Calamari Fritte was a bit greasy with too much oil, but was overall pretty good.  The marinara dipping sauce was superb.  We also had stuffed mushrooms, which were really good.  They were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce.  My fiance and I shared a bowl of Linguine di Mare.  It had lobster, shrimp, clams, & mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth.  It was pretty good.  Lots of meat.  Very filling.  A man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic Italian song.  Simply romantic.  We had nice seats facing Las Vegas Boulevard.  We lingered a while after paying the bill, but the server stopped refilling our water.  This bothered me a little.  I was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough.  The bill was almost $60.  We had to take an alternate route back to the car because The Fashion Show Mall was closed.  I enjoyed this experience and would go again, but would prefer some place else because I'm not a big fan of Italian food."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, they did a damn good job. Bread to start was perfect, ceasar salad was great, spaghetti and meatballs was as good as you can get, and the lemon chicken dish was the best part. So good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before seeing The Beatles Love. We've dined here a couple of times before. We made a reservation and when we checked in, it still took 20mins to seat us. We noted that we were not celebrating anything, just having a date night. We had four people ask us if we were. It was starting to get annoying! I had the mushroom ravioli. It was extremely salty and I had a hard time trying to eat it. My husband had the steak with asparagus risotto. He asked for it medium rare and it came our almost well done. At this point we were running late for our show and just wanted to eat and leave since we were walking to the mirage. I doubt we will be returning to this location. Hopefully the downtown summerlin location will provide a better experience."}
{"text":"Customer service has been on a steady decline over the years. Used to be a good place, but now they've lost their efficiency. The past couple times my family has been here we have been subject to poor management. 

-Out of clean wine glasses so they didn't serve wine. Cleaning took over 30 min apparently. 
- Apps and Desserts both took over 30 min to come to table. One App didnt come until the entrees. 
- Waited 20 min for a table even though we had a reservation. 
- Server messed up split bill

I wont be coming anymore. It's too pricey for a poor experience."}
{"text":"Terrible experience on New Years Eve.Onion soup and eggplant were not good at all. The real disappointment was the poor service. Had to ask 4 times to refill our drinks. Got them refilled when the bill was handed to us. They never cleared our table, from the appetizers to the end, all dishes, water glasses and drink glasses were left on the table, 2 1/2 hours! Then we see a \"host\" walking around with little gift bags, giving them to only people who were there for the first time, hahaha. How about the customers who come all the time, hahaha. Will never go back. Far too many better establishments."}
{"text":"I love Maggiano's on Sunday afternoon......why?  Because it seems that this is the only time that there is any space at all in this huge place.  

I usually stick with the basic lasagna meal because it is a house special (eat one in - take another pasta home for lunch - all for one low price). But it is the appetizer that is over the top.  Fried Zucchini - not greasy zucchini, not small zucchini, we are talking big, huge long fried strips \"of zucchini hand battered with Japanese bread crumbs, fried to a golden brown, served with a zesty lemon aioli cream sauce.\"  This is worth the trip itself.

So, the atmosphere is open, has a large seating area, and many private rooms available for private parties.  It also features ample outdoor seating, and since it is currently winter and cold, they offer large patio heaters.

The staff is friendly, usually prompt with your request, and very helpful in suggestions.

I would recommend this location, but do yourself a favor and make reservations, walk-ins will surely wait awhile or be like me, visit on a nice Sunday afternoon.

{"text":"The food was really good, the pasta was cooked perfectly. The meatballs could have been a little more tender. 
The best part was the vanilla ice cream. Is that bad? It is a great Italian place, but I really liked the ice cream. Oh, and the fried zucchini was fabulous."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered yet but the server JOSE on patio tonight hates his job, his guests, and the fact that he enjoys bullying us out of the closed patio is disgusting. He blames having to pick up his kids on our experience we're trying to pay for. Sad to see inconsistency lives strong in Vegas. Mind you we came from summerlin to eat here. Can't wait for summerlin location to open!! We can cheapen the experience much closer to home."}
{"text":"Great food you won't find better priced food in Vegas great value. Our waiter Fred was great we come every time we are here."}
{"text":"Created an account just for Maggiano's!!!

Went to Vegas for my 21st and someone had recommended Maggiano's...so I thought, why not?? Our mistake for not making reservations cuz the wait time was 40 mins. No big though cuz we were in the mall.

When we got seated, we started off with the flat bread with sausage - sooo delicious! Thinking about the dish makes my mouth water. Since I didn't know what to choose for the main course, I asked the waiter for advice and he was insightful. The garlic shrimp pasta turned out to be delicious, especially the savory shrimps! Also, the lobster dishes (ravioli and carbonara) which my friend and boyfriend ordered were cooked perfectly.

In terms of Italian food, I give Maggiano's a 5! This is no ordinary Italian food you get any day.

Great food, classy atmosphere, reasonable prices, and generous portions! What's not to love??? Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas! AND making reservations to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Great family priced meal for a large group. Came here to celebrate a birthday and we
Enjoyed. Only disappointing was the gnocchi. Waiter was excellent and the desserts were very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've had some pretty bad service in this town but this was terrible! First I waited ten minutes for a table that was already open when I put my name down. Then the hostess seats us and walks away. I grabbed my own menu, got my own balsamic because my server was no where to be found. Ordered a second glass of wine and never received it.I can't rememeber the servers name but sweetie if someone orders a $14.00 glass of wine at lunch rememeber to bring the other one. Guess your tips were just that good today that you didn't need that money. This happened a few weeks agao but I was at the fashion show mall today and opted to eat at the food court instaed of having another $80.00 lunch at your restaurant. That's right, id rather eat sbarro than deal with awful service. The food however was amazing! Kudos to your chef, maybe you should bring him to the FOH!"}
{"text":"Solid dinner experience. Separate entrance so you can valet and be in the restaurant without walking through the casino if you like. Sat at the bar while we waited for a table.... this is a popular spot. I'd recommend reservations if going on a Sat night like we were. The bartenders were friendly and prompt without being intrusive. The Blackberry Bourbon Sour was what I ordered, only $11 and was a great cocktail.

Pretty view of the Wynn from the window table at which we were seated. The bruschetta bar was fun--totally gets you to try something fun and new for like $2-3 and the portion is big enough that you and your date can each have a bite or two. Also, Eat the table side bread quickly--super yum when it's still hot!  

Our server, Jaden, was friendly and extremely amenable to tweaking the ingredients to any dish if we had a food allergy--something that's tricky at many restaurants. He also knew the menu well and was able to provide insight into specific dishes.  I got the lobster carbonara and my friend got the chicken Romano. Both tasty and portions were huge! We could have split one and likely still had leftovers! Btw for picky eaters, they have things on the menu like spaghetti and fettuccini in addition to some more interesting dishes too and salads. They also tweak some of the pasta dishes to make it a 'lighter fare' option. 

For such a big restaurant and its location on the strip, I thought the team here did great work, the prices were reasonable, and the quality was there."}
{"text":"I went here after work with my boyfriend.  We both like Italian but we thought it would be more on the expensive side. We took a chance and drove out there from Cleveland.  I ordered chicken parm and he ordered beef medallions with garlic mashed potatoes.  Both of our meals were delish and not that expensive.  Our server was great and the atmosphere was nice. We will make this a restaurant we will go back to."}
{"text":"First time writing a review, but this place blew me away! Was expecting this place to be extremely expensive like a nice steak house or $30+ for a plate. The inside is rather nice and upscale, much better than any Olive Garden and for cheaper or about the same price depending on what you order. They have a 2 for $42 special where you can select from a variety of options which all looked rather delicious. The special includes an appetizer/starter or 2 select salads. My girlfriend and myself selected the calamari which was delicious and a rather larger portion. We went with two upcharged dishes for a couple bucks more and were pleased with the quality and quantity of the food! I selected the Famous Rigatoni \"D\" which has very juicy chicken and the pasta was delicious as well. My girlfriend selected the chicken Francese which was a recommendation by the waiter, Johnny. We both loved our meals. We finished the dinner with desert which was the chocolate cake. I forgot the name but it was 6 layers of chocolate cake and chocolate mousse which was also very large as well served with chocolate and caramel drizzle on the plate! In the deal you also get 2 take home plates which were large as well! 

The service was also phenomenal. Our waiter was Johnny who took very great care of my girlfriend and myself informing us of the menu and taking care of us during our meal. The chef also brought us each a piece of bruschetta since it was our first time in the restaurant which was also very delicious! Johnny also informed us that if we had any allergies the chef would personally come and ask us about how to have our dishes served if needed! Overall 5/5 stars! Great service! Great food! Great dining area! Great experience! Thank you Johnny!"}
{"text":"We took my son here for dinner on his birthday. Long before that night, I had requested in the Open Table reservation one of the coveted booths in the middle of the floor on the first level. When someone called to confirm the reservation the day before, they assured me they had one of those booths reserved for us. When I checked in (early and we had a drink at the bar), I was again told we would get one of those booths. Once we were called to be seated 10 minutes late, she started leading us to the back of the restaurant? As we passed the last booth where we wanted to sit, I saw the tab on their table and asked if they were leaving soon. They said they were only waiting to pay their bill. So we went back to the front to wait. My fiancée needed to leave within the hour to be at work. We waited and saw the couple still seated at the booth, so I walked over and they were still waiting for their payment to be processed. I told the Manager that by now, we needed to leave in 40 minutes.  So we were finally seated, and my son said he was embarrassed that I was assertive about wanting to sit where I requested, and refused to order a meal. It was a very upsetting evening, and I barely touched my food. The waitress was awesome in trying to handle the \"situation\" and helped make it a little more bearable by getting our food to us right away, bringing the lemon cookies with sparkler for the birthday before we had to leave, and took care of our tab promptly. It was a horrible experience on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour and the house wine was easy to drink and super cheap. We really enjoyed the crab cakes, but the chicken flatbread wasn't anything special and was a lot larger than we had expected. We ended up splitting the seared pork medallions for our actual meal and it was really good! We thought they would be thick and shaped as a medallion (round and thick), but they looked more like a flattened chicken breast. Learn something new every day! Regardless, they were delicious, especially when combined with the bread dipped in the sauce accompanying the pork. We saw a giant slice of chocolate cake appear on the table next to us and it looked so tempting. Too bad we didn't have any more room!

Only complaint was that my husband's gin and tonic had no gin, which we sent back. The waitress brought him a new one and explained that they do shorter pours during happy hour. He took one sip of the second one, thought about it, then said to screw the happy hour price, he'll pay full price for a real pour. When the waitress (who was really sweet) brought it back to the bartender, we could hear him exclaim \"REALLY?!\" from our seat across the lounge."}
{"text":"Ok, as far as Italian goes this place is pretty decent.  The big pull for here is the amazing value.

Buy one of any of the classic dishes and take home another classic dish for later all for the single dish price.  The food is basic but tasty and it reheats well.

Nothing crazy special here but if you're in the area anyways check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"They mailed my mom a birthday coupon, so we went as a family, baby and all. The wait was long and it was hot, but we opted to sit in the outdoor seating area to avoid waiting (underneath the escalator, without misting system as it was out). The view across the Strip looking at Wynn's lush landscaping was kinda nice. The ads playing on loop on the Wynn billboard also kept me entertained. There were a couple of memorable ambulance runs down the Strip, as I felt compelled to to pressed my hands to the baby's ears to protect her eardrums. 

Not much to say about the food, it's Maggiano's. I remember liking the one in Houston better but I think it depends on what you get and I was not particularly impressed with the dishes we got that night. I think next time they mail in a coupon, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. 

The mussels appetizer was delicious and plentiful.  My wife's

My only complaint would be the Linguine d'mare was not as bold as I have had in other nice Italian restaurants.  But it was loaded with seafood!

My wife loved her ravioli and take home box of the same!

Delicious coffee after cheesecake was perfect."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit @ Maggiano's little Italy . Friendly staff , and amazing food 
Everything was so delish. Had the manicotti huge portion , my partner had The shrimp diablo he just loves spicey . House red wine was not a bad choice went well with our entrees . Of course the Italian bread did it for me 
This place is a must try .  You'll never go back to Olive Garden if only for the soup n salad"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Maggiano's in such a long time. I happened to be doing a little shopping over the weekend, so a friend and I decided to grab a quick bite. 

The greeters were super friendly and funny...I always appreciate a little humor. People in the service industry on the strip can get so jaded dealing with tourists. 

Reservations were not needed during off peak hours. We came here around like 2 pm, and we were seated immediately.

We ordered the fried zucchini, ravioli, and Maggiano's salad.

HOLY MOTHER OF **** the fried zucchini is amazing. I don't know where they are buying their zucchini, but the pieces were gigantic and barely fit on the serving platter (let's try not to think about GMO's for the moment). And my goodness, the tangy creaming sauce they bring with it...so good! I could've eaten ONLY this. 

Maggiano's salad was a spectacular burst of flavor. I normally hate blue cheese, but it was nicely tossed throughout the salad with crispy pieces of prosciutto. The prosciutto was a little overcooked, but that was really my only complaint. 

Our waiter was prompt, but unfriendly. I don't think I saw a smile the entire time. In fact, he seemed a little annoyed we were lavishing in our \"girly time.\" He could stand to take a couple notes from the greeting staff at the door, they were so nice!"}
{"text":"I love Maggianos so much that I couldn't wait to get home to write this.

Specifically I really enjoyed this Maggianos on its first day of grand opening. Not sure if it's bc the service was superb-- shout out to Jenna!-- given their President Steven was walking around, greeting customers and bussing plates! I always learned through business school.. and even that show on CBS that a good CEO understands even what the lowest employee endures and experiences. Regardless, there wAs lots of staff on hand tonifht and nothing went awry.

To start from the end-- almost everyone walks out of that restaurant with a doggie bag in hand. Why? Because when you order a certain meal special you get a take home order of their classic pastas. Yes that's right.. dinner.. lunch.. and dinner again! 

Maggianos is my go to Italian if I'm not in Little Italy NYC. Family style is nuts. Definitely a great way to celebrate a meal with the family. 

Our favorites are the gnocchi and sausage, chicken piccata, and the lasagna. Dessert is never to be missed! 

I can't wait to come here monthly. Oh how large I will become..."}
{"text":"First off, kudos for having a server like Beni!

Had a feeling this restaurant was going to be better than expected from other people in the know, it's better than most Italian Chain restaurants. 

The apps for happy hour was good (Italian chicken flatbread)
The Mozzarella, tasty!

The entrees were good, Lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, braised beef. All good!

The dessert (cheesecake) very good!

Plus certain entrees you get a \"gift\" from the chef, 
ANOTHER pasta to go!

Great first time experience, great service from Beni!

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  We called a month in advance to make Thanksgiving reservations.  We flew in from Philly and flew my brother in...for his birthday....from L.A.  When we got to Vegas, we called to move the reservation an hour and a half later.    No problem, the girl told us...and she confirmed they knew we were celebrating a birthday AND Thanksgiving.  We arrived only to learn they had closed at 8, one hour BEFORE we were supposed to be there.  I confirmed the time I had called, and they confirmed that a note was in our reservation.  Nevertheless, although the restaurant was PACKED, they refused to seat us. They offered a weak apology...not even a free drink....and our Thanksgiving was ruined.  Terrible, terrible customer service."}
{"text":"First time at the location, originally from Southern Ca this is the best as it gets. Classy atmosphere and very good food. Service is phenomenal and I recommend to sign up for their email list through Yelp prior to your visit and receive $10 off your next order."}
{"text":"Huge menu and all the solid Italian dishes!!  The baked pastas are excellent and the veal dishes are great!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a lunch if you're in Fashion Show and don't want standard food-court food."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place.   The spaghetti and meat sauce was done perfectly.  They have perfected the art of cooking pasta where it's not over cooked and soggy or too crunchy or hard. It's fine the way it should be.   Bread is amazing.  The linguini and clams was also excellent.   The ambiance is a bit strange because the tables were very close and we sat by bar with various televisions.  But focusing on food only, it was excellent."}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you eat at chain like Maggiano's. Pretty good food. Really big portions. Fair prices. The place is much more focused on family style dining (including a pretty generous \"family style\" menu), so it's probably best to eat at Maggiano's with a big group. 

Maggiano's has a nice set up. The ambiance is cool. If you have a choice between the ground floor or going upstairs, I recommend staying on the lower level. There's only one stairwell, without a lot of room, so employees carry hot plates of food are running up and down while you try to stay out of their way. It also forces them to bring up only part of your table's order at time, meaning that some food was on the table, while the rest of the party waits another couple of minutes for theirs. I'm sure it's too late now, but it probably would've been a good decision to build a back stairwell or install some sort of old school dumbwaiter. 

Other than waiting a little longer than we should have for some of the food to come out, the service was great. Our waitress was funny and engaging. She had a few lines that made me laugh and seemed to have a lot of \"I just served someone who...\" stories. When I was called in the morning to confirm our reservation, I informed the caller that we were there for a couple of birthdays. They left a little Happy birthday card on the table, and brought us some lemon cookies (with candles) for dessert. A nice little touch. 

Yes, there are a lot of better Italian spots in the valley. But there's nothing wrong with the food at Maggiano's. A solid place to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here sooner!?!  Before going here the other day, I had only had their food at a friend's party (they do a pretty good job catering events) and it was pretty good.

There was a little bit of a wait on a Saturday afternoon, but we were seated fairly quickly (within 10min).  The dinning room is a massive high-ceilinged room that has a mixture of old world booths or tables.  What intrigued me the most was the staircase that lead to some of the event rooms that you can reserve for events.  We were lucky to get a booth, but it felt a little big for 2 people... more perfect for 3-4 people I guess.

Our waiters were nice and kept the water flowing.  I had a caesar salad which wasn't overly dressed and a good size.  The ridiculous size came in the food portions.... I had enough to eat for another meal - which is good because the food was very tasty.  Loved the bread and olive oil with balsamic.... that stuff will get me in trouble and basically force me to live at the gym."}
{"text":"Everything was great. My friends and I, a group of 12, came in around 10:30 on a reservation. We planned on eating really quick and leaving as closing is at 11 but we ended up staying longer until around 12 and the servers didn't mind at all.
The service was amazing 9 out of 10, the waiters were checking up on us and asking us how our prom was and cracking jokes and was the best part of the night. They got one of my friends orders wrong but it was alright as she didn't mind and we were all too hungry to wait for them to get her original order.
The food was 10 out of 10. The serving sizes are huge and I could barely eat any of it before I asked for a take-out box. This prompted everyone to say that they wanted some too and the server ended up giving all of us boxes, along with take-out boxes for desert without prompting from us. I got the 4 cheese ravioli and although there are only about 7 ravioli on the plate they are HUGE yet oh so delicious and fresh out of the oven that the plate was still burning hot.  desert was amazing, I got the new york style cheesecake and while it was small because I was doing a prom promo it was still amazing, it wasn't as dense as a normal cheesecake would be and with our stomachs full from the main dish that was perfect."}
{"text":"I never knew how big this place actually was until I was attending a lunch conference here.  There are a few meeting spaces upstairs at this restaurant and then another one hidden behind the downstairs bar and who knows where else.

So this review is for the family style lunch during the conference.  

The food was wonderful with 3 courses of food to share at each table.  For appetizers, there was bruschetta, fried zucchini, caesar salad and something else I am probably missing.  For entrees, there was chicken parm, a vegetable rigatoni and a spicy ziti dish.  And for dessert there was  NY style cheesecake and an baked apple dessert.  

The desserts ruled!!  There was plenty of food to go around.  Service was wonderful and I ate so much that I could have rolled back to work.

Honestly, there should be a law that all lunch meetings be held at Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Banquet, Banquet, Banquet. We searched all over Vegas for Banquet halls but none we found... including on Yelp, would work for us.  There are not many private rooms and the ones that offer it have extremely large minimums.  (So i'm mentioning banquet many times in the hope if will make it easier to find and share a good experience.)  Many positive things, including... no surprises at any time... what they said is what we received.  One of the best things... setting up the event.  Unlike almost any other event departments, anyone you email or call (one email, one phone number), no matter who picks up the phone (no screening), they immediately can answer your question.  This is a product of incredible management planning/system/training.  Food was excellent and staff really cared.  Nice strip view as well and a little outside patio. They have three rooms that connect, so they great flexibility for any size group.  I would go on, but have to get to work."}
{"text":"First time visit. Great view of strip at table. Wonderful atmosphere. Great food. Good prices. Great service."}
{"text":"We got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time.  It was not a deal breaker, but it was annoying.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

The bread is very good.  It is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes.  We ordered a few appetizers for the table.  I tried the mozzarella marinara.  It was surprisingly good.  Most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried.  The mozzarella here had good flavor, and the portions are good sized.

To start off my meal I ordered the side portion of the Maggiano's Salad.  I always enjoy this salad.  The house dressing has good flavor.  The blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too.  The portion is large.

For my main course I ordered the veal Parmesan.  The portion is huge.  It comes with a side of spaghetti as well.  The veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned.  I have had better, but it was fine."}
{"text":"3//17/18 We had lunch at Maggiano's....Chicken Piccata and Chicken Francese......lunch was $50(withOUT drinks),,,the service was very good ...the manager, Andrea was lovely...HOWEVER the carpet smelled so horrible from being cleaned we almost gagged on lunch(we couldn't even eat after that horrid smell).......Perhaps the manager should have moved us to the patio or another area?? NOT a good experience...

{"text":"Again, not impressed, although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience. I am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat. I should have known, but kept my hopes up none the less. My husband and I were invited to a date night dinner here, so we went along for the ride.

First off, service was a tad better this time around. Our waiter was a bit of an odd-ball though. I have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the Happy Hour price. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurant's extensive menu. Happily telling us all kinds of things, including his opinion of the Marsala sauce that is very unlike his Italian grandmothers.

Appetizers:

Calamari Fritte, served with marinara. It was fried Calamari. Luckily though it was not soggy or gross. It was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app. 

Spinach & Artichoke Al Forno - I am a fan of artichokes in apps. My favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is. However, I was not impressed with this dip. It is baked in an Asiago and Alfedo-like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip I have had.

Crab & Shrimp Cannelloni ($18.50) - Ugh! What a waste of money. This dish came out in a POOL of cheese sauce. Literally, the entire plate was cheese sauce. The menu description says this, \"Asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs\". No. There were no breadcrumbs. My plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce, with three lone Cannellonis that had, perhaps, 4-5 pieces of shrimp. The peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit. The cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop, just smooshy and gross. I was incredibly disappointed in this dish.

I wish I had gotten the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, which is what my husband got, and he cleaned his plate!

Creme Brulee ($7.95) - A huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough. Okay, I'm just kidding it wasn't served in a trough, but it might as well have been. The dessert portions are large, so ya know, share. My husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and I was left to eat the rest of it.

Again, as an overall opinion - it's over-priced, over-salted, overly-hyped Italian food on The Strip. It's a chain Italian restaurant I will continue to avoid."}
{"text":"Really good food, but the wait staff lowers the score.  Our female waiter came to our table five times while my water glass was empty, never offered to fill it.  That is poor service.  I handed the totally empty glass to the manager as we were leaving and expressed my disappointment.  Will probably give this another try, but would prefer Brio or Bravo."}
{"text":"The food here is very good here, however I left a prior bad review, but upon my second visit and explaining what my issue was, I taken cared of as if I were a princess."}
{"text":"Maggianos is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the valley.  Their menu is great because there is something for everyone no matter what type of budget you have.  We had a really wonderful experience with our waiter Kenneth.  He is  very knowledgeable, funny, and kind.  He was very prompt and he made our dining experience very pleasant.  We would definitely make a request for Kenneth the next time we visit.  I ordered the steak medallions which was  amazing!  My husband ordered the  shrimp scampi and it was delish!  We had a generous portion of  tiramisu for dessert, and it was definitely worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best dining experience I have ever had for some one with a garlic allergy. I always lets server know immediately that I can't do garlic at all. For the first time ever, the chef came out toy table with pen and paper to ask me about it. He was familiar with a garlic (allium) allergy and accommodated me by making a new breading for the chicken piccata that was free of onion powder. He also took the dressing of the salad and made a garlic free suggestion. He was amazing. Thank you Chef Alex. The food and service was outstanding. If you have a good allergy you are taken seriously at Maggianos. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Nous cherchions un petit restaurant ou s'arrêter un peu plus loin que les grand casinos, résultat nous sommes arrivé presque au bout du strip devant ce centre commercial, il était déjà une heure plutôt avancé. Nous avons tout de suite trouvé que l'ambiance de ce restaurant semblais calme et posée, exactement ce que nous recherchions. 
Nous avons donc diné dans ce restaurant et ce fut vraiment délicieux, le tiramisu est le meilleurs que j'ai pu manger, pas trop alcoolisé et plein de mascarpone comme je l'aime ! La quantité est au rdv et le rapport qualité prix vaut le coup

Je retournerais a Las Vegas ne serait ce que pour ce tiramisu !"}
{"text":"So, I finally ate at the Maggiano's that is in the city I live in.  Previously, I had only enjoyed the take out from this location, but had never eaten inside.

When I was in Denver, I ate at the one in downtown.  The Scottsdale Maggiano's did not disappoint!  I reciecved the same wonderful service as I did in Denver, and my meal was great too!

Now, please be advised that you can order half portions or full portions.  Half portions seem to be more then enought for most people.  Now...if your cooking skill is like mine (I make really fabulous reservations, but not much else) you may want to opt for the full portion, so you'll have left overs.  YUM!!!!

Great service and great food!  Maggiano's is alway consistant...no surprises!  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible dinner experience here over the weekend.  I ordered my usual spaghetti and meatball, but there was something wrong with my entree.  The pasta was so over cooked in places that it was hard, the meatball was cold (I could not eat it), and the meal left me sick for the entire next day.  It seemed like the dish had been sitting out for hours and gone bad.  Disappointing and also concerning in terms of food safety."}
{"text":"We hosted an event at this Maggiano's Restaurant and I must say that I was not very thrilled. The location is centralized so it was not very hard to find. Lots of parking.  The restaurant is beautiful. However, I will not recommend hosting a business meeting/dinner here.  The room we occupied was way too small for 20 people, although we were told that it was large enough to accommodate that amount of people.  The food was okay.  The calamari was my favorite.  They serve family style. Our server, Lorenzo, was very helpful and friendly.  This is a great restaurant to bring your family and close friends but not for business meetings or dinners."}
{"text":"Too dark booth for our party of 5 began a disappointing dining experience. Caprese salad & Proscuito Bruschetta appetizers. Caprese w flavorless mozzarella.  Our pasta main course was undercooked, although every dish had sat under the heat lamps/salamander too long. So, tough ravioli, penne (wheat) undercooked but meatball was pretty good. Since we were guests, we did not send anything back. I guess it's just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food. But that just doesn't make any sense does it?  What makes more sense is that they get so many customers they'll likely never see again, quality doesn't matter. Good thing there is Yelp."}
{"text":"Personally this place is just ok to me. The price kinda turns me off. They do like a generic Texas de Brazil buffet style type of thing. It's hard to explain. It's like 40 bucks & you get a salad, two other dishes + a desert. It's just a weird buffet sit at your table style. I will post the menu so you can see yourself. 

Don't get me wrong the customer service is good. The place is nice to be in, but the food is just ok. I would try for yourself, but to me it's not worth the money."}
{"text":"We had a great experience for our reception dinner.  We only had a small group (13 people) but I think even if we would have had 100 more people the experience would have been the same.  I was able to book everything online via email through Beth.  Beth was fabulous every step of the way, she answered my emails very quickly, always responded to my \"just one more thing\" and took a few moments to show me around when I arrived in town before our event.  When we arrived everything was set up and ready to go, we were able to step outside for less than 10 minutes, review our bill and pay it so we could just enjoy our evening. The flow of the evening went smoothly, the food was incredible, my guests are still talking about it and Joe kept our glasses filled.  My only complaint was that I didnt get to try the chicken dish that I heard was so delicious but that was my own fault (and Joes for being so efficient in filling my wine glass)!  
 
When we were ready to leave our leftovers were boxed up and ready to go which was great for our guests and ultimately us too as our flight was cancelled and it made for a great breakfast even though there was no chicken left over!  If you need a place to host an event this is the place to go everything was wonderful from start to finish, thanks again!"}
{"text":"They no longer have the creamy chicken soup and I'm sad."}
{"text":"First time eating at Maggiano's and I wasn't impressed at all.  The food tasted like grocery store Italian food from the freezer, the salad was great I don't think any one can screw up a salad.  The cheesecake was good also, I had lasagna and it really wan't good at all.  The service was great, the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait times specially for nights and weekends but once you're in, it's a great overall experience. Food was good and our server Gatsby was excellent. Felt something sharp that looked like a piece of toothpick and they took it back to the chef. They said it was a sprig from the herbs but it was rather large and painful and was replaced promptly. All the other appetizers and entrees were good and they comped the meal with the sprig. Good experience overall and will try again with a reservation."}
{"text":"We came here for New Year's eve dinner to meet up with some friends. Maggiano's has a family style dinner where you pick one appetizer, one salad, two entrees , two meats and two desserts for 4 people and a child. Our share came out to be around $89.00 with plenty of left overs. The proportions are a good size where there is plenty to share. 

We first had a complimentary appetizer come out compliments of the chef which had tomatoes, roasted garlic and  fresh mozzarella. It was like a mini Bruschetta bar. 

The salad we had was the Maggiano's specialty salad . It came with a light creamy dressing, crumbles of blue cheese and crispy bacon. It was light and didn't have a strong blue cheese taste.

The appetizer we chose was the fried calamari with marinara dipping sauce. The calamari was tender and it didn't taste fishy. It was a great choice instead of my first choice of mozzarella sticks. My friend was like \"you have to get your money's worth \"....lol....She was right on getting the calamari instead. 

The Shrimp Fra Diavolo I thought I would love but it was only okay to me. The shrimp was kind of smelly for me. I love shrimp but not in this dish, 

Mom's Lasagna was really good! I typically don't like  lasagna but I favored this  over the shrimp pasta. 

Veal Parmesan and the Veal Marsala was good but I liked the Veal Parmesan better because it was less salty. 

We had the Tiramisu and Apple Crostada for dessert which were
equally delicious. 

The service was wonderful and welcoming! We didn't feel rushed because of the holiday . The servers were very accommodating and happy to help us with anything from refills to taking pictures for our table."}
{"text":"I always loved Maggiano's. Loved all their pastas, desserts, soups, warm breads. This is my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Viva' Las Vegas, was my destination this weekend. And decided to take the girlfriend and parents to dinner here. I always enjoy this place. Did the family style, and if you never done family style food, well get on it. Its fun. 

Great food, from appetizers to entree's and also the desserts.. Everyone agreed the Mom's Lasagna was amazing, the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage was incredible , the  Crab & Shrimp Cannelloni was to die for, and Linguine & Clams,
Red or White Clam Sauce was out of this site. 

So heads up if you do go, maybe call ahead of time, its a super busy place. We totally lucked out and sat outside since it was nice evening. But inside is very nice. Do you need to dress up? I would say at least wear a collar shirt guys.. 

Our waitress for the evening was very helpful and very fun. The only problem it took a while for us to get our appetizers, which she apoligized all night long. We didn't mind, we had our drinks in hand and having a good time. But other then that another great experience in the book.. Hope you guys enjoy. Because the food is amazing.."}
{"text":"8/11/11

After reading so many reviews about how great Maggiano's happy hour was, I decided to check it out myself and use a $10 gift card that Maggiano's had sent to me in honor of my birthday.  [Yes, I'm writing this review almost two years' later... I am that backlogged with reviews and photos- bear with me.  I don't think that these should be discounted based on how long it's been since these visits, because I (and others) could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved, or in some cases, worsened.)]  

Was going to try a couple of the apps when I spotted the Four-Cheese Ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ#GzMWRgNr3Im5eTXGK5rFiQ on the dinner menu.  The description mentioned ricotta, cream cheese, mozz, and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce, and I was hooked (\"ricotta,\" \"pesto,\" and \"alfredo\" hook me in 95% of the time).  Unfortunately, the dish was a HUGE letdown... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA#dMECY1zFqidngRglm1e3sA  All but two of the ravioli were half-frozen (especially at the edges), and the flavors?  All of the cheeses, marinara sauce, and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same!  All bland, without any distinction between them.  I tasted samples from allover the plate, from all components, separately and together, and couldn't discern any difference.  Even the entree's appearance was subpar.  Suffice it to say, I have not stepped foot into another Maggiano's since.

The two good comments I could say are that the restaurant was quiet (no one was there) and the plates were quaint-looking, with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST creme brulee I have ever had. It is a must order. You really cannot order anything bad on this menu. We had family style with baked ziti and spaghetti & meatballs. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. Food and service were fantastic! I had the mozzarella marinara and the lasagna. Would order both again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to meet here because she loves the Italian feel of it with the red checkered table clothes. I was expecting a very old school Italian place, which still would've been nice, but this place was very nice! Food was amazing, and for the price even better! You can get an extra take home dish for free! They also have a light version of a few dishes for those counting calories. Our server was also very attentive and food came out before I knew it. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Less crowded, much cheaper, better service, and better food...  I don't want to go to any Italian restaurants in casino hotels anymore!"}
{"text":"I'm all in for this place. I just wish i felt better to better enjoy the food!! 
After a wicked Friday night, i just wasn't feeling it. Def needed some food and well the GF and were set on finding something gluten friendly. Enter Maggiano's and their gluten free pasta. Not to mention you can actually talk to the chef if you have some question. A+ 
I ordered up the Angle hair pasta with Italian Sausage and some kind of chunky diced tomato sauce.. AWESOME it was that was. The gf chopped it up with the chef for a minute and he came back with a baked zitti *Corn Pasta* type thing with chicken and tons of cheese. I stole a bite or two and yup YUMMO! 
The place looks super upscale and ultra expensive but really for where you're at and it being on the strip, it a must go."}
{"text":"This review is for my wedding reception 9/17/16 held in the combined rooms Calabria and Di Carlo. I got so many raves for our reception, and the process was super well done on their part. I was so happy with how everything went, and the communications before the wedding couldn't have been better! I started with Calabria only and ended up super happy I upgraded to include Di Carlo. You can see from my photos how good sized the Di Carlo dance floor ended up being! We also used their recommended photobooth company, and they were amazing, as was the floral company they used, better than I hoped for! We ended up with 49 total people, and you can see from the pictures this was a good size. Although we could have comfortably fit 60 in our space and still had the big dance floor and photobooth area. Our guests also utilized the access to the balcony, which was nice. The bar was fantastic and all staff were perfect. The only thing I would caution is that the speakers in DiCarlo did not work through the house system from Calabria and we did not have a DJ/sound system brought in, so our playlist was not super loud for dancing. We still had a fantastic time but this could have been better, the people there really tried to accomodate us though.  Another good thing about them is they try to get you the most for your money, the packages are all clearly laid out on their website, and they are extremely reasonable with what is logical for your specific event. AND OMG THE FOOD, everyone raved all weekend about our food, the sausage gnocchi being the favorite. You will not regret choosing Maggiano's for your event :) They even arranged a tasting for us in Houston at our local Maggiano's to help decide the menu.  The venue itself is gorgeous so not much need for dressing up, the people are fantastic, and the food is incredible. You can't beat the price either, it was a great value and a no brainer!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was great.  Our server was very helpful when I couldn't decide between two dishes.  

Don't skip dessert either.  They have miniature desserts that are the perfect size if you're worried about blowing your diet."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night at ~7:45pm with a party of 8... the hostess estimated a wait time of about an hour and 45mins; however, we got lucky and got seated in 20mins because a larger party had just left.

Everything seemed to have gotten off to a good start. Once we were seated our server was super knowledgeable of the menu, which was great. Also he tailored the service to our party which had 3 kids, this was also great.

However there were certainly some service failures... we sipped on water for ~25 minutes (yes I timed it) before our actual drinks came in and he would literally ramble off every single ingredient in the specialty menu before letting us order, it was like he was reading a disclaimer off of one of those TV commercials.

I finally ended up ordering the Chicken Marsala and the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce on the chicken marsala  was creamy but watery and the mushrooms were soggy and looked like they had been left in the salamander for too long. 

The Fettuccini was also a little tough and the Alfredo sauce had texture like mayo, not as creamy/runny as it should have been. It was chunkier than the marsala!

Overall, the atmosphere felt moderately upscale and the servers knowledge accompanied by the; however, for the price we paid the service and food quality did not meet my expectations. I would rate the atmosphere 4/5, the service 3/5, and the food quality 2/5

Tip: View is great, atmosphere is moderately upscale, and the service is adequate. If you're looking to impress a date this is a great spot. However if you're just looking for some great Italian food with your family or a large party this is not a good spot for the money.

Tip: Menu is small and it is periodically updated, something to keep in mind just in case you had a favorite."}
{"text":"Second time here and first time to review. A friend of ours made dinner reservations for Sat evening by the window and within 10 mins of arrival, we were seated right above The Strip facing the Wynn. My recommendation is to bring 3 friends so you can order the \"Family Style\" meal on the back of the menu. There are three price points and we chose the $30.95/PP. You choose and everyone shares 2 salads, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts. And if you want more, just ask. It is AYCE. :)

My rating is for the \"Family Style\" experience."}
{"text":"So it's been a year and now I'm back. 
 Reserved a booth online at 6:38pm for 7:45pm they said we don't have you for a booth to my wife. 
 Waiter complained about just being given 3 tables at once. Manager wants to buy our appetizer. Wife is very upset. 
And we have not even ordered yet. 
 We have now seated and got a starter. 
 It's 9pm starter very good wife cooling down.
 Our meals were very good the waiter was and had got better. The food saved most of the experience. 
 So far. 
 Very good tonight except for the reservation process. 
 May return in less than a year."}
{"text":"Ugh. We came in for dinner on New Years Day (1/1) and seated ourselves in the bar area. 

Yes it's busy. I mean it's a holiday in Vegas right? The hubs and I swung by Vegas just to see what the type is all about. 

My fave Maggiano location is South Coast in Newport. It clean, food is favorful, great texture, and well attentive and high class staff.

This Vegas location. We were highly disappointed. I ordered the frutti de mare. Fancy sh!t right? Man, my entree was salllttttyyyyy. My blood pressure and sodium level just increased - nurse dilute me! My husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari. It tasted reheated or microwaved. 

Our drinks were the best of the night - a coke and a glass of wine. Prepared directly by the company. No chefs needed. 

$70 was our tab and I shake my head to this restaurant and wanted to slap the chef silly. We should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream Italian restaurant - Buca di Bepo instead!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this new location. We have always been fans of Maggianos at Fashion Show Mall but the drive to get there, get in and parked, and fight the absolute packed HOARDS of rude tourists to get a table is enough to deter us in the past. This location is far from the strip, easily accessible, quiet yet still busy even on week nights, and has far better and faster service. We have come three times now and the service was excellent and food was great.

Portion sizes at Maggiano's are always huge on the main pasta dishes. We HIGHLY recommend the Marco's Meal For Two. With this deal for $42.95 you get an appetizer, two entrees, a dessert of choosing and two take home entrees with are just a large as your sit down entree. You really cannot beat the price for the amount of food you are getting. Four meals really for a steal. 

We really enjoy the Fettucine Alfredo. The sauce is fresh, homemade and just right and the pasta is always perfectly al dente. The take home portion is also lathered in sauce, enough so that you don't even have to heat in the oven, we just microwaved it and it was still just perfect. The sauce did not separate into an oily mess which seems to happen whenever we went to the location at Fashion Show on the strip. 

We recommend the Apple Crostada for dessert. It is the perfect finishing piece if you are stuffed and too full for a heavy chocolate dessert. Perfect outer pastry shell with sugar crystals and apple pie type filling. 

We really enjoy the \"sit down high end\" setting at Maggianos since you feel like you are at a fancy restaurant but at the same time can be comfortable in yoga pants or baggy tshirt and jeans since it is not a pin drop quiet 5 star restaurant where you are required to have upscale dinner attire. Excellent filling food with a higher end design than an Olive Garden, but still comfortable and \"homey\"."}
{"text":"Love Maggiano's for great pasta! 

Maggiano's is noted for their excellent sauces and pasta combinations. You usually get a quite large portion as well. I can usually barely stuff half the bowl down and have to take the rest to go.

I am a fan of the simple fettucine alfredo here. Their sauce is homemade and has that traditional cream taste that is perfect and blows chains like Olive Garden out of the water. Add chicken if you get the chance....the chicken is that soft, pulled chicken taste like it came off a rotisserrie chicken, instead of the gross, rubbery cubes or strips that you get at lesser chain restaurants. So yummy!

Dishes are plenty big to share. Appetizers as well. We order the Fried Mozzerella and it is definitely enough for four and impossible for two to eat alone. Very reasonably priced as well, right on par with Olive Garden, but much, much better quality.

If you do the large 'family style' dining or have a birthday they bring you these soft cookies with a lemon glaze that is perfect for nights when you are already stuffed full of heavy pasta. The perfect quick, sweet bite.

Only warning is this is not a location that is a quick stop. Save for rare occasions they are extremely busy 7 days a week. Even with a reservation you will likely end up waiting 10 minutes or so before being seated. Request to be seated away from a main aisle way or you risk getting jostled and bumped by passing rude dining parties. 

Have always had exceptional service by the servers. They are always personable, quick and welcoming. 

There is a kindly older gentleman who usually comes around with a guitar or accordion (?) and offers you a song with your meal. This is perfect for those celebrating a birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"Came with a big group of 20 and enjoyed lunch very much. Everyone liked it. 

They put bread on the table with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was very good...crispy outside and soft center. 

I ordered the Lobster Carbonara. The pasta was cooked al dente, as it should be.  The sauce was creamy and tasty. It has pea pods instead of single peas, which I liked better anyway. There was plenty of big chunks of lobster throughout, and only a few pieces were the opposite salty, bitter side of the claw.  Too many restaraunt slip those pieces in instead of the sweet delicious side of the claw. Not this place....plenty of real sweet lobster. Yum!

A little pricey, but the portions are huge, atmosphere elegant, and wait staff superb. So worth it!"}
{"text":"It seems like we end up eating here every time we come to Vegas. This time was a little different because we brought out 2-year old son. I tried to be respectful of the other people eating, so when I made the reservation I requested a table in a far corner of the restaurant. We get there and get seated and they put us at the table in the main dining area in the corner right next to the window that overlooks Wynn. We have eaten at this exact same table before, but not with a baby. Anyway we decided to stay and have a wonderful meal. The waitress was very helpful with my son, from making sure he had a cup with a lid to bringing us extra straws for him to chew on. The food was great like every other time we went. I had some type of pasta with Lobster all up in it. DAMN it was good. I savored every bite. Everyone else in our party loved the food as well. Even when my son screamed a little, it didn't seem to bother anyone else sitting around us. That may have been because we were there for reservations at 5pm and we were there for an hour and a half or so. So many of the dinner people probably would not have started getting there for another hour or so. 

Great time again Maggianos, I have a feeling we will be back next time."}
{"text":"I should probably just cut and paste a review I have for Maggiano's in the Bay Area, but that would not be fair.

To be honest, all the maggiano's are about the same...which is a good thing because I really like their food!

We had their banquet style menu and the appetizers were great--fried calamari, salad, and stuffed mushrooms (THE BEST) to kick it off...

All the entrees were spot on...including the salmon (cooked perfectly, which is hard to do w fish in the large quantities they gave us) and the chicken marsala.

The desserts were heaven--the giant chocolate mountain cake (at least thats what I call it cause it looks like half dome at Yosemite) was sweet enough to make you instantly diabetic, and the tiramisu was the perfect texture of...well...tiramisu.

Throw in sangria to add a kick to the night, and we are talking one very good meal with great friends!

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I went to Maggiano's as a banquet customer and I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food. The host who booked the catering with Maggiano's joked that the chicken marsala was tongue that was dine badly because it was so tough it was impossible to even cut it with my butter knife and I chiseled at it for quite some time...and trust I really dug in, especially since I had a cocktail or two prior and...that dish was unforgivable. Never mind the fact that their pasta with meatballs served family style only had about eight meatballs that were no bigger in circumference than a quarter and that was expected to serve three people...in what world?? I have nothing against old people, however the seasoning in this restaurant is the most suited for senior citizens who have a very sensitive palette to any seasoning. This is obvious by the majority of the clientele at the restaurant that has all white hair and they are clearly in their late 60's to mid 70's. I am so disappointed because I have been looking forward to going to this restaurant for nine years and now that I have come, I was utterly let down and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This past Friday  (10/16/09) we stopped in and enjoyed a wonderful 4 cheese Ravioli covered in a Pesto-Alfredo sauce and sprinkled with Parmesan. It was magnificent. The generous fresh bread and stuffed mushroom appetizer was wonderful as well. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Monday by myself at 6pm - it was busy but I was seated at a booth without hesitation.

The menu is vegetarian friendly - I chose to get the half-order of spaghetti with a mixture of marinara and white sauce. While waiting for my entree, I munched on the fresh bread that I dipped in olive oil - mmmmm!

The spaghetti was good - I would have finished it if hadn't eaten the bread.

My waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient.

Yeah, its a chain but for the price point and compared to what's around, you get not only a good deal but good food too."}
{"text":"Recently visited this place again for the second time. The food here is just so damn good, mouthwatering dishes I would say. Also, this place has a wonderful view to the strip and very nice customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to several other locations so I was very excited to try this one. 

The layout is typical but I loved the high ceilings and the upstairs portion of the restaurant. It was a bit sad yet entertaining to see the continuous look of dread every time a server had to trek their way up those stairs with a handful of food. 

Our server was very nice and personable.  He suggested the ravioli dish that was on special that came with the truffle cream sauce.  I ordered this as well as the pepperoni risotto bites. The fried risotto bites were impeccable; best I've ever had anywhere.  The creamy red sauce was a nice touch as well. The ravioli special had a nice flavor but was missing some saltiness in the sauce. The ham was a nice touch but still lacked it that burst of flavor that salt would've helped provide. The cheesecake was very rich and creamy not to mention huge.  

Towards the end of the meal I found myself waiting a long with for refills, my to-go order, and the check. I was eager to leave at that point and get back to my travels but I guess the server enjoyed my company. 

I would still recommend this place to folks looking for a good Italian option."}
{"text":"We went here for my son in laws birthday as this is a place we wanted to come to.  This place is classic Vegas and the service is actually pretty good.  This place does get crowded so a reservation is suggested.  

The food is ok...I have never had anything here that I would say was off the charts.  The prices are a little higher then you will find in other Italian places but its a chain and its on the strip. 

The food is cooked good but there are a lot of items that are bland and under seasoned.  What makes up for the food is the ambiance and I am going to steal this part from my friend and fellow Yelper, Gregg W. who said this part best.  

 Classy, Rat Pack Music, Meticulously Clean, Upscale.

Men...wear a suit/tie or dress it down nicely casual, but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here!  

The dark wood interior walls have some nice old Las Vegas framed black n white photos. Tables are white cloth. Nicely dressed wait staff. Bathrooms even have cloth towels! Just a very classy Italian restaurant!

*Full bar w/ dining option. 
**Happy Hour specials. 
***Reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more, etc.  

So I say you should visit this place, try a few different dishes and share your opinion here on Yelp.  This is not my first choice of a place to get Italian food here in Vegas,  but if you like a chain and are familiar with the food and you like it, GO, GO, GO and enjoy...its not a BAD place by any means, just not up to my liking to say it is a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced in my opinion but good standard Italian comfort food. Ordered a French cab to sip on, a simple spaghetti with marinara sauce, and a side of cooked spinach. What more could a girl need? I came here in the daytime for lunch on the strip so it wasn't too crowded at all. Service was prompt and food did not take ages to come out. Good job!"}
{"text":"Was super slow tonight . Good good service ok. Got my order wrong at first . Then my take out veggie only salad was tiny at $15 plus 20% tip. Sad"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal or service here or any other location for that matter. Some of my favorites include:

Frozen Bellini Swirl (my favorite!)
Italian Tossed Salad
Spaghetti & Meatballs
Baked Ziti
Four Cheese Ravioli
Lighter Take Chicken Marsala (my favorite!)

I am so glad they've incorporated the \"Lighter Take\" menu items as they are all very delicious, but you aren't using all your calories in one meal! All of the desserts I've tried have been great, especially the lemon cookies. 

Highly recommend even though it is a chain, but it is much better quality and service then other Italian chains out there."}
{"text":"If you ever come across a Maggianos you've got to stop and have the regatta I \"D\" it's so AMAZING GREAT!! The chicken and Carmelo zed onions.mmmmmmm!!!!
Also if you like sangria??? YOU'VE GOT To Try it!! It's so refreshing after you've been in the heat."}
{"text":"I planned on coming here with my friends for my birthday next month, but instead, we came here to celebrate her's instead. I was impressed with the setup, customer service, and the food was delicious. My friend and I enjoyed the view of the strip as we gormandize our meals. I think the price was reasonable considering all factors taken into account. The Parmesan Veal was on point! Unequivocally, I will come back."}

{"text":"Maggiano's is a classic Italian resturant from the checkerboard tablecloth to the Sinatra playing on the speakers. The front doors lead to the bar area, proceeding to the right leads to the dining area, and eventually the brick patio. The walls are adorned with black & white portraits and autographed photos (i.e. John Elway).

The wait staff is helpful and courteous. Fresh bread is served with olive oil almost immediately. The menu is expansive with classic Italian fare (ravioli, ziti), steaks, and seafood. I can personally testify that the Chicken Parmesan are good. The portions are enormous. My buddy will be eating pasta for a week. Most dishes were $15-25.

All in all, a very nice experience. Not my favorite Italian spot, but certainly a good spot."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian restaurant I've been to in the entire Phoenix area since I moved here from the East coast five years ago.

The server was excellent! 

And the food was outstanding! I've finally found a restaurant that makes gravy (red sauce) that's thick with just a hint of sweetness, like my mother used to make.

And I couldn't believe that there's a \"Buy One, Take One Home\" section on the menu. What a deal! My lasagna was terrific. Instead of ground beef, it was made with a slightly spicy sausage that had been broken up perfectly (no chunks or tough pieces). Plus, I now have a complete spinach ravioli dinner in my fridge, to be heated up tomorrow night.

An to top everything off, because I was a first-time customer, the chef came to our table after the meal, introduced himself, and gave us a plate of chocolate truffles.

This restaurant: magnifico!"}

It's about a 30 minute ride to get here, but we've decided it's totally worth it, for the chicken parmesan alone!  Love, love, love it!!  We have done the Marco's Meal both times, and been totally happy with everything from the caesar salads to the double chocolate brownie for dessert.  Plus, as a bonus, we get to enjoy more Maggiano's the next day with our extra meals.

It doesn't get much better than this!  I already told hubby that this is where I want to spend my birthday in a few months...can't wait!!!!"}

The service is fantastic and you can tell that everyone is appreciative of their customers. Everything they make here will make your taste buds happy. I especially love the Rigatoni D and their Eggplant Parmesan. We had a fantastic time with great food, wine and outstanding service. The bar area is a great place for meeting friends and enjoy some drinks, appetizers, light meals or even dinners. When it's warmer but not hot, I also enjoy their patio with a quite dinner."}
{"text":"Loved it! Good atmosphere, great fooooood! oh and the dessert! yes. 

Now.. there was a odd conversation we overheard about a guy who was name dropping a whole bunch, as if he was some high roller, other than that, loved the restaurant, service and food!"}
{"text":"The mussels in the spicy tomato sauce was superb as well as the shrimp scampi the desert sampler was five ok the best I have had. Our waiter  Brandon was wonderful helped with suggestions. Recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"Had our wedding reception in the banquet hall, and it was an amazing space for our party. 
GREAT Service
GREAT Food
Great Drinks

Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my family and ordered an appetizer, a few pasta dishes and two desserts. We received great service and the food was tasty, my Daughter finished her whole meal, which means a lot to me when she enjoys a good meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to take the family to Maggiano's when we're in Las Vegas.  The food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite!  It's family style so it's obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large - even for family style. The stuffed mushroom appetizer, the caesar salads and the linguine/clams in red sauce are my recommendations. The service at this restaurant is amazing, as well. My drink was never  empty, they timed each course perfectly so that I was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before I had time to even notice they were gone.  Great experience!

The restaurant is, also, on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary. Authentic Italian food that's quality and affordable. The atmosphere is great as well. Great food great service. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"First Time visiting this fine restaurant.(January 9,2017 around 8 pm)
Definitely not disappointed about it! 
It is HUGE restaurant. With seating inside, bar, outside, patio and even when the mall is open next door they have some tables set up there. So seating shouldn't be a problem. 
Our waiter was James. What a very helpful and a polite waiter! Always came by to see how we were and asked if we needed anything. TRUELY GREAT!  
We ordered 2 side orders of Caesar Salad, Fried Zucchini, Prime New York Steak with Potaoes and pasta dish. We first brought bread to table. Very good. Then were brought our salads. Very good. Then the Zucchini. OH MY! AMAZING! So crisp and loved the seasoning! And lastly our main dishes. The steak is a on the pricer side of things but WORTH it! It was so good my girlfriend took so much away for me! 
Overall it was very good and I was VERY pleased with our visit. I will be back when I'm back in town!

Side note. Only thing I will ding about this place is that a photographer comes to your table and takes a picture of you and your guest and then comes back to show you the pictures so that you can buy it if you want to. BUT the one we got was pretty rude with us. Seemed visibly upset when we didn't want to purchase any of the pictures. Gave us some looks but we didn't let that affect our evening."}
{"text":"First off, I don't recommend coming here. There's 2 other much better Italian restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. My family had such high hopes because we ate at the Maggianos a while back located in the strip and had a good experience. However this time, it was nowhere near pleasant. 

Our waitress didn't even know the menu. She told me that I could not have the Spaghetti and meatball and meat sauce together, but can only order Spaghetti and marinara and the meatball. However the menu said I can choose either sauce.  When we showed her, she seemed flustered. I was quite surprised when she told me that because spaghetti and meatball must have been a popular dish on their menu. Throughout our lunch, she was in a rush. While we were still eating she would keep asking us if we were done eating and take our plate. 

For food, we ordered the lobster carbonara and spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce, both of which were below average. They came out cold and dry. The lobster looked and tasted dry as if it was defrosted. It would be better if it were more fresh, juicy, evenly cut, and were bigger. The lobster and noodles weren't coated in sauce either because it sat for so long. The noodles were okay but wasn't amazing as they made it out to be because it was \"made from scratch\". The meat sauce of the spaghetti with meatballs was VERY soupy, sweet, and unseasoned. Another result of sitting out for so long is the soupiness of the sauce. The meatball wasn't as juicy or tender as the one from Trattoria Reggiano. I honestly think anyone could make better pasta at home. 

After this upsetting experience, they made a mistake when charging us for the Spaghetti and Meatballs. It took another 10- 15 minutes for the manager to come and fix it, and she didn't even bother to ask if we wanted to change the tip. 

If you try Trattoria Reggiano and Maggianos, you will see what I mean in this review. There is something significantly missing here. If they want to survive amongst the 2 other Italian restaurants, they're going to have to improve their service and food."}
{"text":"I spend quite some time during the week at Fashion Show Mall for various reasons and Maggiano's is a tough place to beat. Every dining occasion I've had here has been more than enjoyable. 

We were seated right away and our server this time around was great. I was impressed with how often he checked up on our table and he took the time to hold a conversation with our family.
 
I tried their lobster carbonara and their chicken flatbread has always been a favorite! If you haven't tried, this is worth a share around the table. 

Food is always prepared as quickly as possible but still maintains its quality and taste. Will definitely return for many meals to come!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for what we thought would be a lovely after Christmas wind down lunch. This is (or used to be) one of our favorite places to go. For what it is, it's a little on the pricey side but that's totally ok because we just love it for date nights. Well...there was a little bit of a miscommunication I guess when we and another couple got sat. The other couple looked like a mob boss and his mom. No waiters came to greet either table for at least 20 minutes. We were sat directly across from each other and we were able to watch this man get angry with every passing second. So he got up, irate and complained and within seconds he was handled by the 2 managers...waited on hand and foot for the duration of their visit. Us, on the other hand had to beg for a server and got a vague apology for the wait. Even though we were sat at the same time we just happened to be nicer about it than mob boss across the way. Our server sucked. When I asked for more water he said \"gimme that\" and pointed to my glass. He was slow, forgot things I ordered and seemed rude and bothered when I asked for things I had ordered and never got. They weren't busy at all it was lunch time and maybe like 6 or 7 tables were in there total. Again I'm not really bothered by a lot I'm pretty patient but it was weird to see another table that was in the exact same situation as us being treated like kings.  So it bothered me and I emailed corporate to find out why the difference and got a really lame response saying they'd pass it on to that location to handle. Never heard back. Normally I'd let it go but in all honesty I think I would rather save a trip to maggianos for the times we go to Vegas than bother with visiting this location again. It truly left a bad taste in my mouth with the lack of customer service. It's like they don't even care about the people spending money in their establishment."}
{"text":"Seriously wonderful service, the food was AMAZING, and great atmosphere. Definitely coming back, we had a great waiter, Eric, and that made the experience even better."}
{"text":"Mark our amazing waiter suggested everything we ordered. Kevin, my husband's vote for best chicken and waffles. Peach Bellini. Crème brûlée French toast. Lemon ricotta pancakes . You have to get brunch here.  Great service. Beautiful restaurant. Great views."}
{"text":"It may have been due to high volume of large parties today but the quality of food was mediocre. The sauces for the pasta dishes were more liquid than creamy or rich. It was a disappointment to have ordered the more rich white sauces and receive a quality more like soup. Our server seemed rushed and in the need to go other places than stay attentive to us. He barely checked on us or cared for us. However this may be due to the fact we sat in the bar area. But I still think we should've received more than just a \"check in\" once and nothing else."}
{"text":"We've tried to eat here once with the kiddos. Bad day, it was busy. This time we lucked out on our date night. We tried to get seats 15 minute wait. Luckily 2 seats opened up at the bar. Our bartender/server Rebecca was excellent. We already know the food is out of this world. But just service alone will get us to return.

Eggplant parm is my go to. It was so delish. Wife ordered filet mignon asparagus mushroom risotto. I couldn't eat meat but the risotto was terrific. Just from her cleaning her plate, I knew it was good.

Now our server Rebecca, very nice, pretty, personable. I wanted a sangria she recommended the seasonal sangria and it was so good. If I wasn't the DD, I would of ordered myself a pitcher. Her attentiveness was real good. I love great service. Thank you Rebecca, next date night we're sitting at your bar!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I was brought here for a business dinner a few days ago. Contrary to other reviews, the food was not even mediocre. The spaghetti marinara was bland to the point where I considered asking for salt. Same said for our green bean side. The rigatoni was al dente to the point of being crunchy. 

For larger groups, they serve 'family style', but the amounts they bring are obscene to the point where we all felt guilty, hoping that our leftovers were somehow donated to local food kitchens (if they do donate leftovers, please correct me! That would bump my review up a star for community support. )

I asked our dinner sponsor to never bring us here again."}
{"text":"First time here and Dereck, Antonio and our server, Albert, made it great. 

The food was flavorful and the place is really clean. The hostesses sat us quickly and our server, Albert, immediately approached us. He told us about the menu and specials with recommendations. Before ordering, Antonio came by and greeted us with a sample of their bruschetta and welcomed us as first timers. What a rare gesture. 

After our meal, Dereck stopped by to make sure everything was to our liking. We really enjoyed the company, ambience and food. Albert is a top notch server and went the extra mile to make our experience a memorable one. 

Thank you and we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This was pretty great! Was craving Italian and looking for somewhere nearby. Maggiano's had great food! We arrived during happy hour so we got the flatbread for $4!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner a few times this year, and every time it has been excellent.

The Rigatoni D is fantastic, and the fried zucchini cannot be missed -- very crispy!

All in all and great place for Italian if you're on the strip."}
{"text":"Wife & I went Sat. Booked a reservation thru Open Table, but the restaurant was having trouble finding it. They said they were having issues with them.
Yuli, our server was great. She explained the family dining deal & we went for it. What a good deal. My lasagna was great, as always, bread is fantastic. Wife had chicken alfredo & enjoyed it. Had the choc. cake for dessert, again very good. Then we got to take home 2 more entrees, so we had dinner again sunday night. Can't wait to go back. Hope they fix Open Table issues."}
{"text":"Make sure to call ahead and make reservations. Typically this place is full and incredibly loud. The starter bread is awesome and you have salt, pepper, parmesan and olive oil to make a tasty dipping sauce. Typically when I come here I'm in a group of 5 or more and our service has always been awesome. The food comes out hot and fast and it's always pretty tasty. There are back rooms for big parties that are nice looking and pretty quiet. This is one of the better places in town for Italian food."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant when I use to work in the OC.  I love this chain compared to Olive Garden.  Every time I have been to a Maggiano's whether it is OC or here, I always seem to wait a little.  Just my luck probably.  We like the atmosphere and the food is good.  Below are the usual that we order:

Appetizers: Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms
Pastas: Spaghetti Meatball, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna
Desserts: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu

Pastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.

This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.

The only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  We have kids so this was rather inconvenient."}
{"text":"My review is overdue... Review from a 08/16/2011 visit

Came here on a Tuesday morning to eat brunch after a weekend full of staying up late. Got seated towards the back area with a view of the Encore/Wynn, our server was a great host since obviously we were the only ones there, provided great privacy and comfort to act a little hung over. I ordered the chicken florentine to my surprise, it was delicious and was a great proportion where I felt skinny for not tearing up my plate! (Or maybe it was my slight hangover?) The food is great for it being a mainstream/chain restaurant. I was expecting it to be like a Coco's type, but to gladly it exceeded my expectations.
Will come back on my next visit and will recommend!

Happy munching!"}
{"text":"This review is based on food and service only!

First off, the server asked if we had been to Maggiano's before. We stated we had and she asked if she could point out some items on the menu. We said sure. She proceeded to explain everything and I mean everything on the menu. It was strange but we just brushed it off.

Then our order goes as follows:
Drink order, that went fine.
App order, Mozzarella marinara app. 
Server puts in app order and comes back to take order.
Start with a bowl of claw chowder for the table to share, Ceasar salad with a side of anchovies. Kids got meatball spaghetti and moms lasagna and we got linguine di mare with a side of meatballs. Ok order done.

Soup and salad came out first, ok fine. Two bites into the soup and there were shells inside. Not typical of claw chowder but not even 30 seconds later the mozzarella marinara came out. They were cold. Now we have cold mozzarella and soup with shells in it. As I'm looking around for server she's no where to be found. But then to our surprise the kid's meals come out. I'm like we still have our soup, app, salad, haven't even eaten them and now you're bringing out the entrees. I tell her we don't want the soup because it had shells in it. She takes the bowl and doesn't say a word.

As I'm waiting for our entree to come out since the kids entrees came out so fast...nothing. We waited, and waited and our kids ask if they should continue to wait for our meal to eat. We say no, eat your food. As they have now finished their meal, the server comes to the table and says \"you ordered linguine di mare right?\" My husband says I don't know did we? She said yes you did but I want to make sure you know they have shells in the entree...shock look on my face must have been priceless. I simply stated yes I am aware and she says because you complained about the soup...wow.

Ten minutes after that interaction our linguine di mare finally comes out but no meatballs. We don't even bother asking for them. Linguine had no flavor to it. It was more liquidity then thick soup like other di mares are. Barely any shrimp and the mussels were gamey and were over cooked, not good at all. Meal overall was extremely salty.

Server returns and doesn't ask if we enjoyed it...she should have been able to see that we didn't since we didn't eat it. We ask for the check and she returns and says I told my manager about how you didn't like the clam chowder so she took it off. I was surprised that a restaurant like this a manager didn't come to our table themselves. 

We definitely will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"there for business dinner and had great experience!  food and service were exemplary.
it's my favorite place in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Vegas! I had salad, spaghetti, lasagna, fettuccine, ravioli and dessert family style with 20 of my best friends, we loved it! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Food coma... 
Maggiano's is a real treat when we get our family together to enjoy an Italian meal, it's truly authentic and home style. 
We ordered the Marcos meal for two, you enjoy an appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert for under $45, in addition, you get to choose 2 entrees to take home separate (frozen meals). Score. I love this concept. I love all the leftovers and Maggiano's brings the leftovers to the next level.
We chose the Margherita flatbread for appetizer and it's a light option to compliment what's about to happen for entree. 
Chicken parmigiana is a MUST TRY, it makes you wanna chew slowly, enjoy every bite and hope it doesn't end fast. The baked ziti. The fettuccini Alfredo. Need I go on? It's all mouth-watering, your taste buds will thank you. 
All this ranting and raving and only 4 stars? We've had the same server in the past and I cannot with him. He makes me anxious! It's as if he knows what you're about to say so he tries to finish your sentence... he's too quick and not in a good way, a way that maybe your his last table and he's almost off kinda way. 
Everything else, impeccable per usual. 
P.S. even the grated parmesan at the table is addicting! I pour that cheese over everything!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the strip. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and ambience. The waiters were great and funny. We had our picture taken and a guy sung while playing his ukulele. The food was delicious. We had a spinach/artichoke dip amazing! I tried both of the frozen peach belinis one regular peach and the other with a raspberry swirl wine was my fave. Also, the alfredo for hubby was good. I had the Chicken/Shrimp Tuscan Pasta which was very flavorful. I took it home and warmed it up the next day and it was great plus it still held its creamy texture. Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"I've been generally disappointed in a lot of the Italian restaurants in Vegas, but Maggiano's might finally be what we've been looking for when it comes to Italian food in Vegas.  I had Chef KB's lobster carbonara and my wife had the gnocchi and sausage dish, and both were really good.  We also got a \"sampler\" plate of different bruschetta that was amazing.  Wine selection is pretty decent as well.   I'm betting we'll be back...."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by chance as my friends and I were walking down the street from our hotel towards Mirage hotel. At first, we thought it would be very expensive to eat there but since it's at the fashion show mall, we thought we'd stop by and check it out. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were pretty reasonable (except Steaks which cost over $40)

I ordered shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and I loved it!! it was very light in garlic butter wine sauce and unlike most restaurant, they put a generous amount of shrimp in there, which was awesome! It was a pretty decent sized plate too, but I ended up eating every bit of it! Yumm! 

My friends ordered the lasagna and they both loved it too. Good portion, very meaty, cheesy and delicious. (Yes, I had to take a bite for myself!)

We ordered a bottle of chianti for $36 (I think) and it was pretty good and went well with the food.  If you're planning on having at least 2-3 glass, that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually $10/glass.

Above all, our server was really nice, friendly and fun. I think her name is Lori (?)

Their freshly baked bread was soooo good, nice, fluffy and warm. I am not really a big bread eater, especially before my meal, but I ended up eating 3 pieces - dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated Parmesan cheese. Yumm!  

We didn't have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait. We were waiting for about 15 minutes but  luckily, we found a table at the bar, first come first serve, so we ended up eating at the bar area, which was just fine by us. They serve the full menu there as well.  They have a nice outdoor seating area as well. 
I'd recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or don't want to wait to be seated.

Sooo, Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely going back there, to try out their seafood Linguine!"}
{"text":"Thank you Maggiano's  for making my Moms Birthday dinner special ! The manager Jesse was friendly , helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay . Our waiter Nick was  professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest , an absolute delight ! We got the Calamari Fritti , Chicken Parmesan , Veal marsala , Chopped salad with chicken  and the Nonna's pound cake  for dessert !  Dinner was delicious and the service was superb !"}
{"text":"Had a great family meal here - the staff were very accommodating and friendly, and the food was delicious! What more could you ask for? Well, for me, I asked for vegan substitutions. For this, they sent the chef to my table (not my request, but a nice gesture). I I had the angel hair primavera without the butter and cheese, it was very tasty! It's hard to find good Italian food outside of NYC, but they do a great job here."}
{"text":"I like Maggianos considering I have found very few Italian restaurants that I enjoy eating at - this one is pretty good for the basics. The dessert isn't worth getting but the pasta (while not homemade - is plentiful) I find the basics chicken parm, marsala etc. are your best bet here."}
{"text":"We ended up getting reservations here for our dinner, the last time we were in vegas; and I am glad we did.  The service was great! I want to say our servers name was nestor? but I could be wrong, either way... great service. we had the margherita flatbread to start (delicious) and our server recommended a  dush to me which was amazing.  it was nicknamed \"grown up mac n cheese\" but it was nothing like mac and cheese.  I rarely ever give a place 2 thumbs up or five star etc etc... but the food and service were amazing."}
{"text":"It was amazing here! This is the first time in a while where the server gave my girlfriend and I at least 5 refills of our drinks. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Service, food, choice, location"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and really trying to like this restaurant,  I can not find anything positive about this restaurant.  Pasta is over cooked. I had eggplant parmigiana, I could not get thru the first couple of bites.  No cheese and just soggy, salty and bland.  Each time we have been here the servers don't seem to know the menu. the servers also seem to be too much at our table constantly interrupting our conversation. The drinks are weak.  3 strikes you're
 out. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a chain Italian-American restaurant that is surprisingly good. Definitely sure to fill the bill for a variety of appetites.

I have been dining at this location for over 8 years, and it has yet to disappoint. Their Chef's are very cautious when it comes to food allergies, and they go out of their way to accommodate nearly any request. They have even made me gluten free fried zucchini that is sure to compete with their original recipe.

Their portions are quite large and reasonably priced, making it the ideal location for large groups. They also have private dining rooms if celebrating a more intimate occasion or hosting a business meeting. Overall, an excellent choice no matter what the occasion. They do get really busy with conventions, etc. so make a reservation in advance. I can assure you that you will be happy with your experience."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing atmosphere. The portions are very big, take that into account when you order."}
{"text":"Wow that was really good. Sometimes you just need some delicious handmade Italian food. 

Tonight we ordered chicken parmesan, veal piccata, and the grilled salmon salad (mine). Everything was cooked perfectly and everyone left stuffed and happy. 

I ordered the grilled salmon salad which had lots of leafy greens, red onion, croutons, tomatoes, snap peas, and peperoncinos. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a good sized piece of fish. I got the dressing on the side as I like salads a little more dry and the dressing itself was so good. Not too sweet, like some honey mustards are, but the perfect amount of sweet and savory. The dish filled me up and I would definitely order it again. 

I also got to try the seasonal sangria and it was citrus-y and sweet and incredibly enjoyable. 

The staff are all polite and know the menu well. I'd recommend getting a table by the window or outside as it's a good place to look out onto the strip and people watch. 

Overall we enjoyed our experience here and we're looking forward to going back in the future. It's a great place to get some Italian food whether you're local or visiting in town."}
{"text":"Closes at 11:00PM on Saturday night. WTH? This is Las Vegas, for heaven's sake! We rolled in at about 10:52PM and were denied."}
{"text":"Do not pass go, do not collect $200.....go DIRECTLY to Maggiano's!  I had read the reviews about Maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.  We were not disappointed.  I asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didn't have a menu, but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  They even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if I wanted chicken parmesan.  Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming.  To make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only $6.  YES PLEASE!  I ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan.  All I can say is WOW.  My meal was BEYOND fantastic.  I fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster.  Both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day.  Hubby's grandmother came straight from Italy and trust me, these meals rivaled hers.  My only disappointment is we don't have a Maggiano's where we live.  Seriously, it was THAT good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is alright, and the food is good. Nothing special. But the service is exceptionally terrible. I stopped \"giving it another try\" because I just couldn't take it anymore. It amazes me that a place can consistently have bad service in Las Vegas. No thank you."}
{"text":"Last night was me and my boyfriends last night in vegas.. We asked our server Corinna  what was her favorites  and she told us the beef madalions and lobster pasta (cant remember the name) omg died and went to hevan after the frisf bight..beef was soo tender didnt need a knife and pasta was so cheesy  and delish. Plus you get warm rolls with butter and vinegar  and oil. Sk as the dinner came to an end we had left overs so she boxed them up for us and put in free lemon cookies. All around best service  thank you Corinna"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve the one star. First we weren't given menus or water until we had been seated at the hightop in the bar area for 20 minutes. The waitress was terrible. She had zero customer service skills. She never asked us if our food was good, if we wanted refills on water, or even dessert. Overall I found service to be very sub par throughout Vegas. Everyone that works in the hospitality industry there gives off this air of entitlement. Anyways, she got what she deserved, 10%. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas to get GOOD food and bad service. Skip this one."}
{"text":"I love this place. I came here with a large group and we were served family style with so many delicious entrees but this place had already won me over before the food came.The restaurant has a glass wall and if you sit in the right corner you can see the fashion show mall, wynn las vegas, and even down the north end of the strip. I loved watching the Wynn sign change colors and move as I ate and enjoyed great cocktails. The food was authentic Italian food and vey filling. Delicious. We had a ravioli that was too die for. A lemon chicken with capers, I think. There was also like a lasagna or something. I don't know but everything was good and just really above average. The girl sitting next to me hated seafood and wouldn't try a few things so she kept complaining but seriously grow up and eat some damn fish! This place is great. The atmosphere is homey and a little cheesy with Italian music playing. The lighting was dark and the table cloths where red and white checkered. I loved everything about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So I have eaten at most Maggiano restaurants and this one is my very best by far , whilst in Vegas for the past week we are there twice mainly due to the SUPERB service , we are very lucky where we sit so it's normally in the booths and first we had Paulo as our server he was unbelievable then we had Stephanie and she was also amazing. I never heard anyone around complain , thanks fir great food and great service . 
THE ONLY THING I MAY FIX OR CHANGE IS THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE LADIES AT THE FRONT. THEY NEED TRAINING IN DIPLOMACY"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great service! They give you another entrée to take home with you if you get a  certain Meal! It's a great deal"}
{"text":"The service was adequate if a bit stuffy.  A guitar player wandered the tables, playing Sinatra and various dubious Italian classics.  This place was... loud.  We had to shout to be heard.  They have crammed every inch full of tables so good luck trying to walk through without bumping someone.

We had the calimari, which was passable but was soggy in parts.  The disappointment of the night was their Steak Delmonico: unevenly cooked, it was drenched in a ghastly sauce from deep in a boiler pot somewhere.  No spice or pepper, and not a whiff of flavor from the fatty meat.  Marbled goodness, this was not.  Ravenous from a heavy workout earlier, I would have normally savaged this piece of meat.  But my body would have to do with a protein shake.  The waiter gracefully took the large remnants of this steak away without any chance of it going into a takeaway box.

\"Dat's Amore!\""}
{"text":"Will never come here ever again! Horrible service!"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to go to a chain restaurant when visiting Vegas but I had a glass of rose and the half portion of the shrimp diablo ?
The waiter knew I liked it spicy and asked the kitchen to kick it up a notch. 
Yum!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best locations on the Strip. If you go for dinner ask to sit in the main dining room (floor to ceiling windows facing Encore & the Wynn.). For lunch, I prefer the bar, especially if there is a game on.  Today, a couple of glasses of Pinot and the soup & 1/2 sand... Chicken meatball, killer.  Do it!  Maggiano's LAS rocks. Park underneath at Fashion Show."}
{"text":"We ate at Maggiano's at the Fashion Show Mall and the food and service was terrific.  The staff is very friendly and the manager as well.  Our food came out exactly as ordered, and tasted great.  We have dined here a few times and always find it to be great.  Looking for a good Italian Restaurant, I would highly recommend Maggiano's at the Fashion Show Mall.  We had the Chicken Marsala and it was delicious along with the Chicken Caprese salad and the dressing on the salad was soooooo good.  Best part the little Zuccotto bites for dessert.  Looking for a  good Italian restaurant then this is it."}
{"text":"This place is like a fancy Buca di Beppo.

We ordered the Old Famous Rigatoni, Baked Ziti Pasta, and the Surf and Turf.  The only thing I enjoyed was the Famous Rigatoni, very flavorful and delicious.  The baked ziti pasta was very bland and tasteless.  The surf and turf was a mistake for a pasta place."}
{"text":"We have been at this location many times and typically love the ambiance and food. Today was not very good. We went for brunch with our friends. They have always love Maggianos as well, but brunch was lack luster.
The worst dish of all was the pasta with langostinos and saffron cream sauce. It had almost no flavor at all. I tried pepper, then salt, then cheese. I couldn't rescue the dish. The crab cake Benedict was the only plate actually enjoyed. I was quite embarrassed for having suggested this idea."}
{"text":"The menu was exceptional with all of the Italian cuisine delights...Our waitress was so hospitable with the our questions and suggestions re: The Brunch menu. We sat outside overlooking the strip, very nice view. I enjoyed the Fettuccine with Shrimp. The sauce was very delicious"}
{"text":"Now, I've only been here once, and from that one dining experience, I am WAY impressed. It's 25 miles away from our house in Chandler, but my husband had a gift card and we wanted to try something new. Just the atmosphere alone is inviting. The ceilings are very high with a loft with seating as well. I ordered a glass of Malbec which is always delicious, and then we ordered off the pasta menu for $12.95. 

When my husband ordered his Spaghetti & Meatballs, the waitress asked him, \"And what would you like to take home?\" We looked at her like she had 3 heads! She explained that for $12.95, you receive a pasta to eat at the restaurant, and then you get to choose another pasta to take home with you. AND they definitely don't skimp on the portions, holy crap! 

I had the Baked Ziti....if I had died that night, I would have died a happy woman. Maggiano's definitely impressed us, and it is very far away so it will be more of a \"Special Occasion\" restaurant for us, but it's definitely worth the title!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night around 7:30. They were pretty packed, which I expected. The lady told me that it would be a 25-30 min wait. She took my phone number down and said the system would shoot me a text once they're ready. So my bf & I went to go find somewhere to sit & came back 30 mins later since that's what I had anticipated. It was 8:15 & this man started to get agitated with the women on the host stand because he checked in at 7:45 he says... so the lady just told him to stand by the light & someone will come get him. & obviouslyyyy, I'm standing here like... excuse me? I checked in 15 mins before you did & you get to be seated first????? Ok. We were seated at 8:20 - so 50 min wait. I don't mind waiting but I wish they told us it would be longer, yaknow? Anyways, that's why im giving 4 stars & not 5 lol. 

I ordered the lobster carbonara. It was delicious! I wish they put broccoli instead of the peas but the peas were crisp & it was great! There wasn't a lotttt of lobster on there but it was a good amount. My bf had the Tuscan shrimp & chicken. It was pretty amazing too. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate zuccotto cake? I think that's what it's called. Lol all the portions were huge! Definitely took about half of it to go. 

Our server was also great. She definitely made our dining experience amazing."}
{"text":"WOW! Strangely I live fairly close to a Maggianos and yet it took a trip to Vegas for me to try it out. What the heck took me so long???!!! This place is so yummy!! Our large group decided to get family style dinner. Salads were great, pastas were amazing! We got a salmon dish that was so good. There was a roasted chicken which was slightly dry, but that was the worst of it. 
Service was great and our waitress was right on top of everything! 
We even got to take home the leftovers....mmmm"}
{"text":"My what a difference a year makes...both in how I write Yelp reviews and in my Maggiano's experience. I was back at Maggiano's for a private event and this time it was much better. Yes, they serve the dishes family style. Yes, you pay a slightly inflated price I attribute to the unofficial Strip surcharge. You get past all that and you'll find some good food here. 

On this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more: Crispy Zucchini Fritte. The zucchini is a diet killer. Calorie counting? Yeah, forget about that. Just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does. 

The rest of the items I tried today were good, but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me. The Fettuccine Alfredo was respectable, not the best I've ever had but it certainly was filling and I sneaked in a second small helping of it. The Chicken Piccata was actually disappointing. I masked my disappointment by having more Caesar salad and where did that Zucchini go again? 

One note to the staff...the Lemon Cookies were too cold. But the Apple Crostada made me forget all about the cookies...

As this was a business function, the Maggiano's staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that I work with. All things considered 4 Stars seems appropriate. 

Almost forgot to mention one more thing. The Valet seems super slow here. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Food was out of this world. Love the buy one take one selection. Ask for the chef's specials! Great cocktails. We were celebrating a work anniversary. They had a lovely table set up with confetti brought out a plate with congrats 20 years on it with some cookies. There were 12 of us and they were very accommodating. Food took a little to come out but like I said there were 12 of us. The manager came out and asked how things were and took a photo of the group which was nice to have. The staff even signed a congrats card for our boss. It was a very nice evening. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! The meatballs are so tender. Spaghetti with meat sauce is delicious and hearty. Fettuccini Alfredo is good too. Sauce is thick and has the right amount of garlic. The healthier option Alfredo is also good too! Ziti is good but can be dry. Mushroom pasta is great."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to downgrade my prior rating but today's experience was polar opposite to our first visit and honestly if we hadn't had such a great experience the first time, I'm not sure I'd ever consider coming back. We started by being seated at a table with dirty glasses. Ugh! Not a great start. It then took a very long time for our server, Melissa, to greet us and she was quite elusive the entire visit. She either had more tables than she could handle or just wasn't very well organized. I'm not sure which and frankly it doesn't matter because the result was our waiting for far too long for our food (approaching an hour) and anything else that we needed (like refills). The ambience was good and although it was busy we were seated very quickly and the noise level was low for a crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a mix up with a take out order - I ordered a pasta and instead got a bag with flatbread. The manager Pat and bartender Alex handed it and did a phenomenal job. Not only they apologize for the confusion, they also made sure I got the pasta AND got to keep the rest of the food in my bag. What an excellent customer service experience despite the hiccup (which happens - I totally understand). Both Alex and Pat deserve to be recognized. I am definitely coming back here to eat and give my highest recommendation to this establishment. Nice job!"}
{"text":"We reserved a table for 7 on a Friday night for my 40th birthday weekend at Maggiano's, where my parents had previously been and had raved about. I had never been here but took their word that it would be great. Unfortunately, we were all extremely disappointed. 

Upon entering, we were all shocked at how warm it was in the restaurant, even with it being 100+ outside, it felt muggy and warm. We were promptly seated but that's where the good news ends. 

Our waiter was Billy and he was cheerful and happy to hear we were celebrating my birthday. He took our drink orders and disappeared. This was a common theme during the night. There were times we didn't see him for over 20-30 minutes. Busboys as well, at one point I had an empty water glass for 25 minutes, and as hot as it was in there, I was miserable. 

Ok, so a review of the food. We opted for the family style dinner for the 7 of us. I asked specifically if they made my favorite meal, penne ala vodka, where the pasta is extra \"al dente\", almost crunchy. Billy said absolutly, all their pasta is made like that. Awesome. We also ordered ceasar salad, tomato & mozzarella salad, fried calamari, balsamic glazed salmon, pasta with clam sauce and veal parmagian. 

On the plus side, the portions were plentiful. But once any plates were dropped at the table, we never saw a waiter or a server again. 
The appetizers and salads were great. After our appetizers were finished, the busboy asked if we would like more drinks. My brother ordered another pitcher of sangria for the girls. This is important. Remember when we ordered this. But the pastas were horrendous. Mushy and way overcooked. I was so upset since I asked specifically about this. And our waiter was no where to be seen. Finally, 25 minutes after our food was dropped off, our waiter surfaces after we flagged him down. I had also had an empty water glass for about 20 minutes at this point along with 4 others. I tell him what's wrong and he argues with me about it. I just start laughing at this point and tell him to forget it. He says the kitchen can remake it and I say what's the use? Dinner is over! Remember that pitcher of sangria we ordered? Yeah, it finally shows up now. None of us really want it now. Oh, and we had to order dessert. They forgot it was my birthday. 

Now here's the kicker. 4 of us end up getting sick that night. Turns out it was the 4 of us that had the balsamic glazed salmon. So my mom calls the restaurant to tell them and to complain about the general bad service we had. They do their due diligence, have the chef call her and tell her they are going to send her \"something special\" in the mail. That was SEVENTEEN DAYS AGO. She hasn't received anything from them. We spent almost $500 on dinner. What a waste for poor service and a lackluster dinner. 

Pros: portion size

Cons: Service, restaurant temperature, food quality, management follow through

All in all, I won't be back and neither will the 6 other people in my party."}
{"text":"Let's make this short and sweet...

Service - very poor
Food - average
Will I come back? - NO"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just found out about this place.  I'm a HUGE fan after just one visit!  I was blown away by the tiramasu.  The service was incredible.  The entrees were delicious. The atmosphere was very elegant as well.  You really can't compare Maggiano's to the other chain italian places because they are in a category all their own."}
{"text":"Best pasta I have ever had, waiter was really nice and attended to everything we needed. Everyone in our party loved their food and it was a very good meal. Would very much recommend this place great and positive, fun environment. I got the spaghetti with pink sauce, so good and the best mozzarella sticks ever! Bread was fresh and warm as well as their dessert being amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Yay Maggiano's!!! I'm honestly not the biggest fan of Italian food (weird, I know) but I absolutely love everything about Maggiano's!  Even though it's attached to the mall, the atmosphere is a little more upscale and the service is always excellent!  My favorite thing to order here is the buy one, get one deal.  I order the Taylor Street Baked Ziti for $14.25 and then get a free meal to go (Eggplant Parmesan is my other fave!). Both meals are super flavorful and delicious! Usually after all the (free)  bread and olive oil I eat when I'm there I end up taking home part of my meal too!  So I really get about 3 meals out of my order...not too shabby!  This past visit, we went to celebrate my Dad's birthday and told the waitress at the beginning of the meal, she brought out an entire sampler of desserts for us to celebrate!  I would highly recommend this place for a night out or a special event!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas to celebrate my birthday.  Wanted to enjoy a nice dinner here and a couple of other fine venues.  First, made resies on Open Table and asked for preferred seating.  Once arrived, my wife and I were greeted with a smile and my request was accommodated.  Secondly, the table provided was perfect!  Just like I requested. Yahoo! Ordered an Old Fashion with Makers Mark -- again perfect drink!! Kudos to the bartender!! No appies today but our meal was again made to perfection!  My wife had the herb salmon with spinach and I ordered the 16 oz. peppered crusted bone in rib-eye (rare) with roasted potatoes.  10s all over the board.  My wife said she loved her meals.  The salmon just melted in her mouth and and good flavor.  My steak was perfect, right temperature, full of flavor with the peppered crust and balsamic vinegar.  If Rover, my dog, was around, he would have loved the bone.  All in all, Maggianos was just an awesome venue to celebrate my birthday. This review would have been 5 stars but for the level of service from our waiter--if he would have checked in on us more often we would have appreciated it.  Lastly, the gentleman that sang me a birthday song--he's pretty good!!  My wife tried to video the entire serenade but only got half of it.  But that's alright--Enjoyed every minute of it.  Great place, delicious food, well made drinks and good entertainment-- stay awesome Maggianos!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I tried it for the first time tonight and were amazed with how great the service and food was. When we first sat down they gave us a small gift for it being our first time. My boyfriend got the steak and it was to die for. For dessert we shared a slice of cheesecake which was probably the best cheesecake i've ever tasted. Our server was great as well! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I moved to Vegas from NY one year ago. I can honestly say that Maggiano's offers some of the best Italian food outside Brooklyn and the Bronx' Arthur Avenue. 

Food, service and ambience were top-notch. Our highly competent and attentive server Nathan, made thoughtful recommendations and turned us all on to their amazing lemon cookies! I wouldn't have considered them for dessert on my own and I'm glad we ordered them. Like everything else we ate, they were out of this world! 

We've eaten there a number of times and can't wait to return"}
{"text":"The venue is very nice! The food is a bit expensive for its quality, but still very tasty."}
{"text":"A tear, trickles out of my eye as I sit here and remember how delicious it was. Ugh I wish that we had this place out in San Diego. The flavors were magically delicious and every bite was savory. The service was great and I only wish that I had room for more food because I wanted to eat more."}
{"text":"We were looking for Italian, and this place was easy walking distance from the Trump International, so we gave it a shot.

The decor is nice; they managed to make this place look older than it is. The staff seemed well-prepared and efficient, but this place really gets packed. I recommend making a reservation, otherwise you may wait 30 minutes or more.

The only thing that was a bit off was that they had a live guitarist/singer walking around the tables. He was a nice guy, but he made us a bit uncomfortable not knowing if we were supposed to tip.

We enjoyed our meal and the price was reasonable. If this place were in Hawaii, I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"The best Italian family style restaurant!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING.  My first night moving to Las Vegas I ate there and got terrible food poisoning.  I had a steak and got what was most likely E. Coli poisoning.  Would not recommend going to this place. There are much better places for Italian food even without the food poisoning."}
{"text":"I got talked into going here! If I made the dinner choice I would not have chosen Maggiano's but now after having it I can't wait to go back!
I ordered the chicken picatta. The chicken was cooked just right and it had just the right amount of capers.  It came with angel hair pasta that they put in a separate bowel.  I also ordered a side of grilled asparagus.  

I have been craving this chicken picatta since I finished eating mine! I was informed there is one in San Jose...I will be checking that one out as well and hope it will be just as tasty!

The restaurant is located at Fashion Show mall.  I'm usually not a big fan of mall food but this was pretty darn good.  Service was slow but they were friendly. There were a lot of people and the wait was around 45 minutes so we decided to head to the bar for seating.  We lucked out and found two bar seats.  

Great food, decent service, I would go back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this location. We recently had our wedding reception here for 50 guests. I cannot describe how perfect everything went; from the ambiance, decor, to the food. All our guests loved every minute and will eat here every time they visit Vegas from now on. Thank you Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Rarely have I dined at a place that deserves a coveted five star review from any website or critique but maggianos is nothing short of exemplerary, my biggest regret not remember the name of our fabulous waiter who I told myself I would leave the kindest note on the receipt. From the moment you go up the elevator and those double glass doors open to maggianos entrance things differ. A reservation was made at 10pm and upon being greeted was seated in a very haste but efficient way. Very good from the get go. We were escorted to the tables in the back and the lighting, decor and just about every nook and cranny seemed to give off a right at home vibe with elegance mixed in, a beautiful restaurant. It's easy to forget that this is a chain restaurant. We were greeted by one of the kindest waiters as of recent memory , puzzled by what to order wth the amazing selections I had asked for a recommendation on two dishes I had trouble picking of, and gave me his honest opinion. He recommended I go with a different plate and happily I listened . Absolutely no regrets! The rigatoni d was absolutely outstanding blending different flavors into one amazing plate, a smile was shown across my face with every bite. The waiter was very attentive offering bread when the basket was empty and making sure we enjoyed every bite , extremely knowledgeable  of the food he serves. Restaurant operators take note of this Guy , a fabulous waiter with an amazing dinner equals an experience that is unforgettable, making sure to take guests who aren't familiar with this establishment here and giving this place a try. The food the decor the atmosphere the staff, truly a five star experience kudos to the manager and everyone in the front and back who makes the maggianos experience come to fruition ! 
5 star review"}
{"text":"There is something seriously wrong with those meatballs. The big ones. The sauce sucked. That was legit the worst Magiano's I've ever had."}
{"text":"Its been a few years since I ate here and I was shopping and hungry so there ya go. It was about 12 on a Sunday. No wait for a table. They sat me and my little guy down at a nice table in the corner.
I ordered a very tasty raspberry iced tea and had one of the specials. it was a crap and sweet shrimp fondue with several toasty wedges to scoop up the fondue. Ryder had the angel hair pasta with olive oil and cheese sprinkled on it.
We both dug right in when it arrived..which it did very fast. I would give this 5 stars but the server let my tea run out and didnt refill it for about 10minutes after it was empty. Not a huge deal but the tea was really good and I would have drank 3 glasses of it..but I had 2.
She was also a bit slow with getting us the check and bringing me the change. 
I will have to let that slide tho since the food was top notch."}
{"text":"I know...the first question you are probably asking is, \"with so many famous restaurants on the strip, why are you eating at a chain.\" We had just arrived and wanted something light and close to our hotel. We love their salads so we went. We found this to be a great Maggiano's. Service was some of the best that I have received at a Maggiano's. Prices seemed a little higher...but it is the Strip, what do you expect. Great views of the strip also."}
{"text":"Visited the day before New Year's Eve. I think they were just really busy. Our food didn't arrive for 35 minutes & our drinks were never refilled. My server seemed so busy we could hardly gain his attention to ask for a refill & to ask for an additional place setting.

The service shouldn't take away from the food. However, when you pay $150 for a meal you expect great service. They failed on that front. 

Stay away during busy times. I'm sure they're much better during less busy times."}
{"text":"Our family has been at a couple of different Maggianos and this one in phoenix was no different than the others.  We went there for a birthday celebration and had a great time. When they found out we had a celebration the waiter made sure we got extra special treatment. We ordered family style and one of the chicken entrees was overcooked. The waiter,  with no problem, whisked it away and brought us a new entree. We were supposed to get a free dessert for the birthday and instead they brought us a big sampler dessert platter for the whole group.  We were so full!  They really know how to make everyone feel special.  The only issue was it was very crowded, so the tables are crammed in.  We were sitting next to a walkway,  which made us feel food would be toppled onto us at anytime because of all the traffic of large platters of food being passed next to our table.  We made a reservation but had to wait an additional 30 minutes.   It's pretty busy on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I visited this location for brunch with 5 girlfriends for my birthday. Service was great and the food was delicious. They gave me a coupon to use for a free dessert on my next visit and they gave our table lemon cookies to celebrate. They have a $2 mimosa special on weekends for the month of January, so we enjoyed many of them, Lol. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoying a crisp Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc with spicy calamari. Rene' is a charming waiter!"}
{"text":"Fancy Buca di Beppo"}
{"text":"I had prom here and made a reservation for 20+ people. Service is pretty okay but what's my favorite part is the buffet/ family style deals. You really do get a bang for your buck here! That's saying a lot for the strip"}
{"text":"Great customer service from our waiter Pete. He was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  Portions are so big you can share. Great authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from finish to end. Service is great and plates are worth the price. Good for sharing. Only bad thing I can say is that the tables were really close to each other."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this Italian restaurant located in Fashion Show Mall. I was not aware this was a chain restaurant until my wife told me. I wish they had one in San Diego, but the closest one to us is in Orange County at the South Coast Plaza. I ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces, basil pesto and marinara, evenly distributed over the dish. The amount of ravioli was bountiful. I was barely able to finish it and when I did I was really full. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs which she had no problem finishing.  We tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy. I think there was an hour wait. And this was on a Sunday night. This is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall.  The service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready. No big deal, we were not in a rush. Even though I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, this one is worth a try."}
{"text":"Another chain restaurant where we decided to check out the Vegas branch. This was a very large location, with a fun view of the strip. Service was attentive and friendly, and our food was fine- definitely edible, but nothing special. My peach bellini was my favorite part."}
{"text":"This is a very classy Italian restaurant located at downtown Summerlin. One of the best reasons to come here is to get the bonus second dinner to take home. You pay for one pasta dish, then you can pick a second different dish to take home at one price!  The happy hour is also pretty awesome, the flat bread is only four dollars and it is huge. The pasta is delicious, cooked al dente with fresh sauces. The cocktails are also excellent. I get the moscato Mojito which is a delicious twist on the original.  It's not too sweet and just strong enough for a happy hour treat."}
{"text":"You have to try the Maggiano salad. This had to be the most delicious salad I have had in a long time, and I am not a salad person. The peach Bellini is delicious. The homemade bread was excellent. I got the bow-tie aglio chicken special which was good but a cream sauce really would have made the dish better. The orecchiette and scallops are excellent!"}
{"text":"I was in-between 4 and 5 stars on this one, but I had such a good time, I bumped it up. 

The wait was a bit long, but decent considering that it was a Friday evening in Vegas with no reservation. This place is not expensive, especially for what you are getting.  Also, it has a much nicer feel than any other \"family\" Italian eateries without being stuffy.

Once seated, we received pretty good service with a smile.  I wasn't able to try the bread that was complimentary, but everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it.  The apps (calamari and zucchini) were delish.  At some point in the evening, we were serenaded by two men playing instruments.  I have fond memories of Steve singing along, lol.

Everyone also seemed to enjoy their pasta dishes.  This place serves everything family style, so if you don't want to share, be prepared to take a doggy bag.  I ordered the pesto linguine with chicken and it was DELICIOUS.  Warning:  you should REALLY love pesto to order this dish.

We were WAY too full to have any dessert, but the options sounded promising.

Tip:  They have skinny cocktails if that's your thing.  I had the skinny sangria and it was yummy.  Too bad it didn't matter with all of the food that I inhaled!"}
{"text":"My Nonna and I came here for lunch and we were so impressed with the customer service. All the staff were Uber friendly and attentive towards our needs. The food was very good as well, although it didn't leave as much of a lasting impact as the service did."}
{"text":"Great service at Maggiano's I'm incomparable to any local Italian restaurants.  U must have their staters chicken Italian sausage flatbread dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette"}
{"text":"A very nice place. The foods and deserts come in great variety."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite restaurant! Our server, Deven, really made the whole experience perfect. The food is outstanding and the prices more than reasonable. I'll be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"One of the worst bartenders (handle bar mustache about 25 yrs. Old) ...ever. Left bar for 15.min... Never cleaned up empty glasses, plates... Worst cosmo ever... I had to order and extra shot of vodka and it was so small...didn't take the clue that the drink was weak and dark red for a cos. O, dead give away. Never once asked how anything was.... Carbonaro was very good... Its a shame..  I had to ask for a setup and never offered pepper for. My cream sauce pasta."}
{"text":"Well, not sure what happened to this place between our last visit in Dec to now.  We were expecting the same quality of food on Easter as we had on Christmas Eve.  Very far from it.  We all did family style which was probably a bad choice.  The eggplant parm is not good even the wait staff will talk you out of getting it.  They slice the eggplant way to thick, hardly any cheese and way way too much sauce almost like they do not want you to find the eggplant.  we did not take any eggplant home, it was actually disgusting.  We also had the chicken picatta which you should be able to cut with a fork, you could barely cut it with a knife it was very very very dry.  Now we get to the Country Style Pasta which I named Garlic in a bowl, way to much garlic so much so you could not taste anything except garlic.  I sent the bowl of Garlic back only to get the four cheese raviolis which were also not sure way to much salt and just not edible not matter how they serve it.  I think they definitely need to get a new chef as all the food came out with no soul to it, like the chef was mad or did not want to be there.  The only good part of the day was the appetizers the stuffed mushrooms, the spinach salad and the tomato caprese but hey how can you mess these up.  The desserts were also good the apple crust with ice cream and the cheesecake was a little less savory than last time.  All in all we paid over $100 for appretizers and desserts since all the entrees were disgusting and pretty much unedible.  We will not be going back to maggianos and folks beware this place is hit and miss.  They need a new chef and new manager.  The wait staff and bus boys are great. As for the sauce it was way to acidic and tasted like they opened up a can of sauce and just heated it up, no spices and basically no flavor.  Maybe they should think about getting a chef who is actually from Italy as their chef last evening should have been fired."}
{"text":"Server Lorena was great.  She was friendly, prompt, and attentive.  Even with the hiccups with the kitchen, Lorena was gracious to ensure we had a great experience.

Food is not up to par for the price point considering the number of Italian restaurants and wine bars in Downtown Summerlin (e.g. Wolfgang Puck, Grapestreet, etc)  

I ordered the Linguine Frutti Di Mare ($25.50) spicy, it came out not spicy at all and the lobster was missing.  Our server did put in spicy on the ticket as the food runner had announced it as such when he placed it at our table.  Sent it back and Lorena got me a new dish right away.  Singapore Sling was delicious.  

Come here for fine dining prices and chain restaurant quality food."}
{"text":"This was my first time visit to Maggiano's and my wife and both found it exceptional! When we first walked in, I was thinking, this is going to be an expensive lunch, but it turned out to be very reasonable. Plus, you food was outstanding, and the customer service was awesome. We got the special for $42.50 which included two meals plus two take away dishes to eat another day. The meal came with an appetizer which we had some awesome mussels. Followed by lasagna and equivalent to an Italian stroganoff. (don't remember the proper name). Also, the meal came with a wide variety of dessert, and we had the creme brulee. Very good! Lastly, I took home spaghetti with meat sauce, and my wife took home egg plant parmesan, Will go back again. Hats off to chef and staff!"}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his 50th birthday on the 29th.  Not only was service terrible but the food was also not what we are used to from Maggianos.  Everything was super salty, we had the chicken parmesan and it was majorly overcooked.  Our waitress was not much to be desired at all.  I almost asked her if she was still on the clock due to her lack of presence.  Very disappointed, cost us $200 bucks for 4 people and none of us were happy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we sat at the bar because the restaurant was very busy and ere glad we did ... Outstanding service! To the food I had chicken & shrimp al forno it was outstanding my hubby had the lobster carbonara nothing left on his plate and he also finished mine ,no room for dessert but the people next to us had cheese cake and look delicious."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Consistently very good Italian fare. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all."}
{"text":"Brought mom here for her 80th birthday. Very very busy however Bill our server took great care of us. The food was great and tasty. Setting was great and the ambiance was quite Italian. We will be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Tasty Italian comfort food.

The prices are good, service is good, the menu has a large variety of foods and generous portions... you just can't go wrong with Maggiano's. If you're hungry and craving Italian food, this is a safe bet. The ingredients are good quality and fresh, and you always know what to expect. 

The atmosphere is nice... the red checker table cloths add a nice touch, and the music they play adds to the ambiance. 

I was sad when they took my favorite dish off (mushroom ravioli with braised veal, marsala cream sauce, and sundried tomatoes), but it wasn't too difficult to find other dishes I like. I particularly love their caesar salad. I eat a lot of caesar salad, and theirs is one of my favorites. I usually get it as an appetizer. 

One of my favorite restaurants, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was pretty impressive. The GF and I received a gift card as a gift so we decided to go check it out a couple weeks ago.  It was packed as we went on a Friday night, but after the experience, you can see why it was so busy. Great food, great drink menu, and the best service I've ever received. Our waiter, M. (I'm not sure if it's polite to mention names even if he was awesome) is probably the best waiter in Las Vegas: polite, charming, and honest. So many times waiters are told to say \"everything is the best\". When asked about dishes and wines that were not his favorite he would say that they were fine but he would really recommend Dish X or Wine Y. It helped a lot that his recommendations were spot on and he wasn't just trying to pad the final bill; a lot of his recommendations were cheaper than what we had first asked about

As mentioned, even though this place had a packed house none of the waiters or waitresses seemed rushed or hurried. The food was cooked perfectly, the view was amazing, and the experience was perfect. The GF puts this in her 'Top Three Favorite Restaurants' category. To directly quote her, \"I love it!\".  

I can't believe that this place is a chain. The set up is so nice; dark hardwood, dim lights, beautiful glassware.. It seems so against the whole 'Here's what corporate sent in a box, let's go throw this crap on the wall'. 

Easily a new favorite. If you happen to get a male waiter whose name starts with the letter 'M', be prepared. You might just get the best waiter in Vegas."}
{"text":"I always love coming here when I visit Las Vegas. The food is always good. I was a little disappointed that they have changed their family style menu options forcing you to choose a salad instead of two appetizers (my inner fat kid cried when I was forced into salad lol but it was a decent Caesar I will say). I did like some of the new pasta options that were added to the Family style options. The service is always prompt and friendly. Our waiter Robert was great! He managed to fit full length stories into the time it took to fill the water glasses, kept our whole table entertained. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food.  Good service.  Great for large groups.  We had 10 people and ordered \"family style\" and had more food than we knew what to do with.  I will continue to go here every time I am in V-town."}
{"text":"Bobby Taylor and I were waiting in the bar for a table so we could watch the game. We weren't the only one with this idea. We were first in line and three more couples came in after us. The fourth couple tried to take the first available table. We said we were waiting first. They got all huffy that it was first come first serve and if they could sit there before us then they get it. We said again we were trying not to bother the dude who was eating. They got pissed and left instead of waiting for  the next table. A older single woman came in and sat at the bar bc she felt bad taking a table ordering an appetizer for herself. We chatted about the game. What a lovely lady. The gentleman who was finishing his meal invited a second gentleman  who was only there to watch the game to sit as he was leaving. We introduced ourselves to him, Jerry, and said we were going to eat. He asked if he could camp out and watch the game as today was his 60th birthday. He was a snowbird who owned a restaurant on Long Island. We met a couple of his friends who were here to celebrate with him. The service from Joey (awesome female server) and Laura took care of us. The food was of the quality one would expect from maggiano s but with Marco s meal it was an awesome deal. The trip started off a little sour but was sweet by the end!! Go Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Came for New Year's Day. Can get busy. Make a reservation. Don't be afraid to ask if you don't see it on the menu. The chef can usually whip it up. Love the Chef K Lobster carbonara , chicken parm, Lasgana, bruschetta, tomato soup, and chocolate cake! Also have requested a broccoli, chicken, and garlic pasta. Wonderful!! Big portions. About $1-2 more per meal than your other Italian chains but so worth it! Stephanie was our server. Local girl who knew the menu and could manage her time and the crowd. Would love to have her again!"}
{"text":"Pretty much one of the best places in town for Italian food.  If you wanna do some shopping and get some grub, go to the Fashion Show Mall and find this place.  Greatest Lagasna you will ever have.  And their cheesecake is to die for.  Amazing service and the atmosphere is not stuffy but very nice.  Have a large party or want something more intimate, they pretty much do anything for you here.  And they even have private banquet rooms for parties!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the fetticinni alfredo here. Thats like my go to for italian resteraunts. The bread they give is good. Its like an upgraded Olive Garden to be honest (which I love). Decently priced, and across from the Wynn. Go here, youll like it"}
{"text":"Would have gone with 1 star, but our server saved it.

The hostess was downright rude:
\"How many?\"
\"Your name?\" (which she later got wrong)
Nod.

No, \"give us just a minute while we clear a table,\" no \"we'll be right with you,\" nothing. We stood in the foyer for nearly ten minutes looking at each other and discussing whether we should leave.
Finally the hostess called the wrong name and the wrong number of people, and pointed at a confused seater, who put the extra menus away and led us to our seats.
10+ minutes later a very nice woman -- who looked a little surprised to have an extra table -- showed up to ask if we'd like some water.

(She literally may have encouraged me to try this place again, once, for brunch.)

Food was decent but not spectacular, and therefore wildly overpriced. We appreciated that the chef sent out three complimentary bruschetta. One of our entrees got a thumb up, another a thumb sideways. At the end of the day, it felt like a chain restaurant with pretentions. All of which is fine, if that's what you're looking for.

On our way out there was another hostess working, and she couldn't be bothered to wish us a \"good evening\" until one of the women in our party waved \"bye\" to her. If this is what passes for \"fine dining\" in Summerlin...okay, I guess, but...you either need to step up your game in service or cuisine. Or, hopefully, both."}
{"text":"Maggiano's has been a favorite of ours for over ten years now. Unfortunately, the last 4 times we went we experienced awful customer service. We kept giving them \"one more chance\" because we loved the food, but ultimately we gave up and resorted to just getting to-go orders.

Now, I know carry-out is never as good as eating in the actual restaurant, but we adjusted our expectations accordingly and were quite pleased with this compromise.  Until tonight. 

We had a pretty simple order-
Chicken fettuccine alfredo, meatball sub, zucchini fritte, and a side of bread.

Strike 1: they were out of meatballs
Strike 2: they forgot the bread, although they did give us butter so I guess they thought about giving us bread?
Strike 3: I've literally had better alfredo at the Olive Garden.  
There was no chicken. There was no fettuccine. It was undercooked penne. And I don't mean al dente. I mean stiff and barely chewable. This penne was swimming in what I can only describe as some bland cheese milk. 

I gave two stars because the zucchini was amazing, as always. Except \"always\" isn't quite true either because they were out of the zucchini the last two times we had tried to order. 

I'm afraid my former favorite has finally run out of chances."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends to celebrate my bday. Nick our waiter is very helpful and another Filipino young gentleman assisted us. Our food was great they offer family style and let me tell you, everything was delicious. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch on Sunday. Beautiful new restaurant with a friendly waitstaff. Food was great- Chicken Picatta was on point. Even my daughter liked her lasagna and she is very picky. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here tonight celebrating my fiancé's birthday. I ordered mushroom ravioli and added lobster to it - 10/10 would recommend. Plus that came with a free entree to bring home, which means I have lunch for tomorrow too! The calamari was crispy and delicious. Everyone was very accommodating and it wasn't too noisy even though we were next to a big party. Also, the military discount makes a huge difference. Overall a great experience, nothing I'd change."}
{"text":"Everyone was great!  Was crowded tonight. Was told 20 minute wait for 3 of us plus a baby. Waited ten minutes and was seated.  Our waitress Arlouh was incredible!  Very nice as was all of the other staff.  Quick service.  Water and bread refilled quickly.  Food was amazing.  We had spaghetti and meat sauce, mushroom ravioli, and lasagna.  It was all delicious. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I am over the moon about this place! I've been here a number of different times and they consistently deliver. The food is so authentic but you can count on a tasteful spin to your traditional Italian dishes. My mom recently ordered the chef's special rigatoni and for once in my life, I saw her finish ALL her food. I have the shrimp and polenta and it was OFF THE HOOK yummy. Perfectly crisp and infused with an amazing lobster bisque sauce. To top of it off, they have the best soundtracks playing in the restaurant. Huge fan of this place and most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a big fan of pasta, but occasionally I crave it. Noodles are so comforting and are a welcomed change to crunching on bowls of veggies all the time. 

So Maggiano's was the chosen venue for a nice afternoon of grubbing, food pampering, and just plain stuffing my face. The restaurant site is unique on Scottsdale Rd where Bell meets Frank Lloyd Wright. The interior is pleasant with a 5-star staff in place. Friendly, courteous, customer-pleasing folk. 

The food however gets three stars. From what I know of pasta it should be cooked al dente. Well whoever decided what al dente meant would be disappointed with Maggiano's. My pastas came a bit overcooked and were only good because the ssssauces compensated. 

Lunch started with complimentary warm table bread and oil/balsamic dip. Yummy loaf. I could've made a meal out of it and found myself holding back from eating more.

Continued with three appetizers:
1. bruschetta of tomato with garlic and balsamic marinade ($1.95). Yes, more bread, but the crostini was so small it didn't count. The flavor of the topping was wonderful. Winner! 
2. mushrooms stuffed with breadcrumbs ($10.95). The menu says there is spinach and garlic in the stuffing too, but I could only taste buttery breadcrumbs. They needed some other flavor so I ground black pepper over them which helped - a little. Would not order the 'shrooms again. 
3. crispy zucchini fritté with side of aioli dipping sauce ($10.95). Who wouldn't want something crispy and oily sprinkled with parmesan cheese? Winner! The dip was great too. It made me forget I was eating mayo.

For my entreé I requested On the House Classic Pasta with take home dish ($13.95):
1. pasta primavera over angel hair noodles. Not as many vegetables on the platter as I hoped. The veggie mix was a couple of green and purple cauliflower florets, squash, and carrots. Not exciting at all. Once again the ssssauce was the hero - a good mix of cheese and marinara. Definitely needed the black pepper again, though. 
2. baked eggplant parmesan over spaghetti. This was a cold pre-made to-go dish which I ate the next day. It tasted good and sssaucy and I was glad the cheese didn't overpower everything.

Finished with the dessert sampler of 5 mini treats ($12.95) In order of best made to worst:
1. crème brûlée - this was my very first tasting. Unfortunately, the caramelized sugar crust was way too sweet for me. 
2. tiramisu - coffee came through strong. If you like coffee this will be a winner for you. I don't like coffee or tiramisu, but that's just me. 
3. cheesecake - just okay. Didn't really taste like cheesecake so I wasn't turned on like usual.
4. Gigi's butter cake - the plainest in the sampler. I would have rather eaten more bread.
5. apple crostada - minimal apples and covered in sugar. Yuck. Loser! 
I would not order the sampler again.

Bonus treats:
1. chocolate truffles brought to table by the chef (complimentary) - Wow! How do you say, cuckoo for truffle balls? Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate...rich and smooth, not bitter at all.
2. lemon iced moon-shaped cookies from the waitstaff (complimentary) - Meh.

Overall, the afternoon was definitely worth the visit. Relaxed dining; service was perfectly paced. No one rushed us to order or finish up. Maggiano's is worth another visit in the future."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food all around but the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite out of any restaurant. I will go just so I can order them as an appetizer."}
{"text":"When I found out that they do banquets here, I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The service was as good as it gets...period.  The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful, and the result was beyond fantastic!  From the appetizers, to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert...this place rocks."}
{"text":"I've been to Maggiano's a few times when I lived in Chicago and was not overly impressed. The pasta never wowed me, but their salads did.....at least they used to. 

I ordered the entree size Maggiano's salad. The iceberg lettuce was swimming in salad dressing and it did not come with the crispy prosciutto as mentioned on the menu. My husband ordered the smaller version of the same salad and they were the exact same size. They put his in a small bowl and mine on a plate. I felt a little ripped off. If you get a salad ask for dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is really good and reasonably priced.  Service has always been excellent.  And now, you can get the best wines by the glass!  I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Took the fam there a couple of weeks ago.  The food was very good.  The service was outstanding/top notch!"}
{"text":"Date night stop

Really enjoyed the atmosphere, romantic, beautiful views and friendly staff. The food on the other hand was just ok, especially for the price.  We began the night with a spinach dip appetizer then we got our bread 10 minutes later. My partner ordered the center cut filet which was good, and I ordered the shrimp scampi, although there were plenty of shrimp, angel hair pasta is not my fav. But that was my mistake I should have ordered the linguini. Especially since the waitress informed us that we can build our own pasta dishes since there kitchen was \"scratch\" so you could mix and match. Overall good experience but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Maggiano's in the Fashion Show Mall knows how to consistently produce high quality Italian fare. Over the years, I've eaten here many times and have never had a bad plate. 

Their Holiday Season menu adds to the variety and decent wine can be had at decent prices. I had the braised ribs off the seasonal menu and they were extremely good. Likewise, the cab off the holiday menu is a decent $50 bottle...and they give away a branded carafe for using the menu.

Tip: for easy access, use valet parking on the north side off Fashion Show Dr. then hop into the exterior elevator for a quick ride to the restaurant."}
{"text":"A year ago I would've given five stars but there's been a change in chef and manager and I don't know if it's been good.  Mind you we visited the second week of the new manager change so it might get better.  Still pretty good but they sent the wrong thing home with us (hubs went to get his lunch pasta out of the fridge in the morning and they'd wrapped up the appetizer we had left and told them we didn't want instead....oops).

I called back to let them know that hubs didn't get his second pasta dish and was told that I could come back and get it.  I told them we lived a bit far to do that....and then the manager just said that we could stop in any time and just ask and they'd give us one.  Nothing above and beyond.....and considering we'd driven there I didn't think that was cool.  When you have to go back to get something THEY forgot I think there should be additional compensation.  

So, I went online to their corporate site and let them know what happened.  They made it better!  They offered another dining experience on them to give them another try.  I don't understand why the local team wouldn't offer that given how many choices we have in restaurant options in the Phoenix area!  Also I am pretty sure that the OLD staff would have handled it that way.

I go because they are great about making a lot of the menu gluten free if they can.  There is a gf pasta option which you can put with most entrees.......except the lasagna's and ravioli's, manacotti's etc.  So the filled pastas are not offered in a gf option. (score one for Picazzo's here).

They also USED to offer a gf bread choice as well.  You had to pay for it but I don't mind that....now they don't even offer it.  Ugh.  Okay, again I feel like a second class citizen as the rest of the table sits with the amazing olive oil blend with their bread!

I have had many of the Chicken dishes made gf.  I had the Masala this time and the Masala tasted off and was very brothy as opposed to saucy.  My garlic mashed potatoes which I subbed for the pasta side were excellent and the creme brulee was superb.

I have had the lobster carbonara which is very good as well and not a bad price for the amount of lobster you get.  Overall I am appreciative of their gf offerings and I hope this new team gets better so I can enjoy going there again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Monday with a party of 5 and it was outstanding!  The waiter was polite, quick and professional.  The family style dinner was more food than you could eat in one sitting.  The Braised Beef Contadina was the favorite of the night and should not be passed up.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I try to live by the phrase \"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all\" but my negative experience here has really been bugging me and it's based on things that are completely preventable so I feel the need to point a few things out. As someone who put myself through college by working in the service industry, I have no patience for lazy and rude servers and it really irritates me when I go out to eat somewhere and am treated like I am an inconvenience for the one serving me. That's how I felt here. Our server was a young woman who from the moment we sat down was so nonchalant and unaccommodating that it made me want to leave within a few minutes. She didn't write anything down and came back to our table twice to get the correct order because surprisingly, she couldn't remember it all. Our food took an extremely long time and by the time we got it, it was luke warm and SO salty. I only took a few bites of it and told my fiance that we needed to leave. It then took us another 15 minutes to wave her down to get our check and all she did was place it on our table and walk away. Not even a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice night\". In the 15 minutes we waited, I looked around to observe the other servers and noticed one woman in particular who looked so annoyed at everything that was happening around her. She would literally roll her eyes while walking away from a table and push other servers out of the way to get to the bar well. This made me so uncomfortable just being around her. IF we ever eat here again, it will be to-go. I will never step foot in this restaurant again as a result of the extremely poor service and morale of the employees there. It was sad."}
{"text":"Service is always good.  Food is consistent.  I love all locations, this one is the best in Las Vegas since it's closer to home and off strip.  Never had an issue."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Italian restaurant whenever I am near the strip or shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. This restaurant can be both casual and fancy at the same time. Either way, they are welcoming; but the wait time can be long so I recommend getting a reservation if necessary, especially during weekend nights.

You get complimentary bread in the beginning after you order, but don't eat too much of it because the dishes are pretty big. I have ordered the \"Famous Rigatoni 'D'\" couple of times and the \"Peppercorn-Crusted Sirloin\"; they were both good! The Rigatoni can get really heavy because of the Marsala cream sauce, but don't get me wrong, the flavors are all there. The mushrooms & the chicken go really well with the pasta and the sauce.  
Last time I went, I got the Sirloin cooked as medium, but it was pretty chewy so next time I get that, I will be sure to get it medium-rare. I had to cut them into little tiny dices to get through them. The garlic mash potatoes that were on the plate added a nice touch to the sirloin. 
I never have room for dessert when I eat here because the proportions are pretty big! But it fills me up so I'm not complaining. The waiters are all so kind here, but the noise level can get really high, especially if there is a large group of people sitting in the middle celebrating a birthday or whatever. Besides that, I've had pretty good experiences with Maggiano's!!"}
{"text":"We have been to a couple Maggianos before. We love the brand because the food is always good and their family style option is great for large family's is great. The amount of food and quality food make it great for the price. It's endless so you can get as much or as little as you want for no extra charge. (Bottomless) service was good, they were great with accommodating my 2 year old. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I booked the reservations for party of 7 at 8.30 PM on Saturday (8/1). We were 2 families and one of the family was running late. One family party of 4 (2 Adults, 1 kid 7 yrs and 1 (2 yrs old)) arrived at 8.32 PM. They went to the host and asked for the reservation which was under his name (me). The hostess was reluctant to have them seated after requesting 2-3 times stating that they will make everyone seated once all the parties will arrive. What kind of customer service is this? Finally getting impatient as 2 yrs old was cranky i had raise my voice and asked for the manager. Then finally at 8.50 PM they got us seated - my friends family arrived 5 mins later. This in appropriate for a business like Maggiano's - the host should have been trained on the behavior on how to interact with the customer. I wouldn't recommend Maggiano's Las Vegas due to its poor customer service in dealing with people specially families with Kids. Thereafter the service was phenomenal - waitress were nice - Food was great too. But initial experience was pathetic....."}
{"text":"can't believe it's a chain caz looks really fancy a restaurant. friendly staff and delicious pastas. I don't really like seafood but the seafood pasta here is just too great that I couldn't resist to taste it lol"}
{"text":"We get family style and then roll out of the place stuffed to the gills.
Fried calamari is excellent.
The mushroom ravioli we're fought over.
No one liked the salmon.
Chicken parmesan is a decent rendition.
The fra diavlo was good but could have used more heat.
Creme brulee was good.
Family enjoys the cheesecake.
Been a few times and servers have been pleasant each time and when we had a repeat she recognized us (not sure if that is a good thing or not) and welcomed us back."}
{"text":"Aside from the box pasta they use I enjoyed my time here.  We made a reservation via Yelp and was immediately seated upon arrival :-) The food was so-so.  The lasagna was dry and the linguine with clams sauce did not stick to the pasta.  I'm from Chicago and this maggiano's was not great."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place.  Everything from the service to the lobster carbonara were very satisfactory and thoroughly filling.  I would definitely be back and recommend the place to others.  The portion I took to-go for the next day held up as well.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Dropped off food without silverware. Had to flag down another waiter to get some after about 5 minutes. Once main course arrived, the order was wrong. This was corrected right away, but we weren't even comp'd our 2 cokes. Table was severely wobbly. Glasses looked dirty but were actually badly etched and in need of replacement. Food was okay, but not as good as I remember it being in locations in other cities. Probably won't bother coming back."}
{"text":"I felt very welcomed and my Server Adam was amazing. My significant other and I went on our date night here and we both felt very comfortable, which is not always the case since we are a gay couple! The manager checked in us several times and our server was very attentive. The portions are quite large and the food was amazing. Thank you we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i haven't been to maggiano's for about 5 years.  but it still has the same solid food.  

*this location is inside the fashion show mall*
*they only serve the dinner menu...no lunch specials*

we came for a light lunch at the bar at 1pm.  maggiano's actually fit the bill because we shared the following: a italian toss side salad and an order of spaghetti meatballs.  hubby had beer on draft which came in a tall (but skinnier than usual) glass.

italian toss side salad - we opted for the side salad portion simply because we didn't
      want leftovers.  romaine lettuce, arugula, red onions, tomatoes, croutons,
      peppercinis with a light viniagrette dressing

spaghetti meatballs - rather MEATBALL, no s.  it was a big meatball though. 
      spaghetti was a smaller portion than expected.  however, it was perfect for our
      purposes.  i love to add red pepper flakes in my pasta.

the lady working the bar area did a great job taking orders, serving, etc."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday around three, it was very pleasant.  The fondue app is amazing...our party also ordered lasagne, baked ziti, calamari, kid Mac and cheese and tiramisu.  All were delicious.  The bread is also very good, and the bar drinks are strong!  Our server was very attentive and efficient.  She was well tipped.
The place was a lot less crowded at three than at later times; that's a good time to go there."}
{"text":"What a great menu, excellent service too. Would recommend the family style for any group over 6... We were able to try a little bit of everything. Everything from the chicken to pasta to seafood was great! I am used to NY Italian, and this place was very good in comparison."}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker for lunch a few weeks back. had heard really great things about it. The appetizer we ordered was the smoked bacon with ricotta cheese on bread - highlight of the meal it was fantastic and our waiter had recommended it. I ordered ravioli and it was pretty average (I think CPK and Lavo have better). Service was excellent and it was pretty busy at the time. Will maybe come back but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Quality food,
Large portions.
Really great prices. 
The people by the bar are what you may call riff raff.
This is def not a special occasion kind of place. It is very casual.
Hungry on a budget? Come here."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a strip view. The mushroom ravioli with shrimp and Alfredo was excellent. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and wasn't over stuffed. 1 con- entrées do not come with a salad. They offer a family style menu or individual dishes. Even without family style, the portions are quite large and could feed 2 at least."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good. Had some concerns it would be the run of the mill corporate Italian joint. But the food was excellent. Service was slow. We had a large party so I'll accept that it was going to be a bit slower than a two top. But it took 40 minutes just to get the wine out, and the kids meal that was supposed to come out way early in our four courses came out well after entrees. 
For the price I won't go back with a large group. Two or three people may be a better bet."}
{"text":"It was horrible. We haven't been on a date in a while and we thought this would be a good place to go. We were ignored the whole time. The waitress didn't refill our glasses the whole time until the end when she gave us the check. The wait was really long especially for a Monday evening just to get our food. The portions were small. The waitress didn't give us our bread when we asked or the vinegar. Overall really bad experience. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Ate here with my family for my mom's birthday. It was wonderful. Staff was friendly and accommodating, and the food was delicious. For appetizers, we ordered calamari and bruschetta bar tour (my fave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Honestly, if it were just me, I'd order five of the bruschetta bar tours. My parents loved it. Mom had linguini and clams, and shrimp scampi for my dad. I got the pesto perlini mozzarella. It was great, but I preferred to pick off my partner's plate. He ordered the gnocchi & italian sausage. Perfect amount of spice meatball."}
{"text":"Great dinner, the portion was huge and I couldn't finish it.  Our waiter was top notch and I enjoyed myself.  Recommend reservations."}
{"text":"The wife and I came for a low key Italian dinner after walking the strip. We were sat right away which was nice. Our server was beyond excellent. The food was just as good. This place was exactly what we needed after a long day."}
{"text":"We have eaten at numerous Maggiano's over the years an normally they are consistently excellent; not the case here.  Service was really bad and food was mediocre at best. Salad had rusty spots on the lettuce and the soup was not hot and didn't taste very good. Bread was cold and ravioli sauce had a film on top from being over cooked. Management needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"I used to like Maggiano and think it was one of my favorite Italian chain place. However, I have not been back to this place for at least 3 years because there are so many Italian restaurants in town. I came back last night for my friends bday and found out they've changed their menu quite a bit. I guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky. I wasn't completely satisfied. 

I was surprised that they don't have any pesto sauce on any dish. They also took away the half/ full size. They only have one size for their entrees  now where it's more for individuals rather than sharing. I guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides.

After I sat down, it took the server 10 minutes to bring me some water and then another 5 or 10 minutes to take my drink order. Even though I was the only one who arrived in our table, I was bit annoyed by it. The server was friendly though. I wasn't sure if they were under staffed or he's just keep forgetting about me. 

I was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried. We tried fettuccine Alfredo, gnocchi and Italian sausage, and shrimp scampi. Alfredo sauce was not creamy enough. I like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked. I don't think I will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, make sure to park Valet on the northeast corner of the mall and take elevator. We made reservations and was seated promptly. Our server, Seidi was unbelievable and offered great suggestions. She made our party feel very welcomed. Food was great!

Recommendations:
App- zucchini sticks
Meal- Chicken Parm
Des- tiramisu"}
{"text":"One star for great prices. The second star for great food. We started out with bread which I thought was very fresh. The Calamari appetizer that we ordered came out fairly fast and was really good. The four cheese ravioli was fairly good and I am very picky when it comes to eating ravioli. It could have been better with more sauce. The third star is for the price which isn't bad. The fourth star goes to the atmosphere which i thought was very clean and well decorated. Minus one star for the long wait for the table and not enough waiters."}
{"text":"Dined here with a party of 10 for my birthday. The family style dinner was quite an experience, and a pretty good bargain considering the amount, quality and variety of food. Service was very attentive and the Peach Bellini incredible! Loved the swinging background music, not loud enough to be intrusive, but loud enough that you could not hear others' and you could talk without bothering others. A great time! Especially enjoyed the Caesar salad, mussels, cheese ravioli and the apple crostada."}
{"text":"I've been to Maggiano's a number of times, and I have not been disappointed yet.  The calamari is delicious, as are most of the pastas on the menu.  My biggest complaint is the price.  Even though the food is good, I really don't feel that it justifies the high price tag.  There are a number of basic pastas that you can get for less than $15, but these are bare bones dishes.  While still good, you're going to have to spend $20-$30 per dish if you really want to experience what they really have to offer that makes them great.  The atmosphere at Maggiano's differs between restaurants.  The Maggiano's in Denver has a much more classy, and quiet environment with great ambiance.  The Vegas location is much more noisy, usually overcrowded and the service much more casual.  Here's a few tips; make a reservation online, and in the comment box request a booth."}
{"text":"We were told that for party of 8 they will have to take us in for a group/family price (I forgot the exact term they use about $35 per person with courses to choose from)...Yes, it's a little PRICEY but the food is so abundant and delicious, everyone is sure to be full... Will come back again."}
{"text":"What an awesome dinner!! Our waiter Raphael was extremely knowledgeable and had great dinner suggestions!! Portions were very generous!! Delicious and filling!! Would definitely recommend and return when we come back!!"}
{"text":"We love Maggiano's!!!  They have a great happy hour during the week and the bar area is relaxed and quiet.

There is an old man who looks like the Six Flags guy walking around playing violin and he is the coolest old little dude ever!!

Our favorites are the stuffed mushrooms, spinach salad (amazing dressing), and the tortelluca dish.

Everythig we have every eaten here is tasty.  You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat their special that is in their classic pasta dishes... get one and the chef treats you to another one to take home!  I have to say the Four Cheese Ravioli makes me salivate just thinking about it.  I swear, next time, I am going to get the ravioli for BOTH dishes!  I can't wait til we get to go back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Maggianos tonight n everything was 5 stars!  The food, the service n prices!!  I highly recommend dining at this great establishment!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever make a reservation for this place they don't honor it... Way over rated in a mall no doubt...."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here today for the first time. Food is amazing!!! Had Lobster Carbonara, Sausage soup and Mini desert sampler. All were great and no complaints. We ate on the patio and it was a nice view. Our server was wonderful and we are going back tomorrow to try other menu selections."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's in Charlotte.  The amtmosphere alone makes it a pleasure.  On top of that the staff a friendly and quick to make suggestion what is good on the menu.  Menu has a wide variety of item to please just about anyone.  If you want to get a table would suggest making a reservation.  Deserts are not that large, however definetly pack with plenty of flavor.  Their Cheesecake in my opinion is better than Cheesecake Factory.   Excellent choice for special events or a networking luncheon.  You can even dine ouside on the patio during certain times of the year.  Overall a must for the Foodie inside us."}
{"text":"Excellent service, highly recommend this place.. people nice and friendly.. the stake is really good in this place.."}
{"text":"The family style meal is amazing. It allows you to try different menu items. The ravioli, Rigatoni D and the chocolate banana bread pudding were favorites. It was my birthday lunch and they gave me a really nice dessert plate. Plus the chef antipasti is worth the whole trip. Loved the view of the Strip. The staff is friendly and attentive. I always have a special time."}
{"text":"We dined here last night with a party of 10.  Ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed.  Brandon took very good care of us the whole night.  We were never rushed and the food just keep coming.  The chopped salad was great along with the stuffed mushrooms.   Dinner was eggplant parmesan, salmon, chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent.  One of our diners had some dietary issues and they were VERY attentive to her.  Dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie.  Everyone in our party was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter and Joanne from NY waited on us. She was great and patient with my indecisive family. Food was amazing as always, always recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pasta was so depressing in look and taste, ended up giving just 1 star. I ordered vegetable pasta with penne wheat pasta as substitute. Pasta was highly undercooked, almost raw. I requested extra veggies and was charged 4 bucks extra for that, but i did count the veggies in my pasta and there were exactly 8 cauliflower pieces and 1 single piece of zucchini (or just the zucchini outer skin) I showed it to our server and he told manager. Manager came up and did offer desert on the house and we did have tiramisu, but somehow there was miscommunication and server was unaware of the fact that desert is on the house because pasta was really really inedible(specially for an expecting mom). The worst thing is I still ended up paying full amount for the pasta and extra money for invisible but so called extra veggies in it. May be people like this place for fine dining, but wont suggest my friends to go there."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with friends! Decent wine selection. 
On my last visit i was a little disappointed with the bartender. I asked for a vodka Gimlet straight up with fresh lime. I was given a shot of vodka in a rocks glass over ice with a lime tossed in. First off, a gimlet is made with lime juice, not just a wedge. It's a classic simple cocktail that all bartenders who are working in an establishment that serves more that beer and cheap college kids drinks should know. When i passed it back to her and explained the drink I was then given the same drink but she had squeezed the wedge that dshe had dropped in. She fished it out with her fingers, squeezed and dropped it back.  I said to her, \"straight Up\", she looked at me and said \"yeah, straight up!\" Seriously ? At the very least a bartender should know the difference between on the rocks and straight up before stepping behind the bar on a Saturday night!  Enough on that. 
The food was good, our server while a bit talkative was attentive and knowledgable of the menu which was nice. 
As a side, my daughter loves their little lemon cookies, we share an order while i sip an espresso."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had in Vegas in a long time! My husband and I were born and raised in Vegas. We are always looking for new delicious places to eat! When we were kids we would hang out at the Fashion Show mall a lot but Maggianos was a little bit out of our price range. You definitely get what you pay for. Large portions, great service and amazing desserts!!! We had the most delicious creme brûlée I've ever had! The tiramisu was also delish!! The only complaint I had was the bread . It is very traditional oil and balsamic dipping bread but my husband always prefers garlic bread. Just preference. I love bread either way! :))) I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Had a great girls night out tonight! Also received the best service and had amazing yummy food. Overall great first experience. Our server was very attentive and super nice. I however thought the place was a little small and the bar was secluded from the rest of the restaurant.. However, I really recommend trying the chicken parmesan, Alfredo fettuccine, and the shrimp scampi. All amazing dishes!!! Also had a caesar salad for an app and thought it was just mediocre, could have used just a little more dressing."}
{"text":"I work across the street and we order lunch often to take back to our desks. The food is usually delicious and my favorite is the rustic chicken and shrimp al forno. Just make sure you check your order if you pick up; they tend to lighten up on the amount of meat in your dish. They got us again today with two pieces of shrimp  and some small pieces of shredded chicken (we had three orders of the rustic). So we will order at the many other restaurants neighboring Maggianos next time."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  But you have to get there early, just like in any Maggiano's, to get the best seating and the best service.
Arrived Saturday evening, around 5.  Not too crowded yet. As a single, I sat right down at the bar, watching some basketball.  I asked a passing waitress for a menu and she sent over one being held by Gabriel.  Gabriel was awesome; very friendly, always asking if I needed anything and was super nice.

I ordered the Tilapia.  It was golden brown crusted and tasted okay.  Loved the capers and mushrooms included.  I probably should have gone with the salmon dinner.  I felt the tilapia could have been cooked a little more on the inside and been more flavorful.  But I was also given a basket of delicious bread.  I ordered a virgin peach daiquiri and it was excellent.  And my cup of tomato soup was good as well.

Overall, excellent dining experience.  I hope to return when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect:

Early evening, pre show light dinner.  Starting with Sis-in-Law's Lemon Drop and my Peach Bellini - which I received as requested, on the rocks instead of frozen.  While the Lemon Drop was excellent, Sis had a little Bellini envy going on, for sure.

We had a calamari and shrimp appetizer which was plenty big enough to share and was served on a colorful bed of greens with a light dressing.

Sis had the Caesar Salad + shrimp, which she has had before and loves.  I went for the Spinach Salad and it was perfect, no need to add anything, as bacon and pine nuts were liberally applied.

Service was excellent and happy.  Great location + Great food = Great dining experience"}
{"text":"went to dinner last night at this well known restaurant.  As is usual, the wait was between and an hour and an hour and a half.  After about an hour, we decided to eat in the open seating area of the bar as many others were doing.  There service was s...l...o...w!    i could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and was extremely busy. it took 15 minutes just to place a drink order.  by the time the food came we had been at the restaurant for almost 2.5 hours.  The portions were huge which i think is compensation for marginal italian.  I was not impressed with this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Been here many times they have THE BEST linguini and clams, the best the best bread, best service especially Sylvia!

 Tonight  I was very surprised my veal Marsala completely burnt overdone crunchy and hard looked blackened maybe the chef forgot about it and it caught in fire?  I showed my waitress she looked as shocked as me, brought it back then....magically the next time it was done to perfection a  different color and texture- the chef was sincerely sorry.

I will return, stick to my linguini."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on 11-14-15 about 8 PM.
Seated fairly quickly- party of 6 Birthday Dinner
Our server was Joanne- she was pleasant, knowledgeable with the menu and very attentive to our needs.
Ordered Caesar Salads to start. Good, Crisp light & refreshing!
Kids cheese raviolis - good portion for the price
Gnocchi with sausage- really rich & was very Devine!
Veal Parm was HUGE! For $26.75 at least two meals in one!
Always look forward to dessert- Creme Brûlée it was soooo worth it. So delicious!
Wonderful food, great birthday and good service!"}
{"text":"We were planning on eating someplace different until our car decided not to work.  

It was fortunate that we were staying at Encore and decided to walk across the street to the Fashion Show Mall.

We tried to eat at Grimaldi's and we walked all the way over there only to find out that it's only pizza now.  We walked around and found Maggiano's by the entrance we entered when first got to the mall.  We looked at the menu and figured it looked good.  We went to the reception desk and were told it was an hour wait.

I asked about the bar area and was told it was all open seating as long as everyone in the party was 21+.  We walked back to the bar and found a high table to sit.  After 10 minutes, we were greeted by the smiley Nicole.  She said she would be our server and took our drink order.  She brought our drinks back, then disappeared for 20 minutes.  We wondered what happened to her since she seemed like a good server.

Well, Nicole stopped by and asked if the other server had been by to help us.  We said no, so she apologized profusely and said she would take care of us.  Thank goodness she did.  Nicole is a very good server, attentive, and responsive.  (There was a miscommunication between her and another server as Nicole was going to hand us off to the other server).

After the mix-up was cleared up, Nicole gave us top-notch service the rest of the evening.

I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and replaced the spaghetti with rigatoni.  It was a very good dish and I almost finished the whole thing.  My friend enjoyed her linguine with clams in white wine sauce.

Overall, a very good experience at Maggiano's.

Xie Xie!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food and great service.  The Lasagna there is amazing!  I mean, it just melts in your mouth.  We even had our rehersal dinner there and having everyone together eating family style with great food just made it a very special evening."}
{"text":"My hubby took me here for dinner. There was a 45 min wait but well worth it. Nice place, turned out to be very romantic. We had a small table right but the window of the strip. We had someone play a violin for us. The service was great and the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Don't come to vegas and miss a meal here. 

Visited September 2011"}
{"text":"Made a special reservation for my son's 21st birthday party.  The entire family flew to Las Vegas for this event. We have some food allergies and I spoke with the manager upon making reservations that our party of 10 could not order family style.  I was told that they would make an exception and let us order Al a Carte and that he would be sure to note it in the reservation. When we arrived they refused and said that they were too busy to accommodate us.   We ended up having to leave and went over to Don Vito's at South Point Hotel and had a delicious dinner that everyone could eat and thoroughly enjoy. Five Stars to the food and Service at Don Vito's!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My first visit was a few years ago after my brother-in-law said my husband and I HAD to go. I make my share if trips to Las Vegas and I go out of my way to eat at Maggiano's. The decor is very nice. Love the dark wood and old Vegas pictures. The look of the place gives an impression of a much more expensive restaurant but I think the prices are very reasonable compared to some other local restaurants. The service is always great and I've always enjoyed everything I've ordered. My favorite is the Tuscan Sausage and Orzo soup, I order it every time! A must for every Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"We had numerous small issues and a couple of major ones that ended up making us not want to come back, all related to service. Small stuff-forgetting kids drinks (had to ask a food runner about them), ignoring requests for ice, only one drink refill in a 2 hour period, one of the entrees was pretty bland, time between salad and entrees was very long, even for a Saturday-our kids ate their entire meal while we waited on our entrees. Major stuff-absent server, our \"take home\" food came out when our entrees finally did-and sat in the heat on the patio for over 45 minutes while we ate, and waited...waited...waited on our server (FOOD SAFETY ISSUE). When he came to take the food to pack up to take home he stacked dirty silverware on top of leftover food (from a different plate) that was supposed to be packed up, and dumped one plate of leftovers onto another plate. That was disgusting. He finally came back to ask if we wanted dessert (we had 2 kids wanting their ice cream and both parties at the table got the Marco's meal-um, yeah, we wanted dessert). He gave us the menu and didn't come back for another 10 minutes, by then I told him we did not even want dessert. After waiting for the check for another 10 minutes with server nowhere in sight we finally got fed up and asked for the manager. Politely explained the issues, and also told him we would NOT be taking that food home that had sat in the heat for so long. He said he would \"take a look at the check and see what I can do\". Then we waited some more. When the server came to pick up the check, we told him we were waiting on the manager before paying and he tossed the check down on the table and said \"sure\" sarcastically, turned and walked away. At that point I was DONE, and I left my husband to deal with the check and the rudeness, taking our kids out to walk the mall. My husband stated that the manager never came back but the server did, demanding to know what was wrong, etc. and telling us all the to-go food was frozen and should have been fine (it has not been frozen when we previously visited, nor had any other table gotten their to go food prior to when they were clearing entrees and getting their checks. When the \"adjusted\" bill came in, the manager had taken a whole $8 off our check and $5 off my parents check. We feel that not only was the service TERRIBLE at a restaurant that charges $20 per plate, and that the manager totally blew us off-not ever coming back to the table and leaving us to deal with the server. Our previous visits had been fine, but now I have no desire to return to Maggiano's anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"At Maggiano's, the portions are huge, and we've always found it is more economical to order several dishes and share rather than ordering off their family menu.

This location is at one end of the Fashion Show mall (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rXUBAFqrr00KvVEJ6aNURw?hrid=OYsZi4R_-xj0UuVtTe5vPg).  The non-smoking section has a Strip view; the whole place feels very airy with lots of windows.

{"text":"Came here for dinner and both of our dishes was amazing! The lobster carbonara and beef parpadelle was so good! My dish was a nice portion with a good amount of lobster- tiramisu was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Slow food and crowded but the food is great. It's  hard to find at the mall and the restroom is upstairs . Not the most convenient place but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"This place has a look and feel of Old Italy. I have never eaten in this area and there are quite a bit of restaurants surrounding each other.  We chose the family style service as we had about 6 in our party and it was well worth the $$! We had the salmon with balsamic glaze, chicken franchese ( my personal favorite ), shrimp scampi, tossed salad, tiramisu, creme brûlée... I am missing a few items but those are the ones I enjoyed! The food was cooked perfectly and the taste- maron! Yummy. It helps to have good company. Our server was knowledgeable and very welcoming.  Definitely will come here again :))) it's a bit pricier but the good ones are. Go! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here for my last meal during my Las Vegas trip and I am pleased to report that it was a great decision. My mom, sister, and I walked on over here from the Wynn and after a few hours of shopping, we were pretty stoked to eat. The salad was a bit heavy on the dressing, but my lasagna was a delicious monster of a thing that went straight into my belly. Also, they give FREE BREAD. Nothing beats free bread."}
{"text":"I've actually been to Maggiano's a few times and when I did it was amazing!  The food, the atmosphere, the service was phenomenal!  However, this review will be on my recent visit, just a couple days ago.

Me and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job.  In the beginning, everything was fine.  We ordered our appetizers and... that was it?  He didn't ask if we'd like an entree after taking down our appetizers.  So, we waited for our server to come back and ask if we'd like to order an entree.  After he gave us our appetizer and even finished it, all we saw  him do was helping every other customers but us.  Did he have something against us because we \"look\" 16 years old and can't afford an entree???  After about 20-30 minutes of waiting, we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree we've been waiting for.  He comes over and he goes, \"Okay go ahead.\"  He didn't apologize for making us wait.  REALLY??  Wow.  I'm appalled by his performance.  And after we got our entree, he only came over to us twice, third time being check, and we never saw him again.

The saving grace to our experience was the food.  Our appetizers were the Zucchini Fritte and Stuffed Mushrooms.  I loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great!  Our entrees were the Rigatoni D and Chicken Parmesan.  He enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well!  The little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat!

We're always going to come back here.  Just not have that older server again."}
{"text":"I recommend this pace 10/10! They have gluten free noodles and all their sauces are gluten free! Their tomato bisque was the best I've ever had too! The service was friendly and knowledgeable. They had a chef come out to take my order for my allergies. Will be going back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We were invited here for a vacation express trade show for a company travel event and the food was rockin and kept on coming! The staff were very friendly except for one person, but you can't fault an establishment on one person.. great place for an event!  Highly recommend, very cool they have valet parking and of course being part of South Park Mall didn't hurt either.. very nice!"}
{"text":"What can one say about Maggiano's that hasn't already been said? The food is spot-on delicious and the service is always top-notch. 

We stopped by for some pasta on MLK day and were shocked that it wasn't packed. I ordered the Smoked Brisket Cannelloni and it was divine. The waitress recommended the dish and she was 100% on the money. Tender, melt in your mouth, perfectly smoked brisket wrapped in smoked mozzarella cheese and topped with Swiss chard and bits of summer squash surrounded by perfect marinara sauce.

My fiance had the Chicken & Spinach Manicotti, which I sampled and admit was also awesome. The meal was awesome as was the service. Then we topped off our lunch with the Lemon cookies. If you're a fan of lemon, as I am, these cookies are for you. 

Maggiano's is your place for spot-on, 100% Italian dishes. Plus you get to listen to some Frank while you dine."}
{"text":"Chose the spaghetti and eggplant entrees.  When you buy one you get to chose a second to take home.  So basically you get four meals for the price of two.  What we had was good.  Also ordered tiramisu.  That was so so."}
{"text":"This restaurant was such a delightful surprise! My Mom and I were in the mood for Italian but weren't prepared to spend more than 25$ each for pasta. We found this on Yelp and the reviews were great, so we decided to give it a try. We arrived after 8 pm, so it wasn't busy and we didn't require a reservation - although I can see it being busy earlier in the evening. We were walked through the restaurant to the very end, and were given a beautiful strip view table. It was great! We were promptly served warm bread with oil for dipping, and made our selections off the menu. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and my Mom ordered the Mushroom Ravioli. Both of them offered lighter options, but with all the energy we expended all day walking the Strip, we decided we deserved the full calories. My mother has a severe nut and seed allergy, so we informed our waiter - who directly brought out the chef to discuss her dining options. Never before have I experienced this level of consideration for allergies in a restaurant. The food was brought out quickly, and was absolutely delicious. It was probably the best food I have had on the Strip for such a reasonable price. We devoured all of the hearty portions, and were totally stuffed. We were then approached about desserts, and were offered the NUT FREE house made brownie. We did not have the room for dessert, but we will be back for the brownie another day. Our total bill for two meals and one soda was only 42 dollars. Amazing! Top marks here!!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant.  The prices are very comparable to other restaurants in downtown Summerlin and is very clean.  The food was excellent.  Was able to get a spot at the bar without a reservation on a Saturday night.."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not great! The desserts are another story though! The new york style cheesecake is out of this world! So is the tiramisu! Not to mention, all the desserts are made in house. Talk about talent. I could come here and just eat desserts all day long. The decor is amazing, actually feel like you are in \"Little Italy\". I wold have to say my favorite dish in the chicken and spinach manicotti, it is so heavy, filling, creamy and cheesy! By far, the best on the menu. Cute for a date night, wedding party or baby shower since they have banquet rooms you can rent out, even for a reception. Staff is always nice and friendly, the atmosphere is lovely."}
{"text":"Came for a bachelorette party dinner.  There was about 10 in our group and opted for the family style menu.  We chose the classic menu which came with a choice of 3 appetizer or salad, 4 main courses, and 2 desserts.  From what I remember, we had the calamari which was amazing, the bruschetta which was also amazing, and the maggiano's salad the salad was pretty good.  For our main courses, we had the chicken parm. I was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded.  We also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin.  This dish was really good. The meat was tender and the flavors were good.  Along with our meat dishes, we ordered baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo.  I enjoyed the baked ziti but the fettuccine alfredo was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together.  The dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy. The creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind.  There were so much food that we even had tons for left overs.  Everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in. 
 The service was very very very good.  The host was able to hold our table even past the 15 min hold time because our party was so late.  Our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken.  She was attentive but not annoying.  She approached our table frequently but not too frequent.  Drinks were refilled  before they  even reached half way.  Overall, it was a great experience.  I would recommend this place for big groups who has a budget because to be honest restaurants at Vegas can get super expensive and not everyone can afford them.  Would I come here again??? Of course!! I am actually planning on having my family  bday dinner at the one in LA."}
{"text":"Girls weekend and this was a great find. Walking distance from hotel. We made reservations and it was packed but we were seated quickly. Bread and dipping oil was brought to table. Our waitress was the best. Spaghetti and meatball, chicken parm and cheese ravioli were so good. Drink recommendations were a hit. 
 We will return!"}
{"text":"While the food is excellent, the server we had was personable and fun, the portions are a bit smaller than it used to be. The pricing has gone sky high! 
The place is like you are packed like sardines. Can't move much at all! Servers bumping into people who are seated (I was literally knocked on the head)! 

When they bring you the check, it is no longer in the \"leather\" folding things, it comes in a folded paper! How ridiculous! The server said, people are dropping them, tips are being lost, credit cards are being dropped constantly! How safe is that and unfortunate for the servers to lose tips because of the cheap folded up paper with your check! If you sit at the round table by the door to the kitchen where they put the menus in, the staff slams them in the holder and it is honestly uncalled for. I haven't heard so many breaks happening in the kitchen as I did last night. But then again if it bumper to bumper tables, it is probably close quarters in the kitchen too. The place needs revamped. Need to be more spread out and take some tables away, at least then your customers and servers can walk around easily! It's not like ya'll are hurting business wise!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and excellent food! Get a reservation, they seat you within 5 minutes of your time. Trust me, there's always a wait. The Marco's Meal for 2 is a steal of a deal. You get an app, entree, dessert, and a take home entree for $39!! The Ziti is delicious! Perfect for an anniversary!"}
{"text":"We love the newest Maggiano's location!  We were the devotees that trekked to The Strip to eat Mamas Lasagna but now are thrilled that we can dine closer to home."}
{"text":"We love the food at Maggiano's  I will start with that.  Last night's experience wasn't very good.  We thought we would sit at the bar and have a drink and then dinner.  The bartender was less than impressive.  Eryka was busy speaking with an employee's dad and other employees while we had to ask if we could order a drink, and ask if we could order dinner.  She laughed and said oh you just have to let me know you are ready I don't want to bother you. She kept calling me hon (I'm, 65 but not down and out!) I felt like we were at a local gambling pub or something not at a nice dining establishment.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here and they had no problem seating us when we arrived 2 hours earlier. The staff was very friendly and waitress provided great service. The food came out quickly and we surprised with the large portions. Everything tasted really great too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Italian food for amazing prices, considering it's on the \"Strip\". I had the Crab and Shrimp Cannelloni ($15) which nearly brought a tear to my eye because it was so delicious. The pasta was made fresh and cooked perfectly, the sauce was fairly rich (made from Asiago) and creamy, and the contents of the cannelloni were superb. Washed it all down with a Peroni on draft. 

This may be a chain restaurant but you'd never know it. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went for an early (4:00) dinner on a Saturday.  Was seated right away by a polite and helpful host.  Waiter was very personable, helpful with suggestions, and attentive throughout the meal.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer looks so decadent because it looks like the mushrooms are swimming on olive oil or butter, but that is actually chicken broth so you don't have to totally kill your diet to eat them.  The eggplant parmesan was good but only order it if you understand you're going to get something that looks like lasagna.  When they say it is baked, they mean as in a casserole.  Different but good.  Even so, I still consider the lasagna my favorite, though.

Lots of parking because of the location in Downtown Summerlin.  Just try to avoid the area where theater-goers tend to park."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been going for a couple of years and I am always satisfied! The customer service is always so pleasant, the food is fantastic and its not too spend! My boyfriend and I go here at least a couple of times a year.

I always brag about this place to my family because I know they would love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my family. I usually stick to the places I like but we wanted to try something different this time. 
Let's start off with WOW, I felt fancy coming here. Everyone treats you like royalty. From the Frank Sinatra music to the ambiance, this place is perfect for a date night. 
For the entrees, my husband and I shared the Johnnys Carbonara. I must say, I was very much pleased with the flavor. I love how thick the bacon pieces were in the dish and how the sauce didn't have the bottom dripping oil like most places make it. The portion sizes are huge here so you'll always have left overs. My mom let me taste her spaghetti and meatballs. I love how you can really taste the flavors of the seasoning in the entire dish. It tasted like a home cooked meal where love was put into it. Again, this portion fed 3 people. Glad we got to take some home! 
For the dessert we were recommended the butter cake and the New York cheesecake. Both blew me away. As pastry chef myself, I could come back here just for dessert when I have a sweet tooth. Everything I tried at this place did not disappoint me at all. Deven our server was very polite and on top of everything. Excellent customer service all around from the very beginning when we walked in. Thank you Maggianos for making my 1st experience with you all very pleasant."}
{"text":"Our group of 19 had dinner here tonight. Notwithstanding our reservation and that it was confirmed by us a week ago, they did not have our table ready because they said they called today and got no reply. Dah - we weren't in our home city!  We were traveling at this location. But once i let that go, I have to say service was excellent (Andrew was our server) and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD. 


Seriously, from the service to the food and the atmosphere everything was amazing. It was a party of 4 and we ordered family style which means we get two appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 different entrees and 2 desserts. It was a total of $150 for 4 people with amazing bread to start off our meal, also the drinks were comp off of the check since we ordered family style (can you say great?) Will definitely be back here soon! Only regret was not going in sooner. Lol"}
{"text":"Service here is GREAT. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar to eat Alex & Wes the bartender were amazing. My borfriend order Chicken Parmesan and Loved it I order Braised Beef and wasn't really satisfied wasn't enough beef very Bland but amazingly they let me order something totally different and I got a free order to go home. They gave us some really great wine recommendations and sangria recommendations and we're totally spot-on and knew exactly what they were talking about. Would definitely come back again and sit at the bar just to talk to Wes and Alex."}
{"text":"My experience with Maggiano's was terrible. Our first impression was of the host, a young man with a very snooty, rude attitude. We were there on a Monday night and asked for a table on the patio. His response was \"the server already has 7 tables out there and I'm not giving her another\". We had Crystal as our server. She was less than pleasant, not smiling or friendly at all throughout the entire meal. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. It was terrible. The eggplant was a mushy mess and the pasta was very underdone.  My honey had the spaghetti with meatballs which neither of us cared for. My daughter had the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Hers was the best  meal of the three. We will not return to Maggiano's and would not recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times over the years for birthdays,  anaversary, mothers day and they always try and make special ocations a little more special for you.  Have always made reservations when I'm going here and they always seat me right away when I get there. There desserts are so delicious  (have to try the dessert sampler) and food is good but on the pricey side. The staff is always really friendly but the decor really need an update mostly in the restroom (outdated tile, sinks,  stall walls dirty and faded,  lighting facing every direction and very dusty) have seen better restrooms at service stations. Only other thing I can think of is every now and then I get a dirty glass or utensils but staff is quick to replace. Over all for the money it could be updated."}
{"text":"Awesome people, attentive and fun waiter.  Great food. Chef even came to table to see if our food was to our liking.  It was my sons high school graduation night, so it was important for to be a celebratory atmosphere and it was great.  Highly recommend an will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"We love Maggianos Little Italy.  We used to go to the one at South Coast Plaza it is awesome! But now that we have moved we are closer to Las Vegas Maggianos is at Fashion Mall across from Wynn.  They do a great job even being crowded! Food and service are great! You can park right under the mall and there is an elevator to take  you to italian heaven!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's
- Its Happy Hour is NO LONGER AS GOOD AS BEFORE (now 3Stars on my book), although still a great
4-Star restaurant for dinner.

YELPY DETAILS:
- This nice mid-scale restaurant is
conveniently located on the strip nearby the lively fashion mall district. It used to be my favorite spot for HH on the strip. It has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around, with a good selection of drinks and excellent service. But my wife and I just had an unsatifying HH experience there recently.

- One early Fri evening inmid-August, mywife and I came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that:
(1) They NOT ONLY took away our favorite \"Fried Zucchinis\" from the Happy Hour Food Menu,
(2) BUT ALSO, the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of ONLY ONE ITEM, i.e., Flatbread! Luckily the flatbread was delicious.
- Well, my wife and I used to bring our out-of-town guests here for happy hour and dinner. The place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the PAST, especially during its happy hour. But, on this Fri evening (around 5:30pm),the bar area was PRACTICALLY EMPTY, with only 2 tables occupied and only ONE customer at the bar counter! We thought it could have a lot to do with the now VERY LIMITED HAPPY HOUR MENU, our nice and efficient waitress agreed.
- Well, one more good point: We were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread FREE, which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oil/basamic vinegar!

BOTTOM LINE for HH:
- Due to the diminished value and the \"Empty-Space-Atmosphere\" (on a Fri evening at that!), I'd now give it only 3 Stars for HH.

On the other hand, to be fair, just back in March, we brought friends over there for dinner (NOT HH), we did have a fabulous time, with tasty dishes, drinks and superb service! So, we wish that Maggiano Management would do something to bring back their popular HH menu and fill its place again for HH!
- Hints: Please put back \"Fried Zucchinis\", and perhaps even add \"Crab Cakes\" to its Bar Menu, which is a GREAT HIT on Schottsdale Maggiano's HH Menu anyway!
- Until then, I could still go there for a good dinner, but will not likely go back there just for happy hour.

Peterskis, August 2012"}
{"text":"Overall, I think that Maggiano's is a very solid place to eat. The food is really good! But for $30 or so a person, I wouldn't say that it was _especially_ good. For that price, you're usually going to be getting some really awesome food. If you came to me and told me that that is what you're lookin to spend, Maggiano's wouldn't jump out at me, but I would say that it is a solid choice.

The rissoto bites stand out to me as awesome. Also, this may be random, but the balsamic vinaigrette also stands out to me as awesome. The red sauce is good. Chicken parmigiana is good. Deserts stand out as awesome. Especially the apple thing we got (see pictures).

One reason in particular I'm not giving this five stars is because the pastas with white sauce felt rather bland to my girlfriend and I. We thought the red sauces were much better. That isn't just because of a preference for red over white sauce.

The service was great. What you'd expect at a nicer restaurant, although credit is still due.

They offer you the option to take pasta dishes home with you for only like an extra $5, which is a really nice perk."}
{"text":"You would think big beautiful restaurant on a holiday with a pre-fixe menu would be a slam dunk. Not so much, we arrived for our reservation and were seated right away. We were seated for about 5 minutes before our server was able to get over to us. While she was getting our non-water drinks we noticed that 4 of our 7 water glasses pre-set on the table had dried on food residue and lipstick stain present. We made our server aware of this on her return and she apologized and quickly replaced the empty glasses with filled clean glasses. As we sat there she made us aware of our thanksgiving menu options and it seemed fairly straightforward. She made us aware that the bruschetta would be our right away. Imagine our surprise 20 minutes later when our salads arrived and our appetizers had not. The salad choices selected Italian Chopped and Classic Caesar, both were a bit over dressed resulting in lettuce that was a bit wilted. No biggie just a salad, we still had plenty of courses remaining. Our appetizers arrived and to say they were disappointing would be an understatement. The bruschetta bread, usually the unsung hero of the entire bite was dry and stale. The diced roma tomatoes and artichoke options both tasted as a kindergarten culinary school drop out had made them, and still failed. So at this point we are very excited to receive our entrees and notice that several of our knives on the table also were soiled with thick encrusted build up. We at that point made the server aware. She of course once again was very apologetic, and stated she would alert a manager right away. Sixteen minutes later the manager pops up and offers a half hearted apology for the dirty silverware. He asked if there's anything else he could do for us, we requested several refills and expressed concerns that our server maybe overwhelmed. 

-No response-

Our refill drinks arrived and surprisingly we never saw the manager again. 

Our food has now arrived and we are giddy with excitement, after two lack luster starter courses, surely the entrees would not disappoint. The turkey, very tender and juicy. The accompanying giblet gravy was a perfect compliment. The sausage dressing however was severely undercooked and tasted like mush. The brown sugar ham and whipped sweet potatoes, just like grandma used to make. The Rigatoni D, that is usually mind blowing was served with pre aldente pasta, and a sherry cream sauce that was severely unreduced.  The four cheese ravioli reminded me of a slightly elevated Chef Boyardee. 

The saving grace of this meal was truly the pumpkin cheese cake. With a ginger snap crust and a creamy filling with a hint of spice. Simply incredible. 

At the end of the day, we would've been more satisfied and less impacted financially if we had just gone to Golden Corral. 

Next year, i'll cook at home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Maggianos last night for the first time. We walked in around 8:45 and were seated right away. The atmosphere was very nice. Our waiter, Ervin, greeted us right away. We were very impressed with his knowledge of the menu and how personable he was. He recommended the Shrimp Diavolo, which is what my husband ordered. I got the Chicken Pepper Flatbread. Both were wonderful. We really enjoyed our visit here and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was good. The cheese ravioli was my favorite and their brownie and ice cream was delicious."}
{"text":"So sorry , It's  hard dropping from a 5 to a 3 , but food is life , and my last couple experiences haven't given me life . 

My favorite salmon is just subpar lately , and I just for the life of me can't figure out what happened? What happened to the robust Alfredo my daughter oh so enjoyed ? Get it together, I would like to revisit and experience that magic there once was in every bite . 

However,  I must stand by the great service from the wait staff to management,  maybe get more experienced chefs?"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place at the recommendation of several friends who eat there a lot and boy was I disappointed! The service was AWFUL and dish after dish was underwhelming. My dish had herb roasted chicken (not much of it though) that tasted like rubber and the sauce was so thin the pasta was actually floating in it. Overall there was little flavor and I didn't even want to take it to go. 

With so many great Italian good options in Charlotte and I would choose to go to any of them over Maggianos. I'd even rather have Olive Garden! Do yourself a favor and save the time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and we had such a good time. I ordered the surf and turf dinner and the filet was cooked to perfection!!! While we were waiting for our food someone came and sang a birthday song to me and really engaged with our table. OMG the truffle bread is to die for!! All in all, it was a very good experience and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is an old school red sauce Italian chain restaurant.   Usually, I use them for meetings -- their private dinning space and budget friendly menus are great anywhere in the USA.  

But this visit I found myself in the Fashion Mall on the Vegas strip.  I wasn't in the mood to shop nor did I want to pay $6++ for Starbucks so I went into Maggiano's to grab a coffee.  It was between lunch and dinner and the bar was empty.  I bellied up to the bar and ordered my 3 shots of espresso and read my book -- sometimes I find relaxing spots in the most unlikely places.  

The bartender was friendly but kept her distance as I wasn't in the mood to chat. Plus the off-hour diners kept her busy.  I had to leave before my coffee was finished so she gave me a kid's sippy cup so I could take my coffee to go!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is one of my favorite North Scottsdale restaurants.  I love the Salmon Oscar and all the waiters & waitress are terrific!  Our favorite being Jean,  My concern is not so much the food as it the wait...  We go about twice a month and have noticed now that the winter visitors are back in town even with reservation we were told it would be another 30 minute wait after our reservation time...Thank goodness a nice manager from Denver just happen to be there and immediately got us a table after the hostess had told several other customers with reservations the same thing!  I explain to the manager that we come in the summer when we are always able to get right in but to \"BUMP\" us for 30 minutes past are reservation time in busy winter months just does not make good business since.  I also felt sorry for another couple who told us they were told 30 minute wait then after 30 minutes were told another 30 minutes.  

Please don't bump your local year round clients for the drop ins from out of town...My suggestion would be to either hire more staff & open upper level, or  keep your customers that do make reservation to a 10 minute delay at the most...even if some tables are empty for 10 minutes.  You will want us in July...keep us happy now!


YOU HAVE  GREAT FOOD,  I just know we meet several customers who were just as upset as us about making reservations and being told we still had to wait another 30 minutes...  Shout out to the manager from Denver who was there to resolve issue!"}
{"text":"Overall, I agree with the vast bulk of the other reviewers.  I found the service to be friendly, prompt, and attentive.  My only major complaint was the Chicken Saltimbocca had full-sized sage leaves under the crust on the chicken breast.  Biting into one of these and eating it was akin to eating a car pine air freshener.  Don't get me wrong I LOVE sage (it's a big reason why I ordered that dish) but a more deft hand would have used it to advantage not like an assault weapon."}
{"text":"I'm glad we made it here on our last day in Vegas as we went on Thanksgiving to find it was a set meal and we weren't interested.  The restaurant came recommended so I had high expectations and it didn't disappoint.  The restaurant is quite large and when we arrived between 1-2PM, it was busy but not crowded.  We went to the hostess stand and almost immediately someone came to show us our table for 4.  I sat in the seat facing the bar area and had a view of a TV if I wanted to be entertained.

The menu had what sounds like great pastas, salads, sandwiches, and flatbreads.  I usually get the Linguine di Mare with lobster, shrimp, mussels and calms but this day, I decided to get the shrimp scampi thinking it might be less food for me to eat.

Our server was friendly and happy with a smile but not annoying.  He was great to bring us bread, mmmm, warm bread and poured the oil, and brought balsamic vinegar to include.  It was a great start to a delicious meal.  It didn't seem we had to wait long for our main seafood meals.

The portion size didn't disappoint (I had asked our server if they had half portions but nope!) There was about 20 shrimp and on top of a large plate of angel hair pasta.  My husband helped me eat the shrimp but it was too much pasta for me.  This was a delicious meal and at under $20, it was a deal too! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant was great. The waitress was super proud to be working there and was not shy about making recommendations. 

The lasagna from the special menu is good but the traditional lasagna is better. 

We ordered the bruschetta sampler and it was fantastic with a lot of different flavors. 

The happy hour is amazing 3 dollar beer from 3-6"}
{"text":"One of my top fav restaurants. Food is always full of flavor, the bread is amazing, our servers are always checking up on the table, and even on a busy night, I can still sit down and have a comfortable dinner with whomever I go with. Always a top choice when I'm debating where to go eat for dinner"}
{"text":"Went here  on a Friday afternoon for lunch. Wait time was not bad, in fact we were seated fairly fast. Greeted by everyone when we walked in, so no complaints on friendliness.  Place was clean and well orginized. 

Ordered

Chicken fettuccine alfredo with asparagus. -  Great flavor. 
Mushroom Ravioli - so so. 

Overal this place, to me, is comparable to olive garden. Nothing too mind blowing, or distinguishing. Would much rather pay the price at a Tony Romas. Customer service was better than expected. Not a bad try at all."}
{"text":"Normally, as a Vegas resident, the last place you go for a good time to drink is the Strip. Sure, it's great for all those vacationing there. But if you live there, you know that you can save the Strip for the tourists. Maggiano's Little Italy is the exception to this.

The happy hour is one of the best that I've experienced in Las Vegas. Boasting $2.50 appetizers and well drinks with $3 premium drinks and beers. This place is a great place to stop after work. You have to get there somewhat early or be forced to wait outside. The dining area is a bit cramped. But it's best just to situate yourself at the bar.

The appetizers are tasty and not of your typical bar flair. I usually favored the calamari and tomato mozzarella. Free Italian bread with Vinaigrette sauce make it even more delectable. All the better to wash down the drinks with. 

With the main dining so close and the tunes of classic jazz standards overhead the ambiance can be busy. But it never seemed to escalate over a dull roar. So keeping conversation is never a problem. Along the walls are classic pictures of \"Old Vegas\" and it's easy to get stopped along the way to the restrooms and take in these old photos as if you were in a museum. 

The bartenders pour a mean drink and remember the locals well. This isn't an easy feat when you serve as many drinks as these guys do. Each bartender has their \"specialty\" drink but don't push it down your throat. Ask bartender \"Chris\" about his Poma-tini. It's a pomegranate flavored martini that is refreshing, smooth, and very drinkable.

Sadly, I've never had a full fledged meal there. The happy hour was always enough for us. I have indulged in a slice of the cheesecake, which gives the Original Cheesecake Factory a run for it's money. The filling was smooth and creamy and the strawberry topping tart and sweet. And the best part was the price. Only $5 for this massive chunk. 

Maggiano's Little Italy inside the Fashion Show Mall is outstanding and I recommend this place to any friends who are visiting.

The only think keeping this place from a Five Star Rating is the fact that it does get very busy and sometimes the bartenders tend to lose track of you. 

Four Stars for:
Great deals
Strong drinks
Super Hour
Tasty appetizers"}
{"text":"Reception dinner was exceptional.  Event fee was confusing (still tip??...I did). That being said, the service was exceptional, and very accommodating.  Food was delicious, especially the salmon...chicken maybe a little dry.  All guests left happy.  Good choice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian chains around, but it does not feel like a chain. Beautiful and upscale yet depicting Italian culture. Growing up in a northeastern Italian community I feel like his is the Godfathers hang out. Buca Di beppo is for the hit men. Maggianos has amazing zucchini fritte and calamari, and I love the Nona's for desert. I also love the eggplant parm and the veal and mushroom ravioli. It is a little steeper than some, but the family style options are great for a party."}
{"text":"I usually come to Maggiano's if I want decent Italian food. Not anything amazing like you would find in other cities. I have noticed that the only difference of lunch and dinner are the prices but the same portion? Very interesting. Usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but I really could not tell the difference. The party/family style is definitely NOT worth the price. I do admit that Maggiano's is probably not even comparable to Bucca but still they overprice their food too much when I could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business. It doesn't help that it's on the strip. The service is great! Make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations! The portions are great but the quality...hmm....I'm the type that prefers quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Ask to be seated in Nestor's section.   He directed us to the perfect entree and wine.  I told him I wasn't very hungry and he suggested the perfect seafood and pasta dish ( seafood di mare). The best dinner I have ever had, period and I have traveled most of my career.  Service was impeccable.  I will fly to Las Vegas just to eat here.  Great Italian atmosphere and food.  And Nestor was the key!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is definitively a favorite of mine for Italian food. The quality of food here is phenomenal and very filling! 

The gnocchi is cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The Linguine di Mare is the winner for me here. Huge plate filled with clams and shrimp and pieces of lobster. Absolutely delicious and a gold mine for seafood lovers! 

My boyfriend and I had the Chocolate Zuccotto cake here and it was incredible. Layer after layer of chocolate although not too sweet, it was perfectly glanced and not overwhelming. 

The only tick I have with Maggiano's is that they don't know how to do reservations correctly. I have reserved here twice only to show up and be told a 15 minute wait time that turns out to be 30 minutes. 

I understand that the restaurant is busy, but the point of a reservation is to have the table ready to go by the promised time. Service is absolutely everything and Maggiano's outperforms in other every are of service except their reservations. It gives you a bad start to your experience and it could very easily be avoided by making reservations effective."}
{"text":"Have been for lunch and dinner and have not been disappointed. Looking forward to more visits. They make my favorite pasta dish (spaghetti with red clam sauce) here and it certainly did not let me down. So much flavor. The bread served when you sit down is fresh and delicious, and was made even better with the oil and vinegar blend served alongside (the italian way, no butter necessary). Service was excellent and the food was hot and fresh.

Atmosphere and music were just what you would expect from a fine Italian restaurant.

No complaints here."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in our visit this time.  Asked for a table up front when I made the reservation a month ago, but was given a lousy table in the back.  Told them it was a birthday, brought in my own cake as was allowed, and they brought out the cake in my Tupperware and dumped it on the table.  How embarrassing.  Didn't they think to put it on a platter and add birthday candles to it?  Also, no one came to sing, which they have always done in the past.  And our server Tracey had an attitude all night.  And I had even requested her when I made the reservation, as she'd been wonderful in the past, but this must have been an off night, because she had a bad attitude and seemed to be doing us a favor to serve us.  She also was never around when we wanted her.  Service was extremely slow.  This was the 3rd year in a row we went for my daughter's birthday dinner, and it will be the last.  Very embarrassing, uncomfortable and unpleasant, to say the least.  What was supposed to be a great, happy night, turned into a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Very delicious Italian food. Great views of the strip. Get a table by the window! Could do without the random serenade guy walking to every table to get tips for singing to you, but it is a unique touch. Very enjoyable experience in all."}
{"text":"I always stop by Maggiano's when in Vegas and the rigatoni D ($16.75) never disappoints.The description for the frutti di mare ($21.95)  which is  pasta with lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and spicy lobster tomato broth sounds delicious but it isnt as tasty as it sounds. The sauce was too bland so I ended up eating half of hubby's rigatoni D. 

Recommended since it's pretty cheap for strip vicinity area and for their delicious rigatoni D. Rigatoni was overcooked last time but the sauce used in the dish is always wonderful."}
{"text":"I did my birthday dinner here on Saturday and was really blown away by how they were acting. I had a party of 20 and changed it to 18, due to some people being late. They told me I had to wait about 10-20 for them to set my table up. Then it turned to a longer wait! We waited for awhile before we were seated. When we were finally seated, we realized they kept us waiting for no reason when the restaurant was literally almost empty! Then a lady kept coming to our table, worried about two chairs being empty, because it could be used for another table. REMIND YOU THAT THE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY. She really started to get on my nerves over two damn empty chairs. Our waitress was sweet though. But overall, I wouldn't come back to this restaurant. My 5 stars for this restaurant dropped to a 1 star because of this experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Typical Italina food (or Americanized Italian food rather)."}
{"text":"Excellent service! We checked in, had a few drinks at the bar, and received a text on the phone that our table was ready.  I had the New York steak, my wife had the two lobster tails.  Both dishes were on point and delicious. Our waitress was attentive, and all i can say is, we'll definitely be back.. i highly recommend this place, but reservations are a must, as its very busy.. enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. I love the 3 cheese ravioli. Sometimes they can find you a bottle of Sparkling cider too."}
{"text":"We got a great view, great food and pleasant service. What more could I have asked for."}
{"text":"DON'T HOSTE YOUR BABY SHOWER THERE! The shower started at 2 and the food wasn't served till 315 while my guests are waiting, they came out with one plate at a time so appetizers didn't come out at the same time. Then I picked and paid for extra plates that also came out one at a time. We had the room till 5 but the food was coming so late that ran us behind. 

What's more upsetting is that they litearly came out with one plate of each item ordered, NO REFILLS! so don't believe them when they say they will refill because they won't. Then at 5 while we are still eating our ordered desert they stormed the room and KICKED US OUT. They said they have another event in 30m, which would have been okay with us to leave on time if they didn't run late on everything. 

Our event was also disrupted by a live band next door that they failed to mention it will be there, even though I called and emailed their banquet staff many times to make sure my event goes smoothly. It was the biggest regret for me to go there, one of the worst service, place to hold your baby shower. The food is good but it's not worth the aggrevation or treatment you will get."}
{"text":"I love Maggiano's.  I've been to Maggiano's countless times in days past, but I wanted to write a review for one reason and one reason only.  David...the amazing server that we had last week.  

David was so awesome!!  He made our dining experience a wonderful one, and when we go back, I hope to sit in his section.  The food that he suggested was awesome (huge portion sizes) and the wine he suggested to go with our entrees was perfect.  

Only negative is that is connected to the mall and next to another popular restaurant chain so parking was a headache.

Thanks David @ Maggiano's for being so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Ugh.  

I have eaten at Maggiano's a couple of times and I have NEVER had a good experience.  It was the same story both times - they tend to serve customers based on who looks like they're ballers.  I guess that means I don't look like I'm not balling out of control, because I always have to practically beg for a drink refill.  It makes me wonder what it is that makes them classify people that way... I was dressed in nice business attire... so did I look like a redneck or something?  Was it because I was young?  Either way, the Maggiano's staff needs to wise up:  you never know who someone is and how well they will tip by appearances alone.  Just sayin'.

The food isn't that great either.  During both visits, my fiancé and I ended up with pathetic salads, burned or under-seasoned entrees, and virtually no service whatsoever.  Both times, something had to be sent back because it was either made incorrectly or was disgusting.  Pathetic.  Get it together.

Is there something I'm just not \"getting\" that makes this place so special?  As far as I have seen, the elitist attitude from the servers amounts to jack squat.  They can't deliver on any front - food OR service.  This is another scenario where I really feel like you're paying for ambiance, and as I always say, I can't EAT ambiance.  

I know!  Maybe I should go be a baller at the local McDonald's - I could order the entire dollar menu and I GUARANTEE the food would be better than Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Not a bad chain restaurant with a bit of a hometown feel.  Portions are generous, prices reasonable, and service is friendly, makes this an acceptable place to go in the northern/central part of the Strip (Fashion Show Mall).

Ordered the Linguine di Mare (seafood), it's a decent dish with mussels, shrimp, bits of lobster with pasta in a tomato based sauce.  It's a huge portion but what's up with the tons of mussels?  Extreme dis-portion of mussels, which is more than half of the seafood.  I like mussels so that's ok with me, others may not be so happy.  The noodles need to be cooked longer in the broth as the flavors are not completely absorbed.

For desert, ordered the tiramisu, very light and creamy, with a strong coffee accent.  This would be a good choice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants out there.    Awesome Italian food, HUGE servings, good service, great atmosphere,  yummy desserts, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food and service was great . The meat sauce was amazing. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is we dined outside on the patio and the ash trays for smokers are rite there in front of the doors and patio. So we got to enjoy cigarette and cigar smoke while eating."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Excellent combo for 9.95!  First time and I loved it! Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She explained the menu to us since it was our first time. Definitely coming back. Our table was clean and fancy."}
{"text":"It was disappointing. To start from the beginning,we were waiting ,one of the waiter just was looking at us  and ignoring us. We didn't know where hostess was then we  found out  that she was in the middle of the restaurant. So we sat outside,view was good. Our waiter was kinda lost,he didn't know the menu good and he was pushing the specials so we got Chicken Florentine (specials) which wasn't good. Chicken was dry and tasteless, we also ordered Pasta with meatball and fried calamari.Sauce on Pasta  was too much. Fried calamari was perfectly cooked. Food came out fast. Paid for two $87 including one glass of wine and tips. I don't think I will go there again."}
{"text":"The salmon was good it came over a bed of spinach that was balanced with the steam from the salmon. The salmon was cooked to perfection and seasoned. We enjoyed the free bread with oil and vinegar. My husband had the Chicken Parmesan it was a hefty portion with two crispy chicken breasts and a bowl of spaghetti. The food was good and to top it off they have happy hour from 3-6 with $5,$6 drinks and food items."}
{"text":"My wife and came here with some friends for our wedding anniversary. The place is very nice and the staff was helpful, although it was quite busy so service was a bit slow.  We initially asked to be seated outside as it was a very pleasant evening, however, we found ourselves instantly swarmed with mosquitoes  I was left unscathed, but my wife and sister were practically eaten alive.  The staff was accommodating and moved us inside as soon as we asked but I have to wonder if this isn't a recurring issue.  I understand Phoenix is very dry and standing water probably isn't usually a problem, but it seems like an establishment with outdoor dining should be prepared for such a problem.

The fact that with many dishes you get to take home a second helping really takes the sting out of the price, which I found to be a little high considering the quality.  My wife, sister, and friend enjoyed their pasta well enough, although I found my shrimp a la diabla (which doesn't get a second helping) to be a bit lacking.  The pasta was a bit overcooked and mushy, the shrimp was a bit fishy (though there was plenty of it), and the sauce a little bland.

All in all, not bad, but not great.  I'm no connoisseur of Italian by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm not sure I'd go back.  Perhaps, but not sure."}
{"text":"Yum! This is one of my favorite restaurants. I always come here for special occasions. Italian food is all up my style but this takes it to another level. I usually come with a big group so we get the family style so there is a lot to choose from. Some of the favorites are chicken parmesan, rigatoni D,and their chopped salad. A bit of variety but it sure is good. The portions are more than enough and the service there is very well done. I give it 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!   We booked our office Christmas party for 16 people and specifically requested to order off of the full menu.  The day before the party, they called us and said no, we MUST choose from a limited party menu.  The Doctor was unable to have the menu items he personally had looked forward to, they were now unavailable to him. This left us the night before the party, without a venue.  I was astonished that they would not accommodate us.  16 people is not a banquet for 100!  I'm sure they would have been able to prepare 16 entrees.  They serve hundreds every night."}
{"text":"Long wait on a Veteran's day weekend. Almost 2 hours wait!!! =( but the steak was good.. and the appetizers. Mozerella Marinara and the Center Cut Filet Mignon..yum"}
{"text":"So sad about Maggiano's closing. The pasta is great and I live for the garlic mashed potatoes. My husband loves the chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"Amazing food - The bread, OMG! The bread, it's warm, and addictive.  Moms lasagna is perfect, the 4 cheese ravioli melts in your mouth.
Great price about $15 a plate and well worth it.  Some of the best food I have had in Vegas for the price.  I was staying at the Wynn hotel, very expensive food, expensive does not make it good.  Walk across the street and have one of the best meals of Italian food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our one year anniversary and it was such a perfect place for a romantic dinner. He made reservations for two and when we got there, the table was ready and they were waiting for us! They had us sat at such a beautiful spot next to the window in front of the Wynn Hotel (which is always a sight to see!) 

We were immediately treated with bread and balsamic vinegar which was very good! The bread was warm and soft and they kept coming with them! And the balsamic vinegar was also so tasty! We ordered our food and did not wait more then 20/ 25 mins. But we enjoyed it because they had a man walking around playing the violin very beautifuly. We loved it. When we got our dinner it was very delicious and the portions were great! The price was also very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip! They had $14 plate all the way up to $25 dishes. But they had all the Italian classics and many seafood dishes (which was what my boyfriend had, and said it was great!)

I highly recomend this restaurant for people who need a good warm meal in a great, soothing atmosphere! 

The only reason why I gave Maggiano's Little Italy 3 stars was because towards the end of our meal the waiter was standing (not very far from our table) staring us down, waiting for us to finish up and leave. I found it a little rude and uncomfortable, but other then those last 10 mins it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Went ahead and stopped in to grab an Evening Dinner on 5-23.  The restaurant was wonderful in the setting.  Decided to eat at the bar very few customers within the establishment.

I sat at the bar after finishing my drink during the salad.  Then the meal arrived.  After numerous times of asking anyone that walked by for help (drink) the bar tender finally acknowledged my glass was empty.  This was extremely sad since she spent my entire dinner talking to the customer sitting next to me.  The dinner meal was also cold when it arrived.  I would not recommend this establishment.  Ended up giving the food to the dog so ver unimpressed with this locations customer service."}
{"text":"Im actually sitting in the restaurant right now and I have to write this review ASAP Bc just ugh.


I'm basing my review on the food. Our waiter was very good but the food was not up to par.

First off the bread they serve is par baked. So it's not fully crunchy or done. Bleh.

I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and I had super high expectations Bc it's an Italian place and they're known for cheese. They dip was 75% thinned cream and 25% spinach and artichoke! I don't know if the chef just ran out of ingredients but I am so not paying $15 for something so crappy! View picture for my struggle. The crostini was fine it could be sliced thin get but the dip was just HORRIBLE! They didn't make a thick enough rox or didn't add enough cheese to make the dip thick and they didn't put enough spinach and artichoke! How could the expediter allow this to happen? SMH I'm better off buying a FROZEN pack from Trader Joes!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is delicious Italian food at prices that won't break the bank. It's a nice atmosphere without being pretentious. The fried zucchini is delicious (they used to have asparagus that was even better), the family style menu is awesome, and the desserts are to die for.
They also have a great happy hour M-F 4-6:30 & Sun-Th. 8:45-10:45 with discounted drinks and app's.
Tonight I had Baked Ziti, and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"We've come here a lot. This was neither our best or worst experience : we have an allergy issue in our party and they always send a chef to discuss it but this time felt like he was in a huge hurry. It felt like questions were causing him to be late for an appointment.  Our server gave us the same impression. The food was lovely,  cooked properly, very tasty, so our less than stellar experience is entirely at the feet of the service staff"}
{"text":"Decent Italian place , I chose the pasta special, you get a 6x6 lasagne and choose another to take home and heat up. It was really good. As I was in a hotel this was a bonus and saved per diem $$$. The best part was my company paid ."}
{"text":"Great, amazing, delicious Italian food
The staff is so friendly. They call the chef to take our order because we don't consume pork or wine so he made a special order for us 
We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and our special order was shrimp and chicken pasta and shrimp marsala but without the marsala sauce it was freaking delicious 
Definitely I'm coming back to try different dishes 
Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof...at MAGGIANO'S! - La Roux (bulletproof)

Thank God this place was where i thought it was!! I remember seeing the wynn when i came here a long time ago from the windows since it is on the 2nd floor of its structure but you are never sure, especially since i was running on 5 redbulls for the day and had like 4 hours of sleep from the night before. It was so cold and we were hungry and i was leading us to this place that i thought was here and it was...yay!!! The portions here are awesome by the way..too bad its hard to keep leftovers when you are around in vegas - which is what happened to me lol. Anyways, ordered the lobster pasta and there was a good amount of lobster chunks in it. The side salad had a good portion to it too so i would recommend that if you want the veggies. The ciabatta bread in the beginning was tasty and wanted more. Wish i saved room for dessert, not possible here! Oof maybe next time outside of vegas.

Food: 4 stars --- Service: 4 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta and it came out \"warm\". I had them \"re-heat\" it, since I was kind of in the mood for a hearty Italian meal. Several minutes later my food reappeared and was a little bit \"warmer\", but not hot. This isn't rocket science, it's basically heating up food.  I will not return."}
{"text":"What a let down Maggiano's ended up to be. My first experience ended up being a horrible one. 

Come on now, you do not vacuum your carpet when you have guests who are eating!! Making us move to another table just so you can vacuum does not make it any better! I think I might have ate some of the dust. 

Besides that whole ordeal, the calamari was the best I ever had here. THE BEST! I ordered a chicken dish which was blah. KFC prepares better chicken. Its my fault though, ordering chicken at a Italian restaurant is like eating sushi at a buffet in Vegas, IT SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations from this place because I remember the food being delicious (5 years ago)! Our server was really nice but the food was mediocre! Very greasy and didn't look like the chef put any effort at all. Started off with calamari which tasted acceptable; the marinara sauce tasted so salty! My husband ordered salmon oscar and chicken frances for me, their food was covered in grease! And that's a big NO NO considering we paid for $90 for those meal! We could have gone some place cheaper and better. I probably wont be coming back anytime soon nor recommend this place to a family member. 1 star for the good service and another star because we didnt wait too long for our food."}
{"text":"Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because the cheesecake was heavenly. Everything else was a disaster; and this place deserves 1 star.

To start off... we had a reservation for 7:30. The reservation was for 20 people. (Yes I know serving 20 people can be very difficult, but it can be done... Apparently this is not something that can be done at Maggiano's.) 

When we arrived the hostesses needed an EXACT number of people who would be dining. That would be 20; hence the reservation for 20 people... This was about 10 minutes of pointless back and forth with the hostess and how many freaking chairs needed to be at the table. 20! SHEESH! 

The next run around we got was that we were not allowed to be seated until all of the guests had arrived. After some of our guests arrived a few minutes later we were still all standing in the lobby. We were told our table would now be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes of clogging up the front door and part of the bar area we walked up to the hostess and asked what the status was. Once again our table would be ready in 15 minutes. Another 20 minutes painfully ticked by. Oh did I mention we had a 3 month old and a toddler in the group? Anyone with a baby/toddler knows how great it can be waiting 45 minutes for a table. NOT! 

50 minutes after our reservation had passed we were called up to be seated. Not one of the 3 hostesses apologized or even batted an eye that we had been standing there for 50 minutes?!?! ARE YOU FOR REAL!?

Once we were seated we were understandably STARVING. Two waiters appeared to take our drink order. The young lady who helped was pleasant and very hospitable, but the gentleman who served us was rude! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! Like we did something wrong spending our money at this establishment.  We asked him if the toddler who was with us could get his water ASAP, as the long wait had been hard on him. He looked at us like we were from another planet. Not only did he not apologize for the wait he huffed and puffed and started stammering \"YOU HAVE TO BEAR WITH US\". 

WE HAVE BEEN BEARING WITH YOU FOR AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The rudeness continued throughout the entire meal. 

After all of this, the food was mediocre. Nothing special. Bland.  We were never apologized to from any of the staff nor were we even offered a fee appetizer or drink for the wait. 

If I ever return to this restaurant I can assure you it will be by force and not by choice. I can find good cheesecake at a lot of other restaurants that will be happy to take my money."}
{"text":"I really like coming to this place.  Food and service is always good.  I like the take home meal choices and order it every time. I also enjoy the tiramisu!!! My favorite!"}
{"text":"Mediocre...Had the chicken piccata meal combined with my husband's chicken parm meal. The chicken was rubbery and took on the color of the spinach in my meal on the bottom of the chicken. The lemon butter sauce was the only saving grace. I ate that with the free bread that is given. My husband had chicken parm and did not care for his meal either but he ate it. 
We got the 2 for $45 meals which included two free meals. I opted for the lasagne. Heated it up today per Maggiano's instructions. Totally gross! I truly don't get it. Thank Goodness I had a gift card. Definitely will NOT return. Sorry Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Best Stuffed Mushrooms and Rigatoni D! I come here every time I'm in town since the Edina, MN location closed. Nice ambiance and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo close to getting 5 stars. However, one thing changed my mind. 

I had a reservation in the lunch hours, and I was on time and on my reservation notes, I proposed a booth. It wasn't ready when I got there so we had to take a timer and stand around.

30 minutes later we got the booth, and it was facing outside which was a good view. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. The booth took way to long to get and even when I put it for in advance.

The server was nice and quick, and explained the menu just right. 
The food was amazing! I love italian food and decided to go with lasagna, and it was hot and fresh tasting. It wasn't a loud place and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chain restaurants usually but this is great. Beautifully decorated with lots of dark woods and smells like my friend's Italian Grandma's kitchen. I was in heaven the moment I stepped inside. Table wasn't ready as we were a little early so got a drink at the bar, the specialty cocktailes we're delicous. Went with a party of 13. They sat us in the \"wine\" room so we were all by ourselves, which was great as we didn't have to compete with the entire restaurant noise level, just ours. Since we had a large party we went with the \"Family style\" dining option. Went for the middle level (classic) choice of 3 appetizers/salad, 4 entrees and 2 desserts. Lots of choices so had to come up with an organized way to get 13 people to agree. Once we figure that out it was on. Chopped salad, fried mozerella and stuffed mushrooms to start. Brought three platters of each which was more than enough but, did I mentione, this is also all you can eat! So never a worry there wouldn't be enough to go around. On to the main course (and timing was perfect, staggered but not too slow). Breaded Tilapia, chicken marsala, Lasagna and linguine with white clam sauce. All were super flavorful and again we ahd more than enough on the first serving, no need for a second order. Dessert was delish as well, (profiteroles and an apple tart) although I could only fit a bite of each aftert all that good food.  Highly reccomend especialyl for a large party."}
{"text":"Maggiano's, though a chain restaurant is always consistent.  Whether dining here when at home or traveling to a location in another city, you know exactly what to expect.  The quality of the food and service I find to be very good.  I have to come know that it is best to make a reservation or you can expect a wait.  When in the mood for pasta, their have, one take one home is a great value.  The calamari, and stuffed mushrooms are favorite appetizers of mine.  The pasta del mare is well stocked with shell fish.  I also enjoy the occasional veal dishes."}
{"text":"Great spot for a taste of Italy. I had the gluten free carbonara- YES - they have gluten free pasta! Would definitely recommend this to others and return! 
Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After having a great dinner here with my boyfriend. He forgot his credit card, by the time we realized it we were all the way across the country where we live. We called the next day and asks to speak to the manager Derrick and after proper verification Derrick went out of his way to mail us the credit card. Not only did he cover the expense for shipping but over nighted it to make sure we got it the next business day. This type of customer service is what's missing now a days. We were very impressed with how well we were treated. It was definitely above and beyond and exceed are expectations. I never write reviews but this one couldn't go without. Expect great food and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"I honestly feel that this place was overrated. I always get people that tell me that this place was awesome which I don't agree. Its also overpriced for what they give you a dinner for two here is a hundred bucks. I feel like I can get more for my money somewhere else sorry to be blunt but I eat out alot so if Im going to spend that kind of money I should feel satisfied right?"}
{"text":"Pretty standard for a chain Italian restaurant. Would give it higher rating but the Host was not very nice."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Nathan went beyond to make our anniversary dinner very special.    We will be back and tell all our family and friends.  So happy you are in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"While I was walking over with a party of 5 I called in our reservation. The lady on the phone was so accommodating and accepted my fast reservation. When we arrived, we were promptly escorted to our table. Our server Noe greeted us and found out that we were on our lunch break and preceded to take our order. We needed to be in and out. Our food came out in 20 minutes hot and fresh! I had the lunch combination Meatball sub and a side spinach salad. The Meatballs were so good! Every time I come here we have fast friendly service and thoroughly enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Super classy restaurant! Food was great & the service was superb. We really enjoyed our food, the portions were pretty good. The location is on the strip so expect to pay!  This is definitely worth it, try them."}
{"text":"Sisi the server was so nice that is why I gave 1 star other than that the food did not taste very good but the salmon was very delicious. But overall we are very disappointed. Our order Took like 30 min to get Ceasar salad (it was to much sour) Alfredo Fettuccine pasta, 4 cheese ravioli all this gradian are ready and need just to combine"}
{"text":"Great place with fancy atmosphere and reasonable prices. The service was slow bit the server was friendly.

Parking is limited. 

Dining area was cold. 

The bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat on the strip.  We didn't have reservations, but we took seats in the bar area. Other reviews suggested reservations, so if you have a large group or need to make a show, make reservations.  I had the tomato basil soup and chopped salad. Both were wonderful.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. My children had the cheese ravioli's and the penne pasta. They also offer family style meals if you prefer that.  The waitress was very friendly and service was great.  I would recommend this to anyone going to Vegas. so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre. This was reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!!!
Service was fast and the server was very knowledgeable on the latest menu updates.  The \"Linguini Di Mare\" is quite possibly the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever eaten.  My wife \"Rigatoni Di\" was excellent as well.  Maggiano's always has some of the best wine sauces.   I'm speechless.  It takes a lot to impress me, and I can only think of the positive and wonderful experience that my wife and I experienced.f

One more thing,  I almost forgot about the desert.  The \"Desert Sampler\" pushed us over the edge as we drifted into a food coma.  Coffee is needed to make the drive home.  Sorry the picture isn't better, but we had a hard time waiting."}
{"text":"Great service but horrible food. I got linguine with white clam sauce. The dish was dry..... Not what it's used to be."}
{"text":"Would give 6 starts if I could.

First thing you notice is the hustle of the staff; everyone's zooming about and touching base with the diners and are SUPER accommodating. Johnny was lightning quick with our requests, more than happy to answer any questions, and all-around positive! Any assisting staff was also amicable.

This was our first visit, so the Assistant Chef (Chris?) Came out to greet us and welcomed us with some complimentary bruschetta (topped with the juiciest tomatoes I've ever had). 

We ordered the dinner for two deal that allows us 1 appetizer, 2 entrees for there, 2 entrees to take home, and 1 dessert. The mozzarella marinara was amazing (these are not mozzarella sticks, they are mozzarella bricks!) and our pastas were hot and delicious. Will definitely be going back. Oh, and the creme brulee with fresh strawberries? Mind-blowing. It wasn't a small ramekin, it was a PLATE. They are bountiful in their proportions and friendly with their service.

Extra bonus: The parmesan cheese is table-side so you can drown your meal in it without shame."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 615PM for my daughters 14th birthday - she wanted italian food with some close friends. We were 30 min early, but they waited until 615 to seat us - which would have been great, if the service times were fantastic.

For a party of 8 it took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered. Then close to 40 minutes to get our meals after being ordered. Our party was ready to leave after filling up on bread and drinks for 45 minutes! Once we were finishing up, it took another 20 minutes to bring out the cake that we brought in. Nothing was done in the dead time to fill the wait... having a similar wait time experience at another nearby restaurant, they brought out a couple courses of comped appetizers to sate people due to the extended wait time. 

The meals were great. All of the food was enjoyed once they replaced the kids macaroni and cheese plate. For some reason their kids dish is made with a bitter white cheese and my son didn't like it.

I would definitely return here, but they need to pay closer attention to the service times and fix whatever the issue is that is stretching out their table turns."}
{"text":"This resturant is like right down the street from fashion square sorta. A long ways down that one street but yeah. Its the big monsterous resturant on the corner near that Frank Lloyd Wright Tower deal-ie bug. Yeah so they are kinda expensive and while they offer portions that are overtly large, I found it bland and not so good overall. I wouldn't really recommend it at all... unless I don't like you then HAVE AT IT!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Maggiano's and after tonight it is my new favorite Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is divine and the service absolutely superb. We were warmly welcomed by our server who attended to us hand and foot and were given amazing bread and oil to begin with. Our server made sure our bread basket was full all night and refilled our drinks without any hesitation right before we took our last sip. We ordered the raviolis, zidi, chicken, and my little brother ordered from the kids menu. All of our food was prepared beautifully and including the kids plate. We all shared from each other and loved every dish. When we ordered dessert our server gave us all new silverware, napkins, and plates. We ate the dessert sampler and it was not only well priced but tasted amazing. We were given 5 samples of the different desserts offered and loved every single one. I am a very picky eater and surprisingly loved every sample given. The staff was especially curdious towards my little brother and even gave him a little personal bag of bread to take home. The service was better than expected and the food wonderful. Richard, our server, was the best and I hope to have him again when I return."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my husband's birthday and tried their family style menu. It's amazing, satisfying and worth it. We had so much fun. The way family style goes is you pick 2 choices of appetizer, salad, pasta, main entree, and dessert for the family. We thought its not enough but we're amaze on how the food being served seems it never ends. They will refill your food, so its constantly fresh plus you're able to take home your food. Price is worth it. We definitely recommend Maggiano's to family and friends."}
{"text":"Oh boy. This was probably my best meal during my stay in Vegas. The food here is breathtakingly good, particularly the appetizers. Get the stuffed mushrooms; you will thank me. The bruschetta is also worth mentioning; I guarantee you'll be asking for more bread to scoop up the abundance of tasty tomatoes. For dinner, I had the chicken marsala which was very good. My boyfriend got chicken franchise which (according to him) was decent. The potatoes and salad that his meal came with were excellent. Our waiter was very sweet. Everything, for me, was truly above average. I hope the Maggiano's in the tri-state are equally amazing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff are great. Price for the quality and quantity of food is good. We had a group of 18 and did the family dinner plan, a great deal especially if everyone is starving. The food and drinks keep coming without asking until you beg them to stop. Taking into account we were eating dinner at 10 pm and they were closing I will say that they did a great job and didnt rush us. We will return again at a regular dinner hour and see if the food is any better."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the shrimp scampi with added crushed red pepper. The scampi sauce was not too creamy it had just the right amount of garlic and wine. The salad with the Italian house dressing was very fresh, however, the dressing had a little too much of a vinegar taste. Overall, very satisfied and great ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that Maggiano's only had 3.5 stars. My family went there last night, and it was fantastic! 

Service: From the hostess to the manager that stopped by our table, everyone was great. Our waitress was quick, attentive, and had a very pleasant and energetic attitude. She spent time making recommendations (which were on point), and making sure we were taken care of. My step-father loved the wine glasses with the \"M\" etched into them (their last name is Miltz), and the manager stopped buy and set everything up for my step father to purchase a dozen. Also they sent out a complimentary appetizer of fried ravioli (which were HUGE and absolutely perfect) to our table just because we were new to the restaurant. 

Food: Great. I'm a huge Italian food lover, and a foodie in general. I'm not one that thinks Applebee's is class A dining, so I consider myself to have decent taste. We had the seasonal white wine sangria with cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries. So perfect and refreshing. The bread was incredibly soft and delicious. My boyfriend and mom both got the \"Lighter Take\" of chicken parm. I tried it, and it was excellent. It was a great portion, and you couldn't tell it was healthier at all. Also it's great they have several options for those watching their waistline. I had the chicken and spinach manicotti. The chicken was tender and well seasoned, the spinach was bright and obviously fresh, the cheese blend was perfect, and the Alfredo sauce was flavorful without being salty. It was comfort food to the max. My step dad had the seasonal crab and asparagus bruschetta. It was also delicious, however he was a little put off by the crab being creamed, since it didn't say so on the menu. We ended the dinner with a tiramisu- which was one of the best I've ever had (and tiramisu is my favorite dessert). It was so good that my boyfriend, who insisted he was too full for dessert, ended up devouring half of it because it was so great. If I had anything to complain about, I'd just say that the salads had too much dressing for my taste. But next time I'll just ask for it on the side. 

Seriously, this place is fantastic. We'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Our server, Keana was amazing; Everything we had was good, from the filet mignon to the linguine mare. The place was Packed for Mother's Day so we didn't get seated right away but they made sure to accommodate us sooner than the specified wait time. Servings were big as well so splurging didn't feel like a waste. I'd definitely comeback.

I didn't particularly like the hostesses in the front, they weren't very friendly and they were just gossiping in the front. Totally unprofessional but overall the service was great"}
{"text":"Great wedding venue, at first I thought it would be too casual but it was perfect for the couple getting married. The banquet rooms are secluded from the rest of the restaurant so it didn't feel like we were in a restaurant...unless you had to go to the bathroom, everyone had to walk through the main dining room. They set up a dance floor in the connecting room. The food was sized perfectly for sharing with a table of 8. My favorites were: eggplant parmesan, angel hair with sausage and chicken piccaca."}
{"text":"The noodles were saggy and broken. There was supposed to be mushrooms in the vegetarian pasta... none. The sauce was underwhelming. The noise level was intolerable. Our waitress, Kim was wonderful, even under the pressure of a full house. I wouldn't eat here during peak hours. Not worth the wait or your time. The prices were out of control, vegas style. Also, if you are going to be on the \"Strip\" you might just want to up your GAME as a player. Food is a big part of visiting Vegas and this was a sad state of affairs for a restaurant chain that  usually can be good in it's selection and options. I have to give KIM our waitress that night a two thumbs up. She went above and beyond and took my meal off my bill. Even though I didn't protest until we were done, nor did I ask her deduct the costs from my bill, she did it anyway. I returned the kind gesture by giving her the tip increase she deserved. Now, that's great service and she was considerate and understanding. I can't say the same for the Kitchen help that created such a mess of a dish. Time to replace them with a more competent team of cooks. 

Sorry Maggiano's you get an F for really fucking up a vegetable dish. Don't go here on peak hours or vacation times, you will regret it."}
{"text":"We went here for our first time ever last weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We had a great table next to the windows that overlooked the strip. The place was very busy with prom night so our server was a little busy but that's ok he was still very nice and it was great to see all the kids dressed up! The food was great and the price is amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was really bad. We waited 15 min before my mother went and said something to the hostess. After about 10 more min a waitress came by finally. She took our order and then we waited another 35 min before our food came out. She never came by once to check on us, or refill our waters. My mother's salad that she order didn't come out till our main course. The waitress was standing off to the side talking to for a while to a group of people. I can't stand bad service. It doesn't matter to me how good the food is. Be attentive. You work in customer service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, reasonable prices, great all around. Try the Nuzzo's Gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food, great service, it was truly an amazing night followed by Mystere which was an amazing show as well. 
Even had the 2 little old men come to the table to serenade us! lol"}
{"text":"Went to Maggiano's on Sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. We were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. We were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. We were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. I was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.

From dinner we ordered the Classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. The food doesn't stop. The only hard part was agreeing on what to order. 

Appetizers: Calamari Fritté and Bruschetta. 
Salads: Ceasar and Chopped.
Pastas: Mom's Lasagna and Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci 
Entrees: Chicken Saltimbocca and Eggplant Parmesan
Desserts: Creme Brulee and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake 

My favorites were the Chopped Salad, love blue cheese! Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the Eggplant Parmesan had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. Creme Brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. I would also recommend the Chianti Castello di Querceto. Went really well with the Mom's Lasagna.

Ryan was our server and he was fantastic. Very attentive and helpful. They even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. The night was great. Thank you Maggiano's and Ryan!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is always a stop for us when we are in Vegas.  Consistently great food and wine.  Stopped in yesterday to hang out and enjoy some vino while my better half shopped, and SURPRISE, did not realize they had a $5 pour happy hour.  Super place to eat, and now also to kill time if I need to."}
{"text":"This is another place that I've only experience for Happy Hour.  I would have given the place a 5 if they hadn't taken the pizzas off the HH menu.   They were so good, the other items like the crispy onions, the mozarella sticks, etc. were still fabulous.  They usually have drink specials as well, like deals on Pink Vodka martinis.  Depending on the day, there is also a piano player in the lounge/bar area."}
{"text":"Chicken marsala is terrific and very tasty.  Liked the option of a mini dessert, which is just the perfect size for a little taste rather than over-indulging . Wonderful service and fabulous staff in the bar area; where I dined and watched the football game without sound, so I could hear the nice music.  My server/ waitress, Dani, rocked. Will definitely add this to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"We went here for a business lunch. The atmosphere was really nice and bright and felt very appropriate for a power lunch. Prices were pretty reasonable. 

*Hot bread - highlight of the meal! 
*Chopped salad - the \"crispy pancetta\" was bacon bits, ick, otherwise not a bad salad
*For my entree I got the roasted chicken with \"crispy potatoes and green beans\". Everything on the plate was soggy, tasteless and gross. I realize one shouldn't order roasted chicken at an Italian place, hence why this place gets 3 stars instead of 2!!

Overall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in Vegas it's hard for me to endorse this place. Boring and corporate come to mind. For Italian I prefer Nora's."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Maggiano's, but this location is my favorite so far. We had a very nice strip view, the service was great and the food was delicious as always. The fried zucchini appetizer is a must try."}
{"text":"Good food!! best service! It's sucks that the sewers stink like poop! I would seal them up myself if I was the owner. Buy some foam spray. Spray where the tiny hole is used to pull up the lid"}
{"text":"Came here for my moms birthday but for some reason they were not accepting \"walk-ins\" 2 hour+ wait for anyone without a reservation. Place was nowhere near busy plenty of tables open made no sense. Thanks for ruining our plans will not be back!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great!!! Bri was our server and she was amazing. She helped give us suggestions and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars but our first server was HORRIBLE!! I wish I could remember his name. Thankfully he ended up going home after our appetizers, and we got a new server! The food was delicious and very filling! We ordered the family style option, and it was way too much food for 4 people! We had yummy leftovers though!"}
{"text":"Came here two nights ago to celebrate my besties birthday. I love that you can take an elevator from the parking lot directly to the restaurant, so gangster. The restaurant's view is gorgeous and the ambiance has a sexy feel to it. The only thing I was not a fan of was the red and white checkered table cloths. Such a beautiful dining room overlooking the strip, soothing jazz music playing in the background with those table cloths...


Our server was very friendly, down to earth and attentive. Our orders came out surprisingly fast, as an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms, we loved it. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan which was very tasty as well, Italian food when cooked properly is very comforting. Also another thing that I really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run, was that the bread for the table came out very warm . I hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread. 

Overall it was a great experience! Lovely restaurant, nice atmosphere, genuine service, good Italian food and convenient parking."}
{"text":"Iliana was our lovely server for a party of 13, and she was fantastic!  Food was great, drinks were perfect, overall great night!"}
{"text":"Really nice Italian restaurant.  Good for big families and brunches. The buy 1 get a take home menu pastas are an amazing deal and all heat up really good.  The lasagna is so good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times over the years but was just back recently for a company Christmas party or \"holiday\" party for the PC'ers out there. We were able to try a variety of dishes including the calamari, salad, chicken parm, lasagna, and some desserts too. The calamari was good but the chicken parm was a little dry. The meat lasagna was by far the best dish we had. I really enjoyed the flavors and could have eaten more but everyone at my table felt the same way and polished off that dish quickly. We tried two desserts, a seven layer chocolate and mint cake (tasted like Thin Mint cookies) and their tiramisu. Both fantastic. If it wasn't for the company picking up the tab though, I probably would not make this my first choice when it comes to Italian places."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Long wait but that's expected from a great restaurant. The spinach salad was delicious and the shrimp and crab cannelloni was so rich and creamy!!!!

The sangria was yummy as well!!

Overall the salad was so good we almost forgot about our main course!! 

Great place will come back!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch today and everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!!!! Our server Danny was amazing because he always made sure our drinks were filled without asking and also checked on us if we needed anything for our meals.  We had the Limoncello Tiramisu and it was so GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Good food to share family style.  Nice private room for 14 people with a nice view.  Better than your normal Italy style chain restaurant, but would've have given a better rating if the courses came quicker between the apps and the main course.  Overall, really good dining experience."}
{"text":"I was craving for some carbonara last Tuesday and my husband found this on yelp. So we drove to downtown summerlin to try their pasta. We chose Marco's Meal for two (It has a starter, two pasta and a dessert plus two classic pasta for take home). We had sausage and peppers for starter, I've got Lighter take Fettucinne Alfredo and my husband tried Rigatoni \"D\" and a newyork cheesecake for dessert which we took home also since we were so full. Our server (forgot her name) was so attentive and she always makes sure that everything is good. Overall, I enjoyed my every bite here. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Maggianos is some of the best italian food in Scottsdale! I have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing along with the staff. Everybody is very welcoming and relaxed. My last visit was the best yet. Our waitress was a delight. Her name was Taylor and she was extremely friendly and helpful! She made great conversation and made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal! She should honestly be promoted to management. We saw her at her other tables as well and she was so friendly and nice to everybody she encountered (even a group of rude old men)! I promise you will not be disappointed going to maggianos!"}
{"text":"I don't often give five star reviews but Maggianos deserves all five and then some. This was my very first time here. My friends and I came for happy hour.  The menu is small but sometimes that's better when you only have a limited amount of time and lets be real, its happy hour. We ordered several of the flatbread pizzas and cocktails. All of them were excellent. Not only did we get superior service from our waitress but we were also greeted by the maitre de. He is a wonderful man who was so engaging and just a sweet man. Oh and I should also mention we had dessert which was awesome as well. I've found a new happy hour spot. Thanks Maggianos for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Service was great, Penelope was such an amazing server and could answer all of our questions. She also gave great recommendations and our food was amazing from started to dessert! We will definitely be back once we get through all of our leftovers"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was impeccable. Our waiter, William, did a wonderful job. Since this was my first time visiting, it took me a while to decide what i wanted. He informed me that if i get something i don't like, i can return it and get something else. So we ordered the zucchini fritte as an appetizer, the rigatoni D for me, and the wife ordered the chicken and spinach manicotti. The zucchini tasted wonderful. Almost immediately after finishing the appetizer, the entrees arrived. My wife's food looked great, mine.... not so much. Not wanting to cause a seen, i attempted to eat it. Well, to me it tasted how it looked lol. It was very bland, the noodles were hard, and all the sauce was at the bottom. Needless to say, i did not enjoy this. After talking with our waiter, he got me another dish to replace my first choice. All in all, i enjoyed my visit here and hope to make my way back sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a very intimate upscale Italian restaurant. Even though it is a chain of restaurants it is still very intimate and exclusively ran. The downtown Summerlin location , is located near crave and cream ice cream shop. The best place to find parking for this location would be on the east side of the building. I have to ask him at that I really like this location to Maggiano's better than others. The service is truly fast and friendly, you're immediately greeted as soon as you're seated and your food is brought out while still steaming hot. During our visit we had the buy one take one home special and so I ordered the lasagna for the restaurant and the Baked Ziti to take home. The lasagna comes in such a large portion that I ended up with a large portion of leftover which,  I ended up eating on it for 3 days. I mistakenly decided to order a side Caesar salad with my meal which was delicious but not necessary. I also normally order extra cheese or have extra cheese placed on top of my lasagna or my Ziti because it's not cheesy enough but that was not a requirement nor necessary during this visit. Last bit of fun if it's your birthday let your server know because they will bring you out a plate of lemon cookies with candles on them and they will sing your guests happy birthday. Over on my experience at this restaurant was great and I would highly recommend anyone enjoying this restaurant while walking around downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I would assume that since this is an Italian Restaurant, their pasta should be on point. I ordered the Pesto Perlini Mozzarella and the pasta was way to soggy for my liking. I'm guessing they were trying to have the same gooey consistency of the melted mozzarella, but I didn't like it. I think it was overcooked. The mushroom appetizer was yummy! and my husband got the chicken piccata which was ok. nothing stood out. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Went in last night after some friends getting married.  I am giving it 3 stars because the atmosphere is great and our server was wonderful. I have been here a few times and the food was always good. Last night it was lacking something. The presentation was boring it was as if it was just thrown on the plate little messy. Apps were good chopped salad was Delish.  I would say that was my fav of all the dishes we had.  Seems as if quality has gone downhill :("}
{"text":"Chain Restaurant. Cannot go wrong but is also not at all overwhelming. When you are hungry and look for something not too expensive, this is a nice choice on the strip"}
{"text":"7 of my girls and I went to Vegas to celebrate 2 of their birthdays. We didn't have the coupon for BOGO but he still let us take home 7 classic pastas home for free with the order of 7 classic pastas at the mention of the coupon. Service was great and I can't get enough of the balsamic vinegar nd oil and bread. Although he did forget about the birthdays and i had to remind him again to bring out the cookies in the end. Since it WAS a classic pasta, the lasagna was a little dry, fettucini was extremely bland, but the spaghetti was really goodand came with a good portion.This was my 2nd time here And the first time was in San Jose. My first experience was better because we didnt do the BOGO and ordered specialty pastas and seafood. But I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and excellent service! I came here with my brother and his family to celebrate his birthday on Friday and we had Nick as our server. He suggested a great red wine that we all enjoyed, refilled our drinks without us ever having to ask, and he was very friendly and polite the entire meal. When it was time for dessert he suggested the Nutella Cheesecake which was to die for! 100 out of 10 I would come back here"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food and service is off the chain. Personal recommendation are the tenderloin medallions and the old fashioned shows off the skills of the bar."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here on August 3rd...IT WAS PERFECT!! The food was amazing, and there was LOTS of it! Our guests were thrilled. We had 120 guests, so we took up all of the banquet space. The dance floor was packed the entire time thanks to the DJ they recommended to us. We also used their vendors for cake and photo booth. 

Sabrina was very accommodating, and quick to respond to my questions via email or phone. 

I cannot recommend this place enough as a wedding reception venue. It looks good without any decor, even! Especially for Wynn brides - it is very convenient."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my experience.  For the price, this is not fine dining.  There was water all under our table that the host staff was going to sit us at. Place settings and china was dirty.   The food was bland but ok.  Our server was nice and very responsive."}
{"text":"My friends and I were tired and hungry from walking and just decided to go in here and I'm pretty glad we did. We got seated by the window so we had a  pretty nice view of the strip. The food was good, I ordered the  steak and it was really tender and well flavored. What I didnt like was that our waitress disappeared most of the time and was no where to be seen and also my drink Manhattan, it was a little too strong for me and not like what the waitress described it to be refreshing and sweet."}

{"text":"I've always been a huge Maggiano's fan. Yes, it's a chain but the quality of food is that of an Italian, family owned restaurant. The service is always just as impeccable and I'm glad to report that the same experience that I've always had at Maggianos carries over to Vegas as well.

We happened to make it during Happy Hour although it was a sheer coincidence. We started off with the chicken balsamic flatbread for $4 and a couple glasses of wine for $5. Woohoo! The chicken balsamic was divine. All of the flavors and the light and airy flatbread really helped make this a light but delicious appetizer. On to the entrees. I had the mushroom ravioli with braised veal. The sauce was lick-the-plate good and I found myself scooping up as much as I could with my fork. I don't feel that the veal added much when eating it in the same bite as the ravioli, but I ate it separate drenched in the sauce and I preferred it that way. My husband had the chicken and shrimp ziti and while it was good, it wasn't anywhere near as good as mine. I like my ziti spicy and this was pretty mild in comparison to my personal preference. We also had the creme brulee which had a little bit of orange liqueur in it, as well as a strawberry on top. YUM! Best part of the meal, of course. I'm a sucker for burnt sugar and custard, what can I say, but I thought that the orange really added something different to the dish. 

Our waiter gave us amazing service (very attentive) and he was also very attractive--two unrelated things, but hey -- I have to appreciate a fine looking person when I see one.

My only complaint was these jerks next to us allowed their three children to run across our half of the restaurant. It was all I could do to not get up and ask the mother to control them. One of the other waiters asked her politely twice to please take stop allowing her children to run around like it was Chuckie Cheese, but she continued to allow them to knock things off neighboring tables and climb all over booths. It reminds me of a Yelp Talk discussion a few weeks back about why children shouldn't be allowed in fancy restaurants. I never had much of an opinion on the issue until this experience, although I can't knock Maggianos a star on it, as they did try respectfully to take care of the situation."}
{"text":"Great lunch for a reasonable price - somewhat rare anywhere on the strip. I had the lunch combination with Tuscan Chicken Sausage soup and Spinach salad. The spinach salad was fresh and it was all very tasty. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"The great sirloin steak I had last time is no longer on the menu. It is hard to find a steak made just right- often it comes charred on the outside, this didn't. It was also only about $20, while their other steaks are too pricey."}
{"text":"This Maggiano's, like all the others, is what it is....but a little bit better given the excellent viewpoint from the fashion show mall out onto the strip.  Went here with 12 people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food.  Like all chains, the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses.  

Hits include the super garlicy Shrimp Oreganata, Garlic Shrimp Linguine, and Lobster Ravioli.  Needless to say, they do garlic right.  The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)

Misses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.

I last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.

2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.  Its closer to a 2.5 than a 3, but I'll round up for good memories."}
{"text":"The seasonal menu was amazing tonight.  Butternut Squash Ravioli and Pumpkin Cheesecake for dessert.  Wonderful service, clean, kid friendly, and the food was fantastic.  Not usually into chain restaurants while in Vegas but got hungry while shopping and was pleasantly surprised-  seems a step up from other locations I've visited!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I work right next to this establishment 
Decided to try some since I haven't been here before. 
I ordered the spaghetti & meatsauce, it was good. 
Service was quick and on point, Pricing wasn't bad as well. 

5+ will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant and our server Eli was THE BEST. He had wonderful customer service and amazing recommendations. We got here a little before 6pm and Eli immediately recommended drinks and appetizers off the happy hour menu so we could take advantage of the happy hour specials. The food was great we had the Jonny's carbonara which was rich and creamy (delicious) and a New York steak medium rare (cooked to perfection) with garlic mashed potatoes...I would order everything again and try new things on the menu."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant it's actually pretty good. I loved how they had an outside patio. The bread was not so good but our server was really nice and what he recommended was really yummy. Their Rigatoni D was good and their chicken santi something. My bf enjoyed the calamari and it said it was crunchy and not fishy. My favorite of the whole meal was the cheesecake and vera's lemon cookies. You have got to try these lemon cookies they are sooooo good!!! Prices were $11-$18 for entrees. Only thing I didn't like was the glass of wine I had. I think they didn't put the cork in enough in the bottle so it had a bland taste or they left it too long to open up.

PROS: Food, outside patio, service, lemon cookies
CONS: WIne been opened for too long"}
{"text":"Upretensiøst spisested, med store porsjoner og god vin. Er spesielt glad i Coppola Diamond collection !"}
{"text":"Went on a dinner date with my girlfriend. Food was excellent, very large portions, neither of us finished our meals, but did have dessert... Pastas were delicious.. will return soon..."}
{"text":"Aw, man! We had such high hopes for this place. Came in to celebrate a special night- seated promptly, received menus and water... and then it was all DOWNHILL from there. The food was decent, but the service was basically non-existent. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter placed it on the table (no bucket, no ice)- 20 minutes went by and he finally brought bread (oh, and ice- too late for our room temperature Riesling!) Food came out \"warm\", not hot. And then we waited another 20 minutes after we finished for boxes and our bill. We won't be back because of the service- or lack thereof."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and amazing food!  Anyone would be comfortable in shorts or a suit."}
{"text":"So i pass by maggianos every time I visit southcoast in CALI which is almost weekly but I had never tried their food.  So when we were in vegas for my birthday we decided to head their for our lunch before we headed back to Cali.   We ordered our meal after awhile because the server was being erratic and then after twenty minutes or so we got our appetizer.  After we recieved it they asked us to move to another table towards the middle and we had to carry our own food and dishes over.  Then after another twenty minutes or so we received our food.  Too bad when we said \"no marinera' on my besties pasta and confirmed that we are sorry but to please substitute and she glady said it was no problem it of course came out with marinera.  However it took so long in the first place for our food to arrive so my bestie stuck to it.  THEN what happened is unbelievable..they actually started VACUUMING right behind us.  Back and Forth Back and Forth with NO warning what-so-ever which I don't even know if it would have made it any better.  After 5-10 minutes...YES SERIOUSLY the couple behind us asked to get the check because they couldn't stand it.  After the whole ordeal our server comes out as if she just realized the vacuum had been on and asks if we want to move.... NO IDIOT THE DUST ALREADY FLEW UP AND LANDED SAFELY ON MY FOOD. I DONT WANT TO EAT NOW I WANT TO GET OUT... 

apparently they had their carpet cleaned and they needed to vacuum the moisture out....As if that could not wait until another time????

what a dissappointment.  So I asked her for their card so I could leave corporate a comment.  I didn't get to it until a month or so later and they said it was too late to leave a comment but too bad I still did.  After my comment I didn't receive any notice that they received my comment.  I am NOT looking for free comps or anything of that nature I just want them to understand that is NOT what I expected in a restuarant...it reminded me of those annoying sweepers in cafeterias/fastfood joints.  

This location needs HELP"}
{"text":"Great spaghetti w/ meatball. Pasta had great tooth, the sauce was very good smooth and low acidic."}
{"text":"Two words; Family Style. Forget about Bucca di Beppo, they dont even compare. This place isnt cheap. Take my advice get 3 friends and order the family style, and dont forget to order seconds...on everything, you know to take home, for later."}
{"text":"Make a reservation if you are eating here before attending a show on a Friday night. Waiting time can be anywhere from 30 to 90 mins."}
{"text":"I was with a group of ten and after finally deciding on Italian food for dinner, we headed to Maggiano's.  It was a Monday night at 8pm and it was pretty crowded.  We were told that we HAD to order off the family style menu even though the menu clearly states that they \"ASK parties of 10 or more to order Family Style.\" There was no mention anywhere that this was required.  After asking if it was possible to order individual entrées, the hostess looked at us like we were stupid and asked \"why?\"  I simply stated we all have different tastes and one person in our party had food allergies.  Then what looked like the manager came over and told us that the kitchen could not accommodate a group of ten individual entrées and that the only way we could do that is if we split into two groups of five HOWEVER this would make the wait even LONGER.  We were confused because the kitchen would still be making ten orders but whatever.  We were annoyed with them already and decided to leave and check out El Segundo Sol, the Mexican restaurant right below Maggiano's.  Read my review of El Segundo Sol, they definitely took care of us!"}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour for lackluster food that barely rivaled Chef Boy Ardee. This place is a shadow of its former self and its origins from Chicago. They've managed to accomplish what other big chains avoided - mediocrity. Skip the drama and head to places like The Cheesecake Factory which, while not enlightened, delivers quality food with quality service at reasonable prices. Maggianos Las Vegas just doesn't make the cut. Skip it."}
{"text":"We avoid the strip area if possible, it's usually crowded and lots of traffic, but when we do make a trip this way, our dinner spot is Maggiano's!

Each time we are here, the service is always great, no matter who it is. Managers are looking around, making sure things are in order. Someone is alway coming around to refill drinks, clear empty dishes and our server tonight, Val, is great. She made sure everything went smoothly, kids ordera were put in so they don't have to wait so long and brought out their desserts just at the right time.

Their portions are BIG, I always leave with half my dish to go and when I reheat it the next day, it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant every time I'm in Las Vegas. The evening I went it was crowded and the waiter seemed stressed. Even though we had reservations they still made us wait 15 min. They seem to do this every time I come here. The view is fabulous! The food was perfect. It was my birthday so they brought me cookies. The only complaint I have is the restrooms were filthy. Both men and women's."}
{"text":"found them on yelp and they were great! casual or fine dining this is the place! you will spend at least $15 per meal. so worth it. glad I came :) our server was amazing. they wee packed and we still got our food fast!"}
{"text":"Get that side dish that lets you try all the bruschettas. Each one tastes amazing.
I tried both the Shrimp Diavolo and the cheesy pasta with lobster dish, I forget the name.
Both were PACKED with seafood, I wasn't expecting that in such a fancy place.
The quality of the seafood was great, they were definitely never frozen.
I rarely eat at these kinds of restaurants, but pricing here is fair. I'd definitely come back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Can't give a review for food,we sat at the bar and 3 bartenders never took our food order. We paid for drinks and went to another place."}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy, but the Crispy Zucchini app was stellar and worth the wait. Our entree was just ok, the linguine di mare, probably wouldn't order it again. Our server really was phenomenal, and took great care of us."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time Sept 2011 with a group of 5. Like everyone says, its romantic, has great views of the strip, great service and the food is FANTASTIC. 

I had the fried calamari and eggplant parmesean and it was the best eggplant parmesean I've had so far. Everybody else really liked their food too, although I didn't get to try it. However I will be going back. Not to repeat what loads of others have said, so here's my recap:

Pros:
-Really good food
-Nice ambiance and views
-Easy to get to (Fashion Show Mall), cabs can just drop you off curbside in front of the restaurant.
-Surprisingly affordable! For the same cost as going to Bucca or Il Fornaio, this food kicks those places butts! (In my opinion =)
-The service was great. Super friendly wait staff and very helpful with the menu.

Cons:
-Not really a place to bring little ones as its kind of a \"romantic\" and quiet atmosphere, but I'm sure you could have them here."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!! Brought staff for dinner while at conference. From beginning to end, we were extremely happy with our service, ambiance, and food!! Our server, Paulo, was fantastic!! He was attentive, personal, professional, and thorough while fun!! 
We went family style and everything was delicious! Antipasti, stuffed mushrooms, and calamari fritte were all delicious! Large mushrooms with great filling, perfectly fried calamari with delicious marinara sauce - so good! Caesar salad was excellent. Our entrees, fettuccini Alfredo and shrimp scampi, were delicious!! Nice cream sauce on fettuccini and plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp with lemon and garlic. 
For dessert, the crème brûlée was creamy, smooth, and full of flavor under the crackly sugar top!! We also had the cheesecake which was very good with strawberries. 
Check it out when you're in Las Vegas - you'll be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Saturday unfortunately they only do brunch now.  Sadness.   We decided to stay and see what they had to offer.  Service was on point as usual and the ambience beautiful by the windows.  Started us off with an amuse Bouche, if you will,from the chef of a little lemon tartlet.  Very lemony and tart with some sweetness.  Great little starter.  Then We had the Eggs Benedict, crab cake style and meatball style.  Both were delicious.  Eggs were poached perfectly.  Warm and runny with the whites perfectly cooked.  And not soggy at all.  Potatoes were crisp and delicious.  Overall another delicious meal.  But really wish they still offered lunch.  Definitely in the mood for their chopped salad and meatballs."}
{"text":"I have been to Maggiano's several times, in several cities, but my visit on Sept. 10 is worth noting. By far, one of the best experiences I've had there.

Right off the bat, our waitress was excellent. I was there with my husband and parents. My dad generally likes to joke around and have a good time with our server. Our waitress, Carol, went right along with it. She was funny, personable and had great recommendations - on dinner, wine and dessert. We also got a great table - a round booth, against a wall. The restaurant can sometimes get very noisy, especially on a packed Saturday night. The seat helped to block some of that noise. 

The food at Maggiano's is very good. Typical Italian - salads, pastas, meat dishes. And you get A LOT of it. I have to say though, their classic pastas are one of the best deals I have ever seen. You order one of them at $12.95, and you get a second classic pasta, free, to-go. Great deal, great food. My baked rigatoni was delicious. Cheesy, with rich flavors, large chunks of tomato and spicy chicken. I took home the baked ziti, and it heated very well - almost as good as eating in the restaurant.

The table split a Chocolate Zuccotto cake and the special dessert - a peanut butter bar cake. That I wanted to like a lot, but was a little underwhelmed. The flavor was slightly bland - not as rich a peanut butter as I would have liked. The chocolate cake however... YUM-MY!! I am an admitted chocoholic. This was perfect. Moist cake with fluffy mousse and a thick chocolate frosting. I have to say though, if you're going to get it, it's wise to split!

On a side note, this is a great place for large groups. I have been for a few parties, and a few wedding rehearsal dinners as well. Maggiano's absolutely takes care of groups and treats them very well."}
{"text":"Another affordable dining spot on the Strip for those times when you've just bet everything on red and it's 27 black.

Fare is solid American-Italian in a spacious dining room on the second floor of Fashion Show mall. The Linguine di Mare is the stuff of my foodie dreams: linguine noodles (the best kind) in a spicy tomato sauce (not spicy enough for me) smothered in seafood goodness like plump, juicy shrimp, mussels, clams and lobster. My only regret was I had to leave some of the pasta behind or risk blowing chunks atop the Stratosphere after (stupid stomach that's sensitive to stupid spinning)!

My boyfriend's Lobster Carbonara could solve world hunger. There was so much of it! It was creamy deliciousness bathed in lobster groupies. Yuuuum!

Service was pretty slow, though, so try not to come during peak lunch hour on Saturday."}
{"text":"Maggiano's was outstanding went there to celebrate my wife's Birthday dinner and the staff did a great job. The food was Fantastic definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients = good food. Chicken Francese is the bomb! ...Also sausage & peppers appetizer was really good. ...Cool location is directly across from Wynn."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance here, and sometimes if you want the Vegas Strip, but not the feeling of chaos, this is the place to be. Lunch on the patio is fantastic, and is quite a unique people watching scene. I love their salads, wine menu and chicken marsala.  Usually, the service is great and the kitchen is consistent.

Be careful of the following:Their salads are spot on, but their house dressing  is on the sweeter side.  I personally prefer the italian which is homemade but not nearly as sweet.  Also, if you are not a fan of shaved chicken breast, then you should avoid adding chicken to your salads. It is not your usual chunky  breast. 

This establishment is way better than your typical Italian chain, and has incredible  family portions. Salute' to Maggiano's-you keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our early Valentine's dinner here (this is also where we had our first date!). I love the atmosphere here as well as the service. Our waiter Nick was amazing. He knew the menu like the back of his hand and had great recommendations. He constantly checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay. Food is always on point and I love their drink selection."}
{"text":"Watch out for this restaurant.  Can't speak for all Maggiano's, but if you come for lunch on Saturday, they quietly slip in front of you (at 1:30 p.m.) their most expensive menu, the dinner menu.  If you call them on it, they say gosh, we can give you our brunch menu or our lunch menu -- but too late.  Deceptive business practice is a sign of what the restaurant thinks of its customers."}
{"text":"Honestly, why have I not found this chain sooner!?

Maggiano's was my favorite place of my Vegas trip. I must admit, it was slightly biased- I was part of an organization, and the organization catered the food.. so I had, literally, had a TON of food. Nonetheless, it was the best way to try the food!

First, the appetizers came out. After having the appetizers, I was pretty set on making that my lunch! There was bruschetta, tomato caprese, two types of salad, but my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms. OH MAN, SO GOOD. I was trying to be all professional at this lunch, but all I really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate. It was so juicy and flavorful! 

Next, came the actual entrees. After filling up on the mushrooms and good salads, I was about stuffed already. The entrees were all really good as well! There was the Four Cheese ravioli (mmm, def was one of my faves!), herb chicken, pork medallions (also, one of my faves!), some pasta + vodka dish, and some great tasting beef. It was all really really good.

What really topped the meal off (well, any meal for all I'm concerned about) was the DESSERTS. First, these gigantic profiteroles came out, made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream. But, my favorite of all time came out.. the tiramisu!! As tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert, I had high expectations of this dessert.. and it was met. It was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right.. I was in heaven. 

Our waiter was great as well, explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks. He even answered nicely to all my curious questions of, \"so... what exactly is that? What is it cooked in?\" etc. 

Perhaps my view was slightly biased as I did not even have to pay for this lunch, but all I know, is the food was GREAT, and I would love to find a Maggiano's close to me! Mmm. :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant is pretty good, but service was poor.  After taking our initial orders, our server was hard to find."}
{"text":"I must say, I was quite impressed!  The food here was awesome!

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the beginning of the meal.  There were 2 hostesses, one who was very accommodating and the other who was, well...not.  She spoke to us quite rudely, as if we were a burden rather than a guest.  Maybe she was just having a bad day.  No harm, no foul.

We began with the calamari.  It was good, slightly undercooked.  I've had better before.  Our waiter was fantastic and took care of our every need.  I had shrimp fettuccine Alfredo  as my entree.  To my surprise, I was asked which pasta dish I would like to take home in addition to my main course!  Shrimp was cooked beautifley.  The Alfredo was to die for.

We followed up with some dessert, something we normally do not make it to, but I sure am glad we did.  We shared a monsterous creme brûlée (no need to order two) and it was I little piece of heaven, at the bottom of a ramikan.  The fresh strawberries on top brought it to the next level.overall, great food, great service, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would give the food a four star. We had the rigatoni with meat sauce. Would order again.
One complaint though. When we are sitting having a conversation. I hate when the waiter just includes the himself in the conversation and starts to offer his advice and input about what we are discussing. We are always courteous and thankful to the wait staff but if the customer wants to talk to you that is one thing but to just join in like you are having dinner with us. Really???"}
{"text":"We have frequented Maggiano's for ten years in Las Vegas and have had our disappointments in the last two years, especially that live music is at a minimum these days (& they have the space for a threesome!).  We dined there on 2/13 and found the prices had jumped considerably, including on happy hour.  The same old Sinatra & Tony Bennett played on and not even for a holiday weekend did they bring in a musician.  My salmon salad was delivered in a small bowl, making it look boring & unappetizing (why not spread out on a plate?)  My partner's country pasta dish of ricotta chicken meatballs & sundried tomatoes was not very Italian at all & he said he wouldn't order it again.  The service was terrific, however.   

So, here it is... capitalizing on their location & adhering to the bottom line called MONEY."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!!!!  The food was excellent and the service was amazing!  I had the chicken marsala and it was the best!  My daughter had the cheese ravioli and it was outstanding.  We also had a very nice view of the strip.  You can't beat this location inside of Fashion Show Mall.  I have dined at many many places in Vegas and I highly recommend this place!  Thank you for such a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This Chicago based Italian eatery is upscale enough to impress and homey enough to be believable when the server say, \"manga.\" The salads are large and the veggies are nice and garlicky. Nothing so outstanding as to wow, but a solid meal for anyone. One particular favorite for us the chocolate mousse cake. A bit on the pricey side and the ambiance is a bit corporate, but a great place for a celebratory meal that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4 star dinner..  unless you are one of those experienced in Italian cuisine then you may have a more advanced opinion on the taste of the food.  To me, the food was good.   Not great and doesn't make me rushing to come back for more, but good to the point that I had a lovely dinner with my family.
Stuffed mushrooms for appetizer were good.  Fresh and evenly flavored but nothing I can't easily make at home. (first plate came out and my husband took a bite only to get a long blonde hair in his mouth.. we notified our waitress who immediately apologized and took the plate to the manager, which came over to apologize and offer a new appetizer whether the same or a different one, and comped the appetizer for the troubles.)
My son had the kids Mac n cheese, one of the best Mac n cheeses we have tasted off of a kids menu.
My daughter had a Caesar salad add shrimp:  fresh and like a Caesar should taste.. I did not try her shrimp because she ate them so fast so they must've been good.
I ordered the lobster carbonara add Oscar style (crab meat and asparagus).  (((Next day update:: I just finished my leftovers and I can actually judge this dish.  I think it was good, but could've been better based on the ingredients alone.   The sun dried tomatoes would've been better in smaller pieces, and there weren't enough snap peas.. a few more would've given it that different texture that this dish lacks.  Maybe add a slice of or recommend garlic bread to soak up some of that cheesy sauce.))) 
My husband ordered the rigatoni d, that was quite delicious!
We also had the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert.  I should've taken our waitress suggestion and tried the Italian cream cake.. the chocolate one was good but it was just that, a good slice of chocolate overload cake (and this is coming from a chocolate lover.). 

Why we will go back:  ambience/atmosphere, good service, big selection."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain Italian food.  

The food is fair to above average for an Italian restaurant.  

I had the Rigatoni D and asked for modifications due to food allergies.  The chef came out and not only modified the dish, but came out with it to see how I liked it.  His name was Michael and it was terrific.

Also, they have mini desserts, which is a great idea.  You can order one individually or five different ones at a time (which we did).  The teramisu is really good.

In addition on that day they had a buy one get one free, so we walked out with an extra meal to go home.

Overall, I was impressed.  You wouldn't expect that type of individual service from an Italian chain."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 for dinner. Food was very good and the server was very friendly. One individual in party has a gluten allergy. The manager realized the pasta served was not gluten free as ordered and quickly came by to right the wrong. He not only comped the meal and brought the correct pasta but also  provided gift cards that we could use for the bill or a future visit!  That was above and beyond expectations and guarantees our future business."}
{"text":"I will only speak for catering/delivery experience.

In general, the delivery department was very friendly and helpful. Sarah was very patient with me when I was trying to work out an order under my budget.  If you are interested in their delivery/catering service, you should definitely check out their delivery menu. Delivery fee is another additional 15%, not including tips. Delivery was on time and the set up was very professional - they provided tableclothes, bread, butter, sauces, dressings, extra cheese, and utensils, just everything you can imagine that you need.

The food was ok, not the best I've had but definitely not bad at all. It is definitely an affordable option for corporate events. They look nicer than pizzas, right?"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. Went to have lunch today (Sunday) and wanted to sit on the patio because it was so nice outside. 

The hostess was rude and told us they could not seat us outside because they had to clean it. 

Really? It's that dirty-- you are not seating people on a weekend when the weather is nice. If you let the patio get that dirty I can only imagine what the inside is like. 

Will not be returning to this location. Good luck keeping customers."}
{"text":"I setup a Christmas party for my office employees. Because of the mix up and it being cold, they gave us a private banquet room without any charge which I thought was amazing. Had the family style menu and due to certain allergies they had no problem putting certain things like mushrooms on the side. They suggested delicious drinks and the servers we had were very attentive and friendly. So much food they bagged it to go for us to take with us. Had a balcony which we were allowed to go outside and smoke so that was another plus. We even had speakers and a radio at our disposal. Everything was delicious and setup exceptionally. Very happy with the experience. The tiramusu and their chocolate specialty cake are to die for lol their pasta and meat dishes were on point. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Ok, so they have a special going on. Until 11/19/17, you can order carry out for just $35! Look at all you get: 1 appetizer for 2 people, 2 salads,  2 entrees and 1 dessert! Do much yo choose from! I had the mussels Fra Diavlo, 1 Caesar salad, 1 spinach salad, mushroom ravioli, eggplant parmesan, and a dozen lemon cookies (since it is carry out, ice cream wouldn't work out so well)! By the time I got it home, it was still hot, even the bread!   The mussels were very well flavored, with the Fra Diavlo sauce having just the right amount t of spice. I cannot get over how smooth and cheesy the mushroom ravioli was! Didn't eat the eggplant parm yet, gonna dive into that tomorrow! The lemon cookies were amazing! Very light and lemony! I had placed my order just before 8:00pm and scheduled it out for pickup by 8:15pm (the first time slot available), by 8:20pm the hostess had arrived with my order. I know I put pressure on the cooks with such a short wait time, but they made it work! Will definitely be going back there for a sit down meal, as it was so enjoyable from my own home!"}
{"text":"Had such a great first experience at Maggiano's!! Our server Nicole was amazing. We wanted to eat somewhere before our show at the Wynn. We knew that it was our own fault for running a little behind, but when Nicole found out that we were on a time limit, she made sure that they had everything out for us in a timely manner without us having to ask her. We were not expecting that at all. She gave us suggestions on what to order and what not to order since certain items take longer to make. She kept checking up on us and our waters were always filled. Portions are big (family style is an option as well) so we ended up ordering an appetizer, one pasta dish, and then dessert. Soooo good! We will be back"}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a nice place to go to when guest are in town. It is a step above Olive Garden, but not as costly as Rao's. There is always a line, so that is a good sign that they are doing something right.

It has been more than two years since I have been able to get back to this Italian restaurant. I wanted to see if it is as good as I remembered. When a friend came into town, it was the perfect opportunity to visit. The wait was estimated for 30-45 minutes, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. They make a skinny sangria that tastes like fruit punch. It is lethal and easy to knock back. My friend ordered the frozen peach bellini and it tasted like a smoothie. Most of the drinks cost around 8-10 dollars. Not bad for being on the strip.

When we were sat, the server promptly greeted us and filled our water glasses. The service was impeccable. She was friendly, attentive, and non intrusive. 

We had ordered the calamari appetizer to give us some time to decide on our entree. Apparently it took some time to come out, but we did not notice. Caught up in our conversation and snacking on the bread made time go by quickly. 

Our waitress gave some great suggestions and I decided on a dish that would help the Make-a-Wish foundation. Right now, they have a few specialty items that Maggiano's will donate a portion of the proceeds to the charity. The roasted chicken farfalle is delicious. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente, the chicken moist, generous amounts of spinach, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, topped with parm slivers. The broth like sauce at the bottom made the dish light. I was happy that I could get something that was not cream based and not have to settle for marinara. My friend had ordered the chicken pesto pasta and it was good. You must love basil and pesto to get this meal because it is bold. I would order it again. 

Overall this was a nice meal. I would not hesitate to go back, but next time I will skimp on the bread to save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Overall 6.5 out of 10 , waitress was a 9, food was mediocre for Maggiano's, chicken Parmesan was over cooked, meatballs were warm, long waits but it did just opened up."}
{"text":"I got there prior to our reservation, so I sat at the bar for a drink, I was ignored for some time, even though there were a few people behind the bar, and the bar stools were half empty, so they weren't busy. Guess they don't like tips.
We had a very large group so they had to split us into 2 different tables. They miss counted the seats and left one out, a friend grabbed a chair and added it to the table, but we still had to wait for extra settings and menus. It took a while to get drink orders in, but water was at the tables already. I got an Arnold Palmer with Vodka, it was on the weak side but tasty. A friend got a Coke and said it was flat.
 Bread was served with plenty to go around. It was warm, soft and yummy. 
I got the Italian Salad, it was very average, the italian vinagrette was quite boring.
I ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni special, which I have had before, it was very good, lots of crab chunks and shrimp. Some friends got the Chicken Parmesean, the portions are huge, but they loved the food as well. No one at our table had a complaint about the food.
Most of us skipped desert. Roving musicians entertained us while we digested and others finished up their sweets.
Beautiful atmosphere, our waiter was great, food was pretty similar to most italian restaurants around."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is like the owner of a Denny's wanted to be a real restaurant owner, so he hired a focus group and had them talk about their most memorable Italian dining experience.

One dude raises his hand. \"Well, it was my anniversary, and my wife and I really ritzed it up. Fancy, expensive restaurant.\" \"Perfect,\" thinks the Denny's owner. \"Expensive and fancy is just the thing.\" He asks the dude what was fancy about it. Dude replies: \"I don't know. Two stories, clothe napkins, old timey big band in the background. Joint just looked expensive you know? Really treated us right. Made us feel special. Fond memories.\"

A woman raises her hand. \"Well, there's this little family Italian diner that I used to go to, and it seemed like every other time we'd visit the chef would come out and greet the patrons. Great service, friendly atmosphere.\" The Denny's owner jots down \"chef greets guests\" on his notepad.

Another fellow chimes in: \"The waitstaff at my favorite place will chip in a dessert or appetizer on the house. Just shows they think of you as more than a paying customer. Feels like real hospitality.\" The Denny's owner is excited by this idea.

A fourth panelist: \"This one spot would not only box up your leftovers, but they'd send you home with something else from the kitchen!\" The Denny's owner's eyes brighten at this suggestion. He is confident he has made an excellent decision in hiring the focus group.

He then bundled up all the ideas and made Maggianos, where you'll get great service and atmosphere in an upscale two story building with clothe napkins and big band in the background, a waiter who really treats you right, maybe throws something in on the house, and a chef who will come out and ask how your meal is going, and if you order right, they'll even send you home with something else from the kitchen.

The problem is, great service and atmosphere is garnish. It's a big, fancy pink bow on your birthday present. It's what we remember, but what Maggiano's forgot is that the most important part of a meal remains the meal.

Concisely, the food sucks. And no matter how good your service is, bad food is bad food. Every dish we had was heavy and bland, except for the dishes that were bland and heavy. Maggiano's is just a Denny's dressed up in patent Italian loafers faking an Italian accent.

Good sauce is the point of Italian food. The sauces sucked. The thing that sucked about them, is that they didn't taste good. That's really what I'm trying to get at with this review. The food, not good. We took home an alfredo and a lasagna. The half of the alfredo I haven't had yet will probably get tossed. I'll try the lasagna, but my expectations are low. The other dishes - a beef stroganoff type dish and another generic dish of some kind - were both bad. I couldn't find the calamari in the calamari appetizer. I might as well have just ordered deep-fried flour. Dessert was the exception to the rule. More proof this is actually a Denny's.

So that's Maggiano's for you. Great service, bad food, and a big check at the end. Won't be back unless someone pays me."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Nice middle to upscale place. Nice yeasty bread and wonderful service. I had the chicken francese. Tasty Parmesan crust with crispy potatoes and a really nice lemon sauce. It was a busy Friday night and the service was still very good. They asked if we had been there before and I had not, they brought a lovely complimentary two piece bruschetta out. Yum. They have a brunch menu that I noticed and will be checking that out soon. My only suggestion would be for some reason it seems to me the tables need a candle, a small electric votive would be perfect. Italian places just need them"}
{"text":"Review for the bar service and drinks. Have been there twice now - totally different experiences. First time, about a year ago was good. Fantastic bartender - bar was clean, service was spot on and appetizer was delicious. He checked on us regularly, kept waters full.

Second time was completely the opposite. Stopped in for a drink and appetizer around 6 on a Thursday. Hostess and host were very nice and welcoming. Headed to the bar area, 2 bartenders and about 3 staff standing at the end of bar. There were only 2 clean tables so picked one of those, figured they just finished a rush. The tables remained dirty for the duration. We waited for 10 minutes at least for service. Out table had crumbs all over he did wipe those up with a stinky towel. He was ok, not knowledgeable about the wines. When we got our drinks my friends glass was dirty, he elected to drink out of the bottle. My wine glass was dirty, I drank it after wiping the outside. We decided to pass on food at this point. Bartendress was not friendly, no welcome or hello - her bar was a mess. 

At about 6:45 the other \"help\" started announcing on each other \"time to breakdown\" and began cleaning back bar. Conversation behind the bar was not customer friendly. I was seriously blown away by the lack of professional behavior or manners. Other people did come into bar for drinks and dinner - the bar a job or whatever took their drink orders with dirty plates in her hands (finally started clearing). Overall the bar area was unkept, unprofessional and lackluster. Literally had cartons of baby wipes on the bar - gross.

Will give it one more shot in a month or two."}
{"text":"Good location, right at Fashion Show Mall. Fantastic Italian food, prices are not to bad either"}
{"text":"We had a bottle of Malbec to start off, we enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken  Marsala.  The bread was hot and the sever was outstanding!"}
{"text":"You know the Lens Crafters slogan, \"Ready in about an hour\".  I was waiting at the mercy of the glasses gods, not really in the mood to shop, so I decided to talk a stroll to the other end of the mall for a glass of wine.  I considered each of the different restaurant options, but with the main goal in mind, wine, I opted for Maggiano's.  

The rest of the mall was sparse, but you would never guess it was a Tuesday night upon entering.  The joint was hopping.  I found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list.  I usually start with a white, but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset.  After a brief study, I requested a glass of Meiomi Pinot Noir.  Score!!  Now, what to do with my hands while I sit here, but of course, an appetizer!  All of my friends can attest that I've been on a calamari quest of late.  Not surprising, I opt for the calamari.

While I'm kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice, the fellow next to me, a tourist from Connecticut, strikes up a lively conversation.  I discover he works for the Travel Channel, has an exact opposite wine palate from me, and we were both at the same event last Saturday (the Lee's 9th annual Wine Experience).

Perfecto!  Little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive.  Pair them with Maggiano's famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic, onion, and basil and I'm one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything.  The Lens Crafters notification call comes and goes, but I'm not ready to leave just yet, so I order up another glass of wine.  This time I order up a Cline Ancient Vines Zin, which isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"So I called there today and asked what their corkage fee was? (we prefer to bring our own premier bottle of wine!)   Was told \"you cannot bring your own bottle of Wine\".  I canceled our Reservation on the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in most US states.
Yes, it's just typical, hearty Italian dishes.
Yes, it gets pretty packed here at this particular one.
And yes, I had a pretty awesome experience here even though I would have preferred to dine at a Michelin starred or famous celebrity chef's restaurant here in LV.

I joined some of my old colleagues from my previous job here for dinner during the Interop convention. We had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously NO parking problem. :)

We had a table reserved for about 6 of us and we were seated promptly. The place was JAMPACKED for a weeknight. But everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service. It can definitely get pretty damn loud here.

We ordered tons of different pasta, chicken, seafood and dessert dishes. Everything served family style of course. Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small. But when dessert came out...I opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself AND of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table.

Our waiter/waitresses were all very friendly. And service was quite efficient.

Would I dine at this particular Maggiano's again? Hmmm, well I have about a million bookmarked spots to try out, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that I already know it's standard Italian food. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well-known chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok.. Seriously, you should know what you are going to get food wise if you are going to a Maggiano's.  Big Portions, big belly, and a big doggy bag.  They serve whale size meals there.. It's awesome for us gluttons.  Other than that, I want to comment on the service.  I was so impressed with the service that I had to get my waiter's full name to throw up here on Yelp.  Robert Bouche.  Ask for ROBERT BOUCHE.  He was wonderful.  Completely took care of us without being slightly annoying.  His suggestions were thoughtful and relevant to what we told him we liked.  It was a real treat to have a such a good server.  It really does make the experience a whole lot better.  Enjoy!

{"text":"Meh. Went there for Memorial Day for party of 14 friends & family. First and last time here ever. Half of us arrived @1pm to make reservations & was told by host it would be about 30 min via text notification. Sure. Np. We waited next to the bar area while waiting for the rest of our party who all arrived @1:30 pm. The restaurant didn't look full there's was a few spots available throughout especially on the mall patio side & the bar had 2 patrons. 
We finally got seated @2:50pm lol they kept telling us they were just waiting for the current party to leave so they can group a few tables together. The mngr could've at least gave us some bread rolls n water while we waited right? Nope. He's nowhere to be found. I had to flag down a random server for that.
They made all 14 of us wait for almost 90min just to \"bunch a few tables\" together. I asked if we could all seat outside at the mall area patio since no one was there I was told by the blonde host that it wasn't open, really? on Memorial Day for party of 14 it ain't available? For reals? 
They finally sat all 14 of us at this \"combined table\" that looked like it was meant for 10 people it was so uncomfortable. Our server had this condescending tone from her the entire time. The food was ok. I had the surf & turf which for $49 u only get 8oz fillet mignon & 8oz lobster tail & side of clarified butter & lemon, it was meh, that's all u get it could've used a side salad & roasted potatoes vegetables or something I could've gone to Bellagio for that price & had unlimited king crab legs lol.
If u plan on coming here make sure yaal make ur reservations way ahead in advance to avoid this kind of mess yikes! Bad experience overall  never again."}
{"text":"We went to Maggiano's for the first time when we were in Las Vegas recently.  Despite the long wait (we were seated about an hour after our reservation was scheduled), the wait was worth it.  I had the Lobster Carbonara.  I cannot emphasize enough how AWESOME it was.  It honestly is the best pasta dish I have EVER had.  I thought it was a bit overpriced when looking at the menu, but I would absolutely get it again.  FANTASTIC.  Be prepared for a wait for a table, but from our experience, you won't be disappointed with the food.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 stars for food. -.5 stars for terrible, TERRIBLE service and cramped dining area.

Had reservations last Saturday night party of 11.  When we arrived our table wasn't ready, which was fine, but my relative, who is wheel chair bound really had nowhere to wait for 10 minutes since it was really busy that night.  They tell us to wheel her to an area adjacent to the host stand.  A few minutes pass and my fiance gets reprimanded by two different servers that we cannot stand there.  We were not blocking the path to the computers, either. AND WE WERE TOLD TO WAIT THERE! 

We get seated shortly after that, and we make it easy and order the classic family style dinner for everyone.  2 salads, 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts.  Honestly, it is so much food, you are better off getting things a la carte for the table.  For $27 per person, what you get is really greasy, overly cheesed, americanized Italian food, with most of the pastas arriving to the table over cooked, dining area very very cramped and so loud you will lose your voice, and just so-so servers. I understand it being busy, but I have been here several times in the past few years, and this always seems to be the case. You would think with a large party you would at least come by to check on drinks.  I sat with my cocktail glass empty after my first one and I saw empty water and drink glasses all around. 

Salmon is okay, so is the fried mozzarella app,the chicken parm, and the apple dessert.  The veal and mushroom ravioli has a funky mushroom flavor and a cream sauce that is a little salty and very heavy, blegh, soggy salads. blegh.

If you have a larger party, request the private rooms in the back, that is much quieter, otherwise you will feel like someone is about to hit the back of your chair the entire meal."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and we came in with a party of 19. We made a reservation a month prior and we were lucky enough to save a spot for a Friday dinner. We got seated right away as soon as we got there. To minimize chaos, we didn't order ala carte and decided for the \"family style\" menu. For the amount of money spent, it was well worth it. The family style includes a salad, an appetizer, 4 main dish, and 2 desserts! The portions were more than enough for us to devour that we ended taking leftovers home. Nathan and Maggie were our servers and they were the best! Our glasses were never empty and they checked how we were doing on numerous times. I never had to call them on anything since they were always on sight. I will definitely coming back and recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken parm along with some bruschetta. Also did the meal deal for 49.00 and that is worth the price with the extra meals you receive to take home!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Maggianos but this is the first time I had a poor experience. I do understand that there is a major convention in town and things can get loud and crowded. The staff can be overwhelmed and I believe that happened tonight. Our waiter was too much in a rush. He was very helpful to the rest of my party but pretty much ignored my drink order. When he did give me attention, I asked for Sam Adams Oktoberfest. I got regular Sam Adams. The thing that bothered me the most is how he told us about the availability specials and the one thing I wanted to order on the regular menu was no longer available.  Nothing was said about it earlier. At that point I felt like possibly not having a meal. My party talked me into finding something else to eat. The meal went fine after that. Usually a manager stops by to see how things are going but due to the volume and a few large parties we only saw him at at the door as we were leaving. Will I go to another Maggianos? yes. Will I go to this one?...probably not. Not during a convention."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum pretty much sums up my Maggiano's experience. I went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees. I was not disappointed in any of them. The highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful. There was a spinach salad that tasted like a party in my mouth, with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits. The entrees were equally gratifying, my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach (cooked to absolute perfection) and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce. The Chicken Parmesan was also a front runner, the chicken breasts were pounded so thin, yet still juicy and moist. 

I will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall!!!"}
{"text":"I took the family here for Mother's Day and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The server was friendly, and quick to bring us our food and drinks, despite how busy they were. The food as always was delicious. We got the lasagna as usual because it never disappoints. We also got the baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo which were equally great. We all left there fat and happy including the kids who can be hard to please sometimes. We look forward to returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Check your statements!!!! We recently went for my sister in laws birthday dinner and to our surprise a couple of days later there was an extra $8.68 added on when we clearly left the tip in cash!!  We are locals we know to leave tips on cash to help them out!!! Service was awful and the tip wasn't necessary, but we did anyway! Called the manager and he stated \"we are human we all make mistakes\" so how many others have had this happen!!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  When on a late Saturday afternoon for lunch.   Very attentive service and food was delicious with HUGE portions.  Clean, nice atmosphere.   I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Spent our one year anniversary lunch here while in Vegas.  We couldn't really decide where to go and were in the mood for Italian so we decided to give it a try.  We were seated immediately and our server was extremely nice and attentive with great recommendations.  

We started with garlic bread - garlicky but not overwhelming.  It was good.  I had the chicken marsala, which I really enjoyed, the chicken was moist and the marsala sauce was just enough.  My boyfriend had the baked ziti and he really enjoyed the pasta as well - it was al dente with the right amount of sauce/sausage/cheese.  

Overall, it was a good experience.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Love this new location! The food was amazing!! And the service outstanding! Our waiter Alex was on top of it! Never an empty cup and always attentive. Great atmosphere and the price was fair. Great value!"}
{"text":"Went to maggianos with my mom and we shared the Chicken and spinach manicotti and the chicken francese for dinner. The francese was better, manicotti was a little bland. But all in all everything was delicious. We also got to pick something to take home. My mom got a portion of lasagna and I got mushroom ravioli. Delicious. We also got creme brûlée to share for dessert. So good! Love this place. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has four stars, which I think is a little high if you're judging based on taste, but value for your money, this is definitely good value.

I came here a couple nights ago with a very large group (about 14?). We showed up without notice, and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so. The table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course, but can have as much of those courses as you want until you're ready for the next one. We ordered calamari, caesar salad, another type of salad (I think it was the Maggiano's), tomato with mozarella, chicken parmesan, lasagna, spaghetti with marinara sauce, salmon, tiramisu, and cheesecake. The salads were decent - crisp, and tangy. The mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too 'pizza mozarella' tasting for me. The spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite, along with some of the other people at the table. It was light, and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness. The lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant, crumbly way. It wasn't chewy, cheesy, and meshing with the lasagna layers. 

The cheesecake was really delicious, came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Mm!

The service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us, but it was fairly busy in the restaurant, so I can understand.

I'd come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats, but I wouldn't come here for a date or a small intimate group meal."}
{"text":"While coming back from Sedona my wife and I decided to pick up Maggiano's. It was on our way back to Chandler and Italian sounded good. I pulled up their menu online, wrote down what we wanted, and called while we were north of Anthem.

I was placed on hold... for 6 minutes. Now we're past Anthem.
I hung up and called back. I had to interrupt the hostess by saying I wanted to place a pickup order. She transferred me... more waiting... Now we're on the 101 and would have to wait there for our meals.

The guy who answered had no idea what was on their menu. He kept getting confused on what I was trying to do \"I need to pick up three meals in 25 minutes\" was not in his wheelhouse. He transferred me again after a minute long conversation that he muffled by placing the phone against his shirt. Then another girl got on and said \"why don't you just order three meals?\"

By this time we were at the 101 and nearing Scottsdale road. I called ahead to avoid waiting as we were dirty from bike riding and hiking.

I gave up. We went to Olive Garden after going home and cleaning up, and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars? I really wanted to like this place, especially that it had a nice seating area (with the mall though), and the waiter service was really excellent!! Though, the food... I wasn't expecting this from a 4 yelp stars rated restaurant!!

I took the lamb loin, and my wife took the salmon salad: both of our plates were less than average! I was really disappointed by the taste, and the texture of the lamb and the salmon. I wondered the freshness of this fish and meat. Additionally, along with the lamb, came some mashed potatoes that had literally no taste. 

My review, in other words; the chef has a lot of room for improvement!!"}
{"text":"Top notch ....
The Zucchini with lemon aioli was a show stopper  
Great food the carbonara was fantastic the egg on top literally....
Gnocchi with sausage ....
Huge and delicious...
The lasagna was huge and the best tasting ...
Def go to....
The service was spectacular"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Happy Hour (3-6 pm), you can get their flatbreads for half off.
Service was friendly  and efficient.

My only wish is that that food selection for happy hour would be a bit larger.

I know Maggiano's is known for gigantic family style portions similar in style to Bucca di Beppo.  I was pleasantly surprised however to find a miniature tiramisu on their menu which was very tasty and not too rich."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner as well as happy hour/dinner and this location lives up to the great brand name. Yeah a lot of it is basic Italian food but isn't that what people like? The menu is still very large for food and drinks so it shouldn't be hard to find something really good. The shrimp pasta and chicken parm dishes are great. I also like that the service is usually pretty good compared to most restaurants in the area. It seems like management actually cares here."}
{"text":"From the experience I've had here so far it's been great. There's nothing to complain about, all I got  to say is that the Tiramisu is the best, I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Won a gift card so I came here to check it out. A born and raised NY'er who grew up with homemade Italian food and who can make their own at any time.  This place isn't bad but the parking is a gigantic hassle at the Fashion Show Mall.  My usual Italian spot has free valet at The Forum Shops. Food was reasonably priced and service was good. Would I come here again? Well, if a motor vehicle is involved, then I'm headed to Caesars which is so much easier to deal with than this place. If I'm in the areas on foot and hungry, I'll go back into this place. Gave it three stars because of the parking and secondly, it's not as good as Carmines but it does not suck.  Prices are cheaper though than Carmine's but so are the portions."}
{"text":"I went to Beachwood Maggianos last minute fri. at 10pm. There were still people dining and I was starving after a busy day. Took a while for the waitress to take my order but it was worth waiting for. She brought me 1 piece of bread and said there is some hot fresh bread coming. Good bread is very important to me and when it came it was great. I had seen an advertisement on Facebook for the Denver Steak so decided to give it a try. Very tender and flavorful without much fat. The vegetables were good but could have been a little hotter. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect and I ate every drop. Love the nice touch of the complimentary Lemon Cookies. I ended up taking the cookies home and enjoyed them the next day since I was so full. All in all it was a great dinner and I gave them a little slack since it was so late. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We dined for a Bday dinner on 3/3 of this week with a party of 13. We did have a reservation and were happily seated on time. Apparently this seems to be an issue here. Our waitress Taylor came by and took drink orders and started to explain their family style ordering then walked to get our drinks. In a bit she returned to ask about our orders and came to our end of the table and said the Birthday girl said she wants Family Style dinner so decide what entrees you are going to share. I interrupted and said what if we don't want that? I looked down at my Sis-in-law and told her we couldn't do that. We wanted something else less expensive. The waitress seemed dumbfounded and said she would have to go check if they would allow. After finding that to be completely Dumb, we wondered if she was ever coming back. All this time the waitresses attitude was growing more and more rude. Maybe she was having a bad day but this was early evening at 6:45 at this point. She didn't seem to like it that she couldn't run the show. Sorry it's our dinner and my $$. We ended up ordering separate and no one could order family style. They thought we would over share. 
Our appetizers didn't come out all together, they were fairly staggered. Our Muscles were wonderful and the other parties calamari was so-so. 
Further into the nite the waitress got better as did her attitude but we were almost agreed in not tipping her she was so rude at the start. My Bro-in-law was so upset he left the restaurant. 
I doubt we'll ever be back. 
Oh the rest of the food - way to salty"}
{"text":"This place is a gem you can never go wrong with there pasta and sea food... came here for New Years food was Amazing and the best is there chocolate cake must have ."}
{"text":"Decor is classy, old Vegas with a polished feel, very clean.
Service professionals were just that; professional, engaging and friendly.  
Food was very good.  We had the chef's special all around.
Only draw back was the wait for our food, but, it was busy, so really not a problem.  
Ernesto our host and Kevin our waiter were both on point.  Kevin was especially helpful and even accommodated a appetizer swap.  
Military discount eased the bill.  Classy place, good food, would go back."}
{"text":"Went here for new year's eve with a bunch of friends.  They have it set up perfectly.  Fine dining at it's best.  The food is absolutely the best Italian food I have ever had. And the veal,  forget about it.  I've been bragging about this place since I was there."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a romantic dinner. Food is great and the portion size is also awesome! Did wait about 10 min. for a seat but obviously what do you expect, it's an amazing restaurant! Amazing food as well as amazing host's. The lady who helps us was named Mariana I think and she was so nice and helpful . Coming here again no doubt !"}
{"text":"I was able to dine here on a pleasant Sunday night and thought it was alright.

The environment that I was in had a good vibe.  I happened to have patio seating and felt like the lights were lite up to a good amount.  It wasn't too dark to where I wasn't able to see my food, and also not too bright to where the light would be blinding.  It was just right.

I did enjoy a big of their bread.  It wasn't too hard, just right.  The calamari ordered wasn't anything extraordinary.  The sauce that came with it seemed a bit bland for my taste though.  I was a little saddened because I always love calamari.  For my entree, I had ordered the Chicken Marsala, and again it was bland.  I felt like I couldn't really get a taste of anything and kept adding some pepper.  All in all, it was just an alright kind of place for me."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Had our holiday party here and are frequent diners :) Johnny is a great server. Try the apple dessert! So good"}
{"text":"Good food , good service perfect for date night! We love to dine here late at night since the restaurant  has a nice strip view, from appetizers to desserts everything is delicious"}
{"text":"I love the food here but this experience wasn't as great as it was in the past. I made a reservation and when we arrived we were told that there weren't any tables available. It wasn't even that busy! But we waited patiently for about 20 minutes so that wasn't horrible. And then our cocktails took at least 20 minutes to arrive at the table. Once we ordered, my soup came out eventually. I had two bites and then the entrees came out. By the time I finished my soup, the cheese on my pasta was no longer hot. Gross. Overall it wasn't a terrible experience, but the previous times were much better. I guess that's why I gave the 3 stars. It wasn't terrible... Just made my eye twitch"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Maggiano's, you aren't living right. Go with a group and order Family Style (on the back of the menu). It's bottomless, so you keep eating and they bring more. It's delicious and you won't regret it. I think it is a really good Italian place."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants period!...but here is the skinny on Maggiano's, I had the opportunity to eat here with a small group and a large group and you would think the experience would be better with a smaller group....think again, the menu is different and you definitely know you are eating at a chain restaurant. Food was heavy loaded with sauces and it's obvious there are lots of can openers in the kitchen.   Now believe it or not when you have 15-20 people they serve a family style dinner and the food is a higher quality and the good pasta's, the sausage &pepper appetizer is great! But the most impressive is the deserts...what a presentation! and delicious.  There house Chianti is great for the price, I highly recommend it. 

The service is also much better with a larger group....go figure."}
{"text":"Food amazing!

Service amazing!

Price very good too for so fancy place.
 Every week i visit there because the food and the service are the best!"}
{"text":"Maggino's in downtown Summerlin is always a great place for dinner and brunch on weekends. We have dined here before several times for dinner, always a great experience (hint - the restaurant has great specials that gives you your meal and a meal to take home) and the wait staff have told us about their brunch so today we decided to try it.

Menu - The menu had some great options for brunch with the restaurant  putting their spin on classics like chicken and waffles and unique dishes to include Maggiano's meatball. 

My wife ordered off of the restaurants dinner menu and ordered Chicken Marsala. What caught my eye was the 5 different versions of Eggs Benedict so I tried their crab cake Benedict. It was excellent, I was kind of optimistic with a fish and eggs, but honestly was very happily surprised. The holindase sauce combined with he crab cake meshed really well. 

As normal, the service is on point. The staff here is always very mellow, able to carry on a conversation while still taking care of their tables. At the time of our meal, the restaurant was about 70% occupied, however the staff is attentive so you never feel like you will wait for anything. 

I know the restaurant has the ability to host large parties and has a big separate area for special events. In conclusion, if your in Downtown Summerlin, I would highly recommend giving Maggiano's a try. Last hint, be prepared to take some home as portion are large for individual meals, there are also family style dining options."}
{"text":"Very predictable and reliable.  My husband and I have dined at Maggiano's in San Jose (Santana Row) near our house several times and also in Orlando Florida.  We decided for our last night in Vegas we wanted something affordable, reliable and relatively quick- we had show tickets and had gotten back late from our tour.

The Concierge at Encore called to get us a reservation and we were seated right at our reservation time (we got there early just in case), but we had plenty of time without feeling rushed.  We ordered the mozzarella appetizer, which was delicious.  Husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit!   An affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees, my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips!  He said they were wonderful and they came with mashed potatoes with shoestring onion ring crisps- bit he was too full to eat the sides.   I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious! 

We passed again on dessert- simply no room because the food during dinner was plentiful!     

The location is very central- right on the corner of the strip across from the Wynn hotel- which was perfect for us considering we were staying at Encore and had tickets to the show at Wynn.    We would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Mahi mahi taco plate came with a whole fillet, flavorful rice and black beans. The best part was the pile of small homemade corn tortillas. Best fish tacos I've had in a long while.  It's on the strip with a great outdoor ambiance & good people watching."}
{"text":"I have used Maggiano's for meeting functions for over 10 years.  This location is in need of understanding customer service.  I miss the excellent service received from Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston locations.  I won't use this location anymore for my meetings when held in Las Vegas.  I don't think that any of the banquet staff have ever attended a meeting to know what needs and expectations are needed to fulfill a successful event.  I wish them the best...I am moving on."}
{"text":"This review is a little late but promised I'd eventually write it.. a group of friends and I visited this location on March 22nd. Our waitress, a young lady named Taylor, was great. The sous chef came out to our table to personally introduced himself and offer us a complimentary appetizer. We were celebrating two birthdays and had brought our own dessert but again they brought out some complimentary desserts as well. I ordered the 2 for 1 and the waitress threw out my leftovers and replaced it with a brand new one for me to take home. Overall our experience was nothing less of fantastic. We all left to our fundraising school event next door very happy and pleased. Thank you"}
{"text":"Main Course
I tasted Mom's Lasgna, Spaghetti with Meatball and they were really good. There is always the one on one free dish with classic menu. Loved their ambiance. We (five people ) were little cramped there. Some tables are too close to each other. The service was really good and friendly. Although, I was hoping for better garlic bread, I have tasted the best one at Olive Garden. Rest was all good.  
Deserts:
Deserts were also awesome. I already had researched yelp for deserts and they did not disappoint me. Tiramisu was ok; Pound cake with caramelized banana was really great."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner - just me and the hubby.  Every time we come out to Vegas we come here.  Great place, love the food, scenery was very nice and italian of course.  Waiters was great.  Very little wait time.  If you never been there before and don't know where to park it can be tricky or you will be walking for a while before you get there.
Hubby and I had a great romantic time.  Been going there since 2003, every visit to vegas we always make sure we stop here.
This is great mouth watering italian food.  My fav dish is the Rigatoni 'D' &
We love the calamari!!"}
{"text":"WHAT A CHANGE!    My friend and I had the best dinner here we have had ever together.  We both had pasta and take home pasta.  We had a bottle of wine and the dessert where you get a mini of every single dessert.   Everything was on point and the service was beyond exceptional I am so glad that I gave it a second chance.   I can't wait to come in again.   I can't thank the staff and management enough!"}
{"text":"We sat at the tables by the bar and for a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy, but food took a really long time to come out.  It took so long in fact that we decided to tell our waitress, Sarah, to just box it up to go.

We ordered the buy one and take a second complimentary meal home. I went with Eggplant Parmesan for both entrees.  I was going to change it up a bit and order the vegetable primavera alfredo, but decided against it at the last moment.. because I love eggplant parm and spaghetti.. can't go wrong with that dish.  The food was delicious.  The only thing I was surprised that the meal(s) didn't come with a salad.  Olive Garden has a similar deal, but their first meal comes with a large fresh, tasty salad and breadsticks.  We did eat bread and olive oil while waiting. It took probably 45 minutes for our food and checks to finally come out."}
{"text":"Wedding rehearsal dinner in the banquet area upstairs. Everything was set up beautifully, and the food was delicious. Jimmy (our server) was so much fun and took excellent care of us. 

For our event, food was served family style, which was very enjoyable and meant we didn't have to get up for a buffet. Conversation could continue while we passed platters/bowls of food. Just like being at home, without having to cook!

Restrooms are conveniently located on the same floor, and there is an elevator for those who can't manage the stairs. 

I would definitely recommend this venue for a similar event."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Waitress was kind of slow but still attentive."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Ive never been so satisfied with the food, service, and atmosphere of a restaurant like this. My waitress Laura was amazing and went the extra mile to make sure i had a great birthday dinner. The lasagna was the best ive ever had. First time going here and im in love! Food came fast and was definitely worth the reasonable price. Wasn't terribly crowded and the restaurant itself was classy and roomy and not too loud. Great experience overall!!"}
{"text":"Favorite of all my favorite places to eat! Go to for any family celebration! Food is always excellent! Calamari is to die for-melts in your mouth! I'm a fan of all the pasta! Never had a bad dish yet! Wine list is great! Love the Cafe Zin! You cannot go wrong with any of the desserts! Trust me, this is well worth the money and wait!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I use to come here as a native to Las Vegas. To the point: The service was fabulous, our waiter was an older gentleman, good looking, very nice man! But the food... Blah. My papadelé noodles were over done, they were stuck together, mind you this was for Shrimp Fra Divalo, those noodles are for thick gravies, not delicate shrimp dishes. *Rant. The shrimp was luke warm and the \"gravy\" had taken on a matte look from sitting on the serving counter for too long. Sadly... They weren't even busy. I'll pass next time. You should too."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and good service but I think the restaurant takes on more customers then they can handle. I ordered the special Sea Bass, it was cold and rubbery underneath. All it came with was a little bit of risotto for $33. My mom's shrimp dish looked like the shrimp wash dumped right onto her plate from the shrimp boats met and came with hardly any pasta, too much shrimp.. Terrible Presentation! Next time I take an out of town guest to have Italian food we will definitely be going to the Italian American Club for dinner and music! I will never go back to Maggianos. I was disappointed, since it had been on my bucket list for months to have dinner there"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Prices are reasonable, but on the high end. Ambiance is nice. Service was SUPER slow on an uncrowded Wednesday night. Server Nicole was inattentive and paced the meal poorly. If you have time and a different waiter, could be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  A bit pricey but,  it is on the main strip of Las Vegas.  It was really packed and if we did not call and make reservations ahead of time,  we wouldn't have been able to eat there.  The wait was way to long.  But now that I have eaten there...  I would definitely go back if in vegas again!"}
{"text":"I go here every now and then when my parents are in town because I can get a seat very easily and get my food quickly.  They recently changed the dinner and wine menu that bumped the prices up a little bit, but the items I always get are still the same price.  I always order the simple dishes that let you take an additional one home as well for free!  My mom does as well so I always have great leftovers for a couple days after this visit.  I usually can finish my first meal either so that comes home as well.  They give you instructions on how to cook the meal once home so that is nice of them.  The service is great here and there is plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"We came here for some great Italian food, and that's exactly what we got.  The restaurant is large, has a great layout, with a variety of seating options, from loud, to intimate, view or inside one of the interior dining rooms.  We took Uber to get there, so we didn't have any parking issues. Our party of 4 adults ordered a variety of entries and appetizers.  The appetizers were good, but the Calamari was way to typical, heavily breaded and just blah. For the entries, the Gnocchi and Cioppino were great, the Veal Parmigiana was out of this world.  We were short on time, so didn't try any deserts, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I am giving what would have been a zero star review 4 stars ONLY because of the excellent service provided by manager Kristie Miller. As locals, our group of 4 was well aware that we would need reservations for a busy Saturday night.  When we called at about 5pm to make reservations we were told \"we can get you in now or at 9pm.\" We immediately went on open table and booked a reservation for 6:30pm. So, clearly, the hostess stand and open table seem to have some miscommunication.  Once we arrived we were escorted to our patio table but another couple cut in front of us and took our seats. Our host went over to talk to them and came back with his apologies and confusion.  He said \"they did have reservations as well but just sat themselves.\" While the appropriate action would have been to tell them they must be escorted and seated by a host, they just let them have their way. Fine, we didn't want to make an issue of it and just wanted to get on with our evening. We were then sat at another patio table that was filthy with food remnants and bird feces. We let the host know immediately and he said someone would be by shortly. After about 5 minutes of sitting there at our wobbly table (we looked underneath and it was being held on with electrical tape!!!) we'd had enough! One of our party went to address our issues and horrible experience thus far and were promptly seated at a different patio table by Kristie Miller. She was apologetic and friendly. Our server Gary was very fun and attentive. The chef even came out to discuss a special request one of our party had placed. Thank you all for making what started out as a zero-star experience a pleasant evening. Kudos to Kristie for turning this one around!"}
{"text":"My family had dinner here after my daughter was married. My daughter and I both have food allergies. My daughter is allergic to pine nuts and olives (olives are life threatening) and I'm allergic to all dairy. Our waitress and the chef went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. We will go here again for our next big celebration."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Some of the worse Italian food I ever had. Our waiter was great.  The sauce tasted like jar sauce. The chicken picatta was dry and no flavor. Very disappointed and a $100 check."}
{"text":"The size of the part is abnormally large, so the value for money is definitely good. The dose was very pleasant, and the food was very hot. The server was friendly and always polite."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on a monday so it was dead, great conversation with the bartender... had a few glasses of $5 wine and ordered two flat breads which were well worth it for $4, even had leftovers. I love eating here, food and service are always excellent."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Italian places. And the location is great (since I love close). They always have specials, including the 2 for $42. You get an app to split, two entrees, dessert, and two entrees to take home. Who can beat that deal?

My favorite pasta which everyone should try. The rigatoni D."}
{"text":"We have been going to the one at Fashion Show mall for years and we are so happy they are up in Summerlin now. Food is always consistently good and staff very pleasant. The Filet is excellent and the pastas are always good not to mention the bread too! Great family place. We go at least twice a month it is that good."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, professional and very courteous waitress. Chicken parmigiano was excellent, strong drinks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the service, food, and atmosphere. This is authentic Italian.

We sat at the bar and received prompt and attentive service. Drinks were well prepared. Wine suggestions right on the money for the taste and dryness I desire. We were offered complimentary break, but having already snacked elsewhere, we declined.

I ordered the baked ziti with meat sauce and my husband ordered the spaghetti and meatball with meat sauce. Their red sauce is simply devine. I am a fan of Italian food and homestyle is my favorite. Maggiano's took me there. I have not dined (even other places of fame from TV programs) anywhere else in the valley where the sauce was as authentic. It had the best notes of salt, sweet, fresh, and thick anyone could desire. There was a lot of sausage in the baked ziti. My only suggestion would be more cheese melted on top - because I am a fan of cheese. However, the grated cheese (mix of parmesan/romano) was also fresh and tasty. It was nothing like the store-brands, nor the pompous shavings you find at other places. What I especially liked was the full flavor it added to the already wonderful sauce.

Best part - those mini desserts. How affordable and how cute! I love being able to taste multiple items upon a first visit. And I did because I received a free to-go spaghetti order. The box it up for you - and you can mix and match from the same section on the menu. Apparently, if you get take out, the second dinner is only $5 more! 

I ate pasta for 4 additional meals and that is fine by me.

If you are in the neighborhood, definitely give this place a go. Especially, if you're a fan of fresh, authentic Italian cuisine. I will be back and soon."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent. My favorite eggplant dish is here although I had them salmon-salad and we took the \"extra meal\" as eggplant home ! We rarely eat pasta but my boyfriend was in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs.  It's always too much food for us but tasty. Service at the bar where we sat was very attentive."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, it was so good!! For the amount of food you get the price is well worth it! I had spaghetti Marana and it was the best spaghetti I have ever had. My husband had lasagna and loved it. We had a really nice server and we did the meal for two so we got to each take home a pasta. We will be coming back here. We each got a teas, salad, pastas and then pastas to take home and a dessert and it was only $54."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate Jan 1, the entry of the year. We did not have reservations like the front girl asked but for a busy night, we managed to get a really good table, with a view and right next to the window. 

I only had a Chicken Ceasar salad with English tea, which was just really good. I had just gotten out of work so tea was good to relax, and when I got home it worked :) . . . The Ceasar was BIG, I mean a massive amount. 

One of the people I went with ordered the special which was Rosemary chicken lemon. I tried some and the chicken was not at all dry it had a very nice taste of rosemary. The mashed potatoes had a sort of herb in them possibly cilantro mixed in. Not sure. 

The other person I went with had the Salmon salad, she said it was a bit dry. I'm not sure if that's what it was supposed to be. 

You get complimentary white bread that definitely hardens very quickly LOL. 

Ever since I've been ordering out, like Zucchini. Which is all very good. I mean they have a BIG amount, so an appetizer to go is good enough. 

The server that helped us out that night was extremely polite, and although we asked for a section that definitely seemed it wasn't his he walked over to us many times to check. Very nice and again he walked extra, for a busy night every step you take counts. But it was appreciated. 

The ambiance is very loud, people not so much the restaurant or servers, or music but the people it was SOOO loud. Maybe, everyone, there is used to it, but it would've been nice not have that I had this really stressful day at work, since it was the end of the season. I needed quietness and relaxing. 

BUT when ordering out during lunchtime it's nice and calm. HArdly anything happening. You have to walk to the very back of the restaurant to order but they are usually quick about 5 to 10 minutes. 

I'm sure I'd love to try the rest of the menu in the future. Thank you."}
{"text":"Always great food, & even better service.  Never had a single issue in the past.

The tiramisu is the absolute best, hands down."}
{"text":"We went here last Thursday around 7pm and goooooood loooooord was it a long wait for a table.  I was surprised this place was as packed as it was.  Definitely make a reservation..even on a Thursday!

Aside from that the food was decent.  The wife went for the lasagna after rave reviews from my 78 year old coworker who said it was the best he'd ever had.  It was ok.  A little too sausagey and I thought lasagna was supposed to have lasagna noodles in it???  I went with the calamari marinara/arrabiata or whatever which was pretty good...but Nora's is better and $5 less.  

Portions are huge here, its nice they offer half sizes but I would still opt for the \"regular\" portions since leftovers (ie 2nd meal) is worth having.    You could easily just split a salad and entree with another person and be full.  

I still prefer Nora's and Battista's over this place but its not bad.  I give it 3.5"}
{"text":"Terrible hosting staff. Not friendly. Paged us to be sat so we gave the host our pager and then she asked us to stand by a door that was crowded just for a manager to ask after we were waiting if we were sent up. When I said yes, he asked for our name and our party size and then walked away and didn't come back. After, a hostess comes up asking for our party but the name wasn't us. She kept saying the last name of our party but could t confirm the size just for the party name not to even be Kim. The party waiting next to me that was sent to this door was also as frustrated as my party. Finally a third person asked us if we were paged to the front, asked our name, looked puzzled so she went to the ladies that sent us to the door. Eureka! They figured out how to seat us. And We passed multiple tables our size that were open to fit my size group. How can 5 hostesses and 1 manager no figure out reservation and seating. Our server was delayed to greet us but friendly when she did. Unfortunately, first impressions are everything."}
{"text":"So, my dad said this Italian eatery in Vegas was one of the best Italian foods he has eaten before. Since my mom and I didn't really know what we wanted to eat for lunch, it was a why not kind of thing. We got there and was seated  within 5 mins, granted this was a lunch hour so i'm guessing there were fewer people there. 

Personally, i didn't like our waiter. He sounded insincere. i know that they don't really care whether you've eaten there or not, or if the food it good or not, just act better.

We ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer; i really liked it. My mom ordered the shrimp and crab imperial; that was yummy. My dad ordered some lobster alfredo; that was also delicious. I ordered a steak bruschetta(sp?) and it was absolutely delightful! it was the right portion and i loved eating it. since i'm not a food expert, that's all i can give with the food.
The blood orange italian soda tasted good too; it comes in a fancy bottle.

Overall, i much enjoyed this restaurant ^.^, but if i ever want to eat legit italian food, it would be at my friend's house."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and really enjoyed the food. I tried the crab cakes, which I really enjoyed even though I'm not a big fan of seafood. I had the Chicken and spinach stuffed Manicotti and loved it. The bathrooms were pretty dirty but it was late at night when we went. The service was good and we had a really good time there."}
{"text":"Homestyle italian food and great ambiance.  The wait staff is pleasant, service is great, and the food couldn't be any better.  It's affordably priced, and if you order off of the classics menu, you get a full size 2nd plate to take home with you.  Seriously, how could it get better!?"}
{"text":"I would give 10 stars if I could. Even better Raphael was one best waiters I've had in years. He almost told me ingredients he was so precise. Top notch food. Thank you guys for the experience on my annerversary. Food was amazing of course!!"}
{"text":"For an Italian big box chain, Maggiano's is one of the better ones out there. For me, our night went from fun to fantastic thanks to the service. 
 
Our party (7 total) had just come from two long days of off site meetings, so we were definitely ready to sit back and relax. Ericka - our waitress - got our night started right with a few happy hour specials. She had us laughing from the get go and was on top of her game all night. 

I started with the small chopped salad. I should have just gone with the large one for my meal. I love the chopped salad from Maggiano's and order it every time I'm there. For my main, I went with the Gnocchi with Italian Sausage. Huge portion of pasta that I took close to half home. Gorgeous space. Had a great time and would definitely recommend this to any office groups looking for a place that can cater to a large party."}
{"text":"We attended the children's cooking class today led by Chef Antonio. The class was organized very well and the atmosphere was relaxing and enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was delicious and there was plenty of food. I will definitely be back to try your food. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I haven't even finished eating.  This place is amazing.  The manager came over and treated us to this amazing bruschetta sample, just because he overheard it was our first time here.
Everyone here is incredibly nice, welcoming, and honestly I truly believe it's because that is who they genuinely are - unlike many places where the thin veil of customer service is apparent.  Everyone here seems like they have that bond you only see with close family.
Wait.  I have to finish this review after we get our food.  Brunch for us: Italian sausage Frittata and Braised Beef Hash and Eggs.
Wow.  Just wow.  I am a man of ketchup on my potatoes and I never NOT put ketchup on potatoes.  Almost never.  The potatoes, crusted with I assume Parmesan and light salt were the best I've ever had.  And I would know, I'm Irish.  But let's talk about the frittata.  Can we talk about the frittata?  It was the best I've ever had. The Italian sausage completes me.  The spinach in every bite, smoked mozzarella (which this place is so authentic I bet the pronounce it \"mootzurelle\") on top.  I will make sure I am a regular here.  Amazing.  Just outstanding.
Thank you Maggiano's for gracing is with your existence."}
{"text":"The rave reviews surprise me.  Saltiest food ever.  I could barely eat the eggplant parm, which is usually a favorite of mine.  I was thirsty for an entire day after...I thought I was going to need an IV to replenish my fluids!"}
{"text":"Well, we come here a couple of times a year when we are in Vegas. Tonight we had an excellent server, Frank. He's a tall \"New Yawk\" boy.

We had several requests throughout the meal, which were all attended to promptly, and with a genuine smile. We really enjoyed the excellent service and sunny disposition."}
{"text":"The service here is awful. It took us an hour to be sat. We never it bread, it felt like a very uncaring environment. The food might be good but I am not sure because it is taking so long to get served that I might die of starvation first. I have been waiting so long that I have time to write all this. Also stingy with the bread and balsamic."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!  Celebrating our anniversary and the staff brought out a card for us, also had someone come out and give my wife options because she's a vegetarian. Sitting outside and the waiter is the best. I cannot say how good this place is."}
{"text":"Thanks Jackie & staff for our business banquet. Great food, service, bartender, private room. Best way to host an event and pre-arrange \"family style\". Pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Much much better than I would have guessed it would be for a chain restaurant (I'm a bit of a snob).

Food was excellent, service was good, and the take home portions are a bonus!"}
{"text":"Previous experiences led me to believe my meal tonight would be quite good. I was wrong- food was mediocre, not bad, just very average and more on par with the quality of frozen entrees in a supermarket. From years ago expectedly the Maggiano's special salad to be that- but it wasn't. Again, not bad, but not worth the price. It was one of the things I was actually looking forward to having there. 
Meals were lasagna and light chicken Alfredo. The former was average while the latter bland with overcooked pasta. No real reason to return. Obviously others don't feel that way, but standards are different I suppose."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!!  I never have a bad meal here. The staff is very attentive and accommodating. They even have the special where you being home a classic pasta when you order a classic pasta. My fiancé and I travelled home to CA with pasta and gnocchi. How could you beat that?!?!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I was craving pasta and me and my friends decided to try maggianos for the first time last monday  and it did not disappointed I had fettuccine Alfredo, it was really  really good, and the service? amazing!! Antonio took great care of us he was super attentive and friendly next time we go again we will definitely request him, this location is inside the fashion show mall so it was very convenient for my group to do some shopping therapy after a great dinner, I can't wait to go again, the bread was soooo good, the pasta was the best in vegas and Antonio made our experience one we won't forget. Thank you maggianos"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in town please stay far far away from all of garden which is just overpriced Italian food man I can't stand all of garden and how I love MAGGIANO'S. I started off with the appetizer it was delightful refreshing fluffy. Then I moved on to the main course of rigatoni The noodles were cooked perfectly sauce was perfection in my mouth. And I finished with the nice refreshing strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Could be a bit pricey for what you get at this restaurant. I ordered the lobster ravioli (which literally gives you like 8 pieces or something), and it was very good. 

I love pasta, and this place seems to cook it well. The bread isn't that bad here either. Great service too!

I have been to the one in Santa Row in CA, and I feel that the vibe there is more elegant than this one (since this one is in the Fashion Mall). Bring your family here..."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Large portions of food.  The service in the bar area is not so great.  The prices are decent."}
{"text":"I lived on Maggianos in college and the food has always been amazing.i had my wedding reception in the ballroom upstairs on Saturday and it was amazing. The food was wonderful as well as the drinks and the service was awesome. I did all of my planning all the way from California and they made it easy for me to have everything done and ready so that I did not have to worry. I worked with Shari and she was very helpful. What a beautiful event. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have to tread lightlly here as I see several highly favorable reviews for good ol' Maggianos.  I won't be as abruptly rude as I would like to be ;)....

I honestly don't see the hype!!!  I am not a fan.  I was forced against my will to dine at Maggianos and it was only my 3rd time going here and it will hopefully be my last.  

I mean, I don't know how else to say it:  It just isn't that good!  I am not a fan of big chains in the first place and I've already stated that I am an Italian food snob so I understand that my opinion my mean nothing but so what...

Here was my experience in a nutshell:

Reservations, 1:00, rude hostess, finally sat around 1:30.
Bread on tables?  Bleh, not fresh, not good.
The food..I ordered Eggplant Parm, which came with a side of pasta/marinara sauce.  Puke and pukity.  Soggy breaded eggplant wich I couldn't even tell there was eggplant hidden in the mush and super salty marinara sauce that tasted like Preggo.

I will say that those who ordered Chicken Francaise were extremely impressed.  Those of us that ordered pasta dishes, not so much.  

The service-Just okay...had to ask for refills on water a few times and we all sat patiently waiting to order the desserts we picked out well before dinner all to have our checks brought with no option to order dessert!  LOL...I guess they wanted us OUT!  I don't blame them.  We were annoying.  There was like 13 of us after a baby dedication so we were taking pictures, passing around a baby, laughing too loud, etc.  

On ANOTHER note, I found it interesting that at the end of your meal they bring you a another free meal if you ordered one of their signature pastas.  I am sure the average person would be screaming \"score!!!\" but the foodie/skeptic in me was screaming \"wth?\"  Like, what?  Are you cleaning out your fridge and want to give me all the leftovers or did you cook too much lasagna so you are sending me home with some?  I don't get it.  Normally I would take free food but if the quality was where it should be and it was fresh/homemade, etc.. Sorry to burst any bubbles but you wouldn't be getting a free meal.  Just my opinion.

There are way better Italian restaurants out there and even better chains.  I think Carrabas is a better Italian chain."}
{"text":"I Love, love maggianos food and I don't care that it's a chain etc. We usually go here 2-3 times a year. The reason for the number of times being so low is because I live in Gilbert, that is about a 35-40 minute drive each way. The food was great this time as always (I have never had an issue with the food) however on this particular night, 5/30/15 they were doing a charity for a great cause \"make a wish\" foundation. I am all for charity and doing anything to help out, however when i go out to eat I still expect great service no matter the situation. We had to flag down our waiter several times, remind him to bring what we had asked for, and my daughter got a kids meal and we orderd a drink with it, that took 20 minutes to come out. He then came to our table and apologized and said the reason he wasn't attending to us like he usually does is because they are doing the event for charity 
etc etc. So in other words you are telling me that our business or us as customers are not that important to you. It was not just
our waiter but the whole staff seemed to be off their game that night. I witnessed 3 glasses being broken in a matter of an hour 
one of incidents happened to be a class breaking from the 2nd floor and landing on a couple who was eating dinner at the table below. 
I would like to make a suggestion, if ever you have a large party that needs special attending to, maybe only 2 of your waiters and 
or manager should be servicing that table. Do not have your staff juggle that and on top of that all their other tables as well. 
The service was just really horrible on this particular night. On top of not getting attended to like we normally do at Maggiano's, 
we had an issue with the bill, (that one wasn't really a big deal, it was corrected, however could of been prevented if we 
didn't have different servers coming to our table. We also made a reservation for 615pm, it Was a Saturday night and it is 
always packed here, even with a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes and we were only a party of 3. I was really disappointed 
in this night, I don't know when I will be returning again, I just hope that my favorite Italian restaurant doesn't end up 
being this place that I used to go to that used to be really great."}
{"text":"Made reservation just to be safe. Got here early and was seated right away. Great ambiance. Not to dim not to bright. Waiter seemed a bit rushed but on point with drinks and food suggestions."}
{"text":"i ordered the shrimp alfredo.... tell me why it was 5 little pieces of shrimp on my big plate and the sauce was okay but it wasn't flavorful"}
{"text":"After extremely abusive service at Maggiano's tonight, I'm calling it quits. The food was burned and the server was so rude that we didn't feel comfortable with the scene that we thought complaining would have caused. It went sort of comical at first, but the longer the service continued for, the more abusive it got until it was downright hostile at the end.

It all started with drinks we ordered at the bar; the hostesses told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, so we ordered there. Our table was ready in 10, so we settled up at the bar (the bartender was incredibly nice, btw) and took he drinks to our seat. The waitress was clearly agitated that we already had drinks and said she didn't bring us bread because we might have just gotten that at the bar too (you only get bread with dinner, so that was a very clear dig). My girlfriend said \"are we being punished for having drinks already?\" when the waitress left the table, and it was obvious we were. 

 She paid attention to the table's around us and didn't even make eye contact with us. She finally asked about the food hallways through our meal by saying \"it's good, right\" while looking at the plate of burned cannelloni that was sitting mostly uneaten (I'm posting pictures). When a server asked a question like that as brusquely as she did, she sin't looking for the truth, so I kept my mouth closed while my girlfriend said her dinner was fine. She asked us if we wanted desert or more drinks and when we said no, she plopped down our dirty plates back down at the edge of the table and stormed off to get our check. She dropped it at the table and that was the last we saw of her.

 We talked it over while trying to make change between the two of us and left her a 10% tip. I don't believe in less than 15% typically (we left the bartender 30%), but she was so rude I think that I should have left nothing.

  I used to take people here all the time (and it was recommended in my Las Vegas list) because the atmosphere was nice, the view is great and the food was reliable. Lately, none of that has been true and I'm done trying to weather out a bad time at Maggiano's. I've been to this location 5 times in the last year (I'm the duke of checkins here on Yelp), but tonight will probably be the last. Disinterested service I can overlook and even incapable service is something I'll suffer through for decent food or the right occasion. I've learned my lesson tonight though; there are too many better places that are only a stones throw away."}
{"text":"My friends & I had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at Maggiano's as the lunch reception for their 10-year wedding vow renewal. We had 3 tables that seated about 10-12 people. There was plenty of room for a display table as well. And there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip & Encore. They had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room (we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived & they corrected it before the families arrived). Overall the service and the experience was a positive one. I think it's safe to say the guests & celebrants enjoyed their time at Maggiano's. I'd advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant. My friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information. So convenient...

Now on to the menu: First course was stuffed mushrooms, calamari & italian salad. The stuffed mushrooms were good. They were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs. They were served in a white wine sauce. You cant go wrong with calamari and their version didn't disappoint. Fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping. Just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and you're golden. The italian salad was surprisingly delicious. Salad had arugula, lettuce, pepperoncinis & croutons in italian dressing. Good appetizers. I enjoyed every single one of them. 

Second course consisted of meat lasagna, rustic chicken & shrimp and chicken marsala. I loved the meat lasagna. But really, what's not to love? It's lasagna! And it was classically delicious. They don't call it \"Mom's meat lasagna with meat sauce\" for nothing. Crumbled meatballs & sausage with ricotta cheese. Boom! I didnt have the rustic chicken & shrimp but my friend's seemed to like it. The chicken marsala was so very good. White meat chicken that was so moist and tasty. It was the perfect chicken dish. I loved it the most... And that's saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu. Order it. Trust me.

For dessert, we had 2 offerings. Chocolate zucotto cake & Nonna's toasted pound cake. All I had was the toasted pound cake & that's all I needed. It was so damn good. Crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas. Game over. I dont have to tell you how good it was. You already know. 

You're welcome..."}
{"text":"I had really, really high expectations at this restaurant. Too bad many weren't met. Decor was nice. Service wasn't awful, but I could tell the hostess and our server wasn't giving it all of his all. The bread is delicious though! I ordered the Clam Linguine w/ white wine sauce and my friend ordered the Chicken Marsala. I really didn't like my clam linguine that much. The way it was described on the menu wasn't what I saw in front of me. Had shells and them clam mixed into the pasta. There was also a lot of wine sauce and oils that I wish they drained before placing in my bowl. It just wasn't seasoned to my taste and I feels as if the ingredients they use should be tweaked. My friend's Chicken Marsala was also sub par. Once again plating was an issue... Her chicken and mushrooms were on a plate and her pasta was in a small bowl. It was just odd since she basically had to put it together herself. We've been to other nice restaurants where the server would do it for us or either ask us if we wanted it separated. When we got our ticket, I told the server that I had a $10 off $30 coupon (main reason for visiting) and It took him 3 times to get the check right. I'm glad I can say I've been here but we should've walked over to the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is really good across the Nation, service is always spot on and the high quality of food is consistent.

My favorite fried calamari is from Maggiano's.  The specific location in Scottsdale is perfect for large parties and they are very accommodating and friendly.  

We took mom there for Mother's Day for a buffet special for Mom's and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Loved this place last Saturday night but valet parking was full so I went across the street at WYNNS VALET PARKING and walked across the street. Food and bar was wonderful.... If you order classics you get to take home another meal, like OLIVE GARDEN not advertised..... Definitely will be back....."}
{"text":"I thought it couldn't get any better, I was wrong. Atlanta could use some training tips from Scottsdale, wow! We get so use to the mundane that we forget what the flavor of good food, great service and beautiful atmosphere can do for your soul. The exquisite flavors wake up your taste buds and remind you of fabulous moments. The professional service reminds you of what life should be like. The atmosphere carries you away to another time. Value the experience, be in the moment, let your senses sour. Do not buy the crab cakes. They changed the recipe and unfortunately they don't measure up. Certainly not worth the outrageous price."}
{"text":"Large portion meals. Decent Italian food. It was my boyfriend's and I first date place. Returned for our anniversary also. Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on  Sunday night just as a walk in had forgotten the reviews recommended to make reservations. Place was packed, waiting time was 45 minutes for a table of two. Waited at the bar had the best red sangria I've ever had. Also ordered the calamari, was not rubbery it was lightly crispy! So delicious. Bread they gave was too hard. Service was Excellent. 
Finally got a table service was fast & friendly. The food was delicious too we got the spaghetti & meatball and seafood plate a little spicy and so buttery. Overall the entire experience was Excellent. 
Come prepared to wait this place is booming!!"}
{"text":"Came back to Maggiano's for what my friend and I call \"Wine Wednesday!\" We used to have this event (of 2 people, haha) every week but as we all know people get busy. I find it a great place for happy hour wine and appetizers. They have added some new items to the menu from when we used to go, but that's great! 

I had last my voice the previous weekend so the bartenders were having a good time with me while I waited for my friends. They are very friendly guys and very attentive. I got there about 445pm and found seating at the bar right away. Once my friends did get there I ordered the Merlot and the bartenders were on top of it! 

For food I ordered the bruschetta and crab cakes, soooo yummy! I think I could continually eat the crab cakes. Just keep them coming! Overall, my experience here is always great. The food always comes out perfect and great service. I have yet to come and eat for dinner, whats holding me back? Oh yah I live in the NW and this place is easy to come to after work. One day I will though!"}
{"text":"Maggiano's gave us an excellent wedding reception! We had about 70 people at Maggiano's after our wedding at Caesar's palace.

I wholeheartedly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner with a group of 13 people. Our waiter and staff were excellent! We ordered family style and every item we ordered was delicious! We even had a complimentary bruschetta brought to us by the chef  my favorite drink there is the French martini  definitely recommended this restaurant especially when you have a large group. Thank Maggianos for a great dinner and the staff for being so fabulous!"}
{"text":"We have been to Maggianos on the strip many times but tried this location tonight at 8:30pm not busy and sat for 15 min before someone came up and asked if we had been helped yet when we said no he took our order and we again waited 15 min to get our drinks and bread never being checked on again til dinner came had to ask for water and waited another 10 min for water. Very disappointed in the service tho the guys who helped us was nice just no reason for us to wait so long at all! Not sure Id come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Called in for a birthday for my twins 18th and asked for a window and called back day of and asked again for a good view we were stuck in the bar in a loud area very noisy no view and the food was cold the chicken was over cooked and they did nothing special for my twins bday no birthday wish or surprise! Wont be back food menu changed and not the same quality as it was a year ago! Very disPointed!"}

The food was fantastic,  we took our friends from New York City, NY last saturday .. and they loved it.  that was the real test. They were surprised at the name..  Hey is this like Il Tormina in Little Italy or what ?  GREAT FOOD !   Everything but the Tony Bennett pictures on the wall. (for those that know, they know what I mean)  We sat outside on a cool lovely evening.  What really blew us away was getting an entire pasta dish to take home and eat the next day.  huge portion.. We will definitely be back soon.   Great wine list too.   this place is huge.."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiances family  and this place was amazing. They are Sicilian, so you can only imagine how important real Italian food is to them. We had a party of 12, and they treated us so nicely .
Anyway, the bathroom, has the BEST napkins I have ever dried my hands with! I know weird right, and apparently the men's has some pretty cool artwork above the urinals ( according to my fiance' ).
 The food is amazing, hot, yummy. Some of the family  had the raviolis, lasagna, sausage appetizer, salads, the shrimp linguine; all was superb. Will be going again when in Vegas. Like prior comments it is a chain restaurant but run like an original!
Thanks again for the lovely time!"}

The service here is ALWAYS amazing (I go often.) It doesn't matter what you get, you will enjoy it. I recommend the Raviolis and their house salad (yuuum!) 

There's a little \"secret\" that isn't such a secret anymore.. After you are seated, ask for the \"Family Style\" menu. They'll bring you a totally different menu with great prices and it's all \"family style.\" They'll keep bringing you more and more of what you want until you ask to stop :) And I have tried everything on this menu and it's all delicious. I think the minimum you need to get family style is only three people. It is well worth it, I promise.

You gotta try this place! I promise you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"After a long hard day of shopping, I wandered upstairs to a restaurant called Maggiano's.  I am so happy I did!  The restaurant itself sounded familiar but I knew I had never dined there before.  

Our server Daniel was very attentive and personable, it was my first visit to Las Vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time.  This restaurant had a great view.  You could see Las Vegas Blvd, people shopping, or other diners just like me.  Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at Maggiano's and we were definitely enjoying ourselves!

We started our dining experience with the Bruschetta.  It was definitely some of the best bruschetta I have ever had.  I make a pretty killer bruschetta and I was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta.  Splendido!!  The bruschetta was served on Italian Garlic Bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and roasted garlic.

We also ordered: the Chopped Salad, the Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup, and the Fettuccine Alfredo.  The Chopped Salad was very good.  I ordered it without green onions.  The salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado, and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing.  Most of the items on the menu, they give you the option to order half or the full portion.  Believe me when I say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing.  I ordered the whole chopped salad and it was really big.  The Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup contained italian sausage, fennel, white beans and tomatoes.  It was really tasty.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce.  We only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large.

Overall my experience at Maggiano's was great from start to finish.  Our waters were never left empty, and our server was always around if we needed anything.  It seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldn't ask the server for.

If you around the Fashion Show Mall and you spot Maggiano's on the 2nd floor, you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because I assure you it will be worth it.  I will definitely wander back into a Maggiano's even if its not in Las Vegas.

Cheers and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service. Had a wonderful birthday dinner with my friend. Ordered the bruchetta, green salad, chicken Marsala and spaghetti with Italian sausage. Love the bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Every bite was delicious and our sever Nicole is a sweetheart. I will come here again. Posted some pics."}
{"text":"The worst experience with this restaurant chain ever, management was not working with the host. A patron waiting behind me was attacking me on making a decision on whether I wanted to wait 90 mins to eat after the host asked me if I wanted to wait 15 seconds earlier. I came to Scottsdale to relax on vacation and left knowing people are so rude in this city."}
{"text":"The food here is not up to the standard set by the chain.  The servers are nice and some of them are up to the standard.  The patio is always closed on some flimsy excuse or other.

The most infuriating case was when they arbitrarily closed it a few minutes before we arrived.  This was at least an hour before they closed and it was something like 90 degrees outside.

This issue had so enraged me as to put me off the whole chain in every city."}
{"text":"We love the Marco's Meal for Two!  Tons of food.  The Fried Zucchini app is sooooo scrumptious!  Really!  Sounds old school-but nice planks of zukes coated in crispy breadcrumbs and fried to perfection.  We always get Mama's Lasagna and the 4 Cheese Pesto Ravioli-and the same to take home for another dinner.  Cheesecake is my fave!  You can't beat the price-and you certainly NEVER go away hungry.  Great Customer Service and a fun, family friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I was treated to dinner by our kids here at Maggiano's in Fashion Show Mall and the dinner was great. Everyone had something different and all the dishes were great. My husband who is also a chef had no complaints, which is very rare, he had Clams & Linguine, the sauce was surely a hit with everyone at the table ( we all sampled each others dishes lol), I had the Chicken Francese, the chicken was tender and juicy, loved the butter sauce and the crispy Potatoes. The kids ate Lasagna and Chicken Parmesan both equally good! Our appetizer was the Mozzarella & Marinara very good sauce. The lack of a fifth star was not because of food but the wait we had even with our reservation. But with good food you must expect a crowd and the wait was worth it. We also had a table with a great view of the Las Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Maggianos is a go-to for both work parties and colleague get-togethers. I love the food, and the portions are good enough to take some home rather than eating it all (which is nice, because of the price of some of these dishes...ahem). 

However, I am noticing a trend at this Maggianos - one that involves a lack of customer engagement and also a lack of respect for customers in general. A specific waiter, who I have had on several occasions, continuously causes friction at tables. This includes treating customers with less respect and also speaking ill of customers to other waitstaff (I have personally witnessed this very thing). This particular waiter is so awful I aways request being seated in a different section now rather than having to put up with him and his antics.

So, while I like Maggianos, I caution those who dine there. While the food is 4 stars, the customer service is meh."}
{"text":"Liked a lot of things about this restaurant, the chef came personally to make sure that he does not add any allergic elements in my food. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because their special Rigatoni \"D\"'s chicken felt like chewing gum. It was like having to put effort to eat it!! But it's just one dish, I believe plenty of people will have good experience with this place."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place from various people. Armed with a gift card, Brian P. And I decided to check this place out for a lunch date today (2/3/15.)

Okay so I'm not the biggest pasta fan in the universe, and the calorie counts here are insanity. I figured 800-1700 calorie meals must equate to a restaurant that serves huge portions. After eating here, I guess not.

We waited outside because we had an 11 am reservation. 2 minutes to 11, staff, including back of house, were sitting at tables right in front of the doors, on their phones drinking stuff. Not a good look.

We entered through the mall entrance. Staff at the bar just looked at us but didn't point us to the podium in the center of the restaurant or acknowledge us. 

We sat at a booth while a boisterous waiter told us about the specials. He talked up a bacon bruschetta ($13.95) and a spare rib dish ($19.95) - both of which we ordered. Brian ordered the steak ($17.95) as his entree.

Above us must have been some waiter stand because two male waiters were complaining to each other about who was scheduled for the night shift vs day and how it was unfair, blah, blah, blah. Take that ish to the back, not right where customers are forced to listen.

Bacon bruschetta was not that great. 5 pieces of crostini topped with a tablespoon of ricotta, a slice of bacon, a single arugala leaf and some balsamic drizzle. That comes out to... $2.79/piece pre tax. It wasn't that tasty and definitely did not deserve a waiter waxing poetic about it. Would not order even if it were $2.79 for all 5 pieces. 

Pork spare rib dish was quite small and not filling. Amount did not justify the price. Polenta was fried like tater tots rather than creamy like I was hoping.

Brian's steak was ordered medium but was easily well to well done. He was visibly unhappy about his meal. Presentation was sloppy as his meat was swimming in sauce. 

Despite an empty restaurant, a crochety, demanding couple was seated next to us. They needed lemons, they needed balsamic, they needed minced garlic, they needed the garlic to be fresh and then fried in the back, they needed the garlic crispier... This was before they even ordered and all this was just to eat the complimentary bread. Then they needed the specials read and then they couldn't decide so they needed verbal descriptions of a handful of the waiter's favorite dishes. It was all I could do to not make a comment to them.

Overall while the restaurant looks nice and our waiter did a fine job, the rest of the experience was lackluster and the food was disappointing and a poor value at $55 total. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love love this restaurant!! They have romantic setting, looks like a candle light feel. They also have a man come around and sing to you, my husband and I do love all of their pasta dishes and they do accommodate to any of your dietary needs"}
{"text":"We went here because we got a gift card for Xmas, I thought it was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary bread was great and then we had a chicken flatbread that was good the waitress was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar gift card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two drinks and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a gift card."}
{"text":"This is One Of my Favorite To Go Restaurants when I have family in Town, I made a reservation for my mothers birthday dinner at 730, Don't bother making reservations you won't get seated, you'll have to wait 40-45 min like everybody else that just walks in!checked in and was told they would text us when our table is ready! We got seated at 810. Not to mention when we got seated their was plenty of empty tables around us....Our waitress was very nice & helpful. We took half of our food home, 2 hours later everyone was SICK! LAST time i take family & friends here!"}
{"text":"Hostess was completely rude about my lace dress, I understand policies, but there is much nicer ways to saying my lace dress want appropriate. No apologies were offered and she completely tried to embarrass me. I'm sure someone could've handled my situation way better than she did. I love coming here but until this hostess is gone I will not be coming back ever."}
{"text":"I'm the type of gal who orders a cheeseburger and fries at a Mexican food joint. Or fried chicken at a steak house. Or rolled tacos at a chicken pie shop. And usually with decent results. Go figure. 

This time around, I made no exception & ordered calamari and jumbo lump crab cakes at a an Italian restaurant. (I did have a side of fettucine alfredo though.) Having said that, I'm happy to report that these crab cakes were in fact some of the best I've had. Ever. Moist, tender, flavorful crab mixed with the perfect blend of spices and cooked to perfection. They were accompanied by a ridiculous pile of yummy onion strings that were a nice compliment. 

http://static2.px.yelp.com/photo/Oom3jxuiY_gq_lwTtVaq_Q/l 

The calamari was pretty good although in my ravenous state, those were gone before I remembered to whip out my camera. Boo. Hubs had an entree of pork medallions in a cream sauce that I had a bite or two of. Goody good good. His side of spaghetti marinara was just okay though. 

http://static2.px.yelp.com/photo/Fr6nMhzpaaicLsx_ZBczgg/l

Service was a bit lacking unfortunately. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink aside from water and didn't really tend to us until the end of our meal. So I had to take away a star for that. Aside from that, I'll definitely return for the food and food alone.

Mangia!"}
{"text":"I just want to first say that I'm incredibly impressed with the service here, customer service is hard to come by these days. The food was amazing it came out very quick and we were given a complimentary appetizer for being first time customers!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Eddie was wonderful!! Food was great as the service. I'll be back very soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We met up with a group of friends at Maggiano's on a Friday evening for one of their birthdays. Due to the size of our party, we ordered family style. This works out better for appetites such as mine, as I can usually help devour whatever is left over.

We went with the larger set-up of family style meals, which looked to be a good deal. As we awaited our appetizers and salads, an older gentleman stopped by the table with his acoustic guitar to sing some songs, he played three (including happy birthday) and wished our friend another happy birthday before he went to another table. And proceeded to play the same three songs (but with more gusto for them); and to the next table, you guessed it... same three songs. 

The appetizers came out, we opted for the fried mozzarella and zucchini. The mozz was great! Wish there was a little more sauce on the plates or some ranch. The fried zucchini came with what looked like ranch, so it all worked out. Nope, that is a lemon sauce that masquerades as ranch. When asked for a side of ranch, we were rebuffed with a, \"We don't carry ranch here.\" OK then.

Our main courses began to roll out, this time our table became filled with lasagna, ravioli, alfredo and a go-to Italian dish: chicken parmagiana.

Where to begin? The lasagna had a very pre-made/frozen taste to it, however, Stouffer's tastes more authentic than Maggiano's. Their iteration of chicken parm was ghastly. It seemed like it was cooked in a microwave with its rubbery, tough, dry and flavorless texture.

I did not partake in the ravioli or alfredo until the next day, which is where I messed up. Those two dishes were the best of the four we chose.

Desserts came out and they looked amazing. I, however, don't eat dessert, so I can only go off of the very little that was left to ascertain that it was pretty good.

Onto day 2... I awoke Saturday morning with some serious pain. A mixture of \"I ate too much and now I am starving\" and \"RUN\". After a few trips to eliminate the intestinal pain, I was feeling good again.

That evening, my wife re-heated the leftovers we were given according to the instructions on the to-go containers. Once more into the breach we went, devouring what was left. The ravioli and alfredo I skipped the night before were really tasty and I wished I had tried them the first night.

Sunday morning was a repeat of Saturday morning. Needless to say, I shan't be patronizing Maggiano's again. The service was pretty good, the ambiance was nice. As is usually an issue for restaurants, it was the food that will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is one few decent cheap eats in Las Vegas.  Located conveniently outside Fashion Show Mall, perfect place to grab lunch or dinner if you're at the North end of the strip.  There isn't a Maggiano's in the Bay Area, but this best resembles Romano's Macaroni Grill and/or Olive Garden.

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch before our flight home and ordered:
-Rigatoni D: chicken, mushrooms and rigatoni pasta [I forgot what sauce was used...since this was my boyfriend's plate and I didn't really eat off of it cuz my sandwich was so filling].
- Seared Salmon Sandwich: the sandwich included 1) seared salmon was so moist, 2) applewood bacon was so crispy, 3) avocado gave it the perfect ring to my sandwich (I LOVE avocados in my sandwich), 4) tomato, 5) lettuce.  The brioche bread was so fresh and soft!  Kettle chips was a bonus!

Bill wasn't too bad for 2 people considering how full we were.  More worth it than other places on the strip and our waiter was superrr nice & friendly!"}
{"text":"Very good service by Alex. He was almost a little pushy about his favorites on the menu and talked more than he should have listened. Nonetheless he was a nice young man. The meal, on the other hand, was terrible. I got a simple dish of quinoa pasta with a spicy sauce, spinach and allegedly some Swiss chard. Poorly plated, really just plopped  into the bowl. Sauce splattered the sides of the bowl to make it very unappealing, like someone had been eating the dish prior to it being torn away and delivered to me. Rather than spicy, the flavor was dominated, overpowered by salt. The pasta was done well, the veggies added were there, I guess. Couldn't really tell because of the salt. I had them hold the chicken, so I can't comment on an item which is normally included in the dish. There was maybe two cups, at most, to the dish. $20 for the quality and quantity is a joke, also."}
{"text":"We stopped in just for a quick drink after a horrible experience at The Pub and didn't eat, but the bartender was very sweet and the wine was a nice pour.  We have eaten here before and always enjoy the food.  If we didn't have other errands to run, we would have stayed for some of their house salad (so yum!) or sausage flatbread, which is surprisingly low calorie!"}
{"text":"One of my best Italian places. You really need a reservation unless you want to wait a while. Everything is as good as it gets, pricey butworth it. You will go home with leftovers."}
{"text":"I love Maggiano's in Chicago. This one was okay. We made a reservation for 12 and since it was a large group, you have to order family style, which was okay. The big thing was we had a reservation and we had to wait almost an hour more before we got seated. That would be okay, but we had elderly person with us. We had to go get a chair from the restrurant and sit outside while we waited, since the bar area was packed with people waiting too.

The manager did try to recover with offering us a free appetizer. The waitresses where good and the food was okay.

Overall, I would go somewhere else if you have a large party and do not want to wait even if you have a reservation for food that was okay."}
{"text":"I really hate to give anyone this bad of a rating but it is the truth.  I sat at the bar to have a drink while waiting for my friend and was greeted by a drone of a bartender who seemed annoyed that I wanted a drink.  REALLY??? While enjoying my cocktail, I noticed that every table in the bar had towers of dirty plates and glasses.  There was not a bus person or wait staff to be found cleaning.  A crowd of employees were hovered over a coworkers cell phone.  When my friend arrives we decide to move to a bar table that was clean.  The bartender wouldn't allow us to transfer our tab to a table 3 feet away.  We should have left after that but we were very hungry.  We finally order and as we were waiting a server dropped a tray full of wine glasses.  Glass shattered everywhere!  Under our table and on my lap. It was quickly cleaned 

My friend arrives to save me from the already poor experience.  He orders a drink from our personality deprived bartender.  We are not ever offered a menu or a napkin, basically ignored.  We decide to move to a finally cleared bar table in hopes of getting service.   WRONG!!!!  We sat for ten minutes with a waitress passing us several times.  I finally grab menus .  As we are looking over the menus a server drops a tray of wine glasses next to our table.  Glass landed on my lap and all around our table.  I understand it was an accident, but never received a slight concern by the five employees gathered around the mess.  Not even the manager!!!! The waitress finally makes her way over to our table and  and the first thing she says is do you have a tab at the bar because I will have to transfer it.  WOW!  Really??? We order apps, they come out cold.  Dinner was fair and at this point I'm over the experience.  We stay to chat a bit after dinner to get asked by the waitress if we were done because she needed to leave like 5 mins ago.  Living back in Ohio I loved to go to Maggiano's but this location needs to step it up!  I have had several clients share what poor management and subpar service.  Yelpers BEWARE!"}
{"text":"This is probably my FAVORITE thing about Vegas to date . (Moved here in August of 2015) . 
The Servers , for starters , were so unbelievable polite and knowledgeable about the menu . They offered FAVORITE dish suggestions and refilling the water glass was continuous without even having to ask . 

The greeters , they were fast and efficient . They were also polite and seemed as though they liked working at the location which made me more intrigued with the place. 

The dining experience , AMAZING!!! The setting is very much so like an old Italian restaurant . The ambiance of fresh bread and wine filled the air . I ordered a Frozen mixed Bellini . It was SUPERB!! 
For an appetizer I had the Mozzarella flats \"not sure what the technical menu name is \" but it's like a mozzarella stick it's just a flat square. 

The food portions , are very generous . I went with the Marcos meal. To my surprise , it comes with a  FREE take home pasta . 

One other thing that sealed my experience here was the manager ! There was a couple sitting near us and she had a few allergies and specifications on how she needs her food cooked . I was in awe at how much the manager knew about the food preparations and how completely polite and helpful she was throughout the whole 30 minute exchange. The couple even joked about \"adopting her\" because she was so sweet and polite . I can not WAIT to return !! 

Signed , 
Full of pasta and gratitude !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour - food was good (not remarkable, but yummy) however we were bowled over by the service.  Nicole waited on us and she was fantastic.  Really made our experience much nicer."}
{"text":"The food is flat out- excellent. We started with brushetta,  Italian salad and some bread. The brushetta is just fantastic and tasty! Our main entree was braised beef with sausage . The beef is soo tender , flavorful, and just simply delicious.. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs. They are great. All in all great experience."}
{"text":"Honestly I cannot Stand Olive Garden and this place is worse 1. Not even any freshly grated parm .. The food is mediore at best and the only thing Fine about this restaurant is that it is located in the area in which we live i.e. Summerlin.. The food is better or just as good at Olive Garden tbh. GL And  I do not like Servers telling me about their late nights and what not. I am not there to dine to listen to regaled tales of your fkd up night. Keep it professional."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but I just can't.  
There was absolutely nothing that I liked.

The waitress was rude and not very smart.  The food was not very good.  I had the lasagna, and I didn't even want to have more than a few bites before I said I was done with it.  I could make better lasagna at home.

We came for a birthday party and they brought out the cake, but didn't bring forks for about 5-10 minutes later.

I have no desire to return here."}
{"text":"Made reservations for Easter...it was crowded but great service and food. What I appreciated was the choices for meals..family style or the normal dinner menu....and no price gouging because it is a holiday. Cannot say enough good things... cheers to the management and the servers for working so hard and accommodating everyone on this VERY busy day at the restaurant. Highly recommend Richard as a server...excellent service and great person overall. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"I don't know why this doesn't have a lower review. 

The service here was okay, our server was nice, but as with most restaurants on the strip...when we have declined drinks it seems as though the service declines along with that. 

The reason for the low review, however, is because the food is just not good. I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo and I make better alfredo sauce at home, and can buy better alfredo sauce in a jar, off the self, at my local grocery store. My husband ordered the mushroom ravioli, and he loves mushrooms and I hate them, so he rarely gets to eat them, and he still hated this meal. The alfredo is thin, and tastes very salty. There is no body of flavor in this sauce, I cannot taste any garlic or cheese for that matter. Just really lacking. 

The one thing I did really like about this restaurant is that they have make a wish stars on each table. Beyond that, I really was not impressed."}
{"text":"Is is by far the best Italian food I've had in Vegas!! Actually probably the best I've ever had! I would totally recommend sitting outside as the view of the strip is amazing and makes for some great people watching! And the cheese ravioli was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Maggiano's for a private event with breakfast service.  I must say, the food was delicious.  The eggs looked undercooked, but they sure were tasty!  I had a few helpings there.  Don't just a book by its cover!  The private room was suitable for our event and service was on point.  True to Italian flare, I believe I heard a little Frank Sinatra in the background during a quiet moment.  As we exited the restaurant shortly after 11 AM, the restaurant area was beginning to fill for lunch.  I look forward to visiting for lunch or dinner at another time."}
{"text":"We chose Maggionos to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed.  We got a printed Tha nk you for choosing M's! Tsylor was our astute server telling everything we should know about the offerings of our choice. The salmon oscae wasrrally fab. I had a drink in a copper mug made with ginger beer. The spaghetti was also very good. Stephanie was a wonderful hostess. I'm glad there is you. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Very good place, used to go to the one in the fashion show mall. This is a lot closer. The Lasagna is my favorite"}
{"text":"Italian fare served up in an old school atmosphere.  The menu includes a vast number of appetizers, soups, salads, wonderful entrees and desserts to die for.  Portions are very large! Their lunch special includes a second entree of equal value to take home for later at no extra charge.  I believe you will find the food tasty and an excellent value.  The staff is very professional and friendly.  Conveniently located at SouthPark Mall so you can walk off those extra calories while you shop!"}
{"text":"I found them using the TripAdvisor application on my phone and the cool part was that I made a reservation thru the application!   I made the reservation for 6:30pm on a Friday and I drove 15 minutes.   I literally walked in and sat down.  Bypassed a line and they were packed.  I love this application! 

WHERE TO PARK:  There is complimentary valet parking at Forever 21 on Fashion Show drive.  There is an elevator that takes you to the back of the restaurant. 

Located above the Las Vegas Strip it has a great view and ambiance. 

I ordered a bowl of Creamy Tomato Basil Soup which was devine.  The bread complimented the meal but I was disappointed I wasn't offered Italian dipping sauce (Italian butter by a different name).  I love olive oil, vinegar and spices to dip my bread in.

I had a large Grilled Chicken Caprese salad as my entree and asked to substitute spinach for the mixed greens.   Off the menu:  Fresh Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Cucumbers,Kalamata Olives, Red Onions, Garlic Croutons & White Balsamic Vinaigrette. 
I like that the cucumbers and chicken were diced up, perfect mouthfuls.   I could barely taste the mozzarella cheese even though they were large bites.  I would recommend a stronger cheese that can overcome the dressing and stand out on its own.  The olives were pitted and I really appreciate that.  
I topped off the meal with a hot Cappuccino.
My waiter, Rafael E.,  was very attentive,  pleasant and visited me often.  My water glass was never empty and there were no broken dishes."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Maggiano's @ the Grove in L.A., but I also visit this location when my parents go shopping at the Fashion Show Mall.  Good service.  I always go with my usual, Rigatoni D."}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive server and a corner table with a great view of the strip made for a great bday dinner. Ok and my family being there made for a great dinner too. We ordered family style. The only thing I could suggest is to be more attentive to see if we wanted more of a certain dish though that is probably a business decision rather than the waiters. Everything tasted good and we all wanted more of from the starters to the deserts."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is well umm I guess just another chain restaurant in the Brinker International group alongside Chili's. The food here always tastes good though and it's way more nice than a Chili's (trust me...I used to work at a Chili's T_T). I really enjoyed the violinist that walked around the room playing guests favorite song. I share the shrimp scampi and it was okay. Nothing too stunning or extraordinary in my senses.

Good service, clean tables, tidy restrooms and prompt service."}
{"text":"Decent but not fantastic Italian food. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Maggiano's, but it does the trick when you been shopping all afternoon at South Park."}
{"text":"Everything that's great about a traditional Italian restaurant. Red checkered tablecloths, welcoming staff, baskets of warm bead with olive oil for dipping, and a menu filled with favorites. Even lighter-side options for delicious standards. Specials included a gluten free ravioli with fresh vegetable sauce that got rave reviews. As did the salmon salad.  Chicken Parmesan, chicken piccata, a rigatoni also were winners. Our small group Got lots of positive attention at lunch, since the place wasn't too busy mid-day, mid-week.  Fun for a celebratory family meal."}
{"text":"We were seated pretty fast for a Saturday night (we only had to wait about 20 minutes or so. The food was really good! My sister had the lasagna and said it was one of the best she has ever had. I had the fettuccine Alfredo, which tastes the same wherever you go...my mom ordered the shrimp scampi, the only reason I gave this place a 4 star is because they brought my moms dish out about 15 minutes after they brought out everyone else's dishes. She said the shrimp was over cooked and she was disappointed. I think they forgot her dish and rushed to prepare it. The mojito's were amazingly good!! They has a great deal. You buy a pasta dish for $14.95 and you get one to take home. We didn't take advantage of that because we were visiting out of town and staying in a hotel. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch, and waited to sit at one of the tables at the bar area. The female that was waiting tables during the 2:00pm shift had a horrible attitude and refused to clean the table off that we were going sit at. This place received 3 stars because Richard our waiter did a great job, making up for the poor service in the beginning."}
{"text":"Great service, consistent great food.  Maggiano's is never a disappointment. If you love a fish that is no longer on the menu, they will still make it for you. Such as the linguine with pesto, pine nuts, and grilled shrimp.  Yum."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The lasagna is very good and the drinks are made well which taste great. Be prepared to stay awhile and enjoy the total experience. They serve traditional menu and family style options."}
{"text":"As expected EXCELLENCE in front and service by Stephanie. Very similar service as in Costa Mesa. 
Mama, ask for the \"Today and Tomorrow Treat\" but we did not. It was already included with our MARCO'S MENU special for $40 for two, appetizer, lasagna, Tiramisu and two pasta meals for tomorrow!
What a GREAT DEAL.

Gracie Marco - Arrivederci Stefania"}
{"text":"Service was iffy. We dd the \"light family\" buffet, which included 2 appetizers, 2 salad, 2 pasta choices and lemon cookies. We ordered the calamari with warm mainara sauce and stuffed mushrooms. For the salad we ordered the Cesar and Chopped (bacon pieces, nano bits of avocado, tomato, and greens). As for the pastas, we ordered chicken linguini and another one, which I forgot. Initially the purpose of doing the family style buffet was to get the unlimited refills, but our waiter was quite stingy with it. 

Hmm, overall verdict?? After going on a strict heavy pasta diet, I wasn't really a big fan of this heavy strict pasta meal. Maybe one day I'll give it another shot and the ratings will be better."}
{"text":"Tried the Saltimbicca chicken and it was like nothing I have ever tasted. The dish was full of flavor (sage and other herbs) tender (perhaps pounded?) in a perfect mix of sauce. Wow! I normally go with the tenderloin medallions but glad that I ventured from the beef route. Oh, and the bread--addictive, so delicious."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my parents anniversary.  Had a group of 7 but no reservations.  Was seated in about 20 minutes and the service and food was fantastic.  Shout out to our waitress Nicole who was phenomenal."}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is the broschetta tour. I also like taking home an extra meal."}
{"text":"What I didn't like about it the most is the darkness. I understand dimmed light but it's too dark in there, almost too dark to read the fine print on the menu.
The food is OK, nothing special. They have a pretty good pasta deal where you get one order to eat and another to go for $12.95.
Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way dining there again."}
{"text":"*MEN looking to take your gf or soon to be gf or wife on a NICE CHEAP DATE? Maggiano's is the place to go ;)

MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT! I come here about at least twice a month and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food. Make sure you try their Caesar's salad because they honestly have the BEST Caesar's salad. Everything else I've had on their menu has been phenomenal. 

At Maggiano's you're able to substitute or subtract/add items you don't like. They also serve bread so an appetizer isn't needed unless you want to order them. 

On weekends, it's probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait 25-35 mins for just 2 people, but they do accept walk-ins as well if you're up for the wait or just in the area. 

Average bill for 2 ppl with 2 orders of side Caesar's salad and 2 beverages, excluding alcohol...is roughly $40. That price for good food, fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times before. Never been treated like I was last night. Made reservations for 7 pm and didn't get seated until I had to complain and that was 715 pm despite the fact I showed up at 6:30 pm. I was even told I could get seated before 7:00 pm. Then to top it off. Other customers got there food before us and we had our order done before they sat down. Was not treated very good for being a local. Can't refer you to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"So my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves Italian food. We were on the strip and I remembered hearing about this place, so we decided to give it a try. This place definitely has some old world charm, it feels a bit like dining at your nonna's house. In typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts, I love Las Vegas! The place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic. We tried to maneuver the table a bit, but it was a tight fit even for me, and I am pretty small. Regardless, it was a bustling Saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table.

Of course we started with the bread and it was delicious. I always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread. After checking out the portion sizes on other tables, I opted for a Caprese salad, figuring I could scavenge off of everyone else's plates. The slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large, I like mine to be a bit more dainty, but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me. I usually add salt to my Caprese, but in this case it was perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered the Rigatoni D, which features chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce. It was definitely delicious! I appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish. It was even better reheated the next day! My dad had the baked Ziti and it was also well done. It had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage. I stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner. My mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good. I feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isn't very difficult to make, and they had a pretty standard version. 

I was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant. It made my picky dad happy and I would definitely return. It is not the best Italian food in town, but not bad if you're in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"The service was great and the staff were nice but we found an eye lash buried in our lobster pasta!! That ruined the meal"}
{"text":"A much better and more reasonable priced option on the strip. It really captures the essence of an old school Italian joint and the food was excellent and reasonably priced with all things considered. We ordered the chicken marsala which was to die for as well as a ceasar salad and grilled salmo"}
{"text":"Ate here Sunday for lunch with a friend for the first time.. We had a looong night/early morning & wanted some good food after our check out.

I ordered the mushroom ravioli.. Which would have been great had it not been so damn salty. I literally was only able to eat 2 pieces of ravioli.
I don't remember what my friend ordered but it looked SO good.

Service was great. No complaints &the location is great."}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving and the food was subpar...cold, turkey and ham were dry and the lettuce was dead in the salad. Tried to contact a manager via their website and still no one has contacted us. My expectations were a little higher considering it was a holiday. We won't be back"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for years so when my friend suggested Maggiano's after hanging out at the mall I was looking forward to a cozy Italian meal. We were seated outside with 4 other tables, 2 of which had already paid their checks. After pouring over menus and talking for 25 minutes, we realized that another table had arrived nearby and had their drink orders. The girl working went to every other table and totally ignored us. We hadn't even had a server greet us. We were both shocked and hungry and honestly it was 8:30 on a Wednesday (tonight) so we figured we'd grab her attention and enjoy our meals. After passing the 30 minute mark, we decided that if she hadn't acknowledged us soon, we were out. 40 minutes after being seated, no one offered us drinks, let alone food. We probs shouldn't have stayed as long as we did but honestly we were hungry and shocked... and could have been forgiving. Doubtful anyone missed us when we left. Save your time. Go elsewhere! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Maggiano's has been my go to for casual Italian dining for many years, so when I heard a new Summerlin location opened, I knew I had to check it out. My first impression was that this location lacked the charm of the other Maggiano's I've dined at in the past. Instead of the typical dark, old-school vibe of the past, the restaurant has a casual feel with lots of square tables in an open dining room that seems to span the entire restaurant. Although the large windows throughout are a nice touch, I personally didn't care for the open feel of this particular Maggiano's. 

We were lucky enough to be seated in one of the restaurant's very few booths, but overall, the ambiance was still lacking. The food was great; the visiting Chef from Costa Mesa really went above and beyond by making gluten-free, vegan fried zucchini from scratch (cornstarch slurry then coated with crushed potato chips--very highly recommended!). Because I have not dined while the resident Chef is overseeing the kitchen, I cannot generalize whether the food is as excellent when the visiting Chef was there. I would still expect you can't go wrong with the Downtown Summerlin location since Maggiano's food tends to be very consistent across their many locations."}
{"text":"The quality of food and service was exceptional! We were seated promptly in the bar area (as we requested to watch a baseball game). Usually you give up some service when seated in a bar area, but not here! Everyone was great! We were greeted with waters to start and before we knew it apps were on the table! TRY THE CRAB CAKES!!!! Seriously amazing! I also recommend the \"lighter fare\" chicken Alfredo, so good! You won't leave hungry that is for sure! We had plenty to take home & overall a great time!"}
{"text":"service good food cold .....got a new dish...still lukewarm....everyones was, It was not busy Chef came out with new dish...could not say anything as he would not leave until I tasted it AWKWARD........ and salty"}
{"text":"Worst banquet event EVER.  Table of 10 received a small cereal sized bowl of ziti noodles and a smaller bowl of red sauce.  The chicken dish has 8 small slivers of chicken and then a basket with 6 slices of bread?  Really?  The servers stood around while we refilled our own water after walking to get the water pitchers at the service station  (where they were standing). Oh and a small portion of tomato Basil bruschetta was put down with a small salad prior to the \"entree\". Some of the people were allowed 4 noodles so others had something. Plates weren't cleared.  The dessert course made an appearance AFTER most guests left and it was a small plate of cookies. I won't be back.  3 years of this and it's gotten worse each year we have our banquet here."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight (not for the first time) and it was stellar. The staff was attentive and friendly, and you get a feeling that they work well as a team and enjoy their jobs. At our table, we had two vegans and one person who is allergic to shellfish. After hearing of our dietary requirements, our waiter summoned the sous chef to our table to explain the menu and the ways he could accommodate us. What a pleasant surprise! This place has great food, and if you order an entree from the Classic Pastas portion of the menu, you get a second helping to take home with you. That's a fabulous deal. The expansive dining room feels like a classy restaurant of the 40s. As we exited through the lobby, the hostess said goodnight and thanked us for coming, putting a pleasant cap on a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 5 around 9:30pm. We ordered the lamb special which was delicious. Gnocchi and lighter side fettuccine and lasagna was delicious. The service and food was amazing."}
{"text":"We like Maggiano's and went here (even though there are a million other places to try in Vegas) because we really wanted good Italian food. This location was a little classier than some other Maggiano's i have tried, and i expected that.  The food did not disappoint. 

Our waiter was  attentive enough but we sat outside (it was a lovely evening) and if you were trying to make it to a show or something you should be sure to tell your server. we definitely took our time and enjoyed the evening. 

sometimes you just need something that you know will not be a gamble, and this Vegas Maggiano's is one of them."}
{"text":"This could've been our last meal at Maggianos if it wasn't for our server and 1 of the bartenders. 

The server was awesome! I believe his name was Eric. 

The bartender who made my first drink was Brenda she was a miserable lady!

But the 2nd drink was made by a very kind African American man which I didn't get his name. 

The person who left a bad taste in our mouth was this female hostess, who was so rude that we almost left(twice ). Thank goodness for everyone else or else tonight would've been our last meal at Maggianos."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE - best food, best service & great atomosphere.  Can't believe it's rated 4 stars.  I rarely give 5 stars and this place gets it for sure.

Manager came to us after being served  just to make sure we were happy too.

Professional, well trained staff.

The best sweet Italian dressing for salad, mushroom ravioli is over the top the best!  Food always hot and fresh and served timed perfectly.  Never have to ask for more water or bread as staff always notice.

Our 1st place to head when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been going to Maggiano in Chicago for years and it's always been consistently good.  This location doesn't live up to their reputation.  Service was slow and not helpful on recommendations.  Twice, they brought me a bottle of corked wine (after the first one, you would think that they would have checked it before bringing me another).  One of our meals was Eggplant Parm...  very good.  The country style pasts was ok, but nothing amazing. My meal was Gluten free pasta with clams and white sauce.  It was WAY too soupy, and the garlic was too raw.  Also, their gluten free pasta is TERRIBLE.  There is a lot of good GF pasta, they need a new one at Maggiano's.

Drinks were slow to refill, service was adequate but not attentive and  the review on the food at our table ranged from good to bad.  It's just not the Maggiano's in Chicago"}
{"text":"Received a call from the Manager! He said that he was very sorry for the reservation problem and also about the food experience and offered us to come back and mention his name and they will make sure that it will be one of our favorite experience and restaurant again. Thank You Maggiano's!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian chain concept, but it doesn't have a chain feel once you are inside. Looks upscale with ornate Italian decor. Great specials on the week days. Portion are big so you can get half size portions or split it. I would stay with the classic Italian dishes for the best results. A serious Beef Braciola. Really good! Not a bad wine list. Consistent from location to location. I have experienced very good service at all locations I visited.
Great location for large groups and they know how to handle them efficiently."}
{"text":"Didn't get my meal. The waitress came and said she had chewed out the kitchen for forgetting my food, then later came back and said it was actually she who had forgotten to place it. Wow. Poor kitchen staff. She finally brought me food, after the rest of my party of 8 had completely finished, so I forced some of it down quickly because I was starving.... Which also wasn't that good. One of my friends got a dish with meatballs that I tried, and that was delightful. 

Overall- meh."}
{"text":"Had the eggplant Parmesan and the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert everything was very tasty. Liked the warm table bread as well, sat at the bar wish the bartender was a little more friendlier or would have gave this place a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was a good place to get good italian food, the prices were alittle high, but it was better than other Italian places to eat. Also the views are pretty nice, you get to sit next to the big open bay windows. I would recommend this place to anyone, but they are busy so please make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"Love Maggianos! Great italian food has never tasted so good. Portions are large so be sure to eat family style. We took our 1 1/2 old daughter and she even loved the place. Seating can be really busy but don't worry as the food makes up for it! Prices are reasonable and not over the board so it's definitely a place to visit. Great location in the middle of the strip and at the mall!"}

{"text":"Maggiano's failed horribly today! I flew back home to celebrate my birthday with my wife, who was very excited because I finally gave in to trying her favorite restaurant, Maggiano's. The problems started immediately. We were told that there is a 15 minute wait, which is expected because it is restaurant week. We waited 33 minutes exactly to be seated and that was after I went inside to check on why we had not been seated yet. Once we were seated, the server took about 6 minutes to greet us. My wife informed him that it was my birthday and to bring me an Old Fashion made with Woodford Reserve with a splash of St. Germaine. When I did finally get my drink, it was watered down and there was NO St. Germaine at all. Our calamari came out cold, but I was starving so we ate it. The server took forever to check on us, so we simply told him of the problem in hopes he would step his service up. My wife's filet and risotto came out GREAT! BUT, AND THIS IS A HUGE BUT, my gnocchi and Italian sausage was lukewarm at best. I wanted to complain, but the server again took forever to come back and check on us so I ate it. When he did finally ask how the meal was, I told him that I wish my food had been hotter and I was not impressed with the food nor the service this far. He simply apologized and collected the dishes, not once offering anything more than desert. We paid and left, unsatisfied and disappointed. I have worked in the restaurant industry before and I have worked Restaurant Week in Charlotte. This experience makes me feel like he didn't even care about us as guest. My birthday dinner was horrible. My wife still tipped him 25% because we know how it is to work for tips. That should be all the more motivating to him as a server to bring his \"A\" game to each table. This was disappointing to me, but more for my wife because she promised me an experience I would never forget. Maggiano's is her favorite restaurants in Charlotte and then to have it fail on my birthday, made her upset because it did not live up to the hype she put behind it. I will probably never go back to this establishment again, but I do hope that they read this and make adjustments with the serving staff. This was not to focus on a particular server, so that is why I did not name said server in this review. If you do decide to eat here, go when there are no big events going on. Maybe then you can get the service and experience that was promised to me, but fell so drastically short of."}
{"text":"Being from Italy I usually avoid going to Italian places to eat unless someone else I know eulogizes it. My girlfriend tried this restaurant about a week ago and she loved it. So we had to go back for brunch. 

It's so lovely to find a brunch place that doesn't have the waiting list on a Sunday morning. And it's even better when their staff welcomes you with big smiles and enthusiasm. Ben was our waiter and he did great. Very attentive and personable. 

But the quality of the food is mostly why this restaurant deserves five stars. Everything was fresh: from the crab cakes Benedict (one of the best I ever tasted) to the yogurt parfait and crème brûlé French toast. 

The menu is not very extended as far as brunch, but I guess it's better have few fresh and delicious dishes rather than a list of thirty or forty items you can't choose with ingredients out of a can.

Prices are a bit higher comparing to other breakfast/brunch places ($20 for crab cake Benedict and $14 for creme brûlé French toast) but again, it's about QUALITY. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with the whole experience and we'll definitely go back for brunch or dinner. 

Keep in mind that they also deliver! Ask the delivery menu to your waiter! 
Buon appetito! :-)"}
{"text":"We had reservations for my nephews college graduation our table was ready for us when arrived! The restaurant was clean.  our waiters were extremely professional! We had a very large party so we ate family-style, that means you order the food when you place the reservation and they will bring out the courses as you complete them! No long waiting or lag time ! the food was hot, appetizing and delicious! The service was excellent!"}

Every. Single. Thing. Just absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Maggianos never fails to exceed my expectations. Amazing service and amazing food every time. Not to mention the amazing military discount. Love coming here for date night."}
{"text":"Dined here on 7/10... 3 stars because the food was so delicious. The service however, was substandard. The waiter wasn't very friendly, rushed us into ordering, forgot to bring our drinks as well. Not sure if will dine here again, as this wasn't the first Maggiano location who didn't provide good service, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Nice view if you get a window seat. So so service. Good food. I like to come here once in a while for the stuffed mushrooms, calamari, lobster carbonara, and the dessert sampler which is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here the last night of our Vegas vacation. The atmosphere was wonderful. The food...out of this world.  I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were. We would have paid similar to our local Olive Garden only way better and would have had to wait an hour to get a table. I would highly recommend Maggianos.  Our waitress asked if we were having a special occasion and we told her we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary and she brought us out complimentary dessert with lit candles."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 3 because I have had some very good meals there. But today I had their Shrimp Risoto Special and it was pretty terrible. Not inedible. But not up to their normal quality. 

I know Risoto can be a tough dish, but if you can't make it well maybe you should just stay away from it."}
{"text":"Scratch that and bump the stars down, won't be back called way ahead of time for a large party, the lady that supposedly wrote it down, did not get it correct. Half the party was left standing and they basically refused to accommodate the rest of the party even though reservations were made days in advance. Needless to say we left and went to the PUB"}
{"text":"We went to Maggiano's for our annual Christmas dinner and it was great! The people, the music, the feel of the restaurant sitting by the windows and looking out at the lights did give the spirit we were looking for. The food was a little off this year. The calamari was as great as I remember (the bread was) and even though you get to take an identical pasta dish home if you order one, I really didn't want to take it home. I would have given it a fifth star if they had White Street beer on tap!"}
{"text":"I love Maggiano's!! It is great for big parties. My family and I are a huge fan of the Family Style Lunch. 

http://www.maggianos.com/foodbeverage/default.asp?menu=Family%20Style%20Lunch

You get two choices of appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. They also refill the plates. So if you finish your appetizer, they'll give you another one and if you don't finish it they let you box it up. 

My favorites are the Calamari Fritte, Stuffed Mushrooms and the Tiramisu!!!

Everyone in the world needs to celebrate one event in their life at Maggiano's. It is totally worth the price."}
{"text":"Location - 4 
Food - 4 
Service - 1 
Speed - 2 

This place is easy to find, especially since it's inside the mall. The menu is pretty large so you're bound to find something you'll like. The server spent a little too much time trying to convince us to order menu items we weren't interested in. After ordering and eating the food, we were all stuffed. The server came around to offer the dessert menu and when we turned it down, his attitude completely changed! His charm quickly disappeared and he became quite rude and short, especially when we asked to split the check. It's not our fault he didn't ask how we wanted the check before he delivered it."}
{"text":"Love \"the Godfather\" look and feel of this place.  If you can reserve a booth, do so!  
As for the food: EVERYTHING I have had here has been good, and I have been here quite a few times.  Chicken and Spinach Manicotti is my favorite dish.  The Mushroom Ravioli al Forno is a close second, for my vegetarian days.  
Appetizer: Fried zucchini was not what I expected, it was WAY better!  Large lengthwise slices of crisp zucchini breaded and perfectly fried and served with a creamy Parmesan dipping sauce.  Stuffed mushrooms are equally good.
Dessert: APPLE CROSTADA.  It is out of hand!  Sooooo good you will have trouble sharing.  Nonna's Toasted Pound cake with caramelized Banana's is also very, very good.
Do make reservations!  The wait time is ridiculous without."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Nice atmosphere, no long waits, food is great! Best of all, it's located on the Strip within the Fashion Show Mall. My only advice? Arrive by 6pm for dinner, or you may have a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"We went to Maggiano's for my birthday. The food was good, although I felt like my steak was drowning in gravy. It's not something I'm used to - maybe that's just how it's prepared. My wife referred to her pasta as \"perfectly cooked\". It's tough to please her, so that  means something! The margarita flatbread was AMAZING. Hands down the best food of our entire Vegas vacation.

The service was great. Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. He came with what we needed, asked if we needed anything, and was off. I like that. Now, I need to say something special about the service. The table next to us was very rude to our waiter over how the sauce was presented - not prepared, just presented. He handled it very well, as did the manager.

Little tip: make a reservation. Otherwise you'll be waiting longer than you'd like."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception at Maggianos on 8.10.13 after our wedding ceremony at Wynn Las Vegas.  It was 5+ STARS!  They took excellent care of us and we planned everything from out of town (we live in LA).  The reception could not have been more perfect and everyone at Maggianos made it so easy for us!  Our banquet captain Jessie Mzoughi was incredible!  I highly recommend them for your reception or any event!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was great! We sat right next to the window and had a nice view of the Wynn and the strip. It had a nice classy feel. Attire ranged from casual t-shirt and shorts to full suit and dresses. Food was fantastic! Service was good. Chicken parmesan was perfect and enough for 2 people to split. My wife had lobster carbonara and loved it also. Park in the fashion mall parking behind it for free!"}
{"text":"After a long and tiring day at Magic tradeshow, the team came here to feast! I was pretty hyped since it was my first time. The 5 of us ordered the classic family style which was I believe $35 a person. Not that cheap, but do-able.

Service was utterly non-existent. Food took forever inbetween servings, we're talking about 20-25 min inbetween each dish...even appetizers..

That's pretty damn bad. As you could expect, we got full just sitting there, so had so much food non taken advantage of.

Maggiano's...not a good way to treat the customers. 

If I come back..and that's a pretty strong IF, I would hope they actually serve our table.

Meh.

{"text":"In a couple more dinner visits to Maggiano's I got to sample an amuse bouche of a tiny but tasty Black Forest Ham & melted White Cheese Sandwich; oozing Mozzarella Marinara; excellent golden Calamari Fritte (both rings and tentacles) served with a serviceable Marinara Sauce and specially requested Lemon Aioli; a cup of Tuscan Sausage & Orzo Soup with irregularly shaped sausage and Ditalini pasta; a side of Caesar Salad with two anchovies; cheesy Fontina Potatoes; very good but not quite fork tender Veal Marsala with Button Mushrooms and Marsala Sauce accompanied by Hand-Cut Fettuccine; great Spaghetti, Meat Sauce, & Button Mushrooms with rich Red Sauce flowing over a huge, well-constructed Meatball and a pleasantly mild Sausage link; and a soothing and sweet Apple Crostada with Caramel Sauce.   Service was excellent and accommodating on all recent outings, and seating in leather booths quite comfortable.  

The old school Italian ambiance prevalent here seems genuine and unpretentious.  With fine authentic food to match, no wonder this Strip-based slice of Little Italy is always packed with enthusiastic diners."}

IF YOU WANT ITALIAN FOOD,,,YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO TO MACARONI GRILL,,WAY MUCH BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE....."}
{"text":"Food: Food here was excellent. I had the chicken parmigiana which also came with a side of spaghetti or fettuccine . The spaghetti was delicious and the chicken was also very tasty and moist. Portions were huge,especially for lunch time!

Price: Prices are modercheap! why go to an expensive Italian place on the strip when you can dine here for half the price and get good quality food!

Atmosphere: I liked dining here. It was quiet, relaxing and great for groups or family dining.

Service: Service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Our water glasses were always refilled. 

Location: Located in Fashion Show Mall on the second floor. Great to dine after/before shopping!"}
{"text":"Vorneweg - das Ambiente ist klasse, der Service sehr gut, und das Essen ist auch hervorragend.
Man kann hier in einer gemütlichen Atmosphäre einen schönen Abend verbringen. Der Service ist hilfsbereit, immer zu Stelle und entspricht allen positiven Vorurteilen.
Zum Essen aber einen Hinweis: Es schmeckt ausgezeichnet aber es macht sehr satt, die Größe der Portionen ist landestypisch. Die Menge des Käses auf den Gerichten auch und ebenso die Menge der Schokolade auf dem Tiramisu. Vielleicht ein wenig überladen für europäischen Geschmack - aber keinesfalls schlecht. Mit landestypisch ist hier übrigens nicht typisch italienisch gemeint..."}
{"text":"First time at the one here in vegas. 

 The wait for 2 people was like an hour but it wasn't a big deal. 

 Italian food is always suppose to be very large portions and super filling which is where they kinda screwed up on this particular occasion. 

 I got the lobster ravioli full order (23.50) and ended up getting a plate with 8 raviolis on it. 8. I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes. (could have been 2 but I was eating slow) I asked the waitress about my order and she said that was a 1/2 order and about 10 minutes later they brought me some more ravioli. Well not much more. 5 more to be exact. 

 So my advice to you is to only order family style here with a group of people and avoid coming with any less than 4 folks. You just won't get the same bang for your buck. 

 Nice wine list and there were a few banquet rooms / wine cellar rooms that the dining seemed to be really nice in. 

 There's a much bigger restaurant right above this one that I am gonna have to try out because it really looked nice."}
{"text":"Pros Cons, then summary.

Went here with a large group for Thanksgiving.

PROs--The food was good.  We had various dishes in our three course meal, but it was good overall.  The place is nice and well decorated, and the restrooms were clean.  The waiter was nice too and very helpful.

CONs--Small portions for a large group.  It was too pricey for the amount of food we got.  This place is not really accommodating for large groups.  They say they are, but will not make the effort to have groups larger than 20. 

Would I go back? No.  Too much money and not enough food.  The waiter was nice, but those making the decisions about reservations need to be better understanding."}

We came for my birthday with a big group and our waiter really doted on us but my pasta did not have enough sauce and was kind of dry and crunchy. I love that they offer gluten-free pasta. My kids are crazy about their Alfredo sauce."}
{"text":"My buddies and I decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers.  The delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night.  The family style is a great way to enjoy the meal.  They provide a lot of food for their prices.

We started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite.  It's rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Next up was the Beef Braciole.  This dish was quite interesting.  The texture was weird yet it was edible (may have been my hangover dulling my senses).  I can't quite remember the name of the next dish, but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls, I believe.  The spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state.  You can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs.  We also had the Rigatoni \"D\".  The chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying.  

They gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner.  If you love Italian food and pastas, this place would be a place to stop by."}
{"text":"Good services, food was average nothing really special. Location was great. The atmosphere was good. The booth had ripped seats."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm; if you enjoy Italian food, come here.  Every meal starts off with bread and olive oil, and, if you want (I highly recommend), some balsamic vinegar.  Then, you can dive into your entrees.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli (which came recommended by our waiter-he was very knowledgeable, which was refreshing), and my friend ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  Both were amazing.  For a drink, order the Sangria; it is fresh and tasty, perfect on a hot, Vegas day."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in the world! Just being in the restaurant made me feel as if I was in Italy. The food is delicious and prices are reasonably fair. Whenever we're in Las Vegas, Maggiano's is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Greal hidden spot in the Fasion Show Mall. Amazing prices on daily happy hour. Great salad and soup selection. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Reliably good food and reasonably priced considering location, atmosphere, and quality of food.  I got into Maggiano's from when I lived in the Chicago area (their location downtown there), and I'm glad they have one here.

Entrees are priced a few bucks more than Olive Garden and/or Macaroni Grill, so it's actually an exceptional value.  Cheese ravioli are amazing, as is the buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  Always a few good draft beers on tap to choose from, and the portions are quite large (family style).  Gnocchi is highly recommended also.

Reservation recommended."}
{"text":"Love the food here, it's extremely good, and I definitely recommend the daily specials. The outdoor patio is fantastic and as there's few places on the strip where you can eat outdoors, this is a great option for dining al fresco. Service is good, but it can take a while for your food to arrive.

One of the reasons I chose this place is that they will prepare your dish gluten free on request, if you ask. They also can substitute regular pasta with gluten free pasta.

Good selection of wines by the glass, but it's rather expensive. $16 a glass is out of my league. However, they do have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm Mon-Fri with a selection of beer, wines and cocktails for $6 or less.

{"text":"25 minute wait for a table on a Tuesday night. Pasta was bland and tasteless. No freshly grated cheese offered, just the dry leftover parmesan cheese powder in a shaker on the table. My \"crusted chicken\" had no crust, just the browning of the egg it had been dipped in. From my experience the food here is below average. The 2 \"gift meals\" we took home were no better.  I really don't understand why this place has so many customers. Cheesecake Factory makes a better pasta than this place. They have nothing on other \"scratch kitchen\" Italian restaurants like Carrabbas.  I'm giving it two stars because the tiramisu was actually good. (maybe not made on site?)"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service for a banquet I attended tonight. We paid $25 a head and were brought a small bowl of noodles and 8 pieces of chicken for a 10 top. After notifying the manager, the servers then brought out another plate of both, but with only 3 pieces of chicken cut in half. I guess this was supposed to make it 6 pieces of chicken. Horrendous portion size and service less than par. The servers stood around and talked instead of bussing tables or filling waters. On top of that, the dessert was not brought out until people were leaving. I will never spend another penny at this establishment and cannot imagine recommending it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Loved, Loved, Loved this place. The bread is just mediocre. The wine was refressing. I had the ziti and it was good. Hubby had chicken and spinach manicotti and he enjoyed it. Cons: had to wait for 10 minutes for an employee to come out of the family restroom, like really? I would come back again!"}
{"text":"First of all loved our waitress. Secondly food was good except the creme bruleé was burnt but whatever we ate around it. Cool place, will be back."}
{"text":"I have now been to this location twice. The food is always very good, but I also think the staff is outstanding. We will continue to visit this location when we want good Italian food. I live all the way over in the west Valley and it's worth the trip. I have enjoyed the mussels and the chicken parm. You,ve got to try the Nutella cheesecake."}
{"text":"I have only been to Maggianos a couple of times.  First time I ever went, I went as a group b-day party, and it turned out to be close to $40/person with tips and taxes for a buffet type meal with regular drink.  It took me about 5 years to go again after that scenario, as my friend convinced me to give it a shot with a regular menu.  I went last weekend to the location in North Scottsdale.  It was a very popular location because we had about a 1.5 hour wait.  Luckily, they had a pretty decent size bar where my friend and I had a drink.  I had the sangria, and it was very tasty.

We got our tables very close to our estimated 1.5 hours and got seated with rather quick service.  The waiter would catch what we said, and then he would literally run.  I don't know if that is the culture because of the high volume of customers or that this guy just liked to walk away fast.  We both got chicken dishes that were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great dinner. I had shrimp pasta dish. Excellent! And the bread pudding desert was wonderful! Not too sweet , just perfect!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying all of my other experiences with Maggiano's have been positive. But last night was BAD.

We had a group of 9 for dinner. Calamari appetizer was good as usual. This month they have an ahi tuna dinner special. 4 people in our party ordered it. It was absolutely horrible. I told my teenager not to eat it because it literally looked like food poisoning on a plate. It was extremely over cooked. The other 3 ate around the tuna also because of how over cooked and mushy it was. My mother ordered the gnocchi with a white sauce. She described it was throw up on a plate. The sauce was either not what she ordered as it was more a very pale red (almost like a vodka sauce) and she said the gnocchi were gummy. She said it was similar to pasta that had been reheated a few times. Our waiter actually ended up removing her plate from our bill because she didn't eat any of it. My aunt and I had chicken dishes. Her the chicken parm and me the Marsala. Ours were edible but our chicken was sooooo dry neither one of us ate much. My uncle had the pasta pesto which he said was fine. And my youngest had the kids spaghetti and meatball which was ok. 

Our waiter was friendly and the cocktails and wine were good. But when a meal is over $500 you shouldn't have to order food online to pick
Up at the Cheesecake Factory next door after you leave b/c everyone is still starving. 

I'm really hoping this isn't the new normal for Maggiano's. We've celebrated mother's/fathers days there, family dinners etc and have always had delicious meals. Let's hope things pick up again soon. Unfortunately it will be a long time before we go in to check."}
{"text":"Best Thanksgiving dinner!!!  Misty made our evening so pleasurable!
Preset menu...family style...had lots to eat...even brought left overs for the next day!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars, because Maggiano's food quality is losing its touch.  They used to be amazing.  Overall I do like the location.  Theres a great view and its in a fun shopping mall.  The price of the food is expensive, so I do expect good service and food quality each time I go.  If you can tell the difference between good Italian and great Italian then this place might be a hit or miss depending on the chef.  If not, then you will think this place is outstanding."}
{"text":"I've never been to any Maggiano's, so being invited for dinner was a welcome treat.  It was fairly crowded for a Monday night, but tables were available, so we were seated immediately.

Our hostess ordered two appetizers for our table for four - calamari and stuffed mushrooms.  I was thrilled, because those crustaceans are off-limits when it's just the hubby and me.  He won't touch them.  They were decent, not the best I've ever had, but good enough.  The stuffed mushrooms were simply ordinary.

Herb had chicken marsala, and it, too, was ordinary, and really chintzy on the mushrooms.  My salmon was overcooked and dry.  The spaghetti that accompanied the mains was good, perfectly al dente, with a flavorful marinara sauce.

We all shared tiramisu and a piece of cheesecake for dessert, and those were the best parts of the meal.

While service was good and the ambience is woodsy and inviting, I can think of many other Italian restaurants that have better food at a similar (or lower) price point, so I don't think we'll be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sous chef came out because I had a nut allergy and talk to me directly to make sure everything would be okay. The food was great. I had the chicken parmesan and it was crispy and the Ragu was very tasty. To finish the meal we had lemon cookies which was incredible."}
{"text":"You're probably wondering, why would anyone go to Maggiano's during their Vegas trip?  Hey, I love Maggiano's and when you know there's a good place to eat (whether it's Vegas, Boston, Philly, etc) you stick to it!
As always, they never disappoint me.  I ordered the same stuff as I always do- their mussels for appetizer and of course, I always order chicken and spinach manacotti, which is yummy.  
I stayed at MGM but I walked all the way over to fashion mall, just to eat at Maggianos and no regrets, b/c it was totally worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"The only Maggiano's that has awesome customer service and YUMMY FOOD. One of the smallest I've been to. They do have rooms if you want an event done there. You can only have a small wedding reception up to 60 people no more then that. It's located at The Fashion Mall at the very end of the place. They do have a outside patio. It is a very romantic place with the view of The Strip. The food is so much better the The Olive Garden more authenic in you're face. The food stick to you're ribs. You'll never leave hungry. 



F.Y.I
This location where you order a glass of wine. They put the wine in a smaller bottle. You pour what you want in the wine glass. But there is still some more I would say 1/4 left in the small bottle you get more for you're money that way."}
{"text":"Maggiano's is a good place! The service is great. The food is appetizing. My boyfriend and I enjoy sitting in the outside area with the strip view.  We always have a few cocktails and share some good food.... and people watch! Great place to spend an afternoon!"}
{"text":"Great food ....great service. Tracy was great!! Large portions! Food was loaded with favor!! No complaints at all!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying!! Food was delicious, & waitresses were so nice. 

I was not a big fan of Italian food, but spaghetti we ordered was soo good! 

And u get a free spaghetti gift when u order one spaghetti! 

If u r going, do call to reserve a table beforehand, sooo many people waiting in line."}
{"text":"Slow Slow Slow service.   The food was good for me, my husbands filets were tough so he did not like it.  Kids liked their food but waiting 45 for the main course was a big turn off for us."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  I forgot our servers name, he was great.  He served my girlfriend a treat for her birthday without question."}
{"text":"Great dishes here but honestly the Alfredo here is very bland! If you can't make Alfredo what can you make? Who gets Alfredo sauce wrong??? Too much hype and also very very expensive for such fair sized portions. I mean it's not small nor big but enough if you keep eating bread. Rather go to Olive Garden honestly. Good service and great happy staff. Just the food was a bit disappointing . Stars are for the service from the server and bus boy?"}
{"text":"Fantastic franchise that makes you feel like you are part of the familia, Maggiano's has an excellent template of a menu replicated at each location. This particular location is given special attention because it's in Vegas. The view is brilliant from the corner window tables, very romantic. Some days there is a violinist strolling around playing requests. Try the calamari and Maggiano's salad to begin with, stuffed mushrooms aren't bad either. Traditional fare is great, lasagna and angel hair pasta with Arrabiata sauce. Finish with tiramisu and a moscato, delicious."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant.  I think as far as value goes you get a great experience.  The views are great at this location.  Being right on the strip and having the whole wall on the strip side being windows it's a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels.  I've had so many different meals here and never been disappointed.  The chicken parm. the rigatoni D(my favorite pasta dish here) and the Marsala are all fantastic.  For the price it is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been too and have been going to this Maggianos location for the last four years.  I've been to places in Vegas that are twice the price, half the portion, and 1/4 the food quality.   Don't miss this place if your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Calamari is amazing, try the brushetta you won't be disappointed.   The service is impeccable.   Also......sangria, OMG"}
{"text":"I came here with my family before work one day. Everything I ate was so flavorful! I think I almost cried when I ate the dessert because I had never had anything like it. The waiter was very personable and the service was great. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several several times the last time I was in there it was just recently it's always packed unless you're there on a weekday early for lunch meeting up with our friends are usually order the same things I love their eggplant I like to sit at the bar with that really tall guy with the brown hair I forget his name he is nice they have a very nice tiramisu 
I always bring home a kid lasagna for my son when I leave parking is a little tricky because they have valet and then heaven forbid you park at the maul it's hard to find so you kind of wanna enter from the outside rather from the maul because you will get lost or have to walk across the more but be wary of the evenings because it does get very packed and you are going to wait and wait and wait is inside outside and private rooms cleanliness is good the food is good there have a nice calamari are usually just sit at the bar I don't think I've ever sat at the Maggiano's here in Vegas at a actual table
What's funny is that the first time that I came in here it was pretty early in the afternoon and I was sitting right across the bar from the actor Kevin Pollack from a few good men and many other movies I am medically recognised him he was sitting with a woman and I joked around and hollered across the bar hey I know you want you my gym teacher from North Bergen high school and he said of course I am it was pretty cool

This definitely isn't a celebrity hotspot or anything like that it was just random
If you can get out on a lunchtime where there is not a crowd I'll tell you this place can be great but when it's busy you are going to wait to be seated you are going to wait for your drinks you are going to wait for your food you are going to wait for your check it is loud and it's so hard to get out of there"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Perfect for groups with their family style plates.  Deep fried zucchini is a must."}
{"text":"Great location in Vegas. Food is god, price is reasonable.Nothing too especial about it. Very small outdoor seating great indoors."}
{"text":"The wait staff couldn't seen to get anything right tonight.  Everything was slow. Our entrees appeared before our salads and they tried to convince us that this was normal. When the entrees returned at the correct time, they'd suffered from sitting under heat lamps. Drinks remained unfilled even when refills were requested. Dirty dishes sat in front of us long after we finished eating.... When I visited the restrooms, all the waste cans were overflowing and there was trash all over the floors.  It as no surprise then when they failed to bring our daughter her birthday dessert. We reminded them, but unlike the chocolate desserts that were served to the other birthday tables around us, our daughter was disappointed to receive lemon cookies. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant for a great price! Me and my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant while walking to the strip of Vegas on our vacation, we were hungry and decided to give it a try and boy am I glad we did!!! The food and the service here was absolutely amazing! Our server was great! And we even got a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary. I am defiantly returning on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place!  I had the gnooki and Italian sausage. Fantastic. If your in Scottsdale this is a must stop"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and man i don't know how i never been here before.  It's a very nicely decorated restaurant that feels pretty fancy but it actually isn't that expensive.  We had a large group that got the family style dinner.  It was fantastic! everything was delicious and we were able to take home boxes of left overs.  it was like a buffet that was brought over to you.  large portions so you'll definitely get your moneys worth!  bring your eatin pants"}
{"text":"We walked in and the lobby was PACKED on a Thursday. I guess there were 2 huge parties at once, whose tables weren't prepared so they had them blocking the entrance. Wiggled my way up to the front bc we had a reservation. Took them 15 minutes to seat us, which makes no sense considering our reservation but whatever, I can move past that. We ordered a couple appetizers and 3 entrees.  The waiter forgot the appetizers and after we reminded him, they were delivered about 1 minute before the entrees.  The bigger problem was the food.  I ordered their 'classic baked ziti' and it was literally disgusting. Rubbery.  It was almost as though it had been sitting out for an hour or so and they just shoved it in the microwave. I guess that's what you get when it's buy one pasta, get one to take home.   That seemed like too good of a deal for 12.95$, which it was.  The beautiful decor and the valet parking indicate a great restaurant. This is just not the case."}
{"text":"Love it!!!!
I purposely starve myself when I know I'll be eating here!!!! I love sooo many of their menu items!!"}
{"text":"I generally stay away from chain Italian food.  That being said, the food was not bad.  I had a capresse salad and the tomatoes could have been of slightly higher quality, but otherwise it was ok.  Certainly good enough for a safe tourist meal."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this place because each time we pass by it always seems very crowded. I am from Italy and in a way I am spoilt as far as Italian restaurants are concerned. I was pleasantly surprised. Sophisticated atmosphere ( I was a little bit underdressed for this place lol ), 5 star service. Our servant Brandon was just wonderful, very quick and considering. The food was excellent. I recommend their salmon and clam chowder soup. The bread was warm and seemed home made. It was our first time and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ate here for my 21st bday. The server was very nice, I wish I could remember his name lol. There's was man walking around and he sang to me for my bday. Overall, great food and service!"}
{"text":"Maggianos has always been a family favorite.   Great food, generous portions and very good service.
Tonight we went to this new location.   It was packed so we ate in the bar.   Michelle was our waitress and she was awesome.   Even on a packed night the food came out fast and hot.     We ordered some food to take home.   Upon arriving home we realized that we were missing half of our order.    I called and the manager recognized that a customer had left without their full order and had chased out to find us.    He offered to take care of the situation but what is most impressive was the ease of taking care of the customers.   We will always go back.   My son loves the place so much that we had it catered for his wedding.   It is nice to see that the new Summerlin location holds the same high service and quality standards as the downtown location consistently has ."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 5 star based on ambience and service.    We were seated in the corner window seat with the most amazing view.  The waiter was great, and we couldnt have expected better service or view.   Unfortunately the food was not on point.  My lasagna was so salty that I couldn't finish it.   My wife and kids had a dish that after one bite it was so dry that you needed water just to swallow.    We love Magianos and will write this off as a bad night in the kitchen.   We will be back and will always recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I came up to Beachwood Mall with a couple of close friends. After shopping at Saks, we decided to walk accross to Maggiano's for a quick dinner before continuing to shop. 

All I have to say is that I was very impressed. 

The service was excellent. The food was superb. I had the cheese ravioli with a pesto creme sauce. It was delicious. So was the fresh bread and Fried Zucchini. 

On another note, and important to me, was the cleanliness. Very clean area and restrooms. 

My friends and I will most definitely be returning. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Food, get a large group of 4 or more and do the family style dinner and you will feast like you are in Italy. If you eat by ordering a smaller portion I would recommend the classic dinner where they give you an equal dinner to take home. I recommend the mom's lasagna and the baked ziti or spaghetti with meatballs. The flatbread pizza is great and the best pound cake you will ever have. We always get the lemon cookies to go in a tin container. Don't waste your money at Olive Garden"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 7 on a Friday night.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to open.  It was worth the wait.  My friend and I ordered the special dinner for about $43.00 for the 2 of us.  This gave us a large shared appetizer, 2 large servings of pasta dishes plus 2 to take home, and a monsterous desert.  All the food was very tasty.  My lasagna was very good as was my friend's pasta dish.  My take home was spaghetti and meatball and half the lasagna.  Our appetizer was the fried calamari which was done just right.  Service was attentive.  Given the amount of food its a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome service second to none Richard was outstanding. Enthusiastic about serving us, and especially enthusiastic about the quality and freshness of the food. Looking forward to our next visit. Antipasto plate had many selections. Lasagne was so good. Homemade noodles. Topped it off with the best cheesecake in town. Thanks Richard for the great service."}
{"text":"We have been going there for the last year at least once month.  We have made it our Birthday restaurant of choice.
  They always ask if you are celebrating anything and they decorate the table and give you a hand written card.  What a nice, personal touch!
  The first time I go to any Italian restaurant I order the white clam  sauce.  That's my barometer.  If it sucks, we do not go back.
  We go back!!   Holy smokes, they give me such a big bowl with tons of clams. I have enough to eat lunch the next day and then I can make some pasta and add it to make another meal.  For around $16.  3 meals!  
  Sign up for their emails and you receive a $10 off a $30 purchase each month.  They have specials that they notify you about as well.
  Not everyplace gives the birthday guest a free dessert, but Maggianos does.  
Get dessert, save room and get it - or bring it home.
   We have always had excellent service, but we eat early.  5 or 5:30.  Places are not usually too busy then, that is our little secret. The servers are fresh,"}
{"text":"We had a waitress arguing about little things.
We ordered sea food pasta and she charged $5.00 extras for 3 shrimps, $5.00 for 4 little pieces of imitation lobster and so on.
Size of the dish was pretty small and she brought us could bread, usually is warm.
Price for what we had, very expensive, plus we had to add extra salt and cheese to give flavor to the pasta, no flavor at all.
No more eating in this restaurant. 
(Want to mention that the manager was very nice and gave us 10% off.)"}
{"text":"I've been to Maggiano's three times in my life, and I'll have to say 1-star rating is one too many for all three experiences. 

We had an early evening reservation, and it was 10 minutes until the wait staff stopped by to greet and take the drink order. The family ordered the \"Classic Family Style\" dinner. We had fried calamari, spinach salad, and Italian sausage & roasted peppers for appetizer. The calamari was slightly over seasoned and average at best. The spinach salad was over dressed and soggy. The italian sausage was served in a pool of greasy sauce. The sausage itself was average, and I could have bought better sausage across the street at Whole Foods and made a better version at home. 

For the main course, we ordered linguini with clams, chicken saltimbocca, eggplant parmesan, and grilled salmon. If I had to guess, salt must have been on-sale this week. Since most of the clam meat in the linguini came from cans, this entree already started with a high doze of sodium. The linguini was probably also cooked in salted water. To top it off, the cooks must have popped the top off the salt shaker and dumped a half canister of salt in the clam sauce.  Next, the chicken saltimbocca must have been made by the same cook that made the linguini. It was again over seasoned. In fact, it was so salty that it made the prosciutto taste like sweet ham. The chicken, in addition, was forgotten in the oven too long and was dry like a cardboard. The third entree is the eggplant parmesan, and it was again extremely salty. The eggplant had more breading than eggplant. I also don't remember seeing a speck of parmesan in the entree. In all fairness, I cannot comment on the taste of the salmon since I didn't sample it. However, the reason why I didn't sample the salmon is because it was completely overcooked and the fish was bone dry when I cut into it with the serving spoon. 

For desserts, we ordered the creme brulee & tiramisu. The desserts would probably have been the only enjoyable parts of the dinner if we had eaten them on-site. We ended up boxing the desserts and took them home before they even made it to the table. I sampled both desserts the next day. The creme brulee wasn't extraordinary. The caramelized sugar was flamed just right. It is a bit awkward to eat creme brulee from a plastic takeout box instead of a ramekin. It came with a few slices of fresh strawberries which I find a bit strange. The tiramisu definitely deserved its name. I could taste the rum and the expresso. The lady fingers had the perfect consistency. The quality shaved chocolate garnish added extra depth to the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday dinner for my daughter with the whole family.  We love the atmosphere that never fails to make you feel like your at home.  The food is terrific!"}
{"text":"Service, ambiance and entrees were very good. I recommend giving this place a try. 

They accept reservations through open table."}
{"text":"I had received a gift card from this place so, once again, I decided to give it yet another chance. Sadly, once again, I was disappointed.  Let's start with the fact that they sat us at a table that was on the main walkway coming into the dining room at a round table which protruded into the walkway. Then they had a party of 12 sitting right behind us so that there was literally 18\" in between our chairs.  Within the first 10 minutes my chair had been bumped literally 18 times (yes, I counted! What's worse is that the waiter from the other table, who also reeked of cigarette smoke, bumped me 3 of those times!) Not only did he smell unappetizing but he never even apologized for bumping me and then continued to do it. I also had to move twice to accommodate a woman with a walker and a super-sized guest.  It get's better, they gave us this crappy seating for a 4:45 pm dinner reservation. Seriously?!!! The food was okay, but I'd prefer better quality ingredients instead of super-sizing the food in addition to sending more home with you.  Gonna have to cross this one of my list for good this time."}
{"text":"This weekend I had a beautiful private dining experience at Maggiano's at Fashion Show.  My friends hosted my baby shower in a private room (with a great view and patio included!) for 30 people, passed appetizers, food table, dessert table and open bar.  It turned out beautifully and I could not be happier!  We worked with Sabrina, banquet manager, who was superb.  She recommended a menu (which was delicious and everyone loved the food!) for my mixed group (vegetarians, kids and adults), and helped us orchestra a budget that worked for the hosts.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am to have someone so lovely and gracious be a part of my special afternoon with my dear friends and family.
I would do this again the exact same way and I'm looking for reasons to book another get-together in the same spot."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they have the classic pasta buy 1 get 1 free deal. Food wasn't bad, was actually pretty decent. Would come back but probably for to go.

Service - just for 4 people, it took forever to get a seat when the room only had 2 tables occupied. To top that off, my waitress was a real idiot. Couldn't get any of our orders correct then insults us. Awesome job AMY"}
{"text":"THIS IS BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!
   My wife and I had the most outstanding Italian dinner I have had in some time.
We decided to forego appetizers; and, go to their RESERVE WINE list for appetizer.
I selected a great Italian Barolo Pertinance from Piedmont Italy.  It was great!
  My entre was their Beef steak Lasagna.  It was just great.  The steak was tender, the Lasagna was super tasty with a great sauce.  It was one of best  Italian dishes I have had outside of Italy.
  My wife ordered Light Veal Piccata with a side of Sugar Snap Peas.  She said it was very tender and tasty.  I stole a couple bites of her Sugar Snap Peas; and, remarked they were a gourmet delight.
  The CHEFS at this restaurant are trully very professional; and, special.
For dessert we ordered Pumpkin Cheesecake; however,we were too full to have any, so we packed it up and took it home.
  I must compliment our super sharp, smart, and very professional server Cecilia Salario.  Ceci, as I will call her, was quick to our many requests and needs.  Such as extra water, extra glass with just ice, extra spoon,  taking our picture, etc.  When I return I must request her area!

sincerely,

Ed Altman  Jr."}
{"text":"One Sunday afternoon I finally made a trip out to Maggianos at the request of a friend. There was a stream of guests walking into the restaurant before us, I thought to myself that there would be a wait. There wasn't, and we were seated quickly. Our server was warm and friendly and made suggestions when I hesitated over the drink menu.

The calamari was absolutely delicious as I had expected. The pasta was yummy and I could not finish it all. I was very happy to take it home to devour the next morning for breakfast! No complaints whatsoever, I look forward to returning."}
