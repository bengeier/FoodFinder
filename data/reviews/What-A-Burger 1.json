{"text":"The What-A-Burger... what an iconic establishment for the Kannapolis Concord area. And for those of you who have Texas roots or connections...no, there is no connection to the What-A-Burger that you are familiar with. The North Carolina What-A-Burger actually predate the Texas units.  The best thing about the food I can say is that nothing has changed since I used to hang out here in my high school days back in the 1970s.   Most fast food places have evolved through all these years, and most in a negative fashion. Not What-A-Burger. The burger I got here yesterday was the same as what I enjoyed back in the seventies. Good quality beef, & a great locally made bun. Not the cheapest, but quality costs.  And really, is it not important to remember when something has always been good for 40+ years? Our North Kannapolis What-A-Burger isn't the slickest, the newest, the flashiest or the brightest in fast food today. What it does offer is consistent good fast food as it has been for years.   And I, for one, truly appreciate this."}
{"text":"I love this little burger joint in Kannapolis, NC for lunch when I am in the area. I'm giving it 5 stars because for fast food restaurants it is a 5. I love the classic building and drive in style parking. Service is good, the place is clean, it's quick, and it's good food. I definitely recommend this place as it is both a good place to eat and a blast from the past architecturally."}

{"text":"My husband and I have always enjoyed What-a-burger food, which is why we continued giving this particular restaurant (Store #1) \"one more chance\", but I think after tonight they're out of last chances.  Since childhood, my meal of choice has been a chopped barbecue sandwich with red slaw, an order of fries, and of course a witch doctor. I still highly recommend these items (or anything on the menu, honestly), but from any location other than store #1. They are almost ALWAYS out of red slaw when we stop in (I'd say close to 80% of the time), at least 3 times they've been out of barbecue, and the quality of the food is inconsistent from visit to visit.  But here's what did me in tonight. Hubby and I both ordered bbq sandwiches with red slaw (surprise, surprise... they ran out of red slaw yesterday), a large fry to share, and two drinks. Our ticket was printed at 6:19pm. People  who came in after us got their meals and left, and FINALLY at 6:36pm, our two bbq sandwiches and french fries were ready. The fries were undercooked and the barbecue was, in my opinion, not up to What-a-Burger par. We got no apology for not getting slaw OR for having to wait almost 20 minutes for \"fast\" food. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt if it was the first time it took so long to get my grub, but they're always slow there and don't seem to care. Most casual sit-down restaurants don't take that long. There are a couple other locations that are tried and true, so apparently I'll just have to drive a little further for good food and good service."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a dang witch doctor..... Alas my thirst was not quenched and my dreams were crushed because of course I didn't have $2.50 in cash all I had was a debit card on me. It's 2017 this place needs to get with the digital era and not just accept cash. Who the freak even carries cash anymore!?!?!"}
{"text":"After reading hundreds of Yelp reviews, I finally decided to write one. I'm happy my first one is for an old school burger joint you would expect to see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives from Food Network. It is a drive-in and the burgers are delicious! Everything was made to order, hot and inexpensive. The service was great and the staff friendly. When it was our turn to order we explained this was our first time there and the lady working the counter was patient and explained our options. I got the double cheese burger and it was super juicy! Just wish I lived closer than Charlotte because I'd hit this place up weekly."}
{"text":"Meh...it's a dirty, overrated burger joint. Staff is friendly but that is about where it stops. The food does not impress and certainly does not leave a lasting memory."}
{"text":"Great food all around! This location is open on Sunday unlike some of the others. This one also has a friendlier staff and the people working in the kitchen don't look scary. This is my favorite what a burger to visit and come here probably once a week. Can't beat the fountain cherry lemon suundrop, whata cheeseburger, fries, hotdogs, and anything else you see!"}
