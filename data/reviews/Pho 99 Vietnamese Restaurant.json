{"text":"Great everything, especially the pho. The place is clean, but it's a dump. Exactly the place I want to be for pho, but won't impress anyone with the decor or vibe."}
{"text":"I joined yelp specifically to write about this place. It's a gem  I order the bun cha gio (vietnamese spring roll + noodles) almost everytime and I can say it's the best in Markham for sure. Their pho is really good.  I lived in Vietnam for a while and this comes very close to the stuff you would get there. Keep doing your thing Pho 99"}
{"text":"The taste was average, but I'm not sure what other people are saying when they said the portions are generous. For a pho place, especially one that is not very busy, I wouldve expected my bowl to be at least full? 6.99 for a small... I usually get a small at all pho places and I can barely finish but I was done in about 10 minutes and still starving.The atmosphere is kind of dirty and reeks of bleach and disappointment. Sad to see a local business go down like this!"}
{"text":"Great pho.  Fast service.  Clean washrooms.  You read that right!  CLEAN bathrooms!  In the past there have been some consistency issues with the pho.  But overall it's the best pho I've had in Toronto, better than the more expensive places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Cost: cheap $ Quality: good Pho - 80% Decor: poor to none - 60% Staff: almost no service - 65% Value: 80%  Keeper? Yes, we go there regularly for Pho. There's a Kim Dinh nearby that would give you better experience."}
{"text":"Your basic Vietnamese food.  It was cheap and the food satisfied the hungry monster within. Nothing extraordinary food wise.  Nothing that I would say a must try or a must avoid.   Don't go for the ambiance since there isn't any. BUT.... that is not why we come here.  It is for reasonably priced food and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and $7 for a large bowl of Pho it's pretty filling though I always get the feeling that there just isn't enough beef slices to go around.  The customer service is a bit lacklustre but definitely not terrible otherwise I wouldn't have gone 3 times already."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch.  The service is minimal as you have to write your own order and help yourself to the utensils, napkins, etc. all on the table.  The server really only takes your order paper and bring your food.    We had the noodles with grilled beef and a spring roll.  The flavor was good.  The beef had a good grilled taste.  Quantity of serving is sufficient."}
{"text":"So...I don't know why anyone would actually come to this restaurant when there is a much cleaner, better-serviced, larger-portioned, similar-priced Vietnamese restaurant just steps away (literally).  I came here with my family on a weekday night because the other restaurant was busy...but I was really craving Pho and we didn't want to wait, so we settled for this place instead.  The restaurant was pretty empty when we went in. There was only ONE customer eating dinner in the back corner. The \"waitress\" told us to just sit wherever and the menus were already placed at each table, so she didn't bother to come and greet us.  Despite the run down look of the place, the prices were NOT low. It cost about $7 for a small bowl of pho (which is the same as the better neighboring restaurant). The rice dishes were all like $9.99+.  When the food arrived, my small pho was REALLY SMALL. As other reviewers have said, it's smaller than the average small you get at other restaurants. This really should be labeled as extra small. As for their rice dishes that my family ordered, they seemed decently sized. Flavour-wise, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either.  To summarize, this place is kind of like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but without the hole-in-the-wall prices and portions. All in all, I won't be coming back to this place again. I would rather wait for a table at the other restaurant than come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a pho restaurant close by to replace a favourite that had closed down and this is it!   The pho was serves fast and the portions are ample. The restaurant seems clean and comes with free tea. Also everything is super affordable oh man.   Not to salty and the beef in the P55 (a simplistic pho) well done beef and rice noodle soup was not to fatty and there was enough meat for the quantity of the soup. Was only $7!   Overall so yummy and worth coming back to try lots more stuff."}
{"text":"Fair warning: portions at Pho 99 are not big.  if you've a big appetite, you'll leave slightly disappointed because an XL size here is like a medium elsewhere.    Pho 99 is a small place that looks like it's been around forever (and in fact it has been around for as long as i can remember) and is a pretty authentic place.  There is little else in the plaza - a Baskin Robins and a Subway - and it's easily missed.  This place is never really busy, which is just as well because they only have one staff on the floor.  Typical pho restaurant decor (minimal with plastic table and steel chairs) and write-your-own-order forms.  I judge a bowl of pho by the soup and the soup is at least good here and very flavourful.  Unfortunately, as mentioned before, both the noodle and meat portion is pretty small.  For someone with a small appetite, it's perfect (though it's not priced any less).  In comparison, the appetizer sizes are a bit larger.  Fortunately for Pho 99, there aren't many competitors in the close vicinity, so i do end up here occasionally.  It's not my first choice, but it does the job when I crave pho."}
{"text":"Meh .... I've had better pho anywhere else in Markham ... and I live here so I know what comes in and out. This is the first and last time I will try Pho 99. I've always seen it at the plaza at Hwy 7 and McCowan, it's been there forever but I ever went to try it .. not sure why but now I know why I should have trusted my years of instinct.   Food is below average.  Service was okay.  Speed of food came quite fast.  Portions are very little compared to anywhere else.  Price is higher than most pho places around. Presentation was nothing spectacular. Creativity, none. Cleanliness, average.   I definitely will not come back. I'd go to Kitchen M next door or Congee Queen next next door or go further for pho than come back here. If i'm eating pho I want to eat affordable, and when it comes to pho it's hard to screw up. It can only be average good or amazing. I believe in I get what I pay for and if I'm paying more than what I would have at Pho 88 or whichever other pho place in Markham, I'd expect you to be better than just average.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, we came here because the place next door was full of people and we were starving.  I wished we had waited at the other place. First off, if anyone is going to this place, please take a whiff of the spoons...they smell like bleach.  It's not just a hint of bleach but a strong odour.  Secondly, there were virtually no difference in amount of content between a regular or large bowl of pho.  The only difference was the size of the actual bowls it came in.  I counted 4 very small slices of beef and 1 and a half beef balls.  I had to fish around for the beef tendon. The cold shrimp rolls...well it did have shrimp in it, but the peanut dipping sauce was definitely watered down.  I had better quality and pricing elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I desperately want to like, probably because it's so close to me, but they just don't measure up.  The quality of the pho fluctuates, I think based on shipments/supplies/time of day. The last time I went was on a Wednesday afternoon at 4:00 pm and it was a ghost town, so not exactly rush hour. The broth was watery/MSGy and the beef was just inexcusable. When I say inexcusable, I mean giving me cooked beef when I ordered rare beef. Ugh! If I wanted well-done beef I would've ordered the well-done brisket pho!  I also did not appreciate the fact that they charge, I think it was 50c, for condensed milk to add to the Vietnamese iced coffee. I mean come on, a can of Carnation milk costs 99c across the street at Foody Mart and you expect me to pay half that for a shot glass full? Just throw it in and I'll buy more from you. Simple. Plus, what's with this recent trend of standard pho prices skyrocketing? $7 for a S portion? Really? I'm almost immediately turned off by restaurants that sink to this level.  I don't know. I find usually the Chinese-owned pho places to be the worst but this place, though it's Vietnamese-owned, is reaching for that rainbow, lemme tell you.   Only giving 3 stars because they used to be somewhat decent in the past (ie. on weekends)."}
{"text":"Not the greatest. Just an average small pho restaurant. Server wasn't too friendly, the flavour was a tad bland and really salty and they don't accept visa. Only plus is that the food came out decently quick but I don't think I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Markham for pho! The pho noodles have good texture, immersed in a flavourful broth of beef stock, onions, green onions. The sprouts, lime, and mint definitely make a difference in giving it a fresh taste! The seafood pad thai is also an excellent choice, with shrimp and crab, in a light sauce with a strong peanut flavour. The spring rolls are also an excellent choice, fully stocked with pork, shrimp, fresh lettuce, and soft vermicelli noodles. The spring rolls are accompanied by a tasty hoisin and peanut sauce. I would advise, however, that upsizing a pho dish often equate to more noodles, rather than more beef, which is often a flaw in many restaurants. Overall, excellent quality Vietnamese cuisine with large portions at a fair price!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few time already,  but I don't think I'll be coming back again. The soup taste good, above average compare to other pho places in the area. But the portion is just way too small, and the meats that they give doesn't justify the price that they charged. Service is average at best, so won't be coming again unless all the other pho places close down in the area."}
{"text":"Pho is probably the finest if not the most prevalent Vietnamese food out there. Good Pho is tough to find especially where competition is fierce in Markham. Ideally I look for 3 things in Pho, Soup, Noodles, and Authenticity.  Soup - 4.5/5 Soup is pure and has the essence of pho here, worthy soup is the foundation of the whole bowl if this flops the rest is no good.  I generally finish the soup and leave nothing behind, great soup without the MSG after taste.   Noodles 5/5 - I really like the consistency of the noodles they use here it has much more texture to it compare to the average bland rice noodles found in most Chinese/Viet Pho.   Authenticity 4.5/5 - This place is actually run by Vietnamese folks, it has a good aroma that sort of gives you the feel that extra feeling you are visiting Vietnam.   Environment - 3.5/5 it's nice and cozy here when busy but can also be vacant at times the place is rather old but has a nice vibe, either way a good hot bowl of pho can warm you up.   Overall this is a very humble Vietnamese place that offers good food service at a good price!"}
{"text":"Summary: tiny pho spot is efficient (5 min from ordering to eating), and cheaper than restaurants in the same price, but is expensive compared to other pho restaurants  Top Must-Get: House Special Pho Top Regret: Watching the TV inside the restaurant  I've come here a couple of times for lunch now, and it has always struck me as a quick-eat place if you didn't want to go to Markville Mall's food court. When I was there for lunch on a weekday, there was just one other person eating.  $10.50 for an extra large house special pho is a bit higher than the classic Pho88 variant, and unfortunately it also has less meat, is smaller, and just doesn't taste as good.  The extra large house special has three tendon pieces (which is AWESOME - some places don't give any), several beef slices (rare and well; the latter ones were a bit rubbery, but that might be because I let them cook too long while trying to take pictures for YELP haha), some tripe (but not enough), and a couple of meatballs.  It's very simple fare - many other pho spots are getting fancy with eggs and fancy egg noodles, but this is very straightforward. The broth itself had an, uh, interestingly grungy taste. I didn't love it, nor did it fill me.  The pho came with a SINGLE slice of lime topping which is a bit stingy (most places give at least two or three), and some beansprouts.   The simple washrooms are surprisingly clean for a grubby place - and I mean grubby, because when you turn the washroom light on, the ventilation fan goes on too, and it's so rickety that you might imagine a demonic ghost is about to burst out.  Service is typical of a forlorn Asian restaurant. On the plus side, it has a television. On the down side, it plays the Food Network, and it's entirely possible that watching succulent pieces of steak being taste tested on the screen will make you disparage the overly-well beef slices you're trying to gnaw through."}
{"text":"Pretty obscure location but good viet food. Only had take out a couple times never stayed to dine. Satisfies my pho and com ba Mao cravings :) tip: must try their spring rolls!! Veggie or pork both are super yummy!"}
{"text":"Small simple restaurant. No decor. No greeting. You seat yourself. No expression on the owners. Spring rolls are bleah. Pho rice noodles...More noodles...Where the meat at??? $25 meal didn't really fill us up. We only came here because no one greeted us on the other side at Pho Quinn. Be warned."}
{"text":"This is a really decent, well-priced, family run pho restaurant. Their pho is hot, flavourful, and good value for the money. It's a no-frills dining room, but comfortable and always clean."}
{"text":"This is a small place which is across from Markville Mall. It's not a place that you will really notice because its not very noticeable.   A friend and her husband bought me here the other day for dinner. I was quite impressed because the soup base was pretty good. Most Viet restaurants nowadays just cheat on the soup base and just add like beef bullion to it.   The noodles are pretty good and slim. I'd like these rather than the slightly thicker ones. Portions are smaller than other Vietnamese places; I ordered the rare beef and there was only a few pieces in it. The prices are acceptable, not considerably cheap or expensive.    We also ordered the appetizer platter which was good. Good variety of appetizers which will fit 2-3 people only. If you had more people, it won't be enough.  Overall, I would come back again and grab a quick lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Went there once. Decent pho and rolls. Service is so so."}
{"text":"It's a fairly small size restaurant with just a couple tables, but I've never seen it busy so I guess you don't really have to worry about that. The food is standard Viet food and you can always expect the same quality, so if I'm looking for something to eat and I'm in the area and don't really want to fuss, this is a pretty good place to go. The prices are decent for what you're getting. Keep in mind that it's not going to be amazing flavourful viet food, but it's good and the same every time.  The restaurant seriously needs some update/upkeep. The interior is quiet out dated and looks like the place has been opened and unchanged for a decade or more. It's a bit depressing, but I just go for a quick, convenient meal and head out.  I've honestly only ever seen 2 people working here. One in the kitchen and the gentleman upfront. He's always quite nice and although he's quiet, he is fairly attentive to when someone needs something (tea, utensils, sauce, etc).    Like I said, it's a good place for a quick, convenient meal. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, pho is good and will satisfy your cravings. Tried their grilled pork and chicken rice as well, the meat was so juicy and flavorful. It's a family run business and the owner is very kind."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the east end of Markham. There's a decent amount of parking for a small restaurant in a plaza. The inside, while small can fit a decent amount of people and staff are quick and attentive. Very polite!   Ordered the P55 and made it an extra large. Well Done Beef Pho with Hoisin Sauce and it was pretty good. You really can't go wrong with pho but this really tasted like any normal pho place. Nothing special.  Tip: they deliver through SkipTheDishes as well! :) perfect for if you're sick in bed!  3/5"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place for Yelp before? I e been here a few times and can say this is exactly what you expect when visiting an old school pho place.  It's got that greasy slightly grimey feel and easy to view Vietnamese menu. perfect spot after shopping at Markville mall and guaranteed to have that fresh taste.   tables are sit anywhere and menu is pretty standard. sizing and pricing is between $7 something and $10 something. again the middle size is almost always going to be enough. so for $10 or so you'll be full and satisfied.  food  tasty, fresh, uses rice noodle. lots of meat and good tasting combo of everything. love that even in the suburbs this place is hidden away in a strip mall style plaza outside the mall. right beside Baskin Robbins. worth the short walk.  heck if you're getting your car fixed on Heritage or Bullock even walk over."}
{"text":"The food here was decent. Not wow. The interior is beyond out dated. The workers are quick but not very friendly. Ordered the vermicilli (bun) with grilled beef. Food tasted ok. Average viet resto here. But the place just looks a bit too run down, especially when its steps away from Pho Quinn. I would only come back if Pho Quinn was too packed. 3 ***"}
{"text":"Pho 99 is definitely an authentic and old fashioned Vietnamese restaurant.  Both the store front and interior decoration are unassuming and no frill.  It reminds me of the stores in the 1980's.  I ordered a pho with raw beef and cooked beef tendon (large $8).  The pho came out piping hot.  The noodle was thin, well cooked and well portioned.  There was too little beef and tendon.  The beef was basically cooked instead of raw.  The broth was okay: it was clear but it didn't taste very rich.  I didn't taste any MSG in it, which was good.    The part that I liked the most was the garnishments.  They gave me plenty - red chili, raw bean sprouts, fresh basil leaves.  There were fish sauce, chili sauce, soy sauce and white pepper on every table.  I broke the chili and the basil leaves up and put them in the soup.  I also put in lot of bean sprout.  The end product was a clear, fragrant and slightly spicy broth.  I really liked it, so much so that I drank most of the broth.  Services was average.  The table was clean."}
{"text":"If you go here and want to use A CARD FOR PAYMENT, be warned that they ONLY accept CHIP-ENABLED DEBIT CARDS WHICH REQUIRE A PIN. We are not from Canada, but I found this spot due to Yelp reviews. I was with Hubby and the Kids traveling back from Pac Mall, and we were all getting hungry so we thought we'd head here since it was so close. The place is absolutely no frills, looks like a typical take-out join from the 90's: Linoleum counters and tables with a slight \"film\" on them that ya can't rub off. Spoons and chopsticks out in the open, next to the bottles of spicy and savory condiments. From the get-go, we asked our waiter (a young gentleman who, I overheard... , might be the owner/chef's grandson?) if they accepted card. He said: yes, as long as it's debit. Not a problem, we thought.  We ordered the Beef brisket&tendon Pho, porkchop noodles, along with the sugar cane shrimp (all of which are Viet take out staples). It was good and filled our bellies, but nothing spectacular. The bill for us 4 was only $32. The kid also seemed nervous as he tried to carry our order on a large tray from the kitchen to our table Then came to trying to pay the bill. We had just enough cash to cover the bill, but barely a bit more to pay tip. As soon as my hubby tried to run his debit card, he was THEN told it was chip-enabled cards ONLY. We tried running a number of cards with chips in them, but all to no avail. Not a bad place, but a no-frills plain Jane kind of \"dive\". At least the bathroom was clean!"}
{"text":"Grabbed an extra large bowl of pho with rare beef and tripe. The bowl was definitely big but the food portion is more like a medium to me. I always go for the extra large when ordering pho and it usually puts me out cold by the time I finish, but here at Pho99 its a different story. I was still not 100% full. The portion of beef and tripe were miniscule. I couldn't believe how little meat there was in this extra large bowl of pho.    The spring rolls were just as bad in my opinion. Its suppose to be filled with pork and shrimp but it tasted more like a veggie spring roll to me.   Both items came to $15.55 after tax."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the opening of Toro Sushi I wouldn't have even noticed this place. It's so small, and if I didn't look at the photos I would've thought it's some take out shack and would have no interest in visiting.  What enticed me to trying this place is the fact I noticed it's been in existence for over 10 years. I mean, something has to keep this place alive, right? Something has to be good? Nevertheless, I'll find out.  I had the beef brisket noodle soup with what reminded me of the typical tomato soup base you see in other Pho restaurants (though it wasn't stated). I also had the pork strip rice paper roll and an iced lime soda. The noodle was your typical Pho noodle, thin and chewy, and the beef brisket was very good! The broth seemed to be the standard Pho soup base with a sauce added to it...ah well. The pork strip rice paper roll was decent, quite large in size. I didn't really feel that much pork in it, nor the vermicelli. A lot of peanuts and veggies though. Finally, the iced lime soda was quite good if you're not a fan of sugary drinks. It's VERY sour, I warn you.  Will I come back? It definitely has its own character, different from my usual Vietnamese noodle place (Kim Po). I would come back for standard Pho, but not for the exotic stuff I'm used to in Kim Po."}
{"text":"The pho is generous on the noodles and soup here! My family and I had a dinner here on a beautiful summer night. My folks adore the home and garden store next door to this place. I will order a beef brisket noodle soup next time. Atmosphere gives it an extra star, the table, furniture, decor and lighting are much less casual than pho eateries in Cleveland. You can see the kitchen from sitting on one side and the soup stock is old fashioned style made in there."}
{"text":"ordered a pho, a goi coun and rice plate with my date, it was the most miserable looking vietnamese food i've ever seen after one bite we paid for the bill and never came back here.  the food is just awful"}
{"text":"We got the grilled pork and chicken with rice that came with spring rolls,vegetable pad thai with the fresh shrimp/grilled chicken rolls and avocado milkshake. Food was definitely above average. Service could have been a little bit friendlier. Will not make it a point to go back but if I am around the area and was craving pho and pad thai will wander in...."}
{"text":"Simple quick meal and tasty! Friendly staff to! Will be back for sure. Soup and noodles are all very good"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for probably three years. I'm not a regular, but perhaps I should be. It is located across from Markville shopping mall (I still can't say CF Markville... baby steps by typing it out first).  The first time I went in and had pho, I thought it was okay. I wasn't a seasoned pho eater then. I used to avoid squeezing lime in my soup. I now do it religiously and it makes the soup base even better than it is on its own.   I order the large-sized pho. You get a generous serving. I am a bean sprouts whore, so the volume is perfect for me, as is the mint.   I have a bit of a sore throat, so I had the shrimp on a sugar cane as an appetizer. I gnawed on the sugar cane. The sweet juice felt nice against my throat. Hot soup and sugar cane do miracles. I actually feel better.   It was the busiest I have ever seen at this restaurant, probably because it's Christmas eve and getting your shopping done works up the appetite!   Staff here are always friendly to me. You get free tea, which is great. The food is good and served fast. It's a decent place to have a quick, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Alright pho place - soup base was only ok, they cheap out on the beef balls & meat that's for sure.. BEst & recommended dish there : the short ribs rice. Wouldn't return for any other dish."}
{"text":"This is a tiny Vietnamese restaurant that is tucked in a small strip mall across from Markville Mall.  This place is runned by Vietnamese/Chinese.. because they all speak vietnamese within themselves..  I dropped by for their all day combo - spring roll/salad/small special beef noodle for $6.99.  The noodle soup in fact is quite good... The broth is clear with nice aroma. The noodles are really tiny cut..one of the tinest I have... The only complain I have is the rare beef is really really cook...  The spring roll is more a vegetarian version. The wrapping is more like those Cantonese  type. But the stuffing is good.. with a lot of yam..(ok just because I like yam...)   But  the salad is drowned in Kraft type Ceasar salad dressing.. (that is a little strange. I think they should use more vietnamese type dressing with fish/vinegarette based and it will be much better). If you do order this special, ask them to put the dressing on the side.....  This is a good place if you want to hop in for a quick lunch since there is not big crowds here as there are no daily lunch special.  CASH and Interac only!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because I was craving pho. Tried the house special pho and it was okay, could use more flavours. Everytime I come here I never have to wait for a table and food comes out QUICK. I was here chatting for 2.5 hours today and never felt pressure to leave :) Oh and you get huge noodle portions!! I read other reviews saying their size small is really small. Yes it comes in a really small bowl but you get a good amount of noodles... Well at least I did..."}
{"text":"I should've just listened to the Yelp reviews and ate somewhere else.   Having heard about the smaller portions here, I ordered a large (usually eat a small). Honestly, the size of their large is pretty much a small at other pho restaurants. I got the rare beef/tendon/tripe bowl, and it was severely lacking in all three of those. For some reason, the rare beef had this really awful flavour; it tasted as if it was going bad (I really hope it wasn't). Everything about this restaurant just lacked oomph, and there is literally nothing appealing enough about it that would make want to return."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks with 3 others. I got the chicken and pork with rice, two of them got the house special pho and the other one got a chicken and spring roll vermicelli noodle dish. My rice dish was not that good. The rice was dry and hard and the chicken was so overcooked that it was super dry and rubbery. The others said they were a bit disappointed with their meals too. Although the food came really fast, the portion was smaller than expected. The service was okay but there was only 3 tables total when we went. I am not sure I would return for the food."}
{"text":"Best pho in Markham.  I always order the rare beef pho and fresh Vietnamese spring rolls. Delicious, fresh, authentic.  Although it's in a plaza don't let that turn you off as should definetely try this place."}
