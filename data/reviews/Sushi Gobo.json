{"text":"Made an account just to write this review. I've been here a number of times and I'd say 50% of the time it's amazing, great value great food, great service... however the other 50% of the time it's TERRIBLE. I've ordered the same order on separate occasions (more than once) and I've received different combinations of ingredients in the maki rolls. The prices are decent for the amount of food you get but it's not worth the 50% risk of getting really low end sushi. The butter fish I got today had a piece of some black thing (looked like the intestines) in it and the tuna did not look fresh. Not to mention they forgot half my order after it was 15 minutes late AND as previously mentioned the half that they forgot was completely different from when I had ordered it last time.   I don't usually write reviews.. actually this is my first review but if you decide to come here, be prepared to be 50% disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place. I live in the area. This sushi restaurant is clean, with a subtle decor, never crowded. What I enjoy the most about this place is the selection of creative rolls they have. And you can order your rolls with natural wild brown rice. It's not mushy like other brown rice that I have tried. The chef is a perfectionist. All plates are played beautifully. This is a must try place!! The quality and service are fantastic."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time - we live right around the corner and popped in for a late Thursday night dinner.  Everything was great!  I had a sashimi combo which came with miso soup, salad and steamed rice.  The miso was flavourful and the dressing on the salad was amazing - an orange-ginger vinaigrette.  Delish.  The sashimi was fresh and tasty, especially the white fish (melt-in-your-mouth) and the salmon.    I also ordered an Ocean roll, which consisted of very simple flavours of avocado, cucumber, salmon, tuna and fish roe, expertly rolled in rice, seaweed, and sprinkled with black and white sesame seeds.    My fianc√© had the chicken teriyaki bento box and an appetizer called urajiro, a yummy tempura-fried shitake mushroom creation.  The chicken in the bento was simultaneously sweet and savory and incredibly tender.  So good!   All of the presentations were gorgeous: food was served on simple white plates with fresh leaf lettuce (no green plastic!) and shredded daikon, which I ate.    Service was fast and polite.  Prices were very reasonable.  Everything was clean, sanitary and organized.  Portions were generous and satisfying but not over-the-top.  There is a wide selection on the menu - something for everyone.  Being a native of Seattle, I have had a difficult time finding truly good sushi in land-locked Toronto.  But this understated little neighborhood spot met my standards of freshness and flavour!   We will definitely go back...  soon."}
{"text":"Great for take-out if you're in the area!  Prices are extremely reasonable, fish is always fresh, wasabi is spicy.  Fast take-out, usually just 20 minutes until your order is ready for pick-up, and you get 10% off if you go pick up."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last evening since it's location is within walking distance to my house. Unfortunately, since it is a new resto, they have not received their liquor licence. But lack of liquor has never stopped me from enjoying a good plate of sashimi. The menu has a good variety of treats but it was not over filled like some other sushi restaurants. The complementary miso soup was actually really good because it included the thin Japanese mushrooms. I ordered a standard plate of sashimi and the pieces were nice and big so I was happy. The decor was very subtle and comfortable. The place is small but the amount of windows added the illusion of more space. We were there around 6 PM and there was quite a bit of patrons there already. Our server was very nice but pretty inexperienced. This of course will get better with time and it didn't take away from the meal. Definitely happy that there is a sushi resto in the neighbourhood. They do take out too so the more fish the better!"}
{"text":"I go here because it is closer to me than the other sushi places in the Annex. The food is good and well priced, but it is by no means my favourite sushi place in the hood.  It is good because it is nearer to Christie, otherwise I'd stick to one of the other ones on Bloor which is slightly cheaper with better option, I found."}
{"text":"The food is good. The food isn't greasy or oily.   The sushi chef executes his rolls well.   The often offer a complementary miso soup, tea and sometimes a half dozen California rolls to get you started. Had the hamatchi, it was delicious and fresh and couple of the appetizers.  Overall the restaurant is small and cozy.  Due to its location its never overly crowded, but has regular customers.  The service is friendly.  The place is also clean.  Gobo isn't overly decorated in Japanese souvenirs.   They also do take out and you can pick up your on your way home if you phone in advance.  I'll return to this place again."}
{"text":"Always friendly, always fast, and always fresh. (And the prices are very reasonable, too.)  Now, should I tell others, and risk contributing to the demise of our neighbourhood's quiet little gem? Hmm..."}
{"text":"This was an okay sushi restaurant, there are better sushi places nearby though. The price was good though."}
{"text":"Had a quick bite here while meeting with a client in the area... The place was nice and food was decent.  The server kept on forgetting what we ordered so it was a bit frustrating.  The quality and food portions were good...  Prices were ok as well...   Will try them again if in the area and do a follow up review if they are better"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live a stone's throw from Sushi Gobo, have seen it a million times, and finally tried it this evening. Being from Vancouver, I have a hard time finding sushi that's as fresh as I'm used to (living on the coast...) but this place was pretty darn good.   I had the vegetable bento box (just to make it easy) and my partner had the veggie gyoza, an avocado roll, and a spicy tuna roll.   The rolls were beautiful, other yelpers are right: the chef is a skilled perfectionist and the plating is lovely. The tuna was fresh, as was the rice in the rolls, and the tofu in my box. The food was well priced, and it appears they have a number of well-priced lunch options available as well (good to know for the future).   All in all I'm very happy to have this place in the 'hood and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"For a sushi place in the middle of nowhere, this is some good eats!  The decor is modern and cool. The space is small but suits the area well. The prices are competitive with a la carte Sushi at $3-4.50 for two pieces, rolls at around $8 and Maki combos for $10-15 each.  The staff doesn't have the greatest English skills but that just seems to make things better. The waitress was cute, making sure our tea was full and was prompt in taking away our empty platters. I had the Sushi Haru combo (12 pieces) which I thought would be too much for me to finish in one seating. The portion though was perfect. When you add on the miso soup and the salad they include with the meal I was left satisfied."}
{"text":"If you're not too far away from this place, give Sushi Gobo a try.  Prices are really fair, quality is decent, and service is nice.  I've had their veggie bento box more than once.  And their tempura.    Good value for your buck, but don't expect gourmet variations.  ~~ baby friendly?  They like babies enough, there, but I don't remember seeing any high chairs (a few months ago).  ~~~ side note: I wish they had their menu posted online..."}
