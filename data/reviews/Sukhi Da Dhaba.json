{"text":"I was a true customer before . id always get the butter chicken ,rice, naan bread. At first it was always ready on time when we would call for pick up but the past 4 times we have been told it would be ready in 15 -20 mins and we have had to wait about 45- 1 hour ! It very annoying how they are always behind so for that reason we will not be returning."}
