{"text":"The boneless curry goat is bland and tasteless, it taste like it was cooked with boiling water. The portions are small in comparison to Ritz, then I realized they used a smaller container than other shops! I will go for the curry goat at Ritz next time.

{"text":"Had the boneless chicken roti yesterday. $9 with only two pieces of meat, but able to fill me up with the potatoes inside. Will not go again."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and got the boneless chicken roti.  It cost $9.60 and it was lousy.  It looked like it was rolled over with a rolling pin.  The chicken was skimpy and sparse and the potato filling was mashed, not chunky as you would expect.  There was no taste - very bland and mushy.  There was no substance to it.  Nex time I'll go to Kesington Mkt - they have the best Roti for the same price!  When you hold it your holding something of substance, not a french crepe."}
{"text":"My chicken roti was tasty, and big. The meat was juicy, well-cooked. I read on the sign that it's Halal meat. They have a selection of caribbean drinks as well. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.  All 3 times they were out of what I wanted.  The chicken roti is meh.  Not a fan of the mashed potatoes in the roti...it should be chunks of potatos."}
{"text":"Excellent food a true gem in Toronto. The lady behind counter is a sweetheart and made the meal even better by giving myself and my fiance some history of the food we were eating. I loved the Roti, cant wait to get some more."}
{"text":"Small quiet West Indian place featuring a friendly lady at the front serving food from a hot table.  I got the bone in curry goat with rice and peas, salad, and hot pepper sauce.  the food could've been hotter temperature wise but the goat was super tender and tasty and the rice and beans were nicely cooked.  The pepper sauce gave everything a nice kick.  She gave me a ton of goat meat so it was a nicely filling meal.  I would come again for sure."}
{"text":"Poor Coco got a bum rap from Connie three years ago and nobody has bothered to correct her.  The Trini lady at Coconut Grove made me a wonderful stewfish roti, and carefully packed it up for my trip to the airport.  She helped me figure out what would be tasty and easy to eat on the plane and was careful to make sure I was familiar with Trini hot sauce before she dosed it. The place was very clean. The customers were charming. Roti wrap was fresh and tasty.  Stewfish was a nice sea bass that had itself been lightly breaded and sauced. Potato, lentil and other nice things  made it a very good roti. People in the airport lounge looked at me enviously as I ate it.  Also, great selection of sweets and Carib beverages."}
{"text":"Got a boneless chicken roti. It was meh.  The roti itself is light, soft and thin - the fillings were boneless chicken in a gravy and potatoes. She put hot sauce on there and said it should be spicy.  The first two bites were spicy but hten it was just bland. It was a large roti but the blandness is what kept me from eating more of it. I stopped half way through our of sheer boredom.  The staff were very nice - the lady who made my roti reminded me of every West Indian I've ever come across - incredibly sweet and sassy."}
{"text":"Coconut Grove went thru an ownership change sometime back and since then the service and quality of food has improved dramatically.  Now having West Indian (Guyanese) owners the food is authentic Caribbean cuisine.  They make nice curry goat, stew fish and veggie dishes for the lunch hour and quite happy to accept take out orders either in person or in advance.  Unlike your typical roti shops,not much focus is on the finger foods like doubles, pholourie or aloo pie.  Its all about a reasonably priced meal that is packed with taste.  If you had a past bad experience, I enrage you to try it again.  The roti is still better than Ritz Caribbean or others in the areas.  If you want the ultimate try Lena's Curry Pot or Drupati they are two of the best Trini Roti shops in Toronto (and no offense to the many others).  Island Guy"}
{"text":"I was on a mission, I had only one desire. JERK CHICKEN!   I'll admit it I was in if for the Jerk Chicken, the it I am referring to is the 2012 Caribana festival in Toronto Canada.   I first sampled Coconut Grove in Harbour Front. I was seated at another restaurant when across the way I saw a sign that said Caribbean on it. I literally left the restaurant I was at to eat at Coconut Grove.   I felt as if the chicken was calling out to me.  I was introduced to Coconut Grove was not actually at one of those temporary kitchen out door deals that you see a festivals and what not.   The jerk was so good I  was talking out loud the whole time and praising the man or women who ever invented jerk spices.   This was grilled and spiced perfection on a bone, the spices were so spot on the meat was charred on the outside but juicy on the inside and hot and spicy with a nice kick! I like my chicken to fall away from the bone and I prefer the dark meat more flavor. I got a a jerk thigh and wing a side of cabbage and carrots and red beans and rice with ox tail gravy on every thing the total was little under $10.00. Festival prices.   I also went to Coconut Grove the very next day, this time I want to the restaurant location on Dundas which just so happened to be right around the corner from my hotel. Thank God I figured that out, before it was too late.   I mean how lucky can one girl be?  I had walked past the delicious gem of a restaurant no less than 20 times what a shame.   The shop appeared to be run by West Indian Women which I absolutely loved. Coconut Grove what they lack in ambiance they deliver in flavor."}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter is so sweet & generous with the food portions. The goat roti wrap was delicious!! ... And the pepper sauce is spicy but so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Was really craving a Jamaican patty on a dreary Friday afternoon, and not having enough time to run far, for the first time since I started working on the block in January, I wandered into coconut grove with a coworker.   Ambiance: 3/5. Definitely not a great place for a good date, or special occasion... crowded with the line up right through tables, and typically dingy late 80s/early 90s furniture with fluorescent lighting.    Honestly, I think for places like coconut grove, it's about the quality of food, and the efficiency.  Food: 3.5/5 Coworker got a vegetable roti; me: my Jamaican patty (beef, and spicy).  Patty [$1.75] was fine.. not special, served warm, not particularly flaky, and a little dense in some places. Filling was a little under-ratio'd to crust. And their spicy definitely isn't all that spicy... but flavourful non the less.  Tried a bit of the vegetable roti [$5.99]- great flavour, however a little chewy. A lot of people there seemed to be getting the goat, so I may try that one in the future.  Service: 2/5. Average speed, however, their execution is lacking, causing the cashier to come off her till to help with assembly of the roti... which, in turn, causes ebbs and flows to the line up. Also, the person behind me knew the cashier (perhaps he was a regular), so skipped ahead of us.   Coconut Grove really deserves a 3.5... I'd go back if I get a serious j-patty or roti craving while at work... but in the mean time, I'll continue to scour the area for another patty place."}
{"text":"I have lived on the street for two years and always passed this place. I finally decided to stop by for lunch.   Ordered the boneless chicken roti. It was fast and had decent sized portions. There was a woman complaining that hers was not properly cooked. Mine had a darker pink colour but it was definitely fully cooked.  I assume it is just from using dark meat. Nothing special to be honest but its cheap. Probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I am such a large fan for Caribbean food!!! I drool for it anytime I see it! Due to my wife's distinct infatuation in not trying new things, I rarely get to indulge!   However, being that I have been traveling to Toronto in the past few months for work and having to stay over! I have found this place around the corner from my hotel thanks to a friend!   Today I had the chicken Roti! Mmmmmmmmmmm! Nice, subtle flavors with a large Caribbean kick! When I saw the menu.... It was so difficult! Hope they save a seat for me when I come to town! Cause this is the place for me!  The ladies that are running this place are such nice people!   SO RECOMMEND! GO AND GET SOME!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a three star.  The food is tasty, not brilliantly incredible, but tasty and satisfying.  In particular, the curry goat is the best bet.  Have had better jerk chicken at the Jamaican places, i.e. Ritz, near College Street.  The patties here are always nice and fresh, crispy ... melt in your mouth.  Nice lady behind the counter."}
{"text":"Small little shop with authentic food!  The roti could've been better, but the boneless chicken curry was delicious!  Makes for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"If you look past the specious claim that it is Toronto's #1 roti shop, I will concede that Coconut Grove is A-OK. It's tucked between a strip of similarly pocket-sized eateries along Dundas west of Bay street. Inside you'll find a sassy lady shelling out loads of curried meats: oxtail, beef, goat, chicken and stewfish and you can them with rice or roti'd. All the meat is Halal.  I went with the stewfish roti and asked for it spicy. It definitely packed a punch. I thought it was pretty good, though I probably wouldn't go fish again. Prices are pretty reasonable but note there is a $0.25 charge for debit, so you might want to bring cash.  Obligatory Title Pun: They've got a GROVEY thing going on.  Menu Readability: I don't even remember one.  Need to mention: Or 10 rotis and get your 11th free.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm not even remotely sassy."}
