{"text":"After reading the two reviews posted on April 26, 2018, I will not visit this establishment. For a fancy restaurant, they should know that should be aware of the \"customer is always right\" policy. Maybe the restaurant's management live in their own bubble, thinking they are one of the best restaurants in downtown Montreal. Fine dine with rudeness...non mer?i beaucoup!   I guess rudeness was well done."}
{"text":"Newly arrived in Montreal, we were stumbling around trying to find a place to eat and have a snack. Popped into this place, not crowded on a weekday. We ordered a couple drinks, martinis, that were made very well.  Starving, we pondered the menu. We wanted something small, and not anything to break the bank. A Lamb burger for $18, not bad! It arrives, split for us - a nice touch. The burger itself was absolutely delicious, juicy and tender and perfectly made, and a nice size - not too large. What really struck me was the sort of tomato relish salad that came with it - are Canadian tomatoes really that much more delicious than their American counterparts? It seems they are.   Nice place, nice bartender, nice food - though we only has a small plate, I'd come back for that lamb burger any day!"}
{"text":"Want to order a $38 filet medium well, have it arrive well done, send it back, wait 20 minutes, and have the steak come out raw?   Then send the steak back (because that raw steak wasn't an accident) & tell them you don't want anything else... only to have the manager come rudely tell you that you will be paying for the steak?  Want to after all that have the head of a restaurant come to the table, tell you don't respect his profession, that if you can't afford a nice meal not to go out, and making a scene in front of your colleagues and the restaurant?  Then this is the place for you!   Never have I ever been disrespected more in my life and I'll be sure to share my experience far and wide. Absolutely unacceptable, disgusting behavior."}
