{"text":"Finally my own 'Kitchen Nightmare'. I found plastic in my pancake roll with beef. Pulling out the long plastic strand--which was in between the layers of the pancake--felt like pulling out an ingrown hair... disgusting. Who knows what else was rolled in there? This was just unforgettable and unforgivable. 

I really wanted to like The Red. The decor was modern and you order on a tablet which updates the price as you select your food. Even the pancake with beef tasted pretty decent until I noticed the white plastic sticking out of my food. They did take the item off my bill, but frankly, the meal was ruined as I questioned what could be lurking in my other dishes. 

Chinese restaurants often have a stigma of being unclean and having questionable quality standards. This doesn't have to be the case; there is no excuse to overlook hygiene in the kitchen. It saddens me greatly as what I experienced at The Red (and ironically this review) will further compound this negative impression on Chinese establishments. 

I personally will not return to The Red, but I hope the management team can improve cleanliness of the kitchen."}
{"text":"The restaurant seems to have trouble maintaining quality lately. The soup-dumpling is on permanent 2-for-1, but the pricing is really weird: you aren't allowed to get just the cheaper plain dumpling, but are forced to pick a more expensive variety and get the plain one 'for free'. Of the 5ish things we tried to order, 2 were unavailable because they were apparently not popular enough (lamb dishes). The ones we did get (spicy noodle and cold pork belly) had significantly changed since we were last here - the noodle barely had any peanut taste, just... Sort of soggy and spicy and oily. 

Unfortunately, this is no longer going to be our go-to Szechuan restaurant."}
{"text":"We, six of us, went for lunch. As a colleague suggested it as a good place to eat. It was good, quality food. Some portions were large. We shared a lot of our meals. It was worth the price. We tried about six different dishes. They were all good. I'll go back there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We swung by here to eat b/c my Mom told me they have a buy one get one free steam soup dumpling deal. The price for that is $5.50 for one order. Only allowed one per table (fyi)
- It was soupy, meat was uber tender, and the skin was a bit thick for my liking, BUT, I still enjoyed this.

Got the shrimp steam bun- OK

Fried Dumpling- OK

Pancake w/ Beef- OK

Fried Eel Rice- Not bad.

A. Veggie- Literally in chinese called 'A' choi. Nice veggie, but kind of pricey.

Service type is mind your own business until you need something then they come by. I believe their promo of the steam soup dumping is good still.

I may or may not come back b/c of distance."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Sichuan style cusine with a great atmosphere, then this is your spot.  As a Sichuan native, this was the best place I have had the fortune to discover for home town cooking since arriving in Canada 15 years ago.  I ordered the Kung Bao chicken dish along with a few of their signature cold dishes and was pleasantly surprised at the large portion size.   The price is on the higher end for a Chinese restaurant, but like the old saying goes, you get what you paid for.   Service is top-notch, the waitress was very friendly and helpful,  a nice change of scenery from the old grumpy servers at most Chinese resturants.   Overall, the Red offers a true authentic taste of Sichuan cusine, don't miss it if you are craving for that hometown flavor; or simply a fan of the Sichuan style.   That said, I saw plenty of light flavor dishes as well, there is more than enough variety for all to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is fine, especially the spicy fish. But the service there is really terrible, the man waitor always seems edgy!"}
{"text":"THE best Sichuan cuisine in Toronto. The stir fried spicy beef strips is one of my favourites. Good service (by Chinese standard) and great ambiance. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was very good, but taking away a star because two of our orders were mixed up. A pork dish we didn't order was delivered to our table and two pots of spicy boiled fish came instead of one pot + the spicy intestines, but that was cleared up right away. The intestines never came, though, which was disappointing. I'm taking away another star because the servers didn't seem too friendly, and also because one server was coughing a lot. Into HER HAND. And the she served us food. And she cut the food with scissor and touched the food with her hands and it was super gross. I really don't want to be eating around sick people. I thought she was going to cough up a lung or something. Ew. 

Service was a bit slow for Chinese restaurant standards. I guess I'm too used to waiting less than 10 min for half the dishes to arrive, but that's forgivable since this place is relatively new. 

Decor is nice and modern. Menu is appetizing and spice level is on point. I'm considering coming back here. I'm sure that coughing lady has recovered now."}
{"text":"The Red is amazing! Their food and atmosphere is amazing!

I go here pretty often when I eat out. The staple dishes that I order are the Spicy chicken, xiao long bao, and shredded potato. They all taste very good. The spicy chicken is my favourite. They fry the chicken in a way that makes it have a kind of smoky flavour. There is a good meat to fried part ratio. Their xiao long bao, or soup dumplings, are done better than some dim sum places and have a promotion buy one get one free. 
All the food at The Red is not overly oily, as some places can be, and they are not stingy with their food and meat amounts. 
The decor is modern with a pretty red geometric lighting down the middle of the restaurant, but the red colour  isn't harsh either. Waiters are friendly. Overall, The Red has delicious food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Came here with family many times as they all love the Dan Dan Myun. I didnt try it, but personally looked oily.

Review on following items:
Lamb with Beijing Sauce
Lamb with Green onion
Sweet Sour Pork

The lamb dishes were good flavourwise, but didn't feel like lamb? Meaning it was probably overly tenderized. Tasted more like the beef slices that you would get in beef and broccoli or something. Also, the \"sizzling\" plate wasnt sizzling so...

The s&s pork was good not radioactive red like some places. Pieces at the bottom were a bit soggy from the sauce pool but rest were pretty crisp. Pork inside is not all fat like some resteraunts, probably shoulder. Sauce a smidge too vinegary for my taste.

Pricewise it's in line with other chinese places, maybe a bit over. Lunch menu prices are awesome, can get combos for 6-8 dollars and other random dishes from 2.99.

Service a bit slow, about 15 minutes for food and then it all came at the same time so we were a bit overwhelmed and some of the food got cold because we couldnt eat fast enough.

Overall 3.5 stars but i can't give decimal so 4 stars."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been looking for a place with Sichuan fish soup and seems that we found it. The spiciness level was changed to our liking which was nice. The Shanghai noodles took me back to Shanghai and they tasted the way I remembered. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, other members of the staff were kind too. I saw in the menu that they serve Peking duck as well, and some neighboring tables ordered steamed fish. Maybe next time... Great food, great service, great atmosphere! We are definitely coming back! The only thing was, if I have to complain about something, that we would have preferred oolong tea over jasmine. But all in all, keep up with the fantastic work and you will have us as your loyal customers."}
{"text":"Service is usually good depending on who but I've never gotten bad service.
Price is good - not expensive 
Food is great but some dishes are a bit too spicy for me - love the buy one get one free steamed dumplings (xiao long bao) 
Place is clean and usually not crowded at all"}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan food. The cold beef and noodle and pickles are fabulous. However, the other dishes are just so so. The thing is you need to order the Right dishes here."}
{"text":"The service was super slow on a Sunday lunch. We ordered originally ordered 4 dishes but then they forgot to mention that on the weekend they charge extra 2 dollars on their lunch menu.  We canceled one of the dish hoping the rest of the order will come soon. We sat for 20 minutes with nothing but tea, tables that came after us had their food served already, we ask the head waiter and he said he went to the kitchen and asked and said that the food is coming out soon. We waited another 10 minutes to see an even later table that came after us had their food served. We grabbed our stuff and left. Super slow service while other ppl that came later had their food while we waited. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"My favourite Szechuan restaurant in toronto,very authentic.the service is good,all the dishes we ordered taste delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and I was quite impressed with the décor.  Service was excellent, as we got a complimentary hot and sour soup and wait staff were friendly and available, although the place felt a bit empty for lunch.

We went with the spicy beef rice noodles, spicy fish hot pot, a egg pancake appetizer, and a pancake and stir fried kidney dish.  The kidney dish was the biggest disappointment (too chewy), but the other dishes more than made up for it with enough spice and numbing Szechuan peppercorns to satisfy.  Egg pancakes were not spicy, but very well made, with a crisp outside, and a soft yet substantial interior.

Would come again with friends who can take the heat!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my mom to celebrate a dinner for the mid-autumn festival. You would think that this place is packed in such a special evening but it isn't. 

We ordered two appetizers that were cold dishes ... This transparent noodle and spicy beef slices. We also had fresh tilipia fish (not the fillet) which was steamed just right - that is why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. We ordered noodles with spicy braised beef and it did not come for over an hour an a half after following up on it 3 times, the waiter kept reassuring us that it would come in 10 minutes. 

Eventually we asked for the bill - they charged us for the noodle which we did not get until the bill arrived, the waiter hastily took the noodle away when he found out we asked for the bill without even apologizing on how late it came out, then proceeded to click his tongue. A separate waitress who totaled the bill for us just deducted the price of the beef noodle from the original total without including tax which was a $2 difference. Least to say I won't be returning to this place. 

The food was not spicy compared to other schezuan places and frankly you could get better quality service and food elsewhere for a better price."}
{"text":"The Red is a sichuan style restaurant specializing mostly in spicy food.  We've stopped by a few times for lunch, and they do have a decent lunch menu including soup, springrolls, a dish with rice. 

Ordering is done via an ipad, but service is otherwise very slow.  Depending on your choice of dish, I find that the meal can get very salty/spicy.  As we ordered a few lunch combos as a group, we found that the spicy taste is all too similar between their beef/chicken.  It's almost not worth ordering a few different dishes because it's disappointingly almost the same.

Quite filling as a meal, but you do leave feeling like you've consumed way too much salt/oil/spice."}
{"text":"I've been here more than 10x as this is my favourite Sichuan food place. It's even better than the food in Sichuan!!!! Their mapo tofu is the best that I've ever had anywhere in the world and their cold noodles are AMAZING (we always take the \"soup\" home and put some cooked noodles in - voila easy delicious meal). I bring friends/guests from China here and they always say it's authentic and delicious! 
Service is off/on but mostly on and no one visibly dawdling. 
Price is good for what you get."}
{"text":"Excellent food!
Garlic green beans are perhaps the best done here I've ever experienced. 
Their chicken wings are a perfect blend of salty garlic and spice. Plus are super cheap compared to most places!
We also usually order the ribs that come in a hot casserole dish. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Three stars for amazing food but less a couple of stars for 1) Chinese waitress who takes a while to hand us an iPad menu to order all our food (very nice - very hi tech) and the language is all in Chinese - we are quite obviously a family of Caucasians. Then laughed at us when we asked for the English version 2) all lunch prices we paid were $11 to $13 per item, certainly none of the great reasonable cheaper prices I saw mentioned on previous Yelp reviews - I wouldn't be at all surprised if they gave a special menu for the Round Eyes with much higher prices."}
{"text":"A really authentic Sichuan restaurant with very nice decor and decent service!  Having tried other restaurants in Toronto this one stands out for the flavours and ambiance.  Husband's family is from Sichuan and we have travelled there many times and this cooking is similar to the food over there however his family says its toned down a bit but good but for me it's the right spice.  They even have private rooms which remind me of restaurants in China.  Prices are decent too."}
{"text":"Great Sichuan food! Terrible service. Upon entering at 6pm, the male host was very disorganized at taking down numbers for people waiting for seats. Ended up waiting 1/2 hr for seating when he told us it'll be a few minutes.

Food however was very good but I continue to stress how disorganized the staff can be. Our waitress missed a dish completely and decided. Ordered Sesame pancakes (highly recommend), Dan Dan spicy noodles (recommended but super spicy...think: numbing spice) and the grilled beef sizzling plates. All the food was spicy and delicious, so if be prepared for spices...it is Sichuan after all.

Would recommend and would go again, despite quality of service. If you can tolerate that then hope you enjoy the food!!!"}
{"text":"After having a great lunch here, my family returned (with more people) for dinner. We ordered a number of dishes, including the shanghai fried noodles, xialongbao (which is still on special, buy one get one free), a hot and sour soup, a moo shu pork, a chicken dish, a cold noodle, a plate of veggies, and a pancake and beef wrap.

So first, the food: it was all delicious. The shanghai fried noodles and the moo shu pork absolutely stood out, very flavourable and made very well. The noodles were perfect, and unlike many places that do shanghai noodles, not oily at all! Big bonus in my book. The cold noodles were also very good, although I found it a bit spicy. The texture and flavour was great. 

Now for the service. The restaurant is run by primarily mandarin speaking waiters. My family speaks Cantonese, but my mom speaks some mandarin and she can usually get by. We flagged down one of the waiters (who seems like a manager, not sure) to ask a question about one of the dishes we ordered and the difference between that one and another dish, and he was extremely impatient with my mom, basically waving her off and repeating what she had asked in a very condescending tone. We later had to ask him for hot sauce and vinegar, and he was also just as impatient and made it seem like he had better things to do (the restaurant was mostly empty.) This left an extremely bad taste in our mouths, which is unfortunate because the food is good. The other waiters we interacted with were very nice and courteous, even with language barriers. 

Food and service go hand in hand. They really need to improve their customer service to be a standout restaurant in a plaza that is full of good options."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Another good JK recommendation. 

- I really liked the layout of the restaurant, the seating is well spaced and comfortable... kind of rare for many Asian restaurants. I was never \"bumped into\" the whole evening - bonus points.

- Staff were friendly and spoke perfect English to me (I'm not Asian.... obviously).

- Kudos for good fast service.

- My new favourite wonton soup for sure. Nice chicken flavoured broth with roughly 10 large home made dumplings. Excellent dumplings.

- The pumpkin and mixed mushroom dish was an easy standout for me - I enjoyed it with a side of steamed rice. Brought a smile to my face. The pumpkin tasted better the longer it sat absorbing the heat and sauce.

- Black bean beef ribs with peppers / onions served on a hot plate was also good but a little spicy. I would prefer the meat to be slightly more tender though. 

So many things I want to try on the large menu. I will return very soon. This is my kind of place...

{"text":"We really enjoyed The Red!

I'm by no means an expert on the cuisine, but this is the best Sichuan restaurant I've been to in the GTA. I found other Sichuan restaurants to be too oily, and while I enjoyed the food, I didn't feel great afterwards. I appreciated the fact that The Red's dishes were not overly oily given the type of dishes we ordered.

As others have mentioned, the decor is great! I love all the bright red light fixtures and the tile designs on the walls. The seating is also very comfortable.

The first dish we had was the fried green beans with ground pork. The beans were nice and crispy and the spices used on the pork had some great flavours. This was great, but the next meal really stole the show. We absolutely loved the \"house special\" stir fried pork with green chilis. Despite the menu noting it was a \"hot\" dish, the chilis were very mild. What was great was the tender and juicy strips of pork and the perfectly cooked veggies -- a very high quality stir fry.

They had a two-for-one deal on water mellon juice, and I'd also recommend this -- very refreshing.

The restaurant was busy on a Thursday night, but the service was still quite attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Food came out raw and it took forever"}
{"text":"I like spicy Chinese foods and we have tried many of the Indian Hakka Chinese cuisine where the South Asians like to frequent. We heard about the Sesuan cuisine being spicy and tried this place. Loved the food. I liked the concept of ordering using a tablet which eliminates errors. Food was good tasting and people are nice as well. Will go back again."}
{"text":"UPDATED Nov1.2017

Yay, they improved. No more non veggies items found in my vegetarian fried noodle. I ordered Veg buns tonight they are pretty good with all different mixed vegetarian fillings. Great choice . We got 10 % off cash paid take out. :)

We got a take out tonight. Always happy with their food quality. Tonight I had to express the flaw from the food we got. 
We ordered veggie fried rice, veggie fried Shanghai thick noodle and watery spicy fish. 

All tastes are great. But we were a little bit disappointed with Veggie fried noodle because we found a beef tiny lung piece in our veggie fried noodle....... ?????????????????????????????

We go there because they also accept Vicinity reward program."}
{"text":"Had Saturday lunch today at The Red. 
This visit was not planned. We were just in the area after getting my car serviced.

We were seated pretty quickly and handed an iPad for ordering. 

We ordered the set lunch combos that consisted of a main stir fry, soup and bowl of rice for $8.99 each. 

Food was flavourful and the portions were just right. Only complaint was when one combo was missing and almost everyone had finished their meal before we felt it necessary to remind the staff to check on that order. 

I'd return to try other items on the menu, but only if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Sunday night and boy was that a mistake. It was packed with people waiting. We ended up waiting for 40 minutes to get a table. When we did, it was a little bit small. We were a table for 5, but the table seated 4. We didn't want to wait so we just said that we would squish together. 

The menu on this was quite fantastic. We didn't have to wait for a waiter to take our orders because it was all on a tablet. It was great because we could see what we were ordering (not just read the English translation). That way, we knew what we were getting wand we weren't surprised by the food afterwards. 

The tablet will also take the order and send it to the kitchen. Once that is done, a waitress naturally comes by to pick up the tablet. 

The food itself was great. We especially liked the chicken. For those of you that are afraid of a little bit of spice, I wouldn't be able to help you. Almost all of our order was spicy. I would also highly recommend the boiled fish with chilli. That was great. 

The service was really slow. I know that it was packed, and that is why I only deducted 1 star. The good part was the manager kept walking around and addressed our concerns right away. When we told them that the food was too slow, he said he would take care of it, and within a couple of minutes, the food came out. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this place. Great food."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese, and I've been to enough Asian restaraunt a. I've been here twice. Service is so so. Food is so so. On the salty side. Very pricy among Asian food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years now. Came for dinner tonight. We are not very adventurous and seem to get the same dishes plus a new dish each time. At the moment, they have a special on steamed soup dumplings(seew lung bau). It's buy one portion and get one portion for free. They are large, juicy and really tasty. I would recommend them. We also ordered fish in chilli oil, stir fried lamb, tung choi, beef brisket soup noodles, fried pork dumplings, sichuan steamed belly pork and beef slices & tripe in spicy oil. All the dishes  taste really good but being Cantonese, I'm not sure if it's really proper and traditional Sichuan food. Nevertheless, it's a nice place to go for a spicy dinner."}
{"text":"I think I'm evolving! I never had an appreciation for spicy food and I stepped into this place feeling apprehensive and ready to visit McDonalds afterwards since I probably couldn't eat anything here. Szechuan is the notorious spicy area of Chinese cuisine where I'm pretty sure their region's motto is: \"Pile on the spice to save your life!\". Surprisingly, I left happy, full, and not on fire. 

Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday. We were given the corner room provided that we reach the minimum spend of $300. No problem with almost 20 people right? We only JUST reached the minimum after a lot of contemplating, double orders, and alcohol. That really speaks to the great prices here. We ordered a lot of food so I'm just gonna do my best to list my favourites: 

Non-Spicy: Crab Meat Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai dumplings), Crispy Eel Fried Rice, Cumin Lamb. Can't go wrong with any of these. Xiao Long Bao are juicy morsels of delicious meaty bites. The rice had lots of delicious eel that was tossed together in a flavourful fried rice bonanza. Cumin Lamb involved super well-seasoned lamb pieces that really absorbed all the flavour from the wok it was cooked in. 

Spicy: Spicy Boiled Sliced Beef, Spicy Cold Noodles, Stir Fried Chicken with Red Chili. The beef had a really cool \"mala\" or numbingly spicy sensation. The noodles were tasty and very garlicky. The chicken was in some sort of flavourful spicy sauce that elevated it to another level. 

If you're like me and can't bear spicy food, The Red is a good gateway into it. You can really taste the garlic and peppers that go into making these dishes actually delicious, and not just painful. It could possibly mean that they dulled down the spice and aren't as \"authentic\", but it's perfect for me. Maybe tomorrow, I'll try adding a smidgen of hot sauce to my lunch.

{"text":"Having lunch today and order dumpling and noodles. Taste pretty good and the service is pretty good. When they realized I speak Cantonese then they speak to me in Cantonese. Some restaurant waitress just kept blablabla and I do t understand a word. We will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and luckily our friend got there early around 6pm to get us a table for 6 so we didn't have to wait in the ridiculous line up around 7pm.  But as soon as you walk in, you can feel a 5C degree difference in temperature - there is zero air flow in the restaurant!! It was September and it feels like I'm in Asia while inside.  My newborn baby was overheated within 20min of sitting down, so we didn't get to taste any of the food our party ordered as we have to cool him down outside. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It took me a while to come here for food because the outlook of this restaurant and the market towards Sichuan styled food made me have the impression that the food was overall really spicy. THIS IS A MISCONCEPTION! The Red serves Shanghai styled food, many of which are not spicy at all.

The restaurant is very spacious with many large tables with beautiful decor inside. However the wait time for a table, and the wait time for food is REALLY long. The food here is ordered through an ipad - from the restaurant waiter or waitress. The prices were surprisingly decent (not too expensive) and the portion size is fairly large. 

The xiaolong bao may appear as though it's rather expensive, but it's actually buy one get one free - so for two crates of xiaolong bao, it is a fair cost, We got the Shanghai noodles, pea-shoots and fried rice, none of which were super oily as well, and tasted absolutely delicious! You can taste the wok-styled dishes really strongly with a nice and hot taste to it rich in flavours!

Definitely will come back for their lunch to try out their menu items!"}
{"text":"A restaurant called \"The Red\" screams #SPICYLIFE, but there are many non-spicy options in this Sichuan spot; a comfortable, upscale experience that is worth a try.

What I Liked: Green onion pancake
What I Didn't: Lamb onion rice was alright.
What I'd Get Next: More appetizers, they seem good! Apparently the Little Dragon Buns are a good deal. And probably something spicy.

You order on an iPad so that's pretty cool. Plenty of comfortable seating, and it looks very classy. 

GREEN ONION PANCAKE was the star. Yes, it's definitely on the oily side, but the crispy and crunch level was perfect.

LAMB ONION RICE was not spicy. Small portion size. Decent lamb flavour, but it leaned towards more saucy. The onion taste shone through more than the lamb, I think.

It's local, so I'll probably be back eventually when I'm looking to make my taste buds hop."}
{"text":"Today we stopped by for late lunch. WE MISS the cold noodle! It goes well with the cold dish of sliced beef and tripe (????) My girl loves the steamed buns with soup, as always! We ordered the steamed pork belly for her to go with rice, she probably tasted the dry Sichuan pepper so she wasn't interested. I like it though. The quality and quantity has been consistent. Will come back again. 

We loved the spicy food, but can't handle too spicy and oily ones. This place is a bit far for us, but it worth the time. We usually order dishes difficult to make at home: cold duck in Wild pepper & herbs, nice! Spicy cooked pork belly with green pepper (a very common dish to test the quality of the Sichuan restaurant), steamed beef in rice flour (it's for DH who doesn't like pork), eel fried rice,sweet & sour pork ribs in casserole, cold noodle in hot& sour sauce.

The pork ribs taste more like ????? it's sweet and cooked through, not the type of deep fried pork ribs coated with sweet & sour sauce, my son loves it, had 3 pieces! Must try!

The cold noodles taste great! I added it after our cold duck was served, and finished it with DH in 3-5 minutes! Then we ordered one more and again finished it in 5 minutes. With a glass of cold soya milk, heavenly! ;) slightly overdressed with sauce but yum!

Then after the cold noodle, I was done...:D

It's our first visit, a solid 4- star.

=============================
We went back twice, some tips:

Don't order cold noodle if you check in very early for lunch, it tasted quite cold & rough, not as chewy as we ordered it later around dinner time. Probably it's left over/ made the day before? But I still recommend it cuz it's just delicious most of the time;

The grilled fish pot is way too salty; mane ask them to be easy on the seasoning;

The fried whole fish with sweet & sour sauce and pine nuts taste good and looks quite festive! Try to finish it when it's hot. No need to take the leftover away, it tastes oily and smelly if microwaved."}
{"text":"If you are looking to try a new authentic Sichuan restaurant in Markham, this is the place to be! For all the spicy food lovers out there who think that they can handle the heat, you must come and try some of their spicy dishes. You will definitely not be disappointed!

I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. We ordered the following items:
1024. Cold Spicy Duck Tongue 
1071. Spicy Boiled Sliced Tilapia
1150. Snow pea shoots (garlic)
1208. Cold noodles in Hot & Sour sauce

The spicy boiled sliced tilapia was my favourite dish. This is a traditional Sichuan dish, so if you want to experience some authentic Sichuan cuisine, this is a must-try item. However, be sure to check with them about the price of this dish before ordering it, because they sell the tilapia by pound. 

Overall, everything tasted great. The service was fairly fast, but keep in mind that this was on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was only 60% full. I've come here on a Friday night before, and I ended up leaving before being seated because the line was way too long. Therefore, be patient when you come here on a busy night, because the food is promised to be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent service with this restaurant.  The food here wasn't truly to my liking (since I was a part of a group, it's majority rules) but was tasty in general.  Once again, like other places I have been to in the past, I will emphasize one thing if planning on dining on a Friday or weekend evening...GO EARLY!!!  You should arrive there just prior to 6 PM.  Parking within their lot is limited.  When we were leaving at around 7+ PM, vehicles were circling us like great white sharks in the ocean, awaiting for us to leave."}
{"text":"It's a Shanghai / Sichuan style restaurant with a number of options even for those who stay away from spicy foods. The store itself is large with plenty of seating and some private rooms off to the side. There's a few televisions, but they only show photos of their food. You order on an iPad and I was definitely super appreciative that all their menu items had photos with them! 

Their \"xiao lung bao\" were buy 1 get 1 free, so when you placed one order (6 buns), you automatically got another 6 (another order) for free, which was definitely a nice! Prices are definitely competitive with other Shanghai style restaurants. Their portions are on the larger side, but the quality of ingredients and cooking was a bit subpar. Their food tended to be quite oily and were mainly made up of carbs rather than actual veges or meat. Staff members were extremely helpful and attentive and overall, it was a generally positive experience. I'll probably be back if I'm really craving some Shanghai food or want a quick and simple meal, but otherwise, given the quality of food, it won't be a place I frequent."}
{"text":"Wow this place is hot! If you in for spicy food, this is the place. The Red means it's red-hot spicy!

This place is not really hidden, but definitely overshadowed in this suburban strip mall. But this place should not be discounted, it's provides enough heat to blow you off our seat.

Specializing in Sichaun-style food, you will assuredly get dishes that are marinated in chili oii.

First we tried this cold spicy noodle which is quite nice, the noodle itself is clear and actually isn't as spicy as thought.
Also tried this combo appetizer that has three things on it: braised beef, jellyfish and some pickled radishes. The beef and jelly fish are great and had so much flavor to them. I really liked this and is definitely a must.

And then I got this tofu/fish pot that was super spicy, you could see it coming from my face.

About the service though, I think they could have used another waitress as on a Saturday night it was full. She hardly had enough time to serve all dishes and field requests for water or extra napkins to counter the heat coming from the food.

Overall, good food, could be better service."}
{"text":"Had the szechuan style beef & noodle and soup buns. The szechuan noodle was super spicy that I didnt even finish it. The beef was really good beef stripes (as opposed to slices). For soup buns you can buy 1 get 1 free, which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"First impression of the place was quite nice. Modern Decor and Red ambiance with Red Panels on the ceiling to match their restaurant name, \"The Red\". We ordered 6 dishes in total for a party of 6 ppl. 

1. \"Couples' Lung Slices\" it's simply a spicy dish that consist of Beef Tongue, Beef Slices & Beef Tripe. The presentation of this dish wasn't that appealing. It really looked like it was just dumped onto a plate. But the taste was quite nice and it was full of spicy pepper oil at the bottom. But downfall was it didn't have enough tongue and tripe. 

2. Chicken & Corn Thick Soup. The soup was quite large for a large lol. Taste wise was not bad either. 

3. Pipa Style Tofu with Snow Pea Tips, Mushroom, Black Fungus, & Bamboo Shoots. Quite tasty I especially liked the tofu and greens. 

4. Vegetarian Spring Rolls. It was ok. But nothing special.

5. Crispy Rice Cake with Chicken Slices. The crispy rice cakes were quite tasty and the chicken was on too. I didn't mind this dish but not everyone enjoyed it :P

6. Duck Egg Deep Fried Shrimps. This was delicious but yet again. The presentation was lacking. Used a big dish for a small amount of shrimps. Again looked like it was just dumped onto the plate.

Overall the food was not bad. Would probably try it again and try more spicy dishes next time."}
{"text":"Looks nice on the outside. That was about it. As soon as I walked in, I prayed the food could redeem the cases of empty beer bottles piled up in the waiting area as well as the visible housekeeping items that were on display right on the bar counter. I felt iffy already. The decor was primarily red and dark with white table cloth. The table cloth was too small for our table and kept sliding around; it also had a lot of pilling. One could see that the exterior was trying to impart some class to the place. Upon entering, however, we felt lost already because there was no sign or person to greet us as all classy restaurants would have. We walked in further and just stood there. The waiting area was spacious but the space wasn't designed well. The bartender/cashier greeted us from behind the bar after another customer and entered us into his tablet.

Menu was on a tablet as well. Customers would order from it then press \"call server\" to finalize it. It said sit back and relax. Our server never came within a reasonable amount of wait time so we waved someone down and it happened to be him. We were not sure if assigned server meant anything because he hardly served us. Maybe it meant who would get the tips in the industry's pecking order.

The food was okay. Nothing really bad or especially memorable. The shanghai noodle was too greasy and had a slightly different but distinct flavor from other restaurants that served the same dish. Jellyfish was not cool. In fact, the serving temperature for that particular dish was too warm to me. It was the very, very amateurish service and the staff's lack of communication skills that I am compelled to review. Anybody can deliver food to tables without training. This place would and could prove this true with its random delivery order (soup and appetizer were not delivered first) and service attitude.

With every other restaurants, accompanying condiments would (and should) be brought out with the dish (e.g., dumplings with red vinegar). When I asked for some, the kitchen guy in a white shirt pointed at the girl in black who was bringing food to us at the same time. So I turned and was about to ask her but saw that her back was to me, so I said a little louder since the place was so loud, \"Excuse me, can I have some vinegar?\" She turned around, gestured with one finger, and said \"Just a minute!\" Then she walked away, turned around, and said, \"I will get it for you.\" I couldn't believe my ears! I go to a lot of restaurants but have never been told by a server to wait! The appropriate response should have been \"I will be right back. Is there anything else I can get you?\" Get this: It was two different people who brought condiments separately (i.e., one with a tray of three condiments and the other just a bottle of almost-used-up red vinegar). Unbelievable! If she was already looking for the vinegar because she overheard me asking the other guy, shouldn't she communicate that to the patron instead of walking away? The kitchen staff who brought food to our table didn't know where to put the food. I relocated it for him every time because it was put right in front of me. These dishes were meant to be shared. He put it there out of convenience. I had to tell him where to put one dish when it came in a hot pan. He obliged but leaned so far in that he had to put his elbow down on the table to support his own weight as if to say the plate was too heavy and I had just caused hardship to befall him. Really? There was one kitchen staff who kept wiping sweat from his forehead with his forearms on way back to kitchen. Was he sweating that much that it was literally dripping? Ummm....see paragraph above. By the way, the AC was not cool enough.

There was no attention to acoustics in the design of the restaurant. It was so loud in there. Don't stay too long or you'll suffer hearing loss. In general, the staff there gave us a sense of disconnection. They were just humping through a hard job and didn't really want to serve anybody. The impression was that they were serving us because they couldn't find a better job."}
{"text":"This is the best Sichuan food we had in Markham and I have tried lots before. Recommend the chuanbei liangfen(????)  the best I had!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't give 2 star reviews but I was just too disappointed with the experience at The Red. When first entering you can see they put great effort into making the place look nice. BUT looks can be deceiving. For an appetizer got the pork dumplings for $6.99. It had a nice sweet spicy sauce which made the dumplings more appetizing. The dumplings were also smooth and soft (4/5 stars). For the main got the braised beef with noodles ($8.50) and also another noodle which was fried with shrimps ($8.50). The braised beef was over cooked which made them tough and too chewy. The soup was also very bland so overall this dish gets (2/5 stars). The fried noodles were also bland in taste and came with very little shrimps. We couldn't finish the fried noodle dish so we asked to take it to go. Waitress took it to a back counter and packaged it but while she was doing this she was coughing like she was hacking out a lung or something. I couldn't see it happen since it was blocked off by a wall but I know what I heard. I was gonna eat the left overs for dinner but after what I had partly witnessed I had no choice but to throw it out."}
{"text":"The food is great! Trust me, the spicy food is not as spicy as it looks. They have lunch menu (available at the restaurant) and the prices are lower than their regular menu. Atmosphere is nice, spacious, comfy seating, kid friendly environment. Price is reasonable and portion is big. The Spring Onion & Dried Pork Pancake is very good!! The small Dandan Noodle in the lunch menu is only $3.99 - good deal!! The peanut taste is not strong, but it is not too spicy. Definitely worth trying. Service is good, would be much better if you speak Mandarin, but the servers speak English too. The reason why I give them 5 stars is because 
1) nice atmosphere, comfy seating (not many Chinese restaurants have this)
2) Food is great and portion is big (you don't usually get big portion in Chinese restaurant nowadays)
3) Price is reasonable. All items in the lunch menu are under $10. The noodle and rice items are between $6.99 and 8.99. Most appetizers are between $4-6.

Check out the menu on their website. They also have many non spicy items and Shanghai foods."}
{"text":"best spicy Chinese food in Toronto! So many choices so much food!!! Definitly my favourite Chinese restaurant here! And very nice service"}
{"text":"One of the best Sichuan restaurant i've been to. Everything we ordered tonight were delicious. Meat Xiao long bao are buy 1 get 1 free. Its exceptionally tasty. Leek dumplings are good. My Favorite is the stir fry lamb on sizzling plate, i always love lamb!!! The beef wrapped pancake is just ok. Beef noodle soup and stir fry shanghai noodle are very good too.

When i walked it I thought food must be expensive. But surprised that food is fairly priced. Ambience is really nice. Their menu is on an ipad which you only see at ayce restaurants. Comes in chinese and english version.

I would definitely will come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different so decided to try The Red...when I first heard if it I thought it was a communist hang out spot but turns out its a Sichuan style place instead; p

The menu ranges from spicy Sichuan style chili dishes to northern style noodles and dumplings.  The menu is ordered via a tablet but they only give one per table which is a bit annoying as only one person can see at a time but you see the entire final price when you order which is pretty cool.  

The food is for the most part pretty good with some stand outs being the General Tsao Chicken and the Shanghai Noodles, but then some serious fails such as the Stir Fried Chicken with Chilis and Peking Duck.

Service was nice but I find they are a bit forgetful when you ask for things.  Worst part was every single dish that was brought out, there were no serving spoons or utensils given.  We had to ask each and every time for one.  Never experience that before in a restaurant.

Overall a pretty good place but despite the setbacks we experienced we would probably come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Uncle is from Si Chuan and he said The Red is one of the most authentic Si Chuan restaurants in Markham. I've ordered take out from here couple times, and the quality has been very consistent. Decent portions and reasonable spiciness. It is not true that all Si Chuan food are spicy, it's like not all Japanese food has salmon in them. 

I love their ???? the most, a bit oily but tastes just like the ones in China. 

If you're doing take out, you can call ahead and pick up, or order there. The wait usually about 10-15 minutes depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Wonderful plentiful food,  authentic cooks,  great dishes.   What is not to love!   When in the area I will go again and again."}
{"text":"Food: 4*
Service: 3*
Washroom 2.5*
Parking: 3* 

**It's cash and debit only, at least in 2017 it is so come prepared! 

I will be back for more dishes to try, it's an easy place to find something for everyone here. We somehow did not order anything spicy, my mistake as I wanted to try a Sichuan spicy noodles then forgot to tap it. 

If you arrive here before 7pm for dinner it's easy to get a table and parking. There's lots of small 2 & 4 seater tables or really big group tables and one private back room. They were accommodating for kids, high chairs and IKEA plastic plates and cutlery which was a nice touch. 

Ordering is done via tablet, so easy to see food photos, prices and keep track but hard to share the menu! They don't offer normal menus for a group settings which is strange. Order is sent to kitchen like an email and verified by server, so you see the grand total and your whole order neatly. 

Great eel fried rice, plumps of eel lightly coated and deep fried amongst a bed of flavorful fried rice, my son didn't ask he just kept eating it. 
Dim sum menu is the northern style similar to Ding Tai Fung in first markham place. There's steamed buns, dumplings, xiao long baos, pan fried pancakes(try the radish), the foil wrapped pancake with beef is a must, but only 4 portions in an order. 

Next time, gotta order something with the sizzling hot plate of beef, it smelled so darn good as they wheeled it by on the cart. Or try the hot pot of stew on the table when it gets cold, smelled great and looked so hearty. 

Service was friendlier here than at most Asian restaurants, but still lacking compared to a western style place, only few staffed so they are rushing around. Little service touches are inconsistent so you gotta speak up, i.e.) everyone has a cup for tea, the tea pot once didn't make it to the table, serving utensils come with some plates but not all."}
{"text":"Pretty good Sichuan restaurant! Super RED and modern decor inside. Upon arrival,  we were seated promptly at a booth. Very comfortable seating. The wait staff were nice and our food came quickly. 

Must try: spring onion and dried pork pancake! 
I don't like onions of any type but it doesn't have a strong onion flavour. The dried pork was sandwiched between 2 layers of pancake covered in sesame seeds. Just simply delicious! 

It seems that they are currently some sort of a promotion where if you order the steamed buns stuffed with juicy pork and crab meat or shrimps, you get the regular one with just juicy pork for free. Super awesome deal! The buns are very juicy and make sure you don't burn yourself when you bite into it. There's steaming hot juice/condensation in these buns when they're fresh out of the steamer. 

We ordered 2 dishes that are on their main menu and not on the checklist form. One was a chicken with chili and the other was a vegetable dish called chef tofu snow pea tip (at least that's what it said on the receipt). The spicy chicken dish had bite-sized pieces of deep fried chicken with lots of red chili peppers. It's spicy but in a numbing sort of way and not the usual burn. Didn't try eating the chili peppers. As for the vegetable dish, it had an assortment of broccoli, mushrooms, black fungus, and tofu puffs. Really yummy and healthy! No complaints on everything we ordered (see pictures).

Overall, great experience. Will definitely return for the spring onion and dried pork pancake and also to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The Red serves Sichuan Cuisine, a province in southwestern China. The flavours are often bold and spicy with liberal use of aromatic ingredients like garlic and pungent ingredients like Sichuan peppers. While Sichuan (AKA Szechuan) is often synonymous with super spicy food, the dishes really have several distinct flavours, some of which are not spicy at all. The flavours are: hot, sour, sweet, pungent, and salty. Yes, salty on purpose, can you believe that?! There are also different levels of dishes to Sichuan food, ranging from food snacks to gourmet banquet dishes.
 
The Red is more on the lower end of the gourmet scale, covering snacks, household dishes, and popularized dishes. Located in Unionville, The Red is east of Markville Mall in a plaza with ample free parking. The decor is modern and the noise level was average. Embracing new tech, ordering is done via tablet like many of the Japanese Sushi AYCE places.

The Red served a huge array of dishes, but we were primarily there for the street meat! The snacks, small plates, or Chinese tapas if you will. They had no shortage of variety here, and their menu even had some dishes from Shanghai. On the menu for tonight was xi?olóng b?o (little dragon buns); beef rolled pancakes; Beijing (aka Peking) duck; sweet spare ribs in casserole; chicken wings with hot black bean sauce on sizzling hot plate; fried chicken wings; fried green bean with ground pork; Deep fried Chinese handmade buns; Sauteed beef with black pepper sauce on sizzling hot plate; gan guo chinese cabbage and pork; pan fried silver pancake; and puff pastry with filling.

There are a lot of plates, so I will be as brief as possible hitting only the major points of each.

Xiaolong bao. A Shanghai dish of steamed pork dumpling with soup inside each one. The truck to this dish is getting a really thin dumpling shell. The Red did a decent job, being better than most dim sum restaurants, but not quite as good as at Ding Tai Fung (First Markham Place). 3,5 stars.

Beef Rolled Pancakes. Another Shanghai dish, a thin crispy pancake with beef, and the rolled. Slightly salty, slightly sweet and greasy, the trifecta for comfort food. 4 stars.

Beijing Roasted Duck. A northern Chinese dish usually served as 2-3 dishes. The main is the duck skin and flesh served with soft flour wraps with cucumber onions, and Hoisin sauce. The second dish is usually a stir fried dish with the inner meat of the duck with vegetables. Lettuce is use as the wrap for this secondi. If there is a third dish it will be in the form of soup made with the bones and whatever meat they couldn't remove. Here at the Red, it was a two course Beijing Duck. The skin was crispy and the duck was not too fatty, the way I prefer, but not authentic (Authentic China ensures the duck is very fatty, and is not consumed very often) whereas here we tend to consume much more frequently so we've adapted the dish for the same of our health. 4 stars.

Deep fried handmade buns. These are made by pulling dough over and over to create thin strands, then shaped into a bun and deep fried. It's served with condensed milk. The bun was fine, the right consistency and texture. The condensed milk was very sparing and if now quality. 2 stars.

Sweet Spare Ribs. Served on a cast iron plate the ribs were not fall off the bone, but were moist and tender. 3,5 stars.

Sautéed beef on sizzling hot plate. A popular Chinese dish, it was on par with most restaurants. Onions, peppers, mushrooms, and beef stir fried with black bean sauce. Not a spicy dish, but flavourful. 4 stars.

Fried chicken wings. A small plate, I actually didn't get to try this as they were all gone before I had a chance. A favourite among the kids. Their review: 5 stars. But honestly, you can't really go wrong with fried chicken wings. The flavour would be my determining factor for the rating, but even a simple dusting it with garlic salt would suffice.

Fried green bean with ground pork. We were actually looking for long beans as that is normally the dish with Sichuan, but this place made it with green beans, not sure if it's due to availability, price, or just catering to the local crowd. The beans were slightly overcooked, and the dish not very spicy. 2 stars.

Chinese cabbage and pork. This was something I never had before. Ground pork, fungus, cabbage, and hot peppers stir fried. Similar to the second course of a Beijing duck where it's served with flour wraps. While the dish wasn't bad, I think it lacked depth when it came to flavours. There was also very little in the way of sauce, further depriving my taste buds. 2,5 stars.

The puff pastry. An egg based pastry that slightly resembles the texture of a French Cruller (which I love) and filled with red bean paste. It's topped with glazed and icing sugar. The dough was a little more moist than I prefer, but the taste was pretty good. 3,5 stars.

3,5 stars overall, rounded down to 3. I think they did a good job on the small plates, I'd stick to them."}
{"text":"I arrived late into the party so i didnt get a chance to order anything - it was my second dinner of night anyway so I was cool with whatever was ordered. 

The decor and ambiance of the place is pretty impressive, but the food seemed less so. The water cooked fish was full of little bones in the fish and the bottom of the dish was covered with yellow sprouts and no napa. The most disappoint part was that it wasn't even all that spicy. 

They offer soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) which is really weird for a Szechaun restaurant.

I've had better Szechuan food in less decorated restaurants - this place feels like a westernized version of szechuan food, lacking spice, numbess, intense flavour and saltiness, which disappointed me. 

3 stars because the food is decent and we didn't order too many szechuan dishes. If someone really wanted to come back, I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"This place has a whole lot of spicy dishes...
We actually ordered 3 dishes with no spice, but they were all too salty. If you ate it with rice, it would taste ok, but the fact that I didn't order it with rice in the beginning, the saltiness of the dishes kind of killed me. The spicy dish (lamb) had a pretty good favouring to it, which I liked, it was kind of oily though...
I really liked the \"xiao long Bao\", you must get those, soooo good. The area is pretty clean and the price was reasonable as well."}
{"text":"The Red is a Sichuan restaurant that opened less than a week in the plaza at the corner of McCowan and 7.

Impressive deco and even the entrance looks impressive. The interior is spacious with high ceiling and those red chandeliers just made me went Wow! 

Looking at the menu, there is a lot of similarity to Ba Shu Ren Jia and as matter of fact it is related.

We shared:

Cold Free Range Chicken with Spicy Sauce ($9.50)
Beef Ribs With Hot Black Bean Sauce on Sizzling Hot Plate ($12.99)
Fish Fillet with Potato Noodles in Hot & Sour Soup ($8.50)

All the dish were prepared with fresh and good ingredients and portion size was great for the price. But what lacking is the spiciness kick which is the style of Sichanese cuisine.

Waitrees told me that the kitchen did toned down the spice level a bit because of the clientele in the neighborhood. So if you really want to experience the essence of the dishes, you would need to request when ordering!

I will be back to try out other dishes. They do offers set lunch for $7.99 with appetitzers, soups, iced tea!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch. I've personally been to Sichaun, and ate at restaurants in Chengdu and Chongqing. This place is about as authentic as it can get in Markham, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a proper sichaun restaurant as good as this in Markham. We had the sliced beef/tendon/ox tongue cold app, sliced beef in hot oil pot, and short ribs (the stuff you can get in Sichaun). It was very good, but not as spicy as it could be. For a place called the Red, I'd expect A LOT more spice."}
{"text":"Love their spicy food. So many options to choose from. For all the meats they have various ways of making it. Price is really good. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Went with husband 2 days after they first opened. Decor of the restaurant suggested high priced menu but to our surprise the price per dish is very reasonable and good portion size. Flavour is a little on the light spicy end but you can always ask the kitchen to add more heat. 
 
We have been back a couple more times after and enjoyed every time."}
{"text":"I liked the dim sum the best, think it was pork dim sum. Had 3 different spicy food (pork, lamb, fish) and liked the fish the most, it has bean sprouts at the bottom. Red meat is not my fave but lamb was good I can say, lamb onion black fungus on hot plate. Also white jelly noodle with soy sauce was good - was better than the one I had at Asian legend. Steam rice was huge, shared with my aunt."}
{"text":"Normally I don't like to leave one star reviews but I think finding a bug in the food calls for a one star review. Service was alright as they removed the dish from our bill. Didn't offer a free replacement but whatever. Just be careful as some other people who came here also found interesting objects in their food (just read some of the other reviews)."}
