{"text":"We checked out the newly opened Playa Cabana - Cafeteria on Friday. We've been to other Playa Cabana locations before and have always had great experiences so very disappointed of how this one turned out. We ordered fish tacos, guac and chips, crab salad, tuna tostada, huarache de tinga and the chicken mole. last dish to come out was chicken mole which we were too stuffed to enjoy. We packed it up and were looking forward to enjoying out left overs for lunch. Lunch today was frightful - chicken was completely raw on the inside (also taking into account that it was heated up in the microwave). Completely put a damper on our otherwise good experience. Diner beware!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my last visit to this place that I signed up on Yelp just to write this review. This restaurant used to be one of my favourites in Toronto - great value for delicious food and excellent service. Doesn't seem like that is the case anymore, judging by my last visit on Friday. I hadn't been in a couple of months so I'm not sure if the management has changed or something, but the food was simply terrible. The fish tacos I got (both fried and grilled) were half the size they used to be, insanely salty and drenched in this awful ranch sauce. The guac was OK but the super-salty chips it came with were not nearly enough, and when we asked for a few more we were charged an extra $3 for a tiny bowl of chips. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"{this is drinks review only}

This restaurant has Del Maguey Mezcal. 

And they serve it in these terracotta \"shot bowls\" that are complete game changers and revolutionize the way you taste, enjoy and experience the mezcal. 

WHY DON'T OTHER PLACES DO THIS!! I think I am going to be that zero-waster who adds a terracotta shot bowls to her reusable containers roster.

Done and doner."}
{"text":"Nicest place on college west.Great food at reasonable prices.Friendly staff who know the menu.Comfortable surroundings without being rushed.Nice buzz with good crowd.Reserve a day ahead or be prepared to wait. Try the goat stew and the red rice . Smaller menu at lunch but still great.Will work around any allergies you may have willingly. Wine list is small and needs expanding but for a new place they are off to a great start.If you live in area try it out.STRONGLY recommend."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place with a great interior and overall environment. Just like their other locations under different names they have an amazing menu ! The staff were super friendly with out very large group of people. They explained the menu and suggested what to order to share based on what other customers really enjoyed. They also asked for feedback at the end on what they suggested we order. They were prompt with drinks and always ensured water was refilled. The places wasn't overly loud even though it was packed solid very fast. The food tasted fresh and the flavours eclectic. we had four people who are paleo dieters and they made sure to accommodate their dietary needs and their food looked just as good if not better. The desserts are also a must try ! I have been craving since I left and I don't think they do delivery or uber eats :( overall a must try! Reservations are suggested and they also have good Americanos and cocktails."}
{"text":"It's amazing how spot on some of these reviews are.  Upon coming into Cafeteria we were impressed by the decor but that's where it went downhill.  We were told that we might not be able to sit down despite and empty restaurant.  After declining not the bar we were seated at a picnic table that was mildly uncomfortable.

Our interactions with the main waitress were terse and she claimed she hadn't had anything on the menu.   When what looked like the manager delivered the food and we asked about ingredients he said he didn't know and didn't offer find out.  

The food was average to good.  The one caveat was we ordered the goat which comes with four tiny tortillas.  When we asked for a few more to finish of the dish we were charged $4 for four additional tortillas which seems excessive. 

We won't be coming here again, there are just to many other great restaurants nearby where the staff are actually happy you are there.

Oh and when we left the restaurant was still only 30% full..."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Cafeteria and the atmosphere was fantastic. I loved the interior of the restaurant even though it was small. The service was slow but the food was good. It was not the best Mexican food that I have had, but I would go again for the experience. I do want to try their original restaurant, Playa Cabana! I got the diablo taco that had shrimp and a beef kalbi taco. The shrimp taco was really good! The beef kalbi could have been more tender. The tacos cost $4-$5. The shrimp taco was really good!"}
{"text":"Disappointing night. I've always liked visiting other playa cabana locations, so when one opened in my neighborhood I was eager to try it. We were greeted by a less than friendly hostess who was very put out that we didn't have a reservation, however we were still immediately seated near the bar. We waited ten minutes and no one showed up to serve us, so we moved to another spot right at the bar. A bartender quickly served us- she was pleasant and the drinks were strong (you can't go wrong with a Margarita at any of their locations). We ordered four dishes- the guacamole (rather plain, comes with a few homemade looking and very thick chips), the venison tostada, the crab salad al pastor (just a bit of fried crab on a regular green salad really) and the chicken mole. They were all decent and a bit of a departure from other playa cabanas- you can see they are focusing on more of a homey, country approach to Mexican cooking. What didn't align with that were the tiny, tiny portions. Aside from the chicken mole which was about 4 nicely dressed and spiced drumsticks, the other 3 dishes were palm sized. The bill still hit the triple digits though, so we left feeling definitely unsatisfied with the value of the food. Our neighbors at the bar also put a damper on the experience- clearly they were investors in the restaurant or friends of the owner. They were drinking straight out of the restaurant's liquor bottles, harassing women, and loudly bragging about how much money they spend. Overall, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly and warm
Excellent food and attentive service.  
Inventive menu using fresh produce , attractively plated. Two thumbs up. Best new place on College.  
Good selection of imported beer and original cocktails. Try goat  and venison dishes, they're Great!!!
Reserve early."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 6 on a Saturday evening. The booth they had us at originally was a bit too small, they saw us struggle and moved us ahead a booth which was a little better. They should invest in some coat hangers as it was a very cold day and we had a lot of heavy jacket with no where to put them. When we inquired they ended up putting our coats on the inside of a staff area which was nice of them. They tried very hard to be accommodating. 

Decor: I love it! It's laid back and fun and I was definitely reminded of authentic Mexico. 

We ordered chips and guac for the table, one order was enough for 6 of us. We had a bit of guac left over but it was only because one of us was eating chips without the guacamole. The chips were nice and salty and the guac was not over seasoned so balanced very nicely. Exactly how it should be done! 

We all ordered 3 tacos each. The tacos are 4-5 dollars each. I checked out the menu online before coming and it had definitely been updated. The menu was overall cheaper than listed online so looks like they have dropped their prices to be a bit more reasonable. I think this was a smart move, 6 dollars for a single taco is a bit much, and it goes against the casual feel of the restaurant. It was busy and a bit chaotic, food runners brought out the tacos in whatever order they were ready, often they just asked us if any of us had a particular taco at the table and handed it to us if we said yes. So if you come when it's busy, remember what you ordered! It looked to us like they were training several new staff, and one server sheepishly admitted to us it was his first day after asking us if any of us ordered a Chicken Tinga taco several times (we didn't). We were served all our tacos except one and had to wait for that last taco for quite awhile. I thought the three tacos were satisfying, but if you have a really big appetite order a fourth (or an appetizer). 

I ordered the Tres Leches cake for dessert and it was soooo good! 

All in all it was a fun experience and I will be back for more tacos!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Reminds me of seven lives in Kensington because there's great flavour combinations. Though the filling is overflowing the taco it was hard to pick up! But I'm not complaining! 

We had the vegan ( cauliflower, beets, zucchini etc), steak & whitefish plus guacamole.because we got the 3 tacos we did get the beans & rice. I am wondering if they are trying to phase this out cause menu had no mention of it but my sister's menu did!

We didn't have a reservation so we ended up at the bar.  
Service is slow so if you're in a hurry this is not the place for you.
Even though we had no alcohol, they still took a long time to take our order.
Was $6 per taco I think.
Guacamole was nice and smooth. Chips a bit salty and thick. Still not a fan of those thick chips.
Would I go back? Absolutely.."}
{"text":"Guacamole and crisps are good, shrimp tacos were nice, didn't care for the octopus tacos because of the cheap BBQ sauce they put on it. The braised beef tacos are nice. Super friendly staff, cool eclectic decor in the back booths. Will return"}
{"text":"We only had drinks here. The margaritas were strong and delicious. The atmosphere was cheerful and laid back on a Sunday night, and the service was great. Would definitely come back to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the other Playa Cabana restaurants, but the servers here were really friendly and attentive. We came on Valentine's Day and appreciated that we weren't forced into a set menu. 

For drinks, my fiancé had the The Grove which was really strong on the mescal (if you like that nasty stuff)! I had the Chupacabra and the Agua Loca. The Chupacabra was deceiving with the pretty little flower and dainty glass. It was strong on the booze (I likey)! The Aqua Loca was really yummy and reminiscent of rum punch that you get on vacation, but weak on the booze (womp womp). 

As for the food, the guac was pretty standard. I like that they put a good amount of lime and it had a kick to it, but I'm a cilantro fiend and could've used more of that. The homemade tortillas were a bit salty, but delish. The Pulpo (octopus) ceviche was kind of skimpy on the octopus and pretty tangy. I think there was grapefruit in it? Crab Salad Pastor (soft shell crab) was one of my faves. We had some tuna tostada (forgot to take a pic). It was also heavy on the lime which I like. My fave dish was the Steak Tampiquena. It was tender with awesome flavour and whatever was underneath it was bomb! I think it was some kind of sautéed spinach with crack on top.

Our meal came to about $150 including tax and tip. All in all, service was great and food was decent. The portions are kind of on the small side. That or I'm just a beast because I was hungry later on."}
{"text":"Talk about cute and colourful decor!  I loved this place before the doors even opened.  Working just a few doors down I had been excited to try their menu out and check out the interior decor weeks before opening.

The food did not disappoint.  I have tried the steak, chicken, pork and fish tacos - fish and steak were my favs!  All were very authentic in flavour and toppings.  Even when you order tacos to go they make sure they include all the fixin's!  

I have only been here on lunch breaks, which is a limited menu, but I am looking forward to check it out for dinner one night and maybe even for a little happy hour margarita in the summer! :)  They have not only a huge tequila selection, but also some very unique and gorgeous bottles topping their bar area.

The Ceviche....AMAZING...A definite Must try!  And if you like guac... you will LOVE the portion size."}
{"text":"Everything I complained about before has been fixed. Food was always great, but they've worked out the service kinks and got rid of that damned picnic bench. Also simplified the menu a lot and for rid of all the confusing marketing BS about the origins of their masa, which really no one understood or cared about. 

I come here all the time and love the tacos, fish ceviche and Henderson's on tap. A really great neighborhood spot with great food and service."}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty but the portions were micro. They brought us some hot sauces to try as an app and we literally got 1 small chip each. One. Seemed pretty stingy. Anyway, the cocktails were very good but again, served in a bathroom cup-sized glass. 
Tacos were delicious but sooo small.
The bill, however, was not tiny for all that tiny food & drink. 
Nowhere near decent value for the money. I'll go to Tacos el Asador next time. You don't get the \"cool hip decor\" but the taste and price is right."}
{"text":"Nifty decor, pumping Spanish tunes, diner fun vibes. I bet the tacos are grand, but i was only there for a drink with friends. The draft beer was sub-par. It tasted off... not sure if the bar or brewery was at fault. Id stick to the mixed drinks and tacos. Would go back, but not for the draft."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. It's a cute place, great service - our waiter was nice and helpful, explaining the menu to us. On the day we went, it was hot with no A/C, so it was slightly uncomfortable. Tried a few dishes. Guacamole was fresh. Rest of the food was alright. 

Taste:  3/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Value for Money: 3/5
Would I come again: Would try other restaurants instead."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tacos and the service. I had the carnita and the pescado, they were both so delicious we ordered another round. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because even though the tacos were fantastic, they were definitely too oily. I fee like the fried cod could have been drained from the fryer for a bit longer before being served. Other than that, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service here. Our server really helped us pick the best dishes and cocktails. The food is great. More of a tapas style than I expected but the dishes are great to share. 
The roasted veggie enchiladas were a flavor party in my mouth. 
My only real complaint was that the portion sizes are small fir the price. Tiny margaritas."}
