{"text":"I love this restaurant and am so glad i finally found out about it which was through word-of-mouth, its truly a hidden gem in Unionville. Ive tried their burger, ice cream and fries.. it was all yummy, generous serving and for a affordable price! *$5.50 for a burger combo!* They take cash only btw, so please remember cause you do not want to miss out on their food and the full experience at Toogood pond :)"}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of Two Good Pond and it is not exactly a place you purposely go to for food.  They have a seating area that gives you a good view of the entire lake.    I came here for a soft service ice cream and there nothing to complain about.  They also serve the typical french fries, hot dogs, and poutine but I didn't try so I can't comment.    If you are looking for a place to eat then I suggest heading to Historic Unionville which is a short walk away.  This place is more for the views."}
{"text":"This abandoned hut in the Toogood pond park has finally been adopted and turned into a café. It's nice to have a café to stop at for a coffee, ice cream, snack or lunch.  I like their fries.  They are thick cut, golden brown, crispy and with skin on.  The burger is juicy and tender.  Great fast service."}
