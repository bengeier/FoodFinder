{"text":"I love this place. Now I don't have to go that far. The hot and sour soup is fantastic. Try the moo Shu pork. Everything is yummi."}
{"text":"Love this place for quick Asian food. The restaurant is very clean. The service is quick even when ordering for delivery. My favorite items on the menu are honey walnut shrimp, chow fun noodles, and a Thai tea with boba. I also occasionally order from the family specials, because you get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped here on our last night in Vegas for some badly needed grub. I scarfed down a delicious Naruto roll from the Japanese half of the joint, while and my sister took the eggplant tofu plate from the Chinese side of the restaurant. We both enjoyed the food, and it came at a great price to boot."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place and it will be the last. The sesame chicken had every part of the dark meat chicken grizzle and all. The fried rice had long pieces of dark meat which tasted terrible (we didn't eat it). I love egg rolls and can always eat them but not these. Big pieces of cabbage and some other stuff that was uncooked Took a bite and this big piece falls out not even packed inside the egg roll tight. It by far was the worse 40 dollars I spent . Panda Express beats them all over and that is saying something when franchise beats fresh cooked."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese. If you are from LA and been for dollar Chinese, this place is about the same. Th e service is always pleasant and ehen I order for puck up ut is always ready. My husband lives for the fried rice and the orange chicken leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had in a long time! Chicken taste foul, soup has no flavor and the delivery driver gypped me on my change! I'll never order here again! No stars if I could"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to eat at outside  my house.  I usually do not eat out, but when I do, it's China agogo.  They have reasonably priced food and the portions are large.  The cooks and customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I order China A Go Go to be delivered approx once a week since they have been opened here in Boulder City and not once Not Once! have we been disappointed. The food has always been good  and the delivery drivers always very nice and accommodating . On the occasions that there has been a misunderstanding with the order, they have always made it right and very quickly and with much courtesy."}
{"text":"The food is great. They just changed there menu and don't offer half-orders anymore. That is kinda a bummer, but the food is still worth the money. I typically get General Chicken and am never disappointed. Portion size is huge and always fresh."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese food. Very good service -- fast and efficient. Staff is really friendly! I loved the honey walnut shrimp and the cashew chicken. Fried donuts are awesome! If price is a bit lower, I'd put 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is your typical Chinese fast food. I didn't find them friendly at all. I ordered the shrimp chow funn. I asked for no brown sauce, and it came with brown sauce. The portion were chincy for something that cost $8. It tasted okay, nothing special.  I haven't been back since.  China A GoGo is a NO NO."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The location is convenient, everything was clean and the staff were friendly. We ordered take out and service was quick......Then we ate dinner. We had both Chinese and sushi and none of it was very good. As a matter of fact, my Hubbie (who is easy to please)didn't eat his entree and only ate the fried rice and appetizers. The rest of the food went in the trash. If you are craving Chinese food then you are better off at China Bistro down the street."}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food! The Black Dragon Roll is amazing. This place is close to our house and hardly ever busy."}
{"text":"Really like this place- good food, nice employees, and fast delivery! We have dined in several times and it's nothing fancy, but our waitress was super nice and we have had only good experiences here"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to order from this place for a while. I finally did and was extremely happy with my order. The egg rolls were really good and the NY style chicken chow mien was amazing. Veggies were plentiful and not overcooked. The hot mustard was in a cup and actually hot. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight !!! I have ordered delivery multiple times and never have I had a driver beg for a tip ! I would have tipped him if I was the one who answered the door but seeing as to how I was in the middle of something I had my roommate answer and he asked him for the tip and said if it wasn't paid on the card it has to be paid to him in cash . My boyfriend ended up giving him a tip and he still stood there waiting for more because \" He dropped drops off to us \" ! Never will this location get my business again . & to top it all off I didn't get what I originally ordered ."}
{"text":"They hook it up FAT (enough for 3 people ) for lunch special, $5.96. the taste is ok, ( deal with it , there is NO GOOD Chinese food here in Vegas, YOU gotta go to Los angels for the BOMB Chinese food)"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine until i found a medium length hair in my food and a short hair in my kids.  I didn't even call to complain because I didn't want to be offered more food. No thank you. I will have to pass next time."}
{"text":"We always stop here on our way home from Vegas. Excellent food and service! Avocado roll and egg rolls are my favorite. They are so kind and will make just about any sushi roll you want."}
{"text":"I do not understand the lousy reviews.  Really great food. Excellent over the phone order taking. Fast delivery.  The 'FAMILY DINNER B' is about $35.00, which I thought was pricy, until it was delivered...My boyfriend and I are three meals from this one order. The wonton soup is awesome.  I love the garlic shrimp and my man orders the sweet and sour chicken.  They have thrown in an extra egg roll or ? each time. Our new favorite."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of being in Hong Kong. The food is delicious. I really enjoy the pork chow mein and the lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Every single time my girlfriend and I come here the young gentleman (Cant remember his name but he works evenings and is young) that prepares our sushi at the sushi bar goes above and beyond to give great service and he prepares the sushi, nigiri, specialty rolls to perfection!! the rest of the staff is also amazing from the employees to the management!! finally a Sushi/ Chinese restaurant in Henderson and we love it!! Also a huge plus that they deliver!! not only that but they remembered us from the very first time we came in. Always greet us with a friendly smile and as we leave they all say good bye and see you soon!! very personable and my favorite place to eat in Henderson.."}
{"text":"I wish they would give us an option for 1/2 stars. I really give this China A GoGo location - 3 1/2 stars. We found this place by accident while helping my brother move from his apartment to his house. We were in charge of picking up food. That was 3 years ago. Since then we've been going to China A GoGo for our chinese-fast food cravings.   Okay so we don't frequently go out to eat. Only when we don't have anything else to eat at home OR we're sick of eating my cooking. =D  The reason why we keep going to China A GoGo is: 1) Very generous portions, especially when you order combos. 2) Variety of foods. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. They even serve Pad Thai. 3) Food is cooked to order and not placed on a warming dish. 4) Prices are pretty cheap. 5) It's nearby.  We prefer their food to Panda Express and the Grand China which is on the other side of Durango (and Warm Springs). I hear that the Henderson location is a lot better. We may have to take a trip there one day to see if it's true."}
{"text":"WORST Pad Thai I have ever had (why even offer it when it's this bad???). My mistake, straying from China Bistro but they were closed (it was Monday) and I was \"desperate.\"  The reason I don't give it one star is that my husband and I went there once before for lunch and thought the sushi was okay and the service was good. Can't really comment on the service for the Pad Thai since my husband called it in and picked it up."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! Soooo addictive! Try the ginger beef. I cannot get enough of it. And the soup is out of this world. Everyhting is amazing! And their proportions are totally generous. Omg! Get me the phone! :)))"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food. Great customer service, the food is always fresh and made to order on time.                                   Would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"If you are to lazy to go somewhere to get good Chinese food this place will do in a pinch. We only order when we are lounging home to lazy to go out.   Hot and sour soup is passable. Egg rolls are too thick and greasy. I'm not a fan of their pot stickers way too much dough.   Most dishes such as fried rice and lo mein are good. Just don't expect high quality beef dishes meat tends to be tough."}
{"text":"One of the best places out there to eat !! The staff is really really nice. The food is always fresh every single time and always tastes spectacular !! Everything about this place is good"}
{"text":"For 1st timers to this place. Generally rule of thumb for this place. The Chinese dishes are pretty good, Japanese is good, thai dishes are \"so-so\". Nothing here is terrible.  Gave China a go go 4 stars this time. 3 for availability. 1 for convenience. I ordered via yelp instead of calling in as I normally would. They were quick to update any questions with my order. Pretty cool ordering system. Fast, friendly, good service.  Regarding the todays food, regular rolls are as you'd expect nothing fancy, good for a sushi beginner (my 8 yr old). Specialty rolls are fair, but remember it's delivery sushi. Had the wor wonton soup today for the first time, good flavor, generous with the meats, dumpling wrapper was a bit gooey, but a solid 4 out of 5. Eggplant tofu consistently good, eggplant cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Great service, delivery was prompt and the food was delicious! We will differently will be or ding from them again and again! FIVE  stars all the way around ."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the staff is polite, the place is clean, and the food is good. Recommended!"}
{"text":"i come here a lot for their family dinners, it's a great price and a lot of food, plus its good. highly recommend!  update (9:54pm) : i order the family dinner with the sweet and sour chicken, got home and they gave me the sauce but not the chicken, when i drove back they were already closed."}
{"text":"First and last time I get food from here. I ordered the chicken fried rice and it was horrible, lots of undercooked peas and carrots and no egg or bean sprouts. Very little chicken as well. I find it very difficult to find good fried rice in town, being from the Midwest spoiled me as it was so good anywhere you'd buy it from."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone says this place is good I guess maybe if you go IN store.. I ordered today for some delivery at around 8 and everything I ordered tasted old and gross $60 worth of food for my family I got the family deal and it was less food than I was expecting... the orange chicken was cold and it tasted old the hot and sour wasn't sour at all nor was it hot it I'm not sure how to describe the taste but it wasn't good. Anyways I wouldn't recommend ordering delivery at all just don't do it. Or just go somewhere else that's better."}
{"text":"Bomb af made me want to go home and slap my momma ! Jk but one of the best authentic Chinese food I've ever had ! Panda Express who?????"}
{"text":"Food is great. Delivery guy is always pleasant and timely. Food is always hot. My favorite is the egg foo young. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We like the pot sticker, shrimp, low mein fried rice and the egg foo young. Great prices. Service is good."}
{"text":"Nasty to the bone. I know this kind of restaurant have people that are not necessary proficient in English but never had it so bad. The poor girls can hardly pronounce how are you. God bless her heart. I ordered the fried Rice. It was nasty. Dry and nasty. For the price the hardly give you any food. I'm sorry but Chinese food Is very well known by their portions. Never again. You can have my 12.00 I pay for freaking lunch."}
{"text":"Good menu, fair prices, fast service. Food is good and sushi is pretty darn good for take out."}
{"text":"Doubtful that I'll ever order take out and have it delivered from here again. Food is mediocre. Ordered take out last week and it took over 2 hours for the delivery guy to bring it. I spoke with the manager probably 7-8 times and each time they assured me they would be there in 10 mins. After everything was said and done they remade the food and gave me a partial discount. Definitely wasn't worth it!   I should also say, I live less than 1 mile from them...had I known it was going to be that much trouble I would've just went to pick it up myself."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean a bit small but sushi and food delicious they have an all you can eat option for $23.95 or you can order a la carte. Just be very patient it takes forever to get your sushi all other dishes come out quick sushi completely different story"}
{"text":"I haven't found a good chinese place until my friend recommended China a Go Go. I ordered for delivery and I was very impressed. My friend and I got quite a bit of food. We got pot stickers, orange chicken, lo mein, general tsao's, and peach boba tea. They told me it would take about 45-50 minutes. It took only 30 minutes or so. They also gave us donuts on the house! The boba tea was in a slush form. I was use to a pure liquid form, but this was very good as well! The food was a little pricey, but for the amount and quality I got, I am willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this restaurant off and on for about a year during my working hours. The delivery is normally in the 20-30 minute range which is good, and the food is good and reasonably priced. The reason I'm rating 3 stars and not 4 however, is because every time I order some  china a Gogo I have to a Gogo to the bathroom, ALOT."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese/American type restaurant. Beef broccoli w/rice was very good, wife liked the honey walnut shrimp alot. Chicken lo-mein, very good. Hot and sour soup was pretty good. I have been here many times and it does not disappoint. The prices are right and you get a ton of food! I went on Sunday and they triple bagged the food which I think was about 15lbs! You will get your monies worth. Service was fast as usual and the food was hot and fresh. Nice people, will go back again."}
{"text":"Just moved here. Lived in Philly previously where Chinese and Japanese food was good in several different places. Then moved to Florida where everywhere I went was terrible. However, since coming to Vegas/Henderson a month ago I have eaten here 4 times already, and yeah it's that good. Plus the service is awesome and the all u can eat sushi was outstanding. I'll be back soon. I recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"Lunch Special with fresh vegetables instead of rice and chow mein is a great option. SO GOOD. Nice to have a place with a good value in Boulder City. No more Panda Express. I look forward to trying some else next time."}
{"text":"Chow Fun Noodle was amazing. I had it delivered to my door. They were very quick. I was very impressed. I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food I ordered, NOT only that , from the gentleman that took my order to the nicest delivery man it was awesome all the way around!! I most definitely will order again and tell all my friends about how great the food and service was!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try it when we heard they were opening here, but was so disappointed when we did. We had Orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup, and Fried Rice. I try to support any new business that opens here, because it's such a small town, but one visit was enough for me. Neither me or the kids even finished our meals, they were so bad. I hope that it was early opening jitters and they get drastically better, but unless they do, we're sticking with China Bistro."}
{"text":"Love the food! The employees always remember me and know my special requests. Great place for take out!!!! Never been let down and come here often."}
{"text":"Ok.  I have been to China-a-go-go about 7 times.  Now it's time to review it.  I can honestly say we have not had a single dish here that wasn't at least 4 stars.  Everything has been superb.  Small restaurant with a sushi bar.  They offer both Chinese and Japanese lunch specials until 3pm.  They are also now offering all you can eat sushi for $23.95.  Great food.   Excellent staff.  Reasonable prices.  How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Horrible... Have tried to give the place a chance several times because it is close and tonight was the final straw!! People were waiting for over 1/2 hr for their \"To go\" orders only to find out that it was sitting on the counter and no one had bothered to tell anyone... Then had to wait again for them to re-do the order!! New customers got their food immediately...and then only \"oh I'm sorry\" from the front counter staff...while cooks laughed.....the place gets dirtier and has worse service each time we go...wth never again, don't even want to give them 1/2 star...will drive farther to get better food and service!!"}
{"text":"Good hole-the-wall Chinese. Ordered pickup since delivery took waaaaay to long the first time. Those at the restaurant were very friendly and quick. I will definitely be going back when I need take out."}
{"text":"worse place ever .! ripped me off  ordered food and they charged me 50$ and forgot half my food when they delivered and said i never ordered the food i was missing . fuck them"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious Chinese food! Got the family meal for two of us and were only able to eat about half of it.... Lunch tomorrow! Eat in or take out. Large menu, lots of choices. As good as any food I've had."}
{"text":"This is the go to place when we feel like Chinese food and we almost always eat here for lunch cuz the Chinese food always comes out hot and fresh it taste so good and authentic, cooks are Chinese!!! I luv the rice w/ spicy Mongolian beef!!!! Thai ice tea so good!!! Pretty much good fast food Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Ate here the other night, service was decent. For an app I tried the butterfly shrimp which was pretty good. Had their chow mein for my main course and it was just alright. Not the best, but not too bad. I'll try again next time and see if I can update this review."}
{"text":"Overall impression:  It's a little better than ok.  First of all it's a fast food type of restaurant but a step up from Panda Express.  This was my first time eating food from this place but all I wanted was sushi (take-out) to satisfy the craving.  My wife and I have a favorite place for sushi (Island Sushi) but it's on Eastern just south of the 215 and I wasn't about to drive out there.  China a Go Go was closer so why not try them out?  Upon walking in I was greeted by about 3 of their staff all smiling at me, looking eager to have something to do... that made me feel a little weird.  Could business be that slow and were they desperate for my business?  It was mother's day so it could have been unusually slow and this location just opened not too long ago too.  Anyways I was committed to trying their sushi because the craving was strong.  After that weird feeling entrance/greeting, the guy at the reception was very helpful with answering my questions.  They were also patient with me as I sat at a table looking through the menu to order my take out...  even though I thought they looked really eager to help me, they did not hover over me which I think gives them points.  Their selection of specialty rolls was ok... again not as many varieties as Island Sushi.  In my opinion there were too many that had cream cheese as an ingredient.  yuck.  So I ordered a few specialty rolls (mostly spicy!) and they redeemed a coupon for a free CA roll.  I wanted to try some Chow Fun or some Pork Fried Rice a la carte, but the prices really turned me off.  Chow Fun for $8 come on!  And $7 for Pork Fried Rice?  No way!  You might be saying, \"but you're paying $$ for sushi, isn't that a double standard?\"  No!  One should expect sushi to be on a higher price bracket than fried rice and chow fun.  To me it's like the difference between a ribeye steak dinner vs spaghetti and meatballs.  So I order just the sushi and they told me it would be about 15min, which was fine.  Then I noticed they had  a sushi bar across from where I was sitting and kinda put it together in my head that they were taking time to make fresh sushi.  Awesome... That gives them some points.  Long story short... I took it home and my wife and I thought the sushi was good for such a place like this.  The flavors were good, the rice was good, cucumbers were crisp, CA rolls had imitation crab, etc... it was pleasant but not the best.  I think this place will serve to satisfy the sushi craving whenever we cannot make it to Island Sushi... but that will be few and far between.    So for now it's a 3.5 stars for me and my wife.  The rest of the menu was too expensive to try out and the sushi was better than ok."}
{"text":"This food is delicious! I had the sunset roll and strawberry boba slush, and my mom got the Wonton soup. Their sushi is probably the best sushi I've had since I came to Vegas, and I have been here almost a year. The boba slush has me hooked and their service was good as well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Second visit so far and this time we ate in.  It was Sunday night and they were a little slow so service was excellent and very friendly.  The Egg Foo Young was VERY good as was the Sesame Chicken. Egg Rolls are tasty the day after all by themselves. Had Thai food previously and was spot on AND I consider myself quite picky so for a quick Chinese dinner I say YAY!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Delicious food every time.  The staff always greets me with a smile. You'll always be satisfied."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The food was the best version of some Chinese foods that I've had. Service was good. Food was prompt and perfectly cooked"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and satisfied my prego craving for Chinese food.   But here are the problems.   - when ordering through yelp it says that delivery is free. Now after completing my order, it was now $4.25.   - it took a little over an hour to have the food delivered (I'm literally 2 lights down from this place. (Pregnant with a toddler...yeah you get why I didn't want to drive there)  - the BIGGEST problem I had tonite was a mix up of food. Instead of sweet and sour chicken, I got shrimp chow mein.   Now what did I do? I ate the food I had because I was hungry. Could I have called them and told them to fix the mistake? Yes. Did I have the patience or a good attitude to make that phone call? No.   All in all, the food is decent. Service is decent. Just make sure to check your food before hand."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Some of the best food I've had, quality wise and portion. Definitely my new favorite!"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch or dinner. Hot fresh food Chinese or Japanese. Take out delivery or eat in. Nice new place with booths and sushi bar. Huge portions. Dinner for 1 was plenty to share. Owner was very attentive. They will deliver to Lake Las Vegas for $4.00. Much better than Panda. We loved it and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Too lazy to get out of bed this morning, we ordered $50 in delivery only to wish we had gotten out of bed and made the trek to Roberto's across the street for a burrito! The food here was obviously leftover from last night. The hot and sour soup was neither hot, nor sour. However, the combo fried rice was the latter, as the shrimp had begun to spoil. Everything was cold. And regarding the Mongolian beef...Where's the beef?! Bland at best, spoiled at worst. If you must have food delivered, get a pizza or try something else."}
{"text":"I would suppose that they have good food but the service here is absolutely horrible they take forever with there orders, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you want something quick."}
{"text":"I come here with my family now and again because it's so close.  The food is not bad.  It's pretty tasty but a little on the salty side for me.  Their portions are generous and their staff is friendly.  I would come here again but it's not something I would go out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery, which originally they had said would take anywhere from 50-60 minutes. 20 or so minutes later the door bell rang and our food arrived so I thought that was pretty neat since I was super starving. Had been promised free donuts over the phone which yes we received :) lol super friendly service and great food.... I highly recommend!  **P.s try out their wonton chips they're $1 for 3 bags**"}
{"text":"When I want some good HK style noodles, we always hit this place. I've been to a couple of different locations but the location off of Losee st. is the best and great service. They also every so often give free samples of new or special items."}
{"text":"Ordered the Family B.  Had to throw out 1/2 of it.  Worst wonton soup ever!  Only the egg rolls and crab ragoon was good.  Rice was overcooked and tasted weird.  Kung Pao had jalepenos in it and meat was soggy gross texture."}
{"text":"So strolling into this restaurant, i was very doubtful they would compare to some of my favorite Chinese restaurants (Pei Wei). We looked over the menu and found that they have a pretty huge selection of different dishes so finding something that we would like was not hard at all and the prices are very reasonable.   We ended up getting Cashew Chicken and Mongolian Beef, so we took a seat and waited for our food and they ended up delivering the food to the table in what appears to be the only serving dishes they have which is a styro-foam container. So my first thought was oh no, maybe its so bad that they want you to take it home to eat so you wont complain. So we both opened our container and the steam came up and hit us in the face and once the steam cleared out of our face we took in the portion size and were very content since we were starving.   We grubbed on the food and it was fresh ingredients and tasted awesome. The portions were huge and we ended up both taking the rest of the food home for dinner.   I think I just found a substitute to my Pei Wei since the closes one is miles away."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. I come here once a week normallly. My favorite entree is Singapore noodle.and favorite drink is Tai tea !"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been to this location. I ordered Mongolian beef and to my surprise, the amount of beef in the package was a lot. More than what I was used to, hardly any veggies. It was a nice surprise. People may have complained and I am glad they listened. I will be back to check out the meat portions on the other entree's."}
{"text":"Food is good but never ever get it delivered. They can't understand u when u give them ur address and card number. U have to repeat it multiple times. It took 90 min to get my food and it was cold and soggy. Better to pick up. Don't trust the delivery."}
{"text":"It says Chinese but they do a pretty respectable job on sushi as well. Portions are big and the food is tasty. It's our go to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The service, however, needs improvement. The staff seems pissed that you dared to bother them with your business. Everything you need seems to irritate them."}
{"text":"It took us years to find a good Chinese food place to accommodate our LA taste buds and we finally found it. The staff is always pleasant and very quick on our orders."}
{"text":"We ordered food for lunch on 7/10/17 our sao chicken is raw in the inside!!! And our honey walnut shrimp were dry. Extremly hopping we dont get food poison since we didnt check all the chicken we ate"}
{"text":"Just as good as all the other China-A-Go-Go's -- Stick with the chow mien (lo mien) and the shrimp-and-chicken pad thai -- they have this special asparagus chicken but the asparagus is hard and kinda crunchy... not soft and buttery like us Americans like it"}
{"text":"I do not recommend picking up your food.. This place is not in the best location nor is it very clean. But what comes out of here is yummy! Fast delivery."}
{"text":"Delicius food  i love it !! it is the best chinese food ive ever tried, dont go to panda express, go to China a Go Go !!!  yummy !"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever received from a restaurant. The staff was rude and hung up on me while I was ordering. Our food never arrived after waiting 2 hours. Upon canceling the lady told us we were no longer allowed to eat there. Never eating there again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious vegetarian options as well! Our go to for a filling meal."}
{"text":"Everything is ALWAYS on point! I never leave here disappointed. They have amazing service that's super speedy. The food is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is our go-to fast food Chinese restaurant. A typical order for us is Orange Chicken and Friend Rice. Service is very friendly and they are very accommodating. Can be busy during lunch and there is limited seating. Budget friendly and quick service. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time and the food is consistently hot and on time. They always listen to any special orders I have and the younger delivery guy is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and this is my go to Chinese spot! Don't let the low prices and simple set up fool ya, it is awesome!!"}
{"text":"China A Go Go, as a whole chain, is usually an okay place to get decent Americanized Chinese food. Their food always tends to be much too sweet, but it is generally palatable. This particular location is pretty terrible. I've ordered from them for either take out or delivery, four times. Their food is extra syrupy/sugary. Szechuan chicken is supposed to be spicy. The order I just received was drowning in some sort of sweet syrup. Not a touch of heat. The ingredients were correct, and the flavor was reminiscent of Szechuan, but this is going in the trash can. I also ordered a sushi roll for the first time. The roll wasn't too bad, as rolls go, but the faux wasabi is the weakest faux wasabi I have ever tasted. I could have eaten the whole portion on a spoon and not broken a sweat. A very small crumble of Wasabi is supposed to add a bit of heat and a touch of flavor. Whatever they are using, isn't even CLOSE to an acceptable wasabi knock off. I will not waste my money at this location again."}
{"text":"I used to live near this Gogo a few years back. At the time I thought it was the best Chinese take out in Las Vegas. I moved away and  now Im back in the area, so I was excited to be able to order from this particular Gogo.  Update. The driver remembered me, so that was real nice. He was always personable. The food quality and taste where not what they used to be. I order the Twice spicy cooked chicken and it was over run with hot red peppers to the point it was almost inedible. The bbq fried rice was awesome though.  The next week I ordered mushu chicken. It was more like mushu chicken soup. I wound up putting the whole container in a colander to drain all the excess liquid. I wasn't happy at all.  I gave Gogo one more chance after that, hoping they just had a bad night two (its real hard to find decent Chinese food out here). I kept my fingers crossed. I was heart broken. I ordered fried wontons, bbq sliced pork, and chicken with broccoli. The fried wontons were not crispy, in fact they were very soggy and mushy. The bbq sliced pork was like chewing leather . After eating 4 pieces I had to throw it out. The chicken and broccoli had so much ginger in it. It tasted like I was eating soap.  I will not be eating from here again. Thank you, and good night."}
{"text":"Our #1 go-to place for takeout Chinese in all of Las Vegas. Hard to beat the price/quality ratio.  The sesame beef and crispy noodles is all you need to know."}
{"text":"Great service, food has great quality and when they say they will be there they are actually early. Recommended for anybody feeling lazy and not wanting to drive anywhere!"}
{"text":"I frequently eat at and take out from this location however I don't know if they changed ownership. Because I had the sushi and was extremely disappointed. The rolls were all rice as was the sushi. The fish was sliced so thin that it was transparent and I could barely taste it. The dragon roll was all cucumber with a little eel skin inside. I am embarrassed that I paid for it. I never write reviews, however I was so disappointed that I felt compelled to do so now. It was a disgrace to pas for a bunch of rice with a hint of fish."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all. Never ordered anything that wasn't enjoyable. The sweet and sour could be a little thicker, and the vegetables in the chicken fried rice could be a little less. But always enjoyable."}
{"text":"I actually found this place trying to find a Panda Express because I wanted Chinese food and was craving it for my birthday. Well I never found Panda Express and instead found this place instead. Their lunch specials are wonderful and are a really good bang for your buck. I also tried their Japanese sushi lunch specials. I enjoyed the Philly Rolls, California Rolls, and Shrimp Rolls.   My latest trip to them yesterday, was slightly a disappointment because I was having a sushi craving and I found they had completely changed their lunch menu. They had a notice that they were changing the price on things due to the price of meats etc their prices had gone up. When I first stepped in I thought uhoh!    Yea, their sushi prices have gone up and to be truthful I am on a bit of a budget. I only go out to eat once in a blue moon or so. Yesterday, was different because I just got paid and wanted to eat out. I scrutinized their menu for quite some time and decided to go the Salmon Miso. I wasn't really sure what I was getting but wasn't disappointed in what I got. I got an assortment of tempura fried shrimp and vegetables along with some soy or terryaki sauce, miso soup, a mix of salad greens  with some sort of dressing on it, and of course a nice portion of salmon with a sauce and some rice. I enjoyed the tempura first, then soup, then the salmon and rice and then the salad. I was completely filled. It tasted good and I enjoyed the meal immensely. Yea, it didn't turn out to be what I first had intended to order but for about $10 it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Great service, horrible food. Id rather eat at Panda Express...Not really sure what kind of meat I was REALLY eating. Even the potstickers were bad..."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food the price. Its fast and its decent. The place isnt very busy during the lunch hour which is nice if your short on time."}
{"text":"The diner special hit the spot.  An entre of your choice, chow mein noodles or fried rice, an egg roll, and a soft drink for under 10 dollars.  It was good and it was more than enough food for me and ny wife.  I will go back.  Plus they deliver.  Part II, second visit resulted with great customer service, good food, and enough food to feed me for two days!"}
{"text":"I'm a Boulder City resident. Great food and great service. The sushi dishes were delicious. Very generous portions."}
{"text":"That Mongolian beef was absolutely incredible. Spicy and delicious. The delivery guy showed up with a smile. They brought everything I asked and made the process simple and seamless. I would for sure order from this place again."}
{"text":"My job moved offices to Summerlin and we all decided to try chinese food. I ordered chicken fried rice and it came in one of those cartons. There wss alot as there was no way I could finish it all.   I can't speak on the service or the ease of ordering but I know she placed the order and they were there fairly quickly. We now work at a secured building so she had to go down and get the food since they couldn't come up.   Now onto the taste. It was very bland, no flavor, dull, and not worth my money. I will never order from this place again. But beggars can't be choosey and we were hungry so this is what we got unfortunately."}
{"text":"Second visit .... first time was for the Mongolian beef lunch special which was so tasty I decided to go back and try the sesame beef lunch special.... even tho it was not on the menu , per request .... would have done a review either way because first visit was worthy of one but the fact that I got egg rolls for doin  one was even better....YAY@@@"}
{"text":"The China a Go Go on East Charleston is much better than this location.   If a business is going to be a franchise than there needs to be consistency between each location. There was hardly any consistency here.   The honey walnut shrimp was soggy and it seemed like the sauce was uncooked. The hot and sour soup was bland and it seemed like it was just sour and not spicy at all.   Hate to say it, but even the fortune cookies had flaws. My sister had one that was half cut through the middle of it and mine had a second fortune partially printed on it.   The general chicken and fried rice at least wasn't nasty, but it still wasn't as good as the other location."}
{"text":"Really folks, this place's food prep is not healthy...Watching 5 guys cooking with woks in a 7x7 area is funny...That needs to be behind doors, as it sits behind the cash register where the girl takes your money...People must not look up when they come in these doors...GROSS...Even the front door says \"were not closed door heavy\" What? Is this a sign? Food still taste OK, but you take a look at some of those people that work there...My last time at this place...Sorry folks...Next to this store is a hookah pipe store...I see who there clients are..."}
{"text":"Love the Taro Boba!! A must try! Always service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Rated just a one because I could get inside. While standing in line to order.  Saw the cook drop a potsticker on the dirty floor. He bent over picked it up and tossed back in pan.  The one who ordered this saw and got the managers attention. The cook admitted to this.  Ummmm we walked out as the Manager started speaking to us. Pass."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick bite of yummy Chinese Food. This really is the BEST Chinese food in NORTH Las Vegas. I've tried a bunch of nearby mom n' pop shops, and it was a huge disappointment. China A GoGo is perfect, and they always have the best customer service. Always a reliable place to call and pick up or dine-in if you are in need of delicious quick Chinese Food, say after a night at PT's! :-)"}
{"text":"Just tried here the other night because it smelled so good.  Service was great, food was amazing and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Chinese food fan. This is standard American Chinese. I ordered combination fried rice and chicken chow mien. It was fine, but the chicken could not be identified as white or dark. The pork and shrimp in rice was tasty. I'd go back but only if I had a craving for fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"Very good food. Had lunch & very generous servings. Staff friendly & efficient. We knew nothing about this restaurant & just decided to give it a try. Glad we did. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. I love to eat orange chicken, chow mein so many more. It's so delicious."}
{"text":"The Chinese food is good here, however their staff is sometimes rude! They don't have the courtesy to let you know they will be right w/you if they're busy. They'll just have you standing there until they're done basically. Also, there's a really rude girl in there that wears contacts that's very short w/customers! I guess they don't mind that it hurts their business. But I was a regular & have stopped going there."}
{"text":"Ordered on EAT 24 Yelp. It took,and hour and 15 min, food was cold, quality was sub par to panda express and 3X the cost. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken and fried rice and within a few minutes i had my fried rice. It took them 30 min to bring me my teriyaki chicken by that time i was already done eating and wanted to leave do to such horrible service."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  Very attentive and food always comes out very fresh! I've been to various China go go places but this one is great! After a Red Rock hike this definitely hits the right spot. Not to mention a chill atmosphere. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Chicken pad thai is full of chicken fat.  Sooo gross!!! No peanuts either.  Flavor is good but will never order again"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience when I saw them mistakenly gave my order to a guest eating at the table and started to get their first bite and the cashier said sorry that one is not your order and put that order somewhere in the back for a minute then putting it in my order to go plastic bag that they thought I wasn't watching. They gave me my order and I stop and said, I saw what you guys did. Please make me a fresh one.  They didn't even apologize or offered something."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2010. The food has been great all these years. Portions are descent. And the Customer Service good."}
{"text":"I've never been there before. I got the lunch special (sweet and sour pork.) I got home and I thought they gave me the wrong order.I guess when you take out for this dish they put the sauce on the side. It was not the same type of sweet and sour pork I've ever had before. The sauce was not thick at all! I had called and asked if I can return it and that I wasn't happy with the dish.They were very nice and said sure. I got the Magnolian beef and it was delicious! They gave me enough for 3 days.The food was very good. Chow mein was very good and so was the fried rice! I will be back but just not for the sweet and sour pork. Nice staff as well!"}
{"text":"Don't go in the morning the food was not good the honey walnut shrimp had to be left overs from the day before very disappointed"}
{"text":"More a like China a NO No... was sat quite quickly and drink order was process efficiently but waited 15 minutes no sign of server, except for the server that had passed us twice and proceeded to take the order of a table that had been sat 10 minutes after we had been sat. I wish this would review would be about their food but we never got that far."}
{"text":"New place near home. Definitely recommend...great service, large portions, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"An always reliable fallback for myself and the family. Don't be confused, this isn't like Panda... The menu is more extensive and a lil' more expensive but the portion sizes are worth it (always having a night or two of leftovers) and they deliver (usually in good time as well).  The flavor profiles are a bit richer and they give various sauces to accentuate those profiles (such as with the lemon chicken) and the plentiful sides such as steamed rice or wontons or whatever catches your fancy. If you're looking for something quick, more filling and restaurant quality but don't want to do a restaurant scene or even leave the house, give them a try."}
{"text":"The food here is always good and the service used to be great but they recently hired a woman who just stands at a distance staring at you instead of serving. I went in for lunch with my boyfriend, we ordered and he got his food within five minutes while I sat for 45 minutes waiting for them to bring mine out. When I asked about it the girl looked at me and said \"soon\" and walked away. Aside from lack of service from her the place is good. The man who I believe is a manager is very kind and welcoming we've never had an issue when he is our waiter."}
{"text":"This place makes the best Kung pao chicken. Nice and spicy. Best time to order is lunch prices are lower. Singapore style noodles also very good."}
{"text":"I come here often. Food is good and portions are plenty. Staff is friendly and their Thai Tea w/ boba is yummie!"}
{"text":"It was the only Chinese take out around the Rhodes Ranch area for awhile. To be honest, the food is average and a bit pricey in comparison to other establishments.  On the positive, their honey walnut shrimp is very tasty and I recommend it.    My only real complaint, which is a pretty big deal is that they have awful customer service.  Phone orders are always rushed and they dont reiterate your order so you dont know if they got it right. Also, they're not very welcoming at all. When you go in, they appear to just care about taking your money and rarely thank you. I always feel cheated or wrong about giving them business. The Hawaiian place door always shows their gratitude and China A No No should learn from them. I would not recommend. Try Pumi, instead."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now, given the change of address we decided to give it a shot. It was horrible!!! Over priced as well as flavorless! China bistro is a thousand times better!"}
{"text":"First time visit, really like the atmosphere, and service was great.  Looking forward to many more visits. My wife doesn't eat everybody's food really enjoyed it.  Can't wait to get her some."}
{"text":"I have been craving Chinese and found this place. The food is delicious!  We ordered the corn egg flower soup, beef fried rice,honey walnut shrimp and shrimp chowmein. They have a small dining room so it seems their business is mainly based on takeouts. I say this because most or the tables and seats were taken by people waiting for their takeout and because all our plates and bowls (with the exception of the big soup bowl) were Styrofoam. We found it pretty funny as ive never been to a restaurant that serves in Styrofoam.   Regardless,  food portions were big. We ordered the big bowl of soup for my husband and i to share and it was plenty.   The beef in was tender.  Only complaint is that the soup needed a bit more soy sauce and it would be nice to have actual plates.  Oh and honey walnut could have crisper shrimp  Other than that, I think I found my new spot!  Oh and for those four things (soup, fried rice, chow mein, honey walnut shrimp) and 2 drinks it came out to $37, not too bad."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just hungry, but I didn't think I would actually give a fast food (seating available) Chinese restaurant four stars. We ordered the sesame chicken and chicken lo mein. They gave us generous portions and it wasn't salty. If the decor was nicer, it would've made for a more memorable experience. Still, in this parking lot of restaurants (there are a few others), I would chose this place over the others."}
{"text":"HUGE portions!! Fast service! I ordered delivery and for $11 I got a huge portion of chow mein, Kung Pao chicken(yummy zucchini, peanuts, celery and spicy) egg roll, won ton strips(i think) and a drink. Took 30 minutes to get to me and it was very hot still. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food here in Vegas or at least North Vegas. I prefer China a Go Go over Golden Phoenix which is just down the street and much more expensive. I'm not sure about the egg rolls or the won tons.... Didn't quite sell me, but the beef chow mein and the orange chicken are pretty tasty. it's definitely fresher tasting food over the golden Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered crab rangoon, shrimp fried rice, shrimp chow mein, pot stickers. All 4 stars!!!! Fast delivery. Hot food. Will definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered to this place today for the first time. I ordered the family dinner. My steamed rice was half way empty from the box. I called and they are very helpful and said they would give me another box of rice. OrAnge chicken was good. The only reason why I don't give this place a 5 star is because they have me old wonton soup. It tasted so sour and expired and it smelled really bad. It's good people ok food.. Just makes sure that when you eat the food it's not expired!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and was made fast! My only concern is the size if the egg rolls. They were more along the size of a spring roll. Other then that, I enjoyed the taste, quality and quantity of it! Good job!!"}
{"text":"My wife & I have gone to the China A Go Go at 75 S. Valle Verde for years and always find their food and service to be excellent! Then we found out a China A Go Go was opening 3.5 miles from our house. Awesome we thought and couldn't wait for it to open. I kept going by there to watch the progress on the store and then finally it opened and we went with great anticipation. This was just a bit fancier than the one on Valle Verde with a small sushi bar and the chefs in a glass enclosed kitchen. My wife is from Hong Kong and a Clinical Dietitian. Why did I mention that? Becuase the first time we went we both noticed the food to be extremely salty. Ok everyone is allowed an off night so we gave it a couple of weeks and tried another dinner. SALTY, very, very salty. My wife knows chinese food and also knows this much salt in your food is to either hide the fact that it is not that fresh or they are trying to sell a lot of sodas with their food. It's a shame being so close to our home but we have resumed going to a better China A Go Go at 75 S. Valle Verde. Oh by the way, we specifically requested low salt on our second trip and still had a dinner loaded with salt. Do yourself a favor unless you want to retain water, be bloated, buy lots of drinks and have your blood pressure go up visit another China A Go Go but not this one! Maybe someday the owners & chefs will figure it out, lower the salt and maybe you won't need so many daily specials to keep your restaurant going."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful surprise with this gem in Boulder City. Incredibly fresh, fast, and reasonably priced. Authentic tasty Asian fusion. We ordered take out. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I always come by here for quick take out when I don't have time to make dinner. Beef chow fun with no vegetables is my go to dish! I also ask for hoisin sauce on the side (makes the dish a little sweet). The prices are cheap and the portions are big! What more can you ask for in Chinese take out! If you order any meat dishes to go for dinner it already comes with rice too so even better! I really don't have to cook anything! The workers here are also really nice too. Sometimes they'll give me a free soda or Chinese donuts on the house. Would recommend if you have a random Chinese food craving."}
{"text":"Food is always good . The staff is really friendly. The have a lunch special 11-4 pm thats only $6.55 ."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck Chinese food. Good portions, fast, and reasonable. I've always enjoyed the food I've ordered. I haven't tried their sushi, I go there for my Chinese fix."}
{"text":"Good food. One of the only places that will deliver to my house on the edge of town. They usually deliver pretty quick and food is always hot when it gets here. I like that they have sushi and regular Chinese food."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, I've been waiting 2 hours for some soup and an order of shrimp rangoons  the lady on the phone keeps saying I live far and that's the reason. They are now closed and I have yet to receive my order, what the fuck I will never order here again."}
{"text":"got an ad in the mail for this place and  drove by to check it out.  we ordered it to go... in teh future we will def call ahead of time seeing that it took like 20 min...  once again like i have said before i am very picky with my chinese... and i think i found my new fav!!!  the kung pao chicken had a spice to it like i have never tasted before and it was awesome!!! and the egg rolls were very yummy too....  think im going to have to start going here more often..."}
{"text":"Sigh..  I really want to see this place succeed. I really do. My family and I don't call this China a go go by its name.  We call it China a No No !   Last night, my guy got home late, and we were in a bind for dinner...We wanted something that was quick, and close to the house.  Remembering that the longest we've waited for pick up here was about 10 minutes, we decided to call.  I google'd China a Go GO in henderson, and found a menu.  When asking the woman about a menu item, she said that she didn't have anything like that. That all china a go gos are not the same.  Okay, I'll accept that.  My bad for assuming.  However, if this is the case, you should probably look into changing your name..... Seeing as how I can walk into any Chipotle and order the same thing over and over.  Just saying.  We order two of the same beef entrees.   My guy has a real sensitivity to sweetness, so we asked her if they could take it easy on the sugar. She said no, it's a PRE-Made sauce...so when everyone is yapping about how everything is so \"fresh\" and \"made to order\".... I think not.  They can not put as much on, or make it spicier. So, we opted for less sauce.   We asked both orders to have chow mein, and then a side of white rice.   We asked for a side, because we eat a lot.  Also, because we would like noodles and rice.   When asking for the side of white rice, we were told by the woman that \"it already comes with rice.\"  SO, we assumed that we were getting rice.  I go to pick up the order, and I see menus. I pick one up and just look through it. I don't see what we had originally wanted to order, so I accepted my mistake and made a mental note of it.   The woman up front, who I am guessing took my order decided to tell me how once again, all GoGo's were not the same.... To be honest, it really felt like a lecture. Really turned me off.  I paid, and drove home.  I get home, open the bag, no rice.  I open the containers, and thank golly they were marked, because I could barely tell which one had less sauce on it.    My guy called and spoke with the manager,  I guess our \"account\" has a credit on it...Whatever that means."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, clean environment, food is amazing! Whats even more amazing is the amount of food they put in the plate! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the family special for $25 and ordered the beef broccoli, orange chicken and it came with cream cheese rangoons, egg flower soup and egg roll.   First of all let me start with the worst when I called to order, the person on the other line did not know how to answer my question on what's included in the egg flower soup, which tasted horrible.  The orange chicken was too sweet and the beef broccoli let me say PANDA EXPRESS makes better Chinese food.   I would not order here again."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I guess having a yelp account makes \"anyone\" a food critic these days so those other most recent reviews MUST be the real deal.  We aren't in NY and anyone giving this place 1-2 stars because they've had better??  Cook it yourself!  Thanks China A GoGo!!!!  You've always brought my food in less than 45 minutes, piping hot and I've yet to have an issue with ANY of the food you've brought in the past 3 years.  I hadn't written a review because I didn't need to, you had at least four stars.  I hope this brings you back up some.  Those asshats that can't cook for themselves and think they have a degree in world cuisine can go hang with Cartman from South Park, lol.  Thank you again and I hope these five stars help.  Btw this is the first Chinese place that's delivered piping hot food to me with juicy tender shrimp.  Ijs.  I'm no food critic myself but I'll only order from here.  Quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Always good food.  FYI the dinners have a lot of food.   Good service and friendly.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have all you can eat sushi, and get a Pad Kee Meo Noodle to go (it's amazing). Fast service, fair prices and really good fresh Chinese/ Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but VERY good. Worth it to fulfill a craving."}
{"text":"this is one of the best Chinese spots in Las Vegas hands down! Some of the best boba and the orange chicken is fabulous! Definitely recommend  Chinese food lovers to check it out. Cheap prices and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Quality Chinese food in a jiff. Employees were super friendly and we didn't have to wait long. The honey walnut shrimp was great, and they also offer some nicely priced lunch platters. Definitely a must try for anyone passing through."}
{"text":"Great food generous portions and reasonable prices make this  a excellent choice for lunch and dinner or just a snack ."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the people are kind, yet it is better to order in person and pick up than over the phone. They need someone who can take orders AND speaks/understands proper english."}
{"text":"First visit to this brand new China a Go Go in Henderson.  I have been to several others and this one is even better.  This one has an expanded menu which includes Chinese and Japanese dishes.  I ordered my usual Mongolian Beef and ordered beef brocoli for my son.  I was ordering to go.  They provided the meals in really nice tupperware type containers rather than the usual foam containers.  The food was delicious and there was so much it will probably last me 2-3 meals.  They provided a good number of hot peppers in mine which was nice because so often I get just 1-2.  They also gave us free eggrolls.  If you like spicy I would highly recommend asking for a side of hot oil, but be careful it is pretty dang hot.  Food was cooked and provided to us in about 5-10 minutes.  Also, the front counter guy was extremely nice and explained the menu and everything to us.  I look forward to coming back and eating in so I can try the soups and some other dishes, but so far very happy with this place and even better that it's the closest to home."}
{"text":"Debated between the Thai place, the new Sushi spot, the Hawaiian joint or this place. Amigo's Taco just dont taste right any more.  Ordered a Lunch combo orange chicken and a buddah's delight for dinner.  Wow...just wow...where to begin...lets start on the outside of the plate and work ourselves inward.  Crab Ragoons Since when is it acceptable for Krab (imitation crab made from fish) to be called Crab?  Other then the imitation crab used but real crab named these were pretty decent green onions in the cream cheese gave it some flavor, soft and crunchy. Crab as well as Krab both virtually nonexistent.  Orange Chicken Lunch Combo Blandest noodles ever, they have a fried look but a 'just boiled' taste. yummy.... Orange Chicken itself....nothing to write home about. if i didn't actually look at each individual hunk of chicken and noticed that it's coated in sauce i would have assumed they missed some spots going by taste alone. Fried rice, dont want to bore anybody you see where this review is going.  And now the rant....the lunch combo includes a soup but not for takeout orders. So...I pay the same price as someone who eats in but i'm denied something i paid for...Now i can understand the whole 'to go fast food' concept which is why it's not offered but at least give the customer the option. It doesnt even have to be in bowls resulting in an increase in dishes to wash, why not use small disposable coffee cups? Let the customer sip on some soup while they wait for the food to cook. They do advertise 'Fresh to Order' nothing's sitting under a heating lamp, the time between placing an order and picking up an order could be spent sipping on soup rather then thinking to yourself 'did the guy even greet me when i walked in?'"}
{"text":"Great for a quick fix of some greasy chinese food. Mongolian beef & crab rangoons are really good!!"}
{"text":"I used to love eating here couple years back. I moved to southern highlands and didn't like that China a gogo since all the do is stuff half your entree with veggies and barely any meat. I went back to the one by Rhodes ranch and was very dissatisfied with there new Togo dishes which seem like half the portion compared to the old fashioned Chinese Togo cups. Probably not gonna eat here anymore due to the portion to price ratio which is a shame cause it used to be good. Might as well go next door and eat all you can eat sushi!"}
{"text":"i love this place! But the inside dining sucks and their delivery is awful! Not only did they forget my sweet and sour for my sweet and sour shrimp, they told me it would take another hour to get it delivered!  The only way to enjoy this place is to order your food, pick it up and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"Fast delivery is the only thing good about this place.  Beef and broccoli tasted like shrimp.  The chicken was horrible.  I couldn't even eat the rice that came by itself.  It was so bad that it made me sick the whole night.  I threw out almost $30 in food because I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Love love love their food & their mango boba! We've been coming here for years & food is always great!"}
{"text":"The food served at China A Go Go is outstanding. The portions are large and the service is swift. My favorite is Honey Walnut Shrimp"}
{"text":"The kung pao chicken was extremely bland and, like a previous reviewer said, was very heavy on the zucchini. I'm not a big fan of spicy things, but I love the rich blends of ginger and garlic you usually get with kung pao. This restaurant doesn't offer that. I couldn't taste anything in this sauce."}
{"text":"First time me& my family ordered from China A go go! However we ordered shrimp fried rice, chicken chow mein & egg rolls! Delicious the delivery was fast. Omg we really enjoyed it! Thanks"}
{"text":"These guys absolutely do not care about service or quality... We ate here before and it was a bad experience but we tried again but still bad. Food about 6 out of 10 We asked three times for the same things and it took over 20 minutes to get our order, which was only 2 items.  Go to the one on windmill or the ann road location. This way the service and food will be perfect.   We will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"They always do a great job.  I usually get orange chicken for my daughter and cashew chicken for me.  We love both!  I did get lemon chicken last time and I liked the cashew chicken much better.  WE also like their sugar donuts.  The staff is really nice and it is nice to get Chinese food from Chinese people.  They have always been friendly and we have had no problems ordering."}
{"text":"Came back here for dinner again, food never let you disappointed. Friendly staff ,great service. Highly recommend. They got new chef specials, just check it out."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews, I was so excited to try this restaurant. I was do disappointed with the Thai chicken that I ended up eating left overs verses what I ordered. Epic failure!"}
{"text":"I ordered General Tsao's chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and egg drop soup. The portions were generous, and everything was fresh. The General's chicken had just enough vegetables, and sauce. The egg rolls were crispy, and tasted like they had just rolled them. The fried rice tasted made to order as well. Will definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious definitely our new Chinese restaurant  staff was very friendly and the food was fresh and Hott"}
{"text":"Not the same as the other locations. Recipes are different. Was a regular at another location then moved. Honestly cannot get the same pot stickers or won ton soup. What is the point of having the same name if the recipes are different."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Especially the salt and pepper chicken. The combination fried rice is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch! The lunch Special portions are huge! So much for so little price! They also come with fried rice/ chowmein. My bf ordered  the orange chicken, it was delicious! I got the Kung Pao chicken! It was pretty spicy for some reason, it was flavorful tho. They also have sushi here which i like! They have all you can eat sushi for dinner! I tried the deep fried roll along with my lunch and i loved it.    They also serve boba drinks, i ordered a thai tea with boba. The Thai Tea was sweetened to perfection, not to much not to little. Ive also ordered a Taro boba and it was delicious. Last time i came i ordered the Mongolian beef and thought it was okay. I'm tempted to try out more things here, its very close to my house.         If you live near by its definitely a place to try, but i wouldn't drive here from across town or anything. Lets just say ill never go to panda express again, there is one like across the street. Portions are bigger here, service is better and this is an actual restaurant. Prices are similar."}
{"text":"I placed an order about a week ago and spent about 50 bucks. Portions were a good size so I definitely can't complain about quantity but quality was not there. I ended up throwing away everything I ordered with meat. I have no clue what meat they claim to use but for one the chicken and beef looked the same aside from color an also has the same consistancy... never have had chicken and beef with the same consistancy because it naturally doesn't.... RED FLAG. Veggies and rice were fine. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Anyone that thinks this place is bad really needs to rethink their opion. This place has some pretty good chinese but it's kind of a fast food style place but 100 times better than Panda Express. Try the bbq pork fried rice, lemon chicken, sweet/sour chicken and mongolian beef. I like how you can see how they cook the food in the back, if you are the kind of person who like to cook, it's a neat thing to watch."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical but was proven way wrong. The food was really good and fresh and the service was excellent, we will deffinatly be returning and recommending this location"}
{"text":"All I can say food is made fresh awsome the best I love it definitely my new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Very friendly, service was great, and our meal came out the with in minutes. I also got the coconut boba.. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered sesame chicken, sesame beef and corn egg flower soup.  The sesame chicken was pretty good, the rice was good,  but the sesame beef was so overcooked, we couldnt eat it...it was like they started out with\" beef jerky and made sesame beef from that.... my husband loved the soup. We will order from them again... I just hope it wont be that bad again when we do....."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. They have a terrific menu with many great choices for everyone! My grandkids always ask for China a Go Go... Way better than fast food!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food Amazing customer service. Food served to perfection every single time we have been here."}
{"text":"Im not really a huge fan of Chinese food however if I do eat it, it's from CHINA A GOGO and nowhere else. Love eating here. So happy they opened up a location by my job. They have great lunch specials and the Thai tea is BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so tasty.. I'm a regular here. I love Japanese and Chinese food and they also have tea, fried foods and salads. I can order a lot of great tasting food that is made so fast and is fresh."}
{"text":"Not very good, chow mein was soggy. I ordered the Kung pao combination, it literally had two pieces of each meat, it was mostly cellury and peanuts.The fried rice was really greasy, I didn't even finish the plate  Waste of money and time!"}
{"text":"I'm always happy with this place. Easy to order online and easy to pickup. Sometimes the wait inside is a little long due to them answering so many phone in orders. I usually get some chow fun and sometimes pad Thai. They never disappoint. You can do a check in and get a free egg roll! Always a lovely bonus."}
{"text":"This the worst Chinese food I ever  have, today I try eat family dinner B for two they didn't give water, when I ask about hot chilly oil the server said they charge $0.25, and when I ask for chopsticks the server just walk away"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say except they're always amazing and they're on every other block, my go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"First time we have tried this place and ordered to go and the food was great. Not only was it hot but it was packaged nicely. They give generous portions with their entrees especially with the lunch special. Definitely worth your bucks. The boba drinks were so good too that we went back later to get another, I recommend the mango. Hong Kong style noodles were separated to keep noodles crispy and mix for it was piping hot. The food did not feel heavy or salty, tasted great! Try their hot and sour soup. Next time were trying the sushi!"}
{"text":"Please don't go, I got BBQ pork and vegetables and sweet and sour soup with fried rice, and a crab rangoon. Let's just say the only thing I wanted to continue to eat was the rangoon... everything sucked, the pork tasted like it was a day old microwaved chicken and the veggies were way over cooked. Let's not even talk about the soup just horrible."}
{"text":"Always great tasting food! Customer service is great too. They even allowed me to be picky with my lunch special and get no entree just noodles and rice. My wife is picky too with her broccoli and beef lunch special but they always accommodate. We've been getting delivery and they're so nice when they come. Ever since we found this place we haven't tried any other Chinese food places."}
{"text":"Great food and everything is made fresh in the kitchen, you can see the chefs cooking if you look towards the back. I love quick Chinese food but some places aren't that great, this place is amazing!!!   I go on my lunch break normally and the service is always quick, hot, tasty and the female servers/cashiers are extremely nice and helpful. They make sure you are taken care of at all times and happy.  The food is really good, if you dine in (the way I do on lunch) they give you some type of chips that are fried and comes with a sweet sauce......amazing! You get a large of amount of rice with pretty much any dish along with your food. The meal portions are very large and more than enough for one person and I eat like a pig! I also think they have some of the best egg drop soup in town, I just wish they had white pepper but that's not important.  Overall if you live Chinese food that's done well, cooked fresh and you are in the area then give a try you won't be disappointed and you will come back for sure....like me haha!"}
{"text":"super fast delivery- delicious food, awesome! We tried a bunch of different food and it all had great flavor. I really liked the vegetables in light garlic sauce- actually had flavor instead of that bland white sauce at other places. We will order delivery again many times for sure! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I always used to order from here..but now I will never eat their food ever again. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl and as I was eating it I felt something sharp in the chicken...I thought it was a bone ..but when I pulled it out.. I found that it was a finger nail! I was so disgusted that I had to keep myself from vomiting. Then when we called to tell them about it she told us it's not theirs because they don't have fingernails. The woman we talked to on the phone said she could give us the number to their insurance so we agreed to call...but then she changed her mind and said she could give her insurance our phone number and she refused to give us the number. She finally agreed to give us a refund...but when we went in for the refund they only refunded the bowl and not the entire order...plus I noticed that none of the cooks are wearing gloves. I am thoroughly disgusted and will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I always get the teriyaki bowl when I come in. I've tried other items too and it was all great. It's probably my favorite american chinese style restaurant. It's the same every time too. Each time I've come in, the food is just as good. Never a bad day. It's consistently good food  Customer service is awesome too. The people there are all really nice and welcoming. It's basically everything you want in a restaurant. No real reason for it to be less than 5.   Good Food. Good Customer service.   That's all you need. As long as I'm in the area I will continue to come here"}
{"text":"This place is amazing from the food to the service its hand down my fav Chinese food place!!!! I order from this place AT LEAST once a month, I don't have any issues with the food or the service ever...BUT last time i  ordered  their China go go wings, and they weren't crunchy than other times they were tasteless and kinda mushy i was kinda pissed cus out of everything that's what I was craving!!!!, now that is the only time I can think about them messing up or them slippn. Great place to get your Chinese fix.Friendly, Quick, Delicious, and Inexpensive!!!  JUST SO YOU KNOW!!!! i ordered the New York style Chow Mein, I don't know what i was expecting but definitely not what I got...It wasn't your typical noodles and it had a lot of veggies...NOT saying it was bad but it wasn't anything i was expecting. It was Good but i wouldn't order it again!  *******Honey walnut shrimp BEST HANDS DOWN SUCKAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but I ordered online and paid with my card no tip option available, when the delivery guy arrived he told me it was cash I thought he meant the whole bill (I said I don't have cash) when I realized he was only referring to the tip it was too late he snatched the paper out of my hand and stormed off. Had he been nice at all I would have been able to try and at least find him a cash tip. Very rude will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Ive been here 5 times in the last month.  The food is good and the service is great.  I will be going back as long as it stays the same.  I dine in and its nice and clean.  The price of the food is great and the portions are big.  You wont leave hungry."}
{"text":"Really, really good food, excellent service, best Chinese food we have had in a long time, HUGE portions! We will be back! ."}
{"text":"I've never been inside the restaurant, which truly doesn't matter because the looks are not going to fill up my stomach.  I always order to go and man I will tell you that their delivery is probably faster than figuring out what to order and placing the order. So far I have ordered about 3 times from this place and their consistency to deliver is always A1. As much as I always want to try something new, this place shook me out from my seat because their food is incredibly delicious. From the 3 times I have ordered, all 3 times I have ordered the Wor Wonton, Chicken Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, and Mongolian Beef. Let's get with the Wor Wonton. I love how it has all the meets of chicken, beef, and shrimp. I don't know if that's how everyone has gotten theirs but mine always has all three meats. Like I had mentioned about consistency, they are killing it with the flavor in that soup. Though Vegas has its hot weather year round, you cannot go wrong with their Wor Wonton Soup! Chicken fried rice now. You order you regular, which ever meat, friend rice, but they always gift you plain white rice, I never asked why but it definitely came in handy for a different mean the next day!  Now with the meals of Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian beef! Let me tell you that there is a warning sign of the food bein spicy hot! They are not lying! Those two combo plates are HOT! The flavor is of the roof! Just amazing if you love spicy food!  Next time you want Chinese food, it should not take you long to decided between places, head to CHINA A GO GO, it's a MUST GO TO place. Enjoy and Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I don't know but the noodles always takes for me to me at that restaurant later working on cleaning water but everything  Else taste OK"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. We have been coming to this location for over four years. The people that work here are very nice and courteous. This is my go to place for Chinese food.  Keep up the marvelous job! You all are awesome!"}
{"text":"It's our first time, my choice for Mother's Day.  It smells delicious walking in.  The restaurant staff is friendly - and fast. Table service!  Nice for a change.  Oh look! The server just brought us two cute little donuts!  Serving are generous.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Delivery time was under 20 minutes and they have a huge selection of Chinese food. They will customize any order according to spice level, oil level etc. Only downside was that they did not have brown rice. I'll together very highly recommend this place for late night Chinese food."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on a whim after hearing some other people say they like this place. The lady on the phone was nice, the delivery guy was nice and got to our house very quick. However, the food was terrible. We ordered chicken pad thai, beef fried rice, and egg rolls. We had to throw away all of it because it was just really gross. Definitely the worst Chinese food we have ever had. I wish it was good because we live so close but it's just not edible."}
{"text":"I a new transit from the East Coast.  Have ordered from this location over 5 times.  My food came cold the 2nd time I ordered and they replaced the meal, fine.  On New Years Eve 2014 ,  i ordered and the food came in over an hour, the soup which is usually awesome, was watered down and tasteless and my Orange chicken and fried rice just as bad.  Please step up your delivery game, you have great food, but as it stands, I will microwave a frozen dinner before ordering delivery from China A Go Go again!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting Asian food choice, Japanese, Chinese, Thai etc. Overall is acceptable if you are not picky."}
{"text":"I had the general chicken and my son had the hot garlic chicken. We both liked it. My daughter had the chicken skewers. The sugar donuts to start with were tasty and the kids hoovered them down."}
{"text":"The Chinese food is good, but the sushi can be tricky. When paying for the all-you-can-eat, they are extremely slow to bring the orders. I ordered three rolls. It took them 20 minutes to bring the first one and after they brought it, the waitress asked me if I was sure if I wanted the other two rolls. I said I wanted them. It took 30 minutes to get the next roll and another 15 minutes after the to get the third roll. The sushi itself tastes okay. Nothing special. They shouldn't offer all-you-can-eat sushi as they are clearly concerned you might order alot."}
{"text":"I don't often eat out, but this location has been my choice twice in the past few months. Both times, I was greeted instantly and could order with no wait. The food was quick to come out, and the Thai tea I ordered, with light ice was perfect. I took my food home to go and it was still hot and delicious about 15 minutes after I picked it up. Now, I'm full of assorted meats, rice and a bonus donut. Will be going to this location for all of my reasonably priced, Americanized Chinese food needs."}
{"text":"everytime I order from this place it is absolutely phenomenal, the crew that works there are always so nice. Love the little donuts"}
{"text":"The quality of food was okay. It took 45 mins for the delivery and there were no utensils at all. I can't understand why, the location was 3 mins from my home but because I was unable to leave I had to wait really long. Blah, that's neither here nor there ... the driver was lost even after giving very simple instructions. Might be my last visit, unless I order something new from the menu."}
{"text":"Typical CAGG.  Good food served quickly.  Large portions - easily 2 meals from even the lunch special.  Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Just ok.  We have tried a few times now and haven't been impressed.  Our first visit we got takeout shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein and a few sushi rolls.  Next 2 visits we ate in and got lunch specials.  I don't get the hype.  The food is average and a tad overpriced.  Never had any issues with service though.  I will give them that."}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving Chinese food. Before we stopped by at the restaurant, we went to the website to decide what we wanted to order. We were greeted by a friendly cashier who made a few personal recommendations and suggested that we take our time ordering some food. We decided to get salt and pepper chicken wings, combination fried rice, sesame beef and fried doughnuts. The food was made to order and it was absolutely delicious. The restaurant is around the corner from my house, which is a short walking distance.   I'd like to come back and try the Singapore noodles, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken and Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"We loved ordering from China A Go Go until yesterday when we got molded noddles in our Shrimp Cho Mein"}
{"text":"Please anyone who gave a one star, please have significant other write a review as I have a mother who would give one star or less to a Ruth Chris Steakhouse in NYC, which is a common 4.5 to 5 star rating for years..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Never again will I order from here.  Ordered through yelp & got the egg drop soup & honey walnut shrimp.  Shortly after, got a call from them.  EVEN CONFIRMED OVER THE PHONE THAT IT WAS FOR EGG DROP SOUP AND HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP.  Come home to vegetable soup.  Noticed right away and called them.  Well, the lady who answered the phone was not only argumentive but extremely rude.  We've placed large orders there for parties but after that fiasco, I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went in and was greeted and helped with making my order which was nice...BUT THEN i watched as every employee ate and still performed there duties! it was the end of the night so maybe they didnt care?? i was horrified as i watched the cook stuff his mouth with meat as he cooked my food and the girl behind the cash registar ate off her plate and packed my food...i couldnt even speak i was shocked! i swore id never go back, it was disgusting...and unclean"}
{"text":"We love this place! Every time we are pleased with how yummy our food is and the service is great! Their donuts are super yum!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the food isn't bad. Last time we ordered and I got SO SICK, I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Thank you God!!!  Finally Chinese food that tastes like NYC!!!  I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special which was very good and WAAAAAAY too much food!!!  The girl on the phone said it came with fried rice and some sort of noodle......well to my surprise it was LO MEIN!!!!  You can't get that out West!!!  I will be back a LOT!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is palatable, but they're service and attitude are terrible. Every time I go to pick up my order, they always have a negative tone and I can't ever get them to look me in the eye. It's a shame because their food is actually alright."}
{"text":"I had the sesame need and fried wontons and it was delicious will definitely have again"}
{"text":"When it came to wanting Chinese food, I ordered from China a go go on the phone to place an order to pick up at 2:30. I got a call at 2:24 when I was on the way there asking about if I was headed there and the extremely rude lady who takes the orders on the phone said they'd start the order. I got there and added to my order and asked for a Thai tea no boba. While I waited for my order, someone brought me a Thai tea with boba so I went over and asked them about it. She said we're just gonna take the boba out and give it back. So I was like fine whatever. I'll just keep it then. The lady on the phone gave free stuff away to others who came and my order wasn't finished till 3 which defeated the whole purpose of me placing my order on the phone for pick up. Never going here again because of the horrible customer service and low quality yet over priced food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner. It said it would take 60 to 75 minutes. It arrived 25 minutes later, so happy with the service. I had the sesame beef and my husband had the broccoli beef. The food was incredibly yummy. It was a lot of food so we have lots of leftovers. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This location is great! Great customer service and very timely! I really enjoy the boba and the chow mein here, it's really hard to find a good chow mein. I recommend this place for Chinese food to everyone."}
{"text":"Great little place for Chinese food clean friendly and the food is good best place to eat in the Northwest"}
{"text":"Great service clean and big portions.  I had Mongolian beef not too spicy they use lot of red onion bell peppers.   They don't rush you to get out always checking on you  very tentative."}
{"text":"We got so much food! Servings sizes are huge. Food was pretty yummy. I liked their orange chicken"}
{"text":"That was the best fucking Chinese food I ever had! Highly Recommend it to anyone with a hungry family."}
{"text":"I love ordering from this place! My favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas! The food is always tasty and finished in a timely manner! I order from here at least once a month (if not more)!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner one night with family and it was so good. Every dish we ordered was fresh and the staff was friendly.   Now I want to try their sushi. So I'll be back China !"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised at how good this food is!! Being from the NE, it's not easy to find great Chinese food. This place is awesome! Delivered on time and delicious!! We had the orange chicken, beef chow fun, and shrimp fried rice. All great!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times since they have opened. Everything has been delicious so far. My favorites are the Hot Garlic Beef and the Lettuce Wraps. The slushes are fun and so ice cold I get brain freeze every time! We always order delivery and it gets to the door in less than twenty minutes, piping hot. So far, a great addition to Boulder City."}
{"text":"First time at this location and the service was great. Prices are reasonable! Cashier was awesome!"}
{"text":"Not gourmet by any means but among the best quick Americanized Chinese food places in area.  Kung Pao chicken was spicy but flavorful.  Not just hot.  Beef and broccoli had fresh veggies and lots of meat. Lunch specials are a fantastic value.  Get soup, rice, noodles and entree for 8 bucks or so. Cheaper than Panda and light years better. Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Such sweet service! The employees are  Very kind. I just picked up my order tonight and they gave me a free drink because I had to wait 5 minutes. Good food too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's affordable delicious and I'm glad I found it. You are able to see the cooks prepare and cook your meal fresh and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The pork fried rice is not good by any means.  The sweat n sour chicken is pretty good though."}
{"text":"China a go go recently became my new favorite chinese spot to go to. Beef pepper steak with white rice, and crab rangoon are my favorites. They come in big portions too, so i usually get lunch and eat the left-over for dinner. or get dinner and eat the left-over for lunch the following day :) I keep telling myself \"I'm going to try something new next time i go there\", but every single time i walk in there, my mind gets locked on beef pepper steak... but next time i'll try something different! ;) I really will! (hopefully)"}
{"text":"Delivery guy is always nice. Good food, great service when we eat there. Great portions."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find good Chinese food around my area. My roommate and I stumbled across this place awhile ago and have been huge fans ever since. Everything is so good... their wonton soup is the absolute best! We've tried the orange chicken and sesame chicken several times and they never disappoint. We usually order delivery through YELP but we recently walked in and dined in and it was just as great. The service was great! People were helpful and friendly. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Great value.  3 sushi dishes were all made fresh. One Chinese lunch special that could easily fill 2 ordinary appetites."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Thought we'd give this place a shot as we were looking for a break from the low-quality buffets and it delivered. Food was excellent with a wide variety of options. Most notably, however, was the family dinner combos. Two entrées with a plethora of other foods thrown in made a great deal at around $25. The only disappointment I had was with the orange chicken, which was a little old tasting. Overall, makes for a very good dinner."}
{"text":"I've ordered several times from China A GoGo, always FAST delivery!  The portions and quality of food has always been pretty good. A little disappointing in the past 2 times, Both my Friend and I had our order all screwed up.....and the lady even repeated it back to me 3 times over the phone.....and I sure did get charged for everything extra.....ie. pork fried rice, Teriyaki Chicken didn't even come with the sauce, so my friend had to eat it DRY....Oh well.....I guess that's what we get for ordering 30 minutes before they were about to close.... I will definitely order again and make sure to check my order BEFORE the delivery guy leaves."}
{"text":"Food is freshly made and delivery is available. Prices could be a bit better, however quantity of food is more than enough for 2 people. Overall average tasting Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food quality at this place as far as their cooked menu food (no sushi) is always spot on and really decent for the price. The sushi is a different story and I don't order it any more since the quality doesn't seem to stay the same. A nice addition to the area but delivery is slow no matter the distance it seems."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. I would have given at least one more star but the customer service was horrible. I ordered something for to go since I wasn't really in the mood to sit down. I came on in time for their lunch special. The choice were decent but the lady that helped me was really bad. Very sarcastic. I tried to order something ala carte besides the lunch menu but she insist on me getting the lunch combo which I politely decline 4x. But she still insist on it so I finally told her \"just do what you want to do coz I think I don't make sense to you\".   Mind you, I wasn't being rude, just frustrated. If somebody says no 4x, I think that's a clear message \"I don't want it\".   I would still go give this place a second try. Hopefully with a better person on the other end of the counter. I've been to other China a go go branches. Always at least 3 or 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Great food and a quick place to grab a well cooked meal. Amazing service and worth the tip!"}
{"text":"No....third try and DONE. Hot Garlic beef had peppers in it but tasted sweet like sugar water. Mu Shu had cartilage and stringy old something that was not quite chicken. Wife had Teriyaki and there was no sauce...very bland. Ordered two orders of egg roll and received one.  $42 bones with a tip on a delivery order. Chalked it up to a lesson learned and never looking back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food is delicious! It is one of the best Chinese food restaurants in Henderson/Las Vegas. They offer eat in, take out and delivery. I always get the lunch order and its enough for 2 meals honestly. The restaurant is clean and the staff is always polite when we visit."}
{"text":"I usually get delivery or takeout and their staff is quick and efficient. They offer a few vegetarian (vegan) dishes that are really good; my favorite is the fried tofu with vegetables. Once I accidentally ordered something that was pre-made with fish sauce and they actually called to let me know. Overall good, consistent place."}
{"text":"If I could give it half a star I probably would do that, place always stinks, and when you decide to order for delivery even though my place is only 10-15 mins away it takes more than 1hr 30 mins for it to be delivered, cooks are always smoking and I've not seen anyone wash their hands after a smoke break, and did I say this THE PLACE STINKS!!!!!!!! The food taste is super unusual at first I thought it was the whole chain but went to a different location and taste was different, soggy orange chicken, nasty walnut shrimp, and the portion is rice given is always small, like I understand having small portions but you know it's small when you have to boil your own rice at home to add to their portion to eat the meat portion of that meal."}
{"text":"While there's nothing authentic about CAGG, it is a solid, inexpensive stand-in for Americanized Chinese food. Some of the sauces are cloyingly sweet, but if you stick with the savory dishes you will be in better shape. You can get a boatload of food for under $30, and the entree sizes are large enough to share, so order with restraint. The Lo Mein is particularly good."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want \"fake\" Chinese food, but you still want it to be delicious. THIS IS IT! It is authentically stereotypical American-Chinese food at its best. Completely blows Panda Express out of the water!  I was seriously craving some \"fake\" Chinese food, and this place was open, took online ordering through Yelp, and was on the way. Couldn't have been more perfect! So I ordered the corn egg drop soup, combo fried rice, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and shrimp chow mein.  The fried rice was seasoned and cooked perfectly! Great proportion of veggies with egg with meat and rice. Beautiful soy-color and flavor. This could almost pass for real Chinese fried rice, except for the carrots. The shrimp chow mein was just how I like it. Long strands of noodles with some veggies and shrimp...but the veggies didn't distract from the noodles themselves. Orange chicken was done perfectly, and I think it's almost as good as Panda Express. It was slightly too saucy, but the sauce was the right tart and sweet. The corn egg drop soup was plentiful in egg white, but needed more corn. The soup base was on par. The Mongolian beef was disappointing...they use too much beef tenderizer (or corn starch). It would be best if they didn't use any at all because it makes the beef taste slimy and loses the texture of beef. I'm not a fan of using tenderizer to soften the meat because texturally and flavor wise, it's a lost cause.   Reasonably priced...delicious slushy drinks. If they can improve on their beef dishes, I'd be inclined to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best damn Kung Pao I've ever had. Seriously.  The combination version has lots of shrimp chicken and beef . YUMMO.  My go to since I gave up carbs.  I just ask the cook to leave out the rice.  I'm on my way to pick some up now."}
{"text":"Did a delivery of orange chicken and pad Thai thought I try it out... Never ordering Thai food at a Chinese restaurant .. Portion was good and filling not much flavor and the chicken is mushy. Delivery was quick."}
{"text":"This is not the first time that I have had an issue with this business. But I feel like after the experience that my friends and I had today I need to share it for others. So apparently I am no longer allowed to order for delivery from them according to one of the workers there. After it took over an hour of waiting for our food we decided to cancel because it was just for white rice and orange chicken. We do not live far from that location and they were not busy when we left the restaurant from when we picked up our food earlier. It started when we arrived there the first time to order the family B dinner the guy was very rude as if he did not want to be there so he was rushing me to order. Then I asked for a side of white rice and he just looked at me with an annoyed look and said ok but did not put it in the order. Which is why we called in a delivery of white rice. That's when we had more issues. The guy on the phone was extremely rude after we ordered, we tried to give him the address but before we could he hung up. So we called a second time to give them an address and he said forcefully \"WHAT IS THE ADDRESS!!\" So we gave it to him then he hung up immediately. Half hour later we have not gotten our rice and orange chicken and we thought that they might need the code. So we call to make sure that they had it and the guy yelled again \"WE HAVE THE CODE IN THE SYSTEM AND WE'RE BUSY RIGHT NOW! \" then he hung up.. We wanted to give them our gate code because it had change since the last time we ordered from them but the guy did not even let us have a word in. An hour passes and at this point we don't want the food and they are about to close anyway. So we call and ask if we could cancel and it was a lady this time. She said the guy was on the way so we said \"ohhh\" and she asked \"do you still want to cancel?\" And we said \"is that possible?\" She said \"well the food is already ready here!\" But earlier she said the guy was already on his way so I don't know if she lied or what, but that was a little fishy. So we told her that we have been waiting for more than an hour so we would like to cancel it she response with \"ohh well if you cancel this then you can no longer order food from us!\" So all in all it was just a horrible experience from the beginning and the 1st time I let it slide but this time I won't. I will no longer being going there."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and found this place on YELP, I was hungry for Chinese and this appeared to be the place to go. First, they deliver!!!!! WOW Second, in addition to Chinese they also serve Pad Thai.  Next, serving sizes are good enough for left overs so two meals for the price of one. Price is very reasonable, $10.95 for a lunch. Drinks and appetizers are extra.  God is not over cooked, veggies still have a bit of a snap to them, not cooked to mush. When I first walked in I was taken back because I thought it was take out only but seating is just around the half wall that separates the kitchen from the seating area. My waiter was very attentive and polite.  The eating area is kept very clean. I will definitely come here again whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"I work at HENDERSON HYUNDAI its fast and easy. always at a great price, tastes great... i will recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Forget the sushi in this place, it has limited sushi from the all you can eat menu, a tease from what is on the menu if you would just pay as you go. The reason I'm not killing this place is because the Chinese food in this place is good, always liked the take out from here, but don't come here for the sushi..:("}
{"text":"I still feel very uneasy about eating at this place! Because of them I have stopped eating All Sushi! Beware of where you get your fish from. I got instantly infected after eating Salmon Sashimi twice from China A GoGo. It was after complaining about a dish they delivered; it was not the right dish and it looked like old fish. They redelivered my order which was very very fast and for free, only to discover everyone that consumed the sashimi dish (sashimi bowl) got very sick within 8 hours of eating this dish. We had severe diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fevers and chills. This lasted two weeks followed my swollen stomach that never went down. I am a healthy person and very fit; I rarely eat out so it was kind of easy to pinpoint where and when this occurred. A few months later my symptoms got really bad (lets just say time has passed and I am still paying for eating here). I will not go into this story anymore just know if you eat at this place they may smile in your face (they are quite friendly, or are they?) while serving you and gawk at you while you are eating your meal, even when they deliver your food!  Be cautious if you order raw fish from this place (seriously please read others reviews), know that infestation is real so you should probably stick to an authentic Japanese place, then at least you know that the people preparing your food know what they are doing.   But for the most part the Chinese food is cheap, quite good and decent if you want Japanese or Chinese food and its super convenient! But they have lost all business from my company for Good! The sad part is I truly had no problem with China A Gogo until this incident, in fact I was a regular customer. I cannot deal with their rudeness or raw fish infestation possibilities anymore. Even now as I write this honest review I am being told that I am not allowed to be honest about my experience with China agogo on Yelp even though I got food poisoned from this place twice, I am not to warn others. Once again this review is a subjective (based off of my experiences in this establishment) but isn't that the point of leaving reviews on Yelp? Then why is China A gogo having a hard time hearing the truth? Good luck and eat wisely folks and please be well!"}
{"text":"Never coming here again!  Food was just ok, service threw me off!  Called in my order, they told me it'll be ready in 5-10mins. Got to the place about 10mins and it wasn't busy. Service lady ask for my phone number, she stated it's almost done about 5 more mins. My husband and I were waiting for a good 15mins watching other customers get their food before us when they ordered after we arrived. So we asked what happened to our food and the service lady said it's been ready and waiting for at least 5mins. We stated how come you never called us and she stated coz we haven't paid!  Lady!!!! We checked in with you and was waiting for our food to be serviced and rendered!  Wtheck!  I didn't have the heart to leave mainly because I was starving and been waiting for my food that I phone ordered and had to wait for at least 15-20mins extra!  Disappointment is what my husband and I experienced from this place!  Bad bad bad.  To top it off the restaurant's whole family came in and it was just a mess. One came in started messing(preparing)with the vegetable that they use to cook, mind you, I do not think she washed her hands!  Eww gross!"}
{"text":"Just past Red Rock Hotel & 215 freeway, high up on the corner of Charleston & Desert Foothill Rd. (Albertsons shopping center) is a gem of a place.  Don't let the out of they way area fool you.  Ordered for the first time here & was impressed by how fresh the food was & how delicious!  The best Chinese food in the area & I have tried all of them during my visits to this side of Vegas.  The price is on point & the people were friendly.  The Pad Thai was yummy.  My husband loved the sauteed garden vegetables!  The veggies were cooked perfectly, crisp & flavorful.  The steamed rice that came with the meals were fluffy not hard like the other places.  Looking forward to trying out the other dishes.  Thank you China A GO GO, will be back for more."}
{"text":"There are several China a go go locations throughout vegas that I have been to and this one along with the one on green valley tend to stand out. As far as this one goes its the nicest to sit down and eat at out of the 4 I have frequented. The only reason this gets 4 stars and not 5 is that the food can sometimes be inconsistent. Not bad ever, but sometimes it can be just ok. There mongolian beef is a favorite of mine, but can be a bit spicy for the not so spicy inclined. You are however you are able to ask for it without the chili peppers which still I would imagine would taste just as good. The staff is nice and attentive and the service is always solid. Overall not a bad place to go at for dinner or to go in and enjoy a good lunch special during your break from work."}
{"text":"Just average Chinese food. The Hunan beef was pretty good, but there was nothing special about anything else. The hot and sour soup had a strange taste. I didn't know the portions are family style and I ended up ordering way too much food. I will try somewhere else before ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Had tea duck, ribs and wings. Tea duck tasted like putrid carcass, ribs were drenched in corn syrup sauce, and wings were tasteless but covered in numbing jalapeño and scallion topping to mask the lack of flavor. Went there for take out to accompany a movie late night and I highly regret trusting the high reviews. It turns out the place gives out fried rangoons to those who \"show\" their Yelp reviews. This place should be taken off the list. Yes, it is that bad."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and very respectful great customer service from the door. And the prices are cheap"}
{"text":"This was our go to place for Chinese for quite awhile, we used to have them deliver our food, but have discovered that it came to us either spilled in the bag or cold.   We have since decided we would order it and pick it up. They don't take long to make and it is always good and hot when we get it home. The staff is wonderful and we will continue to go.   The reason they received 4 stars instead of 5 is just for the convenience of going to get the order."}
{"text":"Super nice people run this one and they are great for a quick sushi or Chinese lunch or dinner. PLUS they deliver!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese take-out.  Best chow mein is town. My favorite entree is the Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken a close second. Only gripe is that they close when I get off work!"}
{"text":"This is some of the worst Chinese food I've had in memory.  This is like those places they used to have in the suburbs in the midwest in the 80s.  Every single item was either deepfried or covered in a sauce loaded with extra sugar, guai lo style.  I got the appetizer sampler which was just several versions of slightly different shaped, bland, tasteless, deep fried eggroll and wonton-ish looking things - dripping with oil.  Ordered the salt and pepper pork chop because of another yelp review and also they list it as Chef's special.  These turned out to be double breaded and deep fried pieces of pork with a ton of bone still on.  Some pieces was just deep fried bone. And the extra, extra, extra breading they coat it with is completely bland and tasteless.  I think they should call it the NO SALT OR PEPPER pork chop.  I also ordered the Kung Pao chicken \"extra spicy please\".  Aside from a couple of stray peppers, the dish had zero heat.  It was also chock full of zucchini.  Loooooootttts of zucchini.  They should've called it Kung Pao Zucchini with a couple little pieces of dry chicken breast.  And this dish was not seasoned at all - nothin'.  No salt, not even a little MSG.  The only dish that was passable was the young chow fried rice.  Good enough, not oily, but once again completely underseasoned.    I give'em two stars because they seemed nice and fried rice was sorta ok.  I'm never calling them again."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and being from NY good Chinese food was everywhere.  However, we tried a cpl places here and were very disappointed.  I finally talked my boyfriend into trying China a GoGo and we were pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the honey walnut shrimp and he had the sesame chicken and everything was delicious!! I also love that the egg rolls are made w the thinner wrapper, we will definitely order from here again!! I can't wait to try the Thai entrees. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Great food with good comparable pricing and such a friendly staff. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was really good. My boyfriend and I came for dinner tonight and had a good experience. Not packed at all for a Saturday night! We were seated right away and the food came out pretty fast but was still fresh. The wait staff was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Just a brief review. The customer service of this place is -1 the food is cheap, typical American Chinese, and close to where I'm at. That's why they get a 2"}
{"text":"The food was cheap and really good! A really solid option for American Chinese food. We went after a long day of climbing at Red Rock Canyon and would say it is a must if you're looking for good, cheap food with large portions!"}
{"text":"I have been to two of their locations and I must say I'm impressed with their service and quality of food. Their dishes are beyond mediocre...I'm not saying their the best Chinese food restaurant in town but trust me when I say they are better than most. Everytime I enter their restaurant, I'm greeted. Their staff is incredibly polite.  There is no hassle when it comes to getting service.  I even notice that they customized an order for the customer after me. This is a great place for lunch specifically. They have great lunch specials that include a variety of entrees. Pay them a visit."}
{"text":"It's Americanized chinese food. Greasy, delicious, perfect way to sop up a hangover.   I'm hungover as balls, so I'm actually going here now to get delicious fried dumplings, then returning home to vomit and pass out on my floor."}
{"text":"The food is tasty delivery or order in. Always fast always hot always good. I've been here several times the staff is always polite and quick. The BBQ spare ribs  I would suggest trying the egg foo young as well. BBQ pork is delicious and juicy and tender."}
{"text":"This rating is for delivery only.  Trying to be \"healthy-ish\" since I'm supposed to be on a post-preggo diet, I  ordered the lettuce wraps and sauteed eggplant with tofu (which came with a side of rice).  The food was hot upon delivery and early!  even more importantly, the lettuce was fresh and crisp.  Taste-wise, it was a 5/5 for what it is: cheap Chinese at it's finest."}
{"text":"Don't recommend thought it would be good but highly disappointed chicken taste very weird so did the noodles the orange chicken and white rice were good but teriyaki chicken and chow mien were horrible ended up throwing it away teriyaki madness and panda are the way to go!"}
{"text":"Losee location, 9P.M.. Very good service. Friendly and attentive. Don't fool yourself, this is Americanized gloopy sauced fast food. This is not Spring Mountain. But it is good. The pot stickers are hand made and surprisingly good. The portions are large and very filling, very tasty. I only do this type of restaurant once or twice a year, but my wife and I came home with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"Called in for take out. There are not many good Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. They make your food to order. It is always made fresh to order. It's always hot. And the portion are large. They are polite on the phone. The kitchen is open. So you can see what they are cooking . Fast service,always fresh,made to order. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We order here once or twice a month. The delivery is fast and the guy is super friendly. My husband likes the Hong Kong crispy noodle. I've tried a few things, tonight I ordered the honey walnut shrimp. It's the closest I've had to the honey shrimp I had in Hawaii. I give a five because it's very good in that class of restaurant. Kinda fast food feel. Never the less foods good staff friendly."}
{"text":"Always my go to Chinese food place. They have not gotten my order wrong yet and food always fresh. Mmm BBQ sliced pork."}
{"text":"Later than dinner should be on a Friday night, Hubby & I headed down the hill to our neighborhood Chinese fast food spot. No longer China One, we had a bit of trepidation about this newcomer, China A GoGo. We shouldn't have been afraid - the hostess treated us royally & threw in an order of egg rolls, just so we could try them. Completed fresh, not oily, good quality of meat, fast, served with a smile... what more could I wish for?  Had plenty to take home for tomorrow's lunch and at a very reasonable price. Next time, if we're feeling it, we'll order in & eat in our pj's. For tonight, heading over there was a nice break from cooling off in the pool & listening to music. Nothing incredibly special, just the perfect meal for a chill Friday night. Thanks for taking the reins so aptly, China A GoGo!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. The food had no flavor. I ordered combination fried rice. The meat tastes old and smelled funny. The rice tasted so plain like no salt. The mustard chili sauce not only do they sell it on the side but it has no flavor either. I also noticed the prices are higher than the other China a GO Go I have gone. Will not ever be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. Place is dirty, food sucks and they have no customer service skills. It's a fast food Chinese joint, so I never expect much. Their prices are decent but not worth it. Yuck!"}
{"text":"In town visiting friends and came here for lunch today.  The sushi is delicious! Very fresh.  The staff was wonderful and took care of us! Definitely will come back here when I am in town again."}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese food and looked up places in Chinatown but most closed at 10pm or earlier so we were out of luck on a sit down place. We were looking for something like the Great Wall: old, dark lighting, booth seating, authentic, with great hot tea. We didn't see anything that fit the bill so we decided to eat in, because there's nothing I dislike more than eating at the newer Chinese restaurants with a tiny storefront and a couple of wooden tables to sit and eat. Since China GoGo is closest to us, and we've had their food before, we knew it would satisfy our food craving. In the past, delivery sometimes gets a bit mixed up, so we chose to pick up.    1. Ordered food around 9pm on Friday night, they said it would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes! Talk about quick service! Very impressed with that.  2. Arrived and the order was perfect, everything was packed. I appreciate their attention to detail. 5 stars for service, ease, attention to detail, & convenience   2. Ordered Family Dinner B and Combo noodles, chow mein, I think.   The fatter noodles, chow mein combo, it was greasier than I liked, but the chicken and shrimp were tender. It needed extra soy sauce, the flavor could definitely be amped up in their noodles, so that was a minus. I'd say 2.5 stars for the noodles. Not awful, not great.  I got the Shrimp with Snow Peas, my fave, the shrimp were tender, portion was huge and for fast food style Chinese, I was very happy. The dish had more flavor than the noodles. Came with white rice and the rice was done right. Overall, a 4 star for what it is.  Boyfriend got the Beef Hunan,,crispy spicy beef. He usually gets Mo Gillian Beef but doesn't like their version. Loves PF Chang's with green beans instead of onions. YUM! But not from China GoGo, so he tried something new to us both. I tasted it and was surprised, reminded me of a sweet/spicy friend boneless  chicken I've had before from somewhere, but can't remember where. It was flavorful;  too spicy though, if you really want spicy this isn't for you. The one problem is the cornstarch breaking had a weird mouthfeel. Don't know what that was about kind of chalky. I would give the dish a 3.5 stars for Hunan Beef. Again, the rice was good.  Corn egg flower Soup was included. It was bland, not as good as I've had before. 2.5 stars for the soup.   Family Dinner B Came with fried shrimp, eggrolls and crab Rangoon. We didn't get enough of the sweet dipping sauce, minus points. I had a nite of each, enjoyed the egg roll, the fried shrimp were crisp but greasy, the Rangoon were yummy. Overall score for these were 3.5, because we needed more sauce and the grease factor.   4) I give them 3.5 stars overall, better than a 3 for the service and convenience. They lost points for some blandness, sparse serving of dipping sauce  & too much grease of some dishes. However, the food seems fresh, the value is great. You get a LOT of food for your money. Our bill was $40 for everything, and I think this is what you expect when you want fast food Chinese!"}
{"text":"I ordered the honeydew boba and it came as a very icy slushie. Like they kind you would get from a gas station. It was very sweet and syrupy too. I also got the kung pow beef which didn't taste like I expected it to. I'm not sure how to describe it but it's not something I would eat again. The flavor isn't really exciting and the texture seems mushier than the kung pao beef I've had from other places. I don't think I would eat here again. I'm pretty disappointed. :( Try it if you want and decide for yourself, but it's just not what my taste buds were looking for."}
{"text":"So gross. Do not order any actual raw fish. I'm sure their cooked fancy rolls are fine but I've never seen or eaten less fresh fish in my life. Ugh. If I get food poisoning, I won't be surprised."}
{"text":"Very good and very cheap; but not the quality. Food is fast but very good and service is always great and friendly"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for some time and I must say- I love their food and staff are friendly. I recently ordered some party trays for a party I had this weekend and they delivered. Again all my guests enjoyed the food. For anyone who loves Chinese food - you need to check it out. My mom comes here atleast once a week and she loves it .  Did I mention they also have fresh sushi at the restaurant... I haven't tried it yet but I am betting it's  great too!"}
{"text":"it's a great place to eat and smells amazing the food is good specially they deliver,good place guys come and try it"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here it's just bad, so bland and dry. There are so many places you can spend your money with quality food."}
{"text":"ROACH IN FOOD.... If I could, I would give this place negative stars. My fiancée was craving Chinese food so we decided to go here since it is close.. We ordered in the store and got it to go. When we got home we were serving the food on plates and saw a roach in the fried rice. My daughter was already eating it, so I made sure she spit it out. We packed the food, and went back to the restaurant. When we got there we told the manager and they offered to make the food again, but as you may understand, we didn't want to eat there. They told us that has never happened before, unfortunately we won't be going back. Heads up!"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding quality food. The place is very clean and bright with both booths and tables. We had the Kung pao chicken which was very good but very spicy. We also had the string bean chicken which was very tasty and had big pieces of chicken in it. The food here is awesome."}
{"text":"I only have 1 star to give a review. I literally hung up and called right back because I forgot to add extra green onion. The man hung up on me twice then she he did get in the line which is less than 2 mins of me ordering he tells me the guy already left. I just had to cancel my order cause if it was out the door within 2 mins of me calling in that must be old rice and noodles. I was a regular at the one on green valley. Customer service was always good. This man makes me never want to order cause he had poor customer service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is always fresh and made in a timely manner. The portions are huge and usually last me 2 meals. Great food overall at a good price!"}
{"text":"Great food and service can't beat slice bbq and fried rice to die for it is always cook fresh egg roll is great"}
{"text":"I went to China A GoGo around dinner time on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty. They serve chips with sweet and sour sauce to start and one of the employees have us doughnuts on the house before our food was even ready.  I had the salt and pepper shrimp personal dinner, which was so much food for under $10. It comes with a soup, egg roll, crab Rangoon, half an order of shrimp and either white or fried rice. The serving was enough for two people. The shrimp was excellent, it was spicy and crispy. My party also got chow Kevin, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, and beef. All of our food exceeded expectations. For four people, our bill was around $50.  It is great to have such a nice place in that area with not a lot of food options up North! I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"We loved this place for so many years but it has really gone downhill. Overlooked or burned potstickers and overspiced food that has to be thrown out. What happened? It's so disappointing."}
{"text":"Always come to this restaurant! Staff is friendly and efficient! My food is always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I dont understand why the quality of food cannot be improved. The people working here should have to eat it also."}
{"text":"This chinese restaurant is the best. The food is great and the staff are pleasant. If you order food for pick up, they will put it a nice container and it's well presented. They give coupons too. They have it through mails like once a month. I got the 10 dollars off and they happily honored it. Save money while having good food."}
{"text":"So thrilled to have china a go go near us!! Tonight we went in to order, took about 15 minutes to get our food. We got home and realized that the food that was not supposed to have onions (my husband can't have them) was full of onions. We took it back and they were WONDERFUL about it. They remade the food that was wrong and gave us a sushi roll and Thai teas for our trouble. The apologized profusely and said next time to call and they would have delivered the corrected food. All the food was amazing! We had the asparagus chicken, the chicken lettuce wraps, the wor wonton soup, and the combination fried rice."}
{"text":"Went in after placing an online order and they hadn't received it yet.  The young man was very nice about it and basically put my order on right away.  Didn't even have to wait 10 minutes.  The food was excellent and so flavorful!!  It will definitely be our new go-to Chinese take-out place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese Food Restaurants!Great and fast service.Very satisfied with the food.Love their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"On the plus side, the service was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, the food wasn't very good. I ordered two dishes that I've had at several Chinatowns -- honey walnut shrimp and salt-and-pepper pork chops. The former had way too much breading on the shrimp and the sauce was overly sweet. The latter was better, but also had excessive breading and was light on spice. While I appreciated the great service, I've had better Chinese food at Panda Express.  If you're looking for inexpensive food that better quality than this place, go to Panda. If you want something more authentic, go to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times very good service and food was great great orange chicken  Bubba drinks are awesome   Def give it a try"}
{"text":"Always good.  Fast and great customer services. This is my place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"If you like your food extra salty due to the cooks picking their boogers while continuing to cook, this is the perfect place for you. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"I think I may have found my new spot for fast, fresh Chinese food.  I made the mistake of avoiding this place because it doesn't look very appealing from the outside. I'm glad I finally went in and gave it a try. There is a well balanced menu with lots of great options.  I was surprised by how quickly my food came out. It was served incredibly hot (the way I like it), even when I got the food home, there was steam rising from the box.  I tried the hot garlic chicken and subbed the mushrooms with jalapeños. I ordered it extra spicy because that's what I'm about. I tend to think places believe their food is spicy enough and ignore my request. Not this place. My food was wonderfully spicy and full of robust flavor.  I definitely recommend getting the individual meal, it costs a little more money but it's worth it. Along with your meal you get a pretty big serving of soup and two delicious spring rolls.  I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Oh I'll be back.. Try and stop me."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem!   Great food and fantastic service.  Lunch special and sushi were amazing.  We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I will never ever eat here again! Can't believe what I'm reading and seeing! Then to read you would not make things right?!? Not good! The health department should be on your door step!"}
{"text":"Shit service. The lady I spoke to was hard to communicate with. Once I was able to submit my order they gave me a 10 minute delivery ETA. It took them literally 1hr 20min to drop off my food. Never again will I order from here. No sense of urgency.."}
{"text":"First Time here and walked in and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. The place was clean and the food looks awesome. Best Chinese takeout  I've found in Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"very good food,  so delicious,  if you want really quick and yummy Chinese food, here is your place"}
{"text":"The food is good and they have it ready in like 5 minutes, sometime that can freak me out because why is the food getting done so fast.  And some reason the restaurant has and nasty odor so I usually get my food on the go."}
{"text":"Been here 3 time already the employees have been very friendly and the food has always been really good always fresh and great flavor they are also pretty quick at making the food five stars forsure!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Ordered through yelp, paid with tip and they state they never got the order or got paid, yet my account shows it was paid"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were feeling lazy so we wanted to have some food delivered. Our usual spot was about a 2 hour wait and we were starving so we found this place. We called, ordered a decent amount of food, and it turned out to be around $40 with tip for about a full meal for two. A little pricey for delivery Chinese. The deliver was quick because it's only a few miles from our house. When the order arrived, the man took the money and left as quick as possible, leaving no time for us to inspect the order to make sure it was correct. Which of course, was missing several pieces to it. For the price and lack luster flavor, I probably wouldn't order here again. Most of the food we ordered was supposed to come with sauces on the side (orange sauce to dip chicken, sweet and sour sauce to dip chicken, hot oil, etc) and the sauce was missing so most of our meal was plain unflavored chicken/food."}
{"text":"OKAY WELL FIRST OFF....THEY'RE SO RUDE!  We had went in to order a family meal and boba. My friend had ordered a side of steamed rice and the cashier guy did not not jot down the order. He just looked at my friend with an attitude. We figured it was just because it was busy. We appreciated them taking our order and tipped them.  We don't live long ways from this restaurant so we went home to eat our dinner. The steam white rice was not in there so we decided to call so that they can deliver two orders of steam white rice and orange chicken. I first call them and they were just plain rude. I told the guy twice that we wanted it to be delivered. I was not able to give our address because he hung up. I called again to give him our address. The second time I called because I was concerned that he didn't have our gate code. He interrupted, \"we already have your address in the computer\". I repeated myself stating that I was trying to give him the gate code because it changed from last time. He stated that they were busy and hung up automatically.  Then I called a fourth time because we waited for more than an hour for our food to be delivered. The lady picked up and I told her that I had wanted to cancel my order. She said that the guy was on the way to deliver our food. I told her that I wanted to cancel our food because we waited for a long time for it to be delivered. She then stated that the food was ready there at the restaurant. Meaning that the guy was not on his way. She asked if we would like to cancel our order. And I said yes.   Apparently, we are no longer able to order food from this place because we canceled an order that took more than an hour to make. They were rude to us and had poor customer service. I don't understand why this business is even open or why those two workers are still employed."}
{"text":"We were so pleasantly  surprised at the high quality of food at this small restaurant next to an Albertsons Grocery Store in Henderson . I wanted to check it out since it's convenient to my home. The sushi and sashimi were amazing! I also checked into ordering large sushi platters for a party that I am giving and they were most accommodating! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Came here after long afternoon of driving around town and needed a quick dinner. Chinese is usually a safe choice, so I figured, \"why not?\"   Ordered the combination chow mein. Sat down and within 4 minutes my order was ready. Not bad, especially considering I was starving!   Got home and started to dig in. Sadly, I was disappointed by the taste. The chow mein was very bland and greasy. Nothing to write home about which is such a shame because I live right around the corner and would have frequented the place a lot more.   Fast service is a plus but when the food doesn't live up to expectations its hard to give this place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty, good price and good service! Perfect when you're craving Chinese. They deliver also!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese I have had in a long time!! Highly recommend. String bean chicken was perfect. The all white meat melts in your mouth and the black pepper chicken is the best I've had ever! And the delivery guy was very polite. Beats Panda Express any day! Well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. I really came in with low expectations and left satisfied. Mainly the skepticism came from a chinese food place selling sushi. I tried the ayce (all you can eat) deal as did my wife and i thought the food was worth what we paid. The  rolls arent anything fancy but i thought the rolls were good and it was great bang for the buck.   Bottom line: i wouldn't drive out of my way to come here but if you live within a five mile radius its a place worth checking out if you craving sushi and don't feel like driving into the city."}
{"text":"I've been to two of their locations and I have to say this one is so dirty and disgusting. The food was good. But at my visit there one of the employees was sitting at a table eating out of the metal bowls they use to toss the food in. When he was finished it looked like he just put it back on the counter to be used again!!! Really?!? It made me sick to my stomach!! I got the honey walnut shrimp which was good but left a weird film in my mouth and had a very strange sourish \"sauce\" in the bottom of the to go box. I probably will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch!!! I work close by and order to go often. They always have huge portions, especially for the price (around $6), the veggies are always fresh and cooked just right with a little snap to them, and they are very generous. I've ordered the cashew chicken lunch special and was amazed how many cashews were included. The chicken teriyaki bowl is one of my favorites!! To the people who compare this to Panda Express, YOU ARE CRAZY!! China a Go Go is way cheaper for a lot more food... and so much fresher. Also, it doesn't give me a stomach ache and headache like PE, probably the MSG. I've dined in one time and had great service. You wouldn't know it from the outside but the restaurant is quite nice.   The only con is you have to order \"to go\" and \"delivery\" through GrubHub. Although I haven't had a problem with the orders, now that they have my address I get spam from them."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly and courteous. The food is very hot and fresh and always tasty."}
{"text":"I've had an overall tough-go at uncovering a decent Chinese food spot outside of Chinatown but this particular China-a-Go-Go was impressive. I ordered delivery and my Chicken Kung Pao was seriously awesome. They also arrived less than 30 minutes after I ordered which is record timing for delivery of anything other than craptacular Domino's pizza.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the spice was right on and the Corn Flower soup was amaze! Will definitely hit this place up again when the craving calls."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. Really good food. Slightly expensive though compared to others. I don't mind it as long as it's good. The person in the cashier, though, needs a little more customer service training, I guess.   I love their House Special Chicken aka Gen Tso's Chicken and my husband their Singapore Noodles.  Actually, everything is good."}
{"text":"Decent food and great prices. You can get two entree's, rice, soup, and appetizers for less than $30 on a family meal. Wide variety of choices plus delivery. We will be ordering again soon. Thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"The Egg Foo Young is delicious.  The shrimp in lobster sauce is too runny and needs more seasoning.  Lobster sauce should be thick.  Their idea of noodles is not thin like lomein but rather is a thick spaghetti which I don't like.  The spring roll was good.  The fried rice had good flavor.  Price is a little high, but I get delivery which takes about an hour to get because they cook the Egg Foo Young to order."}
{"text":"This place is a convenient go-to restaurant for me and my family and we love it for a quick bite. The food is always prepared promptly and the portions are large. We always get the Pad Thai and the Singapore Noodles and every time they're prepared perfectly. Great food, great sizes, fast service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, roommate and I have ordered from this Chinese restaurant pretty often however it seems like the customer service has gone down tremendously . The food is always great but the people are very rude over the phone and rush you and do not let you finish your order. It's almost as if you are bothering them by calling in for delivery.  Usually when we order $60 worth of food they offer free pot stickers however this last order they were very rude when we asked if it came with it. I'm spending $60 and have ALWAYS gotten them........When they come to the door they are very sassy and rude as well. Based on how they have acted the past few times we've ordered from them, the order I just placed might be my last unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese delivery. Ordering it on my lazy Sunday's has become sort of a tradition. I always get the Sesame Chicken or Sweet and Sour Chicken. The noodles are ok but I prefer the fried rice. It's delicious!!! And the best part is they deliver fast with no minimum purchase required."}
{"text":"Second time to this location. In the winter it's completely cold. In the summer it's sweaty hot. The food is the only thing that brought me back. The service (or lack of) likely will keep me away. Large orders of food come out at different times. Today my Paper Wrapped Chicken was RAW! Sadly this has made my experience so poor I likely won't be returning. They aren't any better than Panda Express. Feel free to disagree. This is just my opinion."}
{"text":"Take out was not as good of an experience. I called in for pick up at 11:09am. I said I needed an 11:30am pick up. They said they could make that work. My husband sat waiting 20 additional minutes for our to go order."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to eat sushi, plus, they just started serving all-you-can-eat! They are just around the corner from us and Henderson is lacking in Asian cuisine, but they're still just as good as any sushi restaurant I've been to. They even have a few unique menu items I haven't seen elsewhere. Also, they serve Boba--boba, in downtown Henderson! I don't have to drive all the way to Green Valley now. And it's good Boba, too. Oh, and they deliver, cater, and they have friendly staff. I am happy, very happy."}
{"text":"New to the area and have been looking for good sushi. Someone at our gym suggested China A Gogo, we tried it and liked it very much. The people are so nice and the food is good. Been back a few times, writing this review makes me hungry. I think I will go there now"}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice little restaurant in a strip mall by Albertson's grocery store. I was expecting a Chinese pick-up place, instead I found it very nice clean little restaurant who also does pick-up. I had sushi and it was very fresh."}
{"text":"The Crab Rangoon's and Sesame Beef were good. However, the beef and chicken fried rice weren't good. Also, we got it to go, but didn't get offered silverware."}
{"text":"Came with my very picky boyfriend and he loved it!Very clean, friendly and attentive workers. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place all the time. The food is very good. Orange chicken and Thai food are excellent.  Well the family loves it, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great for delivery or dine in! Best place for quick service and decent Chinese-American food. Family faves include SN5-Pad Ke Meo and B8-Beef Sting Bean. Been a loyal customer since they opened and we also enjoy their Valle Verde location too. Although, this location has Japanese food/sushi, I prefer their original menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a lot of porting... Love the chow mien and the broccoli beef. They also have amazing costumer service. Will definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and it has been delicious each time. I love the wor won ton soup and the Mongolian beef. They are still getting the feel of the town so if there are any problems they are happy to fix them. Staff is very nice. Will continue to eat here:)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite delivery places ! I really like their food always fresh so far all the different dishes I've tried I liked except the teriyaki chicken .. Not saying it's not good I just didn't care for it much .. I will use them over and over !"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Vegas so far. I will definitely come again and I recommend this place to others"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly was clean location easy to find , the food was very good beef chowmein combination fried rice thai tea :) good and affordable"}
{"text":"My first time here although we have lived in the area for a while. I must admit the negative reviews got to me.   Anyway, came in today to order lunch to go. This place is really tiny! They had 4 booths and 2 tables for 2. The ladies at the register were nice and the kitchen crew was rocking(a good sign). Ordered mixed chow mien, Mongolian beef lunch special and a taro boba to-go. We were in and out in less than 15mins. The boba was so good and refreshing. The Mongolian beef was \"WOW!\", the mixed chow mien had so much meat and shrimps and so yummy, the servings are huge. Price is very affordable too. We're good for lunch and dinner:).  Kicking myself for waiting this long to check this place out. This is now my go-to place whenever I'm craving Chinese food.  Food and service, 5 stars. Wish the place was bigger but heck I don't really care about that."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for the reasons I always choose to come back to establishments. These are clean, excellent prompt service, great food, and friendly staff.  I chose the choose any 6 sushi sampler plate. It came quickly, was presented well, and tasted excellent. Very fresh and delicious! Good job China a go go!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hot garlic chicken and the spice on it was perfect. The fried rice was really good as well. My boyfriend got the Mongolian chicken and the spice on his was really good too.  His mom got the frying Jason and midnight. Both were really good. The midnight was the best. The only thing I'd add is the staff doesn't speak English so that's hard. Also if you go to the one in Boulder City and then this one the menus are different."}
{"text":"The Vegas roll is really good. The fried rice is pretty bland. They do have really good lunch specials as well. I'm sure this place will put China Bistro out of business which sucks for them.  If you are going to sit down expected it to be busy."}
{"text":"Service was fast. Food was fresh, hot, and tasty!  They threw in free egg rolls!  If you are looking for a lot of options and good food...then you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Not as good as other China a gogos around town.  Lady was fidgeting with nonsensical tasks even after her boss pointed to me and said \"she will take your order\".  Longest wait ever at any China a gogo.  Hot garlic chicken was way too sweet.  No soup for dining in.  Bagged up my order when I asked politely for \"for here\" and my request was flat out ignored.  This restaurant is lucky there is a lack of decent spots close by."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since I love Chinese food. I had the kung pao chicken, and noodles. The food is bland, nothing like you could get at Chinatown."}
{"text":"My expectations for a rice bowl at a quick Chinese food place are pretty low. Typically you get a bowl of mostly rice with just enough goodies (veggies or whatever) to cover the rice. And the goodies are generally over-cooked. Surprise, surprise at the Boulder City China a Go Go! Had to dig thru the generous serving of veggies (it was a veggie bowl) to find the steamed rice below. (Not a complaint, btw.) And the veggies were fresh, firm, and flavorful! Must have been cooked to order, instead of sitting in a steamer since morning. Plus! the rice bowl was not a lonely dish. It was served with a very tasty salad (excellent house dressing!) and a wonderful bowl of miso soup. Truly a luxury experience with a fast food price!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, consistent, fresh every time. Always on the ball. Just know they love to throw the ginger on so know what you ordering."}
{"text":"Its hard to go wrong with China A-Go-Go. You get a lot of good food for the price. I like to go in for lunch. You get fried noodles, a cup of soup, rice, chow mein and an entree. It is very nearly too much for me to eat. I never really know what I am going to get until I sit down and look at the menu. Everything I've had has been great. This lastest visit I ordered the hot garlic chicken. It wasn't terribly hot though it could have been. I must have pulled out at least a dozen of those wicked hot peppers like you find in kung pow. I could have probably launched myself to the moon had I eaten those.  Its not just lunch I get when I come here. I stop in for dinner from time to time as well. Some of my favorites for dinner are chow fun noodles and mu shu chicken. The egg foo young is also really good. I eat it and I don't usually care for egg foo young.   I've been going to various China A-Go-Go restaurants for years. This location at Boulder Highway and Lake Mead is my third regular go-to and demonstrates the same quality I am accustomed to at the others. For quick Chinese at a good price, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for lunch. The service was fast and the food was good. Huge lunch portions! Yummy fried rice! We didn't eat inside but it looked clean when we went in. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Come here once a week for lunch it's great  I always get the beef fried rice I wish the portions were smaller though"}
{"text":"I was in the other day and ordered 2 lunch specials.  The girl who took the order was eating, got up, put her hands under the water...no soap and proceeded.  Once she took my order the cooks who were sitting down who were also eating, again put their hands under the water...no soap.  That is against health code and knowing they were cited for dirty dining in the past I don't think I want to go back."}
{"text":"I got the Chinese eggplant with tofu. Atmosphere is nice enough. Price is great and food is good american-chinese. Solid four stars."}
{"text":"Took a shot in the dark. This place has been open for years. By far the #NASTIEST so called \"Chinese\" food I've ever encountered. I paid $12 for a Dinner Combo which included Mongolian Beef (Only 8 thin Pieces of Meat) should be called Mongolian Green Pepper and Chow Mein (Lo-Mein) no flavor whatsoever. Taste like Grocery Store packaged Udon Noodles w no flavor. The food here is so gross my dog wouldn't even eat it, and I have a Pug, and Pugs eat EVERYTHING! So if you want to waste your money and still be hungry after throwing away your meal, this is your go to spot. If not, youd be better off spending your hard earned money at neighboring restaurants that are far MUCH better."}
{"text":"When i say China A Go Go is a go go... The BEST Chinese take out I've had since moving to Vegas!!! OMG!!   We ordered the family dinner with wonton soup (amazing and so flavorful) combination rice (full of LARGE shrimp and oh so good) lemon chicken (tasted like orange BUT still very good) and Kung Pow combination  (again full of shrimp). The dinner also came with 2crab ragoon, 2fried shrimp, 2egg rolls and fortune cookies....."}
{"text":"The food is always good at China A Go Go on Loose Rd, the service is always great for both takeout and delivery this is one of my favorite spots cuz they're quick. I would highly recommend China go go for those who want something to eat fast and good Chinese this is it!"}
{"text":"Best low main ever have big portion size also enough for leftovers  fav Chinese place ever!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé order from here a couple times a month. Food is always on point and consistent. Mongolian Beef is spicy and delicious!!  The Salt and Pepper shrimp are really good too. Everytime we order they always give you something for Free like donuts or a free drink. Nice people that work here. Their attitude is always very friendly. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting this place. The first one was a nice experience as i feel like the lady who was helping me was very polite and helpful. I also find their lunch meal good.. tasted ok, huge proportions and good price.   We decided to come back to try the other entree on etheir lunch menu but the lady refuse to serve me their lunch special coz accrdg to them its only offered from 11am to 4pm. The,receipt showed she punched my order at 403pm. A 3 minute diff and she choose to disappoint a customer. This cost me about $10 more to wat i was gona pay for their lunch menu but wat upset me is that they choose to disappoint rather than accommodate. Also charging me $2.50 extra to change steamed rice to fried rice is ridiculous.  Oh and while im writing this review im drenched in sweat, this place nneeds a better airconditioning specially when its 110F outside its very warm and uncomfortable in here.  Im giving them 3stars id say more of 2.5 averaging 2 visits :)   Should i come back to this place? maybe... when im nearby and im craving for some chinese food. Oh and also if its around 11am to 4pm :)"}
{"text":"I have tried many Chinese resturuants in Henderson, and so far I have found most to be average, or slightly above average, at best (some are down right awful). China A Gogo falls into the slightly above average category, and I would rate it 3 1/2 stars. I have eaten there many times (not because I love it, but because it is close to my house, and there really is no better place near to me). Prices are reasonable and portions are good (however, if you order one of their shrimp dishes, they do use smaller shrimp than what is standard....although they seem to try to give you more shrimp than normal, to try and make up for the smaller size). The bottom line is, if you want some quick Chinese food, and don't feel like driving to Vegas, you can get an inexpensive decent meal at China A Gogo....but I am still hoping, that one day, someone will open a real good New York style Chinese Resturuant in Henderson."}
{"text":"We wanted to order from somewhere that delivered so we chose here. I had the sautéed garden vegetables with chow mein noodles instead of rice, which was nice to have as an option. Hubby had the Singapore noodles which was had interesting flavors but he loved it. Both were huge portions and we got 2 meals out of it. We also ordered the eggs rolls to start.   It was pretty standard Chinese as most places but for the price, delivery option and huge portions it sets this place apart. I'd give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER COME to this place! I odered 3 large fried rice for the price of $26bux and ask for more forks and chop stick because it would be 10 of us eating sharing, but the guy said we can only get 6. Terrible place. I always order large amount of food when going to Chinese food but this is the only place that said to me that you can only have 6? Wtf?!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in a town where it is hard to find it. Great quality Chinese food, super fast, and never too much msg. Love the chicken skewers"}
{"text":"Very friendly, nice staff here. They make sure your taken care of. Food is so yummy love it ! My family and I come here all the time !"}
{"text":"Good Chinese fast food.... They deliver also! But it's better to call in then pick it up food is always ready in10 min or less.... Delivery usually takes 45 min to an hour...The workers are friendly and always greets me when I enter. The prices are good for the meal. Try the different bobas it's good.... So far my favorite is the lychee boba. I like the mapo tofu... Or the honey walnut shrimp... Not a big dam with the potstickers... The wrap on it is way tooo thick... But other than that I'm pretty satisfied!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great service good food inexpensive and they hussle to get you out on togo orders."}
{"text":"The food is always good in everyone here is so nice. They have locations all over town with great prices"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you want fresh cooked chinese food. The people that work here are very friendly and are chinese, it looks like it's family owned but not entirely sure.  Most of the times I usually get their lunch special orange chicken. It's really good and cheap for the amount you get! Which is a lot of orange chicken and white rice in an entree box. There was only one time they messed up on my order, they forgot to put my potstickers when I ordered takeout, but I just called them and they said I could come pick it up again or just come back the next day for a refund. Since it was late I picked it up the next day.  Other than that, they have good chinese food if you want it quick but good quality. The fact that it is cooked fresh in front of you once you order it is a good thing, nothing like panda express where they have their food sitting out in the open under the heat. What's also important is that the staff keeps the place clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. This is my new go to place for Chinese. The service is good. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was good until I found 2 chicken bones in my orange chicken... It's fresh, but it doesn't make up for complacency. Be very careful what you eat"}
{"text":"Today was the second time we ordered takeout from this location since this new restaurant has been here ( formerly China One). Our first experience was very good. We had wonton soup and chicken with asparagus both times. The first time the wonton soup was good and this time the wontons were soggy. The chicken dish had white breast meat the first time and thigh meat this time. We weren't sure if the dish was even cooked fresh. We were disappointed to say the least with our dinner tonight. I hope our next dinner there will be better. It will be a while before we return. The staff is friendly and the manager was a nice gentleman when I met him our first time around."}
{"text":"Best Chinese fast food food yet. I order the lunch specials daily and always found them to be delicious. I have tried curry beef and chicken, kung pao chicken. Recently discovered the Mongolian beef and now I really like that one, reminds me of Korean / teriyaki bbq. Good value for the money and fills you up. Low salt and no msg. The lunch specials are from 11-4 daily but I have called a little before or after and no problem still ordering. Odd though there is a large sign outside for 10% off for happy hour 1-3pm. When I ask the clerk about the discount he said they no longer have that. Guess they are more focused on food? Try to get the 10% off if you can!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Definitely the BEST Chinese food in North Las Vegas!!! Ive been to a lot of places around town and have not found a place as authentic as this one. The staff is very kind and the food is awesome and prepared in a timely manner. If you're looking for good Chinese food , this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered combination fried rice, orange chicken, & beef and broccoli. portions are amazingly big. The combination fried rice was delicious, orange chicken was to sweet for my taste buds and the beef and broccoli was amazing. this was a delivery order it took aprozimately 20-30 minutes for delivery. the deliver person was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and It's hit or miss.  The sushi is pretty decent and Fresh. They are weird and pricey when it comes to special requests.  The boba tea is great. The second time I had it it want blended well but the taro and Bob's flavor made up for it. I also orders a tofu dish. It was way too oily.  Sometimes the service is Really Sweet sometimes bitter"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered delivery.  And the address was off by a number and they couldn't even call us to say anything.  We waited an hour and a half for our food. I've had plenty of delivery drivers call us to say they can't find my house or they are on their way, not them. If we didn't call them we wouldn't have ever known. Then first we ask to still get our food since it's paid for and they said ok. Then they call back and say the manager doesn't want to deliver our food. And we had to call eat24 to get our money back."}
{"text":"The best egg foo young ever!!! Not like wanna be eggfoo young that's a frozen Patty soaked in a deep  fat fryer. They make it from scratch, and the sauce is amazing made to order. I love this place"}
{"text":"Service used to be great. They would come within the time they said they would. Now they take an extra 20 minutes past the expected time and the bags smell like cigarette smoke because the driver couldn't wait during the 2 mile drive to my house. Called to just let the staff know but kept getting asked if the food showed up...yes (I had thought). Turned out when I actually opened the bags and washed the stench from my hands I was not missing one but TWO items and the combination rice did not have a single shrimp in it. Thanks for nothing. I won't be ordering from here twice a month anymore. Will be expecting a refund"}
{"text":"OMG!! Super fast delivery. Super hot and fresh food...the food was  I definitely will make this place my go to"}
{"text":"This location is always so fast and so kind. I came here after a hard day at school and was greeted with good attitudes and smiles all around. Thanks to the staff for making my day better!"}
{"text":"Yummy food that's prepared quickly (but done to order, fresh). We ordered takeout on a Friday night, and it was ready in under ten minutes. Great customer service. Lots of food for the price: we ordered Family Dinner B and had enough for two other meals (and we're big eaters). The kung pao combo was a big hit, in particular. Plus, they gave us donuts on the house! Highly recommend. Will be returning. Thank you!"}
{"text":"8/12/17 I Order the personal dinner with orange chicken . IT WASNT worth the MONEY . The orange chicken didnt have enough flavor it seem like frozen food and wasnt fresh . The egg roll was smell and it was vegetable and I asked for one with meat . The delivery guy was nice & polite . He arrived a few mintues early"}
{"text":"Dam good stuff ...epic fast ... a bit saucy .. but super tasty !!!!! Will be back forsure"}
{"text":"Placed and order for delivery. I was told it would take 45 minutes, 20 minutes later there was a knock on our door.  We ordered Mongolian beef, sesame flavored chicken wings, and chicken pad thai. Everything was DELISH.  The veggies were crisp and tasted fresh. The noodles weren't overcooked and mushy as is often the case with pad thai. Overall very happy.  I will be ordering from here again....very soon."}
{"text":"So me & my boyfriend were too lazy to cook tonight so we decided to order out. Once I ordered, it said it would be about an hour for delivery. They actually came in 25 minutes which I was surprised by! The gentleman said they weren't too busy tonight. I was a little disappointed when I couldn't add a tip to the card upon arrival of the food. So I felt bad that I didn't have cash either. Once I got my food opened, one of the boxes of orange chicken had a hair right on the top. Kind of disappointing. But the other food was great!"}
{"text":"2.5 STARS    In the future, this China Go Go location looks like it will be a China No Go. I left extremely disappointed.     First, I felt they overcharged me. If the pepper steak lunch special is $6.89 and a Coke is $1.50, how did it end up $9.70? But, why sweat over the small stuff? You live once. However, the big stuff was that the food wasn't good. In all honesty, the Chinese food I eat in a Feast Buffet is better.    A red flag that the quality was lacking here was when the egg drop soup was placed on my table a couple of minutes after sitting down, with the pepper steak immediately after. Please give me time to enjoy the soup. Yeah, the food came fast. But it was lacking in quality and reminded me more of fast food than a good Chinese restaurant.     In recent times I have been to several Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I can tell the difference in quality just from the pepper steak. The peppersteak here was lacking in the flavor and ingredients that I have been accustomed to lately in the Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. For example XO Chinese Restaurant down the road and China Wan Wan on Boulder Highway, served me pepper steak that would make me drive out of my way to have it. Here, the pepper steak was lacking flavor and pieces of it had a rubbery taste. Here, the fried rice lacked flavor where down the road XO served some of the finest fried rice that I have had in Las Vegas. And the chow mein noodles that seemed to take up over a third of the styrophone bowl was filler that lacked flavor. It was nothing like the lo mein noodles side that Chop Stix on Mark's Street in Henderson recently served me with far superior pepper steak. Even the chow mein noodles at Panda Express is far better. Finally, the Coke tasted funky and I would pour it out and complement the food with Mr Pibb.    Customer service is also lacking here. I remember the people working in the Locosee Road China Go Go being personable. And the people working in the Alicante Parkway and the Windmill Parkway China Go Go's were nicer workers serving better food.    In the future this China Go Go is a China No Go for at least a year.  There are far better Chinese restaurants and better China Go Go's for me to spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Not every China A Go Go is created equal. There locations range from \"so so\" to really good. This China A Go Go is over and above the China A So So category. Their humongous portions of flavorful food elevates it to the greatest China A Go Go that I have been to in the Las Vegas valley.       After a hiking adventure in the nearby Lake Mead National Recreation Area, I was up to treating myself to China A Go Go. So, from the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, I cruised down Lake Mead Parkway and made a right turn at the Albertson's-anchored shopping center on the northeast corner of Boulder Highway.     In my opinion if you make it to a China A Go Go before 4 o' clock, it is good timing. They offer their lunch menu up to that time. From my experiences at their locations, I learned that they excel at shrimp chop suey over other dishes such as pepper steak. Right off the bat, after perusing the window menu, I expected to exchange $7.25 for the shrimp chop suey lunch special plus an additional couple of dollars on a fountain drink.      In contrast to the past couple of China A Go Go restaurants that I dined in, this location is a full-service restaurant just like the restaurant on Windmill at Bermuda. Missing here is ordering from a take out counter and an employee bringing the food to the table in a styrofoam dish. Upon stepping inside, the woman by the door led me to a booth and presented me with a menu.     The lunch commenced with complimentary crunchy noodles with duck sauce. The exact soup of the day for the past ten years: egg drop soup soon followed. The egg drop soup served in a china plate was hot and flavorful. The waiter had poured my soda into the glass. During the course of the meal he would volunteer to refill it. When the china plate of shrimp chop suey, fried rice, and soft chow mein noodles arrived I knew that I would be leaving full. The portion was humongous and delicious. The soft chow mein noodles exceeded my expectation of filler. In contrast to some China A Go Go's there was texture and flavor to them. Ditto for the fried rice. Now the shrimp Chop Suey was the bomb. The presentation from the mixture of the diverse and warm vegetables interspersed with a sundry of shrimp was to my taste buds that a few minutes ago Lake Mead National Recreation Area was to my eyes: delightful.       In conclusion, not every China A Go Go or chain restaurant is created equal. I hold a higher opinion of this China A Go Go than the other locations I have dined in."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: Outstanding Shrimp Chop Suey      From dining in the sundry of Chinese restaurants in Southern Nevada, I noticed that some Chinese restaurants shine in certain areas. For example, XO Chinese Restaurant on Blue Diamond shines in their exceptional egg rolls. A second example is that New York Chinese Restaurant shines in their New York style chow mein. And a third example is that the China Go Go chain shines in their shrimp chop suey. It was a yearning for their exceptional chow mein that delivered me to their newest location in the Boulder City Albertson's shopping center a couple of shops from Starbuck's.       When I was in Boulder City this previous Sunday, I was decided on trying the new China Go Go. It is so new that if I reviewed China Bistro last year, I'd write that it is the only Chinese restaurant in Boulder City excluding Panda Express.       In some of my Chinese restaurant reviews I stated that the Chinese lunch specials are some of the best dining deals around. China Go Go is evidence that this holds true. During lunch til 4 pm they serve lunch specials ranging from $7.25 to $7.95. The lunch specials include crunchy noodles with mustard, bowl of egg drop soup, chow mein noodles, and fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey lunch combination for $7.95 plus a glass of Coke $1.49 that came out to $10.21 before the tip.      Not all China Go Gos are created equal. I have dined in a few that were take out style paper plate dining restaurants (e.g. Bermuda at Windmill, Durango at Warm Springs, and Valle Verde). This location is full service. Full decent service. When I walked in the host that became my server told me to sit anywhere. It was underwhelming to pick a table since it is small. The way the restaurant is set up the tables are to the right of the kitchen where there is a blind spot in watching the creation of the dish. As far as service, it was the experience where the server placed the essentials of the meal on the clean table. There wasn't the luxury of the server asking me if I wanted my half empty fountain beverage refilled.     The meal started off with crunchy noodles with mustard. A room for improvement is including duck sauce with the crunchy noodles. The crunchy noodles were a good introduction to the food that was going to follow. Next up was the egg drop soup which I believe they name egg flower soup here. Nonetheless it tasted similar to the egg drop soup that has been the common soup of the day for the past ten or so years. Psychologically the colorful bowl it was served in made it more delectable. Finally, the plate with fried rice, chow mein noodles, and shrimp chop suey arrived. In my opinion chow mein noodles are filler food to occupy a quarter of the dish. Some restaurants pull off serving tasty chow mein noodles that can pass for lo mein. Not China Go Go where the chow mein noodles are China so so. The fried rice was good. The truth about fried rice is that it is nearly impossible to mess up. But, the shrimp chop suey that occupied half the plate was outstanding. The chef provided the perfect balance between the vegetables, sauce, and shrimp. Interspersed between the savory vegetables were a generous portion of shrimp. This was flavorful shrimp that outshined the peeled shrimp that I have ate in the buffets. The China Go Go lunch experience concluded with a fortune cookie and check. My fortune cookie might as well have said, \"You will soon be writing a three star review.\""}
{"text":"Plain and Simple- Fresh and easy Chinese food to go. It was one of the first open in the area of our house and its good. Takes a little while but you know its wok'd fresh. Kung Pao and Mongolian is the bomb. House Lo Mein is awesome.  Theres another one in North Las Vegas we go to as well near my parents house. This one is slightly better in my opinion."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Chinese restaurant experience I've had to date in Las Vegas the entire time I've been living here (9 years) ...   I ordered the orange chicken which firstly, I don't freaking understand why they lazily separate the sauce from the cooked breaded chicken. Not only do they separate the sauce, they give you such a small portion. This means taste wise the chicken is not covered in enough sauce. The breading chicken have no absolute taste. 100 percent bland !! No spices and no salt ! Zero salt, it tasted terrible!   The second thing I ordered was salt and pepper fried shrimp ... now I'm of Asian decent and have always ordered a plethora of Asian/Chinese dishes my whole life... and I was so disappointed that there was absolutely no SALT on the shrimp, not to mention the quality of the shrimp was poor. It tasted very old and very very fishy, tell tale sign of old seafood. But honestly how can you advertise this dish with \"salt\" in the actual name and there isn't any at all??   The pork fried rice actually also had no SALT?? Everything was the most blandest no flavor food I've ever had in my entire life. Worst Chinese restaurant in Vegas.   I don't understand how Chinese people that grew up eating Chinese home cooked food could serve this kind of quality food they did not grow up on themselves?!  If you eat here be prepared to load your food with soy sauce and siracha to make it edible at most."}
{"text":"Wow! I love the food here. I have only lived in Henderson for a short while & am so happy I discovered this place. They have a huge menu... Which I like so there is something for everyone! Plus they do it well... Everything I've had has been delicious- wonton soup w/seafood, Kung-pao chicken, hot & sour soup & my favorite.... Phad Kee Mao - yum!!! I've had this dish at some of the best Thai places in Vegas & Dallas, and I have to say... China a go go has the best!!!  I have not dined in here only take out, and its sooooo good! I've ordered take out from here about 7 times."}
{"text":"Update: Good Chinese food in Hendertucky doesn't really exist. Trust me, I've tried every single place I can find on Yelp for East Henderson / Water Street, and more often than not I end up thinking what the heck do people see in these places? China-A-Go-Go is one of the few places that seems to get it right every time I order from them.   I'm not going to give them more than 3 Stars because I still think they are overpriced. Case in point, if you want fried rice with your entree, they charge $2.50 for it...per entree. Seriously? I know restaurants run on thin margins these days, but come on, this is a bit steep. Actually I find it to border on ridiculous, and I've told the staff as much.   That being said if you want Kung Pao Chicken that has more than 2 teeny tiny peppers in it for example, or Sweet and Sour chicken that has more chicken than rice, you'll want to give China-A-Go-Go a try."}
{"text":"The bae and I ordered the family dinner A. The lady at the counter is VERY accommodating to my boyfriends needs. He always seems to complicate things when we eat out. Anyway!  Dinner A; comes with egg rolls (2), crab rangoons (2), soup of your choice, rice of your choice and two entrees of your choice.  My boyfriend wanted to replace the two egg rolls with two more crab rangoons. The lady was very sweet and said I'll give you the egg rolls for free. And she also added four more crab rangoons for free. So we had six crab rangoons in total. How sweet of her??? There were also two entrees to choose from. I picked the Mongolian beef and of course my boyfriend wanted something else that wasn't on the list of entrees. He asked if he can get the teriyaki chicken entree instead. And that's what he got! You can also choose from white rice or BBQ pork fried rice. Obviously, I got the BBQ pork fried rice (If you haven't seen my pictures yet.) and lastly we got the egg drop soup. Yum!!! One of my choosings!!! I also ordered my thai tea.   Now, I've been fasting for the last week or so. So I only eat at night! #carbnite I'm not sure if it was because I haven't ate all day but damn, the Mongolian beef was good :p and the soup and the teriyaki chicken and everything else. I definitely was satisfied! Especially the amount of food that was given. We had leftovers... Well, the bae had left overs. He finished everything by that night. I was so full. I couldn't eat anymore! And I almost forgot... The Thai tea. If you know me, I like thai tea a lot. But this one not so much. It lacked flavor. So I didn't finish it and ended up throwing it away. Overall, everything was good. Service was good too. We didn't wait so long. Food was really hot! I enjoyed it. Will be coming back (:   *For the amount of food that was given. I couldn't complain about the price."}
{"text":"I lived in Beijing for almost five years. Ever since we moved back to the US, we've been searching for this authentic Beijing flavor. Nada. We visited dozens of Chinese restaurants. Some were good and some were not. But none had that unique Beijing flavor.   We drove to Hoover Dam and on the way back we spotted China A Go Go. Zero expectations.  We ordered Orange Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Fried Rice, and something very innocent looking for me: Chinese Eggplant and Tofu.  My Beijing favorite.  Bingo. The unique Beijing flavor exploded in my mouth. Authentic, spicy the right way, eggplants cooked just right.  Just what I was looking for. Too bad they are in Henderson Nevada.  If one opens in Seattle please let me know."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!  It's got great chinese food and huge portions for what you pay.  We love to get the family dinners for the six of us and we always have leftovers.    The sushi is okay, but I've had better.  I like the General Tso's chicken and combination fried rice.  It's cooked just right and not too spicy. I've only found one other chinese restraunt in the Vegas valley that has almost as good General Tso's chicken but it's on the other side of town.  The staff is exceptional!  They are really nice and attentive without hovering over you.  Tina is friendly and knowledgable.   They also deliver and do take out.  I've never used either as we like the service so much.  The place is very clean too."}
{"text":"Here's the deal about THIS China A GoGo in North Las Vegas...We head there usually to sit down to eat...Spartan digs, but the majority of their biz is the traditional Chinese take-out...The first thing you do notice is that all the folks working in the restaurant ARE native Chinese...Many do not even speak English as they toil on the woks in the kitchen area...No matter, the friendly ladies at the front are more than helpful to fulfill your food order...and in regards to the grub...It is GOOD...Yea, no kidding...The servings are plentiful and mighty tasty...An added bonus is that they go out of their way to be friendly...Once you grace the doorstep several times, you're in...We always get a handshake or hug from the staff...No bull...They DO care if you eat there...We get one of the two full course meals for under $25 bucks each time we show up...It feeds us at least two more times from the Styrofoam containers...Overall it all adds up to a very positive repast at China A GoGo at this North Las Vegas location...A caring staff and good tasty Chinese food...A nice combo to find now and again...Stay in to eat or take it home, either way YOU win here..."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest, most delicious restaurants in Boulder City. I've found that out here typically chain restaurants are the safest bet, but this one exceeded expectations. The staff was very friendly and courteous, the food was great and cooked to order, and it was reasonably priced. I found out recently that they deliver as well which is awesome. Great choice!"}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago it was pretty bad service. I regret ordering my 3 year old broccoli beef! I felt so bad I had her eat it! It did not taste like meat! It had a very elastic chewy consistency. She is a carnivore I should've known something was wrong when she spit it out and ate everything but the meat.  I had the Tsao General Chicken that was actually good; the egg soup however had NOO flavor they probably added extra water (that is what it tasted like)"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible. She threw my receipt in my bag while my food was open. She didn't say thank you and when I ask for hot mustard she act as if I was bothering her. I don't think I will be back unless this shrimp fried rice is amazing."}
{"text":"China A SlowSlow.  If they were busy I would certainly cut them some slack, but the \"chef\" was busy messing with his iPhone, the woman behind the counter has zero people skills, and the food was bland.  The prices?  decent if the food had taste and came within an hour.  My advice?  Go in for lunch, order dinner, leave, come back.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave no star. HORRIBLE!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!!! Worst customer service ever. The lady on the phone was extremely rude and didn't even care that I was upset. I waiting and hour and a half for my food and it still hadn't arrived so when I called to check, the guy hadn't even left and I ended up canceling my order because she was so rude and did not care at all that I was upset. Also the manager wasn't even there so I couldn't even talk to someone who could make a difference. Ended up canceling my order all together because I was over their attitudes.  Go to any of the other locations. The one on Rainbow and Lake Mead is amazing. They will be the only one I go to from now on. Even if I have to go out of my way to get it from them. This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sub par. Received one wrong item but ate it anyways even tho I read out the items I wanted including the number next to it so I was clear. BF didn't enjoy his food."}
{"text":"good food and a good price.  glad the driver decided to wait till I got my order to sit down in the dining room to cut his finger nails."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   I am kind of weird. If I want Chinese I normally go to the buffet. This place is the only exception to that rule.  Lets commence with the actual store. The location is very clean and organized. I am surprised that they have so many staff members being that is it kind of small. (maybe they have the whole family)  My favorite dish here is egg fu yung! I tried it for the first time ever, and was shocked at what I had been missing out on. The use actual gravy at China A GoGo. (other places use what looks like Teriyaki sauce)  Over all the fried rice was really good as well. Other places offer free egg rolls when you order so much food. In which case I do!  This particular locations doesn't. (which is whatever you know)  I can't see my self giving them 5 stars yet that lack in the fried wonton area. They are very diminutive. The taste is on point, just need to work on size and crispness."}
{"text":"This place used to be hit or miss now just about every time it has been a miss. Tonight was the last time I will not be returning. Sweet-and-sour chicken most times I've ever ordered it from a restaurant comes with the sweet-and-sour sauce on it and the chicken is not breaded and there are plenty of vegetables. In the photo you can see the chicken is dry and it's about 80% puffy breading and the terrible sweet-and-sour sauce is on the side. Unfortunately this was a pick up to go order because if I was in the restaurant I would have sent it back and left. Honey walnut shrimp soso. Being charged for one Carton of white rice when ordering two entrées it's crazy to me. Two entrées one side of rice which should come with the entrées and one Boba tea. $28 and change. I'm actually going to call them and see if I can bring the food back  After phone call I would change to four stars but yelp will not let me update my review so I have to put it here.  OK I just got off the phone with them they are not making me bring the food back they took down my phone number and they said they are going to give me the credit for the cost of the two meals next time I go in. I guess that's fine but now at 9 PM I have to cook everyone dinner or we don't eat."}
{"text":"i love the food here better than regular old panda express. big portions too!"}
{"text":"Fast. Tasty. Nice. Exactly what I'm looking for in takeout. We'll be going here again."}
{"text":"Okay the one star is for the food. Twice I have ordered from them and the first time the food was just average. This last time the shrimp tasted like ammonia and as a former cook in Las Vegas that is a sign of bad shrimp. If they served that it makes me wonder just how clean and sanitary they are down there.  They did refund my last dinner but I'm sure I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Great classic New York style Chinese food. They have great deals lunch and dinner combos, which is great if you are ordering for one!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ginger and onion beef.  Their chow mein is delicious and no greasy.  I appreciate the extra kick of spicy from the jalapeño in the General Tso's chicken. The staff is very friendly.  The food is always ready quickly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, always fast delivery. I really enjoy the char siu. Great place for delivery, good prices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I never have been a fan of chinese restaurants, other than Panda Express, but this place is great. I'd recommend the sweet n sour chicken :) And the best part is, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality of the food which is excellent.  Great service both in the restaurant and with the delivery people.   We regularly enjoy  the lunch service and occasionally sushi.  We are definitely satisfied repeat customers."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was really good.  I tried the Mongolian beef lunch special.  It was a good price and you got a lot of food."}
{"text":"China a Go Go has a good lunch special menu with reasonable prices. The food is good and although the place is fairly small it is busy most of the time, I suggest ordering ahead to avoid waiting times.   I would have given them 4 stars but the fact that the soda fountain area was a bit messy made it challenging to give them the higher score."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place, having heard some not so favorable reviews of other locations from friends.  But, we gave it a shot last week and I'm glad we did.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood and is very good \"fast\" Chinese food.  Also, it's leaps and bounds better than the Panda across the street.  My wife and I shared the family meal A, which gave us enough leftovers for more than 2 additional meals.  She chose the pepper steak and I had the house special chicken.  It was advertised as spicy.  The sauce certainly had some heat, but I wouldn't describe it as spicy.  In the future, I'll ask if there is a way they can spice this dish up.  The veggies still retained a lot of their crispness, which I prefer.  The chicken pieces were large, and none of them were tough.  As noted above, you get a lot of food in your entrees.  I would definitely order the house special chicken again.  The pork fried rice was likewise a winner.  Lots of pork and plenty of veggies throughout.  It wasn't greasy, which this dish certainly can be.  I usually put more soy sauce on fried rice, but this dish didn't need it.  The egg rolls were probably my least favorite part of the meal, but they weren't awful.  Just a little greasy and the wrappers came apart.  The soup had some spice to it, and you get a huge container of it.  We didn't finish the soup, even after eating our leftovers.  This place delivers to our neighborhood, so I am certain we'll be getting it again in the near future."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month and it's always fast and taste great! We get the orange chicken and  sesame chicken."}
{"text":"It's a long story but we ended up at this restaurant on Christmas evening primarily because it was open.  It turned out to be quite an enjoyable Christmas dinner.  The food here is quite good and tasty.  We ordered chicken with green beans, Mongolian beef, beef chow mein, and my favorite chicken Szechuan.  We also ordered hot and sour soup which was surprisingly good.  In addition, this restaurant has really pleasant employees and a pleasant atmosphere.  So in short, I liked the place, and the next time I am in town, I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I ordered the wonton soup to go and it was very tasty. The service was fast..10 mins. I haven't ordered anything else but the soup was tasty and the portion was a nice size. Next time if would like to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"If you like mushy noodles that fall apart before they can reach your mouth this is the place for you. Stick to the rice. Combination chow mein I don't know why but the meat seemed a bit slimy and the potstickers were ok. Salt and pepper chicken wings so tiny!!!!! $9 dollars for itty bitty things what were they from baby chicks???? Overall $25 dollars for slightly off tasting food. This place may be overdue for a health inspection.  Is it"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place again like we promised. This time it was totally not disappointing. Everything we ordered was tasty and full of flavor.   This time I picked the Garlic Shrimp and added Chow Mein on the side. The shrimp was spicy just like I was promised and was loaded with veggies. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness. The Chow Mein really surprised me. It was filled with freshly sauteed garlic and veggies. My husband chose the Orange Chicken and Fried Rice. Both were delicious and the Orange Chicken did not contain the pieces of orange peel that my husband dislikes.The Fried Rice also had onions which were excellent in it. The portions were huge and served as a midnight snack and breakfast the next morning.   I'm really glad we decided to give China a Go Go another shot. Finally, a good Chinese spot right in my neighborhood. Can't wait to try their sushi!"}
{"text":"My go-to on cheat days! I always call in before picking up because sometimes the wait can be longer than I'd like it to be but the food is awesome!! A little pricy for my liking but delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying China A GoGo, I had delivered to my house it took a while lol but was good I ordered chow main and orange chicken really good!"}
{"text":"On a Monday MLK day I ordered from here . I was immediately on edge because as soon as the phone was picked up the lady said 'Please Hold' I didn't understand so I proceeded to ask for an order for delivery . After 3 minutes she finally answer and was very short with me . Didn't say goodbye when I finished ordering she just hung up . So after thinking it over I tried to call back like a minute later to cancel my order and it didn't work because 'the caller was busy' VERY poor customer service . My food did arrive an hour later and was fairly warm still and was pretty good . Good food Bad Service !"}
{"text":"Ok,,, i come here only for the lychee smoothie with boba.  I like it here for some reason.   I have tried the food at other locations and found it to be solid, never an issue buying food here. Hey we all can  have a bad day,,, well i ordered the pad thai,, well first mistake ordering a thai dish at a chinese joint... DOH,,  I ordered it med spicey,  it was plenty spicy, over powered the dish, the pad thai sauce was weak, the veggies didnt seem too fresh, the noodles were ehhhhhh.  The normal large portion was not so large.  I usually cant finish my meal, but i did tonight... I was disappointed in my selection tonight,  I will eat here again but i will stick to chinese food not thai... The boba was good though...  This joint isnt bad,, if i were with friends i would eat here, its not the best, but i give it a 2stars for my meal tonight.... Hope this yelps...  06/17/14 Quality in food has gone down hill... Food quality is inconsistent, ranging from \"okay eat it or have nothing\"  to disposal will like it...  No longer a fan..."}
{"text":"China A GoGo. I don't think this area needed another Chinese restaurant specially one that's the same like the others.  I was hopeful of a unique experience and a amazing brew dishes. But it's the same like the other Chinese restaurant that we have in centennial hills.  They do give you big portion. Now, I don't know if they did that cause they just opened , but I'll try them more often since there Around the corner from my house.  Customer interaction needs improvement."}
{"text":"I think this place is under rated, not yelp wise but general wise. The banner outside says 'NOW OPEN' so I'm not sure if they just opened up or are now just under new management. But I can tell you this, the people who work there are super nice and very friendly!! The food is delicious and made fresh! The portions per plate are very generous and they cook everything pretty fast and are accommodating to food and allergy needs!   I know this is a franchise so I'm not sure what the other locations are like, but I can highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it is literally the only Chinese food place that doesn't make my stomach hurt AND their shrimp fried rice has JUMBO shrimp #loveit"}
{"text":"Ordered \"New York style chow mein\"  Have they been to New York ?!  The description of the dish says it is on top of crispy noodles.  What I got.  Cheep veggies in a white sauce. No flavor at all!  A bag of fried won ton strips. (They call that noodles)   Worst Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome taste and excellent value! We stopped in after an exhausting hike in nearby Red Rock Canyon. The Mongolian beef lunch combo was made to order to my personal level of spiciness. The texture of the beef was perfect with the mix of onions and green peppers. Lots of fried rice (with plenty of vegetables) and lo mein were included. The lunch even included a nice fried pastry dessert and fortune cookie! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person to make super bad reviews but for this place I definitely will! Food is good no doubt but customer service and delivery is top of the line HORRIBLE. This is the 3rd time we tried this place for delivery and each time something went bad. you call they try to fix by apologizing and giving you a credit, ok so we gave them another try then food arrived cold as hell and again they messed up the order we called again and guess what? We will give u a credit, uh no we don't want credit! We want our food that's missing! We gave them them too many try's hoping they won't mess it up and still nothing! Same exact item missing and or cold or old.. Like really? 3 times!! So I officially gave up and we will not and I repeat WILL NOT order from here again. And I hope this review will help you decide to order or not from here as well.."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I am very happy to have a local place that we all like. The staff are super sweet and helpful. The service is really great and reliable. Everything is clean and comfortable. They are very helpful from the seating to special requests. The seating is a pretty metallic blue. The atmosphere is much nicer than you'd expect for a small Chinese place.  Can't beat the lunch specials for 6.25 the deal is over the top especially since the portions are pretty generous. If the entrée you want isn't on the official menu for lunch they might still make it for you if you ask, they made me moo goo gai pan one day ( no extra charge).  They have dinner specials too. You can eat here on the cheap. The food itself seems very clean and fresh. Not bland, yet uninvolved as in no junk and artificial heavy sauces. Things taste more authentic and healthy here.  Everyone has liked everything we tried out so far. The only thing worth mentioning is the sweeter meals like sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken and orange chicken etc are very sugary so if you are diabetic take heed. Those dishes are great tasting but they aren't for you if you can't have much sugar and need to watch your intake.   They are very quick when you call in an order. I have never been kept waiting once, not once!! That's so great!   I think it's actually faster than Panda  where I always seem to get stuck behind the most indecisive people or worse the person throwing a huge party and has them cooking up a storm for a party tray or two.... And I swear some people act as if they never saw teriyaki chicken before in their life and take 3 hours to decide in that place! So before you die of old age waiting in line just check this place out, they'll have you cooked and ready by the time you'd even get to the register across the street! :) ( Not hatin' on Panda their staff is good, it's just the customers....)   Also They have a lot of sushi here, I have never had sushi so I can't comment. But I am betting it's good.  All in all reliable service and food. A++++++++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"Although the food is decent, they serve a good amount of food for the price you pay. I got the lunch special (house special chicken with rice and \"chow mein\") and crab ragoons. The ragoons where a lil too greasy for my taste but like I said before, good amount for the price. My complaint here is the customer service. There was two ladies taking orders. The one that took mine wasn't completely rude but wasn't attentive at all. While I was making my order she picked up the phone and took someone else order. I had to ask for a drink because she never offered, and also only came to the table to drop off food. The other lady was attentive and nice to her other customers."}
{"text":"Always my go to spot. Good food and fast service! Try their combination fried rice! We came in on a Monday night because we didn't feel like cooking. China a go go always has great food. It's in the north part of Las Vegas and close to the 215."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this location as I recently moved and compared to the rest I was disappointed.  Now China a Go Go is nothing special to begin with so I can't say I'm surprised. First let me say how slow the service was. I ordered Curry Chicken with fried rice, a Teriyaki Chicken bowl, and Thai Tea and it took 50 minutes to receive the food. Now let me clarify the place was empty, they confirmed my order with me 30 minutes after ordering, and the other locations are not like this. They also gave me my Curry Chicken in a container that looked larger than normal but actually had less space. Oh and lets not forget I only got 5 small pieces of chicken. Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"You would think a chain would be consistent on food but not this one. The one on trop and hualapai is good and also the one on rainbow and smoke ranch but this one is terrible. I tried it twice thinking first time was a fluke but it wasn't. If you like China A Go Go skip this one and don't eat here it's disappointing"}
{"text":"Wanted good Chinese, so went to the yelp app for recommendations.  The portions were generous, the Mongolian beef was alittle spicy(great) with Jalepenos, red peppers and green peppers added.  The best I've had honestly.   Had a sushi roll and it was terrific too.  Definitely a good choice!"}
{"text":"Very good quick Chinese spot! Everything is fresh and the veggies are always cooked to perfection. Can get pretty busy so make sure if you're in a hurry to call in ahead:)"}
{"text":"Food is great and they serve huge portions. But DO NOT use the yelp app to order and pay. Staff seemed really confused how to handle my order when I picked it up, and wanted to charge me again. They told me to call the eat24 people to sort it out, which seemed odd. No one at eat24 responded. They finally gave me my order 10 mins later after taking a copy of my credit card \"in case.\"  Just call and order the old fashioned way!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week, it's that good. It's definitely one of the better Chinese places we've been to. The food is fresh and hot and their low mein, eggrolls, sesame chicken, and sesame beef are wayyyy good. And I'm kind of picky, haha. Plus, their service is good and the employees have been nothing but nice to us. We've had such a hard time finding a Chinese place we like. We love it here!"}
{"text":"I started eating from the Valle Verde location about 10 years ago. I was pleasantly surprised when they opened a location near my home.   When I ate in their dining room, I was pleasantly surprised at the size and cleanliness. The service was quick and friendly.   I can vouch for their Cashew Chicken, Fried Rice, California Roll and Sweet & Sour Chicken. Today I learned that they do have All You Can Eat Sushi. It's probably not a good thing having AYCE Sushi close to home, but I'm going to be trying that very soon.   Their delivery service is also great! Quick and Fresh!"}
{"text":"There are a couple of other Chinese restaurants in this area that have similar menu selections but we choose China a Go Go because the food and service are consistent. I usually ask for my entrees with \"no veggies\" (because my son & hubby don't like them) and they always accommodate. The girl that usually takes orders at this location is always super nice & will sometimes throw in a little treat for us.   After receiving such great service at this location I was surprised when I went to a location near my friends house and they were really rude."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Chinese takeout place for a little while now. I'm just tired of the Panda. So I checked here on Yelp and decide to try China A Go Go tonight.  First, the restaurant itself looks like a decent place to eat. It's pretty new, clean and pleasant looking. I didn't eat in however, so I can't comment on the table service.  My favorite Chinese dish is Mongolian beef and I use it as a standard for comparison for the Chinese places I visit.   I ordered the Mongolian beef entree at $9.95. It came with steamed white rice, but upgrades to house fried rice or lo mein noodles are available for $2.50 more. I also added 2 egg rolls for $1.75.  I felt the entree prices were a bit high, but you get a decent portion. For the average person it would probably be a filling meal plus a bit left over for a late snack.  The Mongolian beef was quite hot (spicy) and there were a lot of those thin red chili peppers to pick out. If you can eat one of those good for you, they would keep me up all night with heartburn. Overall it was very tasty even though a bit hotter than I would like. There was plenty of beef and a good beef to veggie ratio. One small gripe is the beef was just a bit under cooked IMO. Most people however would probably prefer it the way it was served. I like mine more on the well done side.  The egg rolls (really spring rolls) were fine, nothing special though.  Overall it was a better than average Chinese meal and definitely a nice change from Panda Express. It's just a bit pricey for me to make it a regular addition to my nightly dinner choices. I see the lunch specials look like a good deal, however I can't visit during lunch hours unfortunately."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for years and love their food and service - definitely consistent. Their menu is awesome. I have enjoyed every dish I've had. My favorite is the Cashew Chicken - Delicious! It is a perfect balance of vegetables, rice, chicken, and cashews. You do not feel like you're getting tons of filler vegetables or onions. General Tso's Chicken is very delicious as well. We decided to dine in for the first time. We were not disappointed. Great friendly service and staff. They had table service. Offered us free donuts. The food was from their lunch menu and the prices were fantastic. Our food was piping hot, packed in large portions, and delicious. I got in trouble for trying to reach over and sample everyone's food. Hehe. The Taro bubble tea with Boba was overflowing and delicious!! We sampled the watermelon and the mango bubble teas also - tasty! We will definitely keep ordering and dining in to appease our Chinese food cravings! China-a-gogo rocks!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We've ordered here multiple times. Delivery is always faster than expected and the food is always fresh and super hot! Perfect and yummy! I always get the Kung pao shrimp mmmm soo spicy and Delish! And the chow mien is sooo good! Kids always get orange chicken and that's yummy. And hubby always gets Mongolian beef, this is the only place that makes it right."}
{"text":"Love the food and service is my go to for Chinese food strongly recommend this place especially the orange chicken ans paid thai noodles."}
{"text":"This little restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The outside is very unassuming. It's a little hard to see from both Boulder Highway and E. Lake Mead, but it's at the intersection next door to Albertson's. It's also easy to get in and out of the parking lot because there are traffic signals to reach both streets. I was there at 6:15 PM, and was able to get and out in less than 15 minutes.  It's not a large place, but it's clean. The staff members were polite, and my take-out order was ready within 5 minutes or so from when I placed it.   I don't eat sushi or sashimi, but they have both an eat-in area, and they offer take-out. They also offer 8 or so different types of beer, including domestic and imported.  The menu has a large variety of entrees, appetizers, and soups. I ordered chicken chop suey and plain fried rice. The fried rice was an extra charge of $2.50 to substitute for the steamed white rice that came with the dish. Instead of packaging in the typical styrofoam containers, the food came in sturdy containers with lids to better prevent spilling and storing. My total order was less than $15 including tax.  The portions were generous, and would easily serve two adults. The chicken was tender, the vegetables seemed fresh, and neither had been overcooked. The sauce was really good with a touch of ginger. The rice wasn't gummy, and even though it didn't have any type of meat, it was still very flavorful.  There aren't very many restaurants in the immediate area other than fast food so I was very happy to find this restaurant. They deliver for an additional surcharge depending on the distance from their location.  For anyone who lives close by, and for those looking for something better than Panda Express with similar pricing, this spot is worth a try."}
{"text":"So happy they are local and don't have to drive to Henderson. Had good customer service and food was good as well."}
{"text":"Probamos Kung pau chicken y chao fun  noodles estubo exelente. Buenas porciones..servicio fue rápido.."}
{"text":"Delicious food made quickly with great service! Definitely will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"ordered seafood delight without water chestnuts add tofu please !! Not a problem! always Hot.  always great!!!"}
{"text":"Great service!!!! We love the sesame chicken with Vegetable Fried rice and cream cheese wontons Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"The long: This is my go-to Chinese take-out place, because it's close and it's consistant. That aside, I'm very happy with the food and service. Every time I order they add in a little something - usually donuts or almond cookies. I forgot to bring a coupon in (for eggrolls) but they were cool about it and didn't charge me for the eggrolls. For take-out, the food is usually read in about 10-15 minutes. After 5+ trips to this place, I've had to wait once, and it was only about 5 minutes; every other time, the food is done before I arrive.  Food I've tried: Eggrolls: decent. Better than Panda Express, but not as good as east coast eggrolls. (Story of my life in Vegas!) War Wonton Soup: Yup! Get it. Garlic Chicken: Spicy and tasty. (Ordered once: tender and delicious.) Spicy eggplant and tofu: This is my go-to dish, and I love it. Delicious sauce, tender eggplant, not super spicy (could be spicier, but I'm okay with the spicy level they deliver). Orange chicken: Sometimes it's a little tough, sometimes it's awesome. Still, worth the chance. Sweet and Sour chicken: Much like the Orange chicken, it's sometimes tough and sometimes awesome. Still, pretty good, generally. Walnut shrimp: Pretty good. Not the best I've had, but consistantly pretty good! (And in the Chinese food word, consistant is a win!)  In short: Super nice staff, consistant cooking. Their soup is awesome; meat dishes can be hit or miss on tenderness, but the flavor is pretty spot-on."}
{"text":"Wow, Yelpers are harsh!   I am a fan of China A Gogo. They cook all food fresh to order. Prices are reasonable. They deliver for free. The restaurant is clean.  The price to food ratio is outstanding. I've order a few times and the sometimes throw on a free side dish.  My favorite dishes are there gyoza dumplings (they're huge), honey walnut shrip, spring rolls, and Beef Pepper Steak. I've noshed on other tasty delights and they've been really tasty.   Definitely worth a trip or giving them a call if you're in SW Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Convenient location for me. I've tried a few other Chinese take out places in the vicinity and none of them were as good. I feel like they're not as good as they use to be. The shrimp dishes aren't that great. But I always get General Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak...and they're both good. Prices are good and staff is nice."}
{"text":"Our local favorite! We come here once a week, highly recommended for authentic Chinese food! Very good portion and fast they even deliver! Our favorites are house chicken and combo fried rice and honey walnut shrimp!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain Chinese spot. The food is fairly good and the prices are ok. Not much else to say. They offer Chinese donuts which I personally dont care for but my wife loves."}
{"text":"Very good food. A varied menu with lots of choices. Mu shu pork and chicken fried rice are our favorites. We pick up, and the good preparation is very fast."}
{"text":"I am in the medical field and infection control is #1. I used to eat here, and even recommended my family and friends when visiting from out of town. I went for my birthday and ate the all you can eat buffet because I loved sushi (past tense). I experienced the worse diarrhea of my life hours after I ate sashimi that lasted 5 days straight. 10 months later, I am still suffering from the infection and medical providers say it will take months to exit fully. Parasitic infections are an awful experience. Las Vegas Fox News had an article saying there is an increase in tapeworms found in sushi in the Valley. This fact is not this establishment's fault. They just happen to serve salmon sashimi that got me sick. I can no longer eat sushi in the same enthused manner or go into this establishment again without feeling sick to my stomach. Also, what made it worse, as I walked out of the restaurant with my food, one of the workers were standing on the right side smoking a cigarette and blew a big booger out of his nose using his hands! I hope he thoroughly washed his hands and face to keep up with infection control."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place but they need a website bad! it would make ordering and seeing a menu much better. Plus I think it would increase their business a lot. The food is always hot and fresh. The food has been great every time I've ordered from them. I like the fried rice and chicken chow main is tops. Only three stars because its has no stand alone website with a menu and I think that is important in Chinese takeout or restaurants.."}
{"text":"For delivery: we ordered combo chow fun, pork with eggplant, orange chicken and egg rolls (with FREE 1/2 order of honey walnut shrimp....coupon).  Food came quick and everything was really tasty! Portions were good too!! Was really surprised at how good the food was....only downer was delivery fee was $2.00 and we live really close (but oh well...most places charge to deliver).  This is actually 3.5 stars.  We will order here again!"}
{"text":"This is place is not for Chinese people. Food is too sweet and salty.  For the price it's not bad for lunch special."}
{"text":"I hate giving a 1 star rating, I really do. I just want to warn my fellow yelpers, do not eat here. Don't do it. The food is horrible, seriously it's probably the worse Chinese restaurant around. I ordered food for lunch through Eat24 and the food arrived on time and all, but horrible. The noodles are fluorescent orange, the orange chicken has a globby fructose corn syrup coating that's inedible. The first bite of chicken I ate had a piece of broken bone in it -_- yuck!!!!!!! I'm so disgusted!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food never disappoints and they always give great customer service. Favorite Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Everyone has been so nice and helpful! Food was extremely fast and tastes amazing! =)"}
{"text":"I'm always a little leery about take out Chinese, I've been let down so many times and have even worried if I was really eating chicken.. but China A GoGo has restored my faith in Chinese food!  The BF craves Chinese but I usually talk him out of it. Today I gave in because I've been a little under the weather, didn't feel like cooking and definitely didn't feel like going out. So that left us with either Pizza or Chinese since they both deliver, Chinese won out. We had a menu for these guys saved in a drawer along with another Chinese place, I looked over both menus and decided this place looked better between the two.  We ordered the Family Dinner a which was $25.98, there are several entree options with this dinner package, but here's what we ended up with:      Hot and Sour Soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-a-gogo-las-vegas-2?select=Mq8x1wTQtRBHnBhz6ALoZQ#rI4E2YTtibNmdYmKZ3VtTw      2 Egg Rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-a-gogo-las-vegas-2?select=Mq8x1wTQtRBHnBhz6ALoZQ#uqVcQiNSBgQ7hNDkkPK4NA      2 Crab Rangoons      BBQ Pork Fried Rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-a-gogo-las-vegas-2?select=Mq8x1wTQtRBHnBhz6ALoZQ#7IHB_St91NrM2n4gyi6OVQ      General Tso's Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-a-gogo-las-vegas-2?select=Mq8x1wTQtRBHnBhz6ALoZQ#O__jl9jnZY3J3n8MwHBIsg      Mongolian Beef http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-a-gogo-las-vegas-2?select=Mq8x1wTQtRBHnBhz6ALoZQ#Uv3S8esTM2vJhZYSu3sI2A With the delivery charge and tax our total was $30.08 + driver's tip We had a coupon for a free order of Fried Rice with a $25 purchase so we had them throw that in as well. The ordering was quick and easy; the communication with the staff which often can be tricky with these places was actually good.  The food was steaming hot and delivered fast! (Although we don't live very far away.) Everything arrived in cute little Chinese takeout boxes, along with chopsticks, soy sauce, hot mustard and fortune cookies.  There was A TON of food, I felt we really got our money's worth, enough to feed 4 people, and more than 2 people needed for sure!  The Hot and Sour Soup came in a large container and was delicious! Had shrimp and crab in it and came with noodles on the side that you could add.  The Egg Rolls were nothing special, wouldn't order them on their own. Vegetable only, no meat inside.  The Crab Rangoons were average. I generally like these but it's more for the cream cheese than anything. These were just okay.  The BBQ Pork Fried Rice wasn't my favorite, I'm not a huge pork fan, I would have preferred regular fried rice myself but again it wasn't bad.  The General Tso's Chicken was terrific, I kept piling more and more on my plate which says a lot for a non-Chinese fast food eater! the breading on the chicken was soft not hard like you often find. It was spicy, had green peppers, red chili peppers, carrots, onions and pineapple. Yum!  The Mongolian Beef was excellent as well. Thin strips of Beef which I always appreciate, onion strings & chili peppers. This dish was spicy too!  I love spicy food but I ended up with the hiccups  because I kept having to hold my breath. LOL  We have plenty of leftovers which will last us a while, but I'm sure we'll be ordering from them again soon."}
{"text":"Best sushi and service ever!  Our go to place, and believe me we are picky!  It's not on the menu, but ask for the Momo roll it is amazing!  Momo is the sushi chef, and he rocks!!! Thanks Momo and staff, you guys are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Love going to China Go Go for sushi and family dinners. Only issue is that service can sometimes be very rude. Also when ordering a family dinner the dishes come out way to fast. One right on top of each other. Finally another downside is when ordering all you can eat sushi no one else can eat with you. They also bring out all of the spicing rolls before the not spicy ones. Overall recommend, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was ok. They did deliver on time and the guy was nice. However the food is mediocre. The rice, noodles, and wontons were fresh but all the orange chicken wasn't fresh so I didn't eat it all. I've had better Chinese food back home in Ga."}
{"text":"I've frequented this particular location a couple of times, and I can say this; if you are looking for cheap and quick take-out or delivery in (not Green Valley) Henderson, this is a good place to start.   The Chinese food is ok. The chicken fried rice is pretty good, and the orange chicken is delightful. The cream cheese rangoons are also quite good. As I stated before, it's not the best, just not the worst. Better than Panda Express, but definitely not PF Changs. However, I would not recommend the sushi.   Sometimes you just don't want to drive all over the valley for food if you live out by the lake, so this is a good option."}
{"text":"Worst food we've ever had. My \"tuna\" looked liked mushed up ground beef. And tasted like it. When they asked how our food was, we said it was not good. And they didn't care. Never again."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly place...thanks to the staff there that act professional and keep it clean...food is great also"}
{"text":"I will never order from this place again their delivery man was extremely rude wanted us to meet him at the end of our cul-de-sac would not deliver to our door called us on the phone twice and what is extremely rude when I called the restaurant to complain about the delivery driver they basically ignored me and talking to another employee while I was trying to explain what went on really bad customer service"}
{"text":"Its a must the garlic beef is the best great prices and service the appetizer platter was excellent. My wife really enjoys the chow fun. My nephew really likes the lemon chicken always quick with refills on beverages. Many lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is a good place I like the chow mein and the orange chicken is really good.. everyone is so nice and friendly and it looks very clean inside.."}
{"text":"Only went in for a boba fix I've needed for a few months. Little expensive, not too many choices. But it's a pretty good tai tea that I've had in a while. I haven't ordered anything to eat yet, but it was pretty busy when I went. The gentleman and lady who were at the front were very polite."}
{"text":"This place should not have three stars! The food was AMAZING and AUTHENTIC! Finally a place that knows what spicy is when you ask for it! You can ask for mild too if you don't like spicy. LARGE amounts of food and it was FRESH and HOT. Mind you I ordered delivery was told 60-90 minutes through Eat 24 from the Yelp app; they were here in 35 minutes. I will order again from here 100% so good!"}
{"text":"I received the sesame chicken and cho mien. It satisfied my Chinese craving and the serving size was over flowing. You really get a lot for what you buy."}
{"text":"For carryout Chinese food, China a Go Go is the best. Everything is always freshly made, and hot. We use the Beyond Menu app; orders are always correct and ready in 10 minutes when we get there. For years we have been ordering the Family Meals, which includes  one large soup, two entrees, a choice of fried rice or chow mein, and an appetizer of two fried shrimp and two crab Rangoon. Recently we discovered that if we order the Individual Dinner, it's just as much food with more choices. It's the same menu of course, but there's no argument over which soup to order as we can each have our favorite...mine is the Hot and Sour...and we can split the fried rice AND chow mein. With plenty of leftovers. Seriously, the Individual Meal is enough for two people. And it's cheaper to order this way, too!"}
{"text":"Great place. So glad they opened in my neighborhood. Got here at 6:30 on Sunday and line was out the door."}
{"text":"Staff is very polite and I absolutely love the food! I will definitely return. They even made my food the way I like it. I recommend this place if you like fast service and quality."}
{"text":"Update: food is still great, but I had to share this picture of the green curry. They take \"green\" really seriously and obviously added a lot of good coloring to their meat. The picture does not do it justice. It tasted great, but it felt like St. Patrick's day!"}
{"text":"My new favorite. Always hot always fresh. Friendly clean and just great atmosphere.3rd trip no problems ."}
{"text":"This place has gone severely down hill in the 4 years we've been ordering food from them. Consistently incorrect orders, inconsistent preparation. Lastly today we ordered delivery and not only did it take 1 hour and 15 mins to get here (it's a five min drive) it was spilled all over the bag when it did get here."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and have never had a bad meal. Sushi is great, (could use some additional variety), and all of the dishes that I have had have been amazing. Highly recommend anything on the menu that uses the in house made black bean sauce."}
{"text":"Best egg Foo young in town. Very courtious, food always prepared right, and portions Soo generous"}
{"text":"Average. After reading multiple site reviews that showed it to be above-average, I gave it a try. The dumplings were rubbery and not very flavorful. The pork fried rice was okay. It was worth a try, but only one."}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberry pineapple Boba drink and the guy brought out an orange colored smoothie that tasted nothing like strawberry and everything mango.  I went up and asked if it really was Strawberry Pineapple and the girl very abruptly insisted that yes that is what it was, it was just mixed. So I sat down.  I then watched as the guy showed the girl what flavors he used and he pointed to the Mango and instead of remaking it they just laughed about it.  When they brought us our food we said something again to the same girl and she started to say it was right and I told her no, I watched them point to the flavor he used and she immediately stopped refuting and asked if I wanted a new one. (Of course I wanted a new one, I wanted what I ordered!) They are lucky I wasn't allergic.  They made it right but only after she knew they were caught.  One stars for lying and covering it up.  Very disappointed.  Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for run of the mill Chinese food look no farther! This place is close to my house so whatever, I'll probably come back. But there is nothing special about it.  I had the (soggy) potstickers, corn egg flower soup and the shrimp with lobster sauce. About a cup too much salt for me. If I go back I'll ask for no salt!"}
{"text":"I won't be so mean as to give it less than 3 stars, it serves its purpose-good to call when you have a craving and don't feel like going out-of you are near them for delivery. The pork strips are actually really good, this is why they got more than 2 stars from me, but don't call a spring roll an egg roll-I SOOO miss egg rolls as they have been largely replaced with Spring rolls-if you want to know what I mean by egg roll go to Von's and get Chung's Pork Egg Rolls in the freezer section-THOSE ARE REAL HUNAN EGG ROLLS. I also am baffled why they do not have pork dumplings but rather opt for chicken pot stickers (pan fried pork \"ravioli\" or dumplings are the best). By and large their meal menu is pretty thorough I can say the Szechuan beef is good, sweet and sour pork is also really good. I'm disappointed that their appetizer menu is very limited and a bit atypical. On the final odd plus is they offer Thai Tea (its sweetened milk tea-MUST TRY). I think many reviewers are a bit harsh, this restaurant doesn't pretend to be high end cuisine-it's fast food Chinese at a pricier level than Panda Express but also offers more authentic cuisine than a Panda Express."}
{"text":"Just found this little spot around the corner from me and I'm glad I did. I grew up in NY around the corner from a great Chinese spot and miss the food. Went there twice since I've been here in Vegas and the food was perfect both times. Good healthy food and portions, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love China A Go Go but this one in particular added some extra ingredients that usually are not in the normal meals.  It's ok but I like my meals consistent."}
{"text":"I've been here around a few dozen times now and I still like it.  It's not authentic. It's not healthy. It's not the best in Las Vegas or Henderson but you know what, it's the best for a few miles all around, in this area of East Henderson.  Yeah. I know there are much better places in china town, on south eastern, on sahara, there are better places -everywhere-...  ...but there are times living in far east henderson you just don't want to deal with traffic, freeways, wasting 30-60 minutes there and back depending on where you're driving and you just want to hurry up and get yo a$$ back home. I challenge you to find better chinese within a few miles of the corner of lake mead and boulder highway.   So if you don't want to drive all the way over to Green Valley, just order already. It's not going to kill you and you know what, it's going to taste just fine.   Things we have ordered and liked: I really like the egg foo young. It doesn't make sense because the gravy is not that great but they load up the eggy patties with lots of stuff and it tastes great on rice. We get the combination. We also get the honey walnut shrimp. Sweet but we like it better than Panda's. We've had quite a few other things here and someone said everything they have had has been over 4 stars. I have to agree with that. It's been consistently good unhealthy fast food chinese when you're lazy and eatin' on the couch with your honey.  My ***** five star rating comes from being the best in MY neighborhood. A neighborhood restaurant is one that is within 4 miles of my house. I can dash there and be back in my PJs extremely quickly.  It's not good enough to drive across town for and this rating may go down when some competition moves in...but until then, it's best in the area...and there isn't much to compare it to over here."}
{"text":"There are good location when you go to Hoover Dam. Place is very clean, employees are so kind, the food is delicious :-) P.S. But don't forget this is Chinese food ;-)"}
