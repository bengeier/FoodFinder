{"text":"This place is great tried it for first time today well definitely return - have seen allot of people coming in for take out - certainly hope this place makes it! Such healthy food for great prices!  Had baba ghanoush with pita and took home an offer of dawali to have for later!  About time someone offered some healthy food around the area!"}
{"text":"Great food, first time for me today and I will def be back!!!!! We had a private party and we had chicken kabobs, basmati (AMAZING!), lentil soup, grilled veggies, salad, hummus (AMAZING!)...ALL AMAZING!!!  Thank you for everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Shish Kabob was excellent served with basmati rice. Meat tender and perfectly cooked and spiced. Plain but clean dining area. Staff friendly and attentive. Will be going back."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the 1st time and it was good. The food was cooked to order, so be prepared to wait. The people are friendly. We had the hummus, it was good, not the best I've had but good. We had the gyro, chicken shawarma which we enjoyed. I will be back to try other things from the menu.  I'm lowering my initial rating ... unfortunately, we went back, everything we had the 2nd time around were all over cooked. We ordered the falafel (burnt); gyro and chicken gyro (unfortunately the meat was tough). After tonight's experience, we will not be back :("}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time over the weekend and had it delivered. The food was great and very reasonably priced. We had fatoosh salad, chicken kabobs, spicy hummus, and tabouli. Finally a place that delivers something besides pizza or Chinese. We will be loyal customers."}
{"text":"We ordered Hummus, a Gyro Sandwich, and a Gyro Salad.  The Hummus was great, diminished only by the stale pita bread.  The Gyro SW and Gyro Salad were average.  The Gyro Meat on both dishes was very thinly sliced with consistency and flavor resembling grocery store deli lunch meat rather than the classic grilled gyro meat you would expect.  We'd try it again."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped in for dinner the other evening.  Menu is similar to Continental Grill in Kent but location more convenient for me.  Chicken Kabob and Shawarma sandwiches were good and fries were hot and fresh (always a plus); Tabouli starter was good too.  I'll definitely be back to work my way around the menu and try the hummus.  It is a fantastic new world in Greater Akron when i actually have multiple choices for shawarma!"}
{"text":"This was one of my first times eating Mediterranean food... And I really enjoyed it! I ordered the chicken kabob, which came with basmati (not sure if that's the correct spelling) rice, hummus and pita! The portions are big, I wasn't able to finish my meal and ended up having the rest for lunch the next day! The chicken was very flavorful and the rice was amazing!! We ordered French fries for my 3 year old... And we all loved them! I wasn't expecting the French fries to be so delicious but they were!   The restaurant itself is very clean. It wasn't crowded when we were there, around 2 in the afternoon, so it was nice that my daughter could walk around a little bit in between eating. The staff was very helpful and patient with our large order as well as all of our questions about the food! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Best I have had in a long time. Had chicken shrama. Little garlicky, but yummy."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Going to go back on Morrocan Wednesday night! Hummus very good and falafel very good. A nice alternative to Aladdin's."}
{"text":"As a hummus lover and Middle Eastern food fanatic, I was thrilled to find this place since it is minutes away from where I live. It is more of a carry out place and has delicious appetizers and entrees. My boyfriend and I were huge fans of the kafta kabobs and tabouli. The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. It's pretty slow so expect to wait for a bit unless you order your food in advance."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. First was an off day and the food was kind of dry meat and tossed together. The other two times everything was delicious and really well prepared.   The folks who run this restaurant are super friendly. I order take-away and wait for it and has been ten to fifteen minutes.   Their platters cone with well-prepared and seasoned rice, a creamy and tasty hummus and excellent flatbread. The meats are well seasoned and nicely grilled.   Very nice local restaurant. Recommended and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food.  I love the lamb kabobs.  Every time I had placed an order, the food was always made fresh.  I like the fact that they offer online ordering- very convenient."}
{"text":"I bought a Living Social deal for my wife and I and we tried La Shish out tonight for takeout. I wasn't sure what to expect, as they serve both Mediterranean and American options. Service was very friendly, and the restaurant seemed well kept and clean. My wife is more adventurous than I, so she went with Mediterranean sampler ($8.99) and I ordered the big philly cheesesteak ($8.99). Her sampler was authentic, flavorful, and made fresh. The portion was a bit meager. If I was basing my review on the sampler, it would have been 4 stars, given the other positives. But let me tell you; I am a connoisseur of cheesesteak. I have had many cheesesteaks in my life, and it is probably my second favorite food behind pizza. If you haven't already guessed, I am a large fellow. Anyway, THIS CHEESESTEAK was the greatest, most perfect blend of veggies, steak, cheese and hoagie. The juice from the steak had permeated the bun just enough to give it a French dip flair, while a few chopped jalape√±os placed throughout gave it just a little touch of heat. I feel like many cheesesteaks want to be an \"authentic Philly\" so they pile on layers and layers of peppers and cheese, but all this cheesesteak wants to be is a damn good cheesesteak. And filling too -- the portion size of the cheesesteak was not meager at all. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Hence a well-earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great service. It was a joy to eat here. The food was the best in Akron for Middle Eastern yummies."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff! Tried brunch and was surprised to find only med selection was gyro station. All other food was standard fare found in hotel brunches. Will have to try on a diff day and revise."}
{"text":"The food was rather disappointing. Went there last week and ordered the kibbie, it tasted watery and reheated. The meat pies had very little filing. The dawali was cold and tasted like rice an lemon juice, not much flavor at all. I prefer aladdin's eatery. The counter service and dining room were ok, but over all rather disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooo Good!! I travel the state for work and La Shish Grill is one of the best vegetarian options out there. They do have food for the meat eaters out there also. Very yummy vegetarian platter."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!!! We've tried a bunch of different things on the menu and everything from the gyros to the chicken shawarma to the phenomenal rice has been so great, fresh and authentic. They are super quick for carry out and they have a nice and very open layout for dining. The staff is incredibly warm and friendly. Really can't say enough nice things about this place. Give them a try! Can't beat the taste, price or menu variety!"}
{"text":"Really love this place, food is excellent and authentic. I would give it 5 stars if the service was faster. That's likely the cost of food that's made fresh each time, though. They also offer a small menu of basic American fare so pickier eaters can join their families without worrying about not liking the food (think hot dogs, chicken nuggets, and grilled cheese on pita bread). Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and am working my way around the menu.  Even my kids, the picky eaters have found food that they enjoy.  They have a kids menu.  The French fries are the best around!  The decor is simple and the atmosphere is casual.  The hummus, kabobs, shawarma and deserts were delicious.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, always friendly, and efficient service. Definitely something different in Stow to check out :)"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and great Mediterranean food.  I was curious about a new restaurant in town so I went in and checked it out.  I was surprised to the upside.  Nice service.  Clean. Tasty food.  Reasonable prices.  Definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"La Shish is run by the same people who own Continental Grill in Kent.  If you love them there, you'll love them here.  The food is very reasonably priced and consistently excellent, and the people are always very nice.  And while Continental Grill is very tiny, this place is almost huge; even at lunch there is no problem finding a seat.  It has become a regular go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Every meal we've had here has been great.   Best Philly Cheese Steak I've ever had. You would never expect that from a Mediterranean place, but holy cow! I also reccomend the shawarma sandwich.   We've tried many of the ka-bob entrees and my favorite is probably the kafta, which are like Mediterranean meatballs. They have so much flavor, and are just so different than anything I'm used to eating. The beef and chicken are fine, but I definitely liked the kafta more. You also get a ton of rice and hummus and a huge pita for dipping. It's very filling, and the rice and hummus are both fantastic. I was licking my plate at the end, I'm not gonna lie.   The Mediterranean Sampler is a great way to try different types of sides. It's 8.99 and comes with Kibbie, Meat Pie, Spinach Pie, and two Dawali. I'd never even heard of a Kibbie, and it was sooooo delicious. I'm going to order one every single time I go there from now on.   Staff is really friendly! The manager was giving us samples, which is a nice touch. I appreciate the little things like that."}
{"text":"Excellent. I got the Veggie Platter and the hummus was amazing. Great falafel, really great tabouli."}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich is great and the basmati rice is good but not all items are created equally.  Based on my experience, they do not closely watch their online orders, so I would recommend calling instead."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding I love it so much and cook he was very friendly and fast and was great food I can't tell u how much I love it if u ask me u will go again I will see yessssssssssssssssssssssssssss I have a vegetable tagen and lamp shops and shish kofta  Thank u for amazing food"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. First, run by really nice people. I like coming here because I always am treated politely and get a smile. Nice!  Second we have truly enjoyed the food every visit. Delicious and a good value for the money. Their appetizers include an excellent kibbe. Worth trying. Their kebabs are consistently good. The rice is always well prepared and seasoned.  Really happy this is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is really a cute little place with a very friendly and attentive staff. The environment is clean and quiet so it is a good place to get away from over crowded eateries and not feel rushed. Our food arrived quickly and my husband & I enjoyed the food and were happy with the prices.    However, I really didn't like the  BABA GHANOUSH, it had a weird texture and large slices of spongy eggplant in it instead of being blended. It also just didn't taste good, very bland and disappointing. Yet I loved my BASMATI RICE & my husband couldn't get enough of the gyro platter.    It's worth checking out again, I heard there french fries are some of the best around so I can't wait to give them another try!"}
{"text":"Food was really fresh and tasted great.  They are reasonably priced as well.  We will be returning and bringing friends. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Service is really friendly. Everything we have had is excellent. Tabouli is great and I love their falafel. Husband loves the spicy beef."}
{"text":"I love La Shish!  I go there at least once a week, and sometimes more than that!  The food is so fresh and seasoned so well.  It's great that they're not a chain restaurant!  My favorite are the chicken dishes and the falafel sandwiches.  I've turned a lot of people onto this place and they've always been very satisfied.  I hope La Shish will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when we went to this restaurant turns out it was very good they had a nice kids menu if your children are not interested in eating some of the Middle Eastern inspire foods. I ate the chicken kebab which was very good with Basmati rice I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"La shish is our favorite place to eat and we dine out alot! The owner is kind and a great cook. The philly cheesesteak sandwich is the best anywhere and ive traveled all over the U.S. The food is made fresh so be patient.  Definitly a must go visit!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here on our weekly Random Dining Adventure; rules: neither of us has eaten there before.  This was a definite WIN.  La Shish was spotlessly clean and had about a zillion open tables.  The food came out hot and obviously very freshly made.   I had a kebab with tabbouleh and rice;  Hubby had a gyro platter. He's never been a hummus fan so I stole all of his. Oh my God,  the food was just jumping into my mouth! Excellent seasonings, tender meats,  fresh vegetables. Fabulous.  The place should have been packed with a line waiting outside. Truly GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"Just got take out from there and food was awesome! We got the lamb kebobs & chicken kebobs with hummus and rice. The baklava was good too! We will be back"}
