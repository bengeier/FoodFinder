{"text":"Service was good but I really disliked the ambience and decoration. Gohan looks like a run down bar that was hardly adapted to be a sushi restaurant. The quality of the food was very poor too, the rolls did not have anything special about them, for the cost you can do much better in Calgary. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They just opened recently and we were a bit cautious in the beginning, but the sushi itself - wow, so good! I prefer non raw fish food - so try only cali rolls and veggie rolls, but they actually put real crab meat in them and it taste delicious!  One side back is the ambiance, it's still feels like it's a night club and the music is weird most of the time. So we generally go there just to get some tasty sushi :)"}
{"text":"Good food - solid portions, fresh fish, and sauces were tasty. However, it took almost 90 minutes for lunch (two of us ordered three rolls and some sashimi). Server didn't bring the bill quickly, even though we said we were (by then), in a hurry. A bit pricey too."}
{"text":"Went there the other day for lunch. Waited 10 minutes for water, waited another 40 minutes for food. When the table beside us mentioned that they were waiting over an hour for food, we decided to leave because our lunch break was over. We ended up picking up our lunch from a food truck.   Not worth going unless you like slow service."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to finally pop in on this place and it was a treat.  The environment and ambience is much like a modern tokyo house where you know the fun stuff happens after dark.   I came during an after work jaunt by myself and tried a few items from the monster menu.  The motoyaki is to die for as was all the other items I nibbled on.  Service was fast, friendly, and their patio overlooking the street was very pleasant.    The kicker was that i started talking to a friendly employee there who was making sure i was taken care of and happy with my experience.  Turned out to be the owner whom totally added to my visit.    I would definitely check this place out again with friends and the little lady.  Apparently this place is a very cool hot spot on weekends too, good music?  Amazing food? Fun staff?  Im in!"}
{"text":"Some hits, mostly misses.  It is only worthwhile to dine here if you have a Groupon.  The prices are quite high, even higher than some of the favorite, traditional Japanese spots in the city yet I can't say it tastes better.  Honestly, I have no idea what everyone is raving about. Generous portions? Well, if you're charging more than what the average sushi restaurant charges for the same cut of fish, the portion is expected to be larger as well.  My 2 star rating goes to the really good service and some of the food was definitely ok, but yeah, you can definitely get better Japanese food for less at many other places..."}
{"text":"I came here due to some positive reviews on Urbanspoon and a Groupon. My husband I were pleasantly surprised by the food and service.   First off, props to Melissa, our server. She is one of the nicest and most awesome servers I've met in Calgary. She was so sweet, even to the high maintenance couple next to us, who was also using a Groupon but insisted first on water, no ice with a lemon wedge, then a fork to squash each piece of maki before eating it, then demanding a knife. I'm guessing this was her first time eating sushi.  The food was delicious. Do get the scallop and prawn motoyaki. Sensual, seaweed is sandwiched between the two pieces of seafood, wrapped in a not too heavy creamy sauce.   The ramen was delicious, the egg was perfectly poached. The ramen itself was a little too cooked for me, but it was still good. The broth was milky and not overpowering. Portion was filling. Next time, I want to try the seafood yakiudon.   The dynamite roll was pretty average for $8.00. However, our neighbours soft shell crab maki looked awesome. I'll order that next.  The scallop in the scallop and red tuna appy was the freshest I tasted... EVER. And I'm in Calgary, so double impressed.   The sushi pizza was yummy, but you have to love deep fried food to enjoy it. The rice, despite being deep-fried, wasn't gummy. If you are a fan of the burger on rice patty at Carino, do try Gohan's version.   The prices are higher than I'm use to paying. With the groupon, and Thursday half price appies and $5.25 Sapporo, the meal was a very good deal."}
{"text":"I ate here when it first opened. Everything tasted ok, nothing spectacular. It was pretty pricey compared with everywhere in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but nothing too special. Super pricy, so wouldnt consider the food is worth the price. It is at a convenient location and the atmosphere was really nice. The service was fine - got my order wrong, and although apologized and said we can switch, the tone wasn't really saying she wants to do the switch...it was average experience"}
{"text":"A solid sushi experience. Best part? Super generous slabs of sashimi. In a world where portion sizes and price per piece seem to be getting out of touch, Gohan truly delivers. Their rolls are gargantuan as well, so keep that in mind when you're ordering! We've been back twice now and tried the ramen as well, which while they don't make their own noodles, is still creamy broth chock full of comforting goodness.  The appearance of Gohan is quaint, with lots of red accents. It serves as a nightclub as well, so it is a bit dinged up, but overall has a nice modern appeal. They also offer body sushi, which might pique your interest if you are hosting a big event.  Overall, if you're in the area, check it out. Nothing out of this world amazing, but you won't feel swindled and it's a sure bet."}
