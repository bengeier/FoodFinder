{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great coffee, food, and service. Chèvre Avacado panini and an iced toddy is a new weekend habit."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on the coffee or the food, but after waiting over 10 mins to be helped or even acknowledged by the staff we left. Will never go back how tough is it to say, \"Hi, will be with you in a minute\" but nope they just kept doing what they are doing."}
{"text":"I love that these folks are offering an alternative to the Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts out there.  My new favorite morning treat is walking with my son in his stroller to the Bold Roost. The coffee is excellent and well priced. The sandwiches are well made and tasty. The only thing preventing me from a five star review is the entertainment there on certain days. They have at least one singer/pianist who seriously needs to either stop singing or at least turn the volume way down. I wanted to hang out there one Sunday, but the dying cat sounds of the singer ran me off."}
{"text":"First off, the product itself (coffee, food, etc.) is good, so that's why B.R. gets more than one star. The major issue has always been service and as of today, it's now also the atmosphere. 

Service: I'm hesitant coming here when I'm in any kind of hurry. It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes on avg., even for simple espresso orders. Staff is very friendly so that's a plus, but there's no sense of urgency. I'm ok with the chilled, laid back speed on the weekends but not during the week. I was able to look past that until today...

Atmosphere: it's a mid week morning and the parking lot is packed (unusual for this center). Turns out that it's a bicyclist meet up. Thankfully only a couple riders stopped in for coffee at the time I showed up, so aside from lack of parking spots, it was no big deal at first. 

But here's where it rubbed me the wrong way - turns out several cars must have also belonged to a bible study group that commandeered the coffee shop. Nearly all tables were taken, formed into a circle by men reading scripture out loud to each other. I have no problem with people demonstrating their religious preferences, but please don't hold mass in the middle of a small restaurant or retail establishment. It's uncomfortable & annoying. There's not a lot of room, so as a customer, what direction do you look while waiting for your order? 
Just so I could avoid looking nosey, I had my back facing them, so I'm sure they had a nice eye level view, given I was practically in their space while waiting. So, should I have watched them awkwardly, like I'm getting into their business? Maybe invite myself into the group? Maybe I should've waited outside? 

It seemed like the barista was hesitant to make any noise & had a comical look on his face when he had to chip away at the ice for my drink because the guy leading the discussion started yelling over the noise. After handing my drink over, the barista sheepishly whispered to have a good day. 

I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. There was a bottle of RumChata sitting on the coffee bar, while a few feet away a large group of people prayed. 
The last small coffee shop that I used to frequent allowed for bible studies in the middle of the shop and they eventually went out of business. I think it's because they had an identity crisis, trying to be both a fun, laid back shop but then it was serious & quiet with the study going on, so you never knew what to expect.

If BR wants to survive, they need to figure out their identity & put a stake in the ground. If they want to be a religious coffee shop, by all means go for it. I have no problem with that. But then put away the RumChata... actually stop selling alcohol altogether. If you want to be a progressive coffee shop, go back to playing Bob Marley.

You can't be everything to everyone or you please no one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place! The first time I went in was during their first week of being open. That visit was good.. The owners were great, the staff was friendly, but their drinks weren't quite up to par yet. I decided to give them another try though, and boy am I glad I did! They've definitely perfected their drinks and perform with consistency now that they've had a chance to work out the kinks in their new business. My caramel macchiato is always on point, as I have become a regular. I have only had the chance to try one panini (not sure of the name) but I was pleasantly surprised! It was very good and even came with a pickle on the side. 

To anyone who had a bad first experience, I strongly advise you give these guys another chance. They've really stepped up to the plate over the past few weeks. I'm excited to see where they go from here!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to the Bold Roost months ago when it was still cool outside. I had a regular roast coffee and my boyfriend had the salted caramel blended coffee of some sort - I didn't pay much attention as I don't care much for sweets. But my coffee was wonderful and I actually had a sip of his and it was delicious! 

The staff was very friendly and polite; informative about the menu and chatted with me when I asked questions about the new place. The interior was VERY clean. You could tell it was still a little new from the sparse decor, but certainly coming together. 

I dropped by the other day on a hurried lunch break to try one of their sandwiches and I was very impressed. I got the TTBA panini and it was delicious. Took  a few minutes to come out, but I could see the cook in the back working very carefully.  It's a great, locally owned alternative and has a very welcoming and quiet 'coffee shop' vibe. I love supporting local business and I will definitely be back!

Great job, Bold Roost!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving it four is bc they forgot to bring me my order. people there were very nice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Usually quiet which I like for working. The staff and owners are very friendly. Coffee is good, not the best, but totally worth it if you are hanging out at the place. If you are looking for a great atmosphere to work, talk, read and have coffee. If you want to come in quick and take a coffee to go- this may not be your place. My favorite drink is the cold brew."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stumbled into this place on accident and had excellent food, coffee, music and service. This is the cool little coffee shop that you want to be sitting in on a rainy day... We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am sitting here and drinking an Americano right now and it is absolutely excellent.  Atmosphere is mellow cool music local art on the wall it's like a real coffee shop instead of Starbucks AKA The Burger King of coffee.  I don't do all the sugar or flavored drinks so I cannot comment on those but I have always believed that an Americano is the best way to sample espresso anyway.  Guy working the counter is extremely friendly. I will definitely be back.  Spoke for awhile with one of the owners.  She was extremely engaging.   This is a real place with real soul.  Cannot recommend it highly enough if you like coffee in a mellow setting."}
{"text":"Having read the one star reviews - I do believe they are being harsh.  The owners are a young couple (I have been in here twice), they don't have owner stickers on, but young is how I would describe them.  This is their first venture into owning their own business, and this place will continue to improve as time goes along.
So if you have tried them, give them another chance and if you have not, come on in."}
{"text":"My buddy told me to try this place so we rolled up there. I was expecting Starbucks prices, but didn't expect it to be so pricey. I ordered a medium iced coffee / latte and a breakfast panini. The coffee was delicious and the panini was awesome! Total price without the tip was over $13. The atmosphere was cool. Cool relaxing music as well. Also, the staff seemed friendly. My only gripe is the price."}
{"text":"Okay. Let me tell you something about The Bold Roost. It opened two weeks ago. Two weeks ago and it already is my favorite place in my area. You walk in here and the employees immediately treat you like family. Always asking me how I am with a smile on their face as soon as I walk in. I get my usual tea or caramel based drink and sit down. It's defiantly a coffee shop vibe here. Lounge chairs with wifi. Relaxing without a doubt. They have my drink ready quick and will always ask me how it is and tend to every catered need. As always, it's amazing. The best expresso of all time. People here are friendly and are up for a chat whenever. A great time whenever I come here. So, please, if you are looking for great customer service, amazing drinks, paninis, and overall an amazing experience come to The Bold Roost. It's just starting as an upcoming coffee shop and it's already amazing. It can only get better too! Overall, I'm proud to say my family will be a regular here for a very long time to come. Five stars and good luck Bold Roost!!!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee. And very comfortable inside too. Relaxing. Need to visit and hang out anytime. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"I met the owners last night, they are usually working, nice, down to earth people. The coffee and lattes are delicious!  I get the sugar free vanilla latte and I love that it's not too sweet. I have only tried their breakfast panini and I give that an A+. Also, I was very impressed with their organic wine selection."}
{"text":"I have been to The Bold Roost twice now. first on the grand opening and then a few weeks ago. There were some cons the fist time that i went and i probably would have given a lower review but before i jumped to conclusions (it was only their first day ever) i went back and tried it again. They have grown so much since they have first opened, there are more art on the walls and they have worked out many of the kinks with their food. And the staff is very friendly and if you have any problems or suggestions they are highly open to hear you and will go back and tell the whole staff what they need to fix. all in all The Bold Roost is good and if it continues to grow at the rate that they are they will be one of the best in the whole pheonix area."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their employee. I think his name was Morgan. He was awesome! Hardworking, friendly (even though it was crazy busy) and just an all around great employee! More businesses should have employees like him. I will be coming back due to his excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from the moment you walk in to when you get your beveridge or meal. Have the best Oreo smoothie I've ever had along with options of using almond milk to Supplement for reg milk. Super friendly staff and a  great place for quiet spot to get some work done. My husband doesn't even like tuna and he ate my entire sandwich along with my 3 year Old son who tends to be a picky eater as well. Very impressed we go there about once a week now"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when I walked into the Bold Roost for the first time.  Its quaint, simple and friendly.  I like supporting smaller businesses, especially coffee shops.  I was a Starbucks employee for 4 years.

The first time I came in here there was no one here, my first impression was that it was a new place, without a client base yet.  However the owner was super friendly, and suggested the Huevos Verde sandwich after my workout, because of the protein content.  It was a delicious sandwich, and the black iced tea that I ordered was perfect.  After about an hour, there were a couple of other students in the shop studying.  Its definitely a college atmosphere.  

The second time I came here, a gentleman working suggested the TTBA sandwich, and again, a win!  They really prepare their sandwiches well.  

The music here is different depending on what employee is working, which I really enjoy.  Right now some trance music is playing, yesterday was Sublime and Bob Marley, 2 days ago was country.

If you are looking for a friendly coffee shop, where they bring your drink to your table, and actually try to learn your name, The Bost Roost is the place for you.

(Also, your 10th drink free isnt a bad deal either)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick visit. Shared a panini, last one on menu- Italian, and a coffee/tea with the hubby. The customer service was great, he recommended a sandwich for us and brought it out in separate baskets. It's pretty comfy in there, plenty of couches and tables. Panini was yummy, lots of meat and cheese."}
{"text":"Great owners, pretty good coffee, delicious breakfasts, though maybe a little expensive. A cozy place to sit and read or socialize in very comfortable recliners.  If you are a musician you will feel especially at home here.  There's a piano, acoustic and electric guitars, and drums for customers to play if they wish.  This place often gets bible groups, but they seem harmless.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I am a medical student who was looking for a great coffee shop to study at that wasn't a Starbucks. This place fit the bill. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. Their paninis are great and they have a good assortment of hot/cold/blended beverages. They have better WiFi than Starbucks and enough plugins to support my needs as well as my friends. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes supporting local businesses. They are always playing good music which helps establish an excellent coffee shop vibe. Stop on in, I will probably be there studying!"}
{"text":"Initially I was excited....a coffee shop in Gilbert that serves Cartel! Not so fast.  The decaf espresso is a substandard mass produced bag you might pick up at Walmart Supercenter. The barista....and I use that term loosely, couldn't understand why I might be a little upset that I was getting a 32 cent cup of coffee when I paid almost $3 for a cup of Cartel I didn't get."}
{"text":"Good local place.. Ive only been once, the Carmel Macchiato was great and had me wired all day. Good friendly service. Has a local owned feel, not a modern chain feel to it.
Close to my house so Ill go again."}
{"text":"Don't go here to read, study, or enjoy a quiet cup of coffee.  A big VERY LOUD table of obnoxious support group people move in and take over. 
They don't care how much their yelling bothers everyone around them.  The owners do nothing about it.   The owners probably like the one big table.  
However you can see everyone else file out as they reach their boiling point.  It is so rude and inconsiderate.  
Don't go here."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of local business and wanting to find a \"coffee house\" that you can sit and feel somewhat at home.  Personally, I like the big comfortable chairs. They also have a small stage set up where anyone can play guitar, piano, drum and with a mic to bust out in song!  As a local hometown coffee place, the BOLD ROOST is heading in the right direction.  And Kudos to the coffee and panini!  I will only bring up one negative...the music was a little loud.  Otherwise, try it out...you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Gem of a coffee place that's been right around the corner from where I live and I just discovered it. This cafe has an awesome interior with comfortable chairs and couches, in addition to a recliner! The artwork and the instruments (including a piano) makes me crave for live performers while I do busy work. It's family owned and the owners are super sweet and friendly. I ordered a hot chai latte and my friend got a green tea frap. The chai was not the best but it was great, especially for the price. The green tea latte was a little lighter than usual for her. I look forward to coming here often when I need to be productive!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite I love coming here. The food is good. The drinks are good. The music is good. The environment is awesome. It's quiet here unless someone is playing their guitar or piano. There's a studying area here also. Five stars"}
{"text":"Bold Roost is a local gem. I stop in for a coffee and a muffin. Sometimes I hang and work on the laptop, sometimes I run out....either way it's always a great experience. The service is impeccable and the food is really outstanding. Skip the Seattle siren for a day and try this place out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I feel it's overpriced. But I guess,what coffee shop isn't. $8 for a tiny. Sandwich feels like too much. The young man working was very nice and helpful. You can tell this place has a strong local following as everyone seems to know the workers."}
{"text":"I have been to the Bold Roost several times since it opened, and I think it's some of the best coffee in Gilbert. Not always the fastest service, but you can tell they are trying. We've also tried a couple of the paninis and thought they were pretty good."}
{"text":"One of the best in town...good service, personal service, quiet, relaxing, close to everything. Best yet, good coffee."}
{"text":"Place is ok... For Gilbert. Haha. They had some guy singing horribly all night. He was so bad. So so bad. Sam Braxton or something. More like Sam \"CRAP-ston\". Right?"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment 4 times now and the quality of the coffee  and service was excellent. The barista even cooked up a special cup for my wife who likes her coffee not to strong and black. My wife was impressed. I haven't eaten lunch here yet but our daughter has and said it was excellent ! I highly recommend this local business. They use beans from a local roaster too- Matador. They also sell beans for home use. Great place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing cup of coffee this is the place!  My wife and I never agree on coffee, yet we both love a plain cup of Joe at the Bold Roost.  Some other reviews are misleading, this is a coffee place with breakfast sandwiches, not a breakfast menu.  Nothing for the kids to eat so we enjoyed the coffee and headed out."}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious. Breakfast sandwich was freshly made and also good. Service is friendly.  

Decor is very hipster coffee house, music playing is all stuff I liked but haven't listened too in a decade or more. Free wifi. Not the mad house you find at any Starbucks. 

I'm coming back, probably often."}
{"text":"I went back to the Bold Roost yesterday, and I can see they are taking feedback to heart! 

There is some change in the layout with a new booth cutting across the middle of the space to help divide it up a bit, and also a stage being put up to the left of the entrance for live music. There was also a little case with Muffins, Bagels, and a rack with Potato Chips, so there are now more options regarding food selection.

Thanks for taking the time to listen and grow. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time. This place needs alot of help. The tables were sticky, the servings small. The prices high. The food quality mediocre. Did not try the coffee... only the paninis. I think they will have a hard time competing with The Spot restaurant that is almost next door."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. I go there frequently to work on my computer. I love the atmosphere. The sayings that people write on the walls are profound and in a lot of cases really funny. Their sandwiches are very good (especially the breakfast sandwiches!) and the coffee!! So good. And the service is always very friendly and efficient. Great place to sit and get some things done."}
{"text":"This place just opened up across the street from me, and all I can say (in my best Oprah voice) is \"THEY SERVE CARTELLLLLLLLLLLLL!\"

That's right, those awesome Cartel beans that I pay through the nose for are being brewed right across the street. I got a cappuccino during their grand opening, and it was perfection. I also got a chance to chat with the owners who are very warm and engaging. 

I haven't tried any of their food offerings yet. When I do, I will update my review accordingly.

I encourage everyone in the area to give this local, independent coffee shop a shot."}
{"text":"the barista james made the hell outta my long island, definitely made a regular out of me!! kudos to james, and the management for hiring james! also, you guys should do your version of a punch card!! i'd love to have one in my wallet! thank you again!"}
{"text":"Green tea frappe = shhhhhhh so good omggg
Red velvet cupcake = could you please not put your delicious cupcakes out on display for my lack of willpower and excess of impulse buys?"}
{"text":"Local, fresh and friendly staff. Better than those chain coffee shops. Quite place to use wifi while drinking coffee. Can't comment on their food, but coffee is great. Owners are often there and make great conversation while preparing your drinks."}
{"text":"I've grown to really like this place. Good coffee. Love their chai. Nearby which is convenient."}
{"text":"So I had a doctors appointment early this morning. Shockingly, traffic was in my favor and I got here early - so what's a girl to do?  Amazingly enough, there was a spiritual glow coming from the general area of my doctors office - wait?  What is that?  A COFFEE SHOP next door?!  I thought it was too good to be true..... alas, it was. 

We walked in to a pretty hipster place with cool art, a piano, and more overused sofas/recliners than you can count. It kind of looked like the Goodwill's Rejects section  - really, not cute. 

Our barista was beyond rude - he couldn't be bothered to raise his eyes, say good morning, or thank me for our order. There was literally no one else he was \"serving\" at the time. At one point I thought maybe it was part of this place's \"ambience\" - nope. I think our barista just couldn't millennial today. 

It took (yes, we timed it), 9 minutes to get my small cafe mocha that was okay I guess. It tastes like chocolate milk with a little coffee flavor on the finish. 

At the end of the day, if you're going to advertise yourself as \"bold\", then maybe you should hire and serve BOLDLY. There are too many coffee places that will take my money.  

I gave two stars, not one, because I liked that you serve alcohol in the evening. Other than that, the experience was weak. Like your baristas' personalities and your coffee."}
{"text":"Had iced latte very creamy and coffee taste perfect.  The panini's are awesome!!!  Will go again:) cute atmosphere"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. It was dead  but has a cute coffee shop vibe. I tried the Ethiopian roast they had on perk and it was really good. I do not like the fact when you pay by debit, the employee does it for you and the signature pad asks if you want to tip. I usually do not tip coffee places since most of the time I only order black and they are providing a product not a service. Customers do not like being asked to tip when tipping in these establishments is debateable anyways. I wish they would change this."}
{"text":"DONT LOOK ANY FURTHER JUST COME HERE ! ! KETO / LOW CARB FRIENDLY ! !
(Yes 2 explanation marks worthy) 

I am visiting AZ for a few weeks and just started the KETO PLAN a month and a half  and I have lost 43 lbs so staying on plan was very important to me. 

I called 5 coffee shops and the first 4 didn't even know what Bulletproof Coffee was (KETO PLAN COFFEE) I called Bold Roast and Libby knew exactly what it was and invited me in to the store, she has a great business acumen. 

I arrived and she made me a Sugar Free Vanilla Bulletproof w/ heave cream, and it tastes even better than I make at home. Libby took the time to go over the menu and we discussed I was from out of town and she then offered the use of the internet for me. I work from home and while in AZ this will be home base. 

I then ordered an egg bowl and Brandon (owner/chef) made me a great egg scramble with feta and avocado. (Keeps me on the KEYO plan) Brandon delivered it to my table and had a great personality and thanked me for coming in. Food was delicious and the coffee wonderful. The will see me every weekday morning I'm here. 

THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD.  

I wish you the best of luck in your venture."}
{"text":"Great coffee. I prefer it over Starbucks. 

As others have said, the place is missing the coffee shop vibe. When I stop in, its early in the morning on my way to work so I can over look it for the decent cup 'o joe."}
{"text":"Great coffee (got a Cartel Med roast) at a reasonable price. 16oz for $1.90. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Great cafe! Flavorful coffee and perfect sandwiches. Solid atmosphere. Love this local Gilbert business."}
{"text":"Found this coffee shop by searching \"best places to study Gilbert.\" And it's become my new favorite place to grab good food, amazing coffee and quickly enter a state of flow. I get so much work done here haha. Try their frappucinos. I've never had anything that could match Starbucks frappucinos and Bold Roost's fraps are BETTER in my opinion. They also make a bomb bullet proof coffee if you need a sustainable boost to get you through the afternoon. So grateful to have found this place."}
{"text":"I really like supporting local business, so to the bold roost I say........work on your Americano and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is friendly,  owners are great. I'm always greeted and they always acknowledge me when I leave.  
I usually get a coffee, sometimes an Americano and I have no complaints.  
Their menu is growing so I'll be eating some items to try.
Overall all, this is my \"Cheers\" and I enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love supporting small businesses but for some reason I keep giving this place a try and it keeps disappointing me. The girl working was very dull, monotone, no sense of urgency at all. It's sad because I would like to give a better review if I had great customer service. This place used to be really good with great workers. Even though every time I come the food takes an extraordinarily long time the food comes up good. This time the menu has changed. The menu sounded very appetizing yet the food took a very long time, came out cold, and the quality had drastically decreased. There was no side to it either such as potatoes it was just a small sad breakfast sandwich. The egg wasn't cracked on a stove up tasting...I enjoy the environment being cozy maybe a place to have a coffee but not for food or the customer service at least the time that I was there."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic, the coffee and food is great and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing! A great plane to study, catch up with friends or just grab a quick bite to go! It's a wonderful place to spend some time"}
{"text":"This is our weekend morning go-to. We are always greeted with friendly service, great food, delicious coffee, and a vibe that I totally enjoy. 

I really appreciate their selection of milk substitutions (almond, coconut, soy). Starbucks could learn a thing or two from the Roost. 

I hope this local business sticks around for a long while."}
{"text":"Went there this morning with my fiancé as a breakfast date before work... Took 30 minutes for 2 coffees and a sandwich I was almost late for work. The place looked cool and the guy was nice but there needs to be more people than just one guy. My coldbrew coffee couldnt be saved by creamer or sugar so I ditched it and went to Starbucks. Will give this place another try but ill order something else"}
{"text":"Gilbert's best kept secret! Our favorite place to study and chat. Free Wifi, great coffee and adorable ambience. Love the Roost!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Every time I enter the doors I am welcomed and they always have a huge smile on their faces. Prices are reasonable and the coffee is fantastic! Gotta love coffee on a bad morning."}
{"text":"I'm seldom in the East Valley. That said, I needed to drop someone at the airport in Mesa. I figured since I was in Mesa I would meet with some of my readers to sign some books. I couldn't find the coffee house I initially intended to sign at, even with a Mapquest map. Instead I came across this establishment. 

Being an author, I spend quite a bit of time in quite a few coffee shops around the valley. My default brew at any new new place I try is the Americano bold roast.

Without exaggeration, Bold Roost is one of the more obnoxious coffee houses I've ever been to (including Starbucks, which I detest). First, the Americano was luke warm, overly bitter (even with 3 sugars and cream), and tasted as if it was made with tap water. Second, the service was absent, the two young women were more interested in talking to each other than following up. Lastly and most importantly (to me), the MUSIC was obnoxiously loud and poorly selected. When I arrived I was greeted with club music - pounding bass with screaming or chanting. Since I needed to stay a while I ended up listening to reggae. I can appreciate almost any genre of music for an hour or two. But the bass and chanting and the consistently loud, inescapable volume of the \"music\" was too obnoxious to allow me to concentrate on writing. If I wasn't meeting people I would have left after ten minutes.

I'm sticking it out until my readers get here. After that I hope never to see this place again. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop! It's so beautiful inside, so full of creativity and inspiration! Also the music is always on point with my mood and the coffee is really good.... not in the mood for coffee? That's ok, they also have a full bar ;) 

If I were to ever own my own coffee house I'd want it to be like this one!"}
{"text":"Bold Roost is my new spot for coffee. Great coffee, delicious sandwiches and a very pleasant environment to unwind. The folks behind the counter are always very nice and my son loves the lemonade and the muffins. Great local coffee shop."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised as I had my doubts wandering into a coffee shop in a suburban office complex located in between an insurance office and a doctor's office. The employees were super friendly, the drinks were great and they have some nice food options. Just wish it was a little less cramped and dark inside and their little patio had a bit more ambiance. Overall, they did an amazing job with what they had to work with. Definitely give them a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a coffee snob, but I wanted to try something new and since this place is right across the street, I figured I'd give it a try. It's got a cool atmosphere, the customer service was okay, the coffee wasn't the greatest and the food was decent. 

When I walked in, there was 4 women sitting right up front, whom I assumed were regular customers like me. Then the guy working the counter informs me that if I talk to them, since they're from some local small business chamber, I get some deal...my response is clearly in earshot of these women almost forcing me to say yes. And let's be honest, on a Saturday morning, I don't want to talk to anyone, even if it saves me $5. Embarrassed, I said \"No, thanks\". Look, I'm all for supporting local small businesses, but this felt more like a solicitation and it made it uncomfortable.

I also mentioned it was my first time, so I was hoping for a run down on what I should expect my coffee to taste like. That's usually what happens when you go to other local places...but instead they just asked if I wanted dark or light...

Overall, it wasn't the worst experience I've ever had, but it wasn't the greatest, so I may give it another try during the week."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick drink this morning with my husband. I ordered a latte macchiato and my husband, a mocha. Our drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time and they were quite tasty. The guy behind the counter was friendly and gave a quick answer to a question that I had so no issues with the service.
The decor is pretty much the reason I knocked off a star. Everything is just sort of meh and unorganized. I think it has a lot of potential and would suggest they google image \"artsy coffee shops\" to get some more inspiration. I don't think it would take much to spruce the place up.
Bottom line- I'll go back. It's a nice change of pace from the whole \"pleasantville\" feel of Gilbert. Maybe next time I'll try their food!"}
{"text":"Good music, good coffee, great place to study! 

Coffee: I got a iced hazelnut coffee. Felt slightly rushed to order as no one else was in the shop and both servers were waiting on me. I wish I had a bit more time to consider my order but now I know for next time. The coffee is all right but the service is great.

Parking: plenty of parking outside! 

Wifi: Log on to cisco and enter the password. It's a bit slower than normal so you might not be able to binge watch on Netflix if there are others around. 

Atmosphere: The music is great! Classic 2000s/late 90s mixed in with a few of the recent hits. Loving the selection. The wall art is eclectic filled with small tips and inspirational life quotes. Pretty interesting when you're staring off into space. Couches in the center if you feel like lounging or taking a nap. 

Outlets: tons of outlets along the wall where most of the tables and chairs are located. And I must say, these chairs are some of the comfiest I've sat in."}
{"text":"Hands down, better than Starbucks! Locally owned and operated coffee shop... What more can one ask for? The atmosphere is great, the staff is educated  on products. Oh and the coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the whole ambiance is \"hipster chill\" without being pretentious. They have inspiring graffiti and art on the walls. It's a great place to study or hang out. They have alcoholic beverages, including beer but also brunch drinks. This just become my new favorite coffee place."}
{"text":"When I stepped foot into this coffee shop, I was very excited to taste everything...cute chalk board menus do that to me. There's a grand piano in the corner, local art hung on the walls, super comfy chairs arranged in a living room style setting, as well as fine tables. 

The food was good, I ordered two breakfast sandwiches. They had a very gourmet/artisan flavor. Delicious! 
The coffee I ordered was alright, nothing to go out of my way for. If anything if come here just for the environment. The prices are a bit much for the quality and service."}
{"text":"Went to get my Husband hair done at this little stripe mall , need tea , the hair dresser all bragged about this place .
I walked in and to my amazement , it was the best kept secret . 
They had everything , clean , friendly workers , cute little place , large list of coffees , muffins , cookies . People all sitting chatting in a relaxed atmosphere . Enough tables so not waiting on one if you wanted to sit and wait and drink or eat your food 
I will always come here before getting my hair done ."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for the whole family. Top notch food and service. Kids loved the smoothies, mom loved the gluten sensitive menu and excellent drinks served here."}
{"text":"Finally tried Bold Roost this weekend. We were quite pleased with our coffee and panini sandwiches. I recommend the \"peanut butter cup frappe\" as it is amazing. Nice vibe in this place. More relaxing than Starbuck's to me. The service was great. The person behind counter answered our questions on menu items and was very friendly and courteous. He checked to be sure we liked our coffee drinks and our food. When we left he was sure to say goodbye and thanked us for coming in. I like that kind of place. We will go back again for sure.  The only down side is I might be addicted to that peanut butter cup frappe now."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch, service was great very friendly and helpful with the menu.  My husband had an iced mocha which was good and I had an Italian soda also good.  We both had panini's, loved the fresh local ciabiatta rolls and both were super yummy.  Will definitely be in again."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop that also serves alcohol.

The food is delicious and the atmosphere typically provides a quiet, relaxing experience.
The staff takes pride in their ability to make a great cup of coffee and they are very friendly.

Patrons can either sit at their little bar, sit outside in the little patio area, or lounge on a cushy couch or chair."}
{"text":"First time visit and I will be back.  Friendly and quaint.  If you are into shop local. This is it. Music on Mondays. Lending library and comfy couches.  
Can't believe I have driven by so often and never stopped.  Shame on me. When in the area I will definitely be back.  The barista this morning was so nice"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly service and great coffee and tea!!! I can't wait to go back in the evening ..."}
{"text":"It's the best!! The staff are friendly. I plan to go there more often. Their sandwiches are delicious! The place is cozy and comfortable! Go see the paintings on the wall by my friend who is an artist!"}
{"text":"I dropped into this spot the other day itching for some cold brew.  Parking was easy once we found the place.  Inside is pretty typical hipster coffee shop decor.  I will say, the cold brew was outstandingly good and the breakfast sandwich was solid.  It seemed a little pricey for what we got and the patio left a little to be desired.  I probably won't be back to sit and hang out but will absolutely grab a cold brew to go in the future.  Worth a trip for the quality of the coffee, and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! The atmosphere is so perfect for studying and/or getting work done. There are also counters and standing tables if you prefer that. Food and drink here are also pretty good. I like their teas a lot, but I've never ordered a coffee or espresso drink (it makes me too jittery). One day, while working through lunch, I decided to split a salad and sandwich with my sister. The salad was excellent; I can't pinpoint it, but something about it was special. The vegetables seemed very fresh. Too often, I get a salad from other places and it's underwhelming and soggy, but Bold Roost keeps it fresh. We were also very satisfied with the panini. So, all in all, a great place to get some work done, relax with a book, or enjoy a meal with friends."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's cute, clean, has ample seating, and it's quiet excluding the music on their speaker system. Compared to other coffee shops where we are battling for space, this place has plenty. It doesn't feel like Starbucks or your typical coffee shop but it reminds me of a casual place to sit and do whatever you need to do. I guess it really depends on what you're looking for in terms of ambiance. 

The service is great. The guys here are very courteous. If I owned a store, this is the service I would expect from my employees.

The coffee is really good. I believe they service Cartel coffee.  I got the Caprese panini. The panini was mediocre but everything else made up for that. 

There is free wifi. They sell a few things from local vendors. Lastly, they are a local coffee shop which I love since I'm all about supporting local businesses. I love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the environment this place has easy to study relax get some mommy time the sandwiches are good coffee is great."}
{"text":"We love this place! Best cafe in town!! Staff is so nice and the art work and vibe is awesome# 

They serve beer and have live music too sometimes."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday morning to give this place a shot. Walking in the door you cold tell this store was not ready for business. Secondly it's being managed by a 16 yr old and a group of teens who spent more ime answering their cell phones than taking customer orders. The espresso was terrible and it took them four tries to get four shots out of the machine. The breakfast panini was incorrectly made and had been overlooked. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I really wanted this place to be something. It looks so cool. 

I walked in and it felt awkward. There was no music playing and it just felt stale. I had to ask for them to play something because I wanted to be any where but there. I asked for an iced tea and that went pretty well. Except, it took 15 minutes to make an iced tea. There was only one other person there and I was the only one with an order in. 

I will give this place another chance, but was not overly impressed by what I experienced."}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant for the first time today. Never to return.  Way over priced!  My sandwich was all bread. I had the Caprese panini. Two very thin slices of tomato, 2 very thin slices of cheese and a small iced tea.  (no one even ask if I needed a refill on the tea) Table was sticky and had someone's 'Bobby Pin'  left laying there.  (restaurant practically empty so they could not use 'being busy' as an excuse)  Sad...was hoping for something better.  I think anyone that may have given a great review ONLY had coffee."}
{"text":"Im a coffee junkie but not a snob. The coffee itself is mediocre at best. The service is friendly. Overpriced for what you are getting. Take a pass."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chocolate Strawberry Frapp which was just OK. And a bit pricy at $7. Words cannot describe my wife's disappointment at their Artichoke Heart & Heart of Palm Salad! For $8 there was just a smattering of some leaves. They were so small that we were unable to discern whether it was an artichoke or a palm. We definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The bold roost never disappoints! We have been coming here since the beginning, and we always enjoy the espresso drinks, friendly staff, ambience, and various music."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on our way home from our Saturday morning bike ride. When we arrived there was only one other couple in the place. A few more people arrived after us which the staff did not know how to handle.  The place was run by  high school kids how had no training and with no manager's guidance. Where was the manager/owner? The coffee was horrible. Ordered the chevre avocado. It tasted like the first egg the kid ever made. It was so overcooked it was rubber, no seasoning on the sandwich, and could barely taste the cheese. They owners didn't provide any decor other than steel gray walls. Prices are at least double for the quality and service received. Will never go here again even though it is less than 1/2 mile from my house."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The atmosphere is comfortable and clean.  Comfortable chairs, great food, excellent coffee, books to read, art on the walls for sale by local artists, a piano, friendly staff.. I found my new coffee place.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, my wife and I tried this place which is right around the corner from us. We eat only at independent restaurants so dissing this place is very difficult. Long story short, we went there for a light dinner, \"gourmet panini\" sounded like a perfect reason to try the new place. The turkey tasted like processed turkey loaf, the bacon was unlike anything either of us had ever ate, rubbery, reddish stuff. In a word, awful. First time we had EVER asked for our money back. I felt terrible but it was pathetic. The owners need to act now or the end is near I'm afraid. That is unless the coffee is mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Ok read the reviews about the loud support group. I was not sure what that meant. I think I found out. Not sure if it was a support group but a big group of teenagers. They basically took up the who place. There was a couple guitars on a stand against the wall. The proceeded to remove them and play. One had an amp so loud. This was not planned as there was music playing before and they started playing, so loud and multiple music playing. Not together, one on guitar with amp not playing same as the other guitar.  Also they were just playing around as they really did not know how to play.  They then moved a piano away from the wall and played that. When they moved the piano away they were right on the way of another table. That table of 3 got up and complained to the employees and left. We were only ones left except this group, only staying until we finished our food. We know have house music, 2 guitars and a piano all playing and not together or even good. Not sure why they allow this. We will not be back and I am sure the other people that left will not be either. Also did I mention the group mainly had water bottles brought in, no food and 2-3 had coffee. So not even spending money. Not sure of the logic as a business owner."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona to visit my best friends and I came across this little gem.
Being Cuban and all I can be a bit snobby when it comes to coffee and that being said.
I loved the espresso bar here the coffee was very flavorful and full of aroma.
I was even instructed on how to get the most flavors in my sip.
The Panini's are great as well.
Can't wait to come out to AZ again and sip on some fine espresso from The Bold Roost. And of course to visit with my bfs"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. The service is great and the food is delicious. I highly recommend this place to those who love to support small/independent businesses like this one."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Look forward to stopping in every time I am in there area. Best coffee hands down and friendly staff. Already look forward to the next time I am able to stop in!"}
{"text":"If you're like me and want something besides the same old \"sheep herding\" experience of Starbucks, then you should stop in and give these guys a try. It's my 3rd time in two days! The coffee and lattes are amazing and Taylor even made a modified special Huevos Verdes scramble for me two days in a row! Super friendly and cozy environment. And FYI, they offer great lunch and dinner options AND serve cocktails if that's your thing."}
{"text":"This little cafe has just become cuter & cuter over the last few years. The drinks are amazing and the staff is just so sweet. I think the owners just had an addition to their family and they just have somehow kept the company rock'n and getting better and better. Great job guys, keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Best coffee in town IMO (I just get the bold drip or perk with some cream, and I've had the black iced which was also delish) and good food too.  My favorite coffee shop in town..."}
{"text":"Slooooooow as it goes is being nice. 20 minutes for a frozen drink, and wasn't what I would call busy. He finished making a drink that had been placed before me, the  started the absolute painstaking task of making mine. I honestly don't think he had a clue, as I watched him go back and forth to the blender at least 4 times. Then a couple of girls came in, sat at the bar and started chatting and showing coffee dude their nails, distracting him from being able to finish my drink. 20 minutes later, I left with an overpriced, overiced , underflavored drink. While waiting, I took a seat on the \"shedding\" vinyl sofa, trying to take in what could be a fun vibe. Sniff sniff, then it hit me, the sofa reeks of  body funk. I get having recycled furniture, but, this is quite disgusting. 
The last time it was a great drink made to perfection, today, not so much. Too many coffee shops to choose from to be this underwhelming."}
{"text":"Their hot chocolate is....very hot but lacking on the chocolate. It was the most odd tasting hot chocolate I have ever had. There was absolutely no flavor, it honestly tasted like the material the cup was made out of. Very odd..."}
{"text":"Very chill vibe, and the best damn chai latte you can get. They have artwork and quotes written all over the walls, but nothing there is too much. I am happy every time I go there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and they made a very competent Mocha.  But I was disappointed to see the liquor license application sign in the window, especially for a \"coffee shop\"."}
{"text":"Enjoy a lovely cup o' Joe in a comfortable, relaxed environment at Bold Roost.

I tried a sample of the cold brew which was very smooth light and refreshing but I ultimately decided on an coconut milk iced latte because wanted something a little creamier. The options for non dairy milks include soy, almond and coconut milk. 

The latte tasted OK for the most part, but had a bit of an unpleasant bitter finish after each sip. I tried some of the nana banana drink which was liquid indulgence. It was a great mix of coffee, banana flavor, and chocolate. 

In addition to the few tables and chairs they have some comfortable couches you can sit and relax on. The atmosphere is pleasant and peaceful with lots of art on the walls, and there's even a baby grand piano in the cafe.

Service was friendly and our drinks were made in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"Great staff! They know my order. Super friendly and delicious drinks!! I recommend the macchiato. They have a rewards points program, and you can CALL AHEAD YOUR ORDERS!! This is great for when you are running late. Love this place. I haven't been to Starbucks since we moved to the area. Thanks Bold Roost!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this past Friday to use a restaurant.com gift certificate. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! The atmosphere was interesting and comfortable. Also they have coconut milk as a dairy alternate which is AWESOME. Only issue is pricing I think. It was $21+ for a scramble and a panini with an ice tea. I work at a breakfast place and I just feel like you don't get much for the price. Still delicious food. Music was not loud like other reviews said. My advice is to offer a fresh fruit, breakfast potato, or some other side with the $7.99 meals."}
{"text":"Now before I get \"boos\" and \"hisses\" from this review hear me out. I've come to the Bold Roost many times and although I've only checked in a few times through this program, it doesn't entail how many times I've actually been to this location.

First and foremost; the staff have always been exceptional and kind. When I've had questions, I was given more than enough friendly answers to point me in the right direction of a drink or snack that I would enjoy during my visit. But there always seems to be a problem with the amount of staffing available when I have stopped in. There has never been more than one barista working at a time for the bar or kitchen. Meaning: if someone gets a panini and a drink, that same barista has to prepare the food AND drink. Which can be good if there are only a few people in the shop, but when you have 5-10 waiting, you'll begin to see the problem.

Now this is, in no way, the fault of the employees, mainly the employer or manager/owner. So I know that many of you out in Yelp-land thinks that might be unfair, but it does affect service in a major way. However, there has still only been one and ONLY one employee working every time I've stopped in. Don't know if it is merely coincidence or policy but it's happened during the week and on a Sunday afternoon. 

Second: the coffee is quite delicious. From the bean selection to the availability of additions to any tea, coffee or latte. That's about as simple as it gets. Ask the baristas what might be good, and they'll point you in the right direction with some prodding. 

Next: the food. Although good and delicious to have a casual meal, the selection isn't amazing. Not sure if I'm splitting hairs but if they want this place to be \"more than a coffee shop\" they need to have variety. Or at least switch up the types of food available. Just don't come here for more than snack food. 

And finally I come the layout and atmosphere. Not sure what it is, but the flow and layout of this place just seems \"off\". It has a gorgeous, open window space in the front of the store and clutters it all up with weird furniture spacing and grey walls all over the place. Nothing sucks color out of a spot more than lifeless, unimaginative walls guys. Just something to spruce it up. 

Ultimately this is a great spot to come and do homework or read and wind down. I don't want people to think I hate this place because I don't. It just needs some new design or even a new layout to floor. The atmosphere is casual, but dark. So if they ever changed it around I think it would be immensely improved!"}
{"text":"Had the iced coffee wth mocha and it was great.  Also ate the traditional breakfast panini, it was also great.  Cheese, egg, turkey bacon, and light mustard.  Definitely a coffee house feel.  A few guys using it as their office."}
{"text":"I really like the workers, but most of the times it takes 15-20mins to order and receive my drink(iced latte) even if I'm the only one there!! You get a choice of light or dark roast which I like the option of having. There is a lot of local artwork hung up, a piano, a couple comfy couches, and the standard 2/4 person table and chairs. They have loose leaf teas in flavors I haven't seen anywhere else such as, prickly pear and pomegranate mojito both of which I love to get iced during the summer."}
{"text":"I recently moved here for school, and needed to find a good coffee shop where I could study.  This is by far the best place I have found.  The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.  They gratefully answered all of my questions about their menu, and carried on polite conversation.  

The internet is fast, the music is great, and chairs are comfortable! I enjoyed and iced coffee (toddy) and a caprese panini, and my friend tried an iced chai and TTBA (turkey, turkey bacon, and aioli) panini.  The ingredients were fresh and each sandwich was made to order.  

I am very impressed, and I will continue to support this local business in the future. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I can't drink Starbucks because it makes me sick. I was craving a good chai latte so I figured I would give this place a try. 5 stars all the way! The chai was delicious and I wasn't sick after drinking it. The inside is also so adorable and cozy. I love all of the different art work that is displayed and available to purchase. This will definitely be the place to be when the weather is cold and I want my warm latte!!"}
{"text":"What a cool little trendy place to study, unwind, and hang out with friends. I come her to usually to study and eat some lunch which is so good! I love their paninis. They have guitars that you can use and they sell cocktails and beer as well! Such a cool place and highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place! Staff is so friendly and it's really nice inside! Location is very close to home so and it checks so many boxes for me... But the coffee is TERRIBLE. Full five stars otherwise, but bad coffee is an issue considering they're a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim and I'm so glad I did! First off of the staff is very accommodating very patient while I was ordering. As I begin to look through the menu they have some outstanding offerings I got the chicken bacon avocado panini and it was absolutely delicious! To top off this great experience I found out they have a full bar! I really like the fact that this is a privately owned coffee shop/Cafe/bar."}
{"text":"See photo of poorly prepared drink. cappuccino was served way over temperature and burned the roof of my mouth. Milk was frothed in a manner that showed no training what so ever. Breakfast sandwich resembled what you would get at a convenience store. Owner was more interested in socializing with his employees rather than making sure his business was run well. What a poor example of a cafe."}
{"text":"The people are so friendly that I really don't care about if the food is good or not.  But for those who are wondering, the food is good.  The time from order to service is a little lengthy but the quality is worthy of the wait.  The prices are reflective of the quality."}
{"text":"I was just in the cafe with a friend of mine before we started class, and we were both really excited to try the place. However, when we walked in we were greeted with half hearted smiles and almost no customer service, which is understandable considering its 6 am, but we were the only ones in the entire place. We start looking at the menu and I'm getting confused because there are no prices listed next to any of the selections. When I start asking what's in the meals and what the prices are, I started to understand why. They're extremely over priced and after asking the price of the different size drinks and sandwiches, they started to get disinterested and seemed bored with me. So I place my order and get a 20 oz chai which was about 5 dollars, the most I've ever paid for chai, and an avocado breakfast sand which. My total came out to 15$. What??? For a sandwich and a chai?? Okay at this point I'm annoyed but I'm hungry and class starts in 10 minutes. Okay. So we're waiting and waiting and it took a solid 10 minutes for them to bring out the sandwich. Now we're late, so we rush outside and get to class, open the box, and they gave us the wrong damn sandwich. The one we ordered was supposed to have garlic aioli, goat cheese and avocado. This one had poorly cooked and chewy egg, solid \"melted\" cheddar cheese, and the saddest bacon I've ever seen. It was the equivalent of a mcmuffin from McDonald's. That's bullshit, I payed 15 dollars for something I didn't even order and wasn't even worth the amount. Shitty service and shitty food, only thing good was the chai but way overpriced. Not coming back. Morning shift, or from what I read, all employees should be trained on how to properly provide quality customer service."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually goto The Coffee Shop at Joe's Farm but today we tried The Bold Roost. My first clue shoulda been the lack of customers. Anyway, we order our usual iced coffee Americanos. I was kinda surprised at the $8+ charge but was anticipating a great drink. We were sadly disappointed! Our drinks were so watered down we couldn't be sure there was even any espresso in them. I literally took mine outside looking for a trash can. Ended up dumping them in the bushes. Fear not, we took the cups with us and threw away at The Coffee Shop at Joe's Farm. BTW, two amazing Americanos were $6."}
{"text":"I just came back from there.  They have a fantastic traditional breakfast sandwich cooked on the grill.  Receive good service and coffee."}
{"text":"I'm sure this is a happening place in the evening, but not so wonderful for lunch. Food was meh."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back tomorrow for a coffee!  We tried a couple different sandwiches and an Italian soda for dinner.  Very tasty - wasn't disappointed.  My daughter wanted cheddar cheese on her sandwich but that wasn't a choice (jack, mozzarella, swiss, cream, goat were all choices though).   My husband enjoyed our sandwich but thought it could have used a little more pop of flavor.  I felt it was just the right amount of flavor...it really hit the spot.  Owners were very warm and friendly.  All the beverages were priced nicely ($3.50 for a 20 ounce cappuccino, $2.00 for a 32 ounce soda).  A whole pannini was $7.50 which we shared but my husband and boys could have easily eaten a whole sandwich each.  Side dishes are few (fruit, chips, cookies).  A nice little salad on the side would be nice although you do get a pickle. We will be going back - sandwich was very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! Not sure how I never found this place; definitely a great find to replace Starbucks. I also love the wall full of art :) The amount of food on my plate is plenty for a brunch. The iced tea is fresh and not bitter. If you are looking for some quiet time or alone time (maybe because it's Sunday afternoon), this is the place to be. I enjoyed every moment here!"}
{"text":"The Bold Roost is still new, so perhaps in a month or so of their establishment the kinks in their system will be ironed out.

For me, what I took into consideration with this 2 star ranking was the drink, decor, and customer service.

Drink: I got a cookies and cream smoothie (it was something like that, I can't remember the exact name anymore), and was pleasantly surprised at the sweet taste, not over bearingly sweet. 
cons: chocolate chunks were not blended well, I felt like i was eating crumbled chocolate rather than having a chocolate blended drink. Secondly, cost of the drink was over $4, and the drink very extremely small for that price! 

Decor: as I said, I understand that this cafe is new, and I can see the concept they are going for with their local art hanging on the wall, however, the decor looked like everything was just thrown together. All the art was clustered in one corner, there may have actually been too many chairs and tables because the sitting area felt crowded (and I was the only one there at the time!). so it wasn't as cozy as a one would want from a family run cafe.

Lastly, Customer service: the service was very good. the cashier was nice with his drink recommendation and this was very pleasing :)

Hopefully the Bold Roost will have a better outcome since I always like to give a place a second chance, but hopefully it doesnt empty my wallet for just one drink."}
{"text":"Tough spot to review. Its always empty, but the coffee isnt bad if you go for the light roast. Dont mess with the dark roast, too funky tasting. The feeling you get here is that it has potential but something is missing. I will go back, even though its pretty unremarkable."}
{"text":"The Bold Roost is a flawed coffee shop - and I'll get to that - but first, it must be known that the coffee is good and the service is polite. If you're just looking for a Starbucks replacement to pick up a drink for your morning commute, you could probably argue for a four-star review. As someone said earlier, they use Cartel beans ... and that's a good thing.

But what if you're looking to sit down and enjoy a coffee-shop vibe? Bad choice. Why? It's hard to tell.

Maybe it's the sterile interior that doesn't really give off any sort of culture other than \"pretty cool basement.\" Grey-blue walls, too many oversized leather chairs, not enough art. Not to get hippy on this, but The Bold Roost desperately needs a vibe.

Maybe it's the John Mayer that's been playing four out of the five times I've visited. John Mayer is always a bad choice.

Here's the real problem. When you enter the Bold Roost, nothing strikes you quite like the stale quiet. I'm not an acoustic architect so I don't really have a solution (art to cover noise-reflecting walls? rugs? louder music (not John Mayer)? something tall to break up the room?), but I do know that it's a bit uncomfortable. Uncomfortable enough, in fact, that sitting down and ordering a panini (the entirety of their food offering) seems like something I'd rather not do."}
{"text":"Amazing local business! Very quaint little shop with a great menu. I love the prickly pear tea. They care about quality of ingredients and promote music, dance and reading. No outdoor seating, though."}
{"text":"WOW! I am amazed at how harsh people are being.  So, let's clear up a few things.  

1) The owners are very young and this is their first venture.  Those of you rudely speaking about the teens there were most likely speaking to the owners.
2) They have only been open just over three months.  EVERY business needs some time to adjust and you people giving the negative comments lack a bit of grace for this fact.
3) I had their sandwich and their coffee...as one who generally roasts my own coffee I am rather picky and theirs was good.  Not the best ever, but still very good.  Again, give them some time to figure out types and roasts.  Also, their panini (I had the caprese) and it was very good.  The person who said it was just bread....ummm, you can only put so much cheese, basil, and tomato on a sandwich.
4) The owners are extremely open to helping the community and being involved. 

I felt it important to write this because it seems that the negative type are the first to get on something and moan.  Please give this place a chance and get to know the owners.  They are open to suggestions so ig you have them, feel free to talk to them but be kind."}
{"text":"By far the best place to get a cup of coffee in the east valley. My wife and I drive out of our way to go here, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Siri - did I ever thanked you for recommending that place? THANK YOU! It's coffee. sandwiches and cake - not an adventures line up. Going here will tell you what all the others do wrong. Make a chain out of that right now!"}
{"text":"Had a group project so we decided to meet here. The atmosphere was great. They played good music in the background, it wasn't to loud and annoying. The employees were super friendly. Great place for meetings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a little afternoon pick me up.  I wasn't to impressed.  I had the salted caramel frozen made with coffee.  The salted caramel was yummy however I didn't taste a trace of coffee.  My daughter had the frozen java mocha and didn't like it at all which is different from her finishing all of her mocha frap from Starbucks.  The kids working there were very nice and quick.  If I try it again will probably try an actual coffee drink so I can get a taste of the beans."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing little coffee shop. The coffee was delicious and I had a spinach artichoke panini that was amazing! The service was friendly and quick, and the atmosphere was very laid back!

Thankfully, I live around the corner and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm back. Looks like things have gotten way better. I enjoy stopping here now. That barista isn't there anymore and their toddy is tasty. I can get a 32oz iced toddy and a great blueberry muffin for $6. The usual barista now is great and the business has matured. Try it out today."}
