{"text":"Great place for brunch, sandwiches or a light dinner in Griffintown. Trendy but unassuming, friendly service, great atmosphere. Just one of the reasons why this neighbourhood is very up-and-coming without being pretentious. Recommended."}
{"text":"I love their pizzas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even though I gave5 stars, as my dad said, there is only one thing I could add which is ice cream lol!!!! The OWNER IS VERY POLITE and the staff are very kind! I can't wait to come back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to meet clients at La Bistrote on a regular basis. The owner was very rude on numerous occasions - making us switch tables to accommodate larger parties when the place was completely empty and most notably for berating my clients for not ordering something during a 5 min meeting. It was absolutely embarrassing! We were planning to come back for lunch a few mins later but after this encounter, I will never go back to La Bistrote again. If you don't care about being decent to your customers, don't open a restaurant."}
{"text":"I discovered La Bistrote while attending Social Media Breakfast in Montreal. I've been there a couple of time on my own since. They have great food at great prices. The atmosphere is very nice, very comfortable. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick breakfast and nice healthy lunch, they also have very good coffees. Why I only put three stars? The service, unfortunately. We went twice in two weeks and my friend and I felt almost bad to order... or ask for a glass of water. The girl at the cash/counter never smiles and makes faces when you ask for something that she doesn't really feel like doing - well that's the feeling we got. She gives attitude and only for that reason we won't be coming back.   The other lady, blond girl, is on the other hand very nice and smiles to the customers. Maybe she is the owner...?  Anyway, if they'd hire someone else, they'd probably have more customers!"}
{"text":"Not many vegetarian options but what they do have is quite yummy!  The squash soup, eden salad and antipasto sandwich were all great."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We were a bit worried as we walked in, only 4 other people seated in entire restaurant ! People should really give this place a try! Fresh ingredients, like \"real\" tomatoes, avocados, bacon, fruit! We had quiche, salad, awesome potato wedges, French toast, fruit, coffee...even the pickle was delicious ! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"A la fois \"casual\" et \"cosy\", un endroit qui a une belle personnalité, des tables en bois accueillantes et de bons déjeuners.  Bien adapté pour organiser des événements, simplement."}
{"text":"Very cute place. Food is amazing, employees are very polite and it's cheap. I only came here for brunch and I have to say the potatoes wedges are a must! Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great! The Western sandwich really hits the spot. The chef does an excellent job."}
{"text":"La Bistrote is all about a cozy environment for coffee, tea or a quick lunch  The staff is friendly, and you can't go wrong with the pick of the day.  Griffintown have some good choices, but this is certainly one of the best."}
{"text":"Super bistro! Look cool and eclectic, nice decor! Staff is friendly, refreshing small place to eat! hours of operation are not the best, closed on Saturday and mostly open 8-5pm would recommend it and can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré l'ambiance de ce petit resto ! Un gros bravo pour les pichets de smoothie aux petits fruits qui étaient vraiment délicieux !"}
{"text":"Charmant petit café bistro de Griffintown. J'y ai été pour un événement spécial donc je n'ai pas eu la chance de goûter à leur menu régulier, mais au lieu, j'ai eu droit à plusieurs petites bouchées qui m'ont permis de goûter à une bonne portion de leur menu déjeuner. Et c'est bon, frais et savoureux! La place comme tel a eu look café de campagne et on indique qu'il y a wifi gratuit. Ça m'a définitivement donné le goût d'y retourner pour y passer plus de temps et découvrir leurs spécialités."}
{"text":"Love it here.  We have been coming for years and don't have a single complaint.  I should probably try something other than the Pacific salad but its so good.   Not sure what the real cause of the issue one of the reviewers below had with the owner is,  we have had nothing but good experiences.  I wouldn't pay too much attention to that review."}
