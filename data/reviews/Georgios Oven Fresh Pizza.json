{"text":"It's a chain that markets cheap pizza. Of course it's going to taste like cardboard, but for a large pepperoni pizza for $5 - you really can't complain.

I generally spruce the pizza up a bit when I get home. No complaints. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I went in for a pizza, but what I got was far from that... Now I have had some bad pizza in my time but this place takes the cake. The pizza I ordered (which took them over 20 minutes to make) felt like frozen cardboard. It tasted like it was salvaged from a dumpster, left out for a week in the blazing sun, then put in a fridge for a while, heated up (slightly) and then served. To top it all off the people working that night were rude to us from the get go. This is by the far the worst pizza I have ever had in my entire life. I would rather eat a piece of petrified dog crap then ever assault my body with the garbage they serve there ever again."}
{"text":"This location was the worst meal deal and quality food I have ever had from the franchise over the years. The chicken tasted like it was fried in week's old oil and it was undercooked. The salad I got or what was supposed to be a salad was looked and tasted horrible. We can't forget about the pizza or in our case we wish we did, caused us hours of stomach pain."}
{"text":"My wife stopped in today to get a pizza for lunch- yes it's cheap pizza, but sometimes your in a rush and you have to do what you have to, but this doesn't mean you deserve awful customer service. After getting home, my daughter grabbed her 1st piece, but noticed a hair baked into the pizza, not just laying on top- yes it was baked into the cheese (I know gross right?).  She gets back in the car and takes the pizza back. When arriving my wife tells the girl behind the counter that the pizza she just purchased had hair in it.  The girl say's hair?, like she needs The Webster's Dictionary definition, so my wife opens the box, points to the pizza and says yeah, hair! The girl grabs my wife a new pizza- no apology, no we are so sorry, let me take care of you, no money back, or gift card...nothing.  I guess the absentee owners who run places like this hire cheap staff with no interpersonal skills to take your money and run.  Sad."}
{"text":"Littler Cesar's prices with five star pizza. It really doesn't get much better than Georgios.

We took the pizza home. It was very warm, so we did have to warm it up a little bit. The pizza itself was amazing! We had Sicilian deep dish pizza and the traditional sausage and peperoni pizza. We had cheesie bread as a side. I was so stuffed by the end I couldn't make room for cheesie bread.

I suppose the one down side would be how long it takes. We had to wait an extra 20 minutes for the sicilian deep dish pizza. But it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! The owner is very nice and try's his best to please everyone! The place is very clean and the food is great and freshly made! I recommend this to everyone! Make sure to tell all your friends to visit here!!! When it's busy you will obviously wait a little bit more but it's worth the wait! It's delicious! I have never gotten an old pizza and I go there at least once every week or two! LOVE IT!! Keep it going guys!"}
