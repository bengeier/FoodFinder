{"text":"What a great gem! I recently had a smoked salmon, poached egg breakfast that was out of this world. The flavors were perfectly balanced and the portions were just right. The price was what I expected and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For breakfast, lunch, or dessert, Madison Sourdough can fulfill all of your pastry/bread/baked good needs.  I've been there once or twice to grab a pastry or bread to go, but honestly, my favorite thing to do is grab some delicious grub on Willy Street and then head on over to the Patisserie for dessert. Macarons, gateaux, tarts, but the thing that gets me just about every time... the religieuse. Iced choux pastry shells filled with cr√®me anglaise. Flavors vary, which is nice. Pistachio and raspberry are particularly memorable. I have always found the staff to be friendly, full of knowledge, and willing to give recommendations.   Enjoy a decadent dessert with some strong French press coffee and a cute date who lets you share their pastry. It's the perfect end to an evening dining out."}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery and breakfast place. Everything is fresh and locally sourced. I wish they would open a location on the west side of Madison."}
{"text":"Food is great. And consistently reliable. Never had a bad meal there. The bread is great too. Excellent option for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding lunch here. I had been given a recommendation from my friends at Macha tea company to check the place out. First the staff were super friendly and helpful. I sort of ordered a custom sandwich getting a peanut butter sandwich from the kids menu, I also got some bakery to go. Just as the service was super so to was the sandwich. It was also a nice treat to get such fresh and tasty fruit with the  sandwich. In my humble opinion the place is great and I look forward to returning. I was very grateful for the recommendation, they sure steered me in the right direction. Thanks MSC for a great, friendly and enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"I live in a Chicago suburb and will drive to Madison about twice a month just for this place. The eggs Benedict is to die for. Their salad is delicious. Their bread.... Drool. I can't rave enough. Make sure you take a loaf of country sandwich bread home!!"}
{"text":"EDIT: After leaving this review, a co-owner reached out to me to thank me for the review and said they are actively working to improve their service. This makes me happy.   After having been here multiple times, I find that while the food is almost always delicious, the service is lacking. I don't blame the servers, too much. It's the management, I'm guessing. All too often my simple coffee and Danish order takes several minutes. I just waited around 10 minutes for a mocha while people in line behind me got their drinks almost immediately. What's the deal? The staff tells me they are short-staffed today. I believe them. So management, do a better job of staffing the appropriate amount of people."}
{"text":"Wish they would learn how to brew coffee...they switched roasters and it still sucks. Bakery and pastries great...food trying to emulate good food, but without skill to pull it off."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in California and being able to eat sourdough bread from San Francisco with a hot cup of clam chowder was such a treat.  It never occurred to me that when I moved to Madison that would all go away...  But that all changed when I stepped into Madison Sourdough.  Definitely the best sourdough bread I have had since moving away from CA.    In addition to their amazing loaves of bread, the food that they make here is so delicious! The Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon is what I usually get, but I don't think you could go wrong with any selection that you make.    They have a large space with a lot of seating, but at times it can get a little loud when the place is packed.  You'll be too consumed with stuffing your face to really care."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is really good. Cold brew in a beer glass. Top 3 breakfast place in Madison."}
{"text":"This was one of my stops on an impromptu visit to Wisconsin. Did some research on Yelp to find a good place to grab a bite to eat before my husband and I hit the road.   We were not disappointed. When you walk in you eyes are assaulted by the wonderful bread display. The size of the shop is a bit small, but they do have a back room which is really cute. The backroom is set up with antique tables and chairs giving it a modern yet country shabby chic look. You can also view the staff whipping up your meals.  I had the buttermilk pumpkin pancakes which were a little thick and sopped up all my syrup. They did have a spiciness to them that made it unique. My husband ordered the quiche which was absolutely delicious. He raved about it from the consistency to the crust. He loved the place so much so that we pondered ordering some sandwiches for lunch to go. Ah, but there is next time if we ever happened to stop by. We would know where to go for a solid meal."}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough has some of the best bread and pastries in Madison and is worth a visit on that basis alone. As a cafe, however, it is consistently lackluster, especially given the price. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and nothing is exceptional. I would rather go to the Butcher shop across the street and get a sandwich."}
{"text":"We went there this Saturday morning for breakfast, and it was amazing. Maybe part of it was a contrast to our horrible dinner from last night, but I don't think so.   The food was better than my husband expected. I had been there before and gotten the roast beef sandwich, which was really good. I loved that its horseradish sauce was a little thin and went into the beef instead of just being a layer on top. They also shred the parmesan. Honestly, I could leave the salad greens... nothing special there... but I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich.  This morning, I got the french toast, which was excellent. A couple of weeks ago, I made french toast at home with their wheat hearth bread, and it was really good. Quite honestly, I didn't think that theirs would be able to top what I made at home (not to be too conceded or anything- ha!), but it was perfect.   As for my husband, he got the Baker's Breakfast with bacon instead of ham. The eggs were cooked perfectly and my husband described the bacon as almost rib-like in flavor-- smokey and meaty. Of course, the bread was good, too.  We bought a loaf of bread to take with us since I haven't stopped thinking about the last loaf we bought. I made the mistake of buying sourdough elsewhere since my last stop in at MSD; it did not come near the texture or flavor of theirs and was about the same price.  Ok, I think I've sung their praises enough. If you're looking for a great breakfast place that's not super crowded on Saturday morning, definitely come here. Friendly people and great food."}
{"text":"Came into Madison Sourdough this morning to get out of the office for a while and focus on a few tasks. It was great! The cashier and all the people who worked there were extremely friendly, without being overbearing. I tried the Croque Madame. It was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in Madison!  The only reason I can't give them five stars is that their Sourdough really doesn't hold a candle to anything in San Francisco. But that's not their fault, literally; we don't have the same \"bugs in the air\" in Madison as in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough is one of my favorite places to start the day in Madison. The simplest of foods shine here: a simple slice of toasted multi grain bread with a side of peanut butter was one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had in the past year. Two eggs ordered sunny side up were prepared to a level of perfection I've never seen in restaurant or home kitchens. Soy milk comes at no up charge and is offered in pitchers alongside 2 percent and whole milk options, which means Madison Sourdough earns a spot on a select list of Madison establishments that don't charge extra for plant-based preferences.   (Side note: I understand the economics of stocking soy milk v. dairy might make it financially advantageous to charge more for soy milk, but I consciously bring my repeat business to establishments that choose otherwise.)  The ambiance underscores the simple-but-excellent ethos with cement floors, wooden tables, and huge windows to let in natural light. Again, when starting my day, light, clean, and simple is is what I want.  My friends like coming here for the quiches, salads, and pastries, and I'm happy to join them for a breakfast composed of my simpler fare. With my bike benefit sticker, we save 10% on our order. MSco feels like winning so many times over that I stopped counting the wins.   Note: It is quite busy here on the weekends around brunch time. Any good breakfast place should be, though, or it won't stay open for long."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place for lunch.   Service - Average  Employees are friendly and competent, doing their jobs in a way that is expected.   Food - A waste of money. I wish I could get a refund.  The bread was hard, chewy, and tasted woody...like it would have been a tender crusty bread four days ago that was then left uncovered in the sun...  (They keep their bread loaves uncovered, on a shelf, by giant windows where the sunlight beats down unhindered...I guess that should have been a warning sign.)  The dill spread could easily have come in a budget tub from a grocer.  The red onion slice was okay, though it's really hard to screw up raw onion. Sadly, you don't gain points for slicing an onion.  The paper thin slices of cucumber were pointless, their flavor overwhelmed by the salmon & spread, and cut too thin to be crunchy.  The small pieces of salmon were okay, though nothing exceptional. You can get similar fare from your local butcher.  The side salad... ... ... wtf did they put on these greens? It tasted like bitter vinegary dish water.   Portion size - Small  It's acceptable as a very light lunch.   Over all, the salad sucked, the bread blew and the rest left me unimpressed. If I'm paying $8.50 for a small open-faced (and therefore basically only a half) sandwich, it needs to be organic, local and mind blowing amazing.   Atmosphere - Corporate / Faux - Indie  Random second hand tables, though most had their own set of matching chairs.  Sunlight from the large windows lights the place up, but be aware of where you sit to avoid excessive sun glare.   Just a side note. Their website claims their chef  \"draws inspiration from local, sustainable, and seasonal ingredients.\" This is not the same as actually *using* local, sustainable and seasonal ingredients. I dislike it when restaurants use B.S. marketing manipulation. Only their bread and beverages include local ingredients, and not even 100% like they imply."}
{"text":"After I was invited here for a meeting a couple of weeks ago I can't stay away. I have chosen Madison Sourdough for brunch the past two weekends, and I will bring out-of-town friends here this upcoming weekend as well.   Chocolate mint tea is amazing! I've tried the Eggs Diablo and Eggs Benedict. Friends have tried the grilled veggie omelet, baker's breakfast, potato hash, and salmon omelet. Everyone raved about the food.  I saved the best for last: THE PASTRIES! Chocolate croissants, scones, bread of all kinds to die for."}
{"text":"Some of the best bread I've had anywhere in the country is here. Everything they make is terrific, but the miche is truly extraordinary. Incredible pastries too--I never cared much about croissants until I ate their almond croissant. Friendly staff and pretty good lunch items too. But the most important thing is the BREAD, which has ruined me from buying bread anywhere else in the state!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is very good-- but the prices are not justified, in my opinion. I had their version of an eggs benedict... it comes over a piece of their very fresh (but very difficult to cut!) sourdough bread. The hollandaise was delicious, and the eggs were perfectly poached. It was good, but not $10 good.  Service is pretty friendly and fast-- bear in mind my experience was on a weekday at 7:30. There were newspapers lying around to peruse for free, as well as a couple magazines.  They are located next to their (sister?) Patisserie, Mco, so you can swing by there and grab some pastries or sweets if you like."}
{"text":"I pretty much just come here to grab coffee and the occasional ciabatta roll. They make a good mocha but they started making their own chai blend that does not taste good at all! I don't know if they've fixed that but I don't want to pay $4 to find out!  Their bread is pretty good, and their baristas are very nice even when I come in close to closing time."}
{"text":"It's rare to find bread this good, and I don't believe there is a better bread bakery in the Midwest. Only out on the west coast is there a level of bread baking that matches what they do at MSCo, which has only been elevated by their patisserie, with the best macarons in Madison, and a plethora of other fresh-baked goods. They are very particular about almost every aspect of operation, including their pretty good coffee, their respectable selection of tea, and their diverse brunch menu. I really think it's the best Madison has to offer, and they set the bar high.  A mandatory stop every time I return to Madison and every time I want to bring a gift to family and friends when I leave town."}
{"text":"The food is usually quite good. The soups have regularly tasted under seasoned. The grilled cheese is flipping awesome. The bakery is always a pleasure."}
{"text":"I love this local bakery and cute cafe!  I have been a big fan of Madison Sourdough's bread and pastries for some time now. They say bread is best the day it is baked and we have no trouble finishing a loaf of their sourdough the same day we buy it. I am thrilled with their new location and cafe menu. They really did wonders with the space. The appearance of the cafe is simple but well-designed and inviting.  There are many tables and free wi-fi. It is a great place to meet a friend for breakfast, take a coffee break, get some work done or grab a solo lunch. Most recently I enjoyed the warm goat cheese, apple smoked bacon, and fig marmalade on five grain sourdough sandwich - creamy, crunchy, fruity goodness! To address the previous reviewer's complaint, maybe the prices are a dollar more than one would pay elsewhere (like a national chain store) but they are local guys who are using local products to make delicious food and I am not going to complain about that. I recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough is our new favorite weekend breakfast/brunch spot. Haven't had a bad meal here. The veggie burger is phenomenal, the soup is heartwarming, and when you're not sure what else to get the egg croissant is a safe bet (richness not withstanding). Staff is encouraging and atmosphere is Madisonish."}
{"text":"On a rare sunshine-y Winter day, I took a seat in a sunbeam at the counter of Madison Sourdough.  The store was filled with community spirit.  A dad and his little boy sat next to me while he got his son a cookie for breakfast.  What a dad!  People of many generations were meeting up for breakfast and coffee.  There is a nearby parking lot, but this spot sees plenty of foot and bicycle traffic.    I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with the sausage on the side in case it was too greasy or I didn't like it.  The server was friendly and non-intrusive, keeping my water full and quickly delivering my espresso drink.  I was checking out the store copy of the morning's paper and he gave me the okay to do my best with the crossword.  I had walked there, myself, and soon thawed out from the cold and windy trip.  It was the morning after an icy shower and many businesses had been difficult to walk in front of, but these folks had their walk nice and cleared of ice and snow, which I really appreciate when you are working the early shift and have to take care of that.  The sandwich was perfect, sausage flavorful and not the least bit greasy and the fresh fruit side was very welcome (especially since they didn't use out-of-season melons and such, but nice Winter storage pears and apples instead).    I didn't get bread to take home that day, but I have had their bread and it is wonderfully well made, as are their danish and brioche.  Please go check out the Madison Sourdough company.  I couldn't recommend it more!  It is a community supporting, warm, and social place, and leaves a great memory of sunshine and friendliness and a cold Winter day.   I couldn't finish my crossword and left it for the next lucky patron."}
{"text":"I've eaten here enough to know you can't go wrong here for breakfast items. Everything is pretty great--provided you like everything to taste fresh and local. Like the Lazy Jane's and the Weary Traveler, I think this place defines the Willy Street Cuisine. My \"go-to\" meals are the French Toast and the Breakfast Sandwich on a Croissant."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Definitely sit outside on the patio if you can and get a half loaf of bread to nibble on while you wait for your food (if you have the self-control to limit yourself to just a few nibbles). I got the Pepitas Polenta load and WOW so good. You'll just have to get it to try for yourself. I love hearty breads where you can see how wholesome it is and this bread was exactly that. I got the eggs diablo which is their version of shakshuka and it was incredible (insider tip: it also tastes incredible with the Pepitas Polenta bread) My friend got the eggs benny which looked incredible I need to get next time- it was a huge serving (which is saying a lot for an eggs benny dish) that was placed on a massive hunk of their sourdough bread. If you're ever on Willy St I highly recommend stopping by and picking up a loaf of bread cause  everything tastes better on real, delicious, freshly-baked bread."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  I love this place.  Obviously it's a cafe/bakery, so the coffee and baked goods are phenomenal.  But a lot of people don't realize that their FOOD menu is also to die for.  Breakfast or lunch - I have always had a good meal.  Great salad greens on the side with a refreshing vinaigrette.  In the winter, I always get a huge bowl of their hearty soup with fresh bread on the side.  There isn't anything better.  For some reason, every time I have the soup, I swear it's the best soup I've ever had.  It happens again and again.   Also, I've done some work on my computer there during less busy hours - great place to grab some coffee and get stuff done.   5+ stars."}
{"text":"First and foremost,  let me say that I LOVE the food here. I truly and honestly do. Their food is light, delicious, and match what I enjoy to the T. But their inconsistency is killing them.   I usually order the panzanella salad. It's my favorite salad here in Madison. But I've ordered this salad once in store and they forgot the gorgonzola. That's fine since I was dining in. I've ordered this salad for takeout about four other times and they forgot the gorgonzola on two different occasions. When I order it to go, half the time they'll put the dressing on the side. And the other half, the dressing will come tossed in. Salads to go should never have the dressing tossed in unless you like really soggy veggies.   If I'm not getting the panzenella salad, I'll order the eggs benedict with ham. Not a big fan of the salmon because it usually comes out partially cooked. Not a vibrant orange like most smoked salmon but a pinkish orange / fully cooked salmon. (They advertise smoked salmon) There have been instances where I'll order this for takeout and they would forget the poached eggs... an eggs benedict without the eggs. Yum.   I will say this again, I love the food here. I really do. I'll keep ordering food here but I really just wish they were a little more consistent with what they do here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just missed the andouille sausage sandwich but I'm guessing that I was the only one who ordered it.   The staff is great, always willing to chat.   I particularly love that the sandwiches come with a side salad instead of fries.  Also the bread is great."}
{"text":"This morning I and a friend stopped by there for our breakfast. It's a perfect day to sit outside.  The place is just lovely and there were many selection for bread and pastry. They looked good but I haven't try any one of them yet, maybe next time.  For breakfast I had french toast no.10. It was served beautifully, well presented but personally I don't like the pieces of bread. They were not soft enough. However it was not too sweet and sour pieced of peeled green apple were on the top of whip cream. I liked it a lot. I would give 5 if the bread was right. Moreover my black coffee was good, medium roasted I guess."}
{"text":"I can give this spot 4 stars because I tried quite a few things on the menu all in one go.  This is a great low key spot with fresh made breads, soups, salads and pastries.  My colleague suggested this place for a take out lunch, so we ventured over. The interior has this semi-rustic, semi-shabby-chic feel with mounted chalkboard menus, Ball glass jars for hot drinks and homemade jams, wooden tables and chairs and decided antique iron accent pieces throughout the place.  I scanned the menu for the veggie/pescatarian options and came across a few things that sound appetizing.  Because it's turning cold here in Madison, it was between the grilled cheese with tomato pesto and spinach, the tuna melt with capers, and the house veggie burger with tomato pesto, spinach and fontina cheese.  I went for the burger on the half and half special with a potato leek soup; it comes with a spinach and romaine side salad.  The burger had great flavor and texture, with a balance of ingredients. One thing that does veggie burger in for me is the overuse of an ingredient in an attempt to keep the patty form, like black beans or beets. This one was nice, and the pesto and cheese set it off.  The potato leek soup was a bit more liquid than I'm used too, but again, the flavor was solid without being overwhelming.  I also ordered a morning bun, which is apparently a popular breakfast pastry.  It's a puffed croissant with cinnamon sugar dusting all over. Goodness. it's good. Butter is your friend. I can see this with a good hot cocoa!  I also tried their iced pomegranate green tea, unsweetened.  Also very nice and refreshing.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful with menu options.  It was clean, and though there was a bit of a wait for the food we ordered to go, it wasn't overcrowded for the lunch hour.  I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food but man, the service is bad!  The people couldn't be nicer but they are s-l-o-w and get things mixed up - every time!  My co-worker had the wrong food brought to him 3 times, and today our simple order for three had two big old errors.  The bread, on the other hand, is outstanding.  Great crisp crusts, interesting flavors, and the sweets are perfectly tempting and yummy.  Every soup I have had has been interesting, hearty and well made.  Please get your act together, guys.  We want you to succeed on Willy Street.  At high artisanal prices, your service has  to match the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I've been here often and I've had a range of anywhere from 2 star to 4 star meals. Salads are usually good, although you should ask for your dressing on the side. Some of the breakfasts are disappointing -- eggs diablo had little savor, strata just not very interesting. Vegetarian options can be limited at times. I would consider returning for the salad or occasional specials, but the coffee is really bad. It purports to be a premium blend, but I've found the medium blend to be almost undrinkable, tasting like a weak hazelnut flavored brew."}
{"text":"The best service I've received in a long time. They were excellent, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. The menu has a great variety, and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've tried the berry French toast and the egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant. Both are delicious and I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple: outstanding breads and croissants!  I make a detour to stop by this bakery whenever in town and always end up with a loaf of bread and a few pastries to take home. I have no plan to stop that habit."}
{"text":"The worst French Toast ever; unless you like it black and tough. It als doesn't come with syrup; you have to ask... The staff here likes to communication in barely audible murmurs and will not look you in the eye. Want to know why? Because they are hiding their shame of producing horrible breakfast foods!   This place must only do ok because of the hipster population that cares only for appearances and eco friendly take out boxes. This place will impress no one else."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! The food is top notch every time I visit. Their staff rocks. And the atmosphere excellent. I could sit around all day and be quite happy eating and drinking the deliciousness they have to offer."}
{"text":"Update: they've changed recipe... The bread and the mixed greens are both a little pedestrian now.  While it's still very good, it's no longer the life changing experience once was.  The eggs Benedict here is by far my favorite meal in Madison.  It's better than the bibimbop at graze, better than the pizza at grandpa's, it's even better than the rhubarb crepe at Bradbury's.  And they somehow manage to make it taste healthy (for restaurant food).  The pastries are pretty top notch too, definitely recommend the peach danish."}
{"text":"I ordered the Baker's breakfast which included an over easy egg, ham and bread.  The best part of my meal was the bread and European butter.  My friend ordered the French toast with berries and cream.  I admittedly chose wrong because after sampling hers, I was jealous.  A great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Awesome food and coffee and pastries. The knock on the a service is just insane - unkind and unfair. Their service is always great. The atmosphere is warm with lots of wood huge front windows.  MSC is a real Willy Street gem, the kind of thing you can only find in this part of town."}
{"text":"One of the best Reuben sandwiches I've ever had. The rye sourdough bread it came on was freakin delish. Just noticed their breakfast menu and how delicious it looks. Have to come back to try it out. Great coffee. Friendly staff. Three thumbs up."}
{"text":"I cannot stay away from Madison Sourdough. No matter what the season, when we visit Madison, we visit MS to eat in and bring back to Chicago the goodness of their breads and pastries. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, we had the amazing Parker Rolls. From this weekend, I have brought back more bread and am going to be trying the cinnamon roll and Normandy apple tart. Honestly, I don't care if any of it is already a day or two old. I'm sure it will be delicious. And I am already missing our lovely, chilly February morning breakfast there of croissant, fruit and cream of mushroom soup. Do we have to move to Madison or is there any way they could open in Chicago? Or better yet- in my kitchen??? See you soon, MS."}
{"text":"We were rushed this weekend and just wanted to go some place close (we were visiting from Chicago and our hotel was nearby).  I have never been to this cafe before, and my expectations were low.   Boy, was I wrong.  One of their breakfast specials was a salad with quinoa & cashews that was outstanding.  My husband and son had pastries, bread, eggs, etc. and were likewise very happy.  In fact, they munched on the bread we purchased during the drive home to Chicago.  Its a self-serve place, but the woman who took our orders was fantastic--made sure we understood all that they offered & was accommodating regarding all our specifics.  Bottom line,it was perfect, and I hate eating breakfast out because its always the same thing...eggs, bread, etc. etc.  The salad was just perfect!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I cannot praise this little gem enough. Service was friendly and helpful,  food was clearly prepared with skill and care. The potato hash did not disappoint - the flavors were harmonious yet each distinct - perfectly balanced. My wife had the broccoli quiche and was kind enough to let me try a bite (but just one) and I can safely say this was the best quiche I have ever tasted. The custard was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth, the crust tender and flaky, and the seasoning just perfection. We ordered the London Fog each as our beverage on the recommendation of other yelpers and were grateful we did! We'll be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"First time here while in town.  Super friendly staff, but I am rethinking the price for breakfast.  I ordered the breakfast \"special\".  Egg sandwich on a croissant.  Basically a baby omelet with melted cheese inside. A light spread of some aioli.  On fluffy (and good) croissant.  I Added bacon, which I guess was the financial culprit.  One cup of Java, and one large OJ.  Price?  $19.00  It was a fine sandwich, but not worth basically twenty bucks.  Was I at Yankee Stadium?"}
{"text":"I ordered the daily special, a portabella, ham, and Gruyere quiche served with aioli and a side salad. I also tried a cup of the vegan black bean soup. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich with chutney.   The melted Gruyere was perfectly crusted over the egg, and the crust was flaky and crispy! The aioli didn't contribute much to the dish and was lackluster. I was expecting black bean to be pur√©ed, but the simplicity complemented the rich quiche flavors.   My friend reports that the pork sandwich was juicy and the chutney tangy, but overall lacked flavor.   For dessert, we had the raspberry Danish (in picture). It was moist, flaky, and a good portion size. We enjoyed the balance between the fresh, tart raspberries and the sweet cheese. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My first visit and it won't be my last.  Had the Ham, Swiss and Red Pepper Quiche and  an Almond Croissant.  The food is an easy 10 out of 10 and the coffee is the best I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm really beginning to like Madison Sourdough. I've only had the breakfast here so far, but both the fritatta and the braised pork belly over polenta were delicious. The orange juice isn't too bad either.   Sourdough also serves kambucha."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just discovered this place. We were here on a warm winter weekend and it was packed. The line moves quickly and the staff is on the ball and organized.   My one complaint - the thing I picked to order was out, but there was no indication until we were at the register and then I had to choose something new very quickly lest I hold up the long line of folks behind me. A little \"sold out\" sticker on the menu board would go a long way.   In the end, our food was absolutely delicious. There's plenty of standard fare, but also all kinds of interesting takes. Left pleasantly full with a loaf of bread for lunches and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! Today, was my third visit to Madison Sourdough. I am so impressed with their food everytime I come here to dine.  I had the roasted beet Reuben today. Don't be fooled, it's comparable to a meat sandwich. Trying to eat healthier for the new year, so I felt a little less guilt filling up on these veggies :).  My boyfriend had a bloody Mary. He liked it, he can tell it's fresh/homemade and not like other bloody Mary's. However, he would never come here for just that. He also had the grilled chicken sandwich, which is out of this world. I had a few bites myself. It was sweet and savory with apples and bacon on it! My belief is that Madison Sourdough is one of the best breakfast/lunch places in Madison, hands down. There is no direct parking outside, but the street parking in this neighborhood is much easier than navigating further downtown."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their eggs benedict is so light and irresistible. I always go to Madison Sourdough thinking I'm going to try something new... but I always end up getting the salmon benedict. It is not like any benedict you will have at other restaurants.I have tried some other items on the menu from friends and they have all been good as well. I also like that they have an extra section towards the inside of the cafe that's quiet and cozy. I like that I have the option to sit towards the front door where it's more bustling or sit towards the inside where it's quieter. During the summer they have seating outside as well and it's nice there too."}
{"text":"It was said that I didn't describe the wonderful breakfast sandwich from MSD and thus they failed to make the list. NOOOO the injustice!!! MSD definitely has the best breakfast sandwich in town!!!!  Where can you get fried croissant with melted cheese and house made ham or bacon??? And the croissant is FRIED so it's not soggy like some other places I've been to. And they used to do the scrambled eggs runny till some people were too bothered by the rawness of the egg. Just ask and customize your egg!!  Ok, my other new favorite is the biscuits and gravy!! Mmmmmmmm so good. It comes with an egg on top. The biscuit withstands the flood of delicious gravy filled with meat. Ohhhhhhhhhh so good. One of my favorites in town!   Also, don't forget their ice coffee, it is really cold brewed. Not like some other places which just dunk ice into hot coffee -.- it is NOT the same.  Oops, I forgot, they had some amazing baking classes. I did the cake decorating and gingerbread house one. The gingerbread house was such a great and worth it experience. Only $35 for 4 people, we had 4 adult females. We got to bring home one decorated house and were amply fed with endless cookies, sandwiches, hot cider. It was AMAZING.   So yeah, one of my favorite breakfast places in town! And now they sell alcohol too!!"}
{"text":"Never knew what this place was but assumed a bakery until I actually came in. Big selection of  brunch plates plus pastries, so something for all kinds of appetite sizes. I came in and had a meal-sized salad. It was so huge I had to box half of it home!!! (I think it was a Cobb)   Unlike a lot of places that serve this fare, there is ample seating. Think of it is as a better pret a manger/au bon pain. My friend Annie just had a baby when we met up for lunch here, and the baby plus baby scooter (or whatever you call it) fit very comfortably."}
{"text":"Get the eggs diablo.  Get the breakfast sandwich.  Get the cinnamon roll.  Hell... who am I kidding?  Get any damn thing off the menu and you won't be disappointed.  I have yet to be disappointed in any of my selections, even the coffee rocks.  Bonus:  my friends live around the corner but don't tell them that's the reason why I drop in to visit so often.  They think it's because they have stellar personalities."}
{"text":"I really like the pastries and bakery, especially when it is out fresh in the morning.   I picked up a couple of chocolate croissants and other baked good at 6 am once after I dropped off my friend at the airport. The bakery was AWESOME! The crispy yet non-greasy taste had left me wanting to go back for more.  I have tried other bakery shops and I think the quality and taste is on par with shops like Batch.   Price-wise, it's on par with other bakery shops.  I also had a braised pork sandwich which was A-OK. I thought the serving portion was small. Although the food was prepared fresh and there is some aesthetics in plating, the meal was forgetting and I would not re-order.  Overall, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Brunch. Potato hash made with duck fat. You'd have to be a quack not to eat this dish. Easy over egg, kale and farro. Great combo of textures and flavors.  My guy had the veggie burger and tomato bisque. The patty was incredibly flavorful as it incorporated a balsamic gastrique. The soup was creamy and the perfect accompaniment.  Kickapoo coffee. How can one go wrong?"}
{"text":"I don't know about bread but meals here are not good. I just spent whole 10 minutes waiting for a very basic breakfast sandwhich which came out to a whopping more than $10 and was dripping with grease.  Had few sit-down meals there and they also ranged from mediocre to simply unedible. Sourdough also loves giving you \"salad\" on the side which is wilted salad greens literally swimming in some nasty creamy dressing. If this salad is next to the sandwich, bread on that sandwich will quickly soak in that dressing and get mushy as well.  This last breakfast experience prompted me to write this review because I gave the place many chances to redeem itself."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great. I can't believe it took us a few years to try it. We arrived around 9 on a Sunday morning and there were several available tables. I got the biscuit & gravy and my wife got the French toast. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped for Saturday breakfast with family. Great as always! Breakfast sandwich and biscuits with gravy as still my favs. Not a bad thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"You can get a great breakfast here, but if you want to enjoy a quiet breakfast don't sit in the back area.  We were there for breakfast Saturday morning, but the front room tables were all occupied, so we had to sit in the back area. If you enjoy having your breakfast in a \"daycare\" environment, then you are seated in the right area.  I would strongly recommend taking out the play toys and children books, as it becomes a free for all, with some parents not exercising control of their children. As a side note, they make the best bread in Madison!"}
{"text":"This rave is going to be anything but SOUR. Unless we are talking in reference to delicious sourdough bread. Then it's of the highest quality!  I keep waiting to have a less than stellar food or service experience with MSCO. It never happens! As far as food and beverages, MSCO \"rises\" to the occaission. Breads, pastisserie, coffee (used to be Kickapoo, now JBC), breakfast foods, grab-and-go sandwiches, pop-up pizzas, it's all DELICIOUS! MSCO, to me, is unique in the way they combine the simplicity of local, small-farm ingredients and turn out a range of simple to complex flavors and dishes. Honorable food item mention goes to the biscuits and gravy, topped with poached eggs, of course!  Service has always, always been with a smile. This has not dimmed over the years with staff turnover. MSCO always finds perpetually pleasant staff. Thank you all for always being so kind, attentive, and upbeat!   The only mild issue I have is when fellow patrons bring in their whiny or loud kiddos. The volume easily echoes and creates a less than ideal experience. I don't want a side of sassy youngsters with my biscuits. No thank you. But maybe that's your jam.   There are three different indoor spaces to sit, along with the outdoor sections in the spring/summer/early fall. Take advantage of the outdoor seating if you can! A calm, crisp cup of coffee or tea while hogging an entire table and two chairs (to kick up your feet, of course!) is divine!"}
{"text":"Despite much of the criticism below, I found Madison Sourdough to be an absolutely wonderful gastronomic experience! If you're searching for something rich and savory, perhaps a good breakfast fix, Madison Sourdough is your place! My dad and I were merely passing through when we stumbled upon it and I had absolutely ZERO REGRETS about ordering the fantastic Croque-monsieur; a delectable open face sandwich piled high with smooth, warm ham and topped with a rich, incredibly cheesy Gruy√®re sauce dressed liberally all over.  Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. A must try when visiting the great city of Madison!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Friday afternoon. Took my 2yo with me and it was a great time! I'm going to review the atmosphere cause I just have a few kind things to say, and the dive into what's really important: carbs. For anyone with a kid I think it's either a hit or a miss depending on the day. This day was a total hit! We got there around 11:30 and ordered two things off the kids menu: the eggs and the French toast. As we sat waiting for our food in the back portion of the restaurant I was surprised to see that they have a small toy selection for kiddos! We brought some dinos over to our table and were occupied for the entire meal. The meal. Scrambled eggs: perfect. French toast: superb. So sweet and smothered in syrup (my own choice, it's pour your own) while remaining crispy.  I love sourdough. I can't believe it took me so long to try this place."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Everything has been consistently excellent.  The ingredients and flavors are amazingly blended.  The espresso drinks are as good as I've had at most coffee shops.  I have tried many of the pastries and desserts and I have been delighted beyond expectation.  The breakfasts and lunches are unique, but not over the top.  All the ingredients always taste fresh and well balanced.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for an early breakfast on a Sunday and was not disappointed! Arrived around 8:30 and I was glad we did because by 9 the line for the register pretty long. There was plenty of seating though, even when they got busy and they have a few tables for larger parties as well! I ordered the cheddar chive breakfast sandwich with ham and a gruyere croissant for later. My friend ordered the potato hash and a cheddar chive biscuit. Both of our meals were delicious! The hash offered my friend the hearty morning vegetables and starch she wanted after a long afternoon of drinking the day before, I tried it as well and the veggies were seasoned perfectly. My breakfast was perfectly balanced, sweet from some kind of jam and spicy from jalape√±o cream cheese with that runny egg yolk adding richness to every bite. Next time I would skip the ham, it really didn't add much more than some extra protein. Greens are included on the side of the sandwich and the dressing was zesty and delicious. I ate every bite on my plate!  I got home a few hours later and ate that gruyere croissant for lunch. I have no words, simply delicious. I'm looking forward to returning to grab some of their bread!"}
{"text":"Ordered a coffee for $2.50 and the \"Chicken Breast\" \"Side\" for $4.50   The Chicken breast was high quality, but the size was upsetting - about 1 or 1.5 oz. of chicken strips, maybe one fourth of a small breast. It was essentially an order of sashimi, but made from chicken, the cheapest popular lean animal protein, not an exotic aquatic delicacy. My friends laughed. I went, \"Oh well, not buying food here any more.\"  The sweet and creamy stuff looked tasty and reasonably priced, if thats your thing. The open window in the kitchen was pretty darn fun to peek through too! My culinary experience, however, left a lot to be desired. I felt frustrated and a bit ripped off."}
{"text":"One of the freshest and most memorable eggs benedict I have had. And I order it almost every place we travel it's one of my favorites. Husband like his omelet, but wasn't amazed and was still hungry afterwards. We topped them off splitting a couple croissants which were both delicious. Was excited to try a Savory one which I don't get often at home. Planning to go back to grab more pastries before heading home."}
{"text":"The search was on to find a new place to try out brunch. Though I've drove past Madison Sourdough a handful of time, and always said..\"I want to try that place out\" as I say about a lot of places being a new Madison resident. Today was the day we were going to try it out!  I can imagine the front patio being a perfect place to sit at in the summer, the tables and chairs were still up, but we decided on sitting inside on the mildly chilly Sunday afternoon.   Walked in and there was some good music playing through out the cafe, walked up to the counter to grab a menu and gaze at the amazing looking pastries and breads behind the glass counter. Once we decided on what we were ordering we sat down with our table number. The wait for three entrees was about 10 Minutes not too terribly bad at all.   I ended up getting The Grilled Cheese as my other party goers opted for breakfast foods.  The Sandwich came with a Tomato Bisque, and a House Side Salad. The sandwich itself...fantastic! It came on a seed and grain sourdough, with Fontina Cheese, and Dijon. Though a pretty small grilled cheese, it was so filling. After finishing my tomato bisque dipped grilled cheese, I was pleased and could barely finish the salad or the soup.   Can't wait to try it out again, next time for breakfast or even just to grab a coffee and laptop in hand!"}
{"text":"I've never actually been in the store but I tend to buy a loaf of bread from Madison Sourdough Co from their off-to-the-side stand at the farmer's market every single week that I am able. I don't exaggerate in saying that they make some of the best artisan bread that I have ever had.  The girl at the stand claims that the bread is made using nothing but flour, salt and water. What a load of crap. You don't make bread that good with just 3 ingredients...do you?"}
{"text":"9/20/13 My wife and I stopped in for a late breakfast.  Why haven't we done this before now?!?  The in-house smoked ham, the bread, the Kickapoo Coffee...  I could go on and on...  They could improve their interior decorating, but it's really about the food.  It's good eats!"}
{"text":"I love Madison sourdough! It's one of my frequent weekend brunch place where I can sit outside and enjoy my food.  They have a wide selections of brunch and lunch items, from the classic egg benedits, to duck fat fried potatoes and a bunch of other sweet stuff. They also change up their menu every so often, with some special items during festive holidays and such.  Most of their dishes come with a slice of their sourdough, which is delicious. They also do the essential caffeinated drinks and blood maries.  I have tried their samlon egg benedits before and a tomato bisque with poached eggs and relishes dish this time. Amazing food and they do their portion quietly perfectly (to me, that's less than what portions are here in the US). Menu is reasonably priced and there is a lot of room since they have a large ish back room, the main front room and also the front yard!   They also sell pastries and baked goods everyday, which are also amazing. So stop by not only for breakfast, but also for those goodies!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area looking for a fantastic food choice, Yelp and my husband's hankering for a latte beckoned us here.  We chose to eat off the lunch side (breakfast until 3 PM too) with orders of the Pork and Apple sandwich and Chicken Pannini.  Both came with a side salad tossed with a light vinaigrette.   The sandwiches were tasty and the bread was fantastic.  The pork was on baguette and the chicken was a hearty sourdough.  My husband isn't into tough breads so it was tender and still crunchy.  I have to admit, I thought the pork was going to be acceptable but it had beautiful flavors which gave a sweet savory.  I will be back but to try the bakers breakfast or french toast."}
{"text":"Not your typical bakery...  A wide selection of items really makes it hard when you're hungry and in a hurry.  The biscuits and gravy was unreal, flakey biscuit in a bath of gravy that was not your typical greasy gravy.  Flavor and texture made this a have again item.  The locally sourced bacon was awesome.  Breads were wonderful, with the sourdough giving San Francisco a run for the money.  Another place to hit in Madison!"}
{"text":"The nut roll and bread are to die for. The first time I had the nut roll, I inhaled it and hid from the old man so I wouldn't have to share it. It's that good. Heck, I won't even share the bread with him...the sunflower sourdough is that good."}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough has some of the most expertly prepared baked goods in Madison. How can you resist one of their gorgeous loaves of bread or flaky croissants? One of my new favorite things is their currant bran muffin. The brightness of the currants pairs well with the sweet, nuttiness of the bran. The best part about it is the millet. Grains of millet are flecked throughout and there is a sweet, crunchy sugared millet on top. You get a nice crunch in every bite, followed by the creaminess of the millet. (Let me say it again. Millet.) It's an experience.  In terms of other menu items... Their biscuits and gravy is so flavorful. Salty from the ham, spicy from sausage, buttery and flaky from the biscuits. There are some nice herbs in there as well. I tend to be a health nut, but I would crave this on the daily. The quiche here is also on a whole new level. It's the creamiest. Just trust me.  So how does one resist anything here? You don't, because you'll be back. At least I will."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and everyone really enjoyed what they got. I was leery about the salad with breakfast but it was very tasty and nicely balanced out the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich I got. The food didn't take too long to come out and service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've gotten their bread consistently which is one of the best in Madison.   Their brunch lentil salad was very sad. But their French toast looked great.   Their coffee is a little too sour and acidic for my liking.   I've never had their pastries but those look amazing.   I like the setup and d√©cor. I like to watch them making bread and I'm interested in what workshops will come about.   Their service is very good. I like to go in the middle of the day on a weekday so it's not busy. Obviously that's not easy for most people but if you can do it, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"So I'm looking for the perfect coffee shop in which to work.  Take my review in that spirit.  The bread is fab, the food is excellent, the coffee so-so.  I would totally work and eat here every day if it weren't so LOUD.  The place is bright and high-ceilinged, which is generally a plus, but the staff consistently blasts whatever they're listenting to so aggressively that it seems they are trying to drive customers away.  I don't want to be a table-hog, and am more than willing to buy a meal and beverages to rent my seat and wifi, but it's generally a writer-unfriendly spot.  Even my best earbuds don't help."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to Brunch in Madison. From the aesthetic to the friendly staff and you really can't forget the scrumptious food...not just bread. Madison Sourdough has everything you're looking for a more.   I came with my friend for brunch and we were excited to see the expansion. Think rustic modern art gallery with a bar and bakery. sounds like heaven I know! But for real, here's the run down.   Eggs diablo: an ABSOLUTE MUST. Now, i'm not much of an egg girl, but I can be saucy and this place does the sauce right. Just the description, \"spicy ancho-tomato sauce\" with a \"cilantro cream.\" Um hello! just take  my money and get some extra sourdough on the side because you will not want to waste any of this deliciousness.   French toast: now this was a pleasant surprise because i'm really not a french toast person, but i am a sourdough person and if you're either of those you will enjoy this!! Gosh the mixture of the bread with the sweetness of the vanilla custard and blueberry balsamic preserves. Don't lie, your drooling right now.   Brioche bun: and last, but not least, this simple, elegant, ever scrumptious brioche bun. I walked in here starved and was immediately satisfied with this delightful brioche bun. Puffy and soft with a nice crunch, all the textures will make you go crazy, but then! They warm it for you and you're basically in heaven.   Lavender Lemonade: i got tricked because it comes out in this GORGEOUS blue opaque gradient and i swear it was the glass but as i kept drinking it, not only was the lemonade refreshing with just the perfect balance of lavender, i found that glass was clear and the drink itself was the most gorgeous color!!!  Don't say I didn't warn you, but this place is the bomb and you will most definitely be back for more.   if you want bread, go EARLY as they always sell out.   Happy Brunching! or snacking! or just plain eating!!"}
{"text":"They have a delicious chocolate croissant which is usually my go to here. Their bread loaves are pretty tasty as well with a great sourdough (of course) flavor. If you come in the afternoons they have some pastry specials at the end of their day."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the food is excellent, fresh and flavorful and the portion sizes are not blown out of proportion. I think this restaurant could just as easily be on the west side and probably do a higher volume of business, but I'm quite glad to have it right here on the east side.   Their salads are excellent and I discovered a wonderful brunch sandwich during a recent weekend morning visit. Coffee is from Kickapoo, which is some of the best around.   The bread, well, it's fresh bread from a bakery. Of course it's great. The new patisserie adjoining the restaurant has some beautiful desserts I'm excited to try soon."}
{"text":"Update: They now have an express lane on weekends for people who just want to buy a loaf of bread. LOVE this!"}
{"text":"Oh yes, this is a place after my own heart: outstanding breads, great coffee, and an interesting list of breakfast/brunch specials well executed and reasonably priced.  The vibe is relaxed, the staff friendly and helpful.  I took a small suitcase of bread back to Philly - the country baguette and fig country loaf being standouts. I always think that places like this are civic treasures where the community can come together and have an enjoyable and oh so tasty time."}
{"text":"The food at Madison Sourdough Company and Patisserie is amazing overall. There are a few execution errors but as someone in the baking industry, that is pretty normal. The biggest execution error I saw the last time I was there was their mini basque cakes. A basque cake is a traditional Spanish dessert where it is a white rich cake filled with custard that is baked inside of it. It is decadent and brilliant. This basque cake, however, was really burnt and hard and the custard was over cooked due to the entire cake being over cooked. Otherwise the food is wonderful and I love their bread and especially their French macaroons.  The service is why they get a 3. I feel like when I go in, I am often times inconveniencing them. Being someone who has worked at most levels of the service industry, this really isn't acceptable. I am a very understanding customer because I've been behind the counter and behind the kitchen door. I understand that shit happens. But when you outright, blatantly act like a person coming in off the street who hasn't shown any malice towards you and has been nothing but warm is the problem? That's not ok."}
{"text":"This place is like the worst nightmare of anyone who is allergic to gluten. There is gluten virtually floating in the air, in the form of tiny little sourdough spores that smell so good you'll wish you could taste them. Luckily, I am not allergic to gluten.  Today I took a group of 7 to MSCo and every single one of us was impressed. I had the special which was a pork belly sandwich on fresh brioche with braised red cabbage, a horseradish aoli, and homemade sweet pickles. It was divine. I also really enjoyed the side salad with apple cider vinaigrette.  I tried a sample of the seeded rye bread in line and was extremely impressed. Also worth mentioning was the chocolate gateau basque with sea salt caramel. I think I cried a little when I ate it; it was beautiful.  I took a scone home and while the flavor was good (raspberry hazelnut), it seemed over-baked to me (dark on the outside and beyond-normal-scone dryness on the inside).  That was the only negative thing I can say about the whole trip though. The service was great... the interior was very welcoming... Heck! I even found a parking spot really easily. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I think this is the most under rated brunch spot in Madison.  The bacon, cheese, egg croissant is delicious beyond comparison.  I'm also a big fan of the citrusy vinaigrette they put on the side salad that accompanies many dishes.  Outdoor seating is nice for when the weather is cooperating and they have ample indoor seating as well.  My only complaint would be that the coffee is way overpriced for so-so quality."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy is soooo good here. They also have a copy of the NY times paper in the morning circulating for free!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Madison for the opera and found this place first on Instagram. I've been a couple of times and love it! The coffee is great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the food is lovely."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch, grab the sides! Chicken is well peppered, salad is crispy and cold. Only reason it's not five stars is because I haven't tried any main dishes! But I do want to... to be continued..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had. I tried the #6 breakfast croissant and was in love. My whole family had excellent food. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I spent a couple of hours at Madison Sourdough and it was enjoyable from top to bottom. Corey D and I started with breakfast. I had a decaf latte and I know, I know. What's the point of coffee without caffeine? Being pregnant means I can't have too much caffeine, but I still really enjoy the smell and taste of coffee, hence the decaf version. And sometimes decaf tastes terrible, like the coffee gods are punishing you for having poor taste. But, this one was quite nice.  For food I ordered a selection of sides - a build-your-own-breakfast if you will. I had two eggs, a giant side of fruit, and a warm biscuit served with house made preserves. I enjoyed every bite.  After breakfast we spent some time working, aka Internetting, and the connection was always reliable and the atmosphere calm and friendly. I would easily recommend this spot for breakfast, a bit of work, meeting up with friends, or baked goods!"}
{"text":"This is Escape coffee's old area - and I do have to say, they've done a wonderful job of using the space. It has a very clean and modern feel. Their logo is awesome as well, but let's get back to the food.  The first thing I noticed is that it is expensive for bread. Is it just me, or is paying $4- for a white sourdough loaf (1lb) and $3.50 for a baguette a bit much? I got to try their rustic sourdough which was kind of like a mixture between whole food's Seeduction Bread and Sourdough. The sourdough baguette was okay- needs more flavor.  They also have a pastry case, coffee, and a lunch menu, which looks pretty solid. Open 6:30a-5p; if open later- I would go there for coffee."}
{"text":"We had a freakin' fantastic brunch here on a Wisconsin vacation. Kind of a hole in the wall place but huge flavors can be found here.  I got the biscuits and gravy which was stellar. The home made biscuit was out of this world. The gravy was savory and the eggs on top made it truly delectable. The wife got the Eggs Diablo which was a perfect spicy breakfast meal: spicy gazpacho, poached eggs, peppers, and a baguette to soak up all that flavor. I had and iced dirty chai that was on point and the wife had a iced coffee that she really enjoyed. When all was said and done we of course made our way the the pastries they sell next door and picked up some macaroons a chocolate and a pecan. I would just come back for these, they were that good. So as you can read, this place is worth a stop or two and don't forget the macaroons."}
{"text":"Amazing bread here - I usually end up buying Madison Sourdough loaves from the Willy St Coop. When I specifically go here, it's for brunch because their French Toast is *delicious*!"}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. My parents were in town for a weekend and we were looking for a new breakfast place, so we decided to wander down Willy St. to see what we found.   Between the three of us we got 2 salads, a sandwich, and several pastries. The salads were very generous and my sandwich was large as well. The food was very flavorful and clearly fresh ingredient were used. My sandwich was on thicker bread which made it a little difficult to eat, but I suppose that's just a personal preference and it was still delicious. I thought the prices were acceptable for the quality of the food and portion sizes.    Overall, a good experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place in all of Madison!  Each year I come here, order and sit on the beautiful patio and eat!  Fall is a great time to come and visit!  The food is greater, the area is great and it just feels like small town charm in. Bigger city!"}
{"text":"Oh my, what a great bakery!   Enjoyed the outstanding sprouted rye bread and sampled a few other breads.   Staff is exceptional with many ideas.   I came back to the dessert side of the restaurant and have to say that was some of the best ice cream I have ever had.   I wish there were more chocolate dessert options, but what I had was outstanding.   I later saw Madison Sourdough at the Dane County Farmer's Market and they were super friendly.   Great pastry, bread and ice cream delivered by a super knowledgeable staff -- don't hesitate to go!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm breakfast. Sourdough has great bread and breakfast options. It also appeared to be pretty pet friendly, with too small pooches hanging around their owners (one of which was in a stroller...but that's en entirely different story).   Anyway, I had the granola that was incredibly flavorful and paired with a nice creamy yogurt. Boyfriend had 2 thick slabs of brioche french toast with berries. It was all very good with speedy service and easy table finding on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"They make some delicious bread here! But we all knew that already. What surprised me here was the ambiance. The place is cozy! I can see coming here for a relaxed brunch very often.  I had the special of the day, strata with mushrooms, provolone and sage, and BF had the baker breakfast, both delicious! For next time I have my eyes set on the hash: looks really yummy!  I also had a good iced tea and BF had an espresso. Like me BF is Italian, which means he can be quite snobby about coffee, but BF commented the espresso was good, much better than others he had recently!   Can see this becoming a favorite!"}
{"text":"Tasty, pretty darn reliable.   Had one encounter with a girl working at the counter who was truly unpleasant and that turned me off for quite some time.  Last time I was in, everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with good, smaller portion meals.  Nice outdoor cafe style.   I had eggs diablo: nice presentation and good melo ancho chili flavor (note: not diablo, but still good).  The bakers plate was also good. This place is still busy for breakfast at 1pm on a sunday: great sign for business."}
{"text":"Always a winner for breakfast, this spot has great variety, perfect pastry, and service that's definitely become consistently good. I am addicted to their two versions of the breakfast sandwich, but also love the hot cereal, sausage and gravy, and potato hash. Best bread and croissants in town (and possibly outside France)."}
{"text":"bought a loaf of the traditional sour-dough bread.  We've been scarfing it up at home.  I want to return and have breakfast.  it looked good."}
{"text":"On the pricier side for cafes, but everything on the menu is delicious. This restaurant is a great spot to study, grab coffee or lunch, or get brunch with friends. You can't resist grabbing one of their loaves for the road too!"}
{"text":"Went to Madison Sourdough this morning for breakfast at 11:00AM.  The restaurant was only half full.  We ordered a breakfast sandwich and an omelet.  After 40 minutes we went up to the counter and asked for the meal to go.  After 45 minutes we were on our way.  When we got home we realized both entrees were wrong - bacon was missing from the sandwich and that the side we ordered on the omelet was also wrong. I will never return, pricey, bad service."}
{"text":"Cute little place on Willy Street. There's not a ton of indoor seating but a quite sizable patio. We stopped by on the first nice Saturday in forever and unfortunately were unable to snag one of the patio seats (note to fellow Madisonians-please be kind and grab a seat only AFTER ordering your food!). The space inside is open and bright. The shelf of breads behind the counter, as others have remarked, is enticing. I'm not a huge bread eater at home so didn't purchase any but was definitely tempted. The menu, while small, is varied. The lunch menu is available during breakfast which makes me super happy. And Kickapoo coffee to boot! Refills are $1 though :( You order at the counter, get a number then grab a seat (hence the aforementioned request). Service was friendly though a bit distracted.  I had the sausage sandwich. Probably not worth trying. The pickled slaw was the highlight. The stone ground mustard was good too but certainly the sausage should have been the highlight. While listed as applewood smoked bacon sausage, it really just tasted like, well, nothing. Pretty much no flavor on its own. And all the components together just made for an odd flavor profile that just didn't quite mesh. The side salad was amazing and definitely the highlight of the meal.  My companion had the french toast which he thoroughly enjoyed. I'm not a huge fan of french toast in general but the one bite I had made me easily understand why he was so happy with it. The cherries were excellent and plentiful.   So why only four stars? Mainly pricing. Both dishes were $10 which just seemed a touch high, especially for my sandwich. And $1 for coffee refills? Come on now. It was a nice visit but not sure I'll be back-there's just too many other delicious breakfast places out there."}
{"text":"I like the simple, yet classic decor and the friendly staff. There are some fun things on their menu, like pumpkin pancakes and nutella. They also donate food to the local food pantry and I appreciate their efforts to avoid waste."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Both for eating in or grabbing a baguette to go.    The half sandwich and soup deal is a good deal as it lets you taste more things.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was great.  Served on warm bread with caramelized onions.  The gazapacho soup was delicious as well.  Nice and refreshing for the summer.    I like how they've decorated the place.  There's an variety of different wood tables to sit at.  The space can get somewhat loud though, since it's a pretty wide open space with exposed brick walls.  Free wifi comes in handy too to get some work done.    I've also grabbed baguettes from Madison Sourdough to go, which is nice.  Bread is much fresher and tastier than bread you'd buy at supermarkets."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast in Madison! We come to this spot time and time again. In fact, when my parents visit from out of town, it is a given that we go to Madison Sourdough for breakfast! My mom is legitimately obsessed with the French Toast dish. The cost is higher than some but worth every penny! The staff are friendly and eager to help you the moment you arrive. This place does great business and is a gem in our community!"}
{"text":"Outstanding house-made bread, as good as sourdough I've had in San Francisco. Five stars for the bread and highest recommendation.  The meals here are of good quality and utilize their excellent bakery, but the portions are on the very small side and execution is in the medium range. Plus, sandwiches here are as expensive as nearby sit-down-for-a-while places like Plaka Taverna or the Weary Traveler but without the execution, good sides, or comfort factor.  That said, this is a great place for a quick bite. You'll spend without regret but you're probably better off buying a loaf and going home to make your own meal."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars if I had reviewed 6 months ago, but they have changed the menu a little... I used to dream about their old duck fat hash. The perfect medley of savory and breakfasty and just plain deliciousness (loved the kale and grains!). Their new version isn't nearly as amazing, but I'm also not a huge fan of sweet potatoes and I think I'm in the minority there. Still good, but not my favorite.  The good thing about the menu change is that I now get to try new things!! Their biscuits and gravy--awesome. Their soups? Always great. I've never been unhappy with anything I've gotten, which is pretty great. I know this is a place I can get something and leave happy.  My only big caveat is that the iced tea is kind of expensive, and with a dollar per refill it's a little depressing. Love the flavors that they have but indulging my cravings means I feel like I've spent too much on brunch.  Their bread doesn't even really need a review--it's just perfect. Always. Grab a sample by the register. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The chefs and bakers are artists! The dishes are not only tasty, but looks attractive as well. Tried the quiche, strata, eggs benedict, baker's breakfast, paris-brest, vanilla coffee cream cake in my four visits so far, and none of them failed me! I simply love this place, both the cafe and the dessert bar.  Check out the artistic dishes~"}
{"text":"Met with a longtime friend for brunch and coffee and a good catchup session.  I had the breakfast sandwich, and a cappuccino, my friend had a mocha.  I wasn't very impressed by the food. I did enjoy the barista creating a pumpkin in my coffee foam and writing Boo! So cute! Ahhh what can i say, it's the little things.  I definitely will give their menu a couple more tries. I love the outdoor space although the indoor seating is not cozy at all.  Wooden tables and chairs and very high vaulted ceilings make the place feel a bit impersonal.  Still want to like Madison Sourdough, though."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a group of friends while I was in Madison for a weekend.  I had a sore throat so I just had the oatmeal.  There were 5 of us, and our food came out pretty quickly, which was nice.  The oatmeal was nice and hot, good and smooth, and sweetened nicely.  It was very good.  I also had cranberry tea to help with my throat, which was delicious."}
{"text":"MSCO is still my favorite bakery, but I've been thinking long and hard about the new baguettes lately. They are too hard/tough. I know they're aiming for an authentic French baguette, but no baguette I've ever eaten in France has even been this tough to tear on the first day. On day 2, maybe yes. But these new baguettes practically have me pulling muscles around my jaw on the first day, let alone on the second. To enjoy your leftover baguette in a sandwich on day 2, you need to get one from Batch or else risk pulling some facial muscles."}
{"text":"So many great choices for breakfast places in Madison. We chose Madison Sourdough; great decision.  We shared the biscuits and gravy and the French toast.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"Breadtastic.  This place makes me want to avoid the bread aisle at Whole Foods for life. A coffee and whole grain loaf, anyone?  Found this little gem on my way downtown for a meeting and had 30 min to grab breakfast, in fear of Starbuck's being my only non-fast food option.  Very cute exterior. Ordered a breakfast sandwich to write home about, with egg, aiolli, Gruyere cheese, and a side of greens.  Only qualm- tried to call in an order to go around 2:20 and was denied.    **To note: small lot in front, though lots of street parking."}
{"text":"Baguettes: excellent Chocolate croissant: excellent, especially when very fresh.  Granola Bar:  this is what keeps me coming back whenever I pass through the area. They provided the bars during a bike the barns ride a couple of years ago. I had never been to MSC before, but those bars have made me a loyal customer. Very tasty and seem slightly healthful, too."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. Old favorites are reliable, and there are usually new flavors that are both interesting and well executed.  Sadly, I have to knock off one star for the coffee. It tastes like it was filtered through a used gym sock. Always. Every time I've been there. That's a pretty big part of breakfast out, for me, so it's worth at least one star."}
{"text":"Excellent bread. Delicious menu. Genuine customer service. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great vibe with too many great choices. I had the Frarattoo and would highly recommend it. Very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg. Great baked goods as well."}
{"text":"Ugh, how do I feel?  Well, we had a love story on my first visit. I ordered an omelette with ham and cheddar. I loved it. Anytime I receive greens without an extra cost, I am impressed. The food was so generously portioned. The flavors worked together.   Then came the second visit. Biscuits and Gravy. My eggs were served on the biscuits and everything was drenched in gravy. My biscuits were not opened which I do not understand. I can not properly describe in words my annoyance when a restaurant does that. My husband ordered the eggs benedict. We planned to share. I realized that is difficult when they only give you ONE egg benedict. Why pluralize?  You give one egg for $10. That is a really cheap move."}
{"text":"Such a cute and quaint bakery m/ lunch spot. They only offer breakfast and lunch which is completely fine with me. They have different daily specials and a variety of items on their menu and bakery."}
{"text":"Finding good bread and good pastries is such a rare treat in the states, but man oh man do they offer these things in spades. I remember looking forward to grabbing one of their croissants as I wandered around the farmers market every week, but now you can enjoy their treats all the time! The peach danishes are just superb. It's a great place to pop in for a snack, grab some granola for home, share a breakfast with a friend, or sit down with some tea, bread, and cheese and do a little work."}
{"text":"They execute their bread and pastries at the absolute highest level. Many people in my hometown, Ann Arbor, and nationwide swoon about Zingerman's bakehouse, but Madison Sourdough is far superior in its bread and pastries. I have only tried a couple of things from the lunch menu but it was first rate as well"}
{"text":"I thought I had found breakfasting bliss with the Bacon and Egg Farrotto. But then I got a taste of the Biscuits and Gravy. That might be in the top three of best I have ever had. Also yay! Patio seating!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch this morning and it was amazing. Several breakfast dishes caught our eye, but we settled on an eggs benedict and eggs diablo.   The eggs benedict was amazing. The hollandaise lemony and light. I'm not usually a fan of sourdough, but their sourdough is changing my mind. The thick slice of sourdough instead of an english muffin served as the base for the eggs benedict. Crispy edges and soft center made it a beautiful textural counterpoint to the perfectly poached eggs. Mmm, the eggs. It's hard not to love breaking into that egg and watching that bright yolk melt into the light colors of the hollandaise. It's a study in yellow.   The eggs diablo are two poached eggs served in a beautiful red tomato sauce, completed by grilled baguettes to help scoop up all that delicious sauciness. And their pastry display as you wait to put in your order is just so unfair. I WANT IT ALL. The brioche, the danish, and the granola bar all look so, so amazing.   I haven't had their bloody marys yet, but Madison Sourdough may be my new favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"I love Madison Sourdough. On my last Saturday morning trip to the square I even ended up bypassing the farmer's market completely and ended up spending my morning here.    It's what I call a very fresh breakfast. Never a greasy mess (which I do crave on occasions) that leaves me feeling tired and slow all day, yet typically a nice salad combination with fluffy eggs accompanied always by a great piece of sour dough.   I enjoy the omelets the best (my go to), which are usually huge, and I convinced myself I need to buy a loaf of sour dough each time. They are fairly prices at around $4.50, and have a nice slicer machine if you want it done before you leave.   My last visit, I got the Eggs Benedict. It was very good, but for the price a small meal. I only received what seemed like a half portion of a typical eggs Benedict meal, which I felt was kind of strange. I ended up eating the other half of my wife's biscuits and gravy (which were  so...so tasting). I wish this meal was bigger, so be prepared if you order the eggs Benedict and you are super hungry, it is somewhat tiny. They were great, just not big enough for a guy like me."}
{"text":"I love their French toasts!! But didn't really like their sandwich. Their tea and pastries are pretty good as well :)"}
{"text":"Just let me take one of everything!  Not to mention the refreshing space!"}
{"text":"The City of Madison continues to impress me with its food offerings; most recently, Madison Sourdough was added to my ever-expanding list of places to go while in this terrific town.  Whether you're looking for a pastry, full-on breakfast, lunch, just a cup of coffee, or a crusty sourdough baguette to bring home, MS on Willy Street has you covered, and everything hits the sweet spot in your stomach.  We visited recently and had a delicious breakfast, and what a bonus that it happened to be a beautiful morning to sit outside on their patio. It felt like we were in Europe, mostly because of the adorable pooches lying obediently under the tables while their owners were enjoying their breakfast.  Started out with perfect cafe mochas. I am very picky about this drink--it has to have just the right ratio of espresso/chocolate/milk, and it's very easy for one to overpower the other, but theirs was spot-on.  The breakfast sandwich I had was a thing of beauty, and filled me up right up until dinner. Eggs (anyway you like 'em, I chose fried), cheddar cheese, and aioli, all served on a toasted croissant. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to add their house-smoked ham. It was so satisfying, and every component was delicious. Served with some lovely mixed greens on the side.  Other breakfast items range from the traditional (eggs benedict, omelets, biscuits and gravy ) to the less conventional (huevos rancheros, sourdough french toast, potato hash with duck fat and farro), as well as a daily quiche and strata offering. You can't go wrong, and whether you're trying to be healthy or gluttonous, it's all outstanding.  Lunch is similarly diverse: opt for a cubano, veggie pesto sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken salad or braised beef cheeks.  On Wednesday mornings they do something called \"Coffee with Cops,\" which is a great way to engage the community and give and receive information in an informal setting.  Service is uber friendly. It goes without saying that their bread is fantastic, and it's served at many restaurants in Madison.  I just love this place and plan to visit as much as I can when in Madison."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on a Sunday right around noon and the place was busy but the wait was short as the staff and kitchen kept up with the pace - nice! We ordered the biscuits and gravy and a butternut squash panini. The B&G was outstanding with great seasoning and the the biscuit was one of the best I have ever had.  The gravy was a little thin but when you mixed it with the biscuit it was heaven.  The butternut squash was a uniquely  delicious sandwich and we are already looking for an excuse to go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Best pastries, breakfast and bread in Madison hands down! But don't bother having lunch here, they are not staffed or organized to handle food (takes forever, comes out cold)."}
{"text":"Home cooked meals when not at home; one of the best eating out experiences.   I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict on my last trip to Madison and it was spectacular. I split this and the french toast with a GF. Trust me, you're going to want to take someone with you because 1. You will eat the entire meal served even after you decide you will take half to go and 2. The portion sizes are made for a very hungry lumberjack...   The service has never been slow or the customer made to feel not at home. The rustic and different styles of furniture gives the place a homelike and welcoming feeling. It is a very inviting atmosphere as you could sit there for hours sipping of tea or coffee and people watching or getting work done. If you sit in the rear room, you have access to see the chefs at work.   The last and best part of the restaurant is the bakery to go. All sorts of breads and pastries are baked and sold to the public. Loaves of bread by the whole or half sizes are sold. I take home a loaf on each visit.   This is a must go in Madison upon entering the city or prior to leaving!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that they changed the Eggs Diablo! It's still good, but I'm missing the tomato-softened brioche at the bottom. I don't think I will order it again, as it is now.  My favorite part of this restaurant is- surprise- the bread. The brioche rolls are incredible; a brioche roll and a bowl of carrot ginger soup is, in my opinion, one of the best lunches you can put together here. They have some pretty solid salad options as well.  It is usually pretty easy to pull together seating for a big group and you never feel rushed at Madison Sourdough. It is a great place to go with a group if you're hoping to sit a while."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great food, and great Gruyere Cheese Croissants! (My favorite) I stop here sometimes just for this savory croissant and a cup of latte. Mmm mmm mmm. Can't go wrong!  Their main menu meals are gorgeous as well and taste the way they look!   I also like coming here to study! If you go to the separate room next door, they have a nice mini bar area where you can stand and do work, very private and nice view outside!"}
{"text":"Being connected to MSCo Patisserie is a really good idea, because what better to accompany desserts than coffee! If I were to judge based on the coffee itself, I'd give it 3 stars, but boy was the barista/cashier incredibly rude. He embodies the worst excesses of hipsters - outward ennui that permeates into his surroundings as well as a holier-than-thou attitude that presumes his customers to be imbeciles needing euthanasia. During my visit I saw this in action twice. First, I asked him if they had pour-over options. He looked at me as if I had asked him what coffee is, and then proceeded to read down in a condescending voice what was written on the chalkboard menu. I was ready to let that slide, but while I was in the middle of drinking my coffee with friends he interrupts us and dismissively announces that they were closed, even though there was still ten minutes on the clock. Absolutely rude, and impacted in a real way my experience at this establishment.  Now notice that the coffee itself I rated three stars. I'm not really trying to say that their coffee is bad, but compared to the very high level of attention and professionalism displayed at many other coffee places, the coffee here needs to keep up if it is to survive. This might have gotten them by in the early 2000's, but America's coffee education has dramatically improved since. Even Starbucks nowadays has multiple brewed coffee options (I've gotten pour-overs at Starbucks before), so the fact that this barista hasn't even heard of a pour-over makes me worried about its coffee credentials. And the espresso I got was meh. Weak crema and a sour flavor suggest underextraction, so hence my unimpressed opinion of Madison Sourdough."}
{"text":"Checked out the cute cafe when we were in town for a funeral. And because my MIL works there. It's small and trendy.  The menu is on a big board so after deciding what we wanted, we were greeted by a pleasant young woman who took our order. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my husband got eggs Benedict.  My sandwich had a good flavor. It was on a brioche bun and topped with a sweeter coleslaw that was good. I believe the pickles they served were made in house and they were super yummy!!! My 1 complaint is that it was too juicy. It made the bun super soggy so I couldn't it eat like a sandwich.  My husband liked his dish mostly. He was disappointed in the eggs because they were too runny. It really made his dish soupy.  We sampled a morning bun while there. Flakiness like a croissant. It was delicious. The brownies were super rich and delicious.   It a great place to try. Fresh wholesome food and really nice staff!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with chutney, spinach, provolone, and aioli. Others in my party ordered the roasted beet Reuben, and soups of the day.   My grilled chicken sandwich was tender, juicy and packed with flavor. The combination of chutney and aioli was a delectable pairing of flavor. The sandwich came with a moderate side salad that didn't skimp on variety...We've all had those side salads that seem to consist only of lettuce.  I also enjoyed their beverage options and opted for a small blueberry Nessalla Kombutcha.   The beet sandwich was a unique and flavorful twist on the classic Reuben sandwich. It was surprisingly zesty and well-flavored.  Both soups were fresh, flavorful and equally filling!   It goes without saying that their breads are some of the best loaves around!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll admit...I wasn't overly excited about stopping in here for breakfast. The limited menu didn't grab me, but the boyfriend wanted to try it out.   Okay, so occasionally I guess he can win, because this was top notch.  I had the baker's breakfast, which consisted of fried eggs, baguette, dressed greens, ham, and creamy butter. Yep, basically the five food groups of deliciousness. EVERYTHING on the plate was perfect. The green salad was light, and the shaved fennel was a welcome addition. The eggs were SO tasty. Best fried eggs I've had in Madison. I'm not usually a \"ham\" person...but this isn't your grandma's Sunday dinner ham. This is house smoked tastiness. The baguette, of course, was just what a baguette should be. Crunchy outside, moist and chewy on the inside(topped off with some of that butter!).   My boyfriend had the french toast...and I believe he said \"This could very well be the best french toast I've EVER had\".   We also got a loaf of the Country Hearth bread, which we've been devouring with lunches this week!   Above all, the staff was super nice, in that way that I can only find in the WIlly St. area.  GO HERE."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a baguette-crispy and crunchy exterior with a yeasty middle.  While they do a solid breakfast/brunch, I find at times seating can be a challenge.  Beyond their baguettes, all of their other bakery is also on point.  Pro-Tip:  By twice as much bakery as you need because, if you are like me, you will eat at least half of it with some butter on the side."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend, and I was not expecting much. Maybe this worked in my favor because I was blown away. For such a simple layout and cafe feel, this restaurant/cafe manages to make an amazing breakfast that makes me want to come back again.  I was torn between getting the Eggs Diablo, Potato Hash, and eggs benedict. The eggs diablo looks amazing, but it had a chive cream so I went with the potato hash. I made a great decision because this plate was amazing. The potatoes are made with duck fat, and the combination of all the veggies, yolk (from the over easy eggs on top), and potatoes made me digging for more. The bowl itself is a bit small, but it's so filling. My friend thought I was going to lick the bowl (which I restrained from because I was in public). Amazing.  The menu is huge, and I recommend reading everything because the items are various and all look delicious. There are also little pastries at the counter, and they looked very sweet. You also have to order at the front and sit, but they deliver it to you; overall, the environment was very cute and cozy. I also believe they have WIFI because I saw many people eating while working and reading, which I think I will do from now on.  In the end, I bought a loaf of Country sourdough (YUMMY! And a whole loaf for $4.50! Yes). I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I spent an afternoon here to get done work done. Sometimes places don't like people who camp but no one here seemed too care. Lots of people came and went and actually one of them gave me some order remorse.   I had the butternut squash panini, molasses cookie and a red eye. Overall my meal was just okay. The coffee was excellent, cookie was a bit overcooked and the butternut squash panini had potential but missed the mark. The squash should have been cooked more and instead of balladic vinegar dripping off the sandwich, they could have makes it into the squash. It was a good size and the cheese on the sandwich added flavor, I just think there are easy ways to make this a bit better. The bread it came on was their sourdough multigrain miche which was pretty hearty and tasty. It came with a side salad that was great, a nice balance of greens and cabbage. They serve local kombucha which is awesome and I think speaks to either a hipster trend or a commitment to healthy menu options.  Though my food wasn't stellar, the staff was amazing, friendly and accommodating. And on my way out I saw someone with a bread and poached egg dish that like amazing and have me instant regret. So I would definitely go back, perhaps frequent this place. And instead of ordering a cookie from there, I'd go next door to the dessert bar and order something there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a brunch with friends. Casual atmosphere, order at counter restaurant. Food was good. I tried the sourdough French toast. Presentation was lovely, but the dish was more tangy than sweet. Best treat was a macaroon and the lavender lemonade."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the open, laidback, light and bright environment of Madison Sourdough. We've tried their bread at the farmers market before and were excited to try their storefront. They have great, fresh breakfast, delicious pastries, and awesome drinks. We've been a few times in the last couple of months. There's usually a bit of a wait in line but we've always been able to find a table. I loved the Eggs Diablo. Flavorful and lots of different textures. My boyfriend had the Eggs Benedict and it was good too. Good mocha and cool lavender lemonade. Friendly service, fresh ingredients, good stuff all around!"}
{"text":"Stop here one morning when I was in a hurry and picked up some scones and crescents.  The almond crescent makes my mouth water jus thinking about it but the scones were just ok."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch! A good mix of standard and innovative dishes, all done well.  No parking lot, just street parking, but worth the inconvenience :)  I've been here several times and have nearly always enjoyed what I've tried.  Things I've tried: Cafe: Quiche- It's a little different every day, but had a great creamy custard texture and is really flavorful. Comes with a simple and refreshing side salad.  Roasted Beet Rubin- If you are a former omnivore and miss a standard Rubin, this is a great replacement. Very flavorful, and the beets are a fun meat replacement. Would definitely recommend this one for anyone looking for something different to try.  Veggie Burger- Not my favorite. It's was not as flavorful as I was hoping and the veggie burger fell apart after the first bit. If you are a Veg, see above.  Radish and Beet Salad- Very fresh and had a great citrus dressing. It's seasonal, so you will have to wait until next summer to give this one a try. Very light and refreshing, but the portion size is huge, so plan on taking the leftovers with you as a snack for later.  Patisserie: Chai Tea Religieuse- As good as it gets! Perfectly balanced, the chai spiced pastry cream pairs nicely with the icing and pastry. It really is a religious experience. Can I get a witness?! I feel like I am authority on this because I spent 3 months in Paris and gained 12lbs in that amount of time. Primarily because all I did was eat pastries (and cheese) the whole time.  Opera Cake- First of all, it's beautiful. If that's not enough to draw you in, It is also a fabulous combo of coffee, chocolate and cake. Also, it's topped with gold leaf and a tiny macaron.  Lots of \"seat yourself\" seating inside and patio seating in good weather. They have a variety of unique beverages (and coffee) or a self-serve water station. This place also has a bus your own table situation, so be sure to not be a jerk and bring your plates to the back. :)"}
{"text":"This was a nice bakery we happened to find while driving through Madison. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. And they have free WiFi.   There is a wide array of pastries, breads, cakes, and made to order menu items. We tried the blueberry crossiant and cheese crossiant. Both were delicious.  We then later came back for a late lunch (just right before the kitchen closed at 3pm). We had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, and a salad. Both were good. The tomato soup had chunks of tomato which is not my cup of tea. The salad dressing could've been stronger in taste.  Service was very friendly. If I lived in Madison I would definitely check out this place"}
{"text":"Wow. Great bakery and coffee shop.  I'm very impressed by their vanilla and chocolate desserts. Very calm, relaxing, and upscale shop.  Their desserts are much tastier than WholeFood & Trader Joes.  I'm definitely coming back here.  Love this place!  A+"}
{"text":"Love love love madison sourdough!!! I probably purchase a madison sourdough baguette twice a week.. it is my comfort food go to. Nothing beats coming home from work to a cheese board with a glass of wine and a few slices of a warm and crispy sourdough baguette. 10/10 would recommend.   I brunched there recently and had the eggs diablo.. long story short I was a member of the clean plate club! So amazing!! I want to try everything on their menu. My only complaint is that the coffee was not free refills and I didn't have any cash on me .. so I was limited to one cup. I'm used to being a spoiled American at breakfast places where the drip coffee flows freely and is in abundance! They also had a good selection of various tea / lemonade / lavender infused type drinks which would appeal to me on a hot summer day  Their patio is great. There's an ample amount of seating indoors.. you order at the counter and your food is brought to you when it's ready. Parking can be a challenge on the weekend during peak brunch hours."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I have not written a review for this place yet considering how much I adore it and how many times I've been here. I must have written the review in my head and totally forgot to transfer it to Yelp.  Anyways I LOVE this place. My favorite breakfast item is their Eggs Diablo. The name makes it sound super spicy but it really isn't, it's more of a tangy zesty heat. Their eggs benedict is also great. They almost always have a french toast special on the weekends. Considering how awesome their bread is you can't go wrong with any of their french toasts. One weekend I got to try the bacon bourbon french toast. Delicious, you could definitely taste the bourbon throughout and their bacon was crunchy and caramelized with sugar.   They have a large selection of drinks.  I'm not a coffee person so I'm grateful for all the other times of drinks they have and I am forever in debt to them for introducing me to my favorite new tea drink. The London Fog! Half early grey with lavender and frothy steamed milk with vanilla. I love it so much I've invested in my own milk frother for home. They also have matcha powder tea if that's your thing. It tastes a little too grassy for my liking.  All their breads I will warn have a super crunchy exterior. They are all reasonably priced. We bought 6 ciabatta rolls to use for burgers, 2 seed and grain loafs, and a traditional sourdough hearth roll for about 15 dollars. They also have yummy sweet pastries you can buy to go as well. Or eat while sipping a London Fog.   They are changing their setup a bit. The patisserie items next door are moving to the main store. The patisserie they are planning on turning into a workshop area where they will have classes.   Final note, there is ice cream here! Save some room after brunch for some delicious ice cream. Their chocolate is super chocolaty, almost fudge like, the lady behind the counter when giving me a sample had to use a metal spoon because the wooden sampling spoon broke, proof of how dense it is. I've been told their maple bourbon flavor is their best but I've had yet to get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation for the coffee from a local roaster.  It can be difficult to find parking nearby due to its popularity and other stores.  There is a register for bread only but it seems to get ignored when the brunch line gets long.  We had some caneles and cookies which were very good.  They were out of the vanilla ones on a Saturday but still had the lemon and anise (separate, not combined into 1).  Chocolate chip cookies are reasonably priced and quite filling.  My wife had a vanilla latte and it was overly sweet to the point where we asked for a new one.  They gladly re-did it and asked her to check.  I had a cortado from their JBC roasters which was done well.  Overall, a place I would return to try their brunch options and more pastries."}
{"text":"Great food, coffee and overall business but a little pricey which is to be expected in this area"}
{"text":"My fiance and I first stopped by yesterday. We were starved and just picked the first place we saw that was actually open. Best impulse choice of my week.   I got the pulled pork \"reuben\" and my fiance got the grilled cheese. I don't think I can bring myself to actually call what I got a reuben, given the lack of corned beef, but holy fuck they can call it whatever they want. I think it was the most satisfying panini I have ever eaten. I can't even describe it. My favorite part was the delicious smokey-ness of the pork. I stole a bit of the grilled cheese and was surprised by the cauliflower inside. So I expect that all of their sandwiches have a twist but daaaamn do they know how to twist. It wasn't some random thing thrown in just for some trend, they add things or change them cause it tastes gooooood.  And that's how I found myself back here in less than 24 hours later, trying their breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is brilliantly wonderful... the bread is pretty great, pastries and croissants are excellent - although I have to say I prefer Batch Bakehouse down the block - and the breakfast and brunch menu is stellar, not to mention the homemade ice cream (affogato!), good coffee/espresso, and awesome staff and bakers... a must for repeat visits for so many reasons..."}
{"text":"I love the variety of breads and pastries. I tried the eggs diablo and it was the perfect portion of spicy awesomeness. This is definitely a local gem."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in awhile. A couple years ago this was my FAVORITE place for breakfast. Unfortunately I can't rave about it this time.  I had the ham & cheese omelette. The side salad that came with it was heavy. It used to be a nice and light bed of greens only with a lite lemony dressing. Today it was more like coleslaw, very disappointing. The omelette was so-so; it wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the money being charged.   The pastries were still good though! But Batch Bakehouse is better!!!  Thankfully in Madison there are plethora of good places with more reasonable prices to eat. We won't be wasting time or money here again."}
{"text":"In Madison, I find that there aren't that many good bakeries around - and certainly very few that offer the variety and quality that Madison Sourdough does. This quaint and often packed little bakery offers several things - a selection of freshly baked bread, a full brunch/lunch menu, sweet and savory pastries, and even ice cream.   Each time I've visited has been on the weekend, and there's always a long line. With crowds brings exclusivity, as well, so do know that if you want your favorite bread (especially sourdough baguettes and loaves), you should arrive early to get your choice.  I was impressed by the menu - lots of delicious items, both savory and sweet - and loved the flavors of every dish I tried. Their breakfast croissant is decadent - soft, buttery croissant with a fluffy egg, melted cheese, and herbed butter. Simple but delicious! The side salad was also tasty...not dripping in salad dressing and the lettuce tasted like it was from the Farmer's Market. Their Cheddar-Chive breakfast sandwich is equally delicious. If you stop by for lunch, I recommend the reuben. I expected it to be brimming with meat, but the proportions were perfect, making the sandwich both delicious and easy to eat+enjoy.   While I was impressed by their menu items and bread, I was less than impressed with their bakery selection. In particular, I was so excited to try their macarons because they looked beautiful, but they were really dry and chalky. Not at all flavorful and delicate.   Overall, Madison Sourdough is a lively, casual cafe that's perfect for a quick brunch or sourdough purchase. Do try their brunch items and breads - skip the macarons and sweet bakery items!"}
{"text":"I like Madison Sourdough because you can tell they put a lot of effort into preparing fresh, locally sourced meals and breads.  It's a very typical Willie St. ambience, if you're familiar with the area.  My only complaint is the menu isn't terribly diverse and it can sometimes take a while to get food (~20 mins) during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago for breakfast.  We got a breakfast sandwich, 2 loaves of bread, and an omelet.  The omelet and sandwich came with salad, which was a little weird for breakfast but it wasnt bad.  Portions were appropriate.  Bread was great.  I enjoyed the visit and would come again"}
{"text":"Try the Breakfast Cereal. It's steel cut oats, quinoa, and blueberries topped with fresh apple. It also just so happens to be vegan and gluten-free. Deeeeee-licious and super filling!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for breakfast here and was very impressed with their quiche. It comes with a small cup of aioli, which is totally not needed, and a small, perfectly composed side salad. The quiche was possibly the most fluffy and soft quiche I've ever eaten. That day, they had turnips and parsnips in there and while those were not my fave veggies, it worked with the quiche. I don't know how they get it that fluffy. Butter? Or sorcery? The crust was also very tender and flaky. Best crust ever. The side salad was a perfect foil to the richness of the egg pie."}
{"text":"5 stars for allow dogs! That create special atmosphere when seating outside.  The food is always very good and fresh.  I don't like to pay $1 for coffee refill. It's wrong.  And the \"sweets\" are way too expensive."}
{"text":"I always stop here on my car ride home to Detroit.  The last two times, I stuck stoically by the Miche, which is a bread unexplainable unless you've had it. (And had it done well, such as here) Today I branched out and added the pepida loaf:  phenomenal!  Full of air pockets inside with a crispy, yet still chewy exterior.  Amazing, as all bread here tends to ve also co queried the cinnamon roll.  Instead of that heavy breadball slathered in cloyingly sweet frosting, theirs is light, almost croissant-like and dusted in a cinnamon throughout.  (Warning:  if you're a Cinnabon-at-the-mall fan, this is probably not for you)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! It was hard to decide what to order because the pastries looked great and the placed smelled like heaven. I ordered the quiche with mushroom and the biscuits with rhubarb jam and omg!  Highly recommended, I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Coffee: Meh. Bread: Decent. Service: Lame. Decor: Boring, Cold, Uninviting.  Nothing much to say about the food or coffee. But, there is a lot to say about the boy-man who took my order. First, he was wearing unprofessional attire. His oddly tight clothes and artificially high pitched voice made me feel uncomfortable as if I were at the gay nightclub next door.  Secondly, he was rude and clueless. He could not answer basic questions about their drinks and made you feel stupid for asking. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"There are only a few things one needs to know. Ahem...  They make a lot of bread, so they're good at it. Yet despite fancy names, the bread will taste like most good bread you've ever had.  The sandwiches are all around $10. They're pretty filling, and if you choose the right one, it can be split.  There are free samples at the register!  It's totally not at all creepy to longingly stare through the windows in the back at the bakers plying their trade. Not creepy at all."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries! I always look forward eagerly to their stand at the Farmer's Market. I'm not a huge danish fan usually, but they have the best damn cheese danish I have ever had, and now I buy one pretty much every week in the summer. When they aren't sold out by the time I get there.     I cannot comment on any of their other food, since I have only had the pastries. It's probably a 5 star kind of place overall, but I don't want to rate what I haven't tried."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, I've had a great experience! Their eggs Benedict were amazing, but the sourdough bread was a little too hard for my tasting. Their basil gelato was magnificent however!"}
{"text":"Well i just came back from san fran and this place is like my place for bread in town.  Not san fran sourdough, but Ill take it!"}
{"text":"Update: 8/23: got the breakfast sandwich to go. Came out as I arrived, was hot and the most delicious thing ever. Buttery, buttery croissant--this is not the dried out thing you might find in a cafeteria type sandwich. Must have been at least two eggs --if not three. Salad balanced it out. I was ready to work all day after that meal."}
{"text":"They make the best sourdough baguette ever! Yum! Anything I have ever gotten from them is delicious!"}
{"text":"An outstanding place for lunch or brunch.  Friendly service (basically at the counter, though they bring your food out.)  Excellent bread, fresh ingredients, a cheery atmosphere that wasn't too cheery for a non-morning person...  I had a sandwich with salmon and avocado, I believe.  Quite good, as was the corn chowder, and the sweet potato latke we all shared.  Juice and lemonade were good, though not fresh-squeezed as I'd hoped.  We had a couple of pastries, too, and they were very good."}
{"text":"It's a fine bakery, but at the end of the day the food is expensive and not my favorite.  Take the breakfast sandwich, for example, it's $8 without meat and then an additional $3 just to add bacon or ham. Madison has so many yummy breakfast sandwiches without up charging for meat, so why would I get this here?   The smoked salmon Benedict is drenched in hollandaise. Too much. I liked the biscuits and gravy, but felt that it was kind of like a soup. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich recently and the bread looked like grocery store bread.  You're not getting anything special with the ambiance or anything either, there's no table service, so while it's ok, it's never my first choice.  Maybe I just need to order that perfect dish and I will change my mind?"}
{"text":"\"F!\" I must say that I was a little nervous when I heard that MSC was moving to the east side, what with the amazing Batch just down the street.  NO CONTEST.  The food at MSC is incredibly overpriced and pathetically uninspired. For instance, their roasted veggie salad is nothing more than a few scraps of lettuce topped with slimy, translucent grilled onions.  It cost eight dollars.  When I asked for more vegetables, I just got more greasy onions.  Another time I got the steel cut oats, which were cold and topped with half-frozen blueberries.  Besides the food, the waitstaff exudes a \"lights are on, nobody home\" demeanor, and the space feels like the breakroom of a warehouse."}
{"text":"Really great bread selection, we tried the fig, the cracked rye, and a baguette all of which were awesome. But I was fairly disappointed with my breakfast. I got the sweet potato hash (sweet potato with onion, cauliflower, greens, and mushrooms), but oddly the sweet potato had almost no flavor.  I got it because my husband had a sweet potato hash elsewhere the day before and it was awesome, but this didn't live up. They did make me a perfect fried egg though, and the toast was so good to dip into it.  The hubby got the duck egg breakfast, which he said was great."}
{"text":"I tried out the ham and cheese omelette for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. I was all psyched up for the french toast, but they were out so I settled for a normal-sounding omelette. The eggs were nice and light and it was super cheesy. Served with a small salad and several baguette slices, this was a great way to fuel up.  I also tried my first macaroon (the raspberry variety) in the pastry shop. It was so delicious and bigger than other macaroons I have seen. A bit pricey for me to make it a regular thing ($2.75 a piece, I believe), but they will make a great once-in-a-while treat as I explore Willy Street!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and in a nice street for a stroll.  I went here at noon and had the half sandwich half soup which came with salad anyways so I got all three yay! The salad was dressed well but not overdone and I loved the tomato bisque soup.  It really hit the spot on a cold day.  The sandwich was the mushroom cheese on ciabatta (the vegetarian one) and it had a great lemony mayonnaise.  They make fresh bread there too for a decent price.  I really enjoyed the bread,  next time I'll buy a roll before they run out. I'll be back to try their eggs Benedict which looked good too."}
{"text":"Major Update:  Someone finally figured out how to do sandwich right in Madison.  Tried their grilled goat cheese + butternut squash and hummus + grilled veggie for lunch today. Phenomenal! Solid 5 stars including the side salad. And bonus for very friendly cashier - in fact, I've never seen anything but smile and courteous service from MSC whenever I go."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast today with some friends and was very impressed. It was fast and quality food and very cozy atmosphere. The fresh baked items were amazing and the biscuits and gravy were pretty good. Friends had the eggs Benedict and they thought it was amazing. All fresh food and great assortment of fruit Asa side. Another friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I tried the soup (which I normally despise) and it was awesome! There was a really strong mustard or something in the grilled cheese which kind of was too much for us so may want to get it on the side or maybe we just are weird...  The Danish, granola bar, Browniie and scone were all amazing to go treats as well."}
{"text":"The blueberry danish is amazing. I never pick the blueberry option as a first choice, but it'd been recommended, and I'm awfully glad I tried it. The blueberries were small and popped with flavor, and were layered on top of a nice smear of sweet cheese. The danish dough seemed pretty croissant-y - although this made me realize I'm not sure what the difference between the two is anyway. A little research suggests danish dough has egg while croissant does not, but I don't know. In any case, I thought this dough was fantastic, and it made me want to explore the croissants here. We also tried a pecan danish, since we were told they were rarely available, and while that was fine, the blueberry was better. I bet the raspberry one would be good too!  The sandwiches sound wonderful as well. Also, pretty nice bathrooms in the back!"}
{"text":"We made 100 great bread jokes here. It was the yeast we could do. This place is no joke dough (is that spelt right?) -- really wonderful snacks, splashes and slices. YUM"}
{"text":"I really wish I loved this place. It's beautiful with delicious pastries and bread. The almond croissants and cinnamon rolls are ridiculously good.   However, I've ordered a chicken sandwich and a coffee drink from here and was very disappointed. The meal was average, I don't even remember what I got but it was overpriced for the quality.   The most disappointing thing about this place was when some of my friends ordered coffee drinks. One said her latte was bad. Another said his earl grey tea was weak.   And I ordered an iced mocha. I wasn't asked about the sizes or anything, but the lady at the register said a price around $5.25. Over $5 for a coffee drink? I'd only expect this if it was the best i could get or if I was getting a ridiculous frappuccino from Starbucks or something. But this was the worst iced mocha I've ever had. It tasted like chocolate flavored water with a dash of espresso, all for over $5. Yikes.   I'd recommend going to Lazy Janes for food or an actual coffee shop to get any kind of decent drink."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've only been here a couple times and they have not let me down. I've had their beef, and egg salad sandwiches, chicken panini and smoked zucchini soup - amazing flavors all over! I'm going back for more and I got my eyes on some chocolate croissants. I've thought about purchasing their bread, which I notice many people coming I  just to get a loaf...but then I realize I probably couldn't replicate the flavors. I'll just have to visit more often.  http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2013/10/madison-sourdough/"}
{"text":"It took me a while, but I finally heeded Yelptern Izzy's advice to try out the brunch at Madison Sourdough.  Izzy is a bit of a brunch connoisseur and she considers Madison Sourdough to be the penultimate local brunch option.  She may be on to something.  After visiting in the morning as part of a four-hour hash crawl to sample their divine potato hash, I was so impressed that I returned later that afternoon with the rest of my family.  It's definitely in the upper echelon of Madison brunch options, rivaling such breakfast stalwarts as Graze and Marigold.  Both the kitchen and the bakery dole out some serious culinary magic.  The potato hash cooked in duck fat was nearly flawless.  The vegetables (Yukon gold potatoes, onion, butternut squash, Brussels sprouts, beets) were deeply roasted and well seasoned.  The over easy eggs were expertly cooked and the runny deep orange yolks really helped pull the dish together.  The only modification I would make would be to add a small salad to balance out the richness of the dish.  My daughter devoured the Sourdough French Toast that came with a pile of dense cinnamon flavored whipped cream.  The French toast had a wonderful exterior crunch to balance out the custardy interior.  The hash crawl crew loved the orange gateau basque with its creamy citrus filling.  The restaurant is well staffed.  Despite visiting at the peak of the brunch rush, service went smoothly.  We found a table a couple of minutes after we placed our order and the food arrived a short time later.  While you bus your own table, a staff member dropped by our table to see what we thought of our meal.  We also ended up meeting one of the co-owners of Madison Sourdough during our visit.  He learned about the hash crawl from our group's mini-social media blitz and gave us a brief tour of the production facility after our meal.  The menu changes seasonally and I look forward to trying the next iteration of dining options.  If the kitchen can consistently produce at the level I enjoyed this past weekend, I will be bumping up the rating to five stars."}
{"text":"I am in love... with all of Willy Street, but mostly with Madison Sourdough. The high ceilings and brightly painted walls make the space open and inviting. It also helps that everyone on the staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. (:   My first foray into the wonderful world of MSCo was the pulled pork sandwich. Now, I've had my share of pulled pork sandwiches, and for a place that doesn't specialize in barbecue meats, MSCo makes a damn good one. The pork is juicy and the horseradish aoli really brings out the flavor in the meat. I devoured it. Oh, and did I mention that MSCo also makes a mean iced chai latte? Because they do. It is delish! :9  After lunch, I snuck away with a few baked goodies as well...a brownie and a sourdough baguette. Neither made it home in one piece.   I don't typically have a huge sweet tooth, but I caved at the truffle-like consistency of the brownie. Each bite practically melted in my mouth..and as hard as I tried to save half of it for my friend, the entire brownie was safely tucked away in my belly before I even pulled into my parking spot at home. Oops.   The baguette was another winner. I like my sourdough bread sour - but not overwhelmingly so - and MSCo's was perfection. (: Unfortunately it does dry out pretty quickly..but a few spritzes of water and a couple minutes in the oven and it comes out freshly baked (almost).   BRB MSCo, I am addicted. :Q"}
{"text":"This place surprised me. Good coffee at 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon is unheard of, but I found it here. I did not try the bread but I will. I did order a croissant, and despite Rachel F feeling that they didn't live up to her summer in France, I will evaluate them based on my many experiences in France as well as my many travels all over the world and extensive sampling of croissants, I can say, they are not bad. In fact, the taste is actually pretty good. They are not truly buttery or flaky as a croissant should be, they are more dense, bread like. In fact they are more of a crescent roll than a croissant, but if you just evaluate them against other cafe croissants, you would agree they are not bad.,"}
{"text":"Dear Clausen's. I tried, I really tried to like your bread after the original owners retired. But where is the authentic flavor that made the 3 hour drive worth it? I was heartbroken until I stopped into the MADISON SOURDOUGH COMPANY. Not only did they have that elusive European style loaf that others woefully imitate, but their Cubano is one of the best I've had. Es tut mir leid, Calusen's, but I'm moving on."}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough has delicious breakfast.  Their Quiche of the day does not disappoint. Breakfast sandwich is melt in your mouth yum. They make a mean eggs benedict. Mochas have always been great. The phone service can be a little slow, but the employees are always attentive and helpful in the business itself which is most important.   Definitely check out Madison Sourdough while you're in town."}
{"text":"I love that they're open at 6:30 because so many cafes in Madison seem to open at 7:00 for some reason.  That aside, I love the bread, the coffee and the pastries.  I've yet to sample other areas on the menu, but I'm sure it's equally good.  The country style sourdough is fantastic, and the miche is delicious!  Service is outstanding and very friendly.  I love that I can walk there in less than five minutes whenever I have to, which is often.  UPDATE: I went there yesterday and sampled the Polenta style bread.  As I was talking with the woman behind the counter about it (I was non-plussed), she mentioned the Walnut Bread.  I mindlessly uttered, \"I wonder what that tastes like\" under my breath and before I realized that she had heard me...she had taken down a loaf and cut me off a sizable piece to try.  NICE!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich with the apple and cheese has an incredible mix of flavor and texture.  It is excellent. The side salad that comes with it is kind of disappointing, not much to it, maybe adding some cheese or nuts would be good.  The only reason why Madison Sourdough is not 5 stars is the price, $10 for a sandwich with a side of lettuce? A little too much for a causal lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, was not disappointed. The beet Reuben is amazing and with the tomato soup made a fantastic meal. They even give you a little side salad with mustard dressing. The cold brew on tap was good, and I love that they offer almond milk. All around great experience and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My last review was from before MSD moved over to Willy Street, and I had only bought their bread from the co-op. I am very happy about the move! The space is open and full of natural light, and the staff are super friendly (unfortunately, I can't say the same about all of my potential study-spots on Willy St).They have solid coffee, and they don't mind me camping out with my beverage all day to get work done.  As I said before, the bread here is clearly the best in Madison. It's clear that they know what they are doing with ingredients and technique, as the breads have great texture and flavor.   The only reason I gave MSD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of some of the non-bread-loaf items I've tried. I went there for breakfast, and my omelet was lacking . . . it just didn't have a ton of flavor, and knowing that Sophia's is just across the isthmus, I won't be trying that again. I also wasn't terribly impressed with the croissant's texture (I am biased after spending this past summer in France, though!).   Overall, I love this place, and highly recommend the bread, sandwiches, and coffee."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich while my husband ordered the ham and cheddar omelet. Both were large portions and came with a side salad. My sandwich was on a perfectly flaky croissant. We also got the morning bun to split, which is actually just a kouign aman but delicious nonetheless. My latte was tasty too. Service was friendly and chatty. We were there at about 8:30 on a Saturday morning and it was busy but not crowded. Lots of peole stopping in to buy some fresh bread and baked goods to go. They have some tables outside, which was perfect because we were with our dog."}
{"text":"The chocolate brownie at Madison Sourdough could end world war.  (I'm certain of it.)  Forget about awkward insides like nuts or chips that just get in the way and slow you down, and ditch the dusting of powdered sugar or even worse fudge, (stop putting fudge on brownies America) and what you're left with is a brownie in its purest form. Rectangle shaped chocolate. That is all.   I'm not certain what chocolate they use, but it's rich and it's creamy, and the texture of the brownie itself has a certain moistness that's beyond description. And I don't even like the word moist! But it's the only word in my lexicon to describe just how sink-your-teeth-in-drool-worthy these things are. And on one hand it's hard for me to overlook the delicious pasty that blankets the two glass cases at Madison Sourdough, but on the other hand the brownie stands out as the best option to cure my craving each and every time. It's like a cacao beacon begging me to eat it.   I've also had breakfast and lunch, sipped some strong brew and on a rare occasion got a cookie (a cookie!) and while tasty nothing tops what is possibly the best brownie I've ever eaten. (And I'm a brownie connoisseur. I grew up in a home where brownies were as popular as Real Housewives spin offs. 5 or so home-baked varieties stocked our freezer and wound up in school lunches. So I know.)   In conclusion.... get a brownie. It's the secret to world peace."}
{"text":"How much do I love Madison Sourdough? Welllllll, I went two days in a row and ordered the same thing both times. Yup.  My first visit was on a sunny Wednesday morning, and I met the lovely Stacey L here for some breakfast and work on our laptops. The first thing I noticed was the gorgeous patio, but once I made my way inside, I was in awe of the amount of natural light that was pouring in. There's an adorable breakfast bar, tons of seating, and the vibe was happy and cheerful.   It's going to be hard to ignore all of the pastries. But I believe in you - you can do it. If I have one recommendation, it's to order the Baker's Breakfast. I legit had it two mornings in a row and it was just so satisfying and well done! This gorgeous plate is loaded with shaved smoked ham, two eggs over easy, a side salad,  a baguette, and European butter. Yeeeeeah. What could be a better start to the day?! The coffee was strong, the cookie I finally caved in and bought was delightful, and I'm just crazy about this place.  I will 100% be returning on my next trip to Madison!"}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough is absolutely incredible. They offer great a great lunch menu, latte options, and pastries. The food tastes delicious and is a decent price. The employees are friendly and willing to help with any questions you have about what they offer.   My favorite order is the Hawiian Pork Kalbi (smoked braised pork, sweet onion-pineapple sauce, and creamy slaw* on a brioche burger bun). It tastes wonderful. I also ordered a raspberry cream puff that was HUGE.  Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good bread really goes a LONG way! I ordered the curry chicken sandwich and it came with a side salad. The sandwich was delicious, and the bread took it to the next level. The dressing on the salad was an unexpected bonus! If you're looking for a fresh meal for a decent price, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"The best almond croissant I've ever had. And my omelet was fantastic, too, and HUGE, I couldn't finish it all (because I ate the croissant first, which was also huge) The side salad that came with the omelet was perfectly dressed and delicious. The outdoor seating which meant I could bring my pooch and the top notch friendly service put MSCO in first place for breakfast for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The expensive salmon sandwiches we ordered for lunch were tiny, but piled high and open-faced, causing them to messily fall apart with every bite. The sandwich toppings did taste really good, but the bread underneath was dry, hard and dense, making it unpleasant to eat. The service was fine and the place seemed clean and had a nice decor, in a corporate-trying-to-look-indie-but-non-threatening kinda way, so despite these issues I was going to give the place 2 stars... then I tried the small side salad. It sounds intriguing from the description in the menu, but it's basically just a pile of lettuce doused in vinegar. Absolutely disgusting.  We didn't order beverages or bakery, so I can't comment on the quality there, but the drink prices looked similar to other cafes. At least when it comes to lunch, though, this place charges way too much for way too little, and what they do give you is mediocre at best. Definitely not recommended.  Pros: Watch your food being made, tasty salmon, cheap drinks Cons: Expensive, dry dense bread, miniscule portions, disgusting salad dressing"}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough's eggs Benedict is one of my favorite breakfasts in the city. Period. Available in a veggie option, I always go with the ham - a thin slice, slightly smokey ham paired with a top-notch hollandaise sauce. Honestly, the best part of the dish may be the delicious grilled sourdough that it's built around. The last several times I've visited, the poached eggs have been overcooked, but I'm hopeful it's just a passing phase in the kitchen.   It's a warm, bright spot on Willy Street. Great for a quick solo breakfast or grabbing a pastry and coffee with friends. Their pastry selection is awesome and their breads are the best in town. Give this joint a try - I think you'll like what you find."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick breakfast on my way to work. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which included egg and cheddar on a croissant with a side salad. The croissant was amazing! Very buttery and crispy on the outside. The sandwich was delicious and the tangy dressing on the side salad provided a nice contrast.   My mom came here for lunch the same day and ordered a tuna sandwich, which she thought was ok (I can't review that, though, since I didn't try it myself!)."}
{"text":"This is an adorable bakery with an exceptional breakfast and lunch foods! They had wonderful coffee drinks to the classic baked breads and pastries Madison has come to know and adore (devour).  When they are open, they have a wonderful selection of classic breakfast dishes like eggs and French toast. They also have a wonderful veggie burger which you can add an egg too and an excellent grilled cheese. Another wonderful thing is that they usually always have a special dish going on.  They have quite a few tables for people to sit at and do work. When the weather is nice, they have seating outdoors! A nice thing they have is free wifi for people who use there laptops there!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't go here more often, but I always forget about this little spot nestled just back from Willy St.  Outdoor seating in the warmer months, and two indoor seating areas year round.  The front room is loud and bustling on the weekends when it's busy, but you can find a bit more peace and quiet in the back.  Yesterday I had the eggs Benedict with smoked local trout.  In an homage to their namesake, the eggs are served over a massive slice of sourdough bread.  This gets mixed reviews: the bread is tasty and perfect for sopping up hollandaise, but the crust was thick enough that even the serrated knife that comes with it wasn't effective in cutting it down to size and the somewhat less effective fork literally bent.  Their eggs are pre-poached (I assume to keep things moving quickly during the brunch rush) but this means they don't come out soft and runny.  Next time I'll probably take them up on their offer to substitute an over easy egg.  The trout is perfection, though, and the hollandaise really shines, so I'm willing to forgive the other slight blunders."}
{"text":"Since I missed my past barista job and daily coffee intake, I spent a lot of time visiting local coffee shops the first month moving to Madison. After trying many shops, Madison Sourdough is by far my favorite. Fresh, local food with a side of the best iced coffee I've tasted in Madison. Now once a week I find myself walking over for a fresh scone and cup of coffee. Everyone is very friendly, especially the owner. Great location and provides a nice little outdoor section. I highly suggest stopping by if you're looking for a cup of refreshing true iced coffee or want to pick up fresh bread."}
{"text":"Best croissants in Wisconsin - that's no exaggeration.    I love coming to Madison Sourdough to pick up pastries for the office in the morning.  But I've recently learned it's a great place for lunch too!  This may sound trivial, but my favorite part of eating a salad for lunch here is the delicious brioche croutons.  I never thought I would find a crouton memorable, or worth writing about, but here I am."}
{"text":"Where should I start? Madison Sourdough has a fresh bakery, fresh baked bread, breakfast items, and lunch items. What more could you ever want?!   I stopped in and grabbed one of everything. (I'm exaggerating.) For lunch, I opted for the quiche of the day. The crust was delicious! To be honest, that's all I focused on because it was so good. It came with a side salad, which wasn't my thing. Instead, I grabbed an almond croissant as a side. De-lic-ious!   My friend got the bread and jam plate. The plate was full of different, fresh bread. She got to choose from five different jams. She opted for the blackberry jam. Oh. My. Gosh. So good.   This place is an awesome, local spot in a hip part of town. Grab breakfast or lunch and pick up a few extra goodies for the rest of the day!   From out of town? Walk up and down Willy for a fun afternoon. There are plenty of shops and bars to pop into!"}
{"text":"Freshest and some of the best bread I've had in Mad town! Croissants are delicious. I have no doubt in my mind all the baked goods are amazing.   This is also one of my fav breakfast/brunch spots. Eggs Benedict. EGGS BENEDICT! Best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. Good coffee too! Overall, a little pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"I took the advice to come for breakfast and loved it. Service is was bright and friendly.   They have different breads depending on the day of the week. There is a mix of some great items on the menu for breakfast. Decadent items such as different omelettes, sour dough french toast, the bakers breakfast with eggs and ham. The coffee is great and the pastries are even better. The danishes and croissants melted in our mouths!   T-shirts, aprons, and tote bags are available for purchase. Pretty good quality I'd have to say. The bags also have a story behind it."}
{"text":"Review has nothing to do with quality of products but the service. I've been here so many times but today was ridicoulius when it came to service. The cashier and one of the cooks thought it was a great time to carry a conversation with a friend/customer while people are waiting in line for simple things like coffee from me and a loaf of bread from the customer behind me. Finally when I did get served I couldn't believe the attitude from the cashier and the eye rolling when he gave me my coffee and I said thanks."}
{"text":"HASH!  The sweet potato duck hash is awesome.  A great hash must have cooked potatoes and veggies, of course, but contrasting textures are key. The sweet potato hash has tender potatoes with some crispy caramelized veggie bits--perfect.  Add two over easy eggs and even better.  Keep in mind that this hash won the informal number one hash in Madison prize among a group of Yelpers sampling different breakfast hashes.  Orange galette (open faced tart) is delicious yet not cloyingly sweet nor filling.    Looking forward to trying more in the future; on the other hand, I may just stick to the sweet poato hash."}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough holds a special place in my heart. The bread they offer, as the name suggests, is definitely what got them where they are. Whether at their location on Willy St or at their stand at the farmers market (which opens back up soon!!) the bread is incredibly fresh and ALWAYS delicious. I also always love their grilled cheese if you're looking for a bite to eat. They have a good selection of local coffee and tasty teas as well. The staff is very friendly and helpful.   Oh and I'd be crazy if I didn't mention a bourbon pecan bar I had once that completely changed my life. I had assumed I didn't like bourbon flavored deserts, as I don't generally like the liquor itself BUT this was amazing. If you are lucky enough to be there when they're still selling these - you'd be crazy to turn them down."}
{"text":"Better for their brunch options than their baked foods. Me and my friends have a standing brunch date here once a month and everything is always good. They have decent WIFI, ok coffee, good bread, and delicious entrees. I'd recommend the eggs diablo, personally. My one caveat is that the seating isn't super comfortable, but if you're not planning on sitting around for hours, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for brunch on a lovely Sunday morning around 11am so it was crowded, yet not overly crowded. The line to order moved smooth, as I was waiting I was tempted to buy a loaf of bread and an almond croissant, but I didn't. I ended up ordering the eggs benedict and found a seat in the back room.   The food came out about fifteen minutes after ordering and I was very pleased that I went with the house smoked lake trout instead of the ham. The plate was very sexy and I kind of hesitated about how to dive right in.  I was wondering why I was provided a steak knife for an eggs benedict, but now I know, the bread itself is a bit thick and crusty and even with the knife was kind of hard to cut.  I over heard a table across from me stating the same thing.   The eggs were perfectly poached, trout was delicate, hollandaise very good and the greens added a contrast.   I will be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"Back again!  Today trying the pea and ham soup. This isn't split peas soup but rather a broth base with chunky like peas, carrots and ham. A bit if sweetness to it that I can't put my finger on what it is but the soup is very good. Had the side salad and fresh squeezed lemonade. I love the craft beer selections. Lagunitas, Victory, Oso, 3 sheeps, and Founders."}
{"text":"Breakfast was unique - I had French toast with cinnamon creme and diced apples and was blown away by the flavor and bread quality. Girlfriend had the eggs diablo and highly recommend trying for something different than you've ever tried for breakfast! Friendly staff and cool environment, will be returning!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed a lot of MSD's pastries and bread. They have been really good. I've only been to their space on willy street once but it was nice and clean. They have a nice patio area you can sit and enjoy your breakfast or coffee.  They also serve MSD at the coffee shop near my work. I've had several different danishes, the brioche, and the regular croissant. They danishes and brioche are really good. Every once in a while the croissant can be a bit over baked on top but still a good taste. My coworkers really enjoyed their blueberry scone yesterday saying it was better then most they've had before.  I would like to go back to their location on Willy St because I hear they opened a new space with more dessert like options that are suppose to be pretty epic."}
{"text":"Gimme them carbs.  Madison Sourdough makes glorious carbo-loading a possibility in all forms, and I'm not speaking strictly bread. (Though the breads here are mighty fine. I'd recommend the Sourdough....)  I adore the potato hash of yukon gold potatoes, onion, butternut squash and brussel sprouts, roasted beets, duck fat, and over easy eggs. Did I say duck fat? Yes, that just happened.   The shop itself is so inviting and is the kind of place you'd want to chill at for hours just sippin over a cup of tea or gnawing on a rustic baguette. Whatever tickles your fancy.   Personally, I'd go with the bread."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from a spa trip. It was a saturday morning so it was really busy. It was sort of disorganized and there was a long line for 1 register- the other register (closest) to the door was for coffee or pastries only. It did not work well- the line literally did not move for ordering breakfast and sandwich things. I guess I would say they should open up both registers to ordering everything especially since the register for coffee/ pastry was empty and many employees were just standing around.  Anyhow- once I got through the line (after 20 minutes) I ordered a coffee, morning bun and a turkey sandwich. I loved the morning bun. I thought I would just eat a few bites, but devoured the whole thing before my sandwich came. My sandwich was delicious. It could use a bit more turkey, but the flavor was great! I love bakeries and next time I go back I'll buy some bread. It all looked delicious and there is nothing I love more than great bread!"}
{"text":"yay, I finally got to try this place. So happy. My girl friends had a variety of meals. One had egg benedict, one had beet sandwich and the other had croissant sandwich. Only the one with beet sandwich didn't feel satisfied with her  food, the rest loved their choice.  I initially ordered some meatball (was craving for it), but then I learned that it was mixed of beef, lamb and cow so I cancelled out my order.  So, I was having a piece of CARRE Vanila and A chocolate croissant.  And I know I will be back for their CARRE VANILA. It's scrumptious. You should try it too! Madison Sourdough, you'll be on the list. You will!"}
{"text":"Nice experience and good food! Order the butter croissant breakfast sandwich and egg Benedict as well as three different desserts: vanilla macaroons, chocolate cake and cream puff.  Two entrees are delicious. I love both of them!!!  The desserts are not as good as I heard from other friends(excellent, extreme good and so on ) Macaroons is a little dry and the cream on chocolate cake is not very fresh (over night feeling)...Maybe I have too high expect. Even though, they are still yummy and not too sweet as normal American desserts, which I like.  In a word, it is a nice brunch experience. I will go there again to try more options!!"}
{"text":"Food is good there. Some if it is really fantastic. The diablo eggs are great. BLT is outstanding. Bread is also very good, but check to make sure it is cooked through. One time I good a loaf of bread that was not cooked through - disappointing."}
{"text":"Had some delicious cold brew coffee, potato hash, and eggs benedict. The pastry I had was a bit overdone and really tough to bite into but everything else was amazing. Great customer service too! Lots of unique options and flavors to choose from. I'm visiting from GA and this was my first time here but I hope to eat here again before I leave Madison!"}
{"text":"If your boyfriend spent last year in France and yearns for parisan delights, you can definitely impress him with a fresh baguette and fruit tart from MSCO and neighboring Patisserie. And since you're transporting him places, watch carefully as the first bite into the Beet Reuben sandwich takes him back to his childhood home where his mama made him casseroles. And if you're not fully transported yet, enjoy the view of the Madison flurries (in April) through MSCOs beautiful open windows right off of Willy, and find yourself entrapped in a romantic little snow globe where you sip coffee, eat macaroons, gossip about your friends' recent breakups, and write Yelp reviews.  Helpful Notes: Star Anise is definitely not a fruit. A wedding tasting was definitely happening on site... Just sayin."}
{"text":"As always, the baked goods are wonderful. This is the first time I have eaten here (rather than grabbed bread or treats to go), and the breakfast sandwich, with simple, vinaigrette-dressed greens on the side is delicious!   And the two rooms provide plenty of seating, and even a comfy 70's vintage couch which makes a comfy knitting place.  Bathroom (women's) is clean, too. (big thumbs up on that one)  Oh! And I nearly forgot...! Free WiFi! :-)"}
{"text":"Went to Madison Sourdough for lunch today. I had the best sandwich in a long time! Excellent combination of meatloaf, blue cheese, and pickled onions.... Every bite was delightful! The menu at this restaurant is wonderful, I have a very hard time deciding on what to order because everything on the menu sounds yummy! Go for breakfast or lunch, it's a win, win for either meal!"}
