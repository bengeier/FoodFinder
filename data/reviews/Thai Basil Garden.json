{"text":"Good size portion for the cost.   Flavours not the greatest and curry sauce quite watery.  The green curry was very minty green. Wings were quite good. Probably wouldn't come here again.   The interior looks tropical but dated.  Not a romantic place for a date."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials menu is great. They have a great collection of dishes with soup/salad/spring rolls appetizers for less than $10. Had the Thai fried noodles and really enjoyed it.  Not sure this is a Thai restaurant to bring the girlfriend but lunch is great and I think takeout will be good too."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me. Not only do they have amazing food, the quantity is great. I really like their home made noodles, as well as their coconut soup. The soup is usually very fresh with the vegetables being fresh and not soggy. You really cannot beat the food for that price. They could improve on a better staff. I have no problem with a family ran operation unless it hinders my experience. Hire some young servers and you will see a huge difference."}
{"text":"I always order from here, they're listed on JustEat and I find them one of the best Chinese/ Thai delivery places in the North York area.   The pad thai is my least favourite dish here- even though it's usually my favourite. The chicken dishes are always really good though- definitely try the spicy peanut chicken...verrry GOOD. General Tso is also friend goodness- it's not gourmet but its cheap-ish, good and convenient"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.    Atmosphere is consistent with a strip mall.   Food was good, not great.  Felt more of a Chinese place that served Thai.   For the price, lunch special was worth it.  Choice of app plus large portion entree.    Hong Kong noodles had great flavor but only offered with chicken for lunch.    The Penang curry was interesting because of the added cream.  Not too spicy for a one pepper rating.    Thai spicy noodles also rated at one pepper, but caused a little sweat.   Didn't care for the thin noodles."}
{"text":"Cheap. Green curry is not so good. It is really green, liked they used dye. Chicken is like rubber and broccoli was not fresh. Disappointed I really wanted curry for lunch."}
{"text":"Basil eggplant was great, though the pad thai was oddly sweet and not very good. The green thai curry made up for it. Decent quick takeout with good service, and about right for the price."}
{"text":"Good value at reasonable prices. It's a Chinese run Thai restaurant with Chinese dishes. So, you have to have the right expectations (not authentic Thai). We were stuck in traffic and decided to take a break for dinner. The plate portion was huge and no MSG. We asked for less salt and less oil. They accommodated which is always great!!!  We had the fried glass noodles, pineapple fried rice and curry beef panang. All were good. The curry looked strange but was surprisingly good. Not necessarily an authentic panang taste - but tasty nonetheless.  A very solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years now and I have never been disappointed. The service is friendly and the food is fantastic. My go-to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's been nearly a year since I started eating here and I feel like I need to give this restaurant an extra star now. I come here at least 1 or 2 times a week because it's clean, fast, it has a great selection of items to choose from the lunch specials and it is definitely a good deal. If you work in the area then this is a lunch destination for sure"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by Thai sculptures, bamboo poles, fake greenery and blinking Christmas lights for decor. Oh well, I'm here for the food.   Menu is extensive, but sadly no Thai iced tea. Waitress gave us fried wanton strips with a sweet sauce as a freebie appetizer. Food came out quick. Split a Shrimp with Lobster sauce and Szechuan Fried rice with hubby. The rice was flavorful and had tons of large juicy shrimp and tender chicken. The Shrimp with lobster sauce was very dark (looked liked they seasoned it with soy sauce), not authentic but tasty with lots of sauce to pour over the rice.   Ordered the fried banana with coconut ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce as an afterthought . Oh my! I've died and gone to heaven!! Banana was still warm and it was naturally sweet. Coconut ice cream had actual pieces of coconut inside, it paired perfectly with the fried banana.  Waitress was friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back to try other menu items. You know how with typical Chinese food you're starving 2 hours after you've eaten? Well that doesn't happen with the food here, maybe it was the fried banana desert that did it.   They do have a lunch menu available during the week from 11-3 which comes with a spring roll,  salad or hot and sour soup.   You can exchange brown rice for $1extra  They do deliver but charge $1.75. Min order of $20"}
{"text":"OK, before you show up here, you need to have the right expectations. First and foremost, this is by no means an authentic Thai restaurant--not even close. Second, it doesn't exactly deliver a refined ambience, probably not some place you'd take a girl on a date (but on the other hand, if she's cool with it, she's probably a keeper). If you're good with that, then you should be fine with this place.  The menu is fairly large with a number of Thai and Chinese options. After all, it IS a Chinese-run place. And on that note, you're probably better off ordering the Chinese dishes than the Thai dishes. For example, most of the Chinese stir-fry dishes are actually quite good and comparable to what you'd get at any Chinese place like Congee Wong. The prices are also very reasonable. Do not bother with the pad thai unless you are ok with a very sweet pad thai. One of my companions told me not to bother with the red curry; the green curry, on the other hand, is actually quite good and flavourful. The fried rice is ok. I also was not a fan of any of the sweet and sour-themed dishes (usually labeled as a \"tamarind\" dish on the menu).  In other words, the menu can be kind of hit or miss. As long as you keep in mind that this is not meant to be an authentic Thai restaurant and order accordingly, you'll be fine, and you'll find a large number of rather tasty and affordable options. I would give this place 3.5/5, but I am rounding up because the service is terrific. The employees are not trained to deliver a fine-dining experience, but they are courteous and friendly, and are mindful enough to alert you about some aspects of the menu so that you aren't caught off guard by what you order. The whole place has a family-run feel to it, and they seem like a good bunch of peeps, so kudos to them."}
{"text":"I had my heart set on falafel for lunch but my coworkers overruled me and we headed out for Thai. I was fully prepared to sulk and complain, but the staff were too friendly for that. I ordered the red curry lunch special for only $6.95 - it comes with a salad and rice. This place seems pretty popular and it's really clean and bright.   I can't speak for my fellow diners but everyone seemed to enjoy their order and the portions were generous but not ridiculous. I was surprised that they charged me $1.50 for green tea, since that's usually complimentary, no? Service was fast and the food was good, although I would have liked more fresh veg in my curry. They used canned pineapple and bamboo shoots.   I never go out of my way for Thai food but this place wasn't bad. I would go here again if I was with someone who specifically wanted Thai."}
{"text":"Thai basil is a place where you go for a quick lunch bite! I highly recommend their chicken dishes, and their noodle dishes during their lunch hour. It comes with a choice of spring rolls, and/or soup. You can sub you rice portion for fried rice for roughly $1. Their hot chilli oil is something you definitely need to add to your meal to give it a little extra kick.   Though this place is not ideal to be a real big foodie critic, it's always been a go to place for a quick bite, and a decent amount of food. Very filling! I couldn't even finish my entire meal! Yum."}
{"text":"despite this place is in front of mandarian . i might be crazy but i would chose this place over a buffet. the portions are good,with the price, what i ate that day was amazing that i order takeout for dinner.  i took my boss there for a nice dinner, and after that day i got a high position. i don't know what to say it must had been luck, or  he was impress by me.  but the food was really good  who ever goes here spring roll is amazing, and also get the green curry chicken"}
{"text":"Our friends like thai food so we found ourselves at this cute little establishment a few weeks ago. It is located in a strip mall in a more industrial part of town so not the nicest setting, but it has a roomy private (free) parking lot. We had lunch and all the dishes were tasty. The portions were good sized and reasonably priced. The decor looks like it was bought from the tropical section of Party Packagers but the place is clean and the service was very good. I would recommend this restaurant if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Food was ok but pad Thai was too too sweet. Didn't like it at all. Green curry was good-ish but too brightly coloured!! LOL looked almost neon green! I Liked the chips they gave...it was since touch. Price - reasonable."}
