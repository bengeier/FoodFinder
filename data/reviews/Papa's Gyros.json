{"text":"This place was my first experience with Greek food and I loved it... I can't imagine my life without gyros now lol. Its kinda small but the food definitely makes up for it and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"The dolma (stuffed grape leaves) was fantastic. The gyros not so much the meat wasn't all that great and the tzatziki sauce had an unusual favor. My friend says the chicken gyro was amazing. All in all I I will try them again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and oh my goodness it was soooo good for the lemon chicken and the shawirma and wow amazing flavor. Also got the 2 for 1.50 baklava which was awesome for my desert. Will be ordering from again."}
{"text":"Honestly, great place to eat. I get the gyro plate and it's the greatest thing ever! Don't forget the extra garlic sauce! Would recommend to all my friends"}
{"text":"The best, an all-time family favorite! The lentil soup is very good. I go with the mixed grill and a vegetarian plate because everything here is so delicious I like to eat it all. The service is exceptional and the place is well kept. This is one of the best places in the valley!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for the last 2-3 years and have never been disappointed, anything I and my family have tried has been very good and trust me we have tried at least 10 different items on the menu if not more, including desserts like baklava, Mmmmm!! delicious. The family are nice people and they have good service, It's not a big location of course but remember that the little spots usually have the best foods and not expensive at all, so when your on a budget you can still bring your family to eat and not spend a lot at this place and they serve a good amount of food for the price you're paying, sometimes I take leftovers home cause I couldn't finish it and trust me I love food and I can eat, lol. I would recommend this place to anyone, I even got my parents and sibling's coming back to it, try it, I don't think you will be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. 
First of all the food took forever- even though my bf and I were the only ones there. They have only 1 gyro on the menu. C'mon now, every greek restaurant should have more than 1 type of gyro. My bf had the gyro and thought it wasn't bad, despite the grease that poured out the bottom of his gyro when he held it up. However, when I order a gyro with beef only (no lamb), they didn't have it. They also didn't have the beef sandwich. When I ordered the Italian sandwich I was in horror when it came out. It looked like soggy roast beef (that surprisingly tasted very dry due to overcooking) served in an old hot dog bun. No joke, the bread was an over-microwaved hot dog bun that was too hard to tear apart, nonetheless bite through it. It tasted as bad as it looked and I resorted to eating only my fries (which were overcooked and hard. I think they re-cooked a batch that had been sitting out since lunch three hours before we came in). Who messes up fries?!? 
This was a horrid eating experience that left me going straight to Mickey-D's for something more reliable. Save your money, people."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro.

THE GOOD:
1. Well spiced gyro meats, but a tad too greasy for my tastes. You also get a reasonable portion, which is always appreciated.
2. The pita bread was rather tasty as well. Slightly chewy, though.
3. Not too expensive.
4. Friendly owners.

THE BAD:
1. A little piece of tomato and a few paper-thin pieces of onions. If you love onions in your gyro, ask for some extra onions on the side.
2. Again, it's a bit greasy. Even for a gyro.

THE SO-SO:
1. The tzatziki isn't that flavorful, but I enjoy a definite garlicky presence to my tzatzik'. It was decent, but afterwards I wasn't lapping up every last bit from the little plastic container like a hungry dog.

All in all, I'll probably return if I'm in the area and crave a gyro."}
{"text":"I had the combination kabob plate. We also had the grape leaves appetizer, gyros, and lamb kabob plate. All the food was authentic and delicious! The service was outstanding, and the atmosphere is wonderful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The pita was so hot, I had to wait a minute to eat it.  I had a greek salad and it was good, no complaints.  A colleague stated it was the best gyro she had ever had.  The service was wonderful too!  This is definitely worth it!  The prices aren't bad too!"}
{"text":"Great food great service...doma...mmm good. Bummed  to see the place didn't have many people get for lunch. The last was kind and served us our drinks. Good cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The prices and serving sizes are amazing! Aside from that, the food is COMPLETELY authentic and the family who runs the restaurant are all super friendly. I highly recommend this place, I absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good gyros combos. Service is nice also. Nice place for lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always get the greek salad. Mom and pop place, and if ur there at the right time the owners wife will be the one at the counter."}
{"text":"This was a great discovery.  My friend and I were in the area and saw this plaza with italian, chinese & greek options.  (There was also Mexican directly across the street).  We pulled in and decided that greek was the most appealing option at this plaza.  
Since I'm doing my best to lessen my red meat intake, I have been eating mostly chicken lately.  I scanned the menu for something different.  Yay.  They have a vegetarian section...and that's where I first discovered what Tabsy is.  They do their own spin, which is without chickpeas, but tasty nonetheless.  Part of the missing star is because they advertise it as spicy, or at least containing chilis, which were not detectable when first served.  I basically just had to ask for chili sauce. 
I did research on this dish when I arrived home (thats how I found the persian and moroccan recipes that call for chickpeas to be included).  I'm neutral on chickpeas, so I wasn't really disappointed after reading that.  It didn't change the fact that I really enjoyed this \"eggplant stew\".  I would definitely come back, I would definitely order it again.
So the main reason I took a whole star away had mostly to do with the fact that when my friend and I walked in, there was no one to greet or seat us, yet there were 3 separate identifiable voices in the back.  A man eventually stepped forward, said hello and greeted us.  The lady who served us was on top of our drink refills.  I can't complain too much, as it had a real mom n pop feel, so that was just part of it...."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, and the warmest, fluffiest pita ever. The hummus was more on the lemony side, which was refreshing, though I prefer it more garlicky. The italian beef was tasty, but the bread could not withstand the juice, and it got gooey.

The interior could use some help, and our server seemed a bit strung out. But the the service was attentive and quick. The prices are really fair as well."}
{"text":"This was a great gyro shop, clean and quick to serve, price seemed higher then others until I got the food, good amount for the dollar. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Does not honor coupons Entertainment book  be warned. Food is good but I hate it when they don't honor there own coupons."}
{"text":"Very accommodating family owned business... Not sure they completely understood everything we said but nevertheless the food was amazing... And didn't cost me an arm and leg... I had their gyro and it was awesome... The artwork around the small dining area was enough to be oooohhhed and aaaaawwwwed at but then the food came and we were very pleased... I will definitely return again..."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way back to my office. Found it on yelp and figured \"what the heck\". So I stooped in, pretty slow just one table was seated. I wanted a take out. The waitress who took my order was a bit outta it or just shy. 

I got a chicken gyro, fries, and a coke. All for under $7. It was HUGE, I ate half the fries, half the gyro, and half the soda. Which is probably good for my heart and overall well being. Nonetheless it's a pretty decent little spot."}
{"text":"Didn't taste bad per say, but didn't meet my expectations for Greek food. Black olives out of a can instead of kalamata olives. I can tell the feta cheese is store bought crumbles instead of fresh cut. Ultimately can taste and tell the difference. Go to pita kitchen in Avondale soooo worth it."}
{"text":"A small mom and pop Greek joint, with excellent food, which is made to order, and excellent prices. A great place for lunch that I have been going to for several years. It is frequented by the local ambulance crews in the area because it is fast and cheap. The staff is friendly, and quick to remember you if you come in more than once. The gyros are great, with hot, fresh fries on the side. The falafel is also good, though they do not always have it. I will continue eating here for a long time to come, and hope you come try it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It was my first time there. Walked in didnt see anyone in the counter everyone was in rhe dining room, a little ackward. One lady was nice and showed ne to the menu, dudnt know if to order in coubmnter ir sit down and order. The place was pretty dead but good for me it meant less wait. I got a kifta and schwarma combo(not on their menu but i ask if it could be dine and the nice lady agreed,usually my favorites). Gyros usually are never bad but i wanted to try thivtype of restaurants other favorites. 1. Their rice was bland dont think it was Jazmine rice and super soft i usually like a little crisp 2. Meat schwarma was also bland and kn the sweet side which was weird, seemed nore boiled than grilled. 3. Beef kifta was good but not something i would order again. 3. Their BAKLAVA kind of sweetened the dissapointment, it was very tasty and you get two pieces for $1.50 which was pretty nice. Its a small local place  and came with open mind but just not what i expected. :-( dont get me wrong i will come back for the Gyro and hopefully uts good. I think if you dine you get lentil soup, but i didnt get it since i got it to go. Gyro sandwich combo $6.95 and i posted some pics of the menu! You are welcome..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Me and my boyfriend came here because it was close.. great choice we made! We've been coming here ever since! We usually get the gyro sandwiches with extra meat and boy do they pile it on! Their hummus I'd to die for as well! They are always super nice and love that they deliver!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their gyros! They seriously have the most flavorful gyro meat I've ever had. Service is a tad slow but they are all very friendly. Lunch specials under $10."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Freshly made, very high quality! I most certainly recommend them. The gyros are delicious and the homemade fries remind me of my granddad's. The staff is friendly and very attentive! A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is across the street form where I work and is super convenient I love all their food, everything I have tried is excellent. The Gyro's and hummus, the Dolmas. This is a great little Greek restaurant in the heart of Glendale. The staff is super friendly and it does not take long for your food to get ready. I love this place."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! The Baba ghanouj is excellent you can taste the eggplant. The gyro meat delicious the Kebab delicious but the best, if you like it you've got to get the kibbeh. What I liked about it is it's authentic this is not them trying to make it to appeal to everyone. This is the real deal. Go and eat there it's authentic. The only Downer is the place itself. It's closer to being a pizza shop. This is the perfect spot for Diners Drive-Ins and Dives"}
{"text":"Papa Gyros is a good spot to eat they have different flavors and their food is different from the normal fast food restaurants If your looking for a place wherr you don't want to eat a burger or fries and a place that has amazing food this is the spot"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious, the Greek salad, gyros, baklava chicken shawirma, it's all good!  One of the times we ate here we sat next to two guys who were enjoying their food so much, they called another friend down to eat with them.  Yup it's that good.   It's located in a shady looking strip mall and the inside isn't much to talk about but the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great the kids even ate it. I have a vegan teenager so its great to have options for her too. Love it and we will def be back for more."}
{"text":"I saw this place out of the corner of my eye on the way somewhere else a couple of weeks ago.  The reviews were old but positive.  I got there early for the lunch crowd and by the time I left almost 1/2 the tables were occupied.  

I had a lunch special gyro with fries ($7.99 including soda).  Very good.  haven't had a gyro in 15+ plus years so didn't have anything to compare it to.  The fries were hot, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  The two women running the place pleasant and the service was good.

It turns out I became one of those folks who can't be taken anywhere, even by myself.  I am paying attention to my gyro and keeping it together not noticing the paper wrapper was acting as a funnel to spray the juices from the meat and vegetables all over the front of me and my lap.  By the time I realized what was happening I was covered!  :-)"}
{"text":"hands down best gyro i have ever had!  stuffed full of meat absolute perfection!  Recommend them to everyone without hesistation!"}
{"text":"So first time for me to try their food and it was delicious! They do not skimp on the meat in the gyro. It was very full. The meat itself was of good quality and quite tasty. Their prices are very good. The only thing I was sad about was that I wanted to try the baklava but they were out. No worries, I will grab it next time."}
{"text":"I loved the gyro combo. One of the best gyros I have had in a while. You will not be disappointed if you go here. Also really friendly service and good sized portions"}
{"text":"I recently moved from Michigan, and I am looking for Arabic food of the quality that I was accustomed to in Dearborn.   This restaurant was not it.  
     I ordered a fattoush salad, and I was not impressed.  The pita chips were great.  They were warm and crispy.  The dressing and seasoning wasn't right, it was more like an Italian vinaigrette.  The salad was simple: onions, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. I also ordered a baba ganoush sandwich.  It was okay, but still not the taste I was looking for.
     Now, although the food was just decent, I must say that the service was excellent. The woman noticed that I ordered a vegetarian sandwich, so when I ordered a garlic sauce to dip my pita in, she took extra care to bring me a vegetarian version.  I am not a vegetarian, but I appreciate that she took the time to do that for me.  She said that her regular version of the garlic sauce includes egg.
     I am also a fan of the fact that they sell bread and Arabic sweets.  It is close to home if I should get that craving.  They do not make their own bread or sweets, but it is still nice to know where I can find such a thing in Arizona."}
{"text":"Pita was undercooked and doughy. Chicken gyro was bland. rice had no flavor. Got a combo and the picture showed a large cup when I finally got the cup it was a kids water cup. Ended up throwing it away and getting Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Our office recently moved to the Glendale area and this place is a hidden gem!!!  The owners and staff are super nice.  We let them know it was out first time in and we were able to sample some extremely awesome split pea soup.  Nothing like I have ever tasted. :)

I ordered the Gyro lunch special... Holy cow it was sooooo good!!!  The French fries are cut and made fresh, which makes the meal even better.  No ketchup needed on those babies!!!

I also had a greek side salad.  They made it special and charges a little more, but, again it was well worth it.  The dressing was superb!

The grape leaves were amazing as well.  Very good blend of flavor.  So different from what I have had in the past as well, but a pleasant surprise all the way around.

This will be a regular place for myself and co-workers!  We had a fabulous lunch today!

I usually comment on the bathrooms when I do a review, but did not enter one today...  hopefully its not disappointing. lol

Thanks for reading......."}
{"text":"Best hummus in the west valley. My husband got the beef shwarma which is well priced and a big helping, I got the chicken mshikla which was $10 but OMG it was so good and I took home and entire to go container full. Pure bread great- they grill it right before they serve it to you and free deliscious lentil soup no matter what as an appetizer. Seriously, go here."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they delivery. I'v eaten here before and it is such a welcoming environment but not lately since I worked to far from their location. Since I've moved to a different office I realized that my office is now on the other side of their cut off for delivery but the gentleman taking my call said they would deliver. This is the reason I gave them 5 stars. Great customer service and friendly staff went the extra mile to deliver. I immediately placed my order for their Gyro lunch special OMG It is so good and by the way they delivered it pretty quick. Thanks again Papa's Gyros for a satisfying and delicious lunch. I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I noticed this place had delivery on grub hub  so I decided to give it a try. When I hit my food I was disappointed that I didn't get my yogurt drink, no big deal, but then as I opened the food boxes I noticed a nasty rotting smell. At first I thought it was just me but as I ate I noticed it was the rice that had gone bad. I had no choice but to dump all the rice before I puked which sucks because I always look forward to the rice from these places. The rest of the food was fair to poor. The hummus had a pool of oil up top, the falafel and chicken lacked flavor and if you would have told me the lamb was deer I would have believed you. I think I'll look elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG fan of Greek / Mediterranean food. My step dad suggested this place because he knew I love gyros and lamb. He has only been to this place once and said they cut their lamb meat kind of thick, which I preferred. When we got there it was empty and no one greeted us. I had to walk to the counter to grab a menu and sit. Finally a guy showed up at the register and I proceeded to order a gyro plate. He said they thinly slice the lamb instead of thick cuts. Sad but okay. Ordered a side of fries as well. Didn't really like it, too oily and salty.  The meat is okay. I really like the lamb to have a strong taste and smell. That's what differs it from other meats but this one was only a hint of lamb taste/smell. They didn't put any onion in, which surprised me. The rice was alright as well. I liked the salad but even that was just basic lettuce and tomato. Overall, it was okay. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"GrubHub fail. 1.5 hours of my life I can't get back. Mad wife. Don't/won't/can't answer the phone.  Waste of time."}
{"text":"So glad we found you guys! Your food is nothing short of amazing and the delivery is always super fast! There's a reason we've been ordering from you twice a week! I recommend Papa's to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food was okay; big portions for a decent price. I ordered three gyros sandwiches and they were all very filling. Although the gyros meat was good, the pitas were squishy.

The place is really dirty, though. It looked like the floor hadn't been swept in a long time and when I looked back into the kitchen I saw dirty towels and cleaning bottles around food areas. So my confidence in food safety isn't high."}
