{"text":"I love the layout of the miniature golf course however you cannot play bank shots because all of the holes are bordered in brick if you try to bank anything it hits the corner of a brick which makes the ball bounce anywhere and that just makes the game no fun to me because you can't play your banks property"}
{"text":"Cool Springs is newly renovated and has become a great place to hang out. There's now a giant indoor sports complex, mini golf, putting green, multilevel driving range, ice cream shop and restaurant! There is tons for the family to do plus the restaurant has really good food. There is outdoor seating and fire pits which create the perfect atmosphere to relax and enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"Thought the mini golf would be remodeled with the new owners ... Well new turf and a few rocks is all that has changed since the 80's.... Hitting a bucket of balls and don't have your own club anywhere else loans you one no questions asked  cool springs wants a credit card or 30 dollar deposit for the same banged up clubs they had 15 years ago and if you ding it you don't get your deposit back. Ice cream nope not open on a Friday evening at 7 pm. Prices so so cheaper at other ranges ... Food I haven't personally tried but have been told that they had a military and retired military discount but do not give it anymore .... The guy in the mini golf/ driving range hut is a club Nazi......."}
{"text":"Cool springs is a beautiful complex and everything looks good and renovated. The mini golf course is however boring. There is no fun obstacles to it, only rocks, bumby turf and little ramps. Compared to other mini golf courses, it's just very bland. The man running the center where you pay for mini golf and get the clubs and balls was very unfriendly and seemed annoyed we were coming when we did. At the end of our game, we went back in to return our clubs and the balls and we wanted to buy a drink.....the guy told us he already closed down the registers. I don't think that was very good business, especially when we weren't even the last people to be playing, there were still people behind us. I would however come back to Cool Springs, it's something to do, close to home and late at night."}
{"text":"Cool Springs was a great place for mini golf 20+ years ago. They sacrificed quality and thrill of the game for \"looks\". Each hole is outlined in bricks so bank shots are worthless. There are finishing touches missing on tunnels so any efforts for skill shots are pointless and your ball can get stuck under boulders. They might be trying to pass off a polished look but there's still so much lacking here."}
{"text":"We attended a school fundraiser there.  The fundraiser itself was very nice however the food had a lot to be disired.   The chicken was terrible.  Too dry.  When an elderly man fell there seemed to be no one able to help him to his car.   An employees directed him to someone that would help him but kept doing whatever he was doing.   The bathrooms could have been taken care of better as well."}
{"text":"The facility is huge but with that the prices are high. The mini golf was $9 For a subpar course. It has no flow, there's no real challenge in deflecting the ball to get around things. Under rocks and hit a high carpet which throws the ball completely out of whack. The design compared to a lot of courses is bad. 
My wife became bored with the course and essentially gave up. 
Save your money and golf elsewhere, it's NOT worth $9."}
{"text":"Really love the driving range, when you go inside its hard to find anything and the staff is more than unhelpful. The staff is rude and slow. Never tried the food yet, plan to take the food to go when I do try the food. The driving range is really nice, the construction is a bit annoying. Looking forward to winter to see how the range is. They have two levels for the driving range. That is the only thing I recommend is the range."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to golf.  Their food is delicious but their drinks are overpriced and weak.  Staff is mediocre at best.  Live music selections are absolutely terrible.  I've left on multiple occasions because the musicians are always so loud and offensive that I can't hear my boyfriend talking right next to me.  Last Saturday there was a guy playing who ruined our evening as he picked songs so depressing it ruined the happy mood of our Saturday date night. I keep trying to give this place a chance but every time I leave wondering why I ever went back."}
{"text":"I came here for my little cousins birthday party this past Saturday. This was my first time coming to Cool Springs since they renovated, so I was excited to see what changes were made. Honestly, I didn't remember much from how it was before, besides the area outside were the shooting range is. Considering it is January and was freezing when I went, I did not check out the new shooting range other than observing it from a window on the inside. 

The inside of Cool Springs looks amazing. The bar is gorgeous and the view is beautiful- it overlooks the golf course. It's cozy- almost like a ski lodge, with the fireplace and the darker colors. I didn't have a chance to check out their menu , but I heard their wings are pretty good and I definitely plan on going back to try some food. 

Their party room was very odd. It was in a room that also overlooked the golf area , so the view was green and pretty. There weren't actual walls though- there were like thick tent walls if that makes sense- allowing for air and cold to come through the cracks. I'm not sure if this is something that they are still working on or if that's the way the room is. The ceiling was also very leaky (it was raining). A real big inconvenience at the party- my baby cousin kept getting leaked on.  

The buffet consisted of a salad, multiple types of pizza and some boneless wings. Everything that I ate was decent but nothing spectacular. Their tomato basil pizza had a garlic sauce and chunks of mozzarella cheese - it was really good.

Our service was also great- one waitress took care of our party and kept great track of what items needed to be refilled in the buffet as well as taking our dirty plates. She was awesome. 

The interactive golfing game in the basement was pretty cool- definitely cool that you can practice golf or just play for fun in the cold weather. 

Overall, it was an average experience. I would like to come back with better weather to see how the shooting range and mini golf is now and possibly to check out their menu for lunch."}
{"text":"Had it in my head that I wanted to stop in on my way home tonight after a trip north of town. Not really sure why as I knew it is kind of over priced from the 2 times I've stopped in with my mom and sisters in the last 2 years. Boy was this a mistake. 2 big issues tonight.

One, is that it was MUCH too dark at the table I was placed at. There was NO light at the tables surrounding the bar. I could tell there was light behind me and the bar was light up really well. I have no idea why that would be as you don't need lights to order drinks and to drink them. I've been in low light places before but never no light. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. There was no way I was able to read it without it. Irritating.

But the thing that really set me off is that when the waitress stopped by to give me my drink she asked if I needed more time. I said yes as I hadn't gotten a chance to look at the menu yet. But I asked if I would start off with a slice of chocolate cake. I was hungry and I figured I would start with that while deciding and waiting for my food. How hard could that be? How long could it possibly take to get a slice of cake anyhow? Well, I have no idea. I got so tired of waiting for something so simple as a slice of cake that I just got up and walked out. Piss poor service and a super long wait for something that should have ZERO wait cost you a meal and dessert and me ever returning."}
{"text":"Best driving range in all of Pittsburgh. Everything's newly renovated. Highly recommended for the year-round golfer looking to keep his or her game sharp.  Beautiful all NEW facility, with full restaurant and bar overseeing the deck and two tier driving range."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I haven't been to CS in years and we decided to check out the remodel by going mini-golfing on a nice summer night. I wish we could have picked a different course. 

The course is the same as I remember it was years ago. It's bland and boring. There are no fun obstacles. It's green, fake sand, green, fake sand, occasional rock and so on. Boring! Where is the fun?! We paid a ridiculous $8/person for a boring 18-hole course and had to wait for every hole because of slow golfers and parents who don't know how to tell their kids to hurry up. We also were very displeased by the amount of leaves all over the green. For $8, this should have been cleaned up. Get a leaf blower! Lastly, they tore down most of the trees that separate the road from the course. It was better before because you felt comfortable and cozy. 

Save your money and head out a little farther to Sunset Golf out in South Park. It's cheaper, way more fun and they have over 18 holes."}
{"text":"I rarely give anything five stars.  That being said. .. they've done some fabulous renovations here!  The driving range is two levels with credit card self serve for bucket fills or cash at the small pro shop.     The clubhouse is spacious with outdoor seating overlooking the driving range.   There is a bar & seating on the lower level as well.   

The menu is basic but delicious & well prepared.  The staff is friendly & welcoming."}
{"text":"While still under construction, the golf related facilities at Cool Springs Sports Complex are up and running. CSSC features a very nice two-tiered driving range that wraps around and above the on-site dining facility, Fairway Grille. Also available is an 18-hole miniature golf course, and a short-game practice area with putting greens.

The day I visited the facility, it was hot, muggy, and rainy, but I was able to get a spot in one of the covered bays of the driving range. ($12) for a little over 100 range balls. The range itself is fully turfed with light green \"greens\" complete with distance coordinated flags, dark green turf everywhere else and a central pond with a fountain. 

The range overall is aesthetically pleasing and perfectly suitable for getting in some practice strokes. When I have a chance to explore the mini golf course and other practice facilities, I may adjust my rating accordingly, but with what appears to be a void in driving ranges in the Pittsburgh area, you could do a whole lot worse than CSSC.

According to the website, additional indoor multi-sport complexes should be complete by the end of the year."}
{"text":"This is a really nice sports complex that has a full size field, a café, and a dance studio inside.  The parking is ample and its always been clean.  I have been here only 2 times for football camps, but have felt that it's a really nice place for recreational activities. The only problem is, there aren't very many places for spectators.  There are a few bleachers, but they are very small.  There are tables near the café, but those are for café patrons only."}
{"text":"Just opened and still some work to be done.  The ball dispensers take credit cards.  Unfortunately, would not read either of my cards.  A friend had to buy for me after trying 4 machines.   If you hit from the upper deck, you get a little more distance...  

Much of the range is artificial turf with 4 greens to hit to and a pond with a fountain that is about 130 yards away.  Some of the grass area behind and to the slicers delight is still dirt so the sign on the ball dispenser said NO DRIVERS.  The tees were nice but did not have any tees.

I thought the prices were a little high for a bucket of balls..34 balls for $8, 68 balls for $12 and 102 balls for $15.  The ramps to the tee areas were narrow if you have a golf bag and someone is coming from the other direction, but not a real problem.

The miniature golf course was open and looked to be renovated.  Claiming to be the longest miniature golf course east of the Mississippi.   

There was a small pro shop and two indoor areas for simulation and golf lessons.  A small snack bar is available in that area,  but it was closed at the time or our visit.
Golf lessons anyone?

Was talking to a employee who said, an outdoor field, a field house and dek hockey are in the plans but will not be ready until next year."}
{"text":"My son and I came to play mini golf here. I had seen that they had recently done some renovations and I wanted to come check it out. Unfortunately I paid nine dollars for my son and I to play the most boring miniature golf course ever. This course is completely unimaginative and dull from the very start. My son loves to play miniature golf and by the 11th hole he was already asking if we could go home. I was completely underwhelmed. Save your money and go to Sunset golf in South Park. Much better course."}
{"text":"Just renovated and they need to get a refund from their architect. From the parking lot when you walk toward the front doors, its the bar and lounge not the driving range---need a sign please. Walk around the side through two glass doors and you have a choice, either the elevator or a dimly lit stairwell. Took the elevator. Leaving the elevator you are now in a narrow lobby with a bag stand. Walk through two more sets of glass doors to the pro shop. Ask for a large bucket and immediately get the upsell pitch that for $200 I can get a 20% discount. Dude, I asked for a bucket not an investment!! Large bucket is $15. A little steep I thought but hey, I'll try it. Back through the two sets of glass doors to my bag to the outside to find no that means zero benches to sit on and no tees!! No drivers allowed.....no drivers allowed at a driving range. Everyone who was duped into thinking this was a driving range after paying a premium price was shaking their head. Well they got one bucket of balls out of me, BUT NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Came here during vacation for a fun game of mini golf. We were not disappointmented. My husband, who golfs regularly, enjoys mini gold as do I. Who doesn't? Often times we end up going to mini golf locations with cheesy props and themes. Granted sometimes these are fun to play in, but it is also nice to have and adult-oriented mini golf location. Well, this was it! No goofy props, just gorgeously landscaped grounds with a calming atmosphere. There were plenty of benches available for us to sit and enjoy the scenery and take breaks. The grounds were immaculately kept and clean. We really enjoyed our mini golf match and really wish we had a place like this in Maryland."}
