{"text":"The only reason I am giving them one star is because it's the minimum amount of stars that can be given.     Terrible experience tonight. Went to meet friends and waited 15 minutes while seated at the bar and our presence wasn't acknowledged . .When I walked over to the other side of the bar to find the bartender and waitress to ask if we could get served... the bartender looked up and said he was busy with a full bar and we would have to wait ... and the  waitress looked up and me and rudely said \"yeah\".    To add insult to injury a couple who just sat down were served immediately.  We waited 10 more minutes and left.   Won't be coming back.    For $14 a drink I would expect better service and not to be ignored and then rudely addressed."}
{"text":"Too loud by far. The music was distorted it was so loud and I had to scream all evening. Could not hear the person i came with. I'm exhausted today from this experience. And this is a speakeasy? I'll need a hearing aid after visiting this establishment because my hearing has been ruined. No amount of alcohol could make me comfortable here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. Not going to appeal to everybody as it is not your typical college town party bar. In fact it's the opposite. If that appeals to you then go check it out!"}
{"text":"Clever speakeasy concept with a great staff and a beautiful bar in which the owners spared no expense. Love it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome. Feels like you are in a NY City style speakeasy. Must try the old fashion and meat/cheese board. Bartenders look and dress the part of a speakeasy and provide great service."}
{"text":"Beautiful place and ambiance, except for the dam rude bartender, mid-age rounder faced dude serving it up to all...except us 3 ladies!  We were there on Dec. 2, celebrating our friend's 50th bday after a evening of a great dinner elsewhere, she advised the law firm in which she worked for recommended a great place for drinks and all things cool.  We walk in and are excited for what we see as a beautiful swanky deep place and a cool younger vibe.  There were a few olders like us (mind you we don't look 50 - we each are Hispanic).  I was directly in front of the mid age black rimmed eyeglasses bartender at the bar as a another patron graciously gave up his seat so that I could move in closer to the bar and make our request.  He is pouring up old fashions with no problem, serving and asking to the left and right of me who would like a drink, when they already had been there seated with drinks.  The mid age bartender continues to not make eye contact with me and ignores me for at least what seemed 10 minutes.  So we 3 ladies, continue to giggle and enjoy the beauty around us and just shrug our shoulders, like why taking so long and we all know it was busy.  A simply nod, or be right with you, would have been ideal!  And I know he saw that I was waiting there as it was obvious that the gentlemanly patron before moved so that I can request our drinks. So we make small talk with those next to each of us, until I had to freaking speak up as loud as I could (as great tunes were playing) could we get some drinks.  The rude bartender continues to avoid me until another wonderful younger happy feller bartender could only see that I had been standing there looking at them (he could have been a bar back).  He proceeds to tell the mid-age sour puss round rimmed eyeglass wearing bartender we are waiting.  So then he looks at me, never asks what can I get you, so I speak up as he finally acknowledges I am there!!  I then ask for famed cotton candy peppermint drink that we were told about as that is what our bday girl wanted to start off her bday celebration with.  He could not do them or they didn't make them anymore.  Okay, fair...then one of our girls wanted a Malibu rum and coke, simple enough - sour puss then says, no Malibu rum and continues to look annoyed with us.  Uggh, okay, we still are in the happy birthday mood, ask for other drinks and never again to be asked if we wanted another.  So needless to say, we wanted to stay a bit longer to enjoy the beauty and vibe, but our experience with the rudeness of this bartender just lacked our excited and happy vibe. I just couldn't believe with a wonderful progressive crowd to be overlooked and it was just so obvious.  I work for a mid-size law firm and was going to suggest to our office manager to look into this place for after xmas dinner drinks, but me thinks not!  I like to be fair, but when another an employee at a public service place is possibly having a bad night, don't put it out to the universe, especially to your patrons."}
{"text":"Smokers outside but way too loud inside to hear. They specialize in cocktails, but were out of the ingredients for the cocktail I ordered. No plans to return."}
{"text":"Our sweet waiter from downstairs led us through the backdoor to this little gem. We sat at the bar and were super impressed by the gin drinks and tiki options our bar tender created. The look of the place is very nice it reminds me of a New York bar with much more space. We will make this a hangout for sure."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Honor Amongst Thieves since before it had opened. I should have visited a lot earlier. The drinks were amazing and the knowledge of our bartender, Ryan, was fantastic. I had an amazing time and look forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Came here st. Party's day ... great drinks, vibe , great Dj .... can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. We went on a Saturday night and there was a DJ ... music was very loud to have a conversation without yelling but the drinks were delicious.  A bit smaller than expected but the drinks were delicious.... Hard to find seating so small groups would be best suited for this place."}
{"text":"Call before going here or they might be closed. I called around 9 pm and they said they would be open until 12. Arrived at about 10pm and they were closing down. I understand that if they aren't busy they would close early. But at least mention that to me on the phone. I'm sure it wasn't busy at 9 either and they could've mentioned the possibility of closing early. Very disappointing to have to drive all the way out there and then be turned away. If this happens to you go to Bevvy across the street (this location is much nicer than the one in old town). They will be open and they stick to their stated times.  If we ever get a chance to go here again maybe my review will change. But for now it gets 1 star for poor customer service."}
{"text":"I need to start with the fact that we are normal people, not hipsters, and not scottsdale brats. That being said, we are very impressed with this place. Walking into a trendy new business and seeing their dress code on the door is perfect, I  appreciate the business setting the tone from the start. The music is perfect, the ambiance  is dark and elegant and everything about the place is enjoyable. This place is what Bitter & Twisted aspires to be. Good on you Honor Amongst Thieves."}
{"text":"the location is great, decorations and vibe are cool   HOWEVER the bartenders could be so much better. Each request for service resulted in no eye contact and the feeling that we (4 people in my group) were bothering the 3 gentlemen behind the bar. Each of them told us to ask the other guy or just walked past when requesting 2nd drinks. Someone sitting next to our group was getting acknowledged/customer service and so we ultimately gave our order to her and she asked for the bartender to \"get her friends some drinks\" and they sent a waitress to take our order... confusing since we were sitting right there at the bar.  If they don't like working with people maybe don't work with people"}
{"text":"This is a cool looking bar to say the least. I liked the music  and the dark ambiance it has. Unfortunately I am disappointed that there isn't a dress code enforced, I felt like I was at Trader Joes and yet it was Friday night. And to make matters worse, it took 30 minutes to get the bartender's attention just to  (mind you we were sitting at the bar) pay the tab. Cool place, has potential but sadly lacks that it factor for a nightly weekend spot. Save yourself the bad service and go up the street to Merc Bar. The martinis are waaay better anyway."}
{"text":"Very hip and private setting upstairs! The venue is fantastic but the DJ music is over the top... the bartenders are true mixologist and do amazing drinks."}
{"text":"Really nice bar and drink menu, it was a very clean environment and well decorated. Was very gay friendly and nice people."}
{"text":"No sign. A back stair entrance. Dim and scented. Good bathrooms. The place felt like somewhere one might meet a vampire. Every kind of booze was represented. The drinks were tight. I had some Sartori whisky on a giant cube of ice and the wife had a Skyfall with vodka and egg whites. The place was busy but our server paid attention to us and gave us a minute of chat time. We were there for a before-dinner cocktail but it seems like the place gets packed by 11 or 12. My new favorite place when I am within a mile of 7th street and Missouri. And I want to meet a vampire."}
{"text":"Dark but not gloomy. Active but not too loud. Cool spot on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night. Real cool! The drinks are expensive. I believe they range from $12-$15 bucks. D.C., Brooklyn, NY prices but that's how the place feels. Definitely something new and different for Phoenix. I have friends that compare this place to Valley Bar. I think not. They're both different and equally unique in their own right.   I've only visited his place once but I don't believe there's live music and no food, drinks only I believe. I love the old school, sleek, leather seating. It cozy, comfy and romantic. I'd visit this place alone or with a date. I don't think it's a cool ladies night spot. I had the ole' fashioned. It was good but I've had better. Valley bar in fact. My friend ordered a drink with cotton candy, I don't remember the name and I didn't bother to try it. Not my cup of tea   Overall I'll definitely go back when I want to solo date night!!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times, drinks are good. Food is servicable. I do love the ambiance and overall feel of the bar."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday night and we were pleasantly surprised, it took a minute to find once we realized it was upstairs. You walk into the back of the bar to find a patio and extra tables, once inside the room is dark like a speakeasy. Kind of odd to mention but it smells really nice, reminds me of an Anthropologie candle. The bar is the focal point here and it's stocked with tons of spirits and liquors and lit in a way that looks super cool. My friend and I tried to different cocktails each and they were all good they have a good handle on specialty drinks and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is a unique place indeed, with great cocktails. We had the Paloma and One Night in Bangkok. Both excellent drinks! I loved their music and atmosphere. I only knocked a star because we went for dinner, but they don't serve food."}
{"text":"The night to bar hop/ pub crawl. My intentions are usually to stay put in one spot for the night but for some crazy reason not on this night. Started at Taco guild to Bevvys to Pameroy's then Honor Amongst Thieves. Didn't even know about the place that sits atop of the Stock and stable. As you walk upstairs you can appreciate the somewhat hidden location in plain view. This place is very cool - great drinks, good music, and good looking crowd. Great vibe in this place. Had a blast. It is not huge, but not too small either. I would drop in and check this out!"}
{"text":"Honor Amongst Thieves is the coolest second-story bar I've been to! The ambiance is very dark and mysterious. If you've never been, you might have trouble finding it. The back stair well that leads you up to the bar makes you feel like you're an exclusive member entering the venue.  The drinks are really different as well. My friend got hers with cotton candy on it! People who go, tend to stay for a while. Seating is pretty limited and there is not much space to move around or dance. It's a fun space for groups though."}
{"text":"I wish I could find a cocktail place this good closer to where I live. This place had it all: great atmosphere, wonderful, unique cocktails, warm service. It reminded me of my years living in New York. Definitely a good date spot, but get there early before it fills up."}
{"text":"Good drinks, nice place.... problem is i showed up with 1/2 tank of fuel... left with no gas, people in the area steal ypur fuel... mfn scumbags, wont be back"}
{"text":"Outstanding Speakeasy.   Monday's are Rat Pack Mondays so the music is all Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin style.  Can you get any better bourbon drinking music? The bartender Steve was friendly and engaging.   He answered all questions with style and a little comedy, really helped to make the night.   The Old Fashioned are fantastic.   We asked for a suggestion and were treated to a Bourbon Sour.  Great taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Cool upstairs speakeasy in the heart of up and coming central Phoenix area. The speakeasy is around back and up the stairs of Stock and Stable. The bar has a dim lit inside lounge and a couple booths outside. We came on a Saturday and found a couple of seats at the crowded bar. Saturday is their dj party night. The beats were great a mix of 90s notorious big to nine inch nails and rob zombie. The music was super loud though for such a small place and it was hard to hear conversation or talk to the bartender. Other than the music being a bit too loud, the place is cool. A good selection of speciality cocktails and a huge liquor list with some craft beers on draft. Cocktails and beers are priced from $7-$14 so basically on par with most places or a buck or so more. Two cocktails and a beer with tip ran us about $50 so not too terrible for the quality of cocktails. Definitely a cool place to check out and start the night off for a drink before wandering around."}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place! I've been back multiple times now and always have amazing service and great drinks! The atmosphere is perfect with its dim lighting, comfy seating, and mix of people. Perfect for a fun and semi low key evening!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with 4 people.  We were provided one menu and told another was unavailable.  After finding our first drink, we ordered.  No one made eye contact for a second drink or asked how my friends mescal recommendation was.  Time went by and no one brought the bill until we asked for the it.  Bartender seemed bothered by any additional questions.  Nice atmosphere but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Service this evening was slow. AC was cracked on high which being February made the experience less than ideal so after just one drink we left, otherwise would have stayed longer."}
{"text":"Behind Stock & Stable, up the stairs, you'll find a stunning and handsome bar with an endless wine and whiskey selection, black leather couches, gold LED lighting, gold and black print wallpaper, and classy accents. Definitely dress up if you intend on coming here, it feels like a high end 1940's bar with a slight modern twist.  I ordered the Rocky Point Rendevous which comprised of vodka, peach puree, fresh orange, and cranberry juice. Felt like a spiked smoothie, it was quite good.  There's tons of seating at the bar since it's close to being a wrap around bar, there's also a lot of couches so don't worry loungers!  The bathrooms are unisex, and very clean.  Service was good. The bartender would come to personally take our order and ask if we were doing alright, even though we chose the couches which were a ways a way from the bar.  We came on Monday, and I'm glad that we did, it was Rackpack Monday so they played Sinatra all night which was lovely and certainly matched the place. On Tuesdays they play the 80's, on Wednesdays they play live blues, on Thursdays they play \"classic music of a featured artist\", and on Fridays and Saturdays they have a DJ."}
{"text":"This trendy SpeakEasy sits on the second story of Stock & Stable in the Central Plaza known as The Colony.  You need to know up front that if you are looking for a happy hour destination or somewhere to buy inexpensive drinks, this is not your place. If you are looking for a cool environment with craft cocktails that can be made to your specifications or left up to the decision of the more than capable mixologists, then this is your spot.   My favorite aspect here is that the mixologists know what they are doing and are more than happy to make you drink that will keep you coming back for me. When I go here I ask for something Vodka based, tart, and with soda Water. Each time I eagerly await the concoction that is crafted and am always satisfied with what is put in front of me.  There is definitely something to be said for the staff, atmosphere, and quality drinks here! Make sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic! Low key, dark, awesome furnishings, and of course the drinks are awesome!! Great speakeasy type of place. Highly recommend with friends or date night. Great dj on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this place. Regularly take clients here when they are in town.  Last time here, the music selection made it feel like we were in the Continental from John Wick"}
{"text":"*This review applies to non-douchebaggery days of Sun-Thurs, before the tinder crowd that rolls in around 10ish    The definition a classic bar. dark atmosphere, large display of bottles, mood lighting and  bartenders who not only know their trade, but take pride in it as well. Engaged in convo but not to the level of someone working at Dutch Bro's.   You might find yourself with a few other folks and it's just wonderful.  Fri/Sat is a #SS with people who don't know how to act at such a bar (yes i'm old) and I generally stay away..but hey..if that's your thing and you enjoy the company of kids who need to check if they can afford two rounds...vaya con dios."}
{"text":"I've come here in the past and I have never had the greatest customer service but because its such a great hangout and the drinks are consistently delicious I always return.   Last night was a huge disappointment. My friend was in town from Seattle for the weekend so I took him there. It wasn't his first time but I wouldn't be surprised if its his last.   We walk into the bar and the bartender hands us two completely different menus (one wasn't the food menu). His menu had the reverse HH side plus a giant tear in it. My menu didn't. We order two beers. He comes back with the price and asks us if we want to keep the tab open or close it. My friend says I thought the beers are on HH. He comes back and says we don't do that anymore. My friend says to him well wouldn't that cause some confusion then he says \"do you guys want the beers or not?\"  I could see the bartenders arms trembling out of anger and/or frustration. We weren't even confrontational about it. We simply showed him the menu and suggested that they should get rid of those menus or honor the HH price. I'm very disappointed in the customer service because I have spoken highly of this place. We bought the beers which ended up being our only purchase."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this super hot and new hidden gem two Sundays ago.  A girlfriend of mine and I walked up to Stock and Stable hoping to find some late night special aka reverse happy hour and the hostess directed us to the secret speakeasy in the back alley up the stairs behind Stock and Stable-which also has reverse happy hour by the way!    We walked into a dimly lit cocktail lounge with handsome, friendly and accommodating young bartenders who sure know how to craft a delightful cocktail.  We were greeted with free shots of house made liquor.  I had been recovering from a cough and had a thought!  I asked the young gentleman to make a hot toddy and he was right on top of it!  It turned out perfect.  I also ordered off the cocktail menu and had a delicious gin martini with an olive in it.  We then ordered some savory late night bites-fries and sliders.  My friend at a cocktail where they lit the rosemary in her drink on fire-pretty entertaining!!!  Refer to video clip I uploaded-also can be found on instagram!!!  Yippee-go check out this secret fancy local spot before it gets too busy!!!"}
{"text":"This is everything I want in a speakeasy/gastropub! Moody, dark, old school atmosphere. High bar top seating surrounded by comfy and cozy booths. Lots of signature craft cocktails acomanied by tons of spirits, and a nice little beers and wine list.   I just felt transported to a different time and place as I walked up the stairs in to a back door of Stock and Stable. I felt a little wrong. The good kind of wrong. Our bartender looked like he had possibly stepped out of a steampunk film.   I loved this place so much I think I might even stop in tonight! Thank you for bringing something new and different to the Valley!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, decent cocktails. Music is too loud and doesn't match the rest of the bar but they play solid tracks. Bartenders haven't memorized their menu. They didn't have a liquor on their menu."}
{"text":"Not so secret. Not a speakeasy. Just a bar like many others in the biltmore cenpho area. This is where rich women from PV go slumming. Lame crowd. Not chill. Drinks good. Food okay. Trying too hard."}
{"text":"This is a great speakeasy-vibe bar. I asked the bartender to come up with something unique and surprising on command with a few clues like coconut, non-sweet etc, and she did so on command and with great improvisation! I would say that the initial menu is lacking, and focuses on low end liquors, however everything we tried was quite well blended and signified an understanding of the art of the cocktail. I had my doubts upon waking in... Thoughts, \"trendy,but good?\"... The answer is yes... I love both trendy and good, so a balance of both is key. Just give them a try  and also.... Let's continue to encourage cocktail bars like this to build/improve in Phoenix! Overall, I think it's worth your time with an open mind... And don't be afraid to challenge the bartender!"}
{"text":"I have some mixed feelings about this place. It's a new trendy \"speakeasy\" above the Stock and Stable restaurant (stairs are in the back of the building). The first time I was there, I thought it was super cool. The next few times, I realized it wasn't as cool as I had thought. Everyone seems to dress up because it is kind of a classier place. There's a big bar with a huge selection of liquor, has comfy seating and tables on the outside of the bar and a couple areas of couch seating to reserve for parties.   Even though there seems to be plenty of seating, there never seems to be anywhere to sit. I was only able to stand behind everyone at the bar to try and order a drink. I've only gone there on a Saturday night, so I wonder what it might be like on a weeknight. I gave it a 3-star because it's a cool place, but it's definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"This bar is located above Stock and Stable. Very low keyed love the ambience and the location. Drink was on point and the atmosphere was relaxing and fun. A couple bought us a drink so that was nice and unexpected."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, the whole speakeasy kinda vibe (which I generally consider a complete douchebagary, but here it works). Love the music/DJ, drinks are better downstairs in my opinion. Good service, bring your friends to entertain you people, bartenders are there to serve you drinks and since drinks are $12-14, $1 tip per drink won't suffice. This isn't your neighborhood watering hole, it is the experience you're paying for."}
{"text":"Wow - we loved this place from the moment we walked in!  You are immediately transported somewhere else and I love it!  We found a place at the bar and ordered some tasty cocktails.  Mine had pear brandy with champagne and my hubby had the bartender make his version of a pineapple martini - so delicious!  Great atmosphere, great bartenders and great drinks = we'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Valentines Day night my husband and I had just finished a swanky dinner up the way and wanted to finish our night with a nightcap. As per usual, we scoured our Yelp bookmarks and decided to check our Honor Amongst Thieves, as neither of us had yet to have gone to this new place in the corridor in which we frequent. Based on reviews and the 'hot and new' on Yelp, I had seriously high hopes of grandeur when we entered up the stairs and back to this bar, (No. This is not the definition of a \"Speakeasy\", which usually requires a passcode to enter and a secret way in.. is up the stairs in the back of a building truly a secret? No.). Weirdly on Valentines Day night, a night thats all about dates and romantical stuff and things.. or even for singles awareness night! Honor Amongst Thieves was pretty empty. Weird, we thought. Not that we were complaining, but we always find it odd when a hyped, highly anticipated place is empty on a 'popular night'. We sat at the bar and looked over the ample cocktail menu. I was impressed with the cocktails and the whiskey and bourbon menu is ample, if you are a whiskey or bourbon type. I am not, but it still impressed me. I decided since my night had included four wine pairings with our meal, that it was probably just safe to stick with boring wine, so I asked if there was a sparkling wine or champagne that I was missing. The bartender who initially seemed friendly to us, said she had one and it, 'was lovely'. Well, I took one sip and it was not lovely. I hated it. I am not even sure what the white split bottle she poured me, as she never let me see the label. I found that odd, immediately. My husband ordered an IPA, because again, we aren't as young as we once were and mixing alcohol when work calls the next day may not be in the best favor of our heads! We just wanted to try something and someplace new and cool. The decor here is nice, classic and the booths are many, but I can see how this place could fill up and get crowded on a weekend. The bartender noticed I didn't like the champagne she gave me, so she offered a suggestion of a My Saint Melanie, and I asked her if it was sweet. To which she responded, 'I'll make it anyway you want it..'. Okay. I decided it was worth a try, without even looking at the menu. I just trusted her. That isn't her fault. Again.. I didn't care for it. But it was better than the crappy stuff with bubbles that I could barely swallow a sip of. This My Saint Melanie was super sweet to me. I looked at the menu and should have known that the ingredients of Pineapple infused Gin; Chartreuse; Fresh Lemon and Champagne would probably equal a whole lotta sweet. My sweet may not be everyones sweet. I declared this one my fault. My husband finished his beer and we decided to call it a night. The bartender didn't seem to care one bit that neither drink was okay. Whereas, I sipped the My Saint Melanie because I actually felt bad for not liking anything here and didn't want her to completely hate me, (I don't know why I care about these things at the time, but I do), she didn't care that one sip was taken of the crappy bubbly and within 3 minutes I was requesting something else. There was never a mention of , 'I'm sorry..' or , 'Hey, how about I take that off the bill and we start over?' Nothing. She just didn't seem to care. She gave us the bill and while grabbing that full glass of bubbly, guess what... She managed to spill  half of it all over the bar where my new Kate Spade little bag was sitting.. boom. I am done. Did she mean to do that to me? I sure hope not, but she did look strait into my eyes when it happened. The entire bottom of the bag was soaked.. and luckily it was leather so it didn't  soak through. Again, not even an apology. She simply wiped it up and away she went. Okay. The jokes on me, I guess. She seemed to be engrossed in some humorous conversation with the other bartender and that seemed more important than her customer service. We tipped her decently despite it all and not a goodbye or a thank you as we left. That said, I don't think I will be a return-er to the 'hot and new' Honor Amongst Thieves. I can handle a lot of things when it comes to new places working out 'new place' kinks, but the one thing I have no patience for, especially when the drinks are pricey, as you will find they are here,  is terrible customer service. That is what we received on Valentines Day night here. There are SO many new, and not so new, trendy, cool vibe and even some real 'speakeasy' bars in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.. this one just doesn't jibe with me. I don't mind paying a premium for a good drink or wine but I also want someone to be nice and have manners when taking the money for said premium priced drinks. So Honor Amongst Thieves, that said, you won't be honoring or thieving my money , or getting into my champagne doused designer purse again.. thanks for sending me home though with the smell of cheap bubbly! Cheers to that.."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a night cap with friends during a week night (Wednesday I think), and glad we did. It has a great speak easy feel, dark and it just smells so good!Their cocktail menu is great and their liquor selection was superb! They make a killer old fashion with the nice, large, cube block- I can't stand it with regular ice. Keen in mind the entrance is upstairs in the back side of the building. Highly recommend going here for drinks. I cannot attest to their food, but I'm sure it's great!"}
{"text":"If anyone gives this hideout a less than 5 rating they do not have good taste... for great drinks and also decor and crowds. We need more spots like this in the valley."}
{"text":"Note: it's upstairs on the backside. Lol, I feel like the other restaurants and bars in the area are so used to people not being able to find this place yet they're all so cool about it.  Once you find this spot though it's pretty cool, it reminds me a lot of Counter Intuitive in Old Town Scottsdale. Cool drink menu, dark and intimate and super loud.   Came in with a friend, I had an old fashioned which was pretty good and she had The Rocky Point which she seemed to like. This spot, although it's similar to places I've been to before, isn't your typical Phoenix area bar. I'll be back for sure, it has a very chill vibe and has a good mix of people in there. Very cool concept but I wouldn't call this a speakeasy, I feel like it's just a low key high quality bar with a weird entrance."}
{"text":"Impressive gin & bourbon selections.  Fantastic ambience.  They had live music (guitarist) both times that I've been.  Ambience & decor - they have put a significant amount of effort into making this place awesome.  The couches are very comfortable.  Bartenders - very knowledgeable & professional."}
{"text":"I really like this place very exclusive ... I didn't like the bartender too much because he had a attitude bigger guy .. but the selection of drinks was amazing . I enjoy his place"}
{"text":"It's a cool, hipster, speak easy. They are a bit pretentious at times. The drinks are solid, but not spectacular. Still a great place to get a drink and enjoy some company with friends   Selection of liquor is very good.   Wish they had food"}
{"text":"The perfect ambiance of sophistication, elegance and swag. Perfect for a first date for one with style and grace! Ladies, wear the best heels in your collection!!! #6FtDiva #BlackBarbieBombshell"}
{"text":"Went here last night w/a friend. The space is cool, but I was underwhelmed. AMT maintains the speakeasy saloon ambiance, which is pretty much the reason for the 3stars, but besides that, we were unimpressed. Drinks are priced as they'd be in DC or NY or LA, but they don't deliver; service broke down after an hour of being there; and while the complimentary shots of Jäger was a nice touch I couldn't see the spot's appeal aside from its location."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. The environment is spot on! When you enter you feel like you've just completed a heist and go away with it and now it's time for a drink around other thieves. The craft cocktails are marvelous, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Hmm, strange experience. Came here on a wed evening. Not sure if we had high expectations, but for a place that's sort of a speakeasy and difficult-ish to find, we expected the drinks to be great! Surprised that we were handed a laminated A4 size menu. Very surprised that there were just 7-8 cocktails on the menu, maybe u can order whatever you want and they will make it!? Anyways went through the small cocktail menu many times, nothing sounded excited, ended up ordering a couple of them. They were both very tart and not remotely interesting. I think we didn't even finish them and left. Went to other places in Phx and had a great night!! Much better places in the area"}
{"text":"Spectacular place, spectacular cocktails on the menu, spectacular crowd.  Ordered -  Say No More - refreshing cocktail. You get light hints of honey in it. Absolutely stellar. Devil in Red Dress - also tasted refreshing. Worth a try if you are a Gin lover.  Prices are comparable to other places. Good crowd and lady DJ on the stage was cool to play some cool music. Must go places I would say."}
{"text":"I pulled out my phone at the bar to write this review- delicious drinks and INCREDIBLE staff.  When a drunk and obnoxious woman tried to make a scene by complaining, they swooped in and solved the problem by moving tables and adding chairs to make sure everyone kept enjoying themselves.  I would have come back for the cocktails but I'm going to make this a regular spot in my rotation because of their people."}
{"text":"Low-key upstairs bar! Very posh, but not pretentious. Ambience is very masculine and sexy. Perfect for a girls night out. They serve excellent drinks."}
{"text":"Shits expensive holy fuck $54 for 4 drinks damn.  But dooope spot super chill plenty of room if you wanna bring a girl to a chill spot this is the place A++++"}
{"text":"Always on the look out for great places to eat and drink in the valley we stopped in one evening (after having dinner downstairs).  Heard about it from a friend on social media.  We lucked out and snagged a table off to the side as another party was leaving.  It was busy but our elegant server made an effort to quickly bus our small table and brought us some \"welcome shots\" while we looked over the menu - a nice gesture.  We each ordered a cocktail (off menu, standard drinks, which were all good).  The music was loud so it's not too intimate. It's relatively dark throughout (with the only true light source coming from the centralized bar).  4 stars for our kind server and well made drinks.  I really want to like this place - think we'll sit at the bar next time and see what the bartenders have up their sleeves."}
{"text":"We had a not so good experience dining at Stock and Stable and decided to come try out their bar above. The manager Sam, whom I spoke to previously, was working the bar and took such great care of us. He unexpectedly took care of all of our drinks and turned our night around. Sometimes you can't control how all your employees act but he took control of his own situation and seriously made our night. So thank you Sam, we will definitely come back to see you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Always accommodating and the bartenders know their stuff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is terribly slow. We were here early (8pm) on a Saturday.  We sat at a dirty table for 10 mins before a cocktail waitress showed up. After she cleared the table and we ordered 3 pretty simple cocktails we waited for 20 mins for our drinks.  We immediately asked for the bill for our overpriced cocktails. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Stopped here last night for a little bit after dinner.   First time here.   I like it.   We sat on a comfy couch, ordered drinks, and chatted.  At the beginning, we were by ourselves on the couch large enough to seat four, along with two chairs across from the coffee table in between.   Then another three couples came in, and we chatted with them for a tiny while before leaving for another engagement.    The music was a tad bit too loud, making it a little hard to hear each other, but really am not complaining.   I would go back.   Perhaps next time we will spend more time."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when friends told me to meet up here and I accidentally walked into Stock & Stable looking for this place! Walk around back and up the stairs and you'll find yourself in what feels like another era. It's dimly lit with dark wood everywhere, the menu looks like it's straight out of some legit speakeasy themed escape room, and I'm pretty sure I spent the first 10 minutes of the night just reading through the names of the cocktails.  I had the Church on Time which has muddled blackberries, rye, orange torres, fresh lemon juice and all spice dram. All the cocktails are in the range of $12-$14, but it definitely felt worth it once I tasted them. Strong pours and delicious.  Make sure to look around and really enjoy all the intricate detail put into everything. You might even find a couple humorous objects randomly placed. This was a great find and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I always come for the atmosphere and the drinks.  It has been one of our 'go to places' for craft cocktails.  Service, drinks, and an upscale atmosphere keeps us coming back.  Unfortunately, our last visit was so disappointing that we will consider whether or not it is worth returning.   We sat at the bar.  Only ONE other patron at the bar was cashing out.  Two Bartenders.  Perhaps 12 other patrons were sitting at the tables.  The first bartender was making drinks.  Although we were sitting within 3 feet of him, he ignored our presence... not even a welcome... or hello.  After a short period, the other bartender came up, tossed a couple of bevnaps in front of us and asked 'what will it be?'.  hmmmmm. We ordered our two drinks which were served without comment. My drink was simple: Titos and grapefruit juice.  The grapefruit juice was TART and had a slight 'fizzy' zing to it (a sign that the juice is turning).  I tried to drink it, but it was BAD.  I asked the other bartender to make me a martini (something safe).  He fixed it without speaking to me.  So weird.  My friend finished his drink.  Two bartenders walked by without noticing an empty glass.  My friend pushed his glass towards the bar rail.  We intentionally sat and observed if either bartender would acknowledge us.  They both walked by several times, and seemingly ignored us.  Remember, we were the ONLY TWO People at the bar.    I finally asked for the check, paid the $25 bill, left a small tip, and a note about us being disappointed.  We left.  I would have given 1 star, but must say that our service on many previous visits was top notch.  I can't, however, condone this level of rude service in a slow setting.   Many of my friends come to this bar.  Some knew exactly who the bartenders were and have described the same 'non friendly atmosphere' provided by particularly ONE of the bartenders."}
{"text":"Great whiskey selection.   Choose the best night to go as everyone was watching fight night... sat at the bar and enjoyed whey minute.   Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and overpriced drinks. As much as I wanted to love this place I couldn't. If you're looking for a place where this music is so loud you can't hear yourself talking and bartenders with no emotion here's your spot."}
{"text":"I did enjoy how I had to make an entrance from the kitchen to hidden steps, once up there it was a very and I mean very dark and quaint whiskey looking bar with alternative tunes in the background. I did like the selection of gin drinks that made my evening pleasant to compliment the meal I had from Stock & Stable. Next time I will look into getting some of the chesses' that were by the bar area."}
{"text":"Honor Amongst Thieves is a very swanky bar, some say there are no signs on the outside, but if you know what you are looking for you will see it. (little picture of the eye on the side of building)  This is a pretty bar rich in detail from the tables, booths to the detailing on the ceiling and gives off the speakeasy vibe. If you want to impress some out of towners, or friends you should bring them here.  I was up at the bar, where all the action happens, and after checking out the drink menu I knew I wanted to try the My Saint Melanie, which was gin, yellow chartreuse, fresh lime topped with champagne.  This was a pretty drink and tasted great!  I loved the vibe of the place, bartenders & servers were friendly and not pushy. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Drinks are amazingly my service fantastic. But for real this DJ Hartbreaks is out of control! We could hang here all night with him spinning. He rocked the whole spot!"}
{"text":"This bar should definitely keep the late night food menu. I feel it's preposterous that all the food we can get is a cheese and charcuterie board. I've heard others complain about the lack of food upstairs. Great bar, absolutely beautiful, just hoping to see more food up there. When people get a few cocktails in them, it's definitely smart to sober than up with some late night food during the week and not just the weekend (which is the only time the other late night food is available at midnight). Other than that, there is an amazing bartending staff and atmosphere! We may be back, but definitely after our belly is full!!"}
{"text":"My drink had no vodka in it. The crowd was terrible and rude. Great space, but wasted on a wannabe crowd."}
{"text":"OMG! Love! The drinks! The DJ!  If you don't mind loud music you will love it! The \"Say No More..\" will hit the spot if you LOVE gin.  The music was great. Ambiance was awesome. Came with a group of friends and every song played made for great conversation! Definitely will be returning! Just wish they had food..."}
{"text":"I would have originally rated this place 4 stars.  They had a great thing going but the place is going downhill.  I was optimistic they would keep the clientele \"selected,\". Unfortunately anyone can get in...and it shows.  Too many people, which slows down service etc.  is the antithesis of what this place was the first few times I took guests here.  One of the few places I could drink Louis XIII in peace.  Unfortunately now it's filled with peasant rabble and I have to find some place new."}
{"text":"Modern \"Speakeasy\" in appearance, but not in experience.  Lots of wood and leather decor, soft amber lighting, a great beer, wine and liquor selection, bearded mixologists that make smooth and satisfying cocktails - I recommend the Hotel Nacional (rum, pineapple) and the Busty Loo (vodka, grapefruit) - and an attractive, diverse crowd in an upscale setting.  Yet, a bit more \"clubby\" than most other speakeasy-style bars I've been to, as on the Friday I went the DJ was spinning modern and classic R&B and pop with added drumbeats that was altogether quite intrusive. Most of these speakeasy-style bars I've been to conduct business in more hushed tones and subjugate the music to the background to enable conversation; Maybe that's just my personal preference.  I look forward to going back sometime in the not-too-distant future, it's just not the place on the weekends to have long conversations with your companion(s)."}
{"text":"The setting is classic, 50s era smoking lounge. Though the stained mirrors on the walls, elegant velvet couches, black leather paneled bar and dark wood accents feel more like we have stepped into a century old establishment.  The cocktail menu is in keeping with the classic feel of the bar. Whiskey, rum, fernet. Inventive takes on classic drinks - but not something that is in everyone's wheel house.  Our motley crew sampled six of the cocktails featured on the menu. Perhaps it's that none of us appreciate bitters like we should, but we were all a bit underwhelmed. The menu of spirits here in stark contrast to what you will find in the restaurant below, and I love every drink I have ordered from that menu.  The place seats about 80, and it appeared there were two servers to a packed lounge. It was some time before anyone came to the table. In fact, our server passed us a couple times before acknowledging we were there. One of us headed up to the bar fully prepared to order cocktails for everyone at the table. They returned empty handed, as bullying up to the bar to place an order was an effort in futility."}
{"text":"Super cool spot!  My girlfriend showed me this place the other night and I'm a huge fan...I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in the area.  Very speakeasy/dark/old world style....great date or hangout spot."}
{"text":"Nice dark speakeasy atmosphere. Nice for a cozy date on one of their couches, or a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, though a little pricey. Dark but not too dark. Good music. Felt like I was in NY, especially with the prices."}
{"text":"Located in the second story of Stock & Stable in the Colony sits this adorable little lounge. It's dark, trendy and serves up an eclectic mix of cocktails (think from your traditional Old Fashioned to a Martini made with cotton candy!).  Service was super friendly and they made a mean Whisky Sour and I was totally digging the vibe of this place. Can't wait to head back here for another girls night out soon!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place but was overall confused about finding it was going to work. It's easy enough though. You walk up the black stairs onto the second story and go inside and you're there!   Heads up, it's EXTREMELY dark inside but a cool vibe. It definitely has speakeasy elements and from the moment you enter, there is a level of sophistication you feel.   The details with the decor are really amazing. From the ceilings, to the chairs next to the tables, walls.. I was just blown away. The ambience really matched the style of the place as a whole. I was very impressed.   The bartenders were nice and greeted us, we then grabbed a seat. A cocktail waitress brought us a book with their normal offerings in it, but on all the tables there was already a seasonal or rather, special menu.   I don't remember the name of the cocktail I had but let me tell you, it was divine. It was the perfect amount of sweet with a beautiful color and gradient effect when I first got it. My friends also thoroughly enjoyed their drinks.  10/10 will DEFINITELY come back!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with a group of friends. We had a great time. Loved the mysterious feel of a hidden speak easy. The cocktail servers were dressed in classy black cocktail dresses lending to a classic feel.   We tried several of the different specialty cocktails but unfortunately I can't remember the names of them.   Service was a bit slow, drinks where a bit pricey, but in all the atmosphere was cool and we had a great time. I will come back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with the Hubster and the service was great. The place was packed and a bit loud but there were several groups having a good time. Be prepared to spend a little $ as the drinks are o the pricier side, but IMO, worth it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Bartenders were awesome and friendly! Haven't been back but looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Place has some of the best cocktails in the valley. It's like a little speakeasy on top of the restaurant. If you're looking for custom cocktails a place to relax and enjoy some good company or just let the day wine down this is your spot. My wife and I have come here several times for cocktails and continuously bring friends to enjoy the night with us"}
{"text":"Wow! Heavy handed pours, a creative menu, dark ambiance and thick comfy seats make for an evening you won't forget! We had a small event here and they took care of us for sure! A handful of us stayed back as they opened for the general public and it looks like this place will be around for awhile!   Try it, you won't be disappointed....but get a DD because it's highly likely you'll need one...."}
{"text":"Don't look for a sign with the name of this place lol. A simple arrow sign and a stairway leading to a metal door with a paper sign are all you will find. They do not open until 6 PM but boy they fill up quickly after that. This is not a beer bar. It is an upscale cocktail bar. Interesting mixologists interpretations of classic and not so classic cocktails prepared in a very attractive if dark lounge area. There are probably twenty small tables for four, a square bar that seats about 20 and an area with sofas for a more intimate conversation. An eclectic music collection plays in the background and you are greeted at the bar with a welcome aperitife . There is a small beer and wine selection but this place is for cocktails. They do offer a small charcuterie selection but we did not try it. Definitely will return. Keep in mind this place probably only holds 80 to 100 people and the note on the door warns of possible lines due to fire code restrictions on the number of patrons. Do give them a try."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hidden spots to grab a drink. Music isn't overbearing, it's usually busy but still has comfortable seating. Menu has changed 3 or 4 times but it's only growing with their specialty drinks. Love it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad, but I don't. I love a \"speakeasy\" bar and while they had the idea they definitely didn't have the atmosphere. We took a seat at the bar and tried to talk to one another over the loud music and even louder, packed room. The music seemed like it was someones iPod put on shuffle. The place got busy and people started to stand behind people sitting at the bar. I'm okay with that set up when I'm at a bar/club, but at any other cocktail bar or speakeasy I've been to it's typically seating only. The few drinks we ordered were good but the bartender seemed very new to bartending. He kept leaving bottles on the bar and would walk away for long period of time and return to pick them up, very trusting of the customers? He also poured very slow and took his time making the cocktails. My boyfriend ordered a drink off the menu and the bartender replied \"we can't serve that one tonight\" - with no reason as to why and didn't try to recommend another drink. Was very disappointed with the whole experience."}
{"text":"Hidden gem that is a must go to if in the area.    This has all the feel of a speakeasy. Great decor, great music, and excellent cocktails by fantastic bar tenders.    There are no real signs but just follow the people upstairs and you'll have no issues.  They have a mix of couches, seats and plenty at the bar top for such a small place.    Cant wait to go back and enjoy plenty more drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday because I heard they had great cocktails, atmosphere, music and people were great! Cocktails sucked! I ordered the same cocktails 3 times and they were always all different! I would only come back if they fire their current bar manager and have someone with bar / customer service experience who can execute a great cocktail and teach others to do the same! All employees seemed clueless!"}
{"text":"Loved music, casual yet sophisticated vibe. Yummy drinks. It felt like a nyc local bar."}
{"text":"Great lounge! In the spirit of a speakeasy this rooftop bar provides you with loud pumping music, big comfortable chairs and sofas to visit with your mates, and an exceptional bar with friendly expert bar tenders and attentive wait staff. The ambiance is dark and soft, with indirect lighting and vintage feeling tin paneling, gold crusted walls, and unusual fixtures. The drink options are plentiful and delicious, particularly the whiskey selection - very impressive!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are the bomb! Great atmosphere and delish drinks. Vibrant lounge experience and great for groups."}
{"text":"Those looking for a hip, premium, and new cocktail bar need to look no further than uptown. Behind, and up the stairs from Stock & Stable is so hip you won't believe it's in this neighborhood.   It's dim, but still feels as warm and inviting as clandestine. Every element here--from the seats to the aesthetic of the liquor shelves themselves--are elegant and pleasing. If you take someone here for the first time, I've no doubt they'll feel special. It just all comes together so nicely! And it's old-timey...classic, even, without feeling antiquated. Like, my friends would always say \"Wouldn't it be rad if we could time travel to the 50s?\" and I'm like \"Dude that's inconsiderate! Have you not looked at me once?\" But now I totally get why they're feeling that.   I can dig Sinatra when I'm clutching a big glass of whisky.   So about the cocktail menu...it's short enough to avoid leaving customers paralyzed with choice, and it's long enough to highlight an array of premium spirits anyone can love. Some cocktail bars really want their top-shelf to have this bold, distinguished flavor. Like, they want their rum cocktails to *really* announce their presence and envelop you with one monolithic taste. But at Honor, I don't think I've had anything mixed better in the valley. Like how their Ryes and Fall (Rye, grapefruit, lemon, ginger, Creme de Violette) assumes I know and thoroughly enjoy rye, and is showing me a new way to savor it. They grab my taste buds and demand I challenge them more than ever.   And while whiskey is over-represented here methinks, they are far from ignoring the rest. They make the best Corpse Reviver in town. The Private Eye, with its gin and champagne over cotton candy, is sweet enough for the most basic of guests but still intriguing enough for the self-proclaimed experts to nod. What kind of genius looks at the French 75 and takes that as a next step? Amazing, right?   So if you're not sold yet, I've gotta say the service is outstanding here. I am so gosh darn tired of being treated like I'm being done a favor for blowing a Benjamin on a classy night out. Sick of the holier-than-thou hipsters, the condescending, iPad-wielding doormen, and unfortunate time limits I've endured at other establishments. I'll leave it to you to guess where I'm talking about. Anyway, Honor treats me nice. They always acknowledged me, even when it was hella packed. They always make sure I am enjoying my order. They treat me like I'm *valued* and so I will always, always recommend them above any place else in these parts.   It's accessible, but the snobs can kick it too. Check it out, and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem recommended by a friend. We went in for a night cap. Great vibe. Lucked out with two seats at the bar. Solid cocktail menu and bartenders have some skillz. Easy to walk past -- entrance from behind another restaurant that faces 7th. Will be back"}
{"text":"We came here around 10:50pm, party of 5. As we walked around a space became available at the bar for us to stand. We think to ourselves we are in luck. Music was great we were ready to have a fantastic time. Fifteen minutes later, we left as we could not get any service from either of the three bartenders or even take the time to acknowledge us. How embarrassing as we live around the corner and we had guests from out of town. We won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"The decor of this place takes you back in time. This embodies what I would envision a classy speakeasy during prohibition. The New York Minute cocktail is my favorite. Great place!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Had to stand and wait a while for a seat but eventually got one for the four of us on a Friday night.  The atmosphere in here is pretty nice but it is loud.  About as loud as downstairs in Stock & Stable, but saved a little by the fact that the seats are closer together in here.  3 of us had drinks.  My friend ordered an Old Fashioned.  It was fine, nothing outstanding, noting bad.  Just a solid Old Fashioned that didn't end up too sweet.  I ordered the Misery Loves Company, and it was pretty underwhelming, on the verge of bad.  Watered down by too much ice, what could have been a slightly sweet, refreshing, slightly creamy summer drink turned into a cup of muddled, mild flavor.  Wife ordered the Rutte of the Problem, a gin based drink.  Her's was good.  Well balanced, slightly sweet, slighty citrus, with very mild bitter notes.    All told, the place evens out to a 3-star review.  We could be convinced (pretty easily) to return.  On a less busy night perhaps, and with different drinks to order."}
{"text":"Pathetic attempt to make an exclusive \"speakeasy\". Went on a Saturday night around 10pm after dinner downstairs. Walked upstairs onto a cement platform with VERY bright, bad lighting that was a major buzzkill. There were several other little groups and couples up there scattered around. After a couple of minutes the door opens and one of the groups goes in. Door shuts and that's it. The rest of us still standing under the bright lights. A few minutes later another couple gets let in. Meanwhile the remaining people on the platform are loud and obnoxious. One female patron was yelling obscenities and clearly drunk. One other group was men wearing flip-flops and dirty tshirts, or ripped up shorts. Looked like they had been doing yard work all day. Yet the door continued to open, almost as if it were on a 5 minute timer, and the door guy let these people in, but only a group of two or three at a time. It was clear he was going in order of arrival. Which was frustrating because my boyfriend and I were dressed up and had to wait while the vulgar drunk girl got in. Then the \"landscapers\" in flip-flops, etc. Which is fine, I have no problem waiting in line if that's the process. BUT they might as well put up stanchions!!! And stop pretending to be an exclusive, high-end place considering they let anyone/everyone in anyway! They should just make people form a line and treat it like a ride at an amusement park - the crowd was definitely comparable.   Either way the \"door man\" (Thomas) was very rude. I won't return based on his attitude when greeted. The entire experience was a hokey waste of time. Far too many quaint, cool, craft cocktail places in Phoenix that don't make you wait \"X-amount of time\" to get in, just to elude you into believing you're somewhere super exclusive, LOL!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricy for just cocktails. Very slow atmosphere. I'll find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place can be kinda hard to find -- park in the back and you'll see a staircase leading up to the second floor. Walking up the stairs and down the short passage way you'll see a single door with chairs and tables leading the way. At first glance it appears mysterious or some sort of password needs to be given to enter.  Upon entering you can see the restrooms are on the right and a small hallway with a curtain straight ahead. As you move the curtain and enter the room you instantly feel transported to another time. If you're a fan of Bioshock or Medieval style RPGs, then you'll definitely love going here. The aesthetics of the room gives it really good vibes and adds a feeling of mysteriousness to the place. The air also has a sweet welcoming scent. I ordered Sense and Sensibility; It's a gin with pineapple and rosewater, and garnished with a flower for appearance. I enjoyed how this drink tasted, felt clean and cool. Perfect for summer."}
{"text":"This place is so stupid and the stupid general manager has a nasty attitude.  I would not go back to this place even if it was free. Drinks are weak and the food is so bad. It's midtown not Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My kind of place!   Amazing music, dark, dungeon-esk/intimate type of feel to it.  I never got a chance to try their food, but I'm sure I will come here often. It's located on top of Stock and Stable, and the set up is very unique.  I love how they have a balcony outside of the bars front door and how it overlooks pretty much everything.  On our way out, I ran into a coworker that was just getting there. This guy wouldn't let me go home, he actually made us stay and drink more. Which wasn't a bad thing but that goes to show you that Honor Amongst Thieves can initially be an intimate night then turn into a party in the blink of an eye.    If you follow my reviews then you know that I'm all about handcrafted cocktails that are concocted from love and experience.  Honor Amongst Thieves drinks were pretty good, I didn't really get a chance to try many more because they turned into shots later that night.  I definitely will be coming back, the location and atmosphere was on point!"}
{"text":"This place is above a restaurant and it is a small place so be prepared for it to be crowded during weekend hours for sure. The cocktails are a lot of fun and are similar in price to places similar to this bar. They had a dj the night we were there playing early 90's and some 80's music which was fun but since the space is so small it was hard to hear the waitress or the bartender but overall the place had a variety of customers and the staff were friendly. I would go back to try some of their other specialty cocktails I had church on time and busty Lou. Both very good"}
{"text":"my go to cock tail place! really good and strong cocktails with quality liquor! not too bad of a price for the quality of the cocktails. Really cool speakeasy kinda vibe. if you go through the stock and stable entrance its even cooler. their is also a patio entrance. always clean. professional bartenders just the right amount of friendly. they slice your meat and cheese plate to order too with a cool old fashioned hand crank meat cutter.  I cant say enough about this place! I love it! be a regular for about 4 months now. the weekend is more crowded but if your cool with that its a good mature vibe. the only thing is that you get your food at stock and stable, there is no food menu in the honor amongst thieves bar but that's ok because I think their cocktails are amazing. in short go and see :D"}
{"text":"Honor amongst thieves is a great low key bar with a speakeasy vibe. The lighting and decor around the bar really create a perfect environment to enjoy some well crafted cocktails. The two bartenders I dealt with were very helpful in helping me choose one of the specialty house cocktails. They really put effort into each drink and make sure they come out tasting great. I enjoy my drinks on the strong side and was not left disappointed with the drinks I received here."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks $12-15. Ambience is great. Dj was meh. Didn't have to wait very long for a drink. A lot of the cocktails are on the sweet side. Cool location, in the back of a shopping center."}
{"text":"Fantastic service ( I think his name was Steven). Server took time to explain the drinks in detail and understand what our tastes were.  He was in no rush as far as taking the time to chat with us, yet super efficient when it came time to deliver the drinks and refill our waters The drinks were great, ambience great.. Got rather packed and loud around 7pm.. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great service. Horrible, loud music that doesn't match the vibe at all. Horrible chemical smell that didn't go away."}
{"text":"Our friends showed us this place and overall really cool joint. It's a speak easy with elegant stylish features. Very comfortable shapes and you feel like you're in another time. Overall a super cool place to experience. The drinks are good, and plenty of options. Walking up through the back of the building to get access was cool as I would have never known about this place other than from friends. The only negative is that the drinks are a bit pricey in my opinion. Still a cool, hip and old fashioned feeling place at the same time."}
{"text":"I'd first like to start off by saying that this has to be hands down the most unique bar in Phoenix. The vibe is always great and the drinks are even better. Although every bartender does a phenomenal job I've gotta admit that CHRIS ( the guy with the long hair, tattoos, and hilarious personality is what keeps me coming back here as often as i do!) Either way if your in the area and you want to experience a phenomenal cocktail in awesome setting check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was so cool! For my birthday we went to Stock and Stable for dinner and when I was making reservations online, I saw that they had this exciting bar upstairs. This was a great addition to the birthday festivities! The whole atmosphere of the place was really neat. We were there on a Saturday and there was a DJ, and even though he did not do requests, the music was a lot of fun. My group bunched together and danced. The drinks were also really good. I wish it was a tiny bit bigger for dancing but I understand that the small location in a way added to the atmosphere. Overall, this place was really something and I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Does customer mean anything? The manager here is so rude.  We were sitting at a table for an hour or so having a conversation and he walks over and says \"you have to move. The dj needs to set up.\"  No please. No thank you.  So we moved. When I went to pay the bar was packed so I walked over the servers area and he said \"you can't stand there\". I said \"I just want to pay and I can't get close enough to the bar to get anyone's attention.\"  He said well you can't stand here.   Quality service for sure.  With all the good place to eat and drink in the area I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Great vibe, great drinks, great service. Love the 'shot-petizer' (they give you a shot when you arrive). The first '1-star' review makes me (eye roll emoji). Not super hidden but there IS a hidden door and definitely worth your time. Can't wait to come back and bring some friends!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh... I've been here a couple times and have mixed feelings about this bar.   The good: The decor is nice, it definitely attains the 'speakeasy' feel it's going for. The welcome shot (that was given the first time I visited, but not the second) was good and a nice gesture. They have a good variety of cocktails to choose from.   The mediocre: The drinks themselves are fine, but not as tasty as you may expect. The prices are high. Seating is limited and beyond the two times I have actually drank here, I have been in the bar a few times and unable to get a seat (I understand the place is small...but maybe have someone up front to take names or something? We just ended up leaving since we felt in the way.... ).    Would I come back? Sure. Would it be my first choice? Probably not."}
{"text":"I like what they are trying to do here but there are some kinks that need to be worked out.  More servers or bartenders, definitely.  Also the Saturday night clientele (think Scottsdale bachelorette/Ed Hardy) ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor and craft cocktails!! They have music theme nights and the staff is attentive. Great place to meet up before dinner or a night cap. There is a dress code, which I like. Just review the website! Great place for a date or with friends!"}
{"text":"Really loving these hidden speakeasy bars. For sure took us a few minutes to find. If you read some reviews it helps you find the entrance but I won't give it away since finding it makes the experience that much better.    Look for the red light in the sky is all I can say.    When you walk in the ambience is dark with candle lighting.  The bar gives off most the light and makes the vibe perfect to have drinks in.   The bartender Sunday night was very helpful and quick with our drinks.  Oh and the drinks were amazing you won't be disappointed in what you get.   Sunday was nice and chill but from we are told Friday and Saturday is the time to be at this place with every seat full and a dj in the corner.   If you want a fun night make sure you make a stop into this place and just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"LOVE this bar. Very well decorated with a great, dark ambience. The drinks are awesome and service is top-notch. It was pretty quiet the night we came here, got a booth, and had a great time hanging out with our friends and having drinks.  I'd definitely plan a trip around coming here!"}
{"text":"Actually did not have time to try any drinks here, but the decor is really impressive.  The back of the bar is beautiful with all the bottles nicely illuminated.  Nice atmosphere for small gatherings of friends.  I think their air freshener was the scent of men's cologne, which is kind of weird but I didn't hate it."}
{"text":"This a one of the best looking bars/lounges for the grown and sexy. The service wears excellent and the drinks amazing! Great place to kick It and chill on a Wednesday night or Saturday."}
{"text":"New York minute was one of the best drinks I've had in Phoenix! Super sexy dimly lit bar great for a nice speakeasy before or after going out. Little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"The cocktails in this swanky dark overcrowded place always take my breath away. Nothing like an Old Fashion... but this time with a black berry treasure inside that gave me nothing but happiness. Nice music but small so get there early and enjoy. Treat yourself to top-shelf heaven."}
{"text":"Wednesday night so it was pretty empty - cool speakeasy type of lounge tucked behind other bars and restaurants. The service was a little spotty, which is why it was 4 instead of 5 stars...I'd go back."}
{"text":"I have never been to an upstairs speak easy, but this place was really amazing. The decor inside was stunning, and the drinks were delish! I love hidden spots, I will definitely be back (if i can remember how to find it) LOL"}
