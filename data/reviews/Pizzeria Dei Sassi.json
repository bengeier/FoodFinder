{"text":"Pizzeria dei Sassi catered to a company party last night for about 40 of us. The food was amazing, the ambience was intimate and friendly and the price was reasonable. They  do amazing hand made pizzas and authentic espresso. They do casual lunches as  well. Highly recommend! Thanks guys, we will be using you again!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Accommodated group of 40 with a full buffet. Very reasonably priced. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.
The sauce is amazing. You can taste the delicious basil.
There is real real bacon in the Cesar salad...very yummy.

They unfortunately do not have a drink menu. So it's either older style alcohol choices to make a drink with, pop, or bottled water. I am against bottled water so that was disappointing. 

However after giving it a second try, the tasty pizza has made up for the disappointment I had previously left this place with.   
I am now a fan.

Thank you for the authentic Italian pizza"}
