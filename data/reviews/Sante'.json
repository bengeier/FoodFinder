{"text":"This place is really romantic and cozy great menu and great service."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but I've been seriously disappointed twice. The latest go around was for the NYE meal. The fixed priced meal was extremely lacking. I was beyond disappointed in the salad as well as the filet. It was charred to a point of overpowering the flavor. The salad lacked anything impressive. The dessert also had a strange \"charred\" flair. I want to love  this place but have been disappointed not once but twice now. The service was fantastic as was the wine, aside from that I am so upset to have wasted 200$ plus my time here for New Years Eve."}
{"text":"Structurally, the restaurant is quite charming - in a row of buildings on the national register of historic places, lots of exposed brick and tin ceilings.

Lunch service is \"leisurely\" - not quite slow, but certainly not at a pace that will get you back to the office in an hour.

The menu always underwhelms me though.  Not sure if it wants to be french (see the cheese plate appetizer which is large enough to be an entree), southwestern (several items are infused with chiles, corn, avocado or black beans) or something else.  

This is a place we go once or twice a year as a change of pace.  But I can't seem to find anything compelling to bring me here more often - although I'd like to find one!

Note to either server or kitchen - if the soup of the day is a Shellfish Gumbo, why put calamari in it?  Or has calamari become a shellfish?"}
{"text":"Came for a business dinner with a top client. Ordered the filet mignon because I was in the mood for a steak. Typically not a filet fan, as they have little to no flavor. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE HERE! The flavor was extraordinary, very tender but bursting with what I would expect from a strip. The fingerling potatoes and onion straws were a perfect complement. What set the meal into the stratosphere were the roasted beets. Fresh from a farmer's market, roasted to bring their sweetness out. Literally like eating candy they were so good. Will be back again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"First let me say I have history with Santi going back 15 years. And, I love the place for its food and ambiance. This latest experience was marred by  a sense being rushed out. In spite of spending over $200 for two, we felt rushed out the door by our waiter. Up to that point our service was very good, and our food was excellent. Too bad we felt we we where being ushered out the door."}
{"text":"Food and service were what should be expected by a restaurant of this caliber - HOWEVER - the attitude of an much older woman with a British accent could be changed and hopefully the owners will have a word with her!!  Very rude and the main reason for the one star.  I would consider returning  BUT only - after I run a spy pattern to insure this Downton Abbey understudy isn't in the wings."}
{"text":"My fiance and I headed here for restaurant week excited to try a new place in the area that looked to have a unique menu. However, I was even hesitant to make a reservation as the man on the phone was not very welcoming and acted as if I should be lucky to get a spot during restaurant week. All that aside, we made a Friday evening reservation. 

Downtown Matthews is a cute, quaint area and the restaurant fits right in...from the outside. Walking in you feel like you're walking into someone's dining room unexpectedly. We honestly thought we came in a side door. The reservation I made was apparently put under my last name, which they could not find. I understand my last name isn't easy, however if that is what you are to note it under then ask me to spell it or clarify. 

Atmosphere: The waitress was extremely nice and welcoming. However, the table we were sat at was right next to the \"bar\". The bar consisted of one of the owners sitting and yelling orders, moving stuff around in an already loud and dark setting.

Food: The menu set much higher expectations than what came out on the plate. The presentation was great. I ordered the steak, medium, but got rare. The flavor was good so I was hoping to eat more but couldn't get past the mid section that was dripping inside but burnt outside. My fiance got the mushroom parmesan crusted chicken which also had good flavor, but a soggy skin ruined the texture and removed most of the flavor once you got to the meat. Dessert was supposed to be a flour less chocolate cake that appeared to be quite fluffy and moist.

If you are looking for quality and a nice relaxing meal I could not recommend Sante. Gordon Ramsey would certainly have a lot to yell about here as well."}
{"text":"The service was awful. It was probably 15 minutes to get menus; three hours to get thru entrees and dessert. We were in absolutely no hurry but geez that is ridiculous. The patio is totally non descript and overlooks a parking lot.  My husband's dinner looked very good, my scallops were fine, served with beet risotto, tasty but there was some sort of puke green sauce that was really weird. The bread pudding was delicious. We walked to music in Stumptown Park after which was nice. A pleasant enough meal but kind of doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food gets more flavorful with every visit!  Adam truly creates masterpiece dishes. A real gem in Matthews. A family favorite for decades!"}
{"text":"So I went for my bday dinner during restaurant week. Normally I am a little nervous about service and food. Just b/c I have worked in the business and know how people think.
However, the food both portion size and taste was absolutely amazing. Flavor and presentation was pure perfection. I even got the quail and loved every bite. Our server was absolutely delightful, believe her name was Tiffany, and she made sure that we were taken care of every moment. 
If u want great food and service, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent,  chef quality food, wonderfully served in a friendly,  gracious manner, all in a charming room."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places to dine.  Went with a friend during the Queen's Feast, 2017 and my plate almost looked like I had licked it clean.  I had been one time before and the same thing happened. LOL   We had our favorite server, Brenda,  and she was as charming as ever.  I had the scallops over rissotto and they were excellent. The roasted beet salad was also delicious.  My birthday is coming up in a few months, so hoping someone wants to take me to dinner  here.  I highly recommend this little French restaurant.  I love it."}
{"text":"We had a small event here and the food was OUTSTANDING! A bit pricey but wow. Great stuff and quite a variety of it was enjoyed."}
{"text":"I was in the matthews area and decided to checkout downtown Matthews. I spotted Sante and we decided to check it out, glad that we did. 

This is a very charming little restaurant, nicely decorated with art from local artists and a great ambiance. Definetly a great spot for a romantic dinner.

We started with cocktails, I had the \"Lovers\" martini and my wife had the \"Strawberry\" martini, both were excellent, although the first round took quite a long time to receive.
 
We decided on the avacado egg rolls and gazpacho soup as appetizers, both appetizers were excellent and very flavorful. we wanted to try the crab and avacado towere, but they were out of this dish for the evening, maybe next time. We moved on to the beet salad and aragula salad, again both were very good.

For dinner I chose the Mustard crusted salmon, it was simply amazing and cooked perfectly. My wife went with the scallops and they too were PERFECT, 

The service is very friendly and not overbearing. Most of the service staff appear to be very young, but they have definetly been trained well. 

This restaurant is worth the drive from uptown and downtown Matthews has a great small town feel and there are enough other bars and restaurants in walking distance for a nice night out. 

WELL DONE SANTE, KEEP IT UP!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a date night here a few weeks back.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere, and the charcuterie plate was amazing.  The waitress was great and very helpful in the selection of cheeses and wine.  We will definitely be back and try the amazing specials they had.  I think this place is a gem in matthews!"}
{"text":"Amazing scallops in an intimate setting.  Worth every penny, but I disagree with the \"$$\" rating, it should likely be $$$-$$$$."}
{"text":"Good service & food in Matthews. I ate dinner there and while it was traditional food, the quality was
excellent!  Great service too!  I had the orzo pasta with shrimp, nice saffron sauce, mild flavor. We shared the greens & beet salad. It was tasty but a little small to share.  I think the prices are reflective of the fancy atmosphere for downtown Matthews.
My pasta was $21 and only had five or six shrimp so I think it was good food but should include more shrimp. The bread was tasty and nice olive oil dip. Also they have a nice selection of wine. The wine specials were a good price, I liked the Pinot Grigio.  I parked across the way at the street parking."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fantastic and the food was good, but the service and overall experience left something to be desired.  We did a double-date here for restaurant week.  When we arrived, our drink menu in the center of the table had a note about the reservation following ours hanging over the top presumably to \"remind\" us that they were very busy and the table would be needed again that night...we also received a call confirming our reservation stating the same earlier in the day.  Our waitress, Brenda, claimed she couldn't work an iPhone to take a photo but would send the \"bus boy\" to take one of our group.  The most insulting portion of the evening was when Brenda chased us down Trade St. yelling that we hadn't left copies of our receipts.  We absolutely left signed copies and explained that; however, she insisted we come back to the restaurant and sign a new copy with the tip added.  During that (embarrassing for us) walk, she proceeded to inform us how embarrassing it was for her to have to run down the sidewalk yelling after us.  Overall, I was not impressed and will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is more like four dollar signs than two! The charcuterie was amazing as were the scallops. The only negative I have is that my veggies were undercooked. It was a great place, we were just kind of caught off guard in terms of price due to the previous reviews."}
{"text":"Big city dining in small town -- intimate atmosphere with a chef who clearly cares about taste and presentation. The dishes all had fresh, seasonal ingredients that really made the food stand out from other restaurants. The waitress was attentive and knew the menu well. Highly recommend if you are dining outside of Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is the full package - they have excellent food, great service, and a nice wine list. I love the quaint atmosphere of the historic location and the paintings by local artists as decoration. I also love the fact that they are big proponents of using locally grown meats and produce whenever possible. I highly recommend the local vine ripe tomato salad. On one visit I had the honey mustard glazed salmon with coconut basmati rice & asian mango salsa - delish! The desserts are fabulous as well. We have only eaten here during the week and the place is rather small, so if you are planning on going over the weekend, I would definitely call ahead for reservations"}
{"text":"The atmosphere isn't super fun, but that's more on the clientele eating here. People watching ends pretty quickly when your subjects are married couples who eat in silence. Sad. We got the center table, which made me us feel like the life of the party! 

Their wine list was pretty extensive (we settled on Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling). The dishes here are as humble as the charming cafe-inspired décor. Great veggie toasts, fish entrees, though the vegetables on the side aren't very inspired. The attitude was welcoming and service was gregarious. Solid choice for Restaurant Week, but not a knockout."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for Restaurant Week despite living in Cornelius and it being in Matthews based off of one thing: bacon wrapped trout stuffed with polenta, crawfish, and taso ham. I'm originally from Louisiana and it tasted like Louisiana and North Carolina had a delicious baby. The food was outstanding. My only complaint about the food was that I ordered the mussels to start with and while they were delicious there were quite a few empty shells and no loose mussels in the bowl that just escaped. I wish I knew where they had gone because I wanted to eat them. My boyfriend has the zucchini cakes and holy sweet mother they were amazing. Just the right amount of spicy and sweet. For desert I had the pot de creme and he had the cobbler and both were equally to die for. So why am I only giving it 4 stars? I felt our waitress, while super sweet and nice, had her attention possibly focused somewhere else. Everything came out in a timely manner and she even held our deserts for us so we could finish our glasses of wine I just wish she would've asked maybe once or twice more how everything was. I also felt a little awkward just walking in and there was no hostess stand or anything, which I think someone else mentioned. I would definitely give it a try not on Restaurant Week for a special occasion since it is quite the hike."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Sante' often and every time we dine here we are more and more impressed. GREAT food, great service and  a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this little romantic restaurant.  Great food and atmosphere.  Check out the covered patio!  Also a wonderful place to meet your girlfriends for lunch.  Every time I eat here the service is good and all my friends love the food.  The chef is also very handsome and attentive!"}
{"text":"We ate there in December and attended their holiday Dinner Theater.  It was delightful and the food fantastic!  It is a great place!"}
{"text":"Nestled among the tiny, yet bustling, storefronts of downtown of Matthews, NC, Sante has always been a reliable special occasion destination over the years. With most entrees priced in the $22-35 range, it is a splurge for my wife and I,  but we have always walked away pleased. The menu is limited but covers all the bases and the small dining area is either cozy or tight, depending on your perspective.  Either way, it has is charming and comfortable without feeling stuffy. I have felt equally comfortable there in a suit or in jeans. The service however falls a little short.

We kicked things off with the she-crab soup at $5. It was tasty but its hobbit-sized portions size were disappointing. Our salads were excellent however. My beet salad was uniquely prepared with paper thin slices of beet used as a foundation for the rest of the salad. They ran $10-12. 

For our entrees, I went with the savory gnocci with meatballs and mushrooms and my wife selected the shrimp orzo. Both were exceptional and plentiful. (To fully enjoy, their delicious sauces, ask for a spoon.) They ran around $22 each. We each had a glass of wine which our server was incredibly stingy with.

Speaking of service... our server Brenda appeared very uninterested and seemed to place more emphasis on getting back to the bar to chat with her friends than serving us. Despite a sparcely filled dining room, it still took her 15 minutes to get us the tab and then only after we had to request that she do so. It was definitely not the kind of reliable service one would expect from such a high caliber restaurant. In fact, we had planned on finishing with dessert but opted to pass solely for this reason. 

Still, don't let that you prevent you from trying this place. In my mind though, service alone drops it from a 5 star to a 4 star experience and also stops it short of a Gotta Try. By the way, if you ever get a server anywhere that you are displeased with, kindly ask the manager for s different one."}
{"text":"My favorite special occasion restaurant for many reasons...downtown Matthews, quaint building, chef visits with diners, quiet, lets you take your time, uses local farmers market produce... Did I mention delicious food!!??"}
{"text":"Beautiful Romantic Dinning Room!  Comfortable, Charming Romantic Patio!  Intimate and did I mention Romantic?  Everything was very good!  Last night (Sunday) was my first dine here and this is one of the places I picked to taste for Charlotte Restaurant Week!

Gazpacho was the First Course - Chocolate Cake with Raspberry's was the second and Beef Tenderloin (ordered rare served Rare!) with potatoes and green beans was the third course. 

The service and food was all very good - Nothing was excellent!  The decor might get five yelp stars everything else gets a solid 4 stars!  I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"They had $7 martini specials and the lemon drop was wonderful. I had their osso bucco which was so tender you literally broke it apart with a fork. The spaetzle was light and a nice complement to the meat. I am not sure what I expected from chestnut spaetzle, maybe more flavor? However, it's not a criticism as it was very good. I loved the ciabatta bread with garlic oil, and two tender pieces of garlic that I realized was soft enough to spread on the bread. After I ate it lol! I would say it's intimate as well, I ate on the back patio which was nice. I want to try their appetizer plate next time and I think they'd do an amazing job with fish. I went alone with a Kindle book which is why I chose the patio but they had it setup inside for a big group i.e. a party. It's a DATE place as well :) I went in work clothes but noticed that people wore casual clothing as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be going back, want to try a dessert too!"}
{"text":"Sante is always an excellent choice. The patio is a great environment. The menu has a good mix and can satisfy a group with diverse tastes."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Everything on the menu is great, the dining room is quiet, relaxing, and unpretentious, and the service is outstanding. The outside dining area is also a nice option. It's wonderful to have Sante's fine dining right in downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"A fabulous meal, exquisitely prepared, and served by courteous and attentive wait staff is what you can look forward to at Santé.  Owners Veronica and Chef Adam Reed are welcoming and wonderful hosts.  Chef Reed's mastery of French style cuisine is evident in each carefully constructed and well balanced dish that comes out of his kitchen.  This experience is not to be missed and is a true local gem in the heart of downtown Matthews."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night with the wife. Good ambiance with a patio and inside dining. Went during Queens feast and enjoyed every course. A must for all."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal - everything tasted wonderful- I had the filet - cooked to perfection and all 4 of us loved our meals . The calamari was delicious and the desserts were very yummy! Service was also great. Our waiters was attentive but gave us plenty of space. Will definite return"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and service
Stingy wine pour- maybe 4 oz?  The server kept asking if I wanted another glass and all I could think was \"I'd really like the rest of my first glass\"
Small portions for pricey food
Not much of a deal to get the Queen's Feast during restaurant week, unless you choose only the priciest menu items
Food taste lacking in creativity and flavor- my scallops were tasty and cooked well, but over a nondescript bed of couscous? (I forget already) and veggies that were over cooked
Air conditioning was barely on when its 95 degrees outside, making the whole experience a bit unpleasant

I agree with the other low ratings posters here- why all the 4 and 5 star reviews?  

I've been to many restaurants at this price point and this place isn't anything special."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and good service. We try to visit a couple times a year and it is one of my favorite places. The red braised cabbage is a must!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I just wish the prices were a little lower so that I could go more often. The quality is escellent and the portions are a good size."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic.
All of the food is fresh and perfectly prepared.
The staff is wonderfully attentive without being overbearing.
I don't know how to explain the atmosphere other than to say it is a small restaurant that can be romantic for a couple but they can also handle a large table of diners.  We have done both and enjoyed both types of visits.
We do reserve this for special dates.
Let's all support locally owned restaurants!"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware!!!

Look out for the discount coupon book and avoid it like the plague. Although this restaurant has decent grub, they rip you off when they try and sell you a discount coupon book. Here's the scam: they sell you \"coupon book\" which by the way you never see as they\"retain it\" for you and you get a 20% discount on several visits to the restaurant
Sounds like a deal doesn't it?

But in the fine print they stick you with a 24% mandatory tip....even on the TAX!

So you think you are getting a bargain and instead you get surly service and a huge bill!

Stay clear of this ripoff  establishment if you value your cash. The manager will not talk to you or look you in the eye."}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere and the ambience were very nice! They have a great selection of specially drinks (martinis).  Their food was alright.  We had the duck and filet.  The duck was too rare and the portion was very small.  The taste was not what we expected as we eat duck quite often. The filet was overcooked but it was a tender piece of meat...adequate flavor.  Both meals were lack luster.  We had heard very positive things about the owners and the chef.  Meh.....

The evening began at 7:25pm and ended at 9:40pm.  This was unacceptable for an upscale, very tiny small restaurant.  Our server was a big let down.  She waited on three tables of two.  We found her to be a pleasant mature woman.  She was always over at the bar cleaning glasses, stacking glasses, moving glasses (how many glasses can you have?), looking through papers, talking to other waitstaff, and not paying attention to our needs.  We had to get her attention for refills on our beverages several times. Alcoholic beverages add up.....bigger bill, bigger tip! At times, she couldn't be found and we had to ask someone to get her.  We wanted coffee and desert, again the bigger bigger still applies.  She was nowhere in sight.  Eventually we made it through to the end and there were only two other people there eating.  When we got there it was full.  People who had gotten there after us had long gone.

Unfortunately we will not be back.  Service is very important to us and we feel that this was way beyond our patience.  It was a painful experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. This is what a restaurant should be. This place embodies everything that is good about high end European restaurants, but right here in Matthews."}
{"text":"Sante' is one of my wife's and my favorite places.  Chef Adam is a Master Chef.  The service is always great and the ambiance is always relaxing."}
{"text":"Based on the good reviews -- and the high prices -- my spouse and I expected a great meal. We were so disappointed. 

I chose the \"Pumpkin Gnocchi Pasta with Merguez Lamb Sausage, Mushrooms, English Peas and a Sage Cream Sauce\" and asked for grilled chicken on top instead of the lamb sausage. I was told that the gnocchi would be made with spinach instead of pumpkin. 

What I got was a plate of mushy creamed spinach along with mushy lumps of spinach/potato that were sort of fried/browned/blackend. It was barely edible. No discernible spices or herbs. Maybe it would have more flavor if I'd kept the lamb sausage instead of swapping for grilled chicken breast, but it doesn't change the fact that for $21, this was a badly prepared and presented dish, and nothing like the actual menu item I ordered!

My husband chose the special: Scallops over risotto with vegetables at $35. Again, barely edible, uninspired and boring. Four Scallops over very plain risotto, a few spears of steamed broccoli on the side. 

The overwhelming good reviews make me wonder (a little) if we should give it a second chance. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the service was fine. When we visit Matthews again, maybe we'll try Sante again for lunch when we wouldn't have to spend as much. 

Blah food plus high prices, and the fact that their website is awful and partly broken,  make it only 1 star for me."}
{"text":"Went here for my fiancee's birthday dinner recently!  I was so excited to give this place a try.  Locally owned, right down the street and somewhere we had never been before!  When we got there, the waitress seated us at a table near a window.  There were only about 10-12 tables in the whole restaurant and I was actually surprised at how many people there were.  It happened to be 1/2 off bottles of wine night so we ordered one of those.  There were two servers both of whom were very sweet and accommodating. 

We started with a featured watermelon and arugula salad, which was really good.  For dinner, I had the steak and my fiancee had the featured dish (a grouper with a saffron couscous i believe).  The first time my steak was over cooked, but they fixed it and sent back out a better medium rare.  Everything had a good flavor, but what was the most disappointing was the prices for this type of food.  We spent 100 dollars on a bottle of wine, a featured fish dish, one salad, and a steak.  If it had been a filet or some other cut of beef, it would have been a little more reasonable to ask people to pay 24 dollars, but this was an 8 ounce skirt steak.  I just don't see the value in that.  If this were a little more reasonably priced, this would be somewhere we would frequent a lot.  I think they also get most of their vegetables from the farmers market across the street, which is nice.  

It was just a bit disappointing.  For the price, there are plenty more locally owned places with the similar feel to them."}
{"text":"Attended their annual Christmas dinner and a show for the first time and it was an amazing experience!  The food was delicious, the service was great and the show was spectacular! Carolina Voices acapella group sang all the great Christmas songs. They really put us in the Christmas spirit. Will definitely return. My butternut squash soup was soothing and refined. My salmon was perfectly seasoned and rested on a bed of to-die-for creamy mashed potatoes and the dessert was a perfect ending."}
{"text":"I really do have to knock this place down a couple notches - I think they're getting higher marks than they deserve owing to location. We moved here from NYC and have dined in many major cities at very fine restaurants for the past couple decades (in addition to Manhattan). That being said, Sante is offering up NYC prices and NYC rudeness right here in Matthews of all places. The Queen City is known for it's friendliness so we were actually quite taken aback when we received a call a couple hours prior to our reservation time asking us if we wanted to \"come in earlier\". The caller actually offered that up as if it was some sort of prize we'd won - \"hey...guess what, you can actually come in earlier than the 530PM res. that you made...you win!\". She must have mistaken me for the 80 and over set, because honestly 530p is really as early I'll go for dinner, I'm good with that thank you. On a Saturday \"night\" no less. When I informed her that I would be keeping my 530P res. and that yes, that's the time I wanted given that that's the time I actually requested, she offered up what seemed to be a soft threat in response...\"okay well, just so you know we have a 7PM reservation set for your table, so, I hope you'll have enough time\". Seriously? They were lucky we didn't draw out our meal to 730P just to be passive aggressive since we were pissed. In all of my years of overpaying at restaurants who mistakenly assume that they are special I have never been treated like that...if you don't eat your meal fast enough we'll boot you out and let the next guys in before you're finished! Really, will the next diners get to eat our dessert as an extra added penalty on us too? Maybe just don't make reservations so tight if you're worried about it Sante. The fact is that we made that 530p res. before the guy called asking for a 7p res., so, how about telling him that the 7p is not an avail. time and offering him a 715p or a 730p? Diners who are already spending close to $100 on a meal for two should not also be expected to pay for acts of poor judgement on the part of the staff. The staff should be the only ones stressing to sort that stuff out. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the food was deserving of more credit than just one star. While the food is good, it was nothing I haven't seen before. In fact, it was actually quite typical for this particular genre of restaurant. The most noteworthy thing was the bacon wrapped trout, done to perfection. Also, of note, Sante does not know what foie gras is, which is bad, given the genre of the restaurant. They served up liver pate (and not even close to what I look for in a good liver pate) and called it foie gras!! Big disappointment there. Additionally, our waitress was aloof at best until the very end when she became frankly rude. She openly disapproved of my request to take home our leftover liver pate. Waiting Tables 101: we do not wish to know your opinion unless we ask for it, particularly on what we choose to bring home in a doggy bag. It was leftover appetizer we asked to bring home, but her response was what one would expect if one had asked to have a neighboring table's soiled napkins packaged up, to-go. Sante, we had high hopes for you...definitely a bummer, all around."}
{"text":"Chef selections-farm to table-fresh menu never the same. Fun old building brick walls, tin ceiling, and local art. We've have been here several times for Matthews Historical Society dinners that were anything but your standard group dinner affairs. 

We have also gone several times for dinner-fabulous food and great place to show off the Matthews downtown area (take out-of-towners/guests).  20 indoor tables and outdoor seating in back too. 

Street parking-hard to park-traffic never seems to let you out."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the portions were perfect.  The atmosphere was very cozy and warm."}
{"text":"I'm a Matthews resident and have been going to this restaurant for the past 11 years.  I wouldn't call myself a regular, but probably go there six times in a year--for lunch and supper.  

My husband and I have never been disappointed by a meal there.  I'm a somewhat picky eater and approach the menu from the vegetable (always fresh from a local farmer's market) end of the spectrum, while he is fonder of the meats on the menu.  We're both always satisfied with what we get.

The restaurant is in a historic building in downtown Matthews--a beautiful old place and nice setting for a meal. I would call the atmosphere 'intimate.'  The tables are covered in white-tablecloths, but there is a variety of dress there....you'll see people in everything from dressy to very casual attire.

Meals are usually in the $15--$20 range and have artful presentation.

Parking is on the street or in a small lot behind the restaurant (you'd have to go around the block to reach it.)

We've never had a problem with the service, although it's a small staff. You get more of a family feel with their interactions between each other and the diners. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for Queens Feast.  VERY good. Honey mustard glazed salmon, duck, scallops all outstanding.  Small hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I went with my family to this restaurant and we had no idea what to expect. This is quite a romantic place but would still be nice to go with family and friends. The atmosphere of the restaurant was beautiful and very well done. I had chicken (i forgot the name) and my entire family agreed that it was some of the best they've ever had. I also got crembrûlée (spelling??) for desert, it was AMAZING. Everything looked and tasted amazing.  I can't believe I've lived in matthews my entire life and I had never been here. The service was excellent also. 10/10 recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of heart warming. The host greeted us with a huge smile like he had known us for years. The waitress was kind and knowledgeable. Any questions we had that she didn't know she went and asked. The food was all fresh and beautifully cooked and presented. We didn't leave a plate with anything on it the entire night; from the garlic dipping oil to the dessert. An absolute must try."}
{"text":"Real nice local place in Matthews. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching and the food was above average. The menu was somewhat normal for I did not see much that really jumped out at me but the service was good and the quality of the food was above average.

We will be back for lunch or maybe dinner."}
{"text":"Recently went back to Sante during this Jan 2017's Queen Feast and was wowed again.  Felt compelled to write another review and increase my rating.  This place seems to be under the radar but always amazes me and anyone else who goes there.  The ambiance is very intimate and makes it hard to believe you are in the suburbs of Charlotte - it feels like you are in another country or a \"big city.\"   
My husband and I took another couple who had never been and they are particular about their dining experiences.  We all had an amazing experience.  The service was great and even though they were very busy our server, Hope, was very attentive and helped us with our various menu questions.  I can't stop raving about the Cabbage Salad with Pears and Goat Cheese.  Doesn't sound great on paper but it was delicious.  (Side note: after my experience I have been searching Pinterest to find a recipe like it so I can recreate it).  I ordered the special of Amber Jack fish with Polenta and finished off with the flourless chocolate cake dessert.  It was the perfect meal.  Everyone else had ordered other items and all were loved.  Will definitely be going back!"}

{"text":"I dined at Sante for the first time on Saturday, November 9, 2013. It was fabulous. Really fabulous. My dining partner and I began with the she-crab soup. The portions were generous so we both tried not to eat all of it, trying to save room for the entrees. But that was impossible. It was the best crab bisque I have ever had. We nearly licked our bowls.

I followed with the pan-seared sea scallops with black sticky rice and a lovely sauce. I'm not sure if it was the roasted carrot sauce that they show on their website menu, but it was delish. The sea scallops were perfectly cooked and **surprise** the food and plate were just the right temperature when they arrived. This is one of my pet peeves--too many restaurants don't account for the time between kitchen and table, serving food that is nearly cold when it is supposed to be warm/hot.

My dining pal ordered the lamb special. You know how it is when the food is soooo good that you forget to speak with each other? That was how it went at Sante. 

The service was perfection and I love that the space is not noisy, even though it has many hard surfaces. We decided the ceiling tiles must be acoustic and that is why it stays so quiet, even when the dining room is full like it was on that night.

I'm not sure when I will be back in the Charlotte area again, but when I am I will make a bee-line for Sante.  You should, too!"}
{"text":"As part of Queen's Feast I had dinner there last night.  The cream of mushroom soup, lamb shank and chocolate flourless cake I had was delicious!!  Of course it was very crowded (all table were full) so it was quite noisy but has a quant and French feel atmosphere.  My criticism is that we arrived 25 min. earlier than our reservation and anticipated just sitting at the bar for a \"pre-dinner\" drink.....Well we were greeted immediately and told they have no bar and they have no standing/waiting space and told we could go to the restaurant just down from them, have a drink and come back when it was our reservation time.  So make sure you don't plan on sitting and having a drink if your table is not ready and know that you will need to plan on going somewhere else until your table is ready.  Otherwise their food is yummy and I will go back again probably."}
{"text":"Well, let's just say this was a little disappointing. Service was good but when ordered filet mignon, they brought me a tail piece ridded with fat. Most definitely the worst filet I have ever had in my life and I have had many.  I even heard the chef saying to the manager that it was the tail piece and she was ok with it. Who serves a tail piece and pawns it off as a filet, I can tell you who, someone who is trying to get rid of product. Never go here again. If you want a great filet, go to 131 Main."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Very small, quaint and the food is always exceptional. We came for New Year's eve dinner which had a special menu. Four courses and there were four or five options for  each course. I selected the champagne broiled lobster, my daughter had the  broiled grouper and my husband had the fllet mignon. We all agreed our meals were spectacular."}
