{"text":"So I have returned to NMB several times since my review.  Things are getting better and I'm realizing that it's better to drink mediocre craft beer than drink mass produced beer found in most bars in Phoenix.   Was there over the weekend with other people that had been to NMB previously as well.  The pretzel bread is quickly turning into a favorite for all of us.    I've been to brew pubs all over the country and one thing that NMB needs to do is have 3-4 of their best beers on tap at all time.  Then rotate another 3 or so seasonal beers.  Couple of people in my group were hoping to grab a beer that wasn't on tap.   Also guessing that good help is hard to find.  On one trip to NMB I went right after work, which at most places is when it starts to get busy.  The bartender did check on all of us before taking off for 5 minutes for a smoke.  In those 5 minutes a few other people showed up to the bar and had to wait until the bartender came back.  If it's close to 6 PM your bar should be staffed.  Noticed that your employees like to use their cell phones while working.  Had to wait for another employee while they finished up a phone call.    But will keep going back, it's a nice little spot in a part of town that could use a good bar."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but I have had inconsistent experiences. Overall the place needs to find an identity. The food is good not amazing. Beers are very good and interesting, not your average brewpub brew. My biggest criticism would be the service and the pricing. Happy Hour, should be better in my opinion, and the quality of the food seems to have slid a bit since earlier in the restaurants life. I want to go again, they really seem to be trying."}
{"text":"Again I came and again I'm glad I did. There was live music and a ton of upbeat employees. We sat on the patio and it was perfect night for it, our waitress was so nice! We kept commenting on it during the night. I come from the customer service industry so when I go out i expect at least a smile and approachable attitude, this girl was all that and more! I didn't get her name but she had super straight teeth and tattoos? Lol I tried !"}
{"text":"Good IPA, Tues nite music was cool, and food was good!"}
{"text":"North Mountain Brewing is a cool addition to the neighborhood.  It's a little spartan inside, and can be a little loud too.  It's really ideal for a few beers with friends, and a light lunch or snack.  It's a lot like going over to your foodie friends house to hang out.  Try the cake - totally worth it.  Another stand out is the Justin salad."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if u want something quick to go. Staff is not real responsive and moves pretty slow. Hoping the food is good though"}
{"text":"The Beers are excellent!  The food and service was good.  The neighborhood looked a bit sketchy but the parking lot and pub was nice.  All around very good"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed by the food at this establishment. My husband and I both ordered the Sheperd's pie and it was bland. Definitely not worth the price of $12 a plate."}
{"text":"This establishment has the framework to be an AWESOME destination eatery/pub  What is needed: (just my little opinion)  1) Play up your selection of micro brews, take a tip from the micro beer pubs in San Diego. Have \"beer menus\" at each table and all over the place,.. write narratives on each brew, describe its flavor nuances, food pairings etc. And for the love of,... jump on the IPA train! Maybe you usually offer an IPA but not available when I stopped in, if you do,.. I suggest you make a BIG deal about it. (this is a deep pool, know whats out there before jumping in)  2) Have a \"Service System\",.. your wait staff seems distracted, inattentive, uninformed about what they offer, and generally confused. (as in not knowing what to do next)  Again, borrowing from other successful operations devise a \"system\" that is centered around what the customer experience is from the time they walk through the door until they wave goodbye. Train your staff to follow the system for each customer. I really believe you can close your gaps in service this way. This is not an easy thing to do but I believe it is critical to the business.  Reviews that are wishy washy and offer no help are useless to me (as a consumer) I hope you feel the same as an operator. That said,.. my review for the masses is below:  Good food, Good Ambiance, sketchy service and Great beer. You should go, support the effort here and be on the team to build this good place into a great place."}
{"text":"Good service and food. The food is high-end for a brew pub, definitely not the same frozen stuff you find everywhere. That makes the prices a little high, but not crazy."}
{"text":"Tucked away where Cave Creek, Dunlap, and 7th Street meet, North Mountain Brewing is a jewel in the rough. The live music can be a bit loud and you might make some new friends (lots of six-top table options, few two/four-tops), but solid beers and a varied (almost eclectic) menu will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"My review is what it is.   The beer itself can carry the establishment. All of the styles were one point.   The food...Eh. My feeling is they should scale the menu down too the items that they do best. The crab dip that we ordered tonight had very little crab in it and had pita strips that barely were able to pick up the dip. They did eventually bring bigger, wider strips, but our feeing was that it should have been part of their QC process.   I then ordered the shepherds pie. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't exactly warm either. I could have made this in my own kitchen. Any colder and I would have sent it back, but I had waited nearly a half an hour for t and was hungry.   Erica was our waitress and helped us anyway that she could. Unfortunately, this place is not the total package. While the beers are spot on, the food not so much. North Mountain Brewing Co. would have been better off opening just a tap room, rather than  full scale brew pub.   The Red is smooth, the blonde is great, but it eventually needs to lead to somewhere and it didn't for me tonight."}
{"text":"Lunch was amazing! I highly recommend the Grilled Cheese w/ Bacon. It was excellent. This meal comes with soup so I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup which is also very good. My sister ordered the Fish & Chips and says it was great. Overall, food was excellent.   My parents say that the beer's good. My dad's favorite was the Barrio Aged CardinAle Red. My mom liked the Octomalt-Hybrid-Imperial Red/ IPA. Experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Aggressive staff upon walking in.  The bar was full so we hesitated where we wanted to sit.  We were show to a seat under the tv and the speakers for music.  We were asked twice if we wanted to eat and responded both times with \"no, not right now\" to the dismay of the server.   Servers didn't seem too happy.  No smiles or happy attitudes.  Perhaps this was b/c we didn't sit at the bar and were at the table which implies we want food yet the bar was full.  Beautiful graphics and logos.  Beer was just ok.  Food choices looked interesting but not a place I wanted to hang out."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food & beer! The staff is friendly & welcoming! If you are looking for a chill spot... This is it! I recommend the crab dip & Brussels sprout salad! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great craft beers, and fantastic service. We will be back here whenever we are in the area. The brussels sprouts salad was fantastic, just the right amount of heat!"}
{"text":"Shepherds pie, Fried Shrimp, Fried Chicken Sandwich.....*Hands down-Thumbs Up* one of the best meals I've ever had!  BRAVO Super CHEF  Clayton Howells!!!   I was so focused on eating and distracted by the level of quality that taking pictures just wasn't even a thought!"}
{"text":"On our never-ending quest to find the best microbrew, we visited on a Saturday afternoon, not too busy, though the parking lot was pretty full. There's a patio facing Dunlap, but we sat inside, nice d√©cor, bright, airy, inviting lots of TV's for the sports lover. We got the 8 flight, the best were N'eurotic Belgium Ale, a little sweet but packs a punch with 10.4%; The Barrel Aged Octomalt, my fave, was so complex, the rum barrel aging definitely adding another dimension to the regular Octomalt brew. The James Brown Imperial Soul, a stout that was smooth and no bitterness whatsoever. We liked Groovin with a Pict, a Scottish ale,  but it can't compare to our favorite, the Scootcher from Sleepy Dog Brewery in Tempe. We could fill a growler $12-$14 but not with any that we really wanted (N'eurotic, barrel Octomalt, James Brown), so we decided not to. They also have an extensive food menu. I chose the Poutine, french fries covered in a rich brown gravy, awesome ale braised short ribs, and topped with cheese curds, so decadent that I had to share. Good thing, because the hubby chose fish and chips, 3 fresh tasting, beer battered pieces with shoestring fries that was a little lacking in portion size for $12. Add another portion or make the ones you serve bigger, please! Will we come again? Yes, and we will be bringing our friends, too."}
{"text":"Love NMB! Delicious beers and always more than a few on tap I love. Food is killer and staff is super friendly/warm. Come here often and will continue to! $4 happy hour beers that are delish plus stuffed mushrooms/great burger deals....plus legitimately the best pork tacos on taco Tuesday. Do it...you need to!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the pros: The restaurant was immaculately clean as well as the restrooms.  And has a great ambiance.   Everything seems pretty mediocre. They had 4 of their own beers plus one guest tap. Their beers were nothing special. The pale ale, Patrick star and ipa were all very similar. The stout seems more like a porter in my opinion (I love both styles so I did enjoy it).  The menu is a miss match of a worldly items and doesn't have any real flow to it. The food was fresh and well presented. The fries that come with the fish and chips are different fries that come with the poutine and were both disappointing. The fish was great as well as the small portion of short ribs on the poutine.  Everyone I was with complained about the portion for the price. But fresh ingredients are more expensive than a bunch of frozen crap. So I didn't mind the prices, I actually thought they weren't bad.   The cons: Service. The service was horrible. Since we were nearly the only ones there we got our food quickly and our first round of beers came out quickly, although my wife was never asked what she wanted to drink so she never got anything. We were never offered another round of drinks, only dessert. Our server never came back to check on us either and we didn't see her for some time. When we left there was a group of about 6 or 7 employees all smoking in the back parking lot at their smoking area. Guess smoking is a higher priority than a paying customer."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to North Mountain Brewery. I tried their Creem IPA which I really enjoyed, well as their loaded macaroni and cheese. The atmosphere was very relaxed and I would definitely go back again. I would like to try some of their other IPA beers and food."}
{"text":"Been there several times.   Greeted warmly and seated promptly.  Servers took orders quickly and knew the menu well.   Specials were related and all questions answered.  Food served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.   House wine was good and a great value.   My beer snob friends approved of the beer selections and prices.  Service seems to be better than most restaurants.   I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely horrible experience here today. Burger ordered outside was raw in the center. Bought tickets for food and drinks and were told we could use them in the restaurant. Inside, the crab dip very small even though the menu said it was enough for 2. When we asked our server Jessica about it, she told us that everything was pre- portioned and oh well. When paying the tab, server told us that we could not use our tickets on the restaurant tab. Isn't the money all going to the same place? The brewery? The server told us that the owner said we could return our tickets for our cash back at the tent. When returning the tickets at the tent we received a lot of attitude from the man working there. A lady who was also also at the tent, piped up with \"oh...you're the lady who returned the burger\". Yes ma'am, the raw burger. Will never return after the shitty customer service. I'll warn others as well."}
{"text":"Ok 2nd time here and i feel compelled to talk about the food. Ordered the nachos and was not impressed. First of all they put a big dollop of sour cream on top (guess that wasn't optional). Then i got to the next level which was cheese (or perhaps it's distant cousin). Tasted like cheese whizz. Not impressed .....stick to beer please"}
{"text":"This is the type of Public house every neighborhood needs. We just stopped in for a beer and a snack. We found an atmosphere that is inviting, open and kind of quirky. A nice selection of beers that include not only their own kettle creations but well thought out Local (Guest) tap offerings.  For my kindred spirits that enjoy a little bread to go with their beer I must recommend the pretzel, they where fantastic with the ESB. We also tried the wings and I will tell you they are not from Buffalo. They are marinated, grilled, tender and the most refreshing flavor I have sampled on chicken in a long time."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab dip, was a thin soupy mess, our server was either brand new or just didn't want to be here that night, kids meals came out about 25 min after our order, was Mac and cheese and a kids burger. Noodles completely mush! Then a outer 10-15 min later my wife's \"steak\" sandwich and my sausage platter came out. Sausage was the worst presentation of a meal pretty much anywhere. Some lumpy like warm mashed potatoes with??? You guessed it like warm sausage. A couple mixed peppers on top. My wife sandwich was at best a 1.5 out of 10. Then of course cause it's a \"Brewery\" our bill was 56 bucks, and we had waters no beer or anything else to drink. I would rather pay $10 for a Big Mac and throw it in he toilet that eat at North Mountain again! And the hostess on the way out was too busy on her phone, start to finish from the service to the food was poor!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We groaned with delight over every dish. The crab dip, mussels, mac and cheese and sausage platter were yummy. We also had the hefe, dog bollacks?, red ale and caber toss. All excellent beers. I do some home brewing, so after I asked, they gave us a free brewery tour. Very interesting. The food is much better than any east side brewery I have been too."}
{"text":"Just tried this place great IPAs if you are an IPA lover. We only tried a couple appetizers they were very good but I really like the menu will definitely go back and try an entr√©e really like the place it was cool had a casual vibe family-friendly"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of North Mountain. It's probably my favorite place to have a beer in the valley. I'm repeatedly disappointed by 4 Peaks, Ohso, the Yard, and many others that are trying so hard. This reminds me of my favorite small breweries and beer houses in Germany and my favorite neighborhood place down the street from where I used to live in North Portland. The food is good, I love the kale salad (huge), and the poutine is decadent and amazing. The beers are great, I love the red and there's a great American pale on occasionally too. I highly recommend North Mountain."}
{"text":"Ok, I want to give this place 3 stars, but its new, so I grade on a curve.  Food... - YOU NEED MORE SANDWICHES/COMFORT FOOD...  try to bring a pulled pork sandwich or a reuben on  your menu...  The night we went, around 8pm on a thursday, it was busy, parking was pretty full.   The hostess was friendly, up beat... The atmosphere was cool... though I was blinded by the bright lighting inside the restaurant, which for me, is offputting.  We opted to sit outside, which was nice.    The female server, mid thirtys, very nice, tattoos i think, was a sweetheart... However she didnt mention what they were out of, until after our drink orders were delivered...  THEY WERE OUT OF THE BURGER! the only sandwich on the menu... I opted to try the pretzels, and the chicken wings.  My friend got the shepherds pie and the poutine.  We gave the POUTINE  5 stars! great dish! pretzel bites - 4 Stars - tasty sauces CHICK WINGS 4 STARS... - very spicy, a tad over cooked, Shephards pie - 3 stars..  not bad. Beer - very tasty 5 Stars...  I love oysters, but I don't think of them as going with beer, maybe thats just me... I usually would want a martini or a glass of champagne.  Message to the owner : Keep it up! lower the lights! and get a few more sandwiches, you will be rolling in the dough!"}
{"text":"Being medically required to ride the wagon currently, I was there for the food - and it was worth the trip.   First off, they have lumpia, which I've mot found elsewhere in the Valley. When I lived in the SF Bay Area, my next-door neighbor for several years was the local 'queen' of the Pilipina community, and these were her specialty for every street festival, fair, and celebration. NMB's are almost as good as hers, which means they are excellent - and the portion is very generous as well. The two sauces that accompany them are both delicious, but I think I like the peanutty one best.   Highlighting an unjustly maligned vegetable, the Brussels Sprout salad is a very tasty presentation of an off-beat dish. Nicely spiced, the tiny leaves have been stir-fried, I think, and are wonderfully accented by the peppers and other accouterments. The dressing was good, but here's a tip - use the leftover lumpia sauce(s), either ot both, for an added taste treat.   My companion thoroughly enjoyed his Grilled Cheese sandwich - he had decided to forego accompanying it with the Tomato Soup, so he was able to help me polish off the lumpia, which he loved. He enjoyed his chosen libation, too - I was trying to ignore it, out of jealousy. The baseball playoffs were on, so he was happy about that, too.  Other family members are practically regulars here, so I'm sure to be back soon - I look forward to a return trip.  (Just one caveat - the servers who smoke need a better understabding of how far they are supposed to be from the entrance.)"}
{"text":"A close, casual spot. The service is genuine and helpful. My experiences here have always been more than satisfactory. The food is good, not amazing, but good and worth the price. The beer is great, I'd recommend any of their higher ibu or darker beers. If you're a fan of Belgians they have a good option for you. This is one of those restaurants that I could frequent due to the close proximity of my residence."}
{"text":"We love it here! This was our second visit! The staff is friendly and the food and suds are super. We discovered North Mountain Brewing Company when the owner/brew master presented a Science and History of Beer for AZ SciFest. Personable service, great food, and terrific beer! They are family friendly. Patrons include couples, groups, families, sports fans (multiple big screens), retirees, college age, and everything in between!"}
{"text":"Had heard good things about the food here, so I went to fill a growler on Saturday.  After standing at the bar for a bit without any assistance, I asked one of the 4 waitstaff sitting around a table folding napkins and they told me to go back to the bar.  After waiting another 5 minutes without any help from the bartender, I left.  Too bad there are so many employees, but no one to help.  Explains why the place was empty on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Just found out that NMB changed the formula for the Dirty Blonde and the name as well! So sad. Still, the Kaiserlich Dunkle Weiss, Cardin Ale Red, and Mild Child are thoroughly enjoyable.   And of course, the food is always good. I still love the grilled cheese and am always happy with the appetizers- especially the crab dip.  An Oktoberfest beer is coming- a perfect alternative to the pumpkin mania taking over. ;)"}
{"text":"Okay, it's been a week or so since the opening day for North Mountain Brewery.  Cut some slack for opening weekend issues and look at what NMB offers our area.  The food is top notch!  Beers are awesome and keep coming out of the brewery with all the freshness and unique flavor anyone can ask for from local microbrews.  We have been back three times and each visit gets better and better.  This Microbrewery is on track to really make a name for itself in the Phoenix culinary arena.  Not pretentious or fake. Real solid brews and a menu to be proud of.  Kudos to everyone at NMB!"}
{"text":"So far, I learned to STAY AWAY from the nachos. All of the chips were soggy, they were cold, and covered in cheese wiz like sauce. Absolutely disgusting"}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill fast. No flagship beers and not always looking to experiment with new beer styles. Service slow and servers same unhappy."}
{"text":"A great little local brewery and restaurant! The beer is always good, and the food is really delicious. Try the poutine! They offer brunch on Sundays, and everything tastes really good.   My only mark down is that sometimes service can be a little slow, but otherwise it's a favorite place of mine that I will definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Ate here several weeks ago and it was a pleasant surprise. The staff was great! The atmosphere was charged and everybody was looking like they were having a great time..The beers were fantastic and they do flights which I recommend. The food is definitely worth a repeat visit from me and look forward to visiting this establishment again. It was a very enjoyable experience and if you find yourself on this side of town it's a must see."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 for me at this point, but could bump it up in the future. I've been coming here on Tuesday nights which is open mic night. The service is friendly and there are a surprising number of people there for a Tuesday night. Kind of an older crowd. Most of the bands play classic rock, which I can get into. So the open mic night is fun and adds to the atmosphere so that is more of the 4-star-I'm-a-fan category, and I'd like to see what the place is like on the weekend too, so I'll be back. And it's a unique bar and hangout for the neighborhood so it gets points there.  The beer and food is more in the 3-star-A-OK category. I've tried a few different beers and all were pretty good but nothing to write home about. Their beers can't compete with the other more established local breweries like Four Peaks or San Tan, at least not yet. North Mountain seems to rotate out their beers so I could see them eventually brewing up a beer that become their signature just like Kiltlifter is for Four Peaks.   I only got food this last time I was there. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. As my friends even pointed out, the chicken breast on my sandwich was quite small. The chipotle mayo didn't have much of a kick, and I could have done without the bacon jam. I had overlooked the jam when I ordered the sandwich so next time I'll know to ask them to hold that, but I don't really get that condiment when you already have chipotle mayo. And if you want bacon, then you can just order actual bacon and not bacon in jam form, amirght? All that aside it really wasn't a bad grilled chix, and I will add that my friend liked her french onion soup very much."}
{"text":"Gave this spot a second chance after visiting right after their grand opening.  Sat at the bar and found it was dirty, very average food and the waitress acted like she was doing us a huge favor.  Try harder people!  We need better restaurants in north Phoenix.  Lots of opportunities to improve."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 32 people and Candy and the crew at North Mountain Brewery were fantastic. Everybody loved their beer, their food, and the atmosphere. We even had a few crazy kids running around (as kids do), and that staff never gave us any dirty looks; just friendly service. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and the live music was a bonus!   The Funk 49 beer was light and delicious! The food.... YUM on absolutely EVERYTHING we ordered!!!    Lumpia... Basically an egg roll with spicy peanut sauce.  Delicious !!! Crab dip... Again,  yummy!!! Loaded Mac and cheese..  OMG !!!!! But the dessert......\" Piece of cake\".... SAVE ROOM!  It was fantastic! This will become a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Ive been here quite a few times...... Today was last time..... Seated myself..... Bar was full...... Ok... But I sat there for 10-12  minutes.... 5 feet away from where servers we bringing out orders and no one even approached me to even give a menu or say \"be with you shortly\" ...... Terrible!  I was in plain view...... Sorry to see such pathetic service in what is normally a good place"}
{"text":"North Mtn Brewery is a fun local brewery with a great selection of beer to choose from.  The staff is friendly and always willing to let you sample some beer to try.  Dropped stars because a friend and I ordered a side of brussel sprouts and a side of cauliflower ($7.00 each).  The side of roasted cauliflower came in a small bowl and was probably a total of 6 medium florets. For seven dollars....  the roasted brussel sprouts were a little more jazzed up but still small.  I get the side component would be smaller, however, for what was served was way too expensive.  Otherwise, great place to pop by for a local beer."}
{"text":"Great place to see life entertainment in the North Phoenix area!  The musicians were fabulous and so was the food.  I never had Brussels sprouts and thought I would have hated them. I can't wait to go back and have them again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Bartender (Anthony) was both friendly and very knowledgable about the beer and brewing process.  Food was excellent! I had Kobe beef burger...delicious!  Nice neighborhood bar!  We will be back! Thank you north mountain brewing for giving us our new favorite place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and great brew.  Our server Erica was excellent and very friendly. She gave us great suggestions and seemed knowledgeable about the beers. The owner of the brewery showed us on a quick tour and was one of the friendliest people I've met in Arizona.  If you're around in this area, I'd definitely recommend this brewery."}
{"text":"Tried to check this place out.  My bad, showed up at 3:30 and they dont open until 4.  All good - strange thing, dude in brewery t-shirt out front sweeping up the place (not a kitchen worker - seemed like an owner or manager) just looked at us.  Did not even say hello or , \"thanks for stopping come back at 4.\". Didn't really seem to give a sh** about our business or NO business.  So 4 Peaks welcomed up with smiles and thanks for our hard earned $'s.  save your time, attitude seems to go in line with many of the other reviews. Just because you can craft a beer does not mean you have the talent , personality or professionalism to open an establishment for patrons!  Go to Phoenix Brewing anda say hi to Fretzy and the team or  faithful standby 4 Peaks or the many other good brewers and restaurant owners that DO appreciate you."}
{"text":"Ive been driving by this place for the longest time but tonight was the night. I ordered some food to go n enjoyed a delicious beer while my order was up. The beer octomalt  (amazing! ) the food a southwest burger, pretzel n cheese, and meat pizaa (amazing!). I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just attended a food/beer pairing event last night - it was EXCELLENT. There were 8 courses, including 8 beers and 8 different dishes, each with a personal story and description from the brewmaster and head chef in person, who were both funny and interesting. We had a private room with about 20 people and it was a very well-organized, delicious, comfortable experience and we can't wait to go back to NMBC for more beer and food during its regular hours!"}
{"text":"Kayla was great as our server. The pizza was great. Salad was fresh. Wish they offered a IPA that was not a double or imperial. Otherwise we love this place. Would recommend it for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Let me first say I wish I could award 3.5 stars.  NMBco has a lot going for it.  1) The neighborhood - There isn't a ton of competition in this area of town and it is awesome to have a micro brewery this close to where I love. 2) Good quality beer 3) Live music 4) Very nice wait staff 5) The place is bright and clean  It is lacking in a couple areas though...  1) While the quality of the beer is good, I just didn't get the flavor complexity I wanted.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the beer, but is NMBco is going to compete with the other local heavy hitters on taste, they will need tweak their beers just a little. 2) I didn't try a lot of food but the food wasn't terribly great even by pub standards.  Make a good burger, make good fish and chips, and have a really solid pretzel...   If you have to go out with friends and don't feel like going to Sun Up, Four Peaks, Papago, etc.. this is a solid alternative.  Me?  I will just go buy some good bottle and hang out on my porch with friends, did I mention that Sprout's carries Dogfish Head bears now?  That's an IPA i can get behind!"}
{"text":"Seems every time I find a place that is good I go back and I go back again and then I get the food to go and they fail once and I try another time and they fail again. I'm sad cuz I like their food but if you can't get deep frying 101 right...smh the French fries were so full of grease they were limp and there was a puddle of grease next to the fries. The battered cod was also soaked in grease I couldn't eat it. $$ down the disposal. Obviously the grease was not hot enough. Seriously considering not ever going back and continue looking for other places in Sunnyslope, my new hood."}
{"text":"New place with growing pains.  Owner has a passion for beer, so wish him well.  Tyson the bartender Alzheimer's is worse than my 90 year grandfathers.  Reminded him several times for a pint and he still forgot.  The \"James brown\" beer is too blah for my taste, below average brown. The stout was great and the ESB is average.   Menu is small which is a plus."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to North Mountain Brewery in phoenix. It was well worth a trip from the west valley. I usually try my best to seek out craft breweries, but most times I will settle for a descent pub here and there. Ok, first thing is first, the parking lot is located in the BACK of the brewery. I saw the front patio from Dunlap, but still had to search for the parking lot lol.   The atmosphere first walking in was a neighborhood bar type of mood, so that's always really welcoming. Pretty good size bar with all the brews right there on tap, and behind the bar is the brewery for you too easily see and watch some new brews being created. I had two pints and chowed down on something on the menu called the loaded macaroni and cheese. The first beer was the PT42 Red Ale, I thought it tasted great. Beer number two was the Hoy!, I.P.A., always and I.P.A. everybody, if you are going to head to any brewery you gotta at least try their I.P.A. It is freakin' awesome!!! Really good and hoppy, which means full of flavor to the very last gulp.  Ok my areas I of concern was first the easy to miss parking lot, and maybe an open for business could help a little too. The door to the bar had it's hours printed on a sheet of paper and scotch taped to the window. If you choose to sit at the bar be prepared for ALOT of kitchen noise, space is somewhat limited so you will hear and see every single kitchen noise and food creation because there is no wall dividing the two. Still it's a loacl brew so gotta give credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Great place. We enjoyed this brew pub. The beer was great. The food was awesome. And the service was great."}
{"text":"The micro brew beers are fantastic, but the food is surprisingly amazing as well. Many spots that make their own beer focus primarily on a great brew, but these guys could stand alone on the food. The chicken sandwich is \"out of this world\" delicious. It is lightly breaded with a thin coat of some wonderful spread called bacon jam. The name sounds funny but that stuff is the perfect compliment to the chicken. It is impressive to discover a restaurant that can produce food and drink in the same manner that Chopin produced music.  The arrangement of the tables could use an overhaul. Group seating and 6 tops are not the way that most patrons want to dine.  The food quality does over shadow the funny seating configuration. Tables can be changed."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there today and we were both very happy with the food and the service. Our server was very attentive to us.  I had the blackened chicken sandwich which was very good.  My husband had the cheeseburger.  Though slightly small it was very moist and flavorful and prepared just as he ordered.  We both enjoyed  the french fries that came with the sandwich and also the beers we selected.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"A jewel to be found in Paradise Valley. I'm visiting Arizona to assist a relative and had the opportunity to be in this area and stopped in, what a find. Have been drinking craft beer for more than 20 years. We live in the Bay Area and have had the chance to try many craft breweries, this is possibility the finest brews I've tried, their C.R.E.E.M. Ale was killer. I must say the brew master is an artist and knows his craft. This place is worth the visit if you enjoy good brew, did not eat but if the beer is an indication of quality I would guess the food is good. A must visit place not far off of the highway if you enjoy BEER.  Note I am not a yelper but just had too on this one, it is must place to visit if your in the area or even a drive just to go.   Kerry"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, happy people, nice & clean place, smoking area is also cool, parking is easily accessible. The best beer i ever had, try their mother of beer! And food is so delicious, they took care of everything. Prices are okay, me & my friend each one had hefe beer and mother of beer, we both shared the fish & chips plate -it's a big plate- as well as the kale salad -vegetables mix, so tasty!- .. That was all for 40 something $$ ..  Good for groups, good for couples. I spent this night there and it was very fun time & I'm totally willing to go back..  Have fun people!"}
{"text":"Great local craft brewery with surprisingly good food. We came here with a large group to watch a world cup match. Our server bent over backwards to make sure we had a great experience, which we did. Beer was great. Caber Toss Scottish was my favorite. Followed by the C.R.E.E.M ale. Food-wise, the shepherd's pie was delicious. Had the poutine, too, but would opt for the shepherd's pie over that when we come again. Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"One star because \"no stars\" is not an option.  This is the exact email I sent to the brewery after leaving this establishment about my \"experience\" which has yet to be acknowledged :  Pretty disappointed by last night's experience. Or lack there of. We got to the brewery a few minutes before what I was told was our \"reservation\" time and just shortly after a party of 4 had gotten there. I heard the host tell the party that since they did not have a ''reservation\", it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. The party moved aside to discuss if they wanted to wait or not. The host then ignored my husband and I for 5 minutes while she conversed with 3 other employees all who seemed to not have a care in the world. When we finally got her attention she found our name on the \"reservation\" list and informed us it would still be at least 30/45 minutes before we could be sat. Now longer than the group who walked in before us that didn't have a \"reservation\". We have no problem over looking minor service issues,especially at a new place, when dining out, but when it comes at the expense of wasting our entire evening, that's just inexcusable. Why bother taking reservations? Scratch that, why email me and ask me if I'd like to have a reservation for your establishment if you have no intention of honoring it. Sure you maybe thinking, \"we were going to honor it, just 45 minutes late\"... Which means it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriving at this imaginary table? Also 30/45 minutes? Lame.   So I have yet to get a response...  Forget this small place with crap parking. Go to Fate, or Angels Trumpet, or Sun Up, or Phoenix Ale House, or Sleepy Dog, or Four Peaks, or Gordon Biersch, or hell, drive the hour to Sedona or Pine and visit one of their many breweries. All of them will be more than happy to provide you with wonderful beer & food with out a \"reservation\"... Just don't bother here."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and food, but service could use improvement. Two different visits yielded day and night waitstaff experiences so it seems more training is in need for more attentive quality and consistency."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service were good.  Out of tasting 7 beers of a flight,  I liked the cream ale and the oatmeal stout. All the other beers were okay but, not really enough flavor to differentiate one from the other. They didn't have the porter on tap, which I was looking forward to trying. I don't know if it was a bad day or I chose the wrong meal but I ordered the small roasted vegetable Flatbread pizza, it had no sauce, was dry,  overcooked. All the awesome veggies listed looked like diced peppers. It was not restaurant worthy. Totinos one dollar grocery store pizza was better. The place has potential with a little work. Not worst place ever but disappointing."}
{"text":"Meh. Bartender is the only reason to come here. She's super friendly and accommodating. I came in here with one purpose. I was informed that 1. They don't support other local breweries and 2. Their employees go out and demand a discount cause they work here. Both are true. It's a community, get over yourself. It's not that great of a product. Will not return."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great food, great brews, awesome atmosphere. Come as you are, a true brewery. It is noisy... So be ready to raise the volume for your conversations, but the noise makes it good for kids as they won't be bothering others. Friendly service... Make a trip here when you get the chance."}
{"text":"Simply AWESOME place. Owners Candy and Rob are very special people who have created a wonderfully special place in Sunnyslope. Be sure to try their C.R.E.E.M. beer - absolutely over the top!"}
{"text":"Went to soft opening and had a blast, and couldn't wait to go back!  Went back a month or so later and took a great friend with me. The beer was VERY good (and the ONLY reason this is 3 stars) but the food was worse! Burger came back WAY over cooked and the size of a sausage patty at $14??? Told the waitress about it and she seemed to be oblivious that I wasn't happy and never brought me another burger, so the manager took care of me. Won't be going for the food, and the service was a joke. Stinks, really good beer, so maybe I will go back, but just for the beer. : P"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say that we have been back since & the service has improved a lot. The beer is delicious, the food is great, and they have tons of TVs! Great for games & music!   Thanks!"}
{"text":"We liked it. We had a good experience. Parking was fun, we drove past and could have sworn that this place was closed untill we found the parking and entrance in the back.  The vibe in cool, liked the long tables and benches, if we lived locally I am sure we would be regulars.   I am unfortunalty not a huge beer fan, my partner is. So secondhandly I give a thumbs up to the beer. The crab dip was on point. The chicken sandwhich was okay. I am sure if we return to Phoenix again we will stop here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love NM Brewing.  It is a great place to chill over some great craft beer and good food. They have the best brussels sprouts side and also roasted cauliflower.  Fish and chips are good as well as Poutine.  Burgers are tasty as well as the steak sandwich.  My husband likes the Shepherd's Pie.  Really I have never had any bad food here.  It's not fine dining but great casual dining that pairs well with the beer.  Their beer menu changes and they are great about giving you a shot glass sample before you choose.  Love the CardinAle -- my go to - while my husband gravitates to either the Pict or the Octomalt.  This is just a family owned casual low-key place.  If you are looking for trendy or creativity this is not your place.  For me it is just right and the reason why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Had heard about this place from a few friends. Decided to give it a try. Overall, our experience was very good.  Started out with a couple of beers. We opted for, sorry can't remember the name, a fruit flavored summer brew. LIght, but refreshing. For dinner we split the fish and chips and an eggplant pizza. I think the fish and chips were better than the pizza, but both were good.  Overall, I was surprised at how nice the place is. Seems like this area needed a good place."}
{"text":"The food and staff are fantastic. Good fresh beer but a bit Meh. Nothing too special about the beer but the food and friendly staff makes up for it. Was better when they had open mic night. Turning a bit too hipster for me. Crowded and far too loud with the band's they book. Screaming at the person sitting next to you suxxx."}
{"text":"We have been to North Mountain a handful of times, the first being the week they opened.  They had the standard \"just opened\" restaurant issues but the beer was good.   A few weeks ago we went and the beer selection was limited- they were out of  some of their beers.  The beer they did have was just OK.  I get that beer takes time and maybe they are still trying to judge volume, but the quality of beer has also gone down hill.   Wanting to really like this place and support business in our neighborhood, we tried it again last night.  Beer is notably worse and they have updated the menus to try and explain why there is an inconsistency and call it \"rotating taps\".  What I got out of this was, \"we can't figure out how to make our beers (listed on the menu) consistently so we will pour whatever comes out of the batch.\"    We have not tried much of the food menu.  But this is a brewery, the beer should be the focus, right?  Oh, forgot to mention our server last night.  She disappeared and we had to go to the bar to get our check.  Luckily one of the servers sitting at the bar knew her employee ID and could print it for us.  They couldn't find her either."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, be patient ,be prepared to wait, good live music makes the wait tolerable."}
{"text":"I have been going to North Mountain for over a year now! I have found Heroes 19 there (the beer to honor the Yarnell Firefighters), and tons of other delicious beers. Current favorite is the Serendipitous! I do wish they would bring back the Bearded Dragon and the Imaginary IPA.  The bartenders and servers have never been anything but the friendliest, and even if I go by myself I always find myself caught up in a nice conversation.   Oh yeah, they have some of the best wings I have ever had! Without hyperbole!  I wish them nothing but the best!"}
{"text":"Right on good spot with great beer and good food.  The menu could use an update, but what they serve is top notch.  Their wings may be the best made.  Who knew Sunnyslope could be so trendy and taste so good."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Friday night. Now, I do not drink beer, I hate beer BUT all of my friends drink it so I goto breweries for support. I was impressed with NMBC, the interior was awesome, I loved seeing the stills and the whole rear wall is doors that open to a patio that were open. Our waiter was kick ass and was the epitome of customer service. There was some great live music going on and it wasn't some horrible hipsters. Now, as I said, I do not drink beer so I had a coke. It took me awhile to read the menu to decide what to eat, everyone raved about the crab dip and said the chicken sandwich and burgers were not worth eating. I decoded to get the all-meat 7\" pizza and damnit, that was a FANTASTIC choice. Though I do not drink beer, I will come back for the atmosphere and the pizza. I gave 5 stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"The beer and food were both amazing! It's not convenient for me but if I ever find myself near here I'll be sure to stop back in for a pint and an app."}
{"text":"Really good food. Table ordered Shepard's pie, Burger, steak sandwich, and fish and chips. Food came out fast and delicious. My only negative, don't order the sangria, they don't know how to make it."}
{"text":"My new favorite brewery. Had a great Hefe and their food was awesome. BBQ pork sliders were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"If you like good food and great beer, try this spot; you won't regret it.  This has become a must visit for me every time I'm out here in AZ.  Right now I'm having the Purplesaurus after killing a pastrami sandwich. Recently, I took a growler of their guava beer back home to CA and everyone liked it. Everything here is just good...trust me."}
{"text":"Recently attended a food/beer pairing event - one of the very best dinner experiences I have EVER had. The brewmaster and head chef visited us before all 8 of the courses, explaining what they had made and why they were pairing them together. It was so personal and thoughtful, and unique and entertaining. Absolutely wonderful event, and we can't wait to go back to NMBC for more beer and food during regular hours!"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband, kids & dog. Service was ok. The kitchen was backed up due to s large party. They were seating people and telling them they could order drinks, no food orders for 20 minutes. The German pretzel appetizer was good. You can order cheese for an additional $1 which we didn't NOT ask for and the waitress gave us and charged us a $1 for, so I deducted a $1 from her tip. I got the Chicken Fundido sandwich which was pretty good, nothing I have to go back & have again though. My husband had the burger with pulled pork on it and said it was below average. I did try the Mead flight and the first 2 were good, the last two...yuck! The outdoor patio is quite small & had poor lighting. It was very hard to see. Overall dining experience was just ok and nothing made me have to go back."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great atmosphere.  Have been here multiple times and it always delivers. The beers are always amazing and the food is the best!! Would highly recommend visiting here. Try the poutine!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: A-  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into North Mountain Brewing Company. When I say pleasantly surprised, I don't mean it in a bad way at all - it's just that the surrounding area could be seen by some as being a bit rough. North Mountain felt very homey to me right away - they were blasting reggae (which is the way to my heart), they had two long communal tables, lighting was nice, and they also had just enough Christmas decorations to feel festive. I loved it. They do a great job of making themselves seem like an oasis in the area they are in. Even though my stop there was relatively quick, it's a place I can see myself just hanging at for hours at a time.  Cleanliness: A  A very clean place. Always a good feeling to have. Sometimes it can be tough for an establishment to feel homey and clean at the same time, but North Mountain did it.  Service: B+  Service was great. When we walked in, a bartender immediately noticed and greeted us, informing myself and my fiance that we could take a seat anywhere and a server would find us. I can't recall our server's name, but she was very attentive and got the timing down very well on when we needed checking up on. My only complaint (if that) on service was when I asked what her favorite beers were on the menu, she simply pointed out two that were the most popular. Most of the time when I ask a server or bartender for a recommendation, I expect a somewhat passionate response as to what they personally enjoy eating/drinking. I didn't get that here.  Food: B-  A first glance the menu seemed to be a bit boring. After a closer look, I did notice they offer a few good spins to traditional bar/brewery food which is nice. We ordered the chicken sandwich and a side of mac 'n cheese. Chicken sandwich came with bacon jam on it which was a nice touch, and the chicken itself was breaded and fried into a perfect crisp. I personally wasn't a fan of the mac 'n cheese - I thought the cheese sauce was too grainy, and it just seemed so orange it looked fake. On the other hand, my fiance loved the mac 'n cheese, so what do I know?  Beer: C  Unfortunately, this is where things go a bit down hill.We ordered a taster of 8 different beers so we could get a good feel for all they had to offer (or at least almost all of it). They were good size tasters, so it was actually a perfect amount to split between two people. I think for the size of them, the price point was good.  It wasn't too expensive. The CardinALE Red was my favorite. It was a well-balanced beer that was super drinkable. My least favorites were the bourbon-barrel aged pumpkin beer, and also the imperial stout. The pumpkin beer had WAY too much bourbon flavor. Part of me can't believe I just typed that (as I'm a huge whiskey fan), but it just didn't fit in this beer. It was very overpowering. Overall, the beers here just didn't stand out to me much  Creativity: C  Between the beer and the food, I felt that the creativity was a bit lacking compared to other breweries. I loved the service and the overall vibe of the place, but again - feel like they could improve with execution on some beers and some creativity on the menu."}
{"text":"We didn't try the food, it looked good though. The beer was fan-tas-tic! My favorite was the Spiral Man Oatmeal Stout my husband likes the CardinAle Red. We highly recommend the North Mountain Brewery!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo much better!  I've now been here several times since my last review and the food/service has gotten much better!"}
{"text":"So I posted a review on here yesterday and was contacted by their Manager/Owner(?) and was told that what I had written was incorrect. I wrote about sour beers and they don't make any sour beers. Yep, totally correct, I mistook this place with another brewery here in Phoenix and I just copied and pasted to that other one. To my knowledge, first time I've ever made this mistake, so....  3 1/2. I came here because I was in the neighborhood and actually tried another craft beer bar but it didn't serve draft beer so I left that place and found this place.  I sat at the bar and ordered a flight of beers, though I only did 6 and not the 8 they offer! Upon recommendation I also ordered the lumpia, which I've never seen on a menu. Well, except at a Filipino place. All the beers are solid and I liked them. I didn't think any beer I had was amazing but I'd definitely come back and drink some more beer. My lumpia was actually way overcooked. The meat inside was literally black inside. I never return food so I didn't say anything.  Well, I struck up a conversation with the gentleman sitting next to me, and he asked me how the lumpia was. So I told him and the bartender overheard me. At this point, I was done with the night and ready to go home so she took away the lumpia. Mind you, I still at about half the plate, maybe a little more, mostly the burnt ones. So when I got the bill she completely removed the lumpia off the bill and only charged me for the beers. That was pretty cool, I honestly wasn't expecting that, though I had every right to say something, but I never do, so it was somewhat serendipity.  So overall I had a pretty good time and I liked the crowd this place attracted. Seemed more the blue-collar type people rather than some of these other craft beer places. Would definitely come back to try more beer and eat other food and adjust my rating appropriately."}
{"text":"Ok, the beers are outstanding, but the poutine is amazing!  Short ribs, braised to perfection.  With gravy.  Over fries and cheese curds (be still, my Wisconsin-girl heart).  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Terrific IPA! Owners Rob and his wife came over to our table. Friendly and welcoming atmosphere reminiscent of  our Portland and other western brewery experiences. Will definitely be back for the beer, atmosphere and pretzel bread!"}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, friendly staff, and just overall a great local place to get a good locally brewed beer.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tuesday was open-mic night; actually good music and made atmosphere just right. Beers are really good. Liked the CREEM and Serendipitous the best."}
{"text":"This place is so good! You can do 6 or 8 4 3/4 oz tasters which is a lot but you can try a variety of their beers. My favorite was the C.R.E.E.M. If you come here, you must try the short rib poutine! All the food we ordered was great (especially for a brewery). Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Great place even for kids."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have good beer especially the Nerotic belgian and the bearded dragon IPA. $5 taco special is the bomb!. Fish and chips are done just right! Jessica is an awesome bartender and can pour a beer like no other! Even though its in Sunnyslope its awesome and has a cool little patio!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and beer. The ambience here is great, as is the service. Our waitress told us this place has been around for five years. I wish we'd come here sooner. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went during the Blue Brews & Arts Fest. It was such a fun festival. Great crowd, beer, and food."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts are amazing, crab dip, pretzel bread. Awesome, good beer, got the burger of the week, the reuben, very good but not enough pastrami to taste it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beers were decent but not memorable. Had the spoiled dove dirty blonde ale and the hefamerica- they were light and crisp which you want on a hot summer day. However, it had the general light beer flavor you can find anywhere, nothing special.  I ordered the north mountain burger medium, it was over cooked and had more bread then burger. The flavor was satisfying and fixed my burger craving. My bf got the crab dip that is advertised to have 'lumps' of crab meat- there was no crab meat and it took forever for him to get his requested sourdough bread for it. The server can back to deliver other items four different times and had to be reminded twice about the sourdough bread. Overall our server seemed to care more about his other tables and barely came over; was hoping to try another beer but gave up because he took so long.  So overall the brewery was okay, service lacking, might go back eventually."}
{"text":"The brews and the chicken sandwich... and all of the appetizers... are sooo good. Definitely worth the trip from the far west valley! We've been here 2 times now and it has been flawless both times."}
{"text":"Came Saturday night. Live music a treat. The Brussels sprouts salad was divine. Fish and chips were average. Fries were thin cut the way I like them. Glasses on the beer flights are 4 or 5 ounces, so be careful if you are driving. Mike the waiter was very entertaining."}
{"text":"Excellent pork sliders which left our mouths watering and pro tip, get their beer samplers of all 12 beers! Nice place and sad that I found it while leaving this place"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while moving last weekend and we all enjoyed our food and beers. My favorite part was their ability to \"nitro-style\" any of their beers. Yum! We'll be back to try more.."}
{"text":"Service was non existent.  Took at least 15 minutes to get my first beer and I was one of 4 people in the whole place :("}
{"text":"Good beer, good place, food is decent could use some work  Most of the time the beer is great! Last time we order one not so great. It was a newly tapped keg of Hefe and it came out looking like mud. Mouth feel was course and grainy. Flavor was off too from all the trub still free floating around. They were friendly and understood and took it off our bill. If this were my brew pub that beer would have never left the bar and ended up in the drain.  I like that they serve their beer in the correct glass style for each beer style. You don't get that much any more because places are lazy and only serve in pints or mugs. YES IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. But if Coors Light is your favorite beer you probably won't understand.  I would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"Visited North Mountain Brewing Company the other night on a whim. (A friend's whim, actually.) It wasn't until I arrived that I realized I had been there once before a couple of years ago to watch a different friend of mine perform live with her band.  I remembered this as I walked up to the entrance and, sure enough, was greeting by the sound of live music playing again as I entered. Being a musician myself, and long-time lover of live music, this was an instant hit for me. I found a seat and got comfortable.  The first time I ever visited North Mountain Brewing Company, I didn't order any food, just a beer. It was so long ago that I can't remember having any impressions of the beer one way or another. I just remember liking the feel of the place.  This time, I was here for dinner. AND a beer. So, as I sat at a small table for two in the very center of the room, surrounded by the sounds of acoustic ambiance, I began to peruse the beer and food menus as if for the very first time.  I was impressed to find so many original beers on the menu. Good ones, too - including the beer that I ordered which was an Imperial Red IPA. YUMM!!! My friend ordered a red ale, which was equally delicious in its own way.  We were helped by a pretty young server named Alisa. She was super helpful and more than willing to answer all our questions. I made a point of getting her name off the receipt so that I could mention her in this review. She was great.  My friend ordered the Fish & Chips, and I ordered the Poutine at Alisa's recommendation. Both entrees were tasty, although not as standout as the beer, in my opinion. I'd rate both entrees a 4 out of 5, but my friend really enjoyed her Fish & Chips.  Overall, the experience was a win. I plan to go back and try more off the food menu. I'm especially excited to go back and try more off the BEER menu. (I drove from North Scottsdale and that alone is worth the trip.)  If you haven't been to North Mountain Brewing Company, I'd recommend it based on my experience there. If you're really lucky, you'll get Alisa as your server. Make it even more interesting and find a time when they're playing live music (they do this often).  Thank you, North Mountain Brewing, for creating some truly enticing beers. (Probably some of my favorite in the Valley currently.) And thank you, Alisa, for such outstanding service. I'll look forward to seeing you all again soon.  :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing to get too excited about. If you are looking for a nice place to enjoy a couple beers and have a bite to eat, you probably won't be disappointed. There is an extensive craft beer menu.  Service was pretty slow. We had to flag down a waitress and ask for our check after 10 minutes of sitting with empty plates and cups."}
{"text":"Never, ever, ever eat the chicken fried steak. I'm not sure if it, or the gravy, were more tasteless. Service was also very lackluster."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night, about happy hour time, but did have dinner.  Place was fairly busy for a Wednesday during June.  They had live music which made it kind of fun.  I am a fan of local craft beer, and this place ranks right up there with the best.  As with any small brewer, the selection can depend on what they have recently made.  Had the amber and the stout, and both were excellent.  The food is typically pub food, and is very good (the kids liked the pretzels so much, we had to order more), but had some interesting twists (the poutine, for example, which was very good).  And the service was very good.  Our waiter was busy with other tables, but was attentive to our needs.    Overall, glad this place is around, and suggest to anyone that like local brew pubs to venture over there."}
{"text":"Glad I finally checked this place out!  The BEST fish n chips in the valley. Zipps used to be my #1. I still think Zipps fries are better but North Mountain has the best fish!  Lots of choices on beer rotating on nine taps. The pretzel bread is so delicious with the honey butter!  The place is super clean, the staff was nice and they have a lovely outdoor patio area. Free life music nightly. Open mike night on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The boys are in town. We are having a good time. Good beer and the lumpia was good and fast. 2nd brewery tonight. Good place to have a large group and with good appetizers and beer. Not the slow service as I had seen in prior posts."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Central Phoenix! They have an ever-changing beer menu and with each change, the beer is getting better and more interesting! I came in for a good local beer and was surprised by the food choices and the quality of the food. This brewery has hit the mark for overall places to visit; great beer, food, and atmosphere! I will be back, and have been back several times."}
{"text":"Beers are pretty good. Food not too good. Why a 2? They charge tax at the bar for a beer. Nobody heard of tavern act or bar1, bar2. Bad form and I am not sure if it is legitimate."}
{"text":"\"LOFTY LOFT\" Industrial ceilings, Long tables, good for sharing n' meeting nice people. First experience was very warming, Michael our server is well informed, I gave him a few of MY recommendations as he is a newbe to our fair State !! Needless to say, We were impressed with him and the delightful menu selection, Didn't do the beer tasting but it looked like fun.  I'll be back :D:D  Sharlene PHX AZ       P.S. Maureen, I did return the Menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for happy hour a few days ago.   Nice space, very big and open. Played good music while we were there, and quite a few large TVs with some hot beach volleyball chicks on. Nice. Bar is a bit small (and full), so we ended up with a table. Our waitress was solid. Good service, never had empty drinks.  Food was OK. Had a burger special, girlfriend had some kind of \"Asian \" sliders. My burger was cooked as ordered, but had zero flavor. Her sliders were far better, but not out of this world. Menu seems to offer a lot, so we'll delve deeper next time.   AZ beers are typically terrible, but the 6 house brews we tried were decent. They seem to produce a lot of varieties, so I'm sure I can find 1-2 that are worth ordering again.   Happy hour pricing is very reasonable.This was a nice find. In striking distance by bike, and an overall good experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Well I need admit this is not my scene. Sharing communal tables with hipsters that drum on them while you trying to have dinner and listening to strange indie bands is not my idea of a good time.  Food was decent, I was not a far of the beers, found one that I could drink. Service was good, but this place is not for me.  The place is packed so if this is your scene come early."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the purplesaurus hefe.  The raspberry fruitiness is wonderful, especially on a hot summer evening.  My husband ordered the southwest burger medium. .. it came out extra well done. This didn't please his palette.  However he drank several beers and enjoyed his time in this rustic/industrial restaurant.  They had a live band playing classic rock. Service was great! I'll be back. Enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I like eating at places that have a relaxed atmosphere, unprotencious service and most importantly, good food. For this place, the food was good, but the atmosphere was great. I liked the blue grass band playing in the background, the quick attentive service and the wide open space that was comfortable. The food was good too... I had the southwestern burger and my husband had their normal burger. We also had brussels sprouts and macaroni and cheese along with the Hefe and Ale.  This place is super close to my house and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Very down to earth.  Awesome beer, that changes all the time. Recommend the brussel sprouts, ahi tuna and the spent grain cookie is crazy good."}
{"text":"North Mountain has definitely hit its stride--vibe is good, live music some nights and the food just keeps getting better.  Had the poutine  recently--it was great and the fries were crispy.  Beer continues to be great for people with all tastes and level of beer knowledge."}
{"text":"First visit: Good food. Good beer. Kind of a sketchy neighborhood. Decent service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One  of my tops place to eat, my husbands and sons best place for draft beers! My fav appetizer, lumpias."}
{"text":"Met some friends and family here for lunch on a Sunday.  Wasn't too busy and the atmosphere was comfortable.  The bar was lined with fans watching football games on the televisions, a few small groups were scattered around the room talking and outside a couple guys were smoking pipes, which smelled great.  Very relaxed.  Our server checked in regularly and gave generous samples of the beers we were interested in trying.  The brewery's own beers were very good.  Food was great.  The pretzel rolls with beer cheese and house mustard were average, but the daily special soup, a green chile and potato mixup, tasted exceptional, despite being very bland visually.  The sausage platter was delicious and came with generous portions of sausages cooked to perfection.  My wife had the waffle and enjoyed it.  Their beef sandwich was very much Philli-style and, although not nearly as good as a real-deal cheesesteak, it was tasty and filling.  The price of food and appetizers are a bit on the high side, which is my only major complaint, if I had to have one.  Beers had a wide range of prices, but were generally decent and the limited, but well diversified selection was nice.  I plan to visit North Mountain Brewing Co. again very soon.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place with good microbrews and really good food.  I had the steak sandwich the first time and it was like a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  They use blue cheese on the sandwich which tasted really good.  The 2nd time I had the Poutine which is a very unique dish.  I guess it is a Canadian dish but I never had it before.  It was really good and it only cost $12.  It is french fries topped with short rib, cheese curds, and gravy.  It is a really hearty dish and you get a lot for the money.  I really think they could charge a lot more for this dish.  The short ribs melt in your mouth!  They had some live acoustic music on Friday which was nice and they played some good classic rock songs.  This won't be the last time I go here, I really like this place.  09/24/15 the Poutine portion was smaller then the last time I had it, about half the amount of short rib."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Sunny Slope. Stopped in for the first time last week with coworkers from out of town. The Beer and food was great. Had a small mistake with splitting the charges over different credit cards. The staff and owner bent over backwards to correct the mistakes. North Mountain Brewing Co is now number 2 for me in the Sunny Slope area. (Sorry but Corbins is still my favorite)."}
{"text":"Beers r just okay for a micro brewery and prices r on high side.  Service was good and friendly staff.  Great potential but just not there yet."}
{"text":"Here's what we had at about 3:30 in the afternoon.  No one but maybe 2 people in the whole place. Which is understandable on a weekday.  Tried the lumpia egg rolls which would probably have been great if the oil wasn't dirty oil and they were not over done on the outside. My buddy had the fish fry which is Alaskan cod but there was an immense amount of breading on it and for 3 pieces and shoe string fries not worth the cost and I had the poutine which was delicious however it wasn't a lot of beef ( they put beef and cheese curd over French fries with a gravy ) as for beers or anything I can't include those cuz neither my friend nor I drink . We just thought that the menu looked appealing. The beers looked ( according to description) pretty tasty but the food ( or at least the fryer oil should have been cleaned) probably won't be back"}
{"text":"This should be your go-to if you're looking for a local beer experience.  I'm not a beer person but their hefe is out of this world.  I actually drank the entire thing which is RARE for me.  (I usually drink about half.  Doesn't matter the size - I just want half.)    The food was delicious.  The burger special abomination was a burger topped with an onion ring, mac n' cheese, short ribs and unicorn sprinkles - happy tummies at the table.  My poutine was delicious - my only complaint about it (and this super picky) is that the curds were melted.  But, that is a small price to pay for rich gravy and potato-y goodness.    Desserts are another category entirely.  The grain cookie is just stupid.  The husband makes beer and has made some wonderful dense dark breads out of spent grain.  I didn't think a cookie was possible but it is - it's reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and topped with ice cream and served WARM... you're welcome.  We also got the malt which was tasty but I'd choose the cookie again in a heartbeat.    This joint isn't even remotely in our neighborhood but we'll be comin' back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening at approx. 8:30 pm for a brew and some food.  It was not busy - in fact there was an abundance of seats available on the inside.  We sat outside, ordered a beer and our food.  The beer was good and delivered promptly.  We order a burger and pizza and proceeded to wait for over 45 minutes for our food. The server did come back several times to tell us there were several large orders in front of us.  There were barely 30 people total on the inside and there were 3 cooks working the kitchen.  We were just getting ready to ask for our check for the beers and leave when she brought the food out.  The only thing that saved the evening was the food was good and the server was very friendly and apologetic about the long wait.  Not sure I would go back here for food, but the beer was (Hefe) was good."}
{"text":"LUMPIA!  Okay, why lumpia hasn't caught on mystifies me.  These tasty Filipino pork and veggie egg rolls are amazing.  NMBC offers a generous serving as an appetizer with two sauces.  The peanut sauce is all you need, though.  Also tried the pretzel bread.  Hot and tasty with the right amount of chewiness.  A honey cinnamon butter, cheese sauce and spiced mustard came for dipping the pretzels.  Had the CardinAle Red, which was very smooth and flavorful.  Entrees were good, too.  But, seriously, go for the lumpia!"}
{"text":"News flash St. Patrick's day is a \"drinking\" holiday. Being told it will be a hour for food but then ignored for that hour is unacceptable! Left after 45mins of receiving our flight with no service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great beer. Great atmosphere for the neighborhood and a good deal. Napkins need upgrading."}
{"text":"They have 12 types of local beer there. In addition there is a great system to enjoy many beer at the same time by flights, they have 6 beer flight and 8 beer flight. I really enjoyed drinking many types of beer there.  Also their foods were appropriate saltiness so really good. But I would like to recommend this restaurant to add flight glasses because of their limitations to serve flights to many customers. At least my friends and I were waiting for next serve repeatedly."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and everything we've had is so delicious. My husband had ordered the sausage platter twice, our kids have had the burger, cheese pizza and Mac and cheese, I've had the fish and chips and the Shepherd's pie and omg, it's my favorite so far. Oh and the Crab dip and Poutine are too... Ok, I can't pick a favorite because they're all so good. Service is awesome with super, super friendly staff. They've totally made a regular customer out of us. Can't review their beers because none of us are beer drinkers but everyone else in the restaurant seems to be enjoying theirs, so they must be really good. If you don't like beer, definitely go for the food! :-)"}
{"text":"Wow..unexpected goodness. Lumpias!!  Take a hike then stop in for cold beer and  great food."}
{"text":"This brewery has a great vibe inside along with a large food menu. I was impressed with the number of beers they have on tap. You can get a flight of 6 or 8 that are just under 5oz pours for $12-15 ($2 off if you're there during happy hour) which I find to be a great value. I wasn't overly impressed with any of their beers in particular, but loved the atmosphere and will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Group of 6 (plus baby which was just fine) just enjoyed a birthday celebration at North Mountain. With numerous people in our group very critical towards beer there was a level of quality we all expected, and to say the least it was matched. Impressive diversity of beers combined with unique cask options (we tried one from a tequila barrel). Combine this with great food ( must try the poutine) we will be back without a doubt! Check it out..."}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening as well as last nights grand opening and the servers, chef and staff were great given the overwheing customers that came. Food was delicious and the beers were great. I don't know why people would complain about the wait which was not bad 30 min wait is average even at ie Red Lobster,Macaroni Grill for a Friday or Saturday night heck given that this is North Mountain Brewery opening weekend the wait was a breeze. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a place that is still growing.  I learned a little from the marketing director for NMB; their roots are in home brew.  Like many microbrew start-ups, they are learning how to be a restaurant along with making craft beer.  I believe they will get better at this so I cut them a break when it come to the food/service side.  That being said my server was great - very responsive with quick service.  The beer was off-the-hook fantastic.  This is a family operation so it will be exciting to watch it grow.  I think they have their heart in the right place so if you have any problems, please give them constructive pointers; but if you do, make sure you give a holistic view with not only the misses but the hits.  Candy, I will be back."}
{"text":"Not having poutine before, I'm addicted now!   I'm not sure how it could be better.  And the brussel sprouts were a great pairing.  Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was delicious and the beers were just as amazing. We tried the Justin, Mountain Burger, Oysters, Lumpia (FAVORITE), and the Shepards pie; none of which disappointed and was like a party for my taste buds. Will be for sure frequenting this place when I next visit Phoenix from LA."}
{"text":"I've been three times and not once have I been impressed by the beer. It wasn't very cold, it went warm within minutes, and didn't sit well with me. The stout is the only one I'd ever order again.   Each time I've gone, I've had a flight of every beer that I hadn't already tried. The flight of 6 is $14! I didn't even end up drinking more than 1 full taster. Keep in mind these are a little bit larger than normal tasters. I should have had the mead flight instead.   Never mind the high price of the flight, the food is outrageously expensive for a brewery. I couldn't get even a side to snack on for less than $7. They have a great quality menu, I don't doubt that, but it's not budget friendly by any means and the beer price certainly doesn't make up for it. I haven't walked out under $20 for a quick bite/beer stop once.   The bartenders aren't the friendliest. Last time I asked for a beer menu and she pointed to the wall and walked away. Then her friends, or regulars rather, walked in to sit at the bar and they asked for one and she handed it right to them. They were also asked for beers before I was as well.   The waitresses gossip at the end of the bar  while waiting for their drinks very loudly about how annoying their customers were being. It went something like, \"Table x over there is so annoying, she wanted x with a side of x and I thought, you're so stupid!\" It was just catty and unnecessary. I wouldn't mention this because I vent about my customers too once in a while, but it's happened all three times I've been here with different girls on different days. Not cool."}
{"text":"Seriously, drove all the way from Los Angeles and this was our very first meal in good ole Arizona!!! Came to AZ for the Phoenix Open and this place is absolutely delicious!! The staff is super friendly and I LOVE their poutine!!!!  P.S. Added #Bacon for that extra fee!!!! #NoProblems #Yum"}
{"text":"Ok people... Take a breath and reign in your inner bitch. This is the FIRST couple days of what will be a jewel of the neighborhood. Just like any new neighbor having guests over for the first time, your job as a guest is to welcome them first... Hold back on your criticism as if they owe you something because they we're blessed by your company. First impressions? Yes, the 4$ valet is not in line with the neighborhood norms. Adjust. Yea, live music! Live music by the front door?! Maybe not... Also, put up some artwork or other stuff to breakup the bare wall space. Ok... That's it. Nothing else to crab about cuz I was here two days in a row and I'm ready to go back tonight. The food was GREAT. Good portions, better than I make at home, and less than it would cost to make/burn myself. Great beers too! The one I disliked most is still delicious! How often can you say that?! Plus, I enjoy that it's not \"service\" so much as a bunch of people who like to cook and serve food and beer, hanging out with their neighbors. Like contributing to a pot luck with cash instead of potato salad. Don't get lost in the expectations of what you are buying with your dollar. Come, sit, eat, drink, listen, meet, share, taste, smell, speak, thank and ENJOY your neighbors and your neighborhood! ;) You can thank me later... Cheers!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was last year just a few months after they opened.  We were a big group for lunch and we had a pretty good time.  I don't remember what I had then, but I liked their beer.  Last Friday I went again for a UYE.  Our server was fabulous, really nice,  I like light beers, but with a little taste, not bitter.  He let me sample a couple he suggested and our host let me taste the Hefe Endings, which is the one I was eyeing.  I ended up with the Hefe.  My husband and I shared the southwest burger, we usually do that because most burgers lately are so gigantic and I don't need that many calories, don't get me wrong, I can finish it, I am just trying to be a little more conscious now that my metabolism is not as it used to be.  Well this burger is not that big.  It is pretty tasty and spicy (in a good way if you like spicy), but is not gigantic, its average size and I needed something extra, so my husband asked for the asian pulled pork sliders.  Not my favorite.  I am glad they are small and I had one, my husband could take the rest.  The ambiance is really nice and since we had a great group, I had a very good time."}
{"text":"North Mountain Brewing was the second stop on the Brews Cruise UYE. Just from setting up a reservation for us, I could tell we were in for an awesome time!  I called in to reserve a table for our expected group of 18. I was worried I'd have to reschedule or have us at different tables when the hostess told me there was already a bigger group reservation for that same time. But she told me she'd have the manager Candy call me back to see what we could do.   Candy was quick to get back to me and not only was she more than accommodating to having both groups there, she even managed to set us up in a single table so we didn't have to be separated! She went way above and beyond to make this happen and I owe her a huge thank you!  I also want to thank our server Chris. He had the daunting task of taking care of all of us and did an amazing job.   The brewery itself was amazing. Great decor that included art pieces from local artists in a wide open dining area. There's enough screens in there for anyone to come in to watch the game over some brews.  Meg and I both shared an order of Lumpia and Poutine for dinner. The Lumpia was fantastic! Very flavorful and crispy with plenty to share between four people. The Poutine with braised short ribs and cheese curds is probably the best I have ever had. Very tender short ribs and gobs of cheese on a huge plate of fries. I also got to sample the crab dip which was awesomely buttery and creamy. Fantastic all around.  And then there was the extensive amount of brews. North Mountain has 12 different beers with a little bit of everything. I ordered a large sample and of the 8 I tried, my favorites were the Ryder of Broyhan and Barrel Aged CardinAle Red.   All in all, North Mountain Brewing Company was amazing. Great service, great food, and great beers. I cant wait to come out here again."}
{"text":"Brussel Sprouts with Fresno Peppers and Cotija Cheese is very good!! I had a great dark Beer (Saison) and the grilled shrimp. Perfect combo for middle of the week."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & great beer but it took 45 minutes to get our food. When I walked in I was immediately impressed. Crowded restaurant on a Friday night, a great sign. There was a guitarist playing & the place was buzzing. The waitress recommended getting the beer sampler & I wasn't disappointed. The Dirty Blonde Ale & the Heffeweisen in particular were fantastic. When my friend arrived we ordered food & begin to chit chat & have a good time. After about a half hour we began to wonder where our food was. When the waitress started to avoid us we knew something was wrong. Finally after 45 minutes our food arrived.  My burger was decent but a little dry; it certainly wasn't the medium rare that I had ordered & it was definitely not worth the wait but after 45 minutes and some beer sampler I really needed some food. The waitress said they were unexpectedly busy. I may give them another chance just to see if she was right or if they've worked out their kitchen issues....& to try the beer again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't been back here in so long but I am definitely going to try and come more often.  It was nice to see that business is still booming and they seem to have found their niche.  I love that although it looks like a bar inside it has so much more to offer than your traditional, deep fried bar food.  We started with our favorite, the lumpia Philippine spring rolls and then decided on a yummy wedge salad.  We landed up splitting a bowl of amazing roasted brussel sprouts mixed with cojita cheese.  But they know what they do best and that is brew beer.  The service has gone from weak to wonderful.  I'm glad to see they are going to be around for awhile."}
{"text":"I have only been here on my own, so I sit at the bar. I have always, always found excellent conversation with who ever else was also there. (They have always touted the virtues of NMB.) I also always get some variation of the flight. Sometimes I order food, but usually I do not. The atmosphere is excellent and casual. There is a small patio on the street. The owner(s) are actively involved--at least one is always around."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere. You can actually hear the people around you talk, even at the bar, which is a welcome change. They have some quality beer, mead, and wine, and the best part is they're willing to let you sample it before you commit to buying a glass. If you like spirits, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The server was excellent. We told him the type of beers we generally liked and he gave us suggestions and samples so that we got exactly what we wanted. Our water glasses were kept full. When we started taking about  food, he was very helpful with our selections. They seem to have healthy choice options but we stuck with the deep fried lumpia and poutine which were both excellent. Small patio and more community seating. We sat at a private table. Acoustic entertainment. We could still have a conversation.  We will go back!  Bathrooms were clean"}
{"text":"What is that you say!? Another new brewery in Phoenix!? Why yes it is!!! And its another great one. And on top of that, its not that far away from home.   I am made to think that this building use to be some kind of auto-shop. They had the one of the 2 big garage doors open to the outside last Saturday night. The place was decked out with Halloween d√©cor, along with all the servers and bartenders. They had a kind of open Mic Night that I think they do quiet often with some very good performers.   The beer was tasty! I had the Peches Et Cr√®me . Their lightest brew but still had flavor. A hint of honey and fruit with a creamy finish. I decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and I subbed my French fries for the seafood chowder (best idea ever, I highly recommend doing so. Although my husbands shoestring fries were yummy as well.) This sandwich was ok. Nothing special. Not even the \"Bacon Jam.\" I couldn't really taste it. The bun was soft, the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Your average chicken sandwich. I tried a few bites of my husbands Steak Sandwich. Now this sandwich was very flavorful and man was it spicy. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! If you aren't scared of a little heat, you should definitely give this one ago with a nice cold beer to cool you down. And the Chowder that I substituted. Oh man... I was kicking myself the next day for not getting some to-go for lunch.  I really liked this brewery and I will be back to try some different beer's and food items. And to get some of that chowder before it's gone!"}
{"text":"Really like this quaint little brewery, not in the greatest part of Phoenix but it is a great little diamond. Great beer, the burgers are fantastic all food that I tried was really good. I would highly recommend the pumpkin ale."}
{"text":"Cool, new brewery in North Phoenix.  Pretty simple decor, lively atmosphere with live music, pretty good brew and friendly bartenders.  Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Well, I dug this one up not paying attention that we had already tried it one time and i checked in. Whoops. But we couldn't remember if we liked it or not so we figured why not. Well. I remember why we didn't add it to our  list of must go backs. It's not bad, but it's just not amazing. We have been pretty spoiled with awesome restaurants when we visit so I might be starting to raise my bar on stars here. And again, nothing wrong here, just nothing I would tell someone to go try it. And maybe it's because we aren't beer people."}
{"text":"We visited here on a Saturday night. Tried the beer flight and liked half of them. The hefe was especially good. Also really enjoyed the sangria. Ordered the ploughman's platter appetizer - not worth the money, except for the bacon jelly. Yum!  Husband loved the fries that came with the steak sandwich. I had the Brussels sprouts salad-awesome flavors.   Splurged and had the pazuky for dessert - unexpected textures that really worked.  The live music was an added bonus. We will be back !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, food is wonderful and the variety of beers is good. One of the best parts of North Mountain Brewing Co.is service. All the servers are great. They are very friendly, courteous and make eating there a great time. My fianc√© and I have eaten there many times and we think of North Mountain Brewing Co. as our place, thanks to the way we are always treated when we go there. For good food and just a great time out, North Mountain Brewing Co. is the place to go."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I REALLY want this place to work. I sincerely hope I am able to give a higher rating next time I go back.  First, how in the world does a brewery run out of beer???? This should NEVER happen. The only beers they had available were IPA and Stout, neither of which I like. I realize they are new, but this is like Denny's running out of eggs. When the waitress, Amy (who was very sweet, might I add), realized we were very disappointed that they were out of the Hefe and Pale Ale (amongst others), I think she could have sent the manager/owner over to buy a round - or to simply apologize. I realize they are new, but there is NO way they are going to survive if they run out of beer.  My husband ordered the short ribs which he really liked.  I had the vegetarian because I love eggplant although I am not a vegetarian. The flavor was really good, but it needed more veggies - peppers, mushrooms, onions. It was a chopped up eggplant sandwich with arugula and sauce. The end.  The one-man band was great, and the openness of the space was fantastic. The big downfall of the decor are the BRIGHT lights. They are blinding, so don't look directly into them.   Like I said, I really hope I am able to give this place a five star next time I go. I live right down the street so would love a local brewery to bike to! PLEASE, make enough beer for your patrons. After all, you are calling yourself a \"brewery\". In my opinion, you are not this with three beers to choose from!!"}
{"text":"We live in the southern end of the valley, so this was only our second visit to this gem of a brewery. It was a quiet early afternoon and once again we were delighted by the selection & quality of the beers. I'm slowly becoming a pumpkin frantic. N. MTN is the best I've had to date. The wife blended the Baby Belgium with the Saison  - lovely combo of clove & touch of banana. The highlight though was Mike the bartender. What a joy to chat with the man. He even bought us our drinks. I felt like we had found home. Maybe Phoenix does have a soul after all. We really need to try the food next time. Long live N Mountain Brewery!"}
{"text":"I had the Hefe-Ending beer, it was so smooth and tasted amazing. We also got dinner and loved everything.  The fried mac n cheese appetizer is a must!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the kale salad followed by a spent grain cookie!  Neighborhood hang out.  Good ambiance, excellent food and I am told their beer is very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fantastic and they use products that are local. The beer... the beer is awesome! I find any excuse I can to come here and you should too!"}
{"text":"It was good of the owner to comment on my post. They mentioned we stayed for another hour....yes waiting for our next beer and an order of putine for my brother. I did have to hunt the manager/owner(?) down. She did not find me. I understand they were slammed. We were polite and tried to have a good time anyway. The beer and putine were eventually served after I actually went BACK to the owner and complained after a LONG wait (during which our beers weren't served to us). I don't hold any ill will against the establishment, but I won't be returning. I WILL also tell of my experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We had an appetizer to start - lumpia - and the sauces were complimentary to the flavor. Yum.  Our group had the sausage plate, grilled cheese with bacon and chilled tomato soup and salad with shrimp. All were excellent. Loved it.  We will be back next trip out to AZ."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good.  Service was great. Steak sandwich-terrible. And per waitresses recommendation it was better than the burger. Soooo, not sure what the burger would taste like. The crab dip was pretty good, real blue cheesy, no taste of crab though."}
{"text":"Beers are fantastic variety & great full flavors. All meat pizza was so tasty & fresh!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in North Phoenix, not only is the food exceptional, but also the beer AND DESSERTS!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was great. The beer was great, and cold. The service by Bernie was fantastic.  Loved the spice in the pizza sauce. The Lumpia was great.  Everything here is hand made.  Wife was not a fan of the music selection."}
{"text":"Great time at NM Brewing last nigh.  Service was fast and friendly, owner stopped by to see how we were doing.  Music was a nice touch.  Had the Ipacious IPA.  Good local craft beer.  No noticeable aroma, and much darker than any IPA should be, it is a Pale Ale after all?  But a great taste with a bitter bite.  The Pale Ale while again had very little aroma, was still a very good beer.  We had the great pretzels.  Everything they were talked up to be!  Also had the wings and the flatbread pizza.  The wings were tasty, but a bit under cooked, although blackened on the outside.  The flatbread also came out a bit over cooked.  The flatbread could serve 2-4 people, much bigger than expected.  We be back!  A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great experience! It's open and inviting, and the staff was very friendly. The poutin was very good and way more food than one person can eat (in my opinion). The piece if cake was AMAZING! We also got to try the malt- again really, really good. Desserts are an afterthought at some restaurants, but not here. Beer was more of a 3.5 stars, but it was satisfying. I would say only downside is no full bar and no other beers besides theirs."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the surrounding neighborhood. The North Mountain Brewery is a great place to relax and have a local beer. Friendly staff with a warm atmosphere. The brewery also has a great selection of burgers, salads, grilled cheese, and more! Best for groups of 2 to 6."}
{"text":"Found this place on a quick trip to Phoenix. Service was excellent, food was great! Megan was awesome helping with our beer selections and even gave us some tips on stuff to do in the area with our teenagers!"}
{"text":"Not only is Anthony a world class bar tending connoisseur he also gave me a free coster when I would have paid at least $5 after my clumsy friend spilled beer all over my lap. He spilled his beer because the taste of the amazing beer at North Mountain Brewery was too much for my friend to handle."}
{"text":"Tried a beer sampler here, had a nice and dried selection to choose from. Service was good and friendly. Would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This place was a really fun find! We did an 8 beer flight (which is a super good deal), and loved a bunch of them. The food is overpriced, but the burgers were really good. I liked the atmosphere too! We'll definitely come back here to drink again :)"}
{"text":"A gastro pub is still a pub, sandwiches, pizza and fired food. Maybe there is a bit of flair to make it \"gastro\" however the end result is the same.  Come for the brewing part and order food when you get hungry. The Fish and chips were decent but nothing to come here for. The Thai pizza had a odd sweet sauce but the hot spices redeemed it.  As for the beer my porter was quite good."}
{"text":"fun local brew pub with outstanding beer, great bar food and good music. Often local musicians play in the evening. Smoking patio and a nice size private room if your having a meeting. Great local pub."}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood brewpub.  Phoenix needs more like it.  The food is very good and the brews are well done.  It's a little tucked away and hard to find the first time you visit, but the fare is good enough to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with the girlfriend. We parked in the back and being the nosy guy that I am I walked into the back of the brew house and started chatting with a guy named Omar. He was super inviting and hospitable. He chatted with us about the brewery, the beers and even walked us through the brew house showing us the fermenters, brew kettle, mash tun, etc. I thought it was super cool.   I had a beer that I believe was a Belgian wit and my girlfriend had their stout that was 12.3% which made me happy because she only had one. I didn't like the stout but she did. I loved my beer. We had the Chicago dog and chicken wings. Both were amazing!   We will definitely be back again to help support another awesome local brewery and business!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night on a recommendation from my sister and her boyfriend. They said the beer was really great, and they were right! (It's also not too far from Castles N' Coasters, which makes it a good place to go for dinner before putt-putt golf as a cute little date night ;))   To start, we decided to share a beer flight, so we got four beers each - for only $15! I wish I could remember exactly which ones we tried, but I do know that the Spiral Man Oatmeal Stout was by far my favorite! If you're into stouts, especially the coffee, oatmeal or chocolate-type ones, I think you'll really enjoy this one as well.   We also had the Pretzel Bread appetizer, and that was delicious. I thought the House Mustard was very good, better than the average mustard you get with pretzels. The honey butter was also great, and normally I don't even like sweet stuff on pretzels. (Since I'm not used to liking things like that, I kind of just forgot about it and only used it once, and that was a mistake lol). We also got the cheese sauce for $1 extra. The waiter told us it was worth the extra dollar and he was right! It was way too salty though; we both had to scrape most of the salt off. I would recommend asking for it with light or no salt!  For dinner with both got the Fish & Chips. My boyfriend thought they were pretty good, but me not so much. Mine were kinda soggy and just pretty average overall. The fries were fairly average as well, but the remoulade they come with instead of tartar sauce was yummy!   I'm not sure we would rush back here for the food, but we'll definitely be back for the beer :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in with two of my family members over the holidays for a couple of beers. Meghan our server seem to be put out that we weren't going to eat. She came off as very dismissive and rude.  A real shame since it's close to our house in North/Central PHX and there are no other brewpubs in the immediate area. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite mix of beers, but enjoyed the Imperial Red and the Belay Double IPA. The food is generally good, but $8 for a small side of Mac and chees is a bit steep for what you get. Tasty, but really small serving. Small outdoor patio. Interior cool and spacious. $1 off drafts open to 6:00 pm Monday thru Friday."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! My husband and I had the shepards pie, mussels, and the little eggrolls. I was a little hesitant about the oxtail, but it was a wonderful surprise.  My husband tried the James Brown Ale and wished he wold have gotten a growler of it. The hefe was my favorite.   All the people seemed very nice. The waitstaff, the hostess, and the people who cleared our table. I hope this place stays around for a long time! It was much needed!"}
{"text":"Excellent ales.  I really like that they almost always have at least 1-2 new things on tap every time we go.  On our last visit, we got stuck on the C.R.E.E.M. and the Caber Toss Scottish Dark.  Both are extremely tasty (assuming you like those styles).  The food is definitely above par for a pub.  The lumpia and the brussel sprouts are fantastic!"}
{"text":"So went back here again last night and ordered the Mac & Cheese; it was gooey with nice flavors. Many of my friends ordered food as well and all seems to enjoy their meals. I got to snack on some of my friends thin crispy fries that were yummy too. May have to make this a regular place :)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were both tasty! Excited to go back and try something else off the menu!"}
{"text":"Was at the brewery for the first time today I will not be going back. It was the blues festival I understand it was very busy but the bar was understaffed and me and my friend waited over 30 minutes for a refill on our beer. Not only was the service very slow the girl behind the bar acted like I was really inconveniencing her by asking for a beer. Then we met more friends and moved to a table the food was good but again the waitress was very snarky."}
{"text":"Alright, it's Friday night I live in North Phoenix and I have a dog with separation anxiety but I desperately need a beer so I take my search to Yelp. After reading through 10 different places we decide on North Mountain Brewing. We get a spot on the small four table patio and are immediately greeted by our friendly waitress. I order a flight of beer to start. ($12 for 6 flights with a surprising $4 upcharge ) anyway I thought I was there for the beer but OMG THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! We got the side Mac n cheese, the Lumpia, and the BBQ Pork Sliders. The pork sliders were AMAZING too bad it was 3 little guys for $11 but who am I kidding I'll get them again. Everything was delicious for a \"splurge\" night for my boyfriend and I. We will be returning. My favorite beer was the belay double IPA. I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Nice to have a new brewery in the neighborhood. I will give them a break, they have not been open long. The food was average to good. Staff seemed a bit disorganized, service was average. i will go back, wanna see if they iron out some of the mdeocrity. This place has great potential and I hope it helps to revitalize the neighborhood around it."}
{"text":"We have been living around the corner from this place for months and just found it!!  We have been missing out!  Almost walking distance from our place, great food, great beer, very good service!!  Can't ask for more, they have a new customer for life on us!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 420pm. The place opened at 4pm however you couldnt order food until 5pm or there after. Which seemed strange, dont you think that as soon as you open the kitchen should be ready to go?    I had a bad feeling when seeing that the place was packed and the Kitchen was going to crash.  I was right, it Crashed!! because 90% of the people ordered food all at once. It took forever to get our food, and when it arrived not eveything came out. It happened to all the other tables around us. The fries were luke warm and boy did they scrimp on the portions.  It seemed that they \"stood at the door\" and threw just a handful to the plate with the fish!!  One of our friends didnt even get his Fish and Chips, apparently was taken to the wrong table. I think their portions should be bigger and its misleading when on the menu it says \"Large Plates\", because you expect a big plate of food.  That certainly was not the case.   It seemed liked they really were not prepared. They were disorganised, lack of training and communication.  Servers not knowing the correct table numbers therefore delivering wrong food. A big cluster!!!  The Chef should pre shift the servers before opening letting them know what they didnt have on the menu. Our server came back to us twice because what we had ordered they did not have.   Would also recommend Salt,Pepper,Sauce Caddy's on the tables. Napkins and Clean Polished Siverware would be nice. We had to ask for all that.    Other than that the place had a good atmosphere, the beer tasted great.  Would like to see this place to be sucessfulI, however they will need to  improve with service and food.   Maybe we will come back in a few weeks to give them another chance and hope they have worked out these issues."}
{"text":"I like almost everything about NMBC.  I have been in maybe a couple dozen times, and have tasted just about every brew so far.  Many varieties are a little hoppy for my taste, but I really have enjoyed the hefes, the N'erotic Belgian, and others.  The food is also very good, with the grilled cheese, brussel-sprout salad, burgers and crab dip being my favorites.  As for the service, each time I have been there it has been excellent, with a friendly staff whether sitting at bar or table.  A fun and casual atmosphere, and a great addition to the Sunnyslope area, is NMBC.  I said I like almost everything:  I really liked sitting at the bar a lot more before the TVs were installed.  Now there is no place to sit without that distraction except the patio, and it's not quite cool enough during the day yet.  Do you really need that many TVs in one room?   Also, it's great to have live music, but the lack of a sound system is a major drag.  Finally, I appreciate the notifications about the radio broadcasts - so I can plan my visits to avoid them.   I really like the brews, the food and the service, and I've met a number of nice folks at the bar.  The \"entertainment\" I can do without.  I will continue to enjoy the beers and the food - just have to come in earlier in the day."}
{"text":"So we went on opening weekend and we had a fairly large party of 8 of us so we knew there were be issues so I am going to try this place again in a month or so and hopefully they've worked out the kinks. There were some really good hits and a couple of really bad misses.  First the good hits. The Brussels sprouts are awesome! While the pretzel bread was good the three sauces that came with it were the bomb! My only complaint was there was not enough of them in the little cups. My wife loved the crab dip and the mussels. The burgers were good but needed bacon. We were told after we had eaten that it could be added but no one mentioned it to us and it wasn't on the menu. The servers were very friendly and apologetic on some of the misses. The beer was good. Not great but not bad. I tried the Hefe and the Pale Ale.  So the misses. And these were pretty big misses.  I was the first person to get my plate and my fries were ice cold. Totally inedible! Between the time I got my plate and the last person on our table got his plate was more than 10 minutes. I was done with my meal completely by the time the last person started digging in. The Mac and Cheese, had no cheese on it at all. It was just bland noodles with what  were supposed to be peas in it but I only saw maybe 2 peas. They should just take this off the menu!!! It was by the far the worst thing we ate!  My other complaint is really kind of my own. The place seems to be a geared towards a seafood menu. Out of our entire party, only two people liked seafood. When I think beer, I think burgers and meat and manly food. When I think seafood I think wine. Maybe that is what the owner is looking to change, but with only just 3 or 4 things on the menu not seafood I think they are doing a disservice.  Overall, there are a dozen other brewhouses in Phoenix that serve fantastic food and fantastic beer. I really hope North Mountain Brewing gets their act together, there is nothing on that side of town and it could use it! I will be back in a month or so to see if they can get things together. I think their hits outweigh their misses so go and enjoy a beer, just don't go with a large party. And stay away from the Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"What a great place for a nice dinner and some live music. We started with the crab dip and it did not disappoint. I got a burger, it was pretty good. The winner was my son's chicken strips. They were so tasty! Usually, chicken strips from the kids menu are bland and greasy, not here. I think I'm going to order off the kid menu next time. The only thing I didn't like was the over abundance of fries. The fries were really good too but they just give way to many. I guess that's a good thing for people who have had a little too much to drink."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, Great Ambiance. Now for the bad part. The service is kinda clunky. I hope they fix/make it more seamless. For example - it shouldnt take 30+++ minutes for me to get 2 oysters,  they are in the fridge, go back there and get them, no need to have the chef get them??  This is not rocket science, you are getting a bowl, filling it with ice, cracking open the oysters, sticking them in the bowl, with a few condiments. Same for the soft pretzel that took 45 minutes...seriously people, the waitress or \"cook\" could be doing some of this while the sous chef make the main meals...to put this into perspective when we go there they had 15 people there max, but it took 45 minutes for pretzels.....over an hour for the meal, 30++ minutes for TWO oysters???  This is a great little neighborhood brewery and I am excited that it is here in sunny slope but work out those kinks people!"}
{"text":"Their beer is very tasty! The purplesaurus hef was fruity and light and delicious! The pretzel bread app was soooo good! The bread is nice and salty and soft and the mustard is amazing."}
{"text":"I love their spin on poutine! Decently priced, good atmosphere, good stuff!"}
{"text":"4 stars for these following reasons... Our server Omar was very attentive and nice.  The pretzels and lumpia were tasty. The IPA is great! The food is delicious :)  All in all I would have to say it was the best service and food that we've had a \"legit brewery\" (not a pub or restaurant) besides bar nuts, popcorn or chips as our only options :) got a growler to add to our collection!"}
{"text":"They only serve beers that they brew in house. We tried a few different beers and all were delicious. The food was good but nothing to write home about. The service was prompt, friendly, and personable."}
{"text":"Fresh beer selection, great flavor a and Variety of beers- they have more than just IPAs ! Great food - asparagus and prosciutto pizza is delicious ! They also have great brunch! Servers are knowledgeable of the entire menu and beer selection. Small patio but lots of inside seating ... Wish they had some live music or a larger patio!"}
{"text":"Awesome black IPA and a solid ruben sammich. Keep this one on the list if you're into checking out the Phoenix brew scene. I was in for lunch, the place was empty and the service was fast. I'd bet it gets pretty busy at night for dinner or afterwards."}
{"text":"We went here last night for a last minute get together with friends for my sons birthday. We enjoyed the beer... The Pict. Creem. The bearded dragon. Pretty good. Food was only ok. We ordered pretzel bread. Wings. Sandwiches. Nothing remarkable. Unfortunately the service was slow. We were constantly looking around for the waitress who was frequently off chatting with other customers. The overall experience was just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again. But it was decent."}
{"text":"I came here after I found it on yelp. I ordered the N'rotic beer and man was it tasty. For my entree I ordered the poutine . Let me tell you it was the BOMB.COM. First time I had poutine was 3 yrs ago when I was in Montr√©al and it was just as good there as it was here. My only grumble was the grandpa band playing live music there. They were so AWEFUL,if it wasn't for my great beer and poutine I would have left as soon as possible. All in all I don't think I would return during happy hour. A little to noisy for my liking and I could not hear my husband talking to me. I will how ever return to refill my growler of beer as I loved the taste."}
{"text":"For a brewing company in North Phoenix, this place does not disappoint. The beer is nice. My favorite is the Crema. Delicious. But what's really nice is that they have tasty food and friendly service. The crab dip made from mascarpone cheese is everything. I haven't had anything on the menu that I did not like. I enjoy the open modern atmosphere. The only thing that I would note is that it tends to get loud, when there's a lot of people. You can always escape to the mini patio if that bothers you. Overall, great place in a location close to home."}
{"text":"Wow.  I mean, the beer is amazing, but I'm still swooning over the brussel sprouts.  Holy crap.  This place has a phenomenal kitchen.  The staff here is amazing as well.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  Seriously.  Do it.  Oh my god.  The brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"I am definitely a foodie and tried North Mountain brewing after seeing a segment on Check Please the local PBS food show. The beer was absolutely wonderful and the bartender, a female with short blond hair was knowledgeable and extremely courteous, always had a smile on her face. I tried the shepherds pie which was featured on the show and was told by the young lady bartending it was one of their signature dishes, it was absolutely delectable, I could've eaten another serving, it was so fabulous. I over ate a little bit and tried the fried banana split, what a way to finish your meal, it was incredible. I live in Scottsdale, but would hitchhike, walk or even crawl to this restaurant, the food is memorable and the atmosphere is that of a fun gathering spot. Five stars well deserved."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their grilled cheese with bacon and tomato soup. I go here a few times a month and always enjoy the friendly and fast service and atmosphere of the people. Don't forget to grab a very reasonably price flight of beer while you're there! Promise no regret."}
{"text":"Here I go again, reviewing a brewery when I don't drink beer.  But for the grub, a solid 3 stars.  Or a weak 4 if you're the glass is always half full type.   I enjoyed my first visit, mostly because of some great company.  We shared appetizers.  Up first...pretzel bread.  How can you go wrong with that?  By not making cheese sauce a standard accompaniment.  You can add for a buck, so we made it clear we wanted a lot of it.  A vat of it, the more the better.  We received a thimbleful of cheese, for three women who love cheese.  That would be like serving us a shot of wine.  We also had the mussels and poutine.  The mussels were yummy and bathed in a white wine butter sauce.  Wine and butter together.  Who could ask for more?  The poutine was good, but needed more short rib and more cheese curds.  Now we're back on the cheese thing.  We finished with the North Mountain malt and a piece of cake.  Loved them both.  Would order either again.  Maybe because they don't require cheese.  First impression didn't make me a huge fan, but I would go back if in the area again.  They have a great menu!"}
{"text":"Another brewery stop on my own personal \"baseball & brews\" tour. Definitely worth the drive (we got a little lost!). The beers were really good; naturally, I did a flight. Lights were better than dark, surprising choice for me. My favorite is C.R.E.E.M. ale."}
{"text":"Great spot for good beer, excellent service, friendly people, and fun music! The food looks delicious and amazingly fresh, I'm definitely going back to try a few entrees. Just dim the lights a smidgen and we're golden! :) It's great to see Sunnyslope resurrected!!"}
{"text":"A local brewer that produces some mighty fine beers. The food is typical brewery pub offerings that are just that.   The restaurant is spacious and they offer live entertainment. It is a favorite of the locals in the area and is a destination for others. They have a happy hour special that is $8 for a great burger, fries, and your choice of a 1/2 beer from anything they produce. There are pretty good offerings but that was my favorite. They hold concerts here from time to time. So, check their website to see what's doing. #vinosquared  #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"A nice craft brewery with a willingness to take chances, and in addition, they serve a good selection of food, at least as good if not better than most bars and restaurants. I've been coming here on and off for many months, sometimes just for one of their beers, but sometimes like today to grab a bite to eat. They make a surprisingly good flatbread pizza, simple but tasty.  Of the staff, only one I've interacted with much is Anthony, and he's extremely competent and very knowledgeable. Today I'm having the barbarian all-meat pizza, I've had it before, and Anthony suggested to spice it up with some locally grown Fresno peppers.  They have live music on some sort of regular basis, tonight it's a 3-piece playing old Eagles and other 70's stuff. Not exactly my thing, but it's a differentiator. It's convenient, located at next to the five or six points intersection of Dunlap, Cave Creek, 7th, and I think two or three other little streets.  Right now there's 12 of their own beers on tap, and each one of them is notable in one wY or another. I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. In the past few months, it seems they've had a kindling of interest in hops, and have made some very nice beers.  Finally, my wife likes the place and the food, she doesn't care for beer. But they have a decent selection of wine and that works for her. I recommend this place for good beer and tasty food."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the beer!  We are from San Diego which is the micro brewery capital and we've been to some of the best breweries and this ranks right up there with the top ones.  I'm calling it now, this brewery is hidden secret that is going to be big.   We got the flight and I loved every beer but my favorite was the Kaiserlich Dunkleweiss.  The food was great too.  We got the poutine which was really good and the pretzel which went perfect with the beer and the honey mustard was so good.  If you are a beer lover, I highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Good food... Good atmosphere.. Wish they would bring back the oysters! Wish they had a better wine selection. I go very often with a bunch of people and never have a problem.. Love their wedge salad!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I thought this place was going to be amazing. But it actually exceeded my expectations. Chef Justin's food is going to blow your mind. Met him tonight and he seems like family already. We had the Oxtail lumpia (the meat tender and with a perfectly crisp wrap,) Ahi Tuna dish that will rock your pallet, also had the risotto with chicken and finished the meal with  my first ever WORT milkshake. Talk about malty goodness. Presentation of all items were perfect! Hello.. 1 star reviews - it was the opening of a brewery/restaurant , of course it's going to be crowded. And for the record, this is a large place with ample parking. Far better than some of the other fine establishments mentioned. The kitchen staff was in concert with each other like a perfect sonnet when we arrived. They were happy, pleasant and responsive. No doubt due to the leadership of their Chef.  Beer was outstanding, weakest in MHO was the Pale, but still a solid beer. The ESB and Hefeweizen were spot on. This is very rare for first batches from any new brewery. I did not have the fries, but will check them out TOMORROW! My only criticism was lighting might be a little bright, but not distracting. And if that's the only suggestion this very detailed project manager has, this place should get 6 stars whether it was opening night or 6 months from now. And...personally if wrote an email, BASHING or congratulating a new establishment on opening week, I would not expect an email within 24 HOURS. Good Grief."}
{"text":"Good beer. Nice atmosphere. Good service. We are visiting from out of town and specifically sought out a brewery. We are beer lovers and this place delivered some good ones. I had the creem. Simple. Lighter ale. Great beer for drinking in the Arizona sun out on their patio.  My boyfriend had the Hoy ipa. It was a very aromatic beer with a strong hoppy flavor.  Overall we liked the place. The patio was small but functional. Their menu looked good but was a little pricey. Our one criticism was that it was hard to tell if they were open. The need an open sign street side and their Parking is out back which took some hunting to find."}
{"text":"I had waited patiently for months in anticipation of this awesome brewery to open it's doors! It was worth every long drawn out month :)!! Not only is the blended Euro/Sunnyslope menu of libations and the food brilliant and extreme tummy friendly-you can't find a more friendlier and good humored staff! Great job Rob & Candy!! We'll be regulars :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find, right under our noses!  Why hadn't we come in before?  NMB is located in a convenient but unusual area.  To the east is a pretty trashy neighborhood around Dunlap and 12th.  To the north is the gorgeous North Mountain area and Point Tapatio.  That's why one can easily miss this place and drive right by it.  It's across the street from a cell tower camouflaged as a palm tree and catty corner from a funeral parlor.  But, once you walk inside, you're inside a lively and HUGE real, actual brewpub.  There are tanks behind the very large bar and a very big beer-hall sized restaurant.  The real test is the beer though, right?  NMB wins in the beer category.  The C.R.E.E.M. is listed as #1 on the menu and rightly so.  It's a gorgeous, creamy ale.  Did I not already mention how CREAMY it tastes?  Unreal.  Unlike a lot of PHX brewery's there's actually a lot for vegetarians, gluten free and paleo type people to eat here.  Paleo and beer?  Well, sure, they aren't really compatible, but if you want to go carb free for the food, you can.  There's also a black bean burger for the veg people and huge veggie sides for the no-carb folks too.  Gluten free people might be able to do the fried rice unless the soy sauce is a problem.  I think I covered it all for the alt food people. ;-)  I guess I should mention that my Salted Caramel Ale (or whatever it's actually called - they say it's made with homemade caramel) was very, very good.  It was rich like a porter, but less chocolatey.  I loved it.  I like the fact that you can get 9 oz beers here.  I don't want a big pint.  I like to take tastes.  They also have 8 beer flights for $15.  NMB is a keeper."}
{"text":"Great brewery! The food is very good, in fact you will be surprised how good. We had fried mushrooms which were outstanding. Beer selection is very good and not heavily IPA dominant. Pricing was reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Still a fan! Had the burger which was meaty, well-seasoned and juicy, the crab dip which was rich and creamy (had to ask for a few more crackers, which were happily provided) and the mac & cheese, which had the nice tang I look for in a sharp cheesy dish -- and enough cheese that you had to twirl your fork to break the strands!"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker but went there last night with husband and friend. Hubby and friend liked the beer. Hubby had the James Brown brew. Food not so good. I had the fish and chips. I would not recommend. But service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Beers were all great. My only concern was the staff was not happy to be working there. We asked the bartender how the place was and he referenced wanting to burn the place down, but that wasn't possible because of the brick. If you want people to come back the staff has to want to be there. I will return at least 1 more time because the beer is good but you may want to talk to the clown behind the bar."}
{"text":"Okay experience. Great beer! The stout is some of the best I have had rivaling Oregon's finest but my first experience there was marred by a group of smokers actually smoking on their beautiful patio! I wouldn't mind if when the servers and management who walked by had reminded them it was a non smoking establishment but nothing was said. We finally had to say something to management but the night was ruined. As great as your beer may be you must provide a pleasant experience with great service.   We may give it one more chance. We will see."}
{"text":"A really good local brew pub.  On the food side they continue to improve.   NMB has a really wide selection of beers and in this day of IPA doesn't rely on just hoppy beers. NMB is always coming out with new brews   My advice is to start with a beer sampler."}
{"text":"Great little brewery in Phoenix. Tried most of the beers that they had. My favorite was CREEM. It tasted like honey. The poutine is to die for. Good reviews on their shepherd's pie and burger of the week! It had hollandaise sauce which was a fantastic idea. Their version of the skillet cookie with ice cream was really great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a group to sample the beers that were on tap.  All of the beers were good and the one that stood out most was the cosmik IPA.  We also enjoyed amazing pretzels with mustard and whip cream. Great place for a craft beer and some grub!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite microbreweries. The beer variety is excellent and the food is delicious. This is not the typical pub fare.   I recommend the Poutine along with the cookie for dessert. The service is friendly and it has a cozy neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Of Monsters And Men - Mountain Sound)  I heard them brewing in the valley So I called my friends and fam Far away from all the commotion  I had caused with my two hands  Thirsty we traveled armed with nothing but a hunger We came, from far away  Hold your craft brews now (Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down) Through the peaks we ran (Deep into the North Mountain Brew) Hold your craft brews now (Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down) Through the peaks we ran   North Mountain Brewing is off the map in my books.  I wouldn't have guessed it exist simply because I don't travel to that part of Phoenix often. However, I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit this locally own brewery!  North Mountain focuses on what they call Beercentric foods; or foods that are inspired by beers.    I came on a Sunday afternoon brunch with a gang of a 7 and went for the beer flights right away.  I'm not much of a beer drinker anymore, but I can say the beers I ordered were definitely tasty and each had it's own character; some sweet, some floral, and some strong like whiskey!  Overall, I really enjoyed their beers.  However, I'm a food guy so let's get started!    I wasn't too hungry the day I attended, but they seemed to have some mouthwatering dishes; Poutine breakfast, Chicken & Waffles, and Skillet Scrambles.  Today I ordered the North Mountain Scramble with over-easy egg.  Overall, the sausage and bacon beneath was cooked to perfection with the oozing of the egg; gave this dish welcoming brunch bite with every sip of beer!  What I also appreciate about the dish I ordered was the size; it wasn't overly huge to the point where I had to take some home.  All the other dishes seemed pretty big, but I guess I picked it right this time around! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker but I wanted to go here because they brew their own beers.  It was a laid back atmosphere and good service.  Our waiter recommended a beer for me and I was able to buy it and take it home.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is waaaay out of the way compared to all the other cool Central Phoenix hotspots, but well worth it. Having finally decided to visit what is comparatively middle-of-nowhere, I have no regrets! Upon entering, the lavish Christmas decorations caught me off guard, and it was so fancy I thought I might be a bit too casual.   I took a few steps forward, and realized this place is casual...and rad! With the benches in the dining area, the stacks of crates in an open kitchen, and the unpolished, paper menus, this place was reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. That is, If my high school served beer.   The brews were clearly unique. Brown IPA? Strong, bitter blonde ale? In the age of craft beer that tries to make a name for itself, North Mountain is attempting to corner each and every niche ignored by big names like San Tan and Four Peaks. Will it work? Only time will tell.   The menu is pretty eclectic, but I tried a miniature pizza because I'm not as adventurous with food as I am with alcohol. Did not disappoint. All of my beers kicked my ass, especially the Belgian Trippel, which save for a haunting, slightly sour note, tasted very authentic (Trust me, I've been to Belgium).   So in the end, North Mountain seeks to do everything that no one else will, and for very good prices. Service was excellent, and it was a pleasure meeting the owner as well as his niece who served us. I wish nothing but success for this up-and-coming business. If they can start looking as professional as other breweries, and offer more than a handful of beers at a time, they'll totally get my elusive fifth star!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here every few months since it opened and each time we have left satisfied. We usually try to sit at the bar because typically service is better there. The times that we've had to sit at the tables it seems like the servers forget about you after your meal is served. But with saying that, we will return again.  Their craft beers are very good, food portions are on the larger side, especially if you get a hamburger!! If you leave hungry it's your own fault. Grilled chicken is amazing, roasted cauliflower, ahi....yum! They have a very small patio with 4 tables that fronts Dunlap. A nice little restaurant in North Central Phoenix that you should try."}
{"text":"This place has a solid beer selection. The red ale is popular. The owner sometimes hangs out at the front and drinks, which is entertaining in some ways, but I can tell the staff is annoyed."}
{"text":"I hate to do this for so many reasons and idk if it's even the right thing to do. I have been here  couple times and see out 50% of the time it's a solid 5 star the other visits I kinda wanna strangle the staff.   The good.  Bartender, male...with beard and drinks a few beers lol. Amazing!!! Attentive, positive, energetic, funny and made the experience way better. Great beer recommendations, food, and as said funny.   The bad.  Female bartender, blonde..shoulder length hair. Awful. I sat for a while and didn't even get looked at...she moves slow and had no real drive.  I finally got a menu from another patron and then she came over. I mean...really. the I ask about the 8$ beer and burger combo for happy hour markers she stares at me..then asks me how I'd  like my burger cooked. I tell her then tell he I'd like a 6$ beer not a 5$ beer on the menu and she told me I couldn't have it cause the buttons on the computer aren't set up that way. Omg. I'm going nuts by this  point and so are the people next to me. I finally get it ordered. Phew!!!   Then she only talks to male patrons and flirts while I'd like another beer. Jeeze.   Good had always been a! Pretzels leave room to be desired but the burgers, poutine, and fish and chips rocks.  In conclusion that bartender sucks!!! Sorry dear.   Also, I don't wanna hear your  business talk about WiFi, if u think table 312 is one the first date cause she's smiling a lot, or how everyone wants to eat at the same time...yeah dinner  time. Ugh!!!   Bitch fest over  Good just avoid the crazy bartendress!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the American dream! I love everything this establishment stands for...husband..wife..children..niece combo!  The beers here are unique and named after books. I had many tasty beverages and the brewmaster was very knowledgeable.   Wish you the best!"}
{"text":"We always looking to try new things. We tried the beer and sliders. I like the  IPA beer and braised pork sliders were awesome. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't written a review for North Mountain yet? I love this place!  Impressions: On entry you come in off a lot which shares it's space with a few other businesses. One may not expect the beauty within from the exterior without.  Once you enter through the double doors, you see a window which shows you the fermenting towers they are using to brew the delicious beers they serve. You take a turn to the right, and see a high vaulted dining room with a bar directly to your left. Several long tables adorn the center, with a few smaller tables to either side. To the back are garage style doors which exit into a patio.   Food and Drink: The food is great here! I am slightly upset that they got rid of their Sausage platter, however I would suggest the wings any day of the week. Order the house hot though, not the franks hot, those you can get anywhere.  As far as beer, I recommend you find out which one you like for yourself. They serve flights, so you can try several at one setting without killing your ability to function safely later. My favorites are usually their nut browns.   Service: Service is good here. There have been a few occasions where I've had to wait a few minutes before they came to my table, however this place is almost always busy. I've never had a bad time, and often times if there's an issue, the employees fix it very quickly.  As it says in the starting sentence, I love this place. It's delicious, owned by dog lovers, and is just a shot down from my favorite bar in town. If you haven't tried this place, I would tell you, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Cool spot! The hubs and I popped in for a brew in between moving activities. They have so many choices and the hubs loved that he could do a huge flight of samples. i could be wrong but I am pretty sure that you could do an 8 taster sampler if you wanted. I would be trashed if I did that. Relaxed atmosphere. Wouldn't hesitate to bring the child monster next time. Menu looks truly delicious. Stared a man down while he was eating some skillet mac and cheese. Almost clubbed him and took his mac. Can't wait to try the food out and revisit this review."}
{"text":"North Mountain Brewing has not only some good local brews, but the food is outstanding! We have only visited twice and both times we recieved great service and liked our beer selection. We have tried several things off the menu.. all were very good."}
{"text":"Best beer and brewery food we've had in Phoenix, our waiter Peter was attentive, polite and efficient. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our meal came out more than 30 minutes after we ordered. When waitress arrived, she accidentally dropped a full plate of Cesar salad on my chest and stomach. I'm 5 months pregnant, and the impact I the stonewear plate hurt me. The waitress brought out another salad, but I sent it back having lost my appetite. My father who paid our bill was too much of a gentleman to say a word about the full bill he got including charges for the salad. Later that night we were talking about the salad spill. I asked him if they took the salad off the bill. He told me they didn't but we just won't ever come back bc \"the food wasn't good anyway\". I was so disappointed. I called and complained about such poor customer service. I was told \"they would try to comp our bill before it closes out in the computer\"  but that's not even the point or why I called. Take a lesson on customer service, please! Your other reviews widely mention poor customer service. Clearly a problem. Never returning"}
{"text":"First time visit and the cardinal red ale mixed with pretzel is amazing. More of the whipped honey butter please ! Lol"}
{"text":"Wow!  Crazy good and strong beers!  Delightful foods as well.  Staff was friendly, fairly attentive, and helpful in making our choices on the beer.  I usually drink IPA's, but they have some strong beers at this place!    Kind of hard to identify the place off the street, all the parking is in the back.  The staff responded a little slow but otherwise a fine establishment to grab an excellent craft beer and relax for awhile.  Definitely looking forward to visiting again on the next trip to the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a group after hiking Shaw Butte.  With all the different beers and foods we tried and shared most all were hits.  The portions were ample.  Service was mostly good.  Our group was large enough to put a strain on the kitchen so it took a while for our food.  The room had a good feel to it.  There is a nice patio but we all decided it was too hot to sit out there in the sun.  There are umbrellas but there is always somebody left out in the sun."}
{"text":"Met up with some fellow friends for a Hike and Brew, I sadly did not make the hike but was able to join in for the brew, the place picked was North Mountain Brewing Co.   We were a pretty big group, maybe 15 to 20, and we had 2 servers one on each side of the table and they were pretty good at making sure we had what we needed. The kitchen area is opened and I could see that there were 2 guys working it. The vibe of the place is great, opened ceiling, wooden tables, and opened kitchen, rustic and industrial. I enjoyed it.  I 1st ordered a 7 flight of beer, thought it would be the best way to figure out what I like and don't like, I can say I enjoyed PT 42, the oatmeal stout, hefe & esb and my favorite was creem .  After checking out the menu I went with the North Mtn Burger, but I had already seen a burger come out and saw that the fries are shoe string fries (those are not real fries)  so I asked if I could replace the fires with something else and that's what I did.  The burger was a Kobe beef style, had butter lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, white cheddar cheese, mustard and spicy aioli sauce. Over all the burger was good, I was a craving a beefy cheeseburger, but sadly this was not it, the cheese had been charbroiled onto the burger could only tell cheese was there by the crispy burnt corners of it. The spicy aioli sauce was great and went well with everything.    Instead of the fries I got a side of their brussel sprouts, they were roasted brussel sprouts with fresno peppers, red onions and cotijia cheese. I really enjoyed these, the peppers were fresh and had a spicy little touch to them, it went perfect with the roasted flavor of the brussel sprouts enjoyed this dish much more than I would have with the shoe string fries.   It was a good time with friends and exploring the many flavors of beer!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I visited here on September 22nd for an alumni happy hour that Ottawa University was having.  We were impressed by the politeness and helpfulness of the staff. The chicken wings were seasoned and flavored to perfection with a crispness on the outer skin--blue cheese and ranch dressing on the side for dipping, baked macaroni & cheese with a smoky Gouda on the top and several different types of flatbread pizzas that were very tasty. We were given a tour of the brewery where the magic happens by the owner/master brewer and another master brewer. He explained how they make the crafted brews, going into detail about it all comes together. The restaurant is clean and popular with the locals. It is a friendly, comfortable environment. It was a very nice evening and we will be back."}
{"text":"I went there last night. My friend had the loaded macaroni and a ridiculously small sized beer. I ordered the southwest burger with avocado. 15 minutes after my friend's food was served and she was done eating they brought out my southwest burger! It was a tiny burger with cheese on a dry bun with brown chopped lettuce and a side of chipotle sauce, without avocado.  So I sent it back.  Then the cook? or who ever he was, came to my table and confronted me, wanting to know why I sent it back, so I had to explain to him why the burger sucked.  This place has terrible food, poor service and a pushy cook.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The food, beers (duh), and staff are all great and my husband and I had a wonderful experience at this family owned, relaxed little gem in north central Phoenix. The Lumpia (Filipino dish) is yummy; order it, you won't regret it! I had the Stout (it's fantastic) and one of the burgers. Very good quality! Will return!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in myself for not reviewing this sooner. So forgive me and I will try to do my best to tell you everything I have tried if not the whole menu. ^_^  From most favorite to least I will make a list of everything starting with Favorite first and with a short description on why I like it. -Poutine: So full of cheesy goodness and meat and fries?!  such an amazing combo and the cheese is melted so perfectly it makes me drool thinking about it. -Mussels:I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend ordered this because the mussels I am used to looking at are much bigger in size.  These were little guys that reminded me of clams but in a butter sauce and with a side of sliced toasted bread which is delicious. Ahi-I love raw fish more than a lot of things, if I could eat sashimi every day I think id be in heaven. But this was much different, more of like a poki ahi salad stacked nicely with a great tasting sauce. Crab Dip-amazing as well, I love cheese and dips together. So delicious. Just try it! -Deep fried banana split- no need for a description its just good! -piece of cake- also good no comment needed! -Spent Grain cookie- different not my favorite but good also -Grilled sausage platter- too much potatoes for my personal taste but the sausages with the potatoes were good together. -North mountain malt-was like a shake, pretty good! -Pizza- this one was kind of our fault,  my boyfriend and I like to watch diners drive ins and dives and shows similar.  We watched andrew zimmern in MN add a over easy egg to a pizza when it was almost done cooking so it could ooze over the pizza.  Sounds delicious.  No one out here understands how to do that here at all when we try to explain it.  So what we got was like a breakfast scrambled egg pizza with lettuce on it since we ordered the Cesar. Gross."}
{"text":"After a day at the pool, this was great! Folks at the table tried burgers, poutine, and pizza, but the winner was the carne asada fries!  AND! If adults order an entree, a kids meal was free! We didn't even realize it until the bill came!"}
{"text":"Great pub/ brew house. Really enjoyed the selection of beers. Quality brews! Food was very good. Had the poutine with braised spare ribs. Highly recommend it. Wife had pork sliders and she reports very good as well. Outside seating available but wait list too long on Saturday night. Parking in rear of brewery by the way."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ordered a flight of beer (8 different beers, 4 ounce pours.)  We really enjoyed most of the beers.  I could easily drink more of the dark and light Belgians.  My hubby loved the Octomalt.  We didn't eat any food, but we will make sure we try it on our next visit.  We will absolutely be back for another taste of those brews!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the food solid, and the beer fantastic!  I'm a vegetarian, so I rarely go into restaurants with much hope - however they have THE BEST brussel sprouts and cauliflower!  They prepare them in a skillet and are SO GOOD.  The pretzel & cheese is solid also.  I dislike hoppy beer and fortunately they have a great selection.  I had a heffe here which is my favorite.....a great clove taste at the end that makes it especially tasty.  But...what really makes everything come together here is the service.  People are so friendly and they really seem to be proud of the beer!  They love to talk about how it's different than other beers - and have such loyalty to the master brewer.....you can't help but want to support this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the beer centric food, and of course the beer! Get the flight and try them all. I've had the poutine, the hot wings, the burgers, the ahi tuna appetizer, the pretzel bread, and the malt! The food has never disappointed me. The burgers are hands down the best I've had in Phoenix. I'm originally from Nebraska where we take our beef very seriously, and their burgers have wowed me. They use the beer wort to make an ice cream malt that is amazing. No alcohol in it, but has a hint of beer flavor that makes it a refreshing treat. Service has always been spot on for me."}
{"text":"Only giving a 4 because the service was friendly and the soup was excellent. The beers arent very good. Standard, run-of-the-mill beers from a small brewpub. Hef, esb, porter, ipa, yawn, etc. Nothing stood out. Nothing was off or skunky in any way...I just look for a place that pushes the envelope and these beers just dont do that. Also they were out of 4 beers and no longer serve oysters...which was the reason I came here aside from tryin local brews"}
{"text":"We had a completely enjoyable time. I am not a big beer drinker, but their citrus one I tried was fantastic. The food was good. I had a great burger and we did the fried mushrooms, very good. We will be heading back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger and had heard good things about this place. I placed a to-go order. Staff was super friendly & my order was made fresh because I could see my food being cooked when I walked in and sat at the bar. The burger was good, it had great flavor. It was the North Mountain burger which comes with white cheddar, mustard, spicy aoli, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickles. Fries had a nice, perfect crispy. My only complaint was it was kind of pricy at $14 & change for the meal with no drink before tip. Too bad they don't do lunch pricing!"}
{"text":"We went in to try the beer on a Sunday ( Mother's Day).  Got a 6 beer sampler and a single. 7 oz. glass. There was a good variety of beer styles to choose from. I appreciated the fact that they didn't have a bunch of cutesy flavored beers like a lot of other local breweries.   All the beer was good to very good. Our favorite was the Bonita Saison (available seasonally) with a close second being the Far West IPA.   We also shared an order of fries. They were thin and very crispy with a dusting of herbs. Based on this limited food experience, I would definitely like to try the rest of the menu. Our server was prompt, friendly and casual.  This seems like a great place to hang out with friends while working your way through the beer list."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!  New fav place for great beer and good food.  We decided to try this place a couple weeks ago based on word of mouth praise, NMBC not only met my expectations, but exceeded them.  Tried a flight of 6 beers and never felt rushed to get through them and the food.  Love their Baby Belgium which is hands down my favorite.  I am telling everyone I know about NMBC."}
{"text":"Surprisingly distinctive array of beers.  we sampled twelve  wonderful and unique flavor profiles ranging from a light C.R.E.E.M golden ale brewed with arizona wildflower honey (which gives it a distinctively sweet flavor) to a N.I.B imperial stout aged in a 32 year old rum Bartell with real Vermont syrup.  The gastro grub is delicious and savory, complementing the beers beautifully.  We had a sizable bowl of poutine with short rib over cheese fries and gravy. A foot long Chicago dog, and grilled cheese with tomato bisque. The menu sported a good variety of international bites as well as pizzas and burgers...pretty much what you would expect from a gastropub.  Service was attentive and fast, although server did not make a point of telling us what the beers in the flight were, or make recommendations or walk us through the menu. Personally, when it comes to breweries, I like the purveyors of the beer to be excited about it, talk about, and educate me.  I give the beer 4 stars for sure!!! I think NMB has a very memorable and distinct beerganization!"}
{"text":"My visit to North Mountain Brewing Co. was good - A-OK is the perfect description.  Our group of 3 enjoyed sharing a variety of items in between the marathon of talking and laughing:  Pretzel Bread - In my world, all pretzel bread needs to be served with cheese.  As much cheese as possible.  I get it, not everyone loves cheese as much as I do, but to charge an additional $1 for the smallest ramekin of cheese ever is kind of disappointing.    Poutine - My first time ever having poutine, so I don't have a basis of comparison.  It did seem to have way more gravy than short rib meat and cheese.  More cheese, please!!  Mussels - Favorite thing we tried - a nice portion, with sourdough bread to dip in the savory white wine butter sauce.  Piece of Cake - Cute little dessert, topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  North Mountain Malt - I could have happily taken this all for myself, but was practicing my 'polite' skills.  I would definitely go back, but would smuggle in my own cheese (ssssshhh!!). :)"}
{"text":"Tried many of the beers and didn't like any of them.  My pizza tasted like an undercooked LeanCuisine.  My husband's fish n chips was over cooked. Went for their signature Beer only to be told they didn't have any. Great atmosphere and service though!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time and I'm utterly disappointed.  First the waitress was great but we couldn't really figure out what the sizes of the beers were.  Next the pizza I ordered was horrible it tasted like a deep-fried piece of cardboard with prepackaged tiny tiny frozen vegetables and if you're going to name your pizza garden pizza it should have big garden fresh vegetables on it this did not.  I tried to order the Thai pizza without pork but the waitress said they could not do it without the pork because it's premade that way.  My partner really enjoyed the house hamburger really really enjoyed that; he would love to come back.  I feel like the new menu needed  more selection and why are tacos only available on Tuesday,  how about tacos every day? Finally the music on the radio was really bad no style, no feeling,  no favorites, it was just yelling uncomfortable yelling station set by some douchebag and yuck.  Bad music where you can't just relax."}
{"text":"Started off with the rude waitress. I was looking through the menu and she said \"hello\" and banged on the table and waved at me. The friends we were with actually brought it up. I hadn't said anything but was glad I wasn't just being sensitive.  When the food came out, we were disappointed. We weren't expecting greatness but still disappointing. The Poutine used packaged gravy and had no actual cheese curds. The steak sandwich was dry and flavorless. The wings were so dry. The meatball sliders were burnt. The string fries were stale. Like I said, we were just looking for a place to hang out, drink and grab some food. But I would not recommend this one to anyone."}
{"text":"Shockingly good find. I had a beer flight (12 samples) and split some Poutine with my wife. The Poutine was super cheesy with perfectly tender short ribs. Our server who is also a chef was excellent, she recommended chocolate dessert she created and it was to die for. I will definitely be returning here. 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here a number of times and I admit there's always room to improve on elements of service and food.  But  two things non withstanding is the service, beer, and the attempt to be good at food.   This will be my 6th visit, and I'm pleased that the servers are friendly, helpful, nice and above all enthusiastic to be at North Mountain.  I'm always thrilled that I was chosen to be a guinea pig for a potentially new item to go on the menu.   You can't go wrong on the food, the excellent service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience,, We went to dinner on March 4 with my Family and Special needs son and it started off fine the drinks came out the appetizer came out , BUT when it came time for the meals that's when it started ,, Everyone was served their food Except my 12 year old son. The waitress went and served my son's burger to another table, then instead of letting us know she just ignored our table, not  till I got up out of my seat and said \"where is my son's food everyone is over half way done with their meals and he's had nothing\"  they just said We're sorry it was a mistake,, A mistake is fine BUT WHERE THE COMMUNICATION,, I just ended up saying just bag my food up so I can leave ,, Then to top it off ALL THEY DID WAS COMP THE  WRONG MEAL AND CHARGED ME FOR KIDS MEALS ON A NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE \"\"FREE\"\" , and when I called to speak to the Manager the girl kept telling he's busy or he's in a meeting. Over horrible experience ."}
{"text":"We live nearby, so we've eaten here a few times. The food is always tasty and the beer is cold. My only complaint is that the selections are pricier than they need to be."}
{"text":"Great Gastropub and Brewery in Sunnyslope.  Their beer selection is always changing, and I have yet to be disappointed.  They have something for everybody.  There is generally live music on the weekends.  Bartenders are always friendly and helpful.  This has become our favorite neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"My husband-to-Be and I decide to go try out this Brewery since he's been wanting to go for some time now. It wasn't bad at all! However, this is definitely a Hop lovers paradise! If you love your hops, go here! They have a \"CYRious Double IPA\" which is the king of kings IPA! Seriously. I took a whiff of it and I thought I was smelling a pine tree!   Unfortunately, we both don't like IPAs. But that doesn't mean we will give them a bad review for not having our type of beer. Great place! Good food! And the atmosphere was open.   My advice. If you love IPAs...bring a your friends too. It's made for huge groups of friends to hang out!"}
{"text":"Well I was super excited to see a cute beer joint in this neighborhood and couldn't believe it had already been here for over a year! Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love everything, it wasn't awesome. They had 10 beers listed, but were sold out of 2 (as luck would have it, the 2 my husband wanted to try). We got the 8-beer sampler to try the rest. The dark Belgian was good, but everything else had a super strong coffee/smoke flavor. None of our party of 4 was crazy about them.  The space is cute enough, and huge, and the patio looked nice. Service was friendly and helpful, if not especially quick.  The unexpected bright spot was the salad menu...I had a good kale salad and my mom had the spicy Brussels sprout one.  Glad I tried it, and I may be back in the name of supporting local business."}
{"text":"Amazing beer, outstanding knowledge of the beer, AND knock your socks off food! We had the burger and BBQ chicken pizza, both were freshly prepared, extremely flavorful, and worth the visit! Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place that I like to visit when I'm in this area of town. I dropped in on 2/13/2016 and was pleasantly surprised to find live music. It was great to see mature performers singing a wide variety of music. This is a difficult place to feel comfortable as a solo introvert, however. Most of the tables are huge and the bar is often crowded. The prices are also higher than average for good, but average food. For example, I ordered 2sides at $7 each; Brussels sprouts and Cauliflower. They were tasty, but the portions were approximately a $2-$3 value. I ate both, left, and purchased pizza elsewhere. I was also disappointed that they were not brewing Porter this week, so I ordered their Stout and took home a growler."}
{"text":"This brewery is very fitting if you like the mountain feel. Reminded me of home.  They have a good amount of beers and some unique tastes.  Food was a little pricey, but the burger tasted really good. Shoe string fries, which are pretty rare."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breweries in Arizona. The beer is awesome. A wide variety that rotates often. The food is amazing I would go there just to eat even if I didn't drink beer, but I do and theirs is great!in all seriousness the atmosphere and the staff make this place. Super relaxed and unpretentious. Big thank you to Omar we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went Thursday night for a fund-raiser with a group from work. Fun place. I liked the beer. I had the 8 glass sampler; a placemat would have been nice since I had no clue what each one was; but it was fun to try them all! We had a BBQ Chicken pizza. Not bad. The service was a tad slow, but I think they are still working out the kink; however, everyone was very friendly. I especially liked the tour of the brewery, the live music and the cool seating style. I think the Patio will be nice to enjoy once the temps are cooler. I'll be back...Looks like a great place for Sunday Funday."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and plan to return as often as I can. Though it is a trek from my home, on both visits both the food and the beer were excellent. I especially appreciate the frequency of updates to their beer menu and that they keep an updated list posted on their website."}
{"text":"North Mountain Brewing Company is an excellent place to eat. My friend and I went to lunch there, the other day. They have an outstanding menu. The Thai pizza is quite delicious and they have good drinks. They have a fantastic atompshere and the sever provided exceptional customer service. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great range of beers & ales, with good selection of Belgian-style ales. Good lunch menu too. We will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this brewery a few times now since I have moved to the neighborhood. We've tried a number of items from the menu and everything has been (mostly) delicious.  The pretzel bread, with the honey butter, mustard and cheese is a super tasty appetizer. I just wish it came with four pretzels instead of three.  The poutine - so delicious! The short ribs just fall apart, the cheesy, gravy amazingness is just...so, so good. If you're a first timer, I highly recommend the poutine.  The meat pizza, meh. It was okay, nothing to write home about, although we got the pizza in the same visit as the poutine, so it didn't really stand a chance.  We also ordered a beer sampler in our first visit to get an idea of what we liked and we didn't. The glasses for the sampler are HUGE, we shared them amongst a few people and we were all able to get a few sips. I personally enjoy the C.R.E.E.M. beer, nice and light.  The nice thing about this place is the live entertainment. Every time we've been there was a group playing, and the music was enjoyable but not overpowering.   They have indoor and outdoor seating, inside they also have some large communal style tables to sit at, which can be sort of fun.  I think this will definitely be our go to happy hour joint in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has upped their game. Like Fate Brewing, I was less than impressed with their initial offerings but over the course of a couple years in operation the bugs have been worked out and the quality has steadily improved. I would list Fate amongst the top brewpubs in the metroplex now and my hope is that NMB is on the same track. Case in point: I was going to get a flight in order to reassess my opinion of their lineup but the Helles Lager that I started with was so good I ended up drinking it all night. And if they can make a solid lager then that speaks volumes. Not 100% sold on the overall lineup but the technique is there and they are taking chances. A Broyhan on tap? Really? (Similar to a Berliner Weiss) Good variety on the tap list, high quality food with some interesting menu items, nice atmosphere. This isn't a premier beer geek destination just yet but it is showing promise  and I would definitely recommend it if you are in the area and want a well made beer. Concerns: parking is tight during peak hours and the ventilation system doesn't seem to be up to the task so when it's busy the place gets a little smoky from the open kitchen."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge beer guy, Cider is more my thing, after the Scotch,and rum, are gone but this place was worth taking a growler home from, then returning to get a refill.  The wings were really average , not bad, but the house hot, aren't  and were pretty small. Compared to the other appetizers hitting the table these were the red colored step-chickens of the family. E.G, the rest was great.   The poutine was excellent,  braised ribs, rich gravy and thick enough frys to support it, sure it could be a little more generous but,.. who am I kidding , I could eat that till I was carried out of the place. Maybe it's not authentic so I would happily be corrected if anyone could point me to a better source locally, that has beer. I think they are safe;)   On a non-food note. Not the most obvious entry into parking lot and their website hasn't caught up most people using mobile devices to access info when out.commits the menu on PDF sin"}
{"text":"A little pricey.  I got this one dish wish is canadian. I forget its name, but it was fries with sauce and cheese melted all up on it. (in short) with some other fixings too.  It was good, a little pricey (like i said earlier). The beers though...i know that is what we all care about. They are pretty good. It is nice to have a brewery in this location, and they are doing well.   I definitely would recommend getting their flight to try out the beers. figure out which you like the best. Their darker beers are good. from the browns to the porters.   Wasnt a big fan of their pilsner and other light beers."}
{"text":"The night I was there they had a Thunderbird Management Alumni group there--along with some fantastic musicians!  Lots of fun listening to great music for FREE! We had the pistoune (spelling?) which is made of some really great cooked short ribs, and fries.  Very delicious, and the meat was good quality which the bartender said they smoke for 16 hours.  The tenderness of the meat shows it was cooked a long time as it just melts in your mouth. Love the homemade beer here, but I don't like super strong beers so my friend got the Pilsner and I got the Creme--and both of us loved what we got.  If I reordered I'd get the Pilsner next time as it was just a smidge better tasting, but both were wonderful. Love this clean, little place!  Nice bartender who was really helpful, and even brought our food to the table near the stage.   Would love to come back here, for sure.  This place is a winner! ...And I'm giving this place 5 stars just because I loved the cleanliness and cuteness of this brightly lit place with the best homemade brewery beer I've had so far in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on a Saturday. Not too busy. Service was good. They had a very basic veggie pizza as the only veg option. Not great, but the beer flights are good. Nice little patio. Seems like a good neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I came from Sacramento on a business trip so was unfamiliar with the local brewery scene. I saw this place had good reviews so thought it was worth a try. We had the flight with some appetizers. The pretzel bread was good, but the honey butter that came with it was amazing! The lumpia was very good as well. For the beers, I liked the IPA and the baby Belgian. The Hefeweizen, C.r.e.e.m., and stout were good as well and worth trying. Overall, this place is still young, and as such, has some things that could use work, but there is definitely some great things they are doing and are have a bright future ahead of them."}
{"text":"I went here when it first opened and the beer and menu was lacking, so I haven't been back. Well, I went back with a friend because he hasn't been there yet and I do have to say that the menu has been revamped quite a bit and actually had quite a few things that I wanted. Also, they have a couple of IPAs on the menu, which was a huge improvement from last time.  I will be going back soon to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Had the pastrami sandwich and honey had the grilled cheese. Their beers are very good. Pastrami was 4 stars, a little dry for me. Honey said the grilled cheese needed more bacon, I liked it. The french fries are shoestring cut, really crispy, 5 stars there."}
{"text":"Good beer, good service, music is too frickin loud. Would have stayed longer but damn..... We can't talk"}
{"text":"This brewery rocks!!!  Love the atmosphere of this place as if is very casual and you just want to hang out. It is great for bigger parties or to chill at the bar by your self.   The beer selection is pretty big and always seems to be rotating.   But the food is where they really shine! The selection is amazing, and normally when a place has a bigger selection the food isn't as good but everything I have had so far is so delicious. The sliders are perfect start to split with a small group! Then the shareable sides are so good!   GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS! Also steak sandwich is on point!   Get her now!!!"}
{"text":"Great enivronment. Hidden location - which is what made it appealing, like a neighborhood secret. Everyone was friendly. Good energy.  My only turnoff - is im not a fan of the new cafeteria seating trend"}
{"text":"Had our first visit last night to see Jane in the Jungle perform.   Great live music, cool vibe, delicious food, and outstanding beers."}
{"text":"Now that's a good beer! (All of them)   North Mountain, you have potential for the 5 star but I haven't had your food. That's my bad but you got a great place!   Been here a handful of times now and it's definitely out of the way but it's worth the drive. I would recommend (and do) to anyone.   Good vibe. Good beer. Nice people.   Go for it!   #brewtour2016"}
{"text":"We ate at North Mountain Brewery for the first time tonight. Randy says his hamburger was delicious and so was my fish and chips.  There were other items on the menu that also looked good I.e. Pizza. The prices seemed a little high, but probably comparable to other restaurants in the area. Randy liked their Creme Ale and I also thought it tasted delicious. We'll probably go back, but maybe during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We had a large party and they accommodated us on short notice.  The service was awesome.  The food and beer were very good, we were a big party and everyone enjoyed what they ordered."}
{"text":"Great food.  We went there for fish on lent. My husband loved the fish and chips. Beer was great. I had the kale salad which was wonderful. Good service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first visit. Our group was given a private room. Lunch of fish and chips was tasty with heavy breading. Coleslaw a little heavy on the ginger. Big dining room looked like a fun place to enjoy the R&R music on Wed evenings! Will go back for the music and try another meal. Beer was fine!"}
{"text":"Just had the burger of the week, which is a Reuben burger this week. Oh was it good! And next week they'll change it up again. Ordered the Czech your mind, which is an imperial pilsner, and shared it with my husband. Then ordered the Tiempo de la Saison, a Saison aged in tequila barrels, which I kept for myself. I love the environment here, the people, the food. Not to sound corny, but it's like Cheers when you're \"family,\" everyone knows your name.. I'll always come back. I'm slightly biased because I know everyone there, and my husband has been head chef for a year. But I've also brought friends who've never been and now they're also hooked. *Order the lumpia for sure, and cheese dip"}
{"text":"Great place...tasty DIPA and awesome food!  Obvious Filipino touch including inay mamma and tasty lumpia and killer brussel sprout warm salad.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat, drink and relax here. Staff are always nice. The brews are spectacular. Mayor Greg Stanton has even enjoyed this establishment. Try the Grooving With The Pict brew. Had the fish n chips. Crispy battered. Not usually a fan of tarter sauce but theirs has a great non overpowering taste with a hint of wasabi. Had the pretzel bread with added cheese. My son loves the sweet dip. For dessert. The freshly baked cookie with icecream is a must."}
{"text":"I sadly give North Mountain a less than enthusiastic review because I had such high expectations.  Unfortunately, while the beer was fairly good, the service needed some serious attention.    We went the day after the grand opening and waited ten minutes for them to figure out where they were going to seat us when they had more than half of their tables available.  Then, it took another fifteen minutes for us to get a server who would take our drink and appetizer order.  By the time we finally got our beers and pretzels, we were so discouraged that we opted to go have dinner elsewhere.    Also, this place isn't nearly as kid friendly as most of the other breweries in town--it's mostly an eclectic adult menu--or if they have a kids menu, nobody told us about it. I would definitely give them another shot, but they need to figure out how to serve their patrons in a more organized fashion."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good there. Have to park on back of building cause off of a main road so go to next street to get into it, it's easier. Our first server was pretty good but only had him to order our good. Girl we got next was nice but I had to go find someone to get our check cause after she cleared table never came back n them had to find someone else to give check to in order to get it paid. By the way, they weren't busy."}
{"text":"It needs to be said that North Mountain Brewing has the BEST poutine in the Valley, period!   Thick, delicious french fries with a healthy dousing of brown gravy. Some of the most tender short rib I've ever had.   And let's not forget those ooey, gooey cheese curds.  Thankfully with all of this, it wasn't overly salty.  We dropped in here for one of Dude's Brews Cruise UYEs and the crew at North Mountain was nothing short of accommodating with our group of 15.   Our server Chris was on top of making beer recommendations and getting tasters for our various beer drinkers in the group.   We were pretty sure that North Mountain wouldn't be willing to make a reservation for 18 on a Friday, but Candy the manager was a sweetheart (we got to meet her!) and made it happen, no questions asked.    I'm not the Captain of these beer-swilling events and had to drive, so sadly didn't imbibe. I did get a sip of the Barrel Aged CardinAle red which tasted like a hoppier red I could tolerate.   North Mountain Brewing is another excellent option in our growing Phoenix brewery scene - Looking forward to coming back and trying a full flight."}
{"text":"Well it took me over a year to finally try out North Mountain. I don't know what took me so long but I'm glad I finally got a time to visit. We came on a Saturday night and I was impressed with the set up. We sat at the bar which has a view of the kitchen and there was a small band playing.  While sitting at the bar we were met with a friendly bartender that knew all of the beers and seemed to really enjoy his work. Wish I would have caught his name.   Ordered the IPA which was really good. Tried my friend's brown and it was really good as well. We also tried the loaded Mac and cheese and it was awesome!  I've heard that the food here is really good.   Overall I will come back to NMBCo. Seems like a good place to eat dinner with a great beer or just a place to enjoy a beer or two with friends.   On a side note parking is in the pack and don't drive too fast or you will miss the entrance!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!!  Ordered off the brunch menu, breakfast corn dogs sounded good. Pancake batter dipped sausage, scrambled eggs and hash browns. Where to start...eggs had a grey hue to them, sausage thing was burnt and dripping in grease, hash browns were ice cold and tasteless. Husband had a burger which was overdone and the bread was hard. We just wanted food and not beer. Other yelp reviews said the food was really good and restaurant was close to home so we thought we would give local a try. Sad to say we still have to travel a bit out of our area to get a decent bite to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent beer period! Not mass produced. We had amazing beer and the best crap dip. Next time we will have dinner. Great friendly crowd. The bar tender was excellent, very attentive and even arranged a personal tour on the spot of the back room brewery! We will be back."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this place. I ordered my hamburger medium-rare and it came out medium-well. If it was cooked properly it probably would have been good. The fries were good. Service was spotty at best."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual spot for dinner and decided to give North Mountain a try.  Food was good (shoestring fries!), good beer, decent prices ($4 glass of house wine), attentive service. All around a good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and awesome spot to hang out. Service wasn't the greatest. Our server definitely didn't want to be there and we all said we wouldn't get the same meal again but the beer selection made up for it. Get a flight. Too many good ones to just pick one."}
{"text":"This brewery is excellent! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is one of the waiters is terrible. Worst service I've ever seen...however every other waiter does an excellent job. Beer and food is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries to enjoy an amazing meal. Consistently good service and so many tasty food and beer options. Great atmosphere with a private room if you are looking to have a group event. We made North Mountain part of our brewery tour beer tour bachelor/bachelorette party and they took such good care of us. If you haven't already checked this place out I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have to tell you I don't often travel to Sunny Slope but this place is very cool and unexpected.   The food was great and the beer very good as well.   Fun time"}
{"text":"Well, the hubby and I were up in North Phoenix a couple weekends ago and I just had to stop in and check out North Mountain Brewing Co. I had bookmarked them after stopping by their booth at the Strong Beer Festival in February but they are pretty far from where we live so I hadn't gotten around to paying them a visit even though I have seen some pretty good reviews from fellow Yelpers. Unfortunately we had just had a huge meal so we did not sample any of the food but I did try all four beers that they had on tap that day. Their production facility is pretty small so they don't make a whole lot but the nice thing is they do also keep some other local brews on tap so you are sure to find something you would like to drink.  I tried the four that they make themselves. First off was their Funk 49 wheat ale, similar to a Hefeweizen but with a bit more flavor. It was a nice light beer, perfect for summer, and had a pleasant mild taste with a crisp citrus aftertaste. Hubby ordered one of those put an orange in it, as he is wont to do. Next we tried the CREEM Ale. This one was a bit lighter than I was expecting but surprisingly enough I really liked it and ended up ordering a pint. I can't remember how they categorized it but to me it was like a very mild red ale but with some really strong caramel undertones. We also tried their pale ale which as expected was a bit too hoppy for me and their Nonpartisan lager which also as expected was too tasteless (nothing against NMB, I just don't care for pale ales or lagers). I look forward to trying their stout some day since that one sounds great!  We had a great time chatting with the friendly bartender. Everyone working there seemed really nice and they greeted most folks by name as they entered (it was the middle of the day so they were not busy). Even though the interior looks brand spanking new and everything was pretty shiny and modern, it still had a homey feel to it since the space was small and very open. Also, the smells coming from the kitchen were mouth watering and their menu looks fantastic. I love the fact that they have some traditional pub food but then throw in some unexpected twists. They even had some Vietnamese items on there. Apparently they just lost their chef so they may be reworking the menu soon, though. And it sounds like their beers change all the time. Next time we are in this neck of the woods we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Stout, Great pizza, Great people, great place! A must for everyone! Parking is in the rear, so don't be fooled by the lack of road-front space; just look for the open patio!"}
{"text":"TBH I didn't try any of the food here and went straight for the beer flight. All good here with the exception of their Ipacious  I.P.A. $6  (ABV=7.7% / IBU's=68) which was outstanding. Can't even remember what the others in the flight tasted like because their IPA is just that good."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was much larger than I was expecting. A good number of beers on tap, all of them brewed there. Plenty of seats at the bar and a large, open room with several tables. I would recommend a flight of 6 or 8 because they have so a large selection. I started with a stout and it was excellent. It was the winner of the first annual Brewer's Ball put on by Badwater Brewing this year. Second, I have a dirty blonde - which was also excellent. While there I was able to sample a few other beers and I would have been happy with any of them. Additionally, I ordered the fish and chips - three nice short and fat pieces of fish, thin french fries and very good. Plus the staff was incredibly friendly and I enjoyed talking with them. Definitely check out this place if you are on that side of town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were close by and decided to stop in. So glad we did. Beers were on point! Excellent beers and Bernie was very informative and recommended beers. He was a great beer tender."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place, we've gone here a few times since we don't like to trek far from the house and were always disappointed. The hostess (owners wife) is rude, customer service is not on their menu only to serve you get your money and onto the next patron. It's always really busy, loud and the food is nothing really to brag about. After reading all the reviews looks like they have serious issues with customer service, even if the waiters and waitress' are good it's the first impression of the hostess that sets the precedent to decide whether or not patrons will return."}
{"text":"I'm currently visiting Phoenix for the Copa America Mexico Vs Uruguay game , was looking up local bars & lounges to grab a quick bite and drink . Saw the reviews and decided to give this place a shot . I ordered their 8 craft bundle deal and the Amazing ITALIAN SUB with the greatest side of fries I ever tasted . The waiters here are nice and friendly and work at a fast pace , constantly checking up to make sure everything is A Ok . Love this place Here and will be returning if I'm ever in Phoenix again :) this place deserves more than 5 stars ! Thank you Baby Jesus for the North Mountain Brewery ."}
{"text":"Music night has a great live set.  They are definitely above bar level.  Food is good and great beers on tap. Plus patio is killer."}
{"text":"Wow, there's quite a few reviews here that are highly critical of a place that's barely been open for two months! Heck, when I started my new job, I didn't know what I was doing for at least 3 months... Anyway, let's give some credit to the folks who decided to open a microbrew / gastropub down in the Slope during this sh*t recession! That being said, we rolled in on a Thursday night on a friend's recommendation and they earned two new customers. I had the beer flight to sample the menu, and LOVED three of them, liked three of them, and was appreciative of the other two. The crab dip was made with actual crab - not the Krab, cream cheese and mayo that my Midwestern friends seem to think is the gold standard. It's a must-have. Any eatery that has the moral turpitude to support and serve local AZ farmers and butchers' products get a tip of the cap from me. We had the sausage plate, and although I can probably get the sausages from a variety of places, the cooking and presentation was spot on. That, and the mashed potatoes rivaled that of me dear old mum's in terms of pure deliciousness. I want to go back on a packed Friday or Saturday to see if we get the same level of service (fantastic, by the way,) and to sample the rest of the menu.  The point is, Yelpers, you screwed me by not supporting my favorite local Thai place (Sa Bai Dee) and they went under. Don't break my heart again by flaming this place before they even have a chance to sort out the kinks. Keep going, bring your friends, and support your neighbors that had the gusto to open a proper gastropub. Yes, good help is hard to find; yes, they need to find their voice when it comes to the beer menu, and YES we need to team up and help a beer loving locavore put a checkmark in the \"win\" column."}
{"text":"First restaurant we decided on upon arrival from the Phoenix airport. The beer is outstanding, twenty beers on tap! If I were able to drink more, I would. Our waitress showed us exceptional service and helped us decide what meal we should get. I'm impressed.  Atmosphere is warm and the place is super clean. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"I drove out of my way to try this place. I had a sampler of all of their beers and I enjoyed the IPA and red ale, but overall was not thoroughly impressed by the beers. I love stouts and didn't care much for theirs. I was surprised that their blonde ale was decent since I don't usually care for lighter ales, but it had a coffee taste to it somehow.  The food was much better. I tried the cheese and meat plate which was very good. The lumpia was ok but the peanut sauce that came with it was to die for. Then I had the brussel sprouts as well as the cauliflower. Let me tell you. I love cauliflower and theirs was pretty good. I have not had brussel sprouts since I was about 8 and didn't much care for them then, but it was the description and the fact that they were on the menu that was intriguing, plus the fact that my server highly suggested them. They were soooooo amazing!!! I'm not even a huge veggie lover but I cannot convey to you how delicious these brussel sprouts were. Get them! I will go all the way back just for those, and probably have the IPA."}
{"text":"One of my fave brewery's and date night with the hubby. Beer is excellent and food is amazing. Owners are wonderful and super nice. Staff is helpful and awesome."}
{"text":"So after hearing about this place for so long, we finally went.  Ordered a flight of 12. AND the poutine, which was amazing btw.  The beers. Not one of the 12 did I hate. Most of their beers I really liked, (not a fan of I.P.A).  Everything was really awesome. We are excited to go back! Lol  Beer: tasty Food: awesome, fresh, delicious Service: can't complain!  Price: right on point. Going back? DEF!"}
{"text":"Go try this new place! I The atmosphere is great, and the food is even better.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to try their brews... I am a light beer drinker and they were out.  I took it as a sign it was good. I will be back to try it!   Menu items were everything from burgers and fish and chips to a vegetable kale salad.   They had live music and great service... you won' t be disapointed."}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp, was in the area at John C Lincoln Hospital. Staff is very friendly, atmosphere is somewhat German in that there are long tables next to each other so strangers get to mix if wanted. Walls also have TV's all across with Sports on them. Got a Flight of 6 beers, I'm not an IPA fan and don't like Hoppy beers, so I wont comment on them, there was a CREME that was very tasty. We had the sausage plate and ham and cheese (it had bacon in it). Food was good and priced right, if Im in the area I will see them again."}
{"text":"Cool place in Sunnyslope. Went on a quiet Saturday afternoon and enjoyed the hot wings(might fine I might add) and a couple cold beers. They love the blues here as this is what played on the speakers the whole time we visited. Serious beer, cool vibe and service was decent. Wala!"}
{"text":"Came here for the blues brews n arts fest. It was a hot April day! There was a mixed crowed of old n young. The music was pretty good. We bought beers inside to get out of the heat for a lil. The CREEM was my favorite. They had a chocolate sour that wasn't really up any of our alleys. But I'm not a sour fan anyways. They gave us the saison in like a tiny almost Dixie cup. I understand it's a higher ABV but don't charge $7 for such a lil cup. The vendors n artists outside varied from T-shirts, jewelry, paintings, n such. We didn't have any food. Might come back after checking out other breweries in the area."}
{"text":"Very pleasant restaurant, food was very good and great beer selection. Beers on tap with some seasonal beers and beers aged for a year, best flavors.  The flavors of the food items are made with the highest ingredients livening amazing tastes."}
{"text":"North Mountain is a great little brewery. The selection of beers is wide and wonderful. The NM burger is delicious and the only thing wrong with the mussels is that there are never enough. The white wine garlic butter sauce they swim in is the perfect dip for the sour dough bread.  They have a decent size patio and often have bands playing inside. This is a great addition to the Sunny Slope area."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fun. I had a Kaiserlich: Dunkle Weiss. Brewed right here and full of complex delicious flavors.   Also enjoyed their wings. Spicy and big. I should have asked for ranch not a fan of blue cheese, but the wings were great.  Service was on. Always there and great suggestions. The place is all dressed up for the month in proper Oktobest style."}
{"text":"This was one of the few breweries we had not yet gone to in the Phoenix metro area. The interior was decent, although I didn't need to see the entire kitchen area, which was directly behind the bar. Otherwise, the decor was cute, and I liked that there was outdoor seating for those sunny days. As far as the beer, we were not impressed. It isn't bad, but nothing stood out and had that rich or unique flavor we're used to from all of the other places across the valley. If you're an IPA fan, I suggest looking elsewhere. A flight of all 8 beers cost $14, a bit steep in my opinion. Overall, an okay place to stop if you're in the area, but not really worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Stopped by when I was in the area with my family because I remembered a friend mentioning the brewery. The staff was very friendly and the food was GREAT! I am a beer lover and I got to say one of the best local breweries in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Walked in to NMB for the first time and was\"greeted\" by the hostess that wasn't that friendly. No greeting.... just \" how many\". Ugh... 2 please. Dropped the menus off at the table and left.  At that point.... I thought this place was going to be a bust. But Lo and Behold... Emilee was our server.  This wonderful young lady made our night! Ordered several small beers for tasting before deciding on bigger beers!  Ordered the garlic Parmesan fries and a pizza and the Shepard's pie. The food was incredible.  Not sure what I was expecting? Maybe \"bar\" food? It was anything but! Delicious.  A great place with fantastic beer. Family owned and operated. Beer brewed on premise.  I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has great feel inside, awesome staff, some of the best beer in AZ, and actually delicious food!! If you don't like beer, then you should still visit for the food!"}
{"text":"Great new little brewery on the Northernmost border of the area I'd call North Central.  Great food, good beer, community drinking hall style tables and Oyster menu.  I repeat.  Oyster menu.  How many places in Phoenix can you escape to for mid day  Beer Oysters and Soccer?    Really hope more people decide to give this place a chance-"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The beer was outstanding.  The food was ok.  My husband had the Poutine and he loved it.  I had the fish and chips.  They were a bit dry.  The ahi tuna was good but warmer than I would have liked.  The warm pretzel appetizer was very good.  My daughter had the hamburger of the day, which was a Nacho Burger.  She said it was ok but the bun fell apart right away.  I would go again for the beer."}
{"text":"Looking at the slew of mostly 4-5 star reviews, I must've come on an off night...but it was Sunday, and the place wasn't that full. Whatevs.  I get seated almost immediately and was served the Buddha-something beer, I forget but it wasn't bad at all! The waitress was nice and super swift, and almost literally because she was darting back and forth from kitchen/bar pass to dining...  ...which leads me to believe they were understaffed. I sipped on my beer and it was almost gone, when my food finally came. About 15-20 min wait.  My Southwest burger was luke warm at very best...flavor was meh. It had to have been sitting at an unheated pass for a little bit. The fries....I have no clue if these were even fries...they're crunchy strings of blah!  Mainly the good beer and the fast-and-best-we-can service on this given night is what kept this from a lower rating. Unsure if I'll be back, and I'm currently local to this part of town."}
{"text":"North Mountain Brewing Co. is definitely one of my favorite local places to eat, hands down. It is fairly close to our house, but we would drive a great distance to continue to regularly go here...it's that good! We go here on a once a week basis. Their beer menu is wonderful, and every single beer is full of flavor and unique. The food is FRESH and beyond delicious. I always have a hard time ordering something new because each meal is so amazing I want to keep ordering the same thing, but every time I try something different I have a NEW FAVORITE! My top choices are the steak sandwich, fish and chips, the North Mountain burger, and the shepherd's pie (which is MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious). I love the family business feel, and the owner is always on-site making sure everything is running smoothly and all the customers are happy. I feel so lucky to have found a place my fianc√© and I can eat at and feel like we're home and feel like family. We love it so much, we're even considering serving their beer at our wedding in Sedona. Do NOT pass this place up. It is a local gem."}
{"text":"I am typically not at a loss for words for a review, but this place is jaw droppingly  WOW.  Atmosphere: If any of you have ever read Jim Butcher's Dresden Files? Welcome to Macanally's Pub. 13 Wood Tables in the joint, 13 chairs at the bar, 13 Air Conditioning vents. (I'm a nerd so sue me), but the best part? Steak Sandwiches! We will get to that in a minute though. It was a casual relaxed atmosphere, the staff was extremely friendly, and we even took our 5 year old and he had a blast. (Note: There were other kids in there, and it wasn't awkward). I would LOVE to have a board game night here. The tables and atmosphere are PERFECT for it.  Food: We started off with the Pretzel Bread (Its a bread stick right out of the oven that is a Pretzel) with what I can only assume to be made from scratch mustard, butter, and beer cheese. My husband and I fought over the mustard and beer cheese. Then dinner came. My husband had the Poutine (Cheese Curds, Braised Short Ribs, Fries and Gravy)...let me tell you...this was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.....until I had my steak sandwich. This thing was straight from the Dresden Files. Fresh Bread, excellent steak, onions, peppers, and a gravy that would make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. This thing was heavenly. As a side, we got the loaded mac and cheese. DO THIS. Just trust me, you are going to look at it and say ..peas? Seriously? Shut up and do it. I don't know who the chef is there, but BRAVO! The little man had their Pepperoni Flat bread Pizza and though  Drink: My husband and I ordered a flight of beer. My favorite was the Creem (spelled correctly) and the Stout. You may be sitting here nodding, but let me explain. ....I loathe stout beer. I hate it, I wont drink it. I would drink their stout by the pitcher. One warning it is rich, sip responsibly. The hubby enjoyed their lager, and the Creem as well as others.    Hands down if you have not been to this place, you need to go NOW. It was absolutely amazing, and we will be returning customers."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night (Wed), good crowd but no problem getting a table. I ordered the beer sampler and each beer was very good. Much better then some of the other new breweries I've been to recently. For an app, we split the crab dip and it was good, but could have used more crackers, otherwise, creamy and tasty and chunks of crab. I had the fish n chips for dinner and that was very good too, not too big of a portion but with the appetizer, it was perfect. My child ordered the corn dog and fries, very good, not a carnival type corn dog, it was very good. I may get that next time. My girlfriend ordered a burger, unfortunately it was overcooked, she said it was tasty but she likes them medium rare and this was medium and then some. The service was great, our waitress was friendly, knew the menu, and attentive. We'll be coming back, hopefully after they get the last of their beers they offer on the menu."}
{"text":"The beer was great, almost on par with four peaks, the service was great also. It looses one star on the food. The \"eggplant flatbread\" was a cheese pizza with some giant slices of egg plant on it, and the oysters seemed small.  The other dishes we ordered (fish and chips, shepards pie, and bai min) where all pretty good. Id definatley go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service for a private party of 25.  Beautiful presentation of all the food."}
{"text":"Good food. Good beers. Good service. I enjoy this local brewery and their unique beer offerings. Highly recommended! Favorite beer here: pict Scottish red ale."}
{"text":"Got talked into going twice to give it a second chance by some beer lovers.  Stayed away from the seafood this time and enjoyed a nice cheeseburger, not super huge but very tasty. Service was better as the place was not busy as before. The beers will still need to improve for the long haul to compete with other brew pubs but the food was a big improvement over this past weekend. Stay away from the seafood and you should be safe."}
{"text":"By far the best variety of local beer in north central Phoenix, and a step above most other breweries in the west valley."}
{"text":"I went back to @NMTBrew tonight, because it's really that amazing.  Amy was our server. She quickly informed us that the guest brew, the Pumpkin Porter, was out, and that they had just that hour tapped the Mountain Stout.  I sampled it, as well as their Mild Child, a \"succulent blonde\".  The blonde was nice, but it's beginner beer.  The Stout, however, definitely for refined palettes.  Just had some crab dip for dinner.  Was very pleasantly surprised to have a visit from owner/brewmaster Rob, who came to discuss the Stout.  We discussed many different things, and I congratulated him on he, and Candy's success with their venture.  Sitting on the patio was initially a bit warm, but by the time we left, it was a nice night.  Can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Great place... my wife and I bring our 1 year old here early evenings.  Fun environment and great food.  The mac and cheese is AWESOME.  Crab dip is really good.  The growler refill deal is good too if you come in semi regularly.   Live music Friday and Saturday at 7pm is nice too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff! Loved the beer here! I ordered the purplesaurus and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with the atmosphere. Beer I had was fantastic and samplers where awesome as well. We also hung out with one of the brewers which was top notch for my boyfriend because he is a home brewer. Can't wait to come back and try the food."}
{"text":"The poutine is awesome and alot of it.  The fish and chips are great as well.  I'm not mutch of a micro-brew person, but they always have one that I like."}
{"text":"We're thrilled to have a locally owned brew pub in the neighborhood!  I'm especially impressed that they source many ingredients from local farmers.  They were a bit slammed the evening we stopped in to try it out - in their defense, it was the night of the art walk in Sunnyslope - so service was a bit slow but understandable given the volume of patrons pouring in the door.   We enjoyed the beer sampler - my fave was the stout!  We decided to share a few dishes - the burger n fries, the brussels sprouts and the crab dip.  All were just delicious!  Looking forward to trying some of the salads offered on the seasonal menu too!  The atmosphere is comfortable, open and very friendly.  We'll be back...with friends!  PS - one wish...Root Beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Opening Beer Week Flight Menu:  James Brown Ale (ABV=4.7% / IBUs=29.8) Notes: Pours an amber brown color and as James would say \"I feel good.. Whoa!\"  Griffin ESB (ABV=5% / IBUs=41.1) Notes: A pretty good opening week beer. Pours a dark cloudy amber. Reminds me of cask ale.  Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde Ale (ABV=4.59% / IBUs=29) Notes: A light beer for me.  Patience Pays Pale Ale (ABV=5.38% / IBUs=33.5) Notes: The only beer with a hint of hops.  Mit Hefe (ABV=5.78% / IBUs=12.1) Notes: A solid cloudy Bavarian Hefewizen.  Finished with a Belguim something poured in a Tulip, I can't remember the name. It will come to me later but for now, I'm Beerly Coherent.  Snacked on the crab dip. This is a decent amount of crab with Ritz crackers. Even tho I dig the old school Ritz, I would prefer a flat, kinda flacky cracker, even saltines. Get a second cracker in the cupboard, Chef Justin. I ran out of crackers so I ordered the German pretzel bread imported and spread the remainder of my lump crab on the bread. The salt over powered the delicate crab a bit but still I was happy, BTW the bread and the three house sauces were damn good.  Next beer name request: \"The Sloper\""}
{"text":"Love this place! The beer is amazing! I love the Nefarious Dark Belgian Quad! Service is always great and the staff are always happy and attentive. I love hitting it up on a Tuesday night to visit my favorite BT here (Alisa) and enjoy a great brew."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for a cold local brew and an app. Not wide variety menu but all pretty good."}
{"text":"My honey and I had the weekends to ourselves, which is a rare occurrence and we decided to check this spot out. I've been wanting to see what it's all about for some time now, so we finally decided to head in. I think we picked the perfect night, there was a live band there by the name of KAB I believe, anyway they were amazing and played awesome music. The food was super delicious, I wasn't expecting a place that specializes in brewing beer to also deliver with awesome food. We had the wings, crab dip, and small pizza. My person had 2 beers and I 2 Sangria. The drinks were great, Sangria can be a difficult thing for some places to pull off, and I even liked the beer, my pallet hasn't reached the \"beer is awesome\" stage yet. Wings were really flavorful, pizza even had some heat, I think they used a rosemary and jalapeno crust, and the crab dip.. well you can't really go wrong with crab dip. It was so good. I also ordered the Brussels sprout salad but our server forgot, and that was a perfect mistake because we were soo full. :)  Another great thing about this place is I saw people from all ages there on Friday Night. The age range was pretty awesome and something you just don't see too much of unless your in some chain restaurant. I saw ages ranging from 5-6 to 60's easy. A lot of young adults ranging 19-26 too. Great Beer, good vibes, awesome music, and delicious food you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"What a great brewery and restaurant! Family owned small craft beer and it's well made. Food is delicious! We had the mountain burger and lumpia for an appetizer, perfectly cooked. Staff were friendly and warm. The restaurant itself is cozy and welcoming. Will definitely come back next time I am in Phoenix.... such a relaxed, cool place."}
{"text":"Meat pizza was very good.  Not a single one of their regular offering beers is above average yet.  Their pazookie (\"spent grain cookie\") is delicious, but for $8 should be much bigger.  It's about a third of the size of Oregano's pazookie.  Can't wait for the beer to catch up to the food quality.  I've been their twice, and both times the server was refreshingly honest about which beers they thought were subpar."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer.  We had the best waiters very friendly and new her beer.  She provided free tasting until my wife found found a beer of her liking. The wings are not giant like the menus claims, but we had their house hot sauce and it was very flavorful.  I would've liked it hotter but it was just right for my wife it was delicious and I go back for more"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, but most were tapped, good ambiance, food selection, but the service mirrored Rita Pearlman while on the rag. There weren't even crackers for the soup!!!"}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar.   The Banh Mi I ordered was pretty bland, and the burger is overpriced. I had to order the banh mi like 3 times and point to it on the menu because the server said he didn't know what it was. Once he read the decription, he said \"oh yeah - that's new but its my favorite thing on the menu.\" Wait, what?  We ordered a beer flight, and they don't have any of those cool trays that hold the glasses, or even printed placemats that describe each beer, yet. Maybe if they ever firm up the beer selection they will. The flight wasn't bad - but it had a couple of guest brews in substituting for their brews that they were out of.  Since this is the closest brewpub to our house, I had growlers with me. I didn't even walk out to the car to get one. I was hoping for a nice rich porter to fill them with - and they didn't have any that day.  Their saving grace was the Abita Purple Haze on tap. I like Abita beers, but out of all the beers in the flight we tried...I went with the Abita. That's not how it should work at a brewery, unless your guest beer is something like a Pliny or a Stone rarity."}
{"text":"Totally a chill place to hang out and have good beer and food with real people. So glad I found this place in Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"This was one of six breweries I visited on a recent trip to Arizona, and it was an overall pleasant experience. I got a flight of 8 beers (bonus points for large pours) and was able to try the Hoy IPA, Spiral Man stout, James Brown Ale, PT 42 red, Hefe Endings, the Creem Ale, and the Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde.   Overall I enjoyed most of the selection.   The servers seemed a little annoyed with each other and seemed slightly passive aggressive with their conversations; maybe have those talks in the back away from the customers."}
{"text":"Five out of Five forks.   First time here had the poutine. This time around had the surf and turf burger.  Food is amazing. Beer selection is very good.  Enjoyed the CREEM golden ale and the Belay Double IPA.  The IPA is delicious.  Staff is super friendly. Brought a few friends for dinner and we all had a great experience."}
{"text":"4 star category because it met all my expectations. The menu is amazing I wish I had more stomachs to try it all but just enough to have a beer and share the southwest burger I added an egg to that because the combination will make your eyes roll back. The decor is industrial yet cozy . Enough TVs to watch if you want or not. Service was great. I will come back and this says a lot . It's easy to review when you have a bad experience but it's also easy to shout out what's great and what made you feel good. NMB did that for me"}
{"text":"Good food, entertainment, lots of beer... loved the brussel sprout salad.  Other food choices were good too."}
{"text":"Only sampled the beer which was great! Sort of a weird location but it's up near the north mountains which made for a pretty drive! Try the baby Belgium it was perfect for a hot afternoon."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here. The first visit was on a Sunday afternoon.  The brews were delish and the food was nothing special (ploughmans platter and sampler).  The second visit was after work on a Friday and the service, food (north mountain burger), and beer (Belgian) were great. 5 stars for that night. Tonight, however is a completely different story. My brother in law chose North Mtn for his birthday dinner destination, as he normally has a good experience here. We waited NINETY MINUTES (plus!) for our food. My 'Caesar' salad was literally a plate of lettuce. No croutons (the menu description had croutons listed as an ingredient),  and no Parmesan Romano blend cheese, just a plate of limp romaine with a breast of grilled chicken. We dined with a party of 12, and everyone's entree came out 10 mins apart. When bringing this to the manager's attention, she replied \"I'll be right back\" and never came back to check that these problems had been corrected. We asked the waiter for some bread (at this point it was 8 pm and out entire group was extremely hungry), and he brought out fried pieces of pita. No butter. No bread. Not even a soft pretzel ( one of the menu items).  All of our water glasses were empty as well. What a waste of time and money! Still waiting for the check too!  We asked for it THIRTY mins ago..."}
{"text":"Dined in this evening for my boyfriend's birthday because we're staying at the Hilton down the street and heard great things about this place! Got seated right away and had amazing service. The highlight was the amazing vibe from the live classic rock/country performer!"}
{"text":"Delicious shepherds pie and just the right size. The beer flight was awesome and very thankful the waiter offered suggestions. Very relaxed, good food and there was live music which was my favorite part."}
{"text":"I realize that they've only been open a month but I just couldn't overlook many glaring problems at North Mountain Brewing...   First and foremost was the beer selection:  they only had 2 of they're own beers, a Hefeweizen and ESP (both pretty good) and they only had 1 hoppy guest beer.  I'd describe the food menu as bizarre, there are more oyster choices than main dishes or appetizers and the main dishes included things like Poutine and Banger.  My suggestion is to check out their website before you decide to go.  You'll notice something else bizarre - that there's no mention of beer on it.  And you can see for yourself the odd food choices.  One last tip - the lunch menu is much smaller than what's listed on-line."}
{"text":"I just found my new go-to spot for lunch and dinner!  The food here is amazing, and their lumpia is some of the best I have ever had in my life, and I'm Filipino so I know good lumpia when i taste it. They were perfectly crispy, superbly rolled, and served with a delicious thai sauce in addition to the traditional sweet & sour. The grilled cheese and chicken sandwich were also both excellent.  I love IPAs and their Ipacious definitely didn't disappoint. Full of hops, just like I like it, and served in a proper 16 oz pint glass. My only recommendation to the restaurant is to add more IPAs to the lineup because you did such a phenomenal job with the Ipacious. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I visit regularly and are always discovering new favorite brews at North Mountain Brewing Co.! Never pretentious or stuffy, we always enjoy our time seated and served at the bar by the always attentive and personable Anthony. Welcoming, comfortable, and offering consistently great meals and craft beer, North Mountain Brewing Co. is a gem of a place that has found success appealing to anyone and everyone who enters their door. Come as you are and leave vowing to return!"}
{"text":"Nice little gem right here. I am usually never ever in this area, but we happened to have a team lunch here and one of the team members suggested it..   Nice littel brewery, with a little asian/filipino theme for food selections. Lumpia .... yumm,,,  ok, Staff were very nice and tentative, I sampled the Octomalt  not too bad a little dry tasting, but decent.. Then I had the Spiral Man a dark oatmeal stout,, yumm, very smooth, could definitly drink a few of these, then close off the drinks, i tried the Baby Belgian, aslo very well flavored nice and mellow..   Food: Asian Sliders, great flavor, and the fried onion strings added a good taste, but the dinner roll /bun as a little on the small / soggy quick side, I am not a huge fan of the pretzel buns since \"everyone\" uses em now, but over all Was very good..   I would drive a little out of my way to hit this place up.. Friday afternoon lunch.,not over crowded, tables are spaced out so not bumping into people,, Great job guys ,, mabuhay !!"}
{"text":"Walked in. Walked out. The waitress actually said \"before you look at the menu, let me tell you what beers we don't have.\" Was very excited to try PT 42. They stopped making it even though it's on their website and in-store menu. They were out of 3 other beers. No ambers or reds. Just one cream. Everything else was pale or hefe. I get that handles rotate, but have some variety. And PT 42 should never be retired."}
{"text":"Almost hidden as it seems like a bike or auto shop from the street. Pretty busy on a week night and the staff was very friendly. Brewery feel and a great atmosphere. Tried the Poutine for the first time. I cant compare it to others but it was pretty good. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at NMB, but I visited last night around 8pm and sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender (a woman with short blonde hair) complained the whole time about having to move the beer glasses.  I don't care, I'm there to have a nice time.  She didn't check on whether I needed anything, and did not fill my glass until I literally flagged her down and asked her to do so. As usual the food was good but with service like this I am reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Daughter and I went for lunch, while lunch menu is limited both items we ordered were so good.  I got the pastrami which was so yummy, the fries while I try to stay clear of were very light and tasty.  I absolutely love location, creating new business in older area.  I tried the peach beer on draft, it was yummy.  Service was great, Amber was never far and made she we were good often."}
{"text":"Just happened to drive this place when looking for some grub and it was a very nice surprise.   Great beer, great food, great service."}
{"text":"Overall: For a \"gastropub\" this place is legit, craft brew with fancy food (healthy options available)  Pros: -all their beer selection is their own craft brew -they have plenty of healthy options -they use local ingredients when possible -the food is really flavorful -great chill ambience -service was great and friendly  Cons: -kitchen closes at 9pm on week nights -they only sell their own craft brew (hopefully this isn't a con)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their beer and the food. My favorite beer they make is the Brown ale.  Another must try is the Saison!  They have a salad made out of brussel sprouts that was amazing.  They sautee it!  I recently had \"fried brussel sprout salad at a fancy new Japanese restaurant in Vegas and this was much better. Their mussels are good too.  I also tried the ahi tuna salad which was also very good. I have not gotten around to trying any entrees or sandwiches yet."}
{"text":"This review is for the food.  While taste was good, they greatly overweight the breads, potatoes, and pizza crust, for actual ingredients. Where's the beef??  I would not go back."}
{"text":"We had the lobster dip appetizer, big kids burger, kids cheesy noodles, steak sandwich, and the sausage platter. The ambiance here is great but our kids plates were served 10 minute's before us and then our plates had hot and cold spots. Food was ok, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The service is so bad and the beer is inconsistent, at least they had some this time. The food was great but I don't know why it took over an hour to get it. Long story short I will not be returning to this place. Whoever owns this establishment should look for a new line of work."}
{"text":"Great brews and really good pub food!  North Mountain Brewing is in an area of the valley we rarely get to.  Luckily, an alumni volunteer event got us to drive to this side of town.  After the event we were looking to try a new spot, in a place we were unfamiliar with, and Yelp pointed us here!  Thank you Yelpers!  We ordered wings and poutine.  The wings were good (house hot sauce wasn't very hot), but the poutine... well... the poutine was sinfully delicious.  Salty, savory, and cheesy.  Oh man, it feels so good to be so bad.  For beer, we ordered the ALTerior Motive, IPAcious, and the Baby Belgian.  Great quality brews with well rounded flavors and some unique flavor profiles.    Service was friendly and timed very well.  They gave great advice about the food and beer.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!!!!!! Saw that their was a brewery not to far from my house so I had to go check it out. It's a small location, but a great find. They have beers that they are constantly brewing on site and switching out the menu constantly. I ended up talking to the bartender or a good amount of time and he invited us to the back where one of the brewers gave us a private tour and breakdown on how the beers are brewed, step by step.  If you're a beer enthusiast, like myself, I would suggest checking out the beer flights to get a little taste of everything. One of my personal favorite was the James Brown Ale?i think that was the name.  I really want to come back when they have live music. It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to NMB and had to look hard for the entrance but put that aside I really enjoyed their flight of beers especially the lighter ones. Tasty! I had the crab dip, pretzels, and fish 'n chips. Hint of spice in the fish batter! Yummy! Staff friendly. Clean tables and room. I felt very comfortable and was satisfied when I left!"}
{"text":"So we also went to the soft-opening.  In that, I'm patient with the service issues which were more than present.  Our 4 dinners were brought out one at a time, about 5-10 minutes apart.  I watched as server after server wandered around the room asking \"did you order...?\"  My biggest issues here were definitely the problems I don't see them resolving with some simple management.  1. I like beer.  I like craft brews and love microbreweries because you can get something completely new.  Not here. I tried every beer they had on tap, except the one they said wasn't ready yet.  The pale ale was decent, but murky and boring. The hefe had a strong vinegar smell, but luckily tasted a little bit better with a strong banana residual flavor.  The James Brown nut ale had the most character, but at the end of the night, was just a nut brown.  The ESB was boring...little flavor and too dark for the style.  Overall, I enjoyed the guest taps much more.  The Great Divide saison and the Four Peaks black IPA were much more interesting and worth calling craft beers.   2. The food. What a disaster.  I sat with a group of 4.  We ordered their pretzel bread, which I think is just rye bread with pretzel salt on it.  It didn't have much flavor.  The three dips it came with were decent though. I don't eat seafood so the choices for dinner were limited.  There was chicken, burger, bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie.  We ultimately ordered three of these.  Which all came out about 5-10 minutes apart.  The chicken was a drumstick and thigh on about 3/4 cup rice.  VERY salty and mostly just a teriyaki taste. The bangers and mash are one sausage on lumpy mashed potatoes. The shepherd's pie was good, all six bites of it. The burger was forgotten about and reordered.  It came out rare, not medium-well as ordered.  It was ok, but I've had much better burgers that didn't cost $14.  Overall, I would eat before you go, and be willing to know that any beer you get here you can get pretty much anywhere else.  Until they get more creative with beers, and reasonable with thier food prices/portions we will not be going again.    What a shame."}
{"text":"We have been talking about coming to this place for a couple months. We finally went in last night for the first time. From the outside, the restaurant seems nice; however, it's not in the greatest part of town. The inside of the restaurant does not look like a typical brewery. The bar is small for a brewery. We got seated immediately, but it seemed like the service was kind of slow, but very friendly! They have a great selection of beers--the two we tried were really good. The menu is somewhat limited, but that is expected for a brewery. We had the lumpia for an appetizer, despite the funny name, it was really good! We got the bacon grilled cheese and the southwest burger--both great. We definitely plan on being back."}
{"text":"I had a great time tonight with friends!  First time at North Mountain Brewing Co.  Good service, good food and good live music. Not sure who the musican was but amazing flute playing (think jethro tull)! Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is it's a bit loud when you have a large group talking together and the waitress started out letting us know the beer specials were on some wall when you enter the building rather than just telling us or giving a specialty menu. Kinda strange but you easily get past it with their good service and food. Btw had the heffiweisen beer. Yum."}
{"text":"Service here was good.  When we came in it was pasta night and it smelled delicious.  The tasting samplers here are HUGE.  So be prepared if you ordered one of those. In my opinion their brews aren't that great.  Just not my taste.  I also didn't care much for the old timey folk music band they had playing.  I would try this place again, maybe just try a different night and avoid the brews."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group for the hike and brew UYE. The service was really good for having such a large party (around 20 people). They have a large selection of house brewed beers. I tried the hef and it was very tasty. The husband had the cream and enjoyed it very much, it was kind of sweet for a cream and very tasty. We shared the poutine and it was alright, it consisted of thick cut fries (unlike the fries they serve with sandwiches which are thin), cheese curds, gravy, and short rib. The short rib was good and fairly plentiful, it was cooked to the point where it was falling apart... very nice. The overall flavor of the poutine was good, but not the best I had ever had. Despite this, I would get it again. Additionally, it was only 12$ and was plenty of food for 2 people.  I would certainly come here for the beer again in the future.   PS they had amazing sounding desserts.... def want to try that."}
{"text":"This place has potential, but needs a bar rescue. There were maybe 50 customers and at least 11 staff. Most of the staff spent the 90 minutes we were there standing in the corner. The manager is a waste of money. He never left the corner by the POS machine. A few of the beers were good, but a few were horrible. We had to wave down someone to bring us water. The table full of people who arrived 15 minutes after us received their beers before we did. The food was not prepared fresh. Obviously heating frozen food in their pizza oven. I took pictures if the large group of 8 employees who spent the entire evening chatting in the corner."}
{"text":"It is finally great to have a good microbrew and gastropub in north phoenix! We have been here a few times. The beer and food keep getting better. I highly recommend the belagian ale, mighty tasty. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"First time, great, I mean GREAT beer selection.  I got a 6-glass flight, all were worth a pint.  Lot of tables, lots of parking. We will definitely make this a routine stop."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find. Great food, music and BEER! Loved the beer. Tried the Belay Slave IPA and found it very Hoppy. My wife wanted the N.B.I. but they just ran out and won't have any for 8 to 9 months.  So sad. Had the 3 Strings Porter and liked it.  Food was fantastic.  They had a live band when we arrived that waa great.  So good. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"So, I gave a lone star as My friends and I had a miserable time there 2 weeks ago when we went to check out the new brewery in our hood. I am a beer enthusiast and always try to drink from the local brewers instead of the giants. Atmosphere is really nice, looks clean and real simple set up, a true German style brewery. The service SUCKS! the lady who served us, was least interested in her job nor knew anything about it. It makes me wonder how she passed the interview, or was there one at all?! She offered no description of the beers nor the specials nor the brewery philosophy etc. We had to ask her to tell us about the 6 types of their brew and she told us they are on the board on the wall and we can look it up. We did!  Food was nothing special. The beers were ok I guess (we were so aggravated by the service that didn't care about the beer). We shortly left and had never gone back.  I will give them another try as this may have been a fluke with the crappy server who simply didn't care for the owner nor her job! More review to follow later."}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer to this place! I was totally impressed with the beer selection; so many options! The pretzel bread is a good snack, but the cheese sauce offered as an add-on is nothing special. I liked the mustard and sweet butter dipping sauces though. If you go here, save room for dessert. The fry bread is truly decadent and very addicting: hot, crispy bread pieces smothered in honey with warm beer chocolate for dipping. I split this with three friends, and everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good place, the lumpia was OUTSTANDING and they had a decent selection of mead."}
{"text":"Great pub type atmosphere...meet the brewmaster....nice guy and makes a very good session IPA...wings and Brussels Sprouts ?...friendly and helpful staff...relaxed not too noisy,low key...great craft beer snob type place.    Really worth trying. !"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. It reminds me of the little gasthauses I always seemed to hang out in Germany. The staff is friendly and I love the beer. They are still working some of the kinks out, but nothing major and I'm sure that with a few more months under their belts it will be a smooth operation. The food is very tasty, but I can't recommend eating here - it is just too expensive.  So to wrap it up, fun, open, inviting place to hang out at and the tables are huge, so invite your friends or better yet make some new friends. Once the food prices/portion sizes are adjusted this could be the go to place. I really hope NMB can make a go of it, the Sunnyslope neighborhood could really use a few more fun spots like this."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place by accident, literaly drive by every day and didn't know it was there. Well worth the effort to find parking. All I've had so far is burgers and frys but they were awesome. Dine in once takeout once and both times awesome food. My buddy said beer was excellent as well. Restaurant was nice, clean, and the service was great. Will be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and now it's my ONLY taco Tuesday place. There is a beer for EVERY taste and the employees are all so friendly. Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Disappointing evening at NMB.  The beer was not cold enough and when we asked we were told that this was the brewers decision because he felt that being to cold they didn't bring the flavor.   If the beer is warmer than the customer wants or expects, then they are not serving the customer.   The waitress was not well versed in the various beers as we tried the flights.   Very disappointing since I brought out of town guests.   Can't imagine going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Out of beer?  How does a brewery run out of nearly all of its own beers?  Thank goodness they had a few guest taps, but even then they weren't exactly stellar choices (The Grand Canyon one, yuck).    So I, too, anxiously awaited this place opening but I read the bad reviews of the first few weeks.  I thought it best to give them a month or so to work out any issues.  Well, I'm quite surprised at the beer issue and the rather restricted list of menu items.  One key flaw was that you can't order from a brewpub-appropriate appetizer list in the in-between meal times.  I'm there at 2:30 and my only choices were full portion lunch items.  And not only that, I don't think they're offering enough non-seafood items either.  A lot of people just don't like seafood, and a brewery/brewpub is going to draw a very general crowd of hungry patrons (unlike seafood restaurants per se where it is understood in advance they'll probably just have seafood options).  Parking was very challenging in the back and it's not exactly a nice part of town.  Service was polite.  Food I did receive was fine, but nothing great.  Prices reasonable.  Last and most important though I didn't think their house beers were very good.  But I'm withholding some judgment on this because I was unable to try most of them."}
{"text":"We love this brewery. We started coming here not too long after they first opened and it's been fun to watch all the growth and changes. They have great bartenders who actually know the products they serve. You would think that is normal, but, trust me, it's NOT! This team knows their beers and actually act interested in knowing you are enjoying your drink. The servers are friendly and full of great suggestions for drinks and food. Food...yum! We love all the new and interesting specials and many standards on the menu. The one negative I do have isn't enough to dock a star, but is worth mentioning. Portion size and preparation seems to depend on the chef of the day. For example, we have been served their delicious REAL shepherd's pie in no less than 3 different sizes, all for the same price, all at dinner time. Hmmmmm. But, their burgers are high quality, cooked to order. Their salads are amazing, especially the brussels sprout one. Their pizzas are so good too. Can't go wrong! You will love your experience at North Mountain!"}
{"text":"Without having the food I can't comment fully. But the beer is nice. The styles are true to form and decent representations at that. The red ale is quite impressive, has a nice hoppy punch for being a red. The ipa is solid and a nice west coast style. The brown had a good malty tone with some coffee flavor either added or from the toasted malts. The serendipitous Belgian dark was fun, nice and sweet with a good Belgian yeast flavor. All in all pretty impressed with the quality of the beer, they certainly know how to brew and add a little flair to the styles that they make."}
{"text":"As awesome as a brewing company can be. Great beer - I mean it. There wasn't one brew we didn't love. The service - terrific and attentive. Thanks so much!! And the food - the mussels were amazing, the pretzel bread was the best ever. This location has a lot going for it. It's one of those place I don't want people to know about because it'll get too crowded, but I want everyone to know about it because it is so damn good."}
{"text":"Nice place in Sunnyslope that has decent food and brews.  Friendly staff and it's nice to see the area being rejuvenated.  The menu us your basic gastrobrewery fare but still nice.  Local ingredients.  A nice place."}
{"text":"Location is good, they have a lot of parcking space.    Service is good.  Place is clean, though the bathroom has a strong Clorox smell.   The outside sitting is small but it's ok.  The inside set up I don't like.  They have big wood tables so if your party is 2 or 3  people you all have to sit in a table for 6-8.  Plus the tables are set up like a classroom.   The food I have eaten is here:  the pouting fries very small portion for $14, the southwest burger was ok I think it was to flavorless but the thin fries were delish, the nachos not enough of cheese and a oatmeal cookie was delicious except that it was more ice cream than cookie but if they can balance the  cookie  and the ice cream that will be great.  What is great is the beer specially the purplessoures!!!  That's the reason I came back."}
{"text":"Saturday night. 4 adults, 2 kids, 1 teenager. place was busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. Was a little chilly so we opted to sit in the main dining area. They have a small patio and a small private dining room.  I ordered the sangria, hubs ordered the C.R.E.E.M., 1 male flight, 1 female flight and 3 sodas. Alcoholic beverages here get a A+. I love the sangria. It's tart, fruity and sweet.  Food. One very plain burger, 1 cheese only flatbread, 1 grilled cheese with bacon for the kids. One fish and chips, 1 crispy chicken sandwich, 1 shepherd's pie, 1 burger for the adults.  Food took a really long time which would have been ok but they brought ours plates out 1 at a time so it took about 10 minutes from 1st plate to last on our table.  My husbands burger when he took the top bun off looked liked someone had taken a huge bite out of it. He showed the waitress and the manager came over with new one with an apology. My fish was outstanding. The fish was so mild if you didn't get a bite of crispy coating it was just texture in your mouth. Excellent. The chicken sand was huge but looked like shake and bake but cooked nicely, dinig companion ate most of it. Shepherds pie dish was licked clean. All kids cleaned their plates.  Overall No. Mt. is an excellent dining choice. The service always stellar, food always tasty and it's great to meet friends or bring my family."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. It smelled unbelievably good in here like really good barbeque or bacon or something like that. It was all we could do to sit patiently while our table was set up.  Unfortunately that is where the visit turned for the worse. Our server seemed like a nice guy but just couldn't get it together. We ordered some beers and it took well over 10 minutes for him to bring our beers and come back for our order. We asked for some recommendations and took him up on the suggestions. He suggested the Justin brussel sprout salad and stated it was his absolute favorite thing on the menu. So I ordered it and it was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the \"pho\" which he stated was great...it was literally ramen straight out the package with an egg and a couple veggies. My son ordered the kid's burger. It was like a burnt meatball on a dry bun with no toppings whatsoever. My friend ordered the kale salad which she picked at then turned her nose up at. My other friend ordered the fish and chips but would have been better off \"trusting the Gordon's fisherman\".   All the poor food aside, the server then left us alone without checking on us throughout our meal. When we finished we asked the guy bussing our table to send him back over so we could order another beer. Our server took our order then hung out with the other servers at the bar/register area for 15 minutes. Eventually we decided to ditch this place to find another that would actually bring us our beers. So I walked up to the register and asked him for our checks and told him to make sure he didnt charge us for the beers he never brought us. He brought us our checks a couple minutes later and mumbled \"sorry about that\"....   We won't be back.  Edited 04/30/13 at 20:10: To address owner Candy's response below. I am not surprised to see that your professionalism suits your establishment. My review was as honest as I could possibly state it. Your \"pho\" sucked and it was definitely ramen. I cannot tell you how the kale salad tasted because I did not try it, just stating what I observed of it. As for the back-handed insult stating \"I am a mother of 3 kids- if I see a burnt meetball (sic) I would certainly not feed to my children- but I am so surprised you let your son eat it.\" At no point did I state I allowed my kid to eat it. In fact we stopped after we left your restaurant to get him a different dinner. All the food aside, we most likely would have overlooked the crappy food if the service was better and I would have provided more stars here. I am not sure what you intend by inviting me to \"call you to contact me with your honesty\". Do you want me to call you at this restaurant? You can email me directly with the best contact info if that is your intention."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here over the weekend while we were in town for Spring Training.   We arrived around 8 pm and it was about 40% full on a Thursday night. They had a cover band playing at a reasonable volume but there is no ambiance music playing when the band takes a break so it does get a little eerily quiet.   It's \"family style\" seating. So you could be sharing your large table with others. They do have a bar top which you can sit at, and a patio with heaters.  Our server seemed a little lost or new and would disappear at times. We asked for samples of a few of their beers and she gave us the wrong ones. We decided to get the Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde Ale and another one I can't remember. Both were just ok.  Appetizer - we ordered the Lumpia which are little \"spring rolls\" with pork, veggies and a really good peanut sauce. I believe 8 came with the order. $7  Main Course - North Mountain Burger w/ fries $14  and Fish and Chips $12. The  Fish and Chips didn't taste like they had been sitting in a freezer forever. The tarter sauce wasn't your normal tarter sauce but it was delicious - hints of mustard in it. The food came out quickly and hot. Nothing to rave about but it was good.  I would come here again if it was on my way to my destination or near me, definitely wouldn't seek this place out as my first choice."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I drank a dark wheat beer that was delicious, but  I can't recall the name. I ate a Chicago dog that was delicious, but the bun was a tad dry and so were the little hot peppers. The shoestring fries and the pretzel bread with the honey butter was delicious. As you've gathered from reading, this isn't a health spa! There was a lot of other food on the menu that looked like great comfort food items. I will definitely be back to try more."}
