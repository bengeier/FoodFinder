{"text":"My fish was really soggy and the fries were Luke warm.
The owner was really rude to the staff and to me.

I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I think Chippies is great.  I have a friend from Ottawa who is originally from Australia and every time she visits we go to Chippies.  It is kind of a hangover traditions for us to go get Chippies and then eat it in the park. I have tired the halibut, haddock, salmon and prawns and all are good but I prefer the white fishes and tend to go with the halibut since it is cheaper.  The chips are great and you get TONs of them.  The icing on the cake with Chippies is their dipping sauces.  I have had the garlic mayo and mushy peas but these days I am hooked on the currie.  So tastey, not spicey at all but there is something about it that I like.  As for the decor it's simple, retro-ish and has a few stools at the window to eat at and enjoy Queen West.  Loud rock/metal/punk is played and the staff always seem to be cute, attentive and fun.  Sure it could could be considered fish and chips for hipsters but since it has been around since before hipster was a bad word and the food is really good, it shouldn't really matter."}
{"text":"I have had fish n chips from all over Toronto, and I didn't think bad fish n chips existed until I tried Chippy's. I'm no fish expert but if you like to eat dry, bland tree barks, this is the place for you. I ordered a 13$ halibut (among other things), expecting it to be done right with that kind of price. The restaurant is understaffed (one at the cash and one frying) which makes the wait time incredibly long. When I received my order, \"over-cooked fish\" can not even describe its horrible brick texture that damaged my plastic fork. I think the reason why it's called Chippy's is because of how many people have chipped their tooth eating their food. As for the fries, it does not have any redeeming qualities, -and well lets just say I gave it away to a homeless guy who didn't like the fries either. Overall, I don't recommend this place to anyone, and is in serious need of a health government warning sign."}
{"text":"The potatoes they use contain too much sugar, resulting in dark brown chips with an off flavor. Fish was dry. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Chippy's serves fish and chips just as good as, if not better than any I've had in the UK. I love how the fish is made to order, cut and battered right in front of you. The fries are also fresh and cut in-house. I've tried a few different items on their very basic menu and have enjoyed everything. 

On the negative side, the place is quite small. There are about 4 stools along the window so you're much better off taking your food to the park as another reviewer suggested. I kind of wish they didn't charge extra for tartar sauce, but the fish and chips are reasonably priced at about $10 an order so I don't mind all that much.  

Cash only."}
{"text":"Food: chips were solid. fish was fresh but batter was not crispy. it had a chewy texture and was actually hard to cut through. 

Service: $1 charge to pay with debit. stupid. $1 charge for my $20 meal = 5% surcharge. who does that?  

Value: extra charge for tartar sauce? for fish and chips? seriously?!  that's like a chip truck charging you for ketchup. 

If the food was great I would overlook the annoyances. but it's not. so go elsewhere."}
{"text":"first visit had the prawns, great crispy batter and pretty good fries  with  the skin left on  and lots of crunchy  bits. Small  bench outside let's you eat your meal outside if it is raining."}
{"text":"The fish was de-lish.

Maybe I came on an off night, I didn't experience any of the negativity expressed in the previous reviews.

The hipster doofus staff were pleasant. 
There was NO obnoxious death metal playing in the background.

The fries came in an insane andre the giant sized portion. They were thick, crispy, and salty... yummmm. I can't believe I ate them all.

I ordered the cod. 
The batter was perfect and crispy, if a little greasy.
I would say that the fish was a touch overcooked, but still de-lish.

Aside from feeling a bit queasy from eating 4 potatoes worth of fries, most of which were dipped in the spicy tartar sauce (YUM), I was completely satisfied.

...the following day was another issue.

:O

Highly recommend for anyone in the mood for a little slice of fat, calories, and salt... chippy's is the perfect way to get all three in one tasty meal.

Would go back! Just need 6-8 weeks to recover from the first time."}
{"text":"Me and my Girlfriend decided to take a walk down to the AGO from a place we rented out while on vacation here. While looking for food she spotted Chippy's from across the street and both of us being fish and deep fried food people, we thought we should give them a try.

Honestly, I think we were both impressed with the food. Nice portions, tasty sauces (I had the pepper mayo, she had the garlic mayo) and the fish was fresh and the fries were awesome. She went with the Trout, the fish itself wasn't super flavourful, but the batter they cooked it in added quite a buttery compliments that we eaten together (as you should) really brought the fish alive. 

As for me, I went for the Scallops. Honestly, I have to say, I really, really enjoyed them. The batter was nice and crispy, but not to the point of hurting your gums, the seafood was soft and very flavourful. Adding the dipping sauces, you really get the full effect. Pepper mayo + Scallops = happy taste buds.

The staff here (The one guy who was working at the time) was super friendly, really chilled out vibe, interesting music selection as well.

I really recommend checking this place out if you go to the Trinity Bellwoods Park."}
{"text":"it was okay. not terrible, but not amazing. the fish wasn't impressive. the fries, very delicious. i'd go back just to get an order of fries, but i don't know if i'd wait as long as i did for them. the wait for our fries seemed unreasonably long. didn't realizing frying to so long. but then again there was only one poor guy doing everything himself.

over all, i'm glad i went and tried. if i don't go back, oh well."}
{"text":"Old school fish and chips love.

This is where you go when you have that craving for the real deal, the kind of chips (fries) that bring back memories of crisp afternoons, ice skating with your dad. Comfort food on max.

There isn't really anything special about the actual spot. It's more of a takeout joint then an eat in place. They have a few seats, but it's really not a date joint.

I seem to only like them in the winter. That's when the fries cravings come out in full force."}
{"text":"After going out of our way to stop for fish and chips to take into Trinity Bellwood's Park I was a little disappointed with the fare - I doubt that the fryers were hot enough so everything came greasy and soggy.  Price is such that I expected better.  I will give them another chance though because they seemed earnest and service was quick."}
{"text":"While the scallops were good,  never have I had actual beer batter coated halibut - very distasteful.  Also sticky surfaces & dead flies in the window."}
{"text":"Chippy's in Queen West = the dirtiest food establishment handling raw seafood in plain eyesight that I have EVER come across. It is unbelievable how they get through inspections. I mean, come on, folks, look around. Just take a peek at the top of the refrigerator, or the range hood. This is a public health disaster waiting to happen. You are dealing with fresh fish, guys! 

Some of the reviews mention this is a 'hipster place'. Now is this what a place looks like where 'hipsters' like to eat? Is it maybe part of the attraction even? Is it cool to have dodged food poisoning? Kind of a \"I dare you to eat this - man, you are so chill, you really did it', thing?

For my part, I don't get it. 

Nevertheless, I risked my life and had fish and chips and they were not bad (not that I ever had fish and chips anywhere else). A little greasy but I ate the whole thing including the Tartar sauce.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the staff being exceptionally devoid of communication skills. Customer service is almost as low a priority as cleanliness is. Perhaps this is part of the 'hipster' thing too, how knew? To not say a word to your customer? Barely notice you? You, who pays to keep this dump afloat? 

I can see myself going to this place at 3 am in the morning, fully loaded, and stuff my face with grease before passing out at home; I cannot see myself returning below the legal limit."}
{"text":"This is an unexpected treat - a place for hipsters that actually has good food!

I like to think of myself as a fried food connoisseur (or at least on my way to becoming one, based on the quantity of deep-fryer oil I consume.) For me, Chippy's produces some excellent fried goods. The haddock is hot and flaky in a thing, golden batter. The chips are short and stout and taste a lot better than I'm making them sound.

Other options include cod and halibut, as well as shrimp and scallops. One thing I don't like is that every sauce is an extra charge, aside from the bare bones lemon/ketchup/vinegar.

But the food is so good you don't really need tartar sauce. They ran out of mushy peas, which would've been nice.

Countertop seating with huge windows opening onto Trinity Bellwoods Park, perfect for West Queen West people watching, or get your order to go and brave the pigeon gangs.

Also, because it is suitably hip, it showcases a great soundtrack - the terrific Beach House album was on for my most recent visit.

About $12 for one order of fish and chips, cash only."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I don't know what people are talking about.  Maybe other things.  I think, the batter on the fish here, is one of the best that I have tried.  They have an excellent selection of fish to try.  I tried the fish cakes, very good and the sturgeon, which, was excellent.  food tastes great on it's own, no need for sauces.
The staff are friendly and happy so that is always a bonus. And they politely listened to my complaint about hours of operation.  They also seemed genuinely concerned about the issue.
The reason  I give it 4 *, is because it is kind of expensive.  I also went there on a Tuesday once bc the website said it was open (winter).  Well, it wasn't.  Not cool for a cold bike ride in February (actually, it was cool, a little too cool in fact).
But I will be back to try that sandwich."}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating tree barks, this is the place for you. I went here one day with my sis and the environment was okay. We ordered 2 cod, 2 fries and 1 tartar sauce which ended up a total of about $25. Not even worth it.

The cod was nowhere to be seen, the batter was hard as a tree bark and way over-cooked. Not even the chips were enough to redeem the nasty fish. It was just as burnt and greasy. 

My plastic utensils somehow manage to survive without them shattering into pieces, but proved useless later on, as I gave up and used my hands. 

The service was just as bad. My sis asked if there was a bottle opener for the cap of the soda, and the cook gruffly jabbed his finger by the door. Well, excuse me for not noticing something so small! As we were close to finishing our meal at 8pm, we asked him what time do they close. He replied at nine. The other worker said to him, \"You should've said at eight.\"

I manage to finish eating the tree bark but had no appetite left to finish eating the fries, so I just ended up giving them to a homeless person.

Overall, disgusting fish and fries, poor quality utensils, and horrible service. Not worth checking out and ending up smelling like fish. If only Gordon Ramsey was there to eat it..."}
{"text":"This is for those of u who think im a troll. Francis C works for the store and tried to belittle my review. The restaurant was not busy. I was the only customer there. The dessert may have not been made for a client but the chef was indeed making it with his bare hands after touching fish and sink unblocking stick (they leave hanging on the right of sink) and not washing hands with soap not once. The only reason i dont give it zero or 1 star is because i like the food but this place is pretty unclean."}
{"text":"The halibut is delicious if you can get any ... Last 3 times I've tried to order they are sold out ... Like you own a fish and chips restaurant how is that possible"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon. We each got an order of Halibut & fries ($14.99) and my friend and I split an order of Seafood  Cakes($8.99). We added on the Tartar Sauce & Garlic Mayo for $1 each. 

We got our orders pretty quickly and headed to snag a picnic table at the park. The Halibut was a generous two portions each per order, lightly breaded & tasty. The Seafood Cakes were crispy but lacked flavour, I ended up drowning them in the Garlic Mayo. Each of our orders came with a mountain of fries which we couldn't even finish. Overall the food was decent and can't beat the location for an outdoor picnic."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst fish and chips I have ever had - as some one who hails from Ireland I know my fish and chips.....!

Ordered the halibut... got a tiny piece of half battered, 3mm thick dried seriously over cooked burnt slab of brown batter  - crunch crunch - which to quote a reviewer below - looked like \"TREE BARK\" - and I think that would have tasted better..!!!! 

As for the fries - slightly better but only barely - a bit greasy and for some reason the portion was for a very small child - roughly 20-30 fries.... just about covered the bottom third of the carton.... hmmm.... for the price they charge... I think they should be gold plated...!

WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN..... save your money....!"}
{"text":"Great quality and freshly made but not cheap. Four stars for the food but it loses a star for the price point and just a general lack of trying."}
{"text":"Today i saw lax food safety standards at Chippys and alerted the chef to the issue and was shocked at their flippant reaction.

A cook in the restaurant handles raw fish and frozen fish with bare hands and then handles cooked food at the same time, not even pretending to wipe the hands or kitchen surface (and cross contaminates the whole kitchen). He then cooks the rest of the food, and serves it. 

The finished food, chips, etc are placed on the same counter as raw fish preparation. There is not an actual food service area separated from prep. There is a pool of fish juice. The chef was in the rear of the open kitchen filleting fish (during a busy service) so I stepped over to talk without having all of the customers hear the issue. 

I asked the chef telling him I've experience as a chef/food handler and am concerned, wanting to speak away from customers and told him the issue. He responded that since he is a George Brown teacher he knows the code and I don't. He questions if I really have experience as a chef, He says that the food was being prepped on one side of the counter and serve on another. I pointed out that fish juices were literally spread all over this small counter and that the other cook wasn't using gloves and that bacteria migrates.


I asked for my money back and said I didn't want to argue with him if he completely did not care about proper food handling but he just kept arguing at me angrily. My girlfriend came over and stopped things from going further. The chefs tone was very confrontational and rude.

I alerted dine safe about Chippys."}
{"text":"I was excited to have fish and chips when I drove by Chippy's but unfortunately it wasn't what I thought it would be.

I got the cod and chips and it was OK.   The fries were good but the fish batter was somewhat to hard/crunchy to bite into. The fish portions were good but that's all. The tartar sauce is homemade but it wasn't tart enough it still tasted more like mayo."}
{"text":"Location makes this a good spot for picnic take-out. There's always music on and they're friendly, but the food is just ok and the couple of times I've been in here there's been a layer of grease with flies stuck to the windows and walls. Icky. I live close by and love fish and chips, but usually make the short trek for a better option in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I came here once, and I don't think I'll come back. Fish is just \"okay\" in my books.. greasier and less flavourful than your average F&C. More expensive too. The fries were pretty good. They charge you extra for tartar sauce (who does this?? It would be like NY Fries charging extra for ketchup) - and I didn't think it was worth it. Too sour in my opinion (but keep in mind I like the sweeter kind of tartar sauce). They have cute glass Coke bottles. Nice looking storefront, but barely any room for seats - more of a take-out place."}
{"text":"With a name like Chippy's Fish and Chips, I would expect a great place for fish and chips, but was a little disappointed. The prices seemed reasonable, but the order of one small piece of battered fish and fries minus the coleslaw (extra $1) just didn't seem worth the price.  Plus tartar sauce was an extra $0.90!  I wouldn't mind if it tasted great, but it was pretty plain tasting and nothing special - almost as if it was plain mayonnaise with a sprinkling of lemon juice.

Only one staff member working during the noonish hour and thankfully the place wasn't busy.  I would hate to see the place on a busy day when the one staff member has to take orders, handle cash and cook the food.  There was a help wanted sign on the window, so could explain the short staff situation.

Staff member was welcoming and friendly upon our entrance, plus patient while we decided on our order.  Menu items were standard for a fish and chips place, so we were able to order the basics.

We ordered the haddock, cod and trout, which all appeared greasy.  The batter was a bit too greasy for my liking, but the haddock was probably the best of the three since it was fried nicely; plus the fish was flaky and tasty. The trout was probably the greasiest of them all as the grease stained the paper plate right away.  Luckily the trout was nice and flaky inside and tasted okay.  Whereas the cod wasn't flavourful at all and didn't taste fresh.  Perhaps we should have splurge extra and got the halibut instead of the cod.

Since we had three orders of fish we had plenty of fries which were cooked to a nice crisp and salted nicely.  Probably the saving grace of the fish and chips name.

Perhaps I'll go back again to try the halibut, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I usually come here if I'm hanging out at Trinity Bellwoods and am in the mood for fish and chips, and the food is a little expensive for what you get (mostly fries, small piece of fish), but it was convenient and fresh and both the cod and haddock are pretty good. Today I tried the fish cakes, though, and was super disappointed - for $9 I got two pieces of fried, bland mush. They tasted like defrosted fish sticks. Never again. Don't order the fish cakes!"}
{"text":"Not much room for eating indoors, But if the weather is good there's a great park in front.
Halibut and the fries are home made. Everything is very tasty.
  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Well...
I work close by, and on Monday I finally decided to go in for lunch.
Half of the menu was missing (and is it so hard to erase the missing items from the board?!).
The guy serving us was extremely annoying, and would not shut up for a single second, and despite the fact we stated we are not doing a takeout, the food was still stuffed into a carton boxes, followed by a statement that \"there is no other way\". Really?!
So, for $35 we got a very mediocre fish and chips...
I can name at least 20 places that do it better AND cheaper.

I suggest you take a big pass on that place. They are closed in Annex, and if they will continue the same way - Queen West location will be gone very soon as well."}
{"text":"Their portions are less than half the size that they were a couple years ago. Shocking, but not the reason for the low rating. They used to serve way more than a person could eat, so no sense wasting food. What got my goat, other than getting gouged $1 for paying debit (credit cards not accepted), was that they had a 2for1 special on haddock, we ordered a haddock and a cod, and the guy didn't mention the special. We would have been much happier with 2 haddocks and paying half as much. Can't tell the difference anyway. So, ya, I'm complaining about paying full price, but feel under-served-- service and portion. All said, it's good food."}
{"text":"I paid $20 for fish and chips here.  The service was terrible.  We waited a long time for our food.  And when we went to check on it the girl there had it ready and she had it on the table and instead of serving it to us right away, she just continued chatting with her co-worker.  The fish was so small.  And the fries were cold.  You would think if you paid $20 for a dinky piece of fish and fries that the fries would be fresh, but they weren't they were cold.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"Much like Harbord fish & chips, they have taken to the cheaper and less inspiring battering method (of seemingly just a dusting of flour) but it is still good fish and chips. That being said, you're mostly paying to eat on Queen West which is easily my least favourite reason to pay more for something. It's not expensive, but for what it is, it ought to be cheaper."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some good fish and chips. Counter eat-in and take out. Get's a little greasy when you're eating but otherwise not bad. Owner is a young guy who is very happy to chat you up. Recommend people to give it a try."}
{"text":"I paid $10 for a cod with chips that would be about 6.50 in the UK and that would be considered a 'rip-off' - the only place I have paid that much for Fish n Chips is in Padstow where the fish are caught on the day otherwise its 2 quid everyday all day.

Anyway for $10 you get a fish which taste great but is not going to fill you up and the chips I think were fresh potato cut but were thin like fries which makes them all floppy after being fried although it is a decent portion of chips..

The waiting time is what I dislike, it was close to 15 minutes and the place had only one other person waiting before me so I hate to imagine how it would be on a busy day. 

Also dislike the amount of flies buzzing around inside, the place is clean so maybe because they are right across Bellwood's park that they have so many flies inside. 

Overall as far as Fish n Chips are concerned it did not satisfy enough."}
{"text":"Totally decent British-style fish and chips. I suggest the curry dipping sauce. No bathroom though."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend afternoon, was not busy.
I had the Halibut with fries.
The batter is way too thick on the fish. I suspect the oil is not changed often as well. The fish tasted very fishy. Fish taste fishy when overcooked or not fresh. 

They charge of tartar sauce..another negative.

Fries were the only good thing about this place. 
Frankly, this place is not very good at all."}
{"text":"My visit to Chippys was long overdue. Although I must admit, I shouldn't have gone because now, it's all I want. To go into chippy's is to know that you are about to have a savoury experience. The fish is battered and cooked right infront of you by some hipsters and their dipping sauces are to die for. 

The space is quaint and really appeals to people who want to have a picnic in bellwoods (it's positioned right across the street) but dont' want the hassle of prepping it. 

If you haven't been to Chippy's, its a must in the Queen West Area."}
{"text":"Pricey and overrated. The star rating might be higher if the prices were much lower, but they're fairly steep. One order of fish and chips with a drink cost me just under $20 for lunch. The portions are good however, but the batter wasn't my favourite. Staff are always friendly and great however."}
{"text":"This place is gross.

The food is soaked in oil and the staff looks very dirty. I agree with I.M review. The place is filthy!
A good place (especially that showcases the cooking area) WOULD KEEP IT CLEAN AND HIRE STAFF THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY SHOWER.

Not here. And the owner is a PRICK."}
{"text":"super good. supposedly trendy now, but like you care. eat 'em in the park with lots of lemon."}
{"text":"Love this place. When in trinity bellwoods it's a must stop. Best fish and chips I've ever had. Fresh, and crispy you can't go wrong. The price is right plus they have a groupon deal for 15 worth thirty for the food if that's what you fancy. Great bite to grab before lounging or walking in trinity bellwoods :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Soggy halibut that didn't taste fresh and had a rubbery texture. Fries were good. Tartar sauce was decent. Coleslaw was ok nothing to write home about. Two stars only because of the fish and price. You can get better fish and chips in town for less."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to get 2 dinners for 15$. Went alone so decided to improvise and get one and just add shrimps. The fish and shrimps were delicious and piping hot. Wasn't interested in the fries much. I thought to myself that it's very overpriced. For this little take away box with food it's worth $35?? Ya, no way I'd pay full price there and if I feel like fish and shrimps again I think I'll just make it myself. If at least get double the food for the money. Overall the place is mediocre, just overpriced.  These people have to remember that it's not a fancy restaurant,  it's a fish and chips dive."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! If you're downtown and you've got a hankering for fresh, classic and unbelievably tasty seafood - you have to try Chippy's!

I was in the area and decided to stop in because the smell of the french fries were so intoxicating, and my friends and I ended up staying almost an hour and a half! It's not a huge restaurant but a cute little traditional fish n' chips joint serving everything you'd expect plus a few neat oddities. 

We tried the Haddock and Halibut which are both white fish and they were to die for...if you have a few extra dollars to spare, opt for the Halibut...perfectly flaky and melts in your mouth. 

John and Aaron of Chippy's were so friendly and knowledgeable and they recommended the Trout if we were in the mood for something a little different - I love trying out different things so I said bring it on....am I ever glad I did! I've never had fish n' chips with Trout (a lake fish, they said they get it from Lake Huron so it's very fresh) but I can't look at the regular white fish the same way again! The trout was hands down my favourite out of all three, and I'll be going back specifically for this jem. The sauces they offer are something I can't forget to mention...we had the pepper mayo, tartar sauce and garlic mayo...all incredibly tasty and put different flares in each bite.

 I really think this is a little piece of the Maritimes right here in Toronto and I'll definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place across from the park. We had the haddock and the prawn s and the batter was nice a light.  Great garlic mayo dip. Fries were pretty good the next day (too filling, could not finish in one sitting)."}
{"text":"This place is a travesty.
 First of all, it's unclean. The cooking equipment needs a good scrub and the counter by the front window is so greasy the arm of my shirt stuck to it! Oh, and there were flies all over the place.
 Secondly, the cost is excessive. They want $12 for a four ounce piece of haddock [with chips]. That's about three dainty bites. They try to make the fish look bigger by pounding it thin, but that just means it absorbs more fat from the fryer.
 Thirdly, it's just not very good. As mentioned above, the fish is greasy and it's also overwhelmed by the batter. The chips are soggy, and as they cool down they seem to coagulate into a big, mushy ball of carbs.
 There was a highlight: the pop was really, really cold...good fridge, I guess.
 I was there several years ago, just after they opened and I seem to recall the product was significantly better at the time. It's basically a tired old place, and not worth a visit, even with the coupon we used."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Chippy's... it's a favorite. 

I don't really eat fish, but the fish looks amazing. What brings me in is the french fries. The are outstanding, and really tasty. 

Chippy's is small, and until recently, they only accepted cash. Seating is limited, and the menus is fish and chips. Not much else. 

However the hipster vibe, and the outstanding food make up for the limited menu and limited seating. I give it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I remember this place used to be good but now the taste is so prosaic and substandard.  I had the halibut and the batter was thick and floury that I could hardly taste the fish, which was no wonder since the fillet they served were so small.  The chips were soggy and the homemade tartar sauce very weak.  The prices have gone up and you get less food.  So why go here?  Really!  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered the double dunk, seafood cakes, and haddock. With tartar sauce and curry sauce. 

Each of the orders came with a ton of fries. Fries were sub-par and inconsistent. In the same bath, some fries were too soggy while other fries were too crispy. 

I enjoyed the double dunk (deep fried fish between deep fried dough, with some mayo type sauce and cabbage). Seafood cakes lacked flavour, but had a nice crunch to them thanks to the breading. Haddock was mediocre. 

I thought the tartar sauce was pretty good. Curry was good but I'd rather dip something other than fried fish or chips in it. I felt like the flavours of the fish and curry sauce didn't match that well.

There's definitely better fish and chips out there. Came here on a groupon so prices turned out reasonable. Otherwise, prices here seem a bit high for the quality of food you're getting."}
{"text":"I don't get fish and chips often. This place is alright. I think a little pricey for their portion at regular price. You get a 4oz piece of fish that is pretty thin and covered with lots of batter. Each order comes with lots of fries so one order should fill you up. I really wish they have the option to add an additional piece of fish. I don't see how hard this would be...Practically every other F&C place gives you 1,2,3 piece options. 

As for quality, I'm not very picky with F&C. I mean...deep fried fish and fries would taste very similar in most places. The factors that affect quality would be the batter and seasoning. I like my food light and am glad they don't don't too much seasoning to it. You can always season it yourself with condiments. The batter is good.

The location is pretty out of the way for me so I don't have much incentive to come back. The Battered Fish is much more convenient location for me and I like their prices better so I probably won't go to Chippy's again unless I'm in the area. Battered Fish also gives you more options with the coating."}
{"text":"Great if you want to spend $14 on a bucket of fries and skinny piece of flavourless fish.

This would've been a 1-star review if the fries weren't decent."}
{"text":"I worked across the road from this place for 2.5 years and over the time must have been there about 3 times.  I give it my 3 strikes your out rating.  Each time I go there I feel like I'm bothering the staff.  They are the most unfriendly bunch of staff I've ever met.  Never say hi how are you, never turn down their music to pay some attention to me.  Once I stood there while he played on their computer changing the music.  Fries are good but over priced.  Not worth the strange service.  Also not a big fan that they don't take credit cards.  I don't care cash around much anymore so I had to run to the bank machine at 7-Eleven.  Don't work in the area any more and will never visit there again."}
{"text":"Chippy's is a fish and chip joint for hipsters. From the heavy metal/rock music blaring inside to the recylable bins inside. 

Fish and Chips here is inconsistent sometimes they get the batter just gossamer crispy (whatever that means) and the fish nicely moist inside. My last visit tonight was not so, the batter was way too hard and crunchy, and the fish was completely dried out inside. Oh and it was oversalted too. Plus you have to pay extra for tartar sauce-which I'm not even sure is homemade anymore as they claimed formerly. Chips were cut up too thick this visit but on previous visits they were not so and cooked through. Pieces of fish are a decent size. If I'm paying $10 average for a fish and chip order I'd rather be eating in pub with a beer. 

This location is located across from Trinity Bellwoods if you like enjoying your take out in the park."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Small place with just eight bar stools, not a place you can bring kids.  Basically it's just a take out spot.  Which is fine, we ordered the halibut and sat in the park across.  Fish was fried well and fries were equally as good.  Pretty pricey for take out though."}
{"text":"One word... Rip off. The fish is supposed to be 4oz serving I can promise you it isn't, because I worked in a f&c joint for years and used to fillet fish. 
Batter and fries were soggy and tasted of nothing. 
These guys survive on location alone. Overpriced and bad.
You can get better and tastier at any pub in a 10 block radius.
Avoid."}
{"text":"I love me some fish and chips. A golden battered and crispy coat, yet moist, tender, and flaky inside. Pour on the malt vinegar and a bit more salt, it just makes each bite that much better.

Chippy's does a good job of making this classic pub fare. The store is dedicated to making fried fish, so they should be wonderful. Sadly, it's not the best I've had. 

They got the coating done right. It's not too thick and not too crunchy that it leaves tiny cuts on the roof of your mouth. The fish is good. Moist and served in decent proportions.

One thing the fish lacks is flavour. It's actually quite bland. You add the salt and vinegar and it still tastes somewhat plain. The flavours don't meld well enough. The fish lacks salt and pepper. The chips are fine but tartar sauce should come free.

As a dedicated fish n chips parlor, it fails to impress. Although it's a a good portion, the price is steep and the seasoning isn't there."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I rarely get fish and chips - the batter's either too greasy or way too thick, or the fries are chunky and cold.  It's hard to do fish and chips right, and Chippy's does the recipe well.  :D

I got the haddock and chips for myself.  The fish is crispy, light and flakey.  I loved the batter - delicious and very similar with tempura!  (Light, not greasy and happy.)  The chips/fries are pretty decent - thick cut, with just the right ratio of crunchiness and softness inside.  Serving size is also on the small size - maybe more fries/chips for more value.

My only complaint is that it's expensive as hell.   $15 for haddock and chips and an ice cold ginger beer kind of detract from the experience.  (The price tag makes this a \"treat\" for an unemployed recent graduate.)  They also charge extra for the sauces - fortunately, I like ketchup and malt vinegar.  (They give you a fresh lemon slice for each order as well.)

Also, they sometimes blare loud music inside the store.  (The first time I went, I just got a large order of chips and the music was loud enough to bother me.)  I won't complain about music if it didn't sound like I was inside a nightclub and trying to order an alcoholic drink over it.  (Too bad I wasn't wearing a low cut top at the time!)

Also, seating is extremely limited and the store itself looks dingy and has no air conditioning.  This, combined with the loud, obnoxious tunes usually drives people to dine al fresco outside in Trinity Bellwoods park.

I'd try this again next week for the battered prawns/shrimp."}
{"text":"meh..
i ordered cod, one big piece of fish... i took a big bite into what looked like big piece of fish.. hoping it would be tender and juicy... to my surprise it was nothing but oily batter.. where is my fish????? only half of that piece was fish and the other half was nothing but the batter... wtf...
didn't bother going back bc was too cold but not going back anytime soon..
fries were pretty good and coleslaw made up for the half piece fish..."}
{"text":"Love the seafood cakes!  I'm bummed the location on Bloor is no longer there."}
{"text":"They do a great job at doing the basics of Fish n Chips

Cod, prawns, halibut, sturgeon (buttery flavour), Haddock

Get the curry mushy peas as a side . They are good

Crispy fried fresh fish with decent hand cut fries and a lemon wedge

No gravy? Really? I think the owner needs to rethink that offering

Nice iPad cash register....wonder if it is streaming the Arcadian music

When will they add eels to the menu will be a interesting Question only the Mods in Brighton can answer"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for lunch. Great location across from Trinity Bellwoods Park. They have cod, haddock, sturgeon, Halibut and shrimp options with chips (aka french fries) on the side. Price range is 8.50 (cod) to $13.50 halibut, including fries.

I was born in England, where fish and chips is a staple meal and been to many chip shops over the years.   Chippy's was great, but didn't live up to my expectations. A traditional fish and chips shop, the fish is thicker battered and and juicy (read oil). The fries are thicker cut and the oil is...a different flavour which has an addictive nature to it.. As well, I used to love options like pasties or chicken and mushroom pie from an original chip shop. Chippy's does not offer these options. 

The counter staff were friendly. Took about 10 min to make our meals, served fresh. Very generous serving of fries. For 4 of us, it came to $55 for lunch. Thats with 2 pops. Its a a fair amount for lunch, but seems a little overpriced for fish and chips. I think Chippys is a fun place, but...I want more bang for buck. Or more choice, more excitement in the menu. Oh and its strange they only take cash! Please invest in credit or debit services."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was after a terrible morning at work. I was sad and needed some good old-fashioned comfort food to get me through the rest of my day. I'd had a mad hankering for some greasy fish and chips so I googled it and Chippy's was the closest place. When I stepped inside, I was greeted by loud, heavy, glorious rock and roll and boys with piercings a plenty, tattoos and ill fitting clothes. 

But I didn't let their unkempt appearance fool me - they whipped up a delicious order of fish and chips that could compete with the finest pub fare in Britain.  Although their food is scrumptious, you won't be able to enjoy it in their establishment, as seating is quite limited. However, Trinity Bellwoods Park is right across the street and there are some benches outside as well.
 
If you're looking for a different (but still delicious) fish and chip experience, Chippy's is the place to go. You'll still get delicious, beer battered fish served in a cardboard container with a mound of hot and fresh French fries, but it's the unique ambiance of Chippy's that will have you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Not great. Ordered the cod and chips and walked away disappointed. The fish was paper thin and the dinner came with only 1 small piece. Chips were ok but I wouldn't go back. The batter was absolutely tasteless and I had to salt the entire meal. Just...meh. Skip it."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to grab take out as there is very minimal seating and no a/c. So like everyone else who's reviewed, we grabbed the grub and then hit up Trinity Bellwoods to enjoy the deliciousness at one of the many park picnic tables. 

I got the halibut fish and chips (not frozen and delivered that day according to the cashier) to share with my friend. The fish was delicious and was definitely fresh. The batter was crispy and crunchy and not greasy in my opinion. The chips were soooo goooooood. They were thick cut, crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside - just the way I like my fries! I also really liked the containers they came in as not many places use the Chinese takeout containers anymore. They're so useful because you can take them apart and they become plates (food hack for those who don't know). 

My only real complaint is the steep price tag and that you had to pay extra for the sauces so it really adds up. Overall I enjoyed the food but like everyone else, I've had better fish & chips for a cheaper at other places around town. If I was in the area I would get it again however I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"We were in the area and came across Chippys. Very limited seating and NO washroom makes this place more suited for take out. As such it's on the pricey side. We ordered the halibut and chips combo. Portions were good but not gut busting considering the price. The batter is different from any other place I've tried. It's way past crispy to the point of being 'crunchy'.  Personally it's not to my liking. Fish was well cooked to the point of being on the dry side. The fries however were excellent. Service was friendly. Overall establishment was average in terms of cleanliness."}
{"text":"This place is straight up disgusting. There's no other way to describe it. The entire 'restaurant' is unsanitary, with flies literally swarming the entire place, and the counter tops of the bar-height tables are sticky and filthy. The food itself was also terrible. The fries were limp and soaked in oil, and the fish was mush--not flaky--which was extremely unappetizing. And For the hefty price of $40 for two ridiculous pieces of halibut, I would have enjoyed a feast elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their batter is really tasty. Good portion. Unfortunately, one of the haddock prices was absolutely disgusting (the other two pieces wasn't properly cooked or had gone bad or something). Also, another major let down was the amount of flies in the restaurant- I was swatting flies and other tiny insects away throughout the meal. Sad thing is that I'll probably return lol maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"Went to Chippy's Fish and Chips on August 5,2010 and planned to order
the expensive item on the list -Halibut fish and chips.
The two dudes who works there totally ignored me. I was only behind 4 to 5 people who was waiting for their orders. I was now at the front waiting to be served. My first impression is that they do not served colour
people as most of their customers are whites.
I left after waiting for 15 minutes and vowed that I will never return.
The two dudes noticed me, but choose to ignored me."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Fish and Chips, but when I get the craving I'm all in.. Chippy's halibut friedX2 is the way to go.. no thats not what its called - but it's super fried - SO don't plan on ordering the Diet Coke with it, because it won't help. 

Healthy heap of fries.. yummy dipping sauces. 

Sure I'll go back.. after I work out a ton so I don't feel guilty. :)"}
{"text":"i cant say i was all that interested in having fish and chips before chippys came around and i think that might be the case for a few folks out there, so congratulations to them for that.  it also seems that they had some kind of hand in introducing different kinds of fish into the whole mix and other notables such as scallops and so on.  so again, nice work.

what has made the effect of those things diminish for me is their overbreading of the fish and its subsequent greasiness.  ive always felt a little queasy after having eaten here.  the fries are great, the accompanying sauces tasty, the choices varied but this important aspect wanting. 

and yes, as preposterous as it sounds, this location loves the kill, kill, kill, devil, devil, devil music.  its offensive how loud they play it and stupid.  im surprised the owner hasnt said anything."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. We've been living in Toronto for two months and have been searching for an English style fish and chip shop since arriving. So far we've had no luck at all, not even close.

\"Traditional\" British chips from a chippy are meant to be thick cut, skinless, borderline soggy, soft and best served in paper, with loads of salt and vinegar. And they're amazing, despite sounding kind of gross.

All the chips here seem to be skin-on, thin (like French fries), and crispy, usually overcooked. 

So anyway, we popped in here today after hearing it's meant to be \"pretty close to real English fish and chips\".. sorry to all who've told me that, you're completely wrong, it's nowhere near similar. Like, at all. 

The cod was $11 and the fillet was very thin- it didn't have a lot of flavour, and the batter was both too crispy and also mostly chewy. Undercooked and very pale too :/ 
The chips weren't exactly bad, they were just overdone and a lot of them were just the nubby dregs. 

Hate to say it but my boyfriend said it was the \"shittiest fish and chips\" he's ever had and left his whole portion of chips, and I also had about 10 before I left them behind.

The search continues... but I'm close to giving up."}
{"text":"I have been anti fish & chips  for the longest time since my experience at the Fish house or something way back when I was still young. It jaded me and I've never tried it since. Until my friend more or less made me because he was buying food as I was more broke then a poorman's dish, and this was my only choice. I was never so glad to be forced to try something I didn't like -and I must thank my friend for getting me back on the road to trying new and different foods.

I don't think there is very much to complains except the portion is so huge that I always want to die after eating it , always have a dilemma while eating the food (should i get sick finishing the food or, throw it out).

The batter is  always most perfect - the fish comes out thick ,crispy yet greasey on the outside ,  soft, tender and meaty inside. The fries are awesome - I am not a fries kinda gal, but I will not pass on these.  The coleslaw and the sauce - all delicious. My favourite part about this chain is that ,every Chippy's I've gone to has been have been GREAT.

Big enough portion to share with a friend or buy yourself. It almost makes the incredible wait time worth it...almost...not quite."}
{"text":"One of the best surprises that I ever got when I was walking around the neighbourhood was turning the corner close to Trinity-Bellwoods park (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/trinity-bellwoods-park-toronto) and I came across Chippy's.  I'd just gotten back from a trip to the UK and had chippies on the mind, bemoaning the fact to my friends that there's no decent fish and chips to be had this side of the Atlantic.  Tales of being able to select the type of fish you wanted, fries made from actual potatoes, and the prospect of mushy peas made me rue and drool all at the same time.

Enter Chippy's.  A small take-away shop with maybe a half-dozen stools for \"dining in\", the main traffic Chippy's gets is from the strollers in the park, or those heading home looking for dinner to be grabbed on the way.  Once you enter Chippy's, you're faced with the menu board of fish options.  Yup.  You get to pick the fish.  Halibut.  Cod.  Haddock.  Salmon (seriously?).  The spuds are cut daily, and fried up for you.  No fake taters here.  Since they've got the deep-fryers going anyway, they also serve up a mean funnel cake.  Me, I'm more about the fish.

Oh, and grab the mushy peas.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Pros were service was fast, staff were very nice. Cons, the food smelled great but wasn't up to the task. There isn't any seasoning in the batter, it just tasted like flour and oil, the fries were pretty soggy, also unseasoned. For the price (20$ for haddock and fries) definitely not worth it unfortunately. I hate to say it because I had high hopes. 
Other downside is that there are only 4 seats in the small storefront so don't expect to sit down for the meal."}
{"text":"This was my second trip here, and the first experience was better. Good fish and chips, but a lot of burned end fries and they charge $0.95 for tarter sauce. That's ridiculous, and bordering on fish and chip blasphemy.

Would still go again, but with tempered expectations"}
{"text":"Chippy's is so-so. I landed here on a hunt for food to eat in the park. Not the best I've had, but it wasn't offensive or anything.

The good:
- not overly battered (read: greasy) fish
- good location for summertime eats
- service was relatively fast considering only one person was working

The bad:
- the fish to fry ratio is off. if there were two pieces of fish, this meal could easily be split for lunch
- some of my fries were cold in the middle

The ugly:
- extra charge for tartar sauce!!!!! wtf, that's half the reason i get fish and chips."}
{"text":"Best fish in town! The staff is absolutely amazing! It's great knowing just down the street from CBD centre there is something worth eating daily!"}
{"text":"Cute spot for spring/summer especially, when you can grab yourself some F&C and chow down across the street at Trinity-Bellwoods. The haddock was nicely battered and crispy, although it was a bit too oily for my liking, and I had quite a struggle cutting the fish with the flimsy plastic cutlery. The fries are nothing to write home about. I've definitely had better fish and chips, for the same price or cheaper.

The saving grace of this place are the staff. Whether you choose to grab one of the limited seats inside or grab your order to go, you'll enjoy the time you spend there. Cash only!"}
{"text":":(

My expectations were high, based on all of the wonderful reviews I've read. The staff was nice, the 'cash-only' was only a minor inconvenience, the prices were good, but the food not so much. The fish batter was very greasy and the fries were soggy. The whole group I came with was sick all night after we ate here. Perhaps a bad batch? I'm really not sure, but I don't yet have the courage to re-try."}
{"text":"I want to say 2.5. And am tempted to say a 3, but I know I wouldn't go back there and pay full price as I used a groupon. The One That Got Away near King and Portland has much better Fish N Chips though. The fries there are quite a bit better, and so is the fish. Also the haddock there is cheaper (8.99). I also really enjoy the brick wall atmosphere there.

When I went to Chippy's we ordered ahead, but there was a big back log and I believe they are under staffed. They had two people working there, which left no one manning the cash when both had to cook. So as I stood there in line waiting for them to take everyone's order and pay, my food was sitting on the counter the entire time getting even colder. If you are getting takeout you should probably just go and order there.  Or I recommend going on off hours, like midday."}
{"text":"A 3 star for the fish n chips, the absence of proper dishes to cut the fish (just plastic fork and knife) and the price that is expensive (15 CAD for fish, chips, soft
drink) for what the place looks like and deliver brings it down to a 2 star."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips. Pricey if you go for the halibut (which is a must try) but the rest of the menu is decent for the price. Eat it across the street at the park. And if you have time for A nap after that doesn't hurt - serious itus inducing stuff."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars 
I also think the Annex location is closed down? 

VIBE 
it's pretty busy in here but I like that and in the summer, this is a perfect picnic in the park across the street. 

I EAT
Halibut and chips. Yum to the yum. Great batter; not too overpowering or thick so you really taste the fish and the tartar sauce is fantastic! I always ask for extra on it. The chips are thick and chewy but there are way too many of them. More fish, less chips! The coleslaw is pretty tasty too. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Just because your name is Chippy's it doesn't mean you have to have an overflowing amount of chips. But they're good! Nom."}
{"text":"Was there a couple weeks ago for the first time.  My friend and I received a couple pieces of fish that resembled tree bark.  Super thin cut of fish, battered and deep fried until it was WAY overcooked.
The end result made it hard to differentiate between the 'barely there' fish, and rock hard batter.  Again I say....Tree Bark!

Giving this place two stars because the fries were good.  But otherwise I wouldn't bother.  

Also of note, you pay extra for tartar sauce which is lame, and there is no \"traditional\" gravy on the menu (for my fries).  Safe to say we won't be going back.

Oh, and one more thing... may be an issue for some, but it's cash only here!"}
{"text":"I love fish and chips. Next to Tex-Mex, chicken fried steak, and a good T-bone, it's probably my favorite food!  The fish and chips here do not disappoint! I also enjoy getting an order to go, and strolling the area, maybe plopping down in the nearby park somewhere and having a sit, people watching and finishing my fried goodness. I love Chippy's!"}
{"text":"tried there fish and chips and there were bland, bland, bland. Even the tartar sauce could not add any flavor. I am not sure they even any type of seasoning to the fish or batter. At 10$ a portion I expected much,much more...I say pass and eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"******Yelp Correction*******  It lists with their info that they accept credit cards and that is flase, they are strictly cash only. 
 That little detail really factored into my low rating.  I dont get how business owners are going to inconvenience customers by making them pay at an atm to get out money or walk to their bank just so they dont have to pay the service charge.  Also our first impression was the cook outside infront of the building, smoking as we entered.  So after we ordered 2 cod and chips portions and the total came to $18.06.  Now being in retail i always give people an extra penny, this guy would not take $18.05.  so i know none of this has to do with food, so lets get to it.  I love cod, even though its the cheapest i always find it delcious.  This had no taste.  The only reason i gave Chippy's 2 stars was bc their chips were so good."}
{"text":"Not bad! Not bad at all. Tried the halibut and it was pretty good. Fries were salted to perfection. Tartar sauce was decent, coleslaw was not the greatest and the service was fast. $15 for the fish and chips. I couldn't finish it, there was a huge portion of fries in the takeout container. Be prepared to be hungry!

Open Sundays until 9. Not really a sit down place - got some window seats so you can people watch as you eat though. 

If you see it on Groupon, buy it! However halibut doesn't include in the Groupon."}
{"text":"Perched on one of the few stools that faced Trinity Bellwoods on a spectacularly beautiful day with a huge platter of haddock and chips before me, I felt that life didn't get much better than that. The only thing that I could possibly complain about was how hot my meal was. Having come fresh out of the fryer, the gigantic boite of fries and one and two halves of fish fillets were piping hot.

The batter on the fish had the light flavouring of tempura, but stayed held together as once piece like a crispy fillet bodysuit. I was most delighted with the simplicity of the seasoning. Nothing more than a healthy sprinkle of salt was needed to naturally enhance the flavour and quality of the fish.

I wasn't too impressed with the tartar sauce though. It was more like mayo with some green flakes in it. In fact, I suspect that it was not actually tartar sauce at all, but garlic mayo that was mistakenly served to me. Also, I find Cash Only to be quite the inconvenience. The dude behind the counter didn't seem to mind tossing my order into the fryer while I went down the street to use the ATM though. Warning: If you are not with CIBC, be prepared with cash or be prepared to slap an extra $1.50 onto your meal total. Lastly, they didn't sell any non-carbonated beverages other than water. Where's the iced tea?

Judging from the limited number of seats (which is not conducive for dining in) and proximity to both 7-11 (which has a much wider selection of beverages) and Trinity Bellwoods (can you say al fresco?), I think that the solution is clear: 

Take away, take away, take away!"}
{"text":"Nice and convenient location for a picnic at the park. We ordered the cod and it had no flavour - chips were a bit soggy/over cooked. Not the best but fine as a quick picnic meal."}
{"text":"Chippy's is getting all my Fish and Chips related business from now until I find something better. If I never find something better, I would still be happy I have Chippy's. 
I went here one evening with my sister to grab some sustenance. Place is small and dead simple which immediately made me smile. I ordered the Haddock and my sister had the fish cakes. Service was a little slow but the portions were large. 
 It's really hard to screw up deep fried fish with a side of fries. Most places with bad Fish and Chips usually stray from tradition which causes mixed results for the final product. Gladly they keep it simple here and my Haddock was great.  My sister's fish cakes were a little undercooked but the pretty lady frying all the good stuff had no problem taking it back and upgrading her to the Halibut for no extra charge. 
Chippy's is great. Cheap, fresh and filling. I can see myself coming here very often."}
{"text":"It's called Hooky's now... Well, atleast thats whats shown on the storefront window. Very basic menu, but still pretty tasty. Tried the calamari and it was nice and crispy, didnt taste old, wasnt too chewy. Pretty good with the choice of dipping sauces you get. Friend also tried the cod and it was nicely battered. There were a few items on the menu that they ran out of (fish cakes, onion rings, etc.) But overall a good place to get fried seafood."}
{"text":"Excellent location ! 
Superb customer service 
food was amazing we had shrimp , the halibut may have had a tad too much batter -but overall delicious meal ."}
{"text":"i love chippy's. every time im in toronto its the first place i take my friends to eat. authentic english fish and chips. the food is always fresh and piping hot and the staff is awesome. the restaurant is very affordable as well. u definitely get bang for your buck. ive often found myself hanging out a bit even after dining. its also on a stretch of queen street where theres not so much hustle and bustle so its usually easy to park and its never really crowded. id recommend anyone to this place without hesitation."}
{"text":"If I hadn't told you already, my last meal on Earth might arguably be fish and chips. But Chippy's fish probably won't make it to my dinner table. I read about them in one of the reviews and I decided to give it a try since I was in the Queen Street West area. However, I felt the fish and chips missed a few points. The chips was quite greasy and over fried. I also thought that the piece of fish was on the small side even though the batter tasted quite OK. Chippy's gets a three star from me for now but I hope the chips will be better the next time I come visit."}
{"text":"Went to Chippys this past Sunday to redeem a Groupon that I had gotten. Didn't happen to notice that the Groupon couldn't be redeemed for Halibut...oh well. Anyways, got Haddock instead. The fish was great and crispy, and the fries were awesome too. However, while we were finishing up eating, one of the two guys working there was cutting lemons with a yellow handled knife and dropped the knife on the ground, then picked it up and continued cutting.He also cut his finger slightly and put on a regular flimsy bandaid without washing his hands. Im preeetttttyyyy sure this is unsanitary, and I was kind of instantly grossed out. There were other customers in the restaurant getting take out orders etc so I didn't really wanna make a scene and bring it up, so I went to their website to send them an email about it..which bounced back because the address isn't valid anymore.

All in all.. had I NOT seen that stuff, I would have rated higher"}
{"text":"Not impressed. First off, for the price I was expecting something pretty damn good. What I received was a half portion of halibut (the guy basically said 'too bad'), and fries - which are NOT chips. Hear me? NOT CHIPS. You should be called \"Fries' Half Fish & Fries\". Like other people are saying, you'll get a much better fish & chips in your local pub. Avoid."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that I didn't go inside, so I can't speak to the cleanliness of the place, but I have no idea why Chippy's place gets so many negative reviews. Quite possibly the best Fish & Chips I've had in Toronto, and definitely the best tartar sauce! In fact, we had several of the sauces, and they were all terrific! Four of us shared a Double Dunk sandwich, which was decadent, to say the least, but also amazingly tasty!"}
