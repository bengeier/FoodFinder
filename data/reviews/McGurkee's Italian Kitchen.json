{"text":"I love stopping by and getting a turkey sub. It might sound plain but I promise you it is the tastiest sandwich I've ever had . The sesame seeded bun is what does it for me. Not to mention the pasta, I ordered the buttered noodles with chicken and it is comfort in a bowl. I have yet to try the pizza. I can go for McGurkee's anytime"}
{"text":"McGurkee's is hands down the best sandwich shop in Arizona. This is a family run business which has really hit the nail on the head. Their toasted bread is marvelous.  Try the Super Silician, Tuna, Pastrami and the JP Turkey to begin with but you can't go wrong with any of the choices. I eat there with one of my family members at least once a week. If it were located in my work territory I would eat there everyday.  Check out the Ham & Cheese- I think I am becoming addicted to this sandwich!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and go here at least twice a week! I get the Super Sicilian every time. Seriously the best sub i've ever had. The bread is fantastic! Friendly owner, nice vibe, great food...not much more to ask for!"}
{"text":"This place is been around since my father was a teenager. It's truly a family favorite. It always delivers fresh custom-made sandwiches. And the atmospheres a gray. The vibes from the employees is always upbeat, happy and ready to make a great sandwich!!! Family favorite three generations long"}
{"text":"I love the feel of this place. Very cool vibe. It's truly a hidden gem. If you don't know about it, you'd drive right by. It faces 15th Ave and parking is in the back. Just be prepared to drive around the block to find it and you won't be sorry you did. It's worth it!   Let's talk meat. Nice thick slices of meat. They don't skimp round here, y'all and me likee. My fiance and I shared the Super Sicilian and it was enough for both of us plus a side of potato salad, chips, and a green salad. The potato salad is good- nothing fancy just simple yummy goodness. The toasted sesame seed buns are heavenly.The simple salad is a little skimpy for the price tag, it could use some darker leafy goodness or some jazz. But I don't mess around with the salad. I want thick delicious meat and potatoes. That's right. I wear the pants.   Bonus points for serving beer here. Double bonus for serving Moretti instead of Peroni."}
{"text":"They have the very best subs in the valley!  I never like pepercinis until I had their subs.  It's a family owned business and always consistent. The only thing I would ask is that they BRing Back the BAKED LAYS to go with my sub."}
{"text":"What is the big deal with this place? It was one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had. Number 1 the bread was so burnt it was not edible . The roast beef was rubbery and old. The bread had so many sesame seeds on it that's all you tasted was burnt sesame  bread . The dip was cold. 11 bucks for a Nasty sandwich and potato salad and a drink. Not worth it. I will never visit again. The place looks old and dirty and smells like burnt bread. Your better off with a cold cut from circle K."}
{"text":"Super Sicilian is probably the best sandwich I ever had .. Hands down this place is great.."}
{"text":"I don't take the time to write a lot of reviews but I really feel like this place deserves one.  This family owned business is top notch and deserves recognition for the quality of the food they serve.  I'm going to keep it real, I've been coming here for over 10 years and I've ONLY ordered the Super Sicilian for those 10 years.  I feel like if I order anything else I would feel guilty like I'm cheating on the Super Sicilian.  A great sandwich starts with the bread and ENDS with the bread, PERIOD.  The sesame bread is \"THE TRUTH\".. not kidding.. the bread is freakin awesome.  I bet you could put a piece of dog poop in that bread and the sandwich would still be very good.  The bread has the proper sesame to bread ratio and is put in the oven for the perfect amount of time to make sure it has just the right amount of toastiness.  Then you get to the ever important meat to bread ratio which is also very important.  No one wants to take a bite and taste more bread then the ingredients inside the sandwich.  The ratio is also perfect.  The sandwich is meaty and you are guaranteed that in every bite you are tasting all the flavors of the sandwich.  Toasty, meaty, moist, flavor (That's what she said.. I know some of you are thinking it) makes this sandwich the best in the valley.  You know what they say, once you go Super you'll never go....."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a round of golf for a quick bite. This place has some neat history with the city of Phoenix. They have some great food items. I order an Italian style grinder and it was great. I will for sure stop there after every round of golf in the future."}
{"text":"Been going here for over a decade. The food is delicious! Love the owners; hardworking, sweet people. Def recommend 'the Gurks'!"}
{"text":"Really really good Italian Sandwiches. Make sure you have a few extra minutes, they really care about consistency."}
{"text":"This place is so good! The sicilian sandwiches are amazing. The sesame bread is great. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"No disappointment as always. Reminds me of best home food. I feel like I'm home with family"}
{"text":"This is the best hidden treasure in Phoenix. Located on 15th ave and Thomas, it is an unpretentious little place. But... The sandwiches are to die for! You must try it, delicious! You will be coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Delish! My dad and I needed a quick place to grab lunch on our way from Phoenix to Sedona. We wasted so much time trying to google places and use maps, so glad Yelp had this place listed. This was a hole in the wall local gem! We both had the Super Sicilian, and it was awesome!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years.  Little Mom and Pop shop.  Great sandwiches, especially the Super Sicilian.  Can get noisy during lunch hours.  Very good food, would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I had the super sicilian, bread was excellent and so was the toppings. I love that they have a little patio out back. Overall atmosphere was very charming. I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not THAT good. I could make these sandwiches, and I've had better. It is good though, just don't order the chicken caesar salad. I'm not sure if it was because we got it Togo or what, but never will I ever be paying $7.90 for that half a**ed salad again. Friendly staff and the meatball sub."}
{"text":"I was traveling and desperately needed some lunch. Stopped here and was very pleased. Great flavorable sandwich and friendly service. I liked that there were tons of choices, fresh bread, toppings galore."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches on amazing home made rolls. Be carefull, very additive. Great prices, been there for almost 50 years. Try it and it will be your fav. Can't compare this quality and taste to all those lousy chain sandwich stores."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been in this place, and I figured it was time for a good sammie. I've had a few of their sandwiches in the past, but today I got the Athenian chicken sandwich. The sautéed onions and feta cheese adds a nice flavor to it. I would recommend this place if you are in the area or for someone who wants to venture out from their usual sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Place sucks.  I am from Chicago and I know a thing or two about great sandwich's. This place however, does not!!  They can't even make a simple French dip here.  The meat was dry and bland they had the attention span of a fly and the place was empty. I should have known. But it is a local business and I wanted to do my part.  My part has been done and I will not eat here ever again. The food is worse then subway. I mean I wanted a great sandwich but what I got was a lack luster sandwich made with bitterness and shame rather then love. And you can tell with one bite. Do yourself a favor get a sandwich down the street at sack's better food better bread and better quality meats for sure and service with a smile. Trust me on this this place is an epic failure.  Sorry but jp is bs."}
{"text":"Best Italian sandwich I have ever had. The perfectly toasted bread and flavorful meats make this the perfect spot to have a sandwich. Highly recommend the Super Sicilian. Also, it's a family run shop which always gives me a good feeling because they really care about service and putting out great food."}
{"text":"Warm Super Sicillian on the sesame seed bread and cold Sam Adams * BLAMO *PURE BLISS*"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I got the Super Sicilian.   The bread was great, toasted sesame roll. Meat was bland. Cheese tasted processed so I assume it was. I found this to be an average sandwich. I prefer Sacks down the street.   I will probably go back and try the meatball sub. Parking is minimal. Great decor."}
{"text":"Simply sandwiches, they may have other stuff on the menu but I would never know because I can't get past the super Sicilian & the turkey. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I have never had a lunch that cried out for something more...Just anything, italian dressing, mayo, mustard...It was just bland.    Tried a Super Sicilian, that came out more tasting like a warm bologna sandwich, and cold cuts barely covered about 1/2 of the already narrow bun.  The bun was also completely covered with sesame seeds, which just overpowered anything that actually got into the sandwich.  My guest tried another sandwich had similar complaints..."}
{"text":"I went with a friend today and at first I'm thinking, \"wait, pizza and subs??\" The meatball sub is BEYOND words and by the looks of the reviews it is a must to try! Also, their Hawaiian pizza was awesome! I love seeing that kind of pizza with big chunks of pineapple and ham on it! Really great food!"}
{"text":"What a waste of time,  gas & money going back here,  was looking forward to going back after my first visit but the bread was burned on the sandwich and it was cold like it hadn't even been toasted,  not sure I'll be headed back"}
{"text":"What a discovery. True neighborhood gem.  Don't get fool by the location or the looks of the place (it looks that it has have better days), the food is really good and the prices are decent.  I has the Greek salad, the great Italian sub and the Hawaiian pizza. Everything was great although I wouldn't go for the pizza. Don't take me wrong, it's good but the rest of the food is better.  Don't forget to check the vintage refrigerator out!  Cheers"}
{"text":"sandwich was amazing. The sicilian sandwich was higley recomended by co-workers and didn't dissapoint one bit"}
{"text":"I ordered two chicken Mediterranean sandwiches to go. Made with roasted chicken breast, feta cheese, lettuce. Service was great, food was yummy. The sesame bread was terrific! My only complaint was it took them close to half an hour to make the food. It did not seem to be that busy when I placed my lunch order.  Would love to go back."}
{"text":"Finally in place of fantastic bread meteor average Deli but it's all about that crusty seeded Italian bread you must eat it there though because with all the dressing and condiments it gets soggy fast it's a mom dad son ran place so they always take care of you anytime I'm in the area definitely going to come here forget about Subway"}
{"text":"If you have time for lunch, the sandwich was excellent. We got there at 11:30, and our to go took almost 30 minutes. I got the Turkey, and the toasted sesame seed bun was awesome! I tried their potato salad, but didn't really care for it as it was pretty sweet. If they take ahead orders, then that is the way to go."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that 3 great places to eat inhabit the intersection of 15th avenue and McDowell, but along with The Original Hamburger works and Persian Garden, this place is really good.   They serve sandwiches mostly and they are very good. The Bread and the Meat taste fresh and you get the feeling these guys are have been doing this along time.  the restaurant itself is small but not uncomfortable. Vintage newspaper and political advertising adorn the walls. This and the abundance of wood trim give the place an aged atmosphere in the best kind of way.   I would gripe that you have to go to the back of the restaurant to order from the counter. There's no signs indicating that, so don't just sit down and wait for service."}
{"text":"stopped in for a few pizzas with the fam. Pretty good pizza, nice local little spot. we had this pizza with meatballs and pepperoni and a margherita. Both were pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich. solid 3 stars"}
{"text":"McGurkees is an all-time favorite. My family has been frequenting this great sandwich shop for over 20 years! Love the subs! Love the staff!"}
{"text":"Yum yum such good sandwiches this place is full of fun decor and totally worth a stop in at. Try the supreme Sicilian with their out of this world potato salad you will not be disappointed. Plus if you love antiques they have hands down the coolest antique beer cooler I've ever seen up and running."}
{"text":"Super Sicilian was a solid sub.   I would mainly come back here to support the sweet couple running the establishment. The décor was cute and reminded me of Cheers. I hope this great local spot continues to do well!"}
{"text":"Hubby used to live in Phoenix ages ago, so when we had the chance to come back for a graduation ceremony (Go Steph!), we HAD to stop at McGurkee's.  We ordered the Super Sicilian to eat at the airport before going home.  Although it was a tad soggy, it was awesome!  The meat and cheese were so good - high quality for sure.  The bread was nice and toasty.  I really wish we had stayed and eaten there.  It had a cool, laid back vibe.  Oh well, next time...Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in metro Phoenix! Service is friendly and fast.   Make sure you add potato salad to your order, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't get more Yelp love. It's a solid sandwich place right next to the Phoenix College campus and Encanto Park. I used to love getting a great toasted sub here (way better than Subway and the other sub shops in town) and walking over to the little lake to watch ducks in the afternoon. Nice people, cute little space with bug wooden booths. Vegetarian? They've got a good veggie sammy for you too. Short hours though. Keep the order simple and you can't go wrong. Oh, and to Vincent H-- the supposed Chicago-French Dip expert? The French dip was invented in Los Angeles.In your book, doesn't that make my sandwich opinion more valuable than yours?"}
{"text":"3.8 stars, got the Italian Hero Sub.   Portion size 4.3  Proportion of meat to bread 3.5 (2 slices of meat is not enough, sub roll was good though) Ambiance 4.1 (inside was cool, patio was cool, parking terrible) Price 3.5 ($7.50 for that sandwich is too high)"}
{"text":"Best subs in town...worst parking in Phoenix!!  This is a great place for a sub...a regular throwback with great tasting food. If you have not tried it you should, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Friggin epic sandwiches.  Pretty busy - parking is a pain.  The sandwiches are AMAZING though.  Don't be in a hurry here - takes a good 10-15 minutes to get your order.  I don't care - it rules."}
{"text":"Had the Big Sicilian - Great sandwich! Yes parking is bad, and this place is cramped during lunch, but you can call head and take it to go.  I ate on the back patio where it was nice and shaded.   The sandwich was the perfect mix of meat and cheese to bread ratio. Everything was really fresh and the potato salad was really good also.  Worth a stop and I look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"I  LOVE JP McGurkee's!!  I've been going there since I went to West High in the early 1970's.  We'd get a sandwich and go to Encanto Park.  Now my teenage son loves the place too - a bbq chicken sandwich fan.  We always stop there when we are in the neighborhood.  The owners are very friendly and will accommodate you any way they can.  If I could give it more than a 5 star rating I would.  You owe it to yourself to try this place - YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place, so I tied it. It was just ok. I've had better and worse. I had an Italian sub with chips and a drink. Nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit."}
{"text":"Awesome subs!  This place has been around forever and with good reason.  I stopped here with the fam before heading down to the fair.  It was a great decision and the whole the family loved the food.  We tried the super sicilian, the turkey, and a hot dog for my son.  The Super Sicilian is their number one seller and amazing.  All the subs come on this toasted sesame seed bun that really makes them.  So good fresh and tasty.  My son said it was the best hot dog he's ever had.  The service was also excellent.  The guy upfront was friendly and helpful.  The only knock on this place is the parking.  It is very limited and tight.  Cars were circling round and round while we ate.    Other than that the experience was top notch and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered 25 sandwiches for our faculty lunch on Tuesday. They were fresh, hearty, and well worth the price.  The sandwiches had all the fixings, and we're ready hot and on time. I totally support this family business because when I called, a very nice person took the order, confirmed it and that was greatly appreciated. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for luch for the last 25 years. The Super Sicilian is the best sub in town - bar none. Parking is a challenge but worth the hassle. People are friendly and the ingredients are of the highest quality. Read the posters while you are there. The newpaper from D-Day is a great piece of history."}
{"text":"In regards to the food, the Super Sicilian is quite delicious. There was plenty of meat and cheese which were accompanied with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, dill pickle spear, and a light oil and vinegar dressing. Both my husband and I enjoyed the sandwich greatly! I ordered take out and understanding that I arrived around 3:30, after the lunch hour rush, I was a little disappointed in the overall cleanliness and atmosphere. The floors were dirty, there was trash in the plant, and the table cloths were worn out."}
{"text":"Wow, the sandwiches are so good! I had the Hero and didn't know what to expect so I was a bit shocked to see sesame seeds on the bread. I didn't think I'd care for them but one bite in and I was in heaven. They toast the subs perfectly and while the sandwiches are huge I had no problem finishing mine because it was too delicious to not eat every last bite."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the very best sandwich places to hit up for lunch in downtown Phoenix! If you havent tried this place you have got to give yourself some time and come on down!   There was a group of us the other day for lunch. A few of us had the Super Sicilian, including myself. The bread is just just barely toasted, light and easy to eat with bubbling melted cheese a top of bed of lettuce and tomatos and a light italian dressing. Each sandwich is made with high quality ingrediants. The meats are just incredible with strong flavours and compliment each other very well and the result is excellent!    The only disappointment here was that some got a half sandwich instead of a full! 4$ for a half, and 7$ for a full, you just cant beat the flavours and quality for that price!"}
{"text":"An Italian sub shop with an Irish name, you gotta like that.  The subs are very tasty as well as affordable and the service is fast and friendly.  The location  is a bit odd and the parking lot might eat your car but the dining area is unique and pleasant.  I have been a few times and will continue frequenting when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Come, you won't be disappointed. I recommend the Athenian chicken sandwich. Never tasted anything like it!"}
{"text":"Over priced dried out sandwiches in a cramped spot with crappy parking.   Go to Angie and Jimmys on Camelback."}
{"text":"How have I lived in this town for over 20 years now - many of those years in the central Phoenix area - and *not* ever heard of this place? My companion, the Fantastic Mr. \"It's Complicated\", was shocked I'd never heard of it, and brought me in for lunch yesterday.  He was so right! It is a gem of a sammy shop!  I ordered the Sicilian sub - great balance of flavor and texture, and everything was super fresh. Fantastic Mr. \"It's Complicated\" went for the Super Sicilian - basically the same, but with the addition of ham. The toasted sesame bread was amazing - I will have to see if they will just sell loaves of that. The meats were all good and the veggies were fresh. The dressing was tasty and perfect amount.   Could not have been happier with the food.  The place is old and small and just the way I like my neighborhood places to be. More money is spent on food than updating decor - and I appreciate that. It's clean, but small. I can see how the lunch rush could be quite chaotic in here - luckily I wasn't there until about 2:30 - it was pretty close to empty.   The other reviews about the parking lot were right - if it were lunch rush, it would be insane!  Granted - it's technically possible my five star review is influenced by the new man, everything in the world seems just a little better when I am with him, so I will have to go back when the happy cloud wears off or maybe even without him. You know, in the name of scientific research.  But I have a feeling these will still be great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients, reasonable prices round out what is otherwise a relatively simple menu in a simple establishment.  The emphasis here is and always has been on the sandwiches.  My brother has raved about McGurkee's sandwiches for most of his life.  Not everything about McGurkee's and their location are perfect.  But for a quick, tasty, unassuming meal, you'll likely walk away a pretty happy customer as I did.  As other Yelpers have accurately described, perhaps the most difficult thing about this place is access.  The restaurant is located on the backside of a business building on the southwest corner of 15th Ave and Thomas.  The business itself faces 15th Ave, but you could easily pass by without seeing it.  Parking in this business complex is virtually non existent so my advice is don't even bother.  Instead park across the street either at Mu Shu's parking lot on the northwest corner or behind the Encanto Village complex on the southeast corner and just walk over.  If you're a Phoenix College student you're fortunate enough to be within a block of this place and I'd assume a sizable portion of their business comes from hungry PC kids.  I came here on a Wednesday just before 5pm to a relatively quiet restaurant, though business picked up after I arrived.  The interior is hard to describe.  It almost feels like a small cabin with all the wood trim everywhere.  And yet the checkerboard table cloths remind you this is a restaurant with an Italian tilt.  It is on the divvy side, though I've certainly seen divvyer.  Oh, by the way, don't be fooled by the sign outside.  There's no pizza served here (not exactly truth in advertising, I know), just sandwiches and salads.  There's beer and wine behind the counter along with the prep area.  No waiter service as its order at the counter and they call your name when its ready.  As today was my first time, I got the sub that Yelpers seem to rave about more than any other.  A footlong Super Sicilian.  The specs on this thing:  two types of salami, two types of ham, cappicolla, swiss cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato, and italian dressing all on a toasted sesame sub roll.  Also comes with whole peppers on the side if you wanna add those.  Total cost including water and tax was $9.  Came out in a little over 5 minutes.  Admittedly I wasn't able to get a decent camera shot of this thing because it was so messy, but this was a very tasty sandwich.  The different meats are piled on and give the sandwich a great flavor profile.  The contrasts are mostly between the mild and spicy kind as some of the meats (particularly the spiced ham and cotto salami) have a nice kick to them.  Kinda wish they had silver or plastic ware available as some of the sandwich fell apart into my basket.  Seeing no forks or spoons anywhere, I scooped the remaining pieces out with my fingers (after checking to make sure no one was looking).  Hey I didn't wanna leave any good stuff behind, okay?  When all was said and done, I was in and out in about 20 minutes.  If it was easier to get in and out of the complex, I'd imagine McGurkee's would get a lot more business than they already do, though to be fair it seems like they do well enough as it is.  Would certainly recommend this place for lunch (provided you're tolerant about the whole parking issue) or for a quick mid afternoon meal.  It ain't fancy or modern, but in the case of McGurkee's, that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Sandwich Heaven! Believe the hype. This place is fantastic. Gets packed at Lunch, but worth the wait. I always get the Super Sicilian. Y U M M Y!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  4 stars for the food but 0 stars for service. The food service industry is two fold , good food and good service, unfortunately this place is failing miserably as far as service is concerned. If your on a time crunch for lunch forget about this place. Parking is ridiculous and non existent, the food takes an average of 40 plus minutes to come out, even if you call ahead, even the simple sandwiches. The layout of the restaurant at lunch time makes it a sardines packed free for all in an attempt to even find somewhere to stand much less sit. I will however note that I have only been here for lunch as I work nearby so dinner could be a different scenario, except parking."}
{"text":"I live right by this place and was never sure if it was open or closed BUT don't let that deter you from going in.  There is a big tree right in front that makes it a little secluded covering the front door and sign, but I finally walked over the other day and now I can't get enough!  It is clean inside and has an older feel due to the  oak wood refrigerators behind the counter.  I had the Sicilian sub.... the bread was perfectly crunchy toasted to perfection.  I'm not sure if I actually took a breath through the whole sandwich! If you are wanting a great sandwich made with TLC definitely give McGurkee's a shot.  My staple is Blimpie and Subway, but they don't hold a candle to this place."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sandwich shop in Phoenix HANDS DOWN! Let's cut to the chase...Flavor! These sandwiches have the most delicious sesame sub rolls you could ever dream of. Toasted to perfection. Deli meat is cold and fresh. Just absolutely delicious. This restaurant is family owned and it shows. Service is quick and friendly. You won't find this type of quality any where else."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was but a wee-scout, and my family since they moved to Arizona.  I remember when the rafters were dusty, and the place smelled musky (and looked a lot like the 'burger Works used to).  I kind of miss those days, but I'm a nostalgic fool.  The food here is amazing.  It's a hole-in-the-wall, local known kind of place.  A little known fact that we use every time patronizing this wonderful joint: they do call-in orders.  Because everything is hand made, and they can be swamped at lunch time, this is a Godsend for a hungry hungry hippo, like myself."}
{"text":"Get the super Sicilian! It's amazing. Owners are nice and it is great for a group. Highly recommended when visiting Phoenix"}
{"text":"Still loving sandwiches here! But the parking is atrocious! I damaged my front undercarriage really bad trying to drive through this lot last month :( I figure I'd just buy a 4 x 4 to drive through here and get my sandwiches   1 star for awful parking 5 stars for great food! PS.... This place opens at 11A"}
{"text":"Updating review: I'm going to keep it real quick here. Been eating at McGurkees for about five years now. They have the absolute BEST sub sandwich I have ever had in my life. The Super Sicilian is just beyond good and it's still the only thing I will order. The texture of the bread is perfect, the meats are amazing and it's toasted just right. McGurkees borders very, very close on five stars with me - which means I'd seriously consider driving interstate or even flying international just to eat at this place."}
{"text":"So I must have driven by this place like a zillion times on my drive up to \"Target-to\" at Spectrum, and it was finally when a buddy of mine told me how good this place was that I finally decide to give it a shot.   He recommended the toasted turkey sub with the sesame bread - very specifically the sesame bread. So, sure enough, I give it a whirl, and you know, he was right.  It was a great sandwich. The other choices sounded just as good am I'm sure I'll try 'em. Oh, and the beer choices doesn't hurt towards a good review."}
{"text":"The sesame bread is amazing. The sandwich was huge but I ended up eating the whole thing. Very very good!"}
{"text":"The food was fine - tasty sandwiches.  Once I got my order in, it wasn't a long wait at all.  I did a takeaway order.  I give it only three stars because I didn't feel very welcome.  Even though the three folks behind the counter were busy, could't they at least acknowledge me with a nod or \"be with you in a second\" or something?    Also, it's hard to park here.  There are only about 5-6 spaces in an alley and nothing on the street because of it's location at the corner of two busy streets."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was 10 years old and I must say it's my favorite sandwich shop in Arizona. It reminds me of being a kid. The family that worked the front counter still works the counter 10 years later and I love supporting that! Food Tip: don't try and get fancy here, go for the basic turkey just how it comes!"}
{"text":"Been going here since the late 80s. A family run establishment, creating some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.  From the toasted sesame rolls to the pickles and peppers, it's all about the details. My personal favorite is the Super Sicilian. Incredible!  Notable: The offer beer"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I'd like to give them more stars, but I could get the same quality at a quiznos or subway. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a sandwich here, but if your in the area it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Classic delicious sandwich joint! Classic old school Phoenix! My fav the original roast beef. The sides are so so"}
{"text":"Holy delicousness! I was SO in the mood for a good sandwich....which we all know is few and far between. Everything about this place screamed great sandwich shop. But the best part...the toasted sesame roll. I don't care what kind of sandwich you order off their menu, just get it on that roll. I am so excited for my next sandwich craving so I can go back!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 at best ... they say it is the best sandwich shop in Phoenix? Yikes ... had the artisan chicken sandwich S if came recommended from yelp users ... nothing really special about it to be honest .. best thing about it was the bread .. willing to give it another shot.. maybe a pizza they are better known for? Would take Capriotties over this place any day of the week .   Service not so great .. parking a disaster ( not to mention cars parked way over the line)"}
{"text":"Sandwich shops can sometimes be a rough place for a vegetarians, McGurrkee's is no exception.   The vegetarian options include two salads a veggie sub $7.45 (that is mostly cheese and lettuce) and a Tuna sub which is quasi veg.   For $7+ for the veggie sub  you get a long narrow toasted sesame roll that is good, with 3 types of cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was not bad but some what lacking in the veggie department and low on value."}
{"text":"Great subs and even better atmosphere.  Just stepping into this place, and seeing the decor along with the period fridges for keeping the meat fresh I was in sandwich heaven.  The man behind the counter who took my order was the guy who opened the restaurant about 40 years ago!  In terms of the food, everything was totally on point, with the toasted sesame bun, and the perfect large portion that makes guys like me happy!  While I have had many sandwiches in my life time, I have to say that this is one sits among the best.  You can't ask for more at the end of the day when eating out.  This place does it with flavor and soul, and a glass of wine if you're so inclined!"}
{"text":"Lived in the area for years! Called in order and no answer. Drove to location and was told they only had certain items on limited menu. Never went back. Sorry mcgurkees first impression was a bad one."}
{"text":"Very cool place to eat at! Like all of the history, the news paper hanging on the wall near the cash register kept me busy for at least 1/2 hour! Couldn't imagine how it was back then reading about WWII ! Any way! back to the food, I was in the mood for a quick sandwich near work. So I asked for yelp! Once again yelp did it's job!!!! Had a grilled chicken sandwich on sesame seed roll, it was really good! Sandwich is large so plan on taking half back home or share with your buddy? This is definitely a come back location."}
{"text":"Fuggedaboutit  This was my first visit to McGurkee's but it won't be my last. McGurkee's is a small shop with great character, McGurkee's reminds me of the sandwich shops back home in New York.  McGurkee's has limited parking, because it is so popular with the lunch crowd, so you need to get there early.   The sandwiches at McGurkee's are a cut above the rest.  The bread  at McGurkee's is exactly how I like it;  fresh, toasted, thin, with a crispy crust.  If you can find a  better bread in town please let me know.  The  fillings at MvGurkee's are excellent and very generous.  I had the Sicilian and it was delicious and loaded .  My lunch campionions had the Hero and Roast Beef and they were equally delicious.   If you think you can find a better sandwich shop ...  Fuggedaboutit"}
{"text":"Me and my husband tried this place for the first time and we were NOT disappointed! The food is amazing!! It's a really cute little restaurant, great atmosphere, we will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place a few months ago and ordered the full size Hero sandwhich . Wow ! Like no other sandwhich I have ever eaten . Not sure if they are putting in some \"funny stuff\" but gotta tell ya I am \"hooked\" ! The sesame bread is like no other and the high quality of the meats and cheeses is incomparable with other sub shops in the valley . This is a very small shop , family owned and the people are really service oriented . Just a great place - I eat there at least twice a week for lunch. Recently , they have added some Italian dinner items to their menu and will open for dinner during the week - I am anxious to try this as I am sure it will also be excellent !"}
{"text":"So if you are in the restaurant business for 40 years plus or minus, you must be doing something right.  The first thing they have down is the bread, sesame bread, it is incredible.  Best French loaf around.  Friendly service, clean restaurant and reasonable price point all add to the 5 star review.  Try the Super Sicilian. It truly is Super!"}
{"text":"The food and serviced was ok.  When taking into consideration the postage stamp parking area, this restaurant is not worth the effort.  I don't even think I would visit again if I was parked down the street."}
{"text":"Read about this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The owners are great and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant (I had never seen anyone cleaning the bottom of the table while bussing before today.)  Hubby had a regular size Sicillian. I chose the half size meatball. Hubby declared his sandwich okay, if you have read any of my other reviews you know this is high praise. I loved my sandwich. The sauce consistency was just right - not too much and thick enough to avoid making the sandwich gooey. The meatballs had a great taste and between the sauce and meatballs there was a slight kick.  Hubby declared he will be back for the food and to enjoy the ambiance. That is second way to tell he liked this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops in town, been coming here for years.. Super Sicilian is the best.."}
{"text":"This is such an appealing sandwich shop.  The inside is spectacularly pretty in an old style.  There are beautiful wood casings and walls.  The counter where you order is also beautiful and wooden.  The sandwiches are delicious with generous portions of high quality meats and cheeses.  When you want a sandwich but don't want the typical crap you get from Subway or one of the other chains come here and enjoy a yummy sandwich in an interesting and beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this establishment since I was a kid! Food is ALWAYS delicious and service is excellent! Always wished there was more parking but, worth the short walk if you have to park elsewhere!!! The Super Sicilian sandwich is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Cant believe I'd been missing out on this place! Its like a different world. Very old school feel. The vintage fridge behind the counter is such a cool feature. Best feature is the gentleman running the counter though. Fits the part perfectly.  Oh yeah the food... I had the pepper steak sandwich with a side of au jus and a pickle. Heaven, and very decent price IMO."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and absolutely love their subs, especially the Athenian Chicken and Super Sicilian!  Their delicious sesame rolls are toasted to perfection.  Parking can be a little tricky, but it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"We tried McGurkee's for the first time today for lunch. Absolutely delicious!!! I got the turkey sandwich with onion roll, so much turkey and so yummy. The hubby got the pepper steak sandwich. He was raving about it, I tried a bite so delicious!! So full of flavor. My son got the meatball sandwich with provolone cheese, he said it's the best he's ever had! The people are also very friendly. We will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Get the Super Sicilian...you won't be disappointed. I love this place and go there regularly!"}
{"text":"I've been hitting up this spot since way back when. This is the first time I've reviewed it though. The staff that took care of me back when I first started coming here is the same staff that helped me the last time that I was in here. Athenian chicken is soooo good! The bread has great flavor and toasted just right. The inside always seems a bit smoky when I go which causes my eyes to tear up a little, but the smell is great, the food is good, and the people are nice. They do sell beer and wine here so have a glass or bottle while you enjoy your specialty sub."}
{"text":"Oh the Super Sicillian, it really is Super, and Yummy, and Delicious, and Craveable, and the Bomb Diggity For Real Yo, and Amazing, and Toasty, and and and..."}
{"text":"Such a charming and relaxingly casual place for pizza or a sandwich. The staff was welcoming and kind. Can't wait to go back and sit on their adorable patio in the back.  Also, the food was so good! Thrilled to live so nearby this gem."}
{"text":"McGurkee's is Marvelous: I have been eating at McGurkee's on 15th Avenue and Thomas since I was a student in college or since 1995. It has the same owners because it is a family owned business. It simply has the best sub sandwiches I have ever eaten. I could tell the mechanics of what they do to them, the toasted bread (long before Quizno's and much better), the lettuce, the meats. But they add something else that just marries all the flavors together. I don't know what it is; I understand it is a secret recipe written in Greek that only the owners know (the owners are Greek Americans), but whatever it is, it just takes a good sandwich and makes it great! The sandwiches are worth the drive. DO NOT look at the menu, just order the Super Sicilian like Andrew said, I like to bite the tips off the pepers that are served with it and dump the seeds and juices in the sub.  As for the price, its close to the big named sub companies...though they are second to none in flavor! The shop is a little shop, can house arround 25 people. I would sugest to go when its not lunch rush. When you have little more time on your hands, besides you want to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix area for 20 years and the Super Sicilian is the best sub in the valley.  This family owned business is no frills  and little has changed.  The owner and his son run the shop and you might see one other \"hired help\".  Don't be surprised if you have to bus your own table before and after eating.  Alley parking limits the crowds but don't expect quick service.  I've never had anything but the Super Sicilian or Italiano, neither will disappoint.  Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great homemade sub and deli sandwiches in the Valley !  The toasted sun roll is key when making this hearty delicious sub.  Fresh meats and crisp veggies add that extra touch.  Very clean mom and pops deli at its finest.  That good home cooked meal in a warm cozy place.  From the Subs to the Sandwiches, Pita and salads for lunch , you can't find this anywhere else here in Phoenix.  The Owner Ted takes so much pride in his delicious food.  Great place for a hardy lunch  it's a must if you've never been here !"}
{"text":"the best toasted sub rolls ever and price was super fair  if you're  passing by you must stop in highly recommended"}
{"text":"I recently saw this place on my drive home. I don't know how I have never been here before, but I recently moved and take a new route, and this shop is on my route home.   I have found my new favorite sandwich place! I tried the Sicilian, and it was fantastic. As others said, the sesame bread is fantastic. The sub is toasted so the meats are warm and the cheese is melted. You get real slices of ham (not deli thin slices you usually get on chain sub shop subs). I might try others but this one was so good I don't know if I can get anything else. The small sub is more than enough for a meal, and the price for a sandwich, chips and drink was less than $10.   The parking lot is definitely small, if you go around lunch time it is easiest just to park on the street just south of the restaurant.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have lived in Phoenix my whole life and have been missing my favorite sandwich.  I tried the Italiano.  It has all the ingredients of you traditional Italian sub.  The meats are perfect. The rich Italian dressing is perfect.  The toasted sesame bread is the kicker.    I have had this sandwich at many venues before, but this is the best I have ever had.  The prices are right; not free as some reviewers have hyperbolically suggested. I am afraid you just made a lifer and an addict out of me!"}
{"text":"This will be my 20th year since I discovered this place.  The cool thing is everybody that works there now, has always worked there.  They're always very nice to me and give great service.  I've had a few different things from the menu and have never been disappointed.  The French Dip is phenomenal however the one thing that I beg you all to try is the Super Sicilian sandwich.  Get it exactly how they make it, dont ask for anything left out or put on extra, just try it one time.  I seriously ate it the first 10 years I went there without even trying anything else.  It is my favorite sandwich in the world.  This is a Mom and Pop restaurant and has a great cozy feel of it.  Its such a great thing to have in a world of Subways and Quiznos where the food is bland and the faces are never the same.  I live 40 miles from McGurkees and still make it a point to stop in and get food as often as I can."}
{"text":"McGurkee's, Im going to make this short my new found friend....Mad deliciousness is over-come at an even more delicious price. It's got this weird Irish Pub thing going on, yet it's an Italian Sub Shop. I got the Super Sicilian  - $6.50/ whole or $3.45/ half. The toasted Kaiser sub roll is pretty full of goodness on its own. And have fun flagging down a parking place because if its full and Im pretty sure it's full of \"local flavor\" inside too. The place only seats 12."}
{"text":"This place has been around for 40+ years and we just discovered it about a month ago...It is amazing and I wish I could have found it sooner! I have the albacore tuna sub and my boyfriend has the turkey sub. I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Bad service, waited about 20 min to get order in. Stood at counter, nobody greeted you. You walk in and smells like burnt bread. Now I have the smell lingering on my hair and clothes..the guy in kitchen kept slamming doors. He did not look happy."}
{"text":"Killer sandwich! First time visitor, had the Super Sicilian as many reviews suggested. I really enjoyed that it was thicker slices of the meats, as if hand carved. The toasted sesame crusty roll is really tasty and it gets a tiny bit of black on the edges as some of the images suggest. It adds great flavor. Price is very reasonable, had terrible sandwiches for much more. I think I'll ask for extra tomato next time but that's the only thing I'll change. Interior is quaint, rich wood all over, maybe 10 tables inside. Didn't check out the patio. Not much parking but I was there after 1 so it was after any rush and no issue getting a space and getting back out. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a keeper. Best sandwich that I've had in a very very long time. Bread is fantastic!  Had the Super Sicilian and that was the best. Gotta try this place if you haven't done so."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for 15years When I'm on this side of Phx... Ted n his family will treat you as you are their own family ... very cute hidden Gem... sandwiches are made when order. #TedThanksForAlwaysLookingOut #AlwaysPacked #GreatFamilyOwnBusiness"}
{"text":"The Super Sicilian is worth the five stars.  Toasted sesame roll and the meats and cheeses are great. Nice atmosphere with about 12 smaller tables.  Parking does kind of suck...had to park about a block away. They only have about 10 spots-but I'm rating the food not the parking."}
{"text":"The name of this Eye-Talian joint is Irish, the food Irish-bland, the counter help (owner?) unfriendly, indifferent...why would I ever go back?  My meal was forgettable. I took one bite and wondered aloud why the hell I even stopped.   Fo-get-about-it!"}
{"text":"Super Sicilian and the Meatball subs are amazing, the only draw back is the burnt bread funk you'll sport the rest of the day.  Not recommended for folks that claims they don't go out for lunch. :)"}
{"text":"There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did."}
{"text":"WOW. My buddy has been telling me to check this place out for months. This past weekend I finally did, and I am hooked. I see repeat returns to this amazing sandwich shop in my very near future. I ordered the Super Sicilian (again at the advice of my buddy), and that thing was stacked thick with fresh delicious cold cuts and cheese, then toasted in the oven and served with pepperoncinis and a pickle on the side. Pretty much the perfect lunch! I love finding little gems like this in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Love the decor, the food, the service... hidden gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Italian subs are excellent - which is why I am here HOWEVER, the ridiculously obscene amount of time it takes to get one half sub is appalling! I have been waiting 35 minutes for a sub that is made 300 times a day.  Service is painfully slow and they are sold out of everything but who cares because the sandwiches are good so service, etc doesn't matter! My first negative yelp review ever (I think) but I'm on my lunch hour which is not enough time to come here. : ("}
{"text":"I go to this place at least once a week the owners are amazing and make it a point to go above and beyond with customer service. The barbecue chicken sandwich and Super Sicilian are both amazing. Definitely should check it out!"}
{"text":"I went here again.  I think that repeated visits get better overall.  Their meatball sub is pretty good, however, the bread choice makes it somewhat difficult to eat, because the meatballs keep wanting to escape out the sides.  Any restaurant that offers a meatball sub should either slice the meatballs in half or provide bread that can contain the meatballs.  This is just common sense.  This time I took a friend and she noticed the smokiness as well.  Instead of waiting inside the restaurant, I had us sit outside.  It was better, but I still noticed that the smoke clung to my clothes even after we left.  This is a frustrating characteristic that seriously detracts from J.P. McGurkee's.  For a place that has been around so long, you'd think they would have installed a decent ventilation system.  Instead, the smoke just blows back into the dining area."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best French dip I've ever had in my life.  Completely worth the $8"}
{"text":"This sandwich is straight up awesome. I only ever get the Super Sicilian, so cannot comment on the rest of the menu, but this one sando is 5 stars all day long.  Don't forget about the outdoor patio in the back. Makes for a great lunch now that the weather is cooperating."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and have heard very good things from friends that have tried it. I ordered a meatball sub and hot dog to go. The hot dog came butterflied on a toasted sesame bun and the meatball had good sized portion meatballs with a tasty sauce and cheese on a toasted bun. I am a meatball snob but really enjoyed the sandwich. I can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu and eat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was comfortable and warm and the customer service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Just left this place without getting food. The girl that tried to ring me up had no idea what she was doing with writing the ticket, the menu, prices and using the register. The owner (I'm assuming) came out from the back, didn't help AT ALL and left the girl clueless. She told me I could pay later, it seemed like she just didn't want to deal with it. Leaving untrained employees to deal with customers on their own is not okay. And as the owner, walking away from the situation is even worse. I waited over 20 minutes for two sandwiches (take out) and when I asked what was up with my order they hadn't even started on it yet. There was only 3 tables of people and all of them already had their food. When I confronted the owner she *calmly* argued with me. I'm hoping this doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"The pasta was amazing and the people were extremely friendly.  Try the iced tea!"}
{"text":"If you like to eat a great sandwich this is your place. Absolutely fabulous the bread Is incredible, 12 to 15 inches of the best toasted bread You have ever had Ever this sandwich itself may only be about 3 inches wide but they make up for it in The longest of the sandwich"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. You gotta check out this Phoenix landmark. My first time here. I had the super sicilian and it was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am a big sandwich fan!!! These are delish! The sesame bread is the best. It has a light crust with the perfect give and soft interior. Parking is horrible, but it's worth it to find someplace to park. My fiancé LOVED the roast beef, and he is not a sandwich person.  The decor is cute, and the service is super friendly. If you love sandwiches, try it. It's better than any chain I have tasted."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and have to give more props, love the subs (my waistline does not)."}
{"text":"I had a craving for an Italian Sub so I gave this place a try. It was fantastic! Made the old-fashioned way on a toasted sesame roll & served with pepperocini & pickle spears. I'll be a regular for certain."}
{"text":"This place is great as far as local sandwich shops go!  The sandwich bread is the unique thing about this place as it has a flavor you can't find anywhere else.  It's a little place on the corner that has limited seating and can take a bit longer than a fast food place but that's part of what goes into a good meal.  Everything is made to order and it's pretty busy because it's that good... so it takes a little extra time to get your food.  Its family owned and the people there are super nice and genuinely want you to enjoy your meal.  I've only been coming here for a short time since I've moved into the state and I drive from 30 minutes away just to eat here.    One bad review out of 25..and if you read the bad review it sounds like it could be the guy who owns the place down the street that he is talking about??  Anyhow, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've ate here 4 times now. After navigating the menu and asking the staff, I went with the staple sandwich which is the Super Sicilian. Super happy I did. All of their subs come toasted on sesame bread from what I've seen. I never thought to much about sesame buns however toasted really sets those seeds off.   I think the secret of success for this sandwich peddler is their combination of good ingredients, toasted buns and family business small town curb appeal. I'll keep coming back with a smile. C"}
{"text":"Wow! I wish I'd discovered this place sooner. My neighbor took me here for dinner for my birthday. Food is outstanding! I had spaghetti and meatballs (better than Spaghetti Factory IMO). Salad was great! I'm not sure if they make their own Italian dressing, but it was just awesome! Great atmosphere and friendly service. My wife and I will be revisiting soon!"}
{"text":"Simple, fast, inexpensive, and tastes great. But there's no pizza.   Seriously, the sign implies there's pizza here, and that's what I was in the mood for, but they serve none. I was going to rage quit, but the last stretch of my lunch break was flashing before my eyes, and I needed grub RIGHT AWAY. McGurkee's came through, and I have no regrets.   It's a little mom & pop sub shop. There is only one type of bread: dense, flavorful sesame rolls that remind you of what bread has the potential to be when not mass-produced with ingredients also found in yoga mats.   Everyone raved about the Sicilian, so I picked that. It was less than 5 dollars and ready to go in less than 5 minutes. These employees are awesome! With above-average quality cold cuts, I soon stopped missing all the other sandwich shops in town. Definitely coming back to try them all."}
{"text":"Easy to park alongside, although can get busy.. LOVE the decor and atmosphere inside, transports you away... The food is outstanding! The bread is fresh and tastes wonderful, the veggies are crisp and flavorful and the various meats are top notch. I believe the 'trick' is to arrive after the rush when it's more leisurely and you can savor the experience."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches!   We stopped in for dinner last night. He was craving an Italian sub and I was just plane hungry. We were both equally satisfied!  Apparently they have been there for like 40 years or some thing and have sold millions of their Super Italian Sub, impressive. It was tasty too. I can totally understand why they are so sought after. I mean if you are able to keep your business for over 40 years you must be doin something right. I love their sub rolls too, perfectly toasted sessamy buns!  They are a simple little shop, with offerings from salads, to pizza (none over $10), to hot or cold subs, calzones, and pasta. Something to please anyone. They also sell beer and wine, simple but sometimes simple is what you really need.   If you are in the area, or even if you aren't, get your butt in there and have some good food!"}
{"text":"I should have ordered something else.  I got the French dip sub and a soda.  The bread was covered in sesame seeds, was extremely crisp,  and had a sharp burnt taste to it.  Hardly any beef compared to bun.  It was necessary to use the Au Jus just to soften up the bread enough to eat, and offset the burnt taste."}
{"text":"Came from California with a cheer team. They were easily able to accommodate 40 people. Food was tasty, excellent service, great prices, loved the ambiance. They even gave our girls cookies at no charge and sent a container of cookies for them on competition day. Great team dinner spot. Will definitely go there again when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Delicious. Cheap. Friendly. Quick (if you want it to be!). What more could you ask for?  The atmosphere at McGurkee's is reminiscent of an old town go-to with the friendliest staff in the valley. The sandwiches are inexpensive and are, in my opinion, the best Italian subs in AZ. Get the Sicilian if you want to know what a real sub tastes like.  Overall, go to McGurkee's. It'd be impossible to leave disappointed."}
{"text":"McGrurkee's has been around forever!  My mom used to go there when she was in high school. My friends went when they were in HS. And I finally got to try it a few years ago and try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood!    I haven't had a bad sandwich there, but my favorite is the super Sicilian. It is meaty with a good combination of meats. The toasted bread is good and pepper on the side helps to give it a little kick."}
{"text":"just fell into this place today and WOW what a gem  GREAT sandwiches  I had the super sicilian and it was fantastic!  great meats  great toasted bread  great cheese and great dressing  wish I had found this place sooner  I will be back to try their pizza which is only served at dinner.  friendly staff and great service   one of only a few great sandwich shops I have found in Phoenix    a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Clients choice Real Estate meeting just found my new favorite sandwich shop. The Super Sicilian was excellent!! Heard that I need to try the roast beef. We will be back soon. Thanks Teddy and thanks for the introduction Billy and Catherine Gumm!!!"}
{"text":"Great deli sandwiches! They pile the sandwiches with tasty meat and use fresh breads. Awesome lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've had in the valley, bar none.  The Super Sicilian is my go-to, and I have to say, their toasted bread with its delicious sprinkling of sesame seeds is worth the trip even if it didn't surround a wonderful sandwich prepared by the owner and his family.   I only wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Place was on hitt! Had the Super Sicilian. Toasted sesame on a light, fresh crunchy eye-talion roll. Never  had spicy ham on a sandwich-on Point!"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a bit now and decided to head down here for lunch.  i went with the \"Super Sicilian\" which is their version of an Italian Sub.  That and a large fountain drink came out to just over $10.00.  Here is how it was.........  Super Sicilian-  This sub comes with 2 kinds of salami, 2 kinds of ham, capicolla, Swiss, pepper and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  All of this comes on a toasted, seeded, Italian style roll.  First bite in, I knew it was a great sandwich!  The meats are cut rather thick (think hand carved), the cheese was incredibly melty, the produce was fresh as could be, and that roll had the perfect amount of toast/crunch on it, but never once hardened up like a crouton or anything like that.  The sesame seeds provided great texture and overall, I really liked it!  Definitely one of the better sandwiches I have had in Phoenix.  Overall, I will be back.  It is a bit of a journey down there, but the sandwich was great!  I really want to try out their chicken caccittori and meatball sub next.  Service was friendly, and this place is old school!  The only negatives I encountered were limited and tight parking, and their fountain lemonade was messed up and had too much syrup to water ratio (just add some more water to your beverage and it will dilute itself).  Other than those 2 minor gripes, it was a great sandwich and I am glad I made it down here."}
{"text":"It's been 20 years since I've eaten here. Just like I remember it! Super Bomb! In fact taking my 2 year old down there to try the pizza! Must try!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place easy to pass by nice lil patio outside, had the super Sicilian sandwich on their toasted sesame seed sub roll good, ok potato salad, ok coleslaw, nice pickle spear."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place many of times. So one day for lunch I tried it. There bread is homemade and so is there pizza. I love this place will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"When work is looking like a crap day, all I need is a sandwich from here, or a salad to put me back in a good mood.   The greek salad with chicken to be exact.  Subs sandwiches are served toasted on really good bread rolls.  The tuna is one of my favs.  There isn't a lot of seating but enough. It can get busy around lunch time so I always recommend going for a late lunch--- around 1/1:30pm."}
{"text":"I finally gave in to the husband's request to come to McGurkees. This place is in my neighborhood and it's cuter inside than you would think. You walk up to the counter to place your order and I'm pretty sure we ordered with the owner, who seemed like a nice guy. I was a little disappointed because the sign says they have pizza, but really they only have sandwiches... a little disappointing. I had the meatball sub with cheese and a salad. The salad is basic rabbit salad with that gloppy italian dressing you can get for a dollar at the grocery store.... you know what I'm talking about. Not impressive. The sandwich was fine, if a bit bland. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about it. I might be back due solely to proximity but I wouldn't run back here for any reason."}
{"text":"The Bread! Only place outside of San Francisco, were the bread taste this good!  Coming to this restaurant since my junior college days at Phoenix junior college we're talking 1981, yet the bread was special then & still the same. They offer about 12 different sub choices the super Sicilian is super great. Beer and wine selections too."}
{"text":"This place is a downtown Phoenix classic for 2 really simple reasons: 1) the food is awesome and 2) the owners (a family) provide awesome service!   I am partial to their turkey and cheese sandwich on a sesame seed hoagie roll toasted with just the right amount of crunch. My lunch isn't complete without a side of their tasty potato salad and a cold beverage. The best!"}
{"text":"I'm a sandwich junkie, and this place is my favorite.  Often very busy at lunch time because of their big selection of delicious sandwich's.  The service is always great and ALL of the sandwiches are always delicious!  I highly recommend stopping in and checking it out!"}
{"text":"After a long day, I was trying to grab a late lunch.  I saw this place pop up on Yelp, so I hustled over to get there before it closed.  The manager (I think) was really accommodating, even though I snuck in a bit before closing.  I got a Super Sicilian, and a beer, after he kindly showed me the beer selection.  The Agave Wheat was a great choice for the hot day.  And the sandwich...holy moly.  It was fantastic.  Big, meaty, well dressed...what a sandwich!  It was a bit too big for my appetite, but I had to finish it!  Which my stomach did regret ;)  The food was great, and the service was excellent.  Just what I needed on that afternoon.  Next time I am in town, I'll try to stop by again.  Check out the Agave Wheat if they have it there.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a great sandwich and friendly service! My favorite is the Sicilian! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Super Sicilian.  Extremely flavorful, and the toasted sesame bread adds to it.  And the interior is very neat..like entering into one of those Phoenix time capsules around the valley!"}
{"text":"Lacking in choice small oven that really is a bizarre set up for a restaurant.... needs updating..bland food on the whole over rated.... I disagree that this is a good sandwich bar...."}
{"text":"My friends and I were recommended this place by a coworker who said it was awesome. My two friends loved their sandwiches, especially the meatball which they both said was absolutely delicious. I don't eat meat and cheese and the older gentleman who worked at the register was very pleasant and accommodating. We settled on the pepper steak filling (peppers and onions) along with other veggies and olives.  When the order came up, I received a sandwich with only lettuce, tomato, raw onions (which I had specifically asked to not get), and cucumbers. I went back up to the counter and asked about my sandwich and was told (rudely) by the sandwich maker that they were out of the peppers and onions as well as the olives. The older gentleman who had helped me earlier apologized profusely. He knew there were olives and gave me a small cup for my sandwich. I was not offered another alternative, nor was I offered any money back (I paid almost $10 for the sandwich). I had also not been told that there would be alterations (the sandwich maker was conferred with prior to submitting my order to determine that it could be done).  This is not a vegetarian-friendly establishment so I don't recommend going there if you are avoiding meat products and are asking for alternatives. The wait for the food takes a significant period of time and although the cashier is very pleasant, don't attempt to have a friendly conversation with anyone else who works there as they can be rude."}
{"text":"How in the world have I missed this place? This place transplanted me right back to my NY roots. I can just see this place in Queens right up to the timely, wrought iron enclosed small patio area that opens up into a shady parking lot. Hahahaha! The previous reviews were right about the parking oddities, to say the least. No parking  lines and you are not sure where you should park since it is not a flat area. I went to the restaurant earlier and I recommend you should too. They say they open at 11am but I got served at 10:30.  I got a half meatball sub, potato salad and a pickle. It was one of the best Meatball subs I have had in AZ. I know granted that is not saying much but the sub was really good! However, what is really wonderful here is the bread. Delish! They make their own. AZ is sorely lacking in the bread dept and it is one of the best sub rolls I have ever had. I will have to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches best bread, had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was a great experience with the homemade bread, pastrami meat and the condiments included, would not change a thing.  Did I mention the bread? It is toasted and has a great taste and firm consistency.  The restaurant is an older quaint building which is nice and fun. better   One of the best sandwiches in town."}
{"text":"The pizza sign brought us in. They don't have pizza but god damn they have the best Italian subs. This place is DELICIOUS"}
