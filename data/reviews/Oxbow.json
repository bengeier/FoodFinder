{"text":"This was a fantastic choice while staying in Calgary. My wife and I enjoyed the charcuterie board which had 5 exceptional meat choices. She went with the Salmon and thought the lime pea mash complimented the salmon well and I thoroughly enjoyed the bison flank steak. If I ever come back to Calgary I will definitely make this a stop while here. Just to put the cherry on top, the service was fantastic. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have tried oxbow a few times over the last month. The location is amazing, love the al fresco dining experience and the servers are very professional.  Unfortunately the food does not measure up to the hype. Maybe I am to used to the amazing Chefs table dishes that were at this location previously, but I wanted more. For the appetizers we tried, most were very good. For the mains we tried the flank steak (was tough and not prepared the best), the striploin (overcooked and was not happy with the African spices), the lamb (was very good), and the chorizo pasta (lacking flavor, boring and bland).  We have it a few tries since we love the location, but we won't be back.  If the review was based only on the food, was only 1.5 stars. But the location and server quality brings it up to at least a two star.  The creativity of the chefs is lacking. The potential is there for a great restaurant but food needs to be the star."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service.  I'm staying here in the hotel and, due to time restrictions in my schedule, decided to eat here for dinner and breakfast.  This was definitely my lucky day because the food is amazing.  The pea and ricotta gnocchi is so delicious!  I would definitely order this again.  I wanted to order the Prix Fixe menu, but unfortunately they had sold out of it by the time I got there.  (A good sign!  I need to come back!)     For breakfast, the stand out dish for me was the Berry Smoothie bowl.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but my dish was not only Breakfast Art, but it was so delicious that I'd love to have this every morning!    The bartender here was also great.  My sister ordered me a cocktail (unfortunately, I don't know the name of it) and I really liked it.  Staff here is so personable and nice - I loved the whole meal experience and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having just had the brunch of my life I can honestly say this is one of the best restaurants in Calgary. Ma√Ætre d' Matt Holy is a registered beautician. Next time you're here tell him Riggidy sent you. He'll know."}
{"text":"Chef-based menu with great flavour and a wonderful location.  We plan to return soon.  The eggplant was a delight and I would love the chicken liver as as a main dish as it outshines the breast.  How can I make this at home?!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to explore Oxbow for awhile. Last night we had the opportunity to check out their happy hour. I've sat in the restaurant before and since the last time we were there they put in a beautiful lobby bar.   The happy hour wine was a Sangiovese and was outstanding. Great value at $5 a glass. The duck wings were on special for happy hour and we ended up having a couple of orders they were so good. The warm artichoke dip was flavourful and delicious.   The service was impeccable, we were welcomed and not rushed. The staff were always checking in without being intrusive. We spent 2.5 hours there and had a fantastic time. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice restaurant for the last night of our vacation and Oxbow did not disappoint. Everything from the atmosphere, to the service and especially the food was amazing. The restaurant has a main dining room, and a smaller dining room that looks into the open kitchen, which was really cool! We started with the smoked albacore tuna and the white bean hummus appetizers, both of which were super flavorful and creative dishes. For my entree, I ordered the beef striploin with potatoes, turnips and the most amazing chermoula sauce. I seriously would have eaten a cardboard box if it had that sauce on it. Unfortunately it looked so amazing I forgot to take a pic, whoops! For dessert I ordered the white chocolate mousse with chocolate brownie and sour cherry compote and it was the perfect ending to a wonderful evening. If you're in the area you should definitely make a stop at Oxbow a priority."}
