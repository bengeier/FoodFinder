{"text":"Well, to start off, I got the build your own medium salad bowl.  Added the organic baked tofu, black beans, corn, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and then added some greek vinaigrette on the side.  My total was 8.10, which was a little pricier than I bargianed for, but it all looked fresh so I was ok with this.  I do like that if I were to order directly off the menu, they have calorie counts available for all their selectioins listed right beside the item name, which is REALLY great, since almost nowhere does this; very convienent for those watching their intake.  Anyways, I ate at one of the many tables they have available outside, which is in a pretty secluded area that is aesthetically pleasing, so I really enjoyed this aspect.  Unfortunately, the salad itself lacked a little.  For one, none of the items tasted very fresh except for the lettuce, and the cherry tomatoes tasted almost stale.  The tofu was also very bland, and although the menu never stated it would be seasoned with anything, I just assumed they would have added some sort of spice since it is afterall, tofu.    To be fair, I did just move to the area from Charleston, SC so I have been spoiled with really great, local fresh food at most restaurants, but based on the description I was really hoping this would be a taste of the freshness at home, which unfortunately it was not.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing and it wasn't awful by any means, just definitely a little bit of a let down from my high expectations after seeing reviews.  Suggestions?  I know it's not strictly salads, but they really should work on upgrading their salad selections because I feel like a lot of people go to a healthy store like this for salad, and especially at that price point customers should be getting a little bit better quality.  Also, a selection rather than just one type of lettuce would be really nice.    Anyways, overall average experience food-wise, really nice atmosphere though and I may return one day for a sandwich or something, but for now I'll continue on my hunt for the freshest Charlotte salad I can find."}
{"text":"Best health food in town. The whole UberDog Training staff eats here. Even the dogs get a snack."}
{"text":"Great experience... full menu of healthy food that fits a busy schedule.  Energy Cafe will be a regular lunch stop for sure."}
{"text":"Below average \"white walled\" healthy lunch place. The food was cold and not tasty, and the service, detailed below, was pretty bad.  Very small portions for the price.    They switched my order with someone else's.  Then, when they switched it back my order was still wrong (because they got it wrong when they took it and didn't bother to ask), so they had to make it again.  All in all waited about 12 minutes.  #firstworldproblems."}
{"text":"Good sandwich option for lunch uptown. I had the Lean Mean Tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Got the special today, a meatball eggplant wrap.  The meatball was very cold and nasty.  Can't believe they have the audacity to serve something like that."}
{"text":"Monday lunch rush and this line is Flying! The food assembly is beyond efficient and the cashiers are smiling. $7 for a chic n cheez wrap. They got a little ambitious with the panini press it it was still good. They also have healthy smoothies from Green Bros - might have to try one next time i need another quick lunch Uptown."}
{"text":"I love Energy Cafe! It has become a lunchtime favorite for me when I am in the Charlotte area. It is so refreshing to find a restaurant that cares about what they are feeding people. Energy Cafe provides detailed nutritional information for all of the items on their menu which is helpful for anyone trying to stay in shape.The cafe has two locations, one of which is conveniently located beneath the Charlotte Athletic Club. This makes Energy Cafe the perfect place to swing by and grab a yummy 'Doc' Holladay smoothie after working out. Did I mention the amazing cafe design? Energy Cafe is a very forward thinking restaurant. This is not only evident in its menu choices, but its overall atmosphere. ***** and two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot for the uptown worker.  It is breakfast\lunch sandwich shop with organic and healthy menu.  Perfect food for a post workout lunch.  Great sandwiches with all natural flavorful ingredients.  Has become my standard place to eat."}
{"text":"Arnold Wrap is really good - but I don't think I'll be back soon because $8.50 for a wrap is insane."}
{"text":"This place started good but has been in a slow decline and is about to lose my repeat business for good. The toppings for the salads get skimpier and skimpier, and now you have to pay extra for cheese, even though they throw on just a few sprinkles that hardly adds anything to the salad. Incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"Tons of protein in their smoothies - organic & all natural fruity ingredients..... which is a very nice change from the ice cream, treaty-like smoothies I'm used to seeing around  Sandwich wraps, salads, & soups that offer many veggie options as well as gluten-free to boot - woot!  We've tried their Quinoa Salad as well as their hummus & pita - both yummy  Energy bars are - \"homemade\" every day - Pumpkin Walnut was okay - the hummus & quinoa were better  Can't wait to come back for more smoothies & lunchie items ... I feel healthier already"}
{"text":"Where's the love for this place?  It seems like most people bypass this place on the way to the other lunch options down the corridor.  Well, this place has some of the better seating options, and the food is fresh and tasty.  I liked the Energy Cafe Signature Salad and the tortilla soup, both good lunch sized portions.  And they also have free frozen yogurt samples to round out a good meal.  I haven't tried the smoothies, but it would be hard to beat Jamba Juice nearby."}
{"text":"Finally, it's nice to have a place like this Uptown! This is a fabulous alternative to the fast food, unhealthy joints that seem to be a staple for many. They offer fresh, healthy food along with smoothies and protein bars (or fuel bars as they call them) at a reasonable price. Anytime I've been they are super quick with making your food right in front of you and although there is usually a line, it moves pretty quick.   I love how they put the nutritional stats on their menu so you can see how much you're taking in (plus they have stats for protein and fiber as opposed to just cals/fat). They also have many vegetarian options. Their medium build your own salad is the best deal---$5.99 with unlimited toppings and only $1.49 if you want to add protein (although I usually bring chicken or tofu from home). They have a varied selection of dressings along with low fat options for the creamier ones and their Greek vinaigrette is amazing ---it has chunks of feta in it and anything that brings more cheese into my life is a good thing. Great prices, quick service, generous portions-I dig."}
{"text":"$5 for disgusting oatmeal. Tough to screw up. Have also been here for lunch a few times - similarly unimpressive and overpriced. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Energy Cafe is in a great location, with a large covered outdoor seating area. there's also lots of outdoor seating just a few steps away in front of the museum. (They do have indoor seating as well, of course.)  The Southwest Turkey wrap is great. My favorite. In addition to sandwiches, they also have smoothies, salads, juices, and coffee drinks. All healthy foods and pretty good tasting.  Unfortunately, no wifi as of this review, but sometimes you can snag a nearby connection."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch to get wraps, salads, etc but my favorite is the protein packed Arnold which has egg whites, chicken, turkey bacon,  avocado, etc but I get w/o cheese.  It is really good, especially combined with an Alo drink (with aloe pulp and grapefruit- yummy!) The prices are a bit on the steep side and I do wish that everything was organic.  At this location, they don't have a ton of close competition though, so I won't opt for Blynk next door (like their other location).  They have a good variety of energy bars, both made themselves and other companies. Perfect combo with the new Flex & Fit in the building.  My only complaint about this location? It is hotter than 47 hells in there. I don't know if its the modern funky lighting or what but I wanted to run away. Maybe they've got it worked out now. Hopefully."}
{"text":"Worst. Breakfast sandwich. Ever. I asked for a multigrain croissant sandwich with egg white and bacon. The person making my sandwich didn't offer me any other toppings or options besides cheese and there was no posted menu so it was unclear what else came on the sandwich. The total came to $5.62 which I thought was a tad pricey for a breakfast sandwich only but some of their food is expensive anyways. I took my food to go and when I got to work I opened the wrapper to discover a sad little tortilla with nothing but a tiny bit of bland egg white drowning in cheese and nothing else. I guess I should have checked the sandwich while I was still there but call me crazy if I feel I should be able to order food to go and expect it to be correct when I get it to my destination."}
{"text":"This place is fine. It's hidden away so it's hard to find, which might explain why it's always pretty empty, or it might have a lack of customers because it's offerings are fine but not spectacular.   I ordered a salad with no meat, they put meat on it. After I got the meat off, I discovered that my salad was just meh -- the kind of stuff I could've made for myself on the Harris Teeter salad bar -- and even with their reasonable prices I can't say I'm particularly interested in going back again. That said, if a coworker wants to grab lunch there together, I won't run the other direction.   Half-priced smoothies from 2-5!"}
{"text":"Had oatmeal- was very good, generous toppings. Also had the juice- typical fresh juice... Yummy! Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad the other day and the chicken tasted like rubber, over all bland salad. Find it way over priced for the quality and size of portions."}
{"text":"I was interested in this place - it looked like a it would be a good/fun/healthy place to grab a quick bite. I got the egg delight sandwich - egg whites, turkey bacon, cheddar cheese, tomato, guacamole all on multi-grain bread. Sounds good right....well sort of. The turkey bacon was a bit chewy (defiantly was popped in the microwave not on the grill) and the egg was pre-made and popped in the microwave as well. Other than that - it was good. I am not saying that I wouldn't come back here again - I just think I would opt for a cold sandwich instead. Maybe something like the hummus sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, portion s are a little small ( at least for what I order ed). Will return soon"}
{"text":"Now I know what other yelpers mean when they write, \"I really wanted to like this place.\" I was so excited to find this healthy options shop on yelp. I am always trying to eat healthy and it's surprisingly still difficult to find healthy food that is convenient. Located in the Bank of America Plaza, it gets very busy at lunch. I was there at high noon and the place was packed. I liked how they had a nutrition chart right next to the menu and how it was easy to read.   I chose the Towering Turkey and Cheddar (474 calories at $6.95) on multigrain bread. It was layered with shredded cheese, spinach, organic low sodium sliced turkey, carrots, cucumber, tomato, and drizzled with some type of low fat mayo. Thank goodness for the mayo, cucumber, and tomato because the sandwich was pretty dry. Avocado might help or maybe some hummus? Perhaps they need to choose another type of bread. It was crumbly and had difficulty holding up to the \"towering\" ingredients.   The set up is similar to Subway where the sandwich is passed down. Service was quick and efficient. My name was called out to pick up my sandwich before I finished paying.  I'm not going to write off this place yet. I still want to LIKE it because I LOVE the concept and the EFFORT to provide healthy options. The Power Packed Chicken Sandwich seemed very popular and it looked really good and so did their salads. They had an offer written on their A-frame outside their store: \"Bring your receipt in from this week on Friday (3/8) and receive 15% off.\"  I'm in favor of second chances, so you know where I'll be on Friday for lunch ;)"}
{"text":"Healthy food is a passion of mine and I always love when I can find a restaurant that makes it taste good too.   5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I ordered avocado toast which was 6.49$ with tax which was just one slice of bread and avocado piece and chili flakes n sesame seed which I really felt was not worth it . Food is fresh no complains there but just the price for that toast was not right ! Also had the eggplant wrap - too dry and cold. taste was also awful and again pricey . Simply can't visit again for quick lunch"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for a little while now - maybe 10-15 times.  I don't know about others' experiences, but it's been difficult for me to find healthy food in Charlotte.  You want a hot dog with chili or a burger with pimento cheese, throw a rock in any direction and you're in Heartburn City.  That's why I was stoked to find what appears to be a healthy alternative to fried foods.  After trying several items on the menu, most where meh, some were decent.  I found one I could eat fairly often and it's relatively healthy, so chicken churri sandwich with avocado it is.  Sometimes this is better than others, but typically it's been decent.  However, today I received a sandwich wrapped tightly in a takeout bag, only to return to my office (10 min. walk) to discover the avocado is black.  For those of you not from Avocado Country, they're supposed to be green, not black inside - apparently Energy Café employees have never visited Avocado Country.    I'm not talking about a little oxidation.  Being from Southern California, it's rare to go a couple of days without having avocado.  A little citric acid fixes that and makes the avocado tasty - helpful tip.  Check out the photo - that's a fair bit more than just a little browning due to oxidation.  This was rotten when it was added to my sandwich.  Now, if I was eating in the store (which they knew I was not because I placed a takeout order) I might not be as upset.  I could have walked up to the counter, asked for another one, and voila - problem solved.  No.  They tucked it away inside the sando, inside a wrapper around the sandwich, with another wrapper around that wrapper, then tucked away inside a bag.  I am not in the habit (though maybe I should be) of dismantling my meals while standing in the takeout line to see if they F'd it up.   The problem is: 10 mins to walk there, 5-10 minute wait, 10 minutes to walk back = 25-30 minutes and I still have no food (which I paid for).  Now I have to walk back (10 mins), argue with the manager to get my money back (5-10 mins), find food from another restaurant (10-15 mins) then walk back to my office again (10 mins).  So in addition to the 30 mins to get a rotten sandwich, I had to spend another 40 mins fixing it.  BE WARY OF TAKEOUT ORDERS AND ROTTEN FOOD - CHECK ALL OF  YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE"}
{"text":"The staff is the friendliest, the food is great and super healthy, they list the macros of each food choice on their website, and everything is super customizable. Healthy and easy--love this place"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. I rode my bike by and had to stop in and grab a kombucha drink and pick up a menu. They had the craziest awesome assortment of cold press coffees and kambucha so I stood there for like 5 minutes trying to decide what to grab. Then I came in for a poke bowl and asked them to make whatever they would order and it was BOMB. The burgers looked so good I think I could even get my BF to join me. None the less, everything from the smoothies to the chili looks bomb and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they can't update their paper menu or even their digital menu on site! We've went for their homemade energy bars and yogurt, both of which are on the menu still but are no longer carried."}
{"text":"They food is good. It's like a deli style where you can choose your toppings. They offer sides like a fruit cup and hummus. They offer gluten free bread. The last time I went the bread must have been stale. As soon as I cut into the sandwich the bread fell apart."}
{"text":"i walk by this place every day to get a quarter pounder extra value meal.  but today i was overcome with the spirit of yelp and fingered i would duck in real quick to grab some lunch. the decor of the joint makes you feel all futuristic as everything that isn't pure white is brightly colored.  this includes a nine by nine randomly colored lighting square mounted on the wall that i swear was sending me subliminal messages about eating like shit. to the average can/box/bag/take-out diner like myself, the menu can be a little confusing.  especially if you do not remember your daily intake pyramid from health class.  a protein?  yes, i think i want a protein.  what's a protein?  oh, chicken?  yeah, i like chicken, cool. much like any place that serves sandwiches,  there was a chicken salad sandwich on the menu.  that stuck out amongst the healthy buzz words like power, feul, and energy (approriate that it is located in the duke energy building). the staff on the sandwich/wrap/salad assembly line was nice enough.  not a whole lot of chit chat.  so, i had my chicken salad sandwich with romaine lettuce, (actually very succulent) tomato slices, walnuts, and cranberries on a whole grain oat roll with a bag of sun chips and washed it down with a steaz raspberry sparkling green tea (which seems to be a re-branded mystic cooler).  the \"combo\" ran me $10.02.  apparently healthy costs more. i grabbed a menu to go and if i go on a few hikes, take in a yoga class, and take a class at CPCC on health-nutanese, i may decipher it to return for another decent lunch.  assuming i still don't have nuts and whole grains stuck in my teeth from this visit."}
{"text":"I find Energy Cafe's lunch to be very bland. I work close by & was hopeful but I am disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this place only one star, but the atmosphere is nice, and it is an ok place to get a cup of coffee. But the lunches and service are sub par. It is the only place in Charlotte where I declined the food during its prep... and walked out.   The cafe has three problems.   First, food proportions are too small for the price. I understand that as a health food place, their emphasis is on counting calories. But that doesn't mean ripping off the customer. Prices are around $7-8 per sandwich before tax. But the meal leaves you unsatiated. I'm an active guy who wants healthy food options. But even their \"protein-packed\" Arnold sandwich is too skimpy for the price.   Second, the service stinks. The manager is positive and professional, but he unfortunately manages a crew that doesn't care and does not seem to know how to prepare the food properly. Their attitude is aloof, almost dead. They strike me as people completing some mandated hours of community service as opposed to preparing an appetizing meal.   Third, the food itself just isn't good. The sandwich that caused me to walk out was something called ChickCheese or Chicken Cheese. It was a handful of lettuce tossed on a small, 8-inch dry tortilla, with gray chicken (perhaps 1/4 cup proportion), and a mysterious white, clumpy sauce. It looked foul (no pun intended). It reminded me of the remnants of something I might dig out of the back of my fridge.  As an alternative to Energy Cafe, I recommend the Sandwich Club over in the Green."}
{"text":"Have to confess that I've walked by here a dozen times and never stopped in - BIG MISTAKE!  I was in the area anyway for a meeting and needed to grab lunch so I took a chance. . .turns out this place is great! Menu is a little confusing (lot of real estate devoted to shakes vs sandwiches, salads, etc). However, once you get the swing of it the menu makes sense. I ended up ordering a salad/sandwich combo: their greek salad and chicken salad on wheat. The salad was very fresh, with a low fat dressing and nice chunks of feta. The chicken salad was rock star - real chicken, light mayo, herbs, cranberries and walnuts. Awesome overall.  The combo came with a drink so I tried the ginger peach iced tea - again, great option and unique.   The total for all this was $7 bucks - a bargain for healthy, handmade food in Uptown. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a real fan....the breakfast wrap is really bland..I spice it up with hot sauce just to have taste.  It's all organic though, so its good for you...just not good!"}
{"text":"For a quick service lunch the energy café fits the bill.  While they do not appear to have gluten free options for the array of sandwiches and wraps, the signature salad did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have had a few options from here now for breakfast and lunch. It is good to see healthy food doesn't have to suck and can actually be tasty. It is also nice that they are in about the same price range as everything else in Uptown for lunch. I've had several menu items and like them all. I haven't been blown away by anything yet but when choice have to be made between good grease and healthy (non-salad), Energy Cafe makes it a little easier to choose the latter."}
{"text":"Great options for healthy lunchtime favorites. Free frozen yogurt while you wait, or after lunch! And small portions for great energy boosts.   - Hummus Sandwich - Side Protein - Chocolate frozen yogurt"}
{"text":"EnergyCafe is a great healthy alternative to the normal lunch fare.  I recently visited this restaurant on a business trip.  Conveniently located in the Bank of America building in the Uptown area of Charlotte, it focuses on healthy and delicious sandwiches, salads, wraps and smoothies.   I did not get a chance to try the smoothies, but the chicken salad sandwich I had was very flavorful and fabulously made.  The nutrional information is prominently displayed on the menus, allowing you to make wise decisions.  I believe all the meat is from the Boar's Head, which for my money is the best available.  Staff was very friendly and the line moved quickly.  I great place to get something healthy if you are ever in the Uptown area."}
{"text":"I have been to Energy Cafe's sister location near the Omni and was delighted to try this one out today.    Located in the breezeway between the Duke Energy Building and the Mint Museum, it is easy to find.  Parking may be tough - you have to be familiar with Uptown parking.  You can park on the street to get here or at the Green parking garage off Levine Ave.  The cafe itself is super trendy with white furniture, high tops and booths, trendy lighting and an open kitchen setting.  I branched out and got something new - the turkey and cheddar sandwich - toasted!  I am a wild woman.  The sandwich was big with turkey and cheddar, cucumbers, spinach greens, a hummus spread or something tasty to that effect.  YUM!!!!  It was very filling and super delis.  The folks that work behind the counter were very nice and friendly and quick.  Ask for a cup for water instead of getting a beverage and save a few bucks.  Great spot!  Will definitely be on my list for Uptown lunches :-D"}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week and it is very quick and healthy!  I got the Power Packed Chicken Salad sandwich - it is flavored with cranberries and has an overall mild flavor.  I got feta on mine and it makes it a little more interesting.  They move you quickly through the line and will yell at you if you do not approach the cash register fast enough - I was still answering questions of 'what do you want on it' when the cashier yelled 'Maam!' at me to come over and pay.  I am guessing he didnt realize they were still asking me what i wanted on my sandwich.  So that was odd but i think they are just trying to keep the line moving (I shot him a dirty look and he quieted down right away!)  The food is good and fast and HEALTHY!!!  Even my Nutritionist sister is a fan!!!"}
{"text":"There are few places around this side of town to grab a quick sandwich or salad, so many people flock to Energy Cafe. The food isn't bad, but it's not good. Everything tastes the same. Sure the food is healthy, but is it fresh? I don't know. It's also expensive!  My real qualm with this place is the service. I've called in twice to place a large order for a work meeting. I've given ample time and specified when I will be picking up the food. Both times, the cashier hasn't known about my order. The manager, who took my order over the phone, apologized and said he didn't put the order in. Instead of comping the meals or rushing the order, they continued to make everyone else's food first. I waited fifteen minutes and was late for the meeting. Bad service for a place in a massive office building!"}
{"text":"I will start out by saying I am not a health nut and was almost scared away by the protein bar display case (lol).  But I'm glad some friends said give it a try because it is really good! I appreciate a place trying to serve healhier lunch options - good sandwiches and great salads. I love the greek goddess salad, and it's nice to know you aren't eating your day's worth of calories in one meal! The prices are higher than most quickie lunch places, but hey it's good for you and you won't smell like grease afterwards! Defintely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My favorites are the Power House Salad and the Towering Turkey and Cheddar Sandwich. The house dressing is thick -- like a thick tangy hummus -- and quite good. The organic hummus and pita and organic quinoa salad are good side options. I wasn't impressed with the pumpkin walnut fuel bar though."}
{"text":"I love this place and I am a food snob. I'm pretty much here 3 or 4 times a week, mostly for lunch but sometimes breakfast. You get a great variety of quick, nutritious food in ample portions for a very reasonable price. Their mainstays are breakfast and lunch sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups. Sandwiches come on hearty grain bread, and they are generous with the guacamole. They even serve a delicious egg sandwich at lunch, which pairs well with their Tomato Basil bisque soup. Really hungry or just worked out? Order the massive Arnold wrap which comes with ample chicken and egg whites, mixed in with salad greens and other goodies.  Energy Cafe also does some interesting sides, like black-eyed pea hummus and quinoa salad. Of course, there is a great juice co-located inside the restaurant (Bank of America plaza, not sure about the Duke Energy location). In addition, they have a large variety of snacks and beverages, like Ostrich Jerky, protein bars, Lenny Boy Kombucha, and Izzy drinks.  The employees are very friendly, and the place has a friendly, lively vibe to it. To me, it feels great to support this locally owned and operated business.   On another note: I think Yelpers have been overly harsh on this place, which deserves much higher than it's current 3.5 stars. One person gave a 1 star review because the cashier didn't know the price of an up-charge. Another gave a 2 star because his Arnold wrap was too expensive at $8.50, which a) the Arnold is a huge high protein wrap and is the most expensive one and b) $8.50 isn't really all that much for an uptown lunch. In addition, some say the food is bland*. My guess is that those folks aren't accustomed to eating healthy food. The food here isn't dripping in butter, oil, salt, or sugar.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I have not been a huge fan of Energy Cafe in the times that I have gone. Most of my selections have been disappointing.  Keep in mind there are no cooktops here, only microwaves and toaster ovens , so that says a lot right there. Today I decided to give it another shot and try the traditional American breakfast since it was just $4.99. What I received was hardly worth $4.99 and should have been priced about $2 cheaper. Microwaved eggs (of course) , 3 pieces of turkey bacon which I saw the woman reheat in the microwave also and 1 slice - ONE slice of toast that was cut in half. For that price I can't even get two slices of toast? Against my better judgement I chose this place for breakfast today, but it will be the last time."}
{"text":"Place is clean, people are nice, decor is contemporary, and the protein shake was pretty good - it was exactly what I was looking for.   As for the negative, I am not sure I would ever eat food here given the filthy condition of the 3 panini machines. See photo."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say I can no longer recommend Energy Cafe in the Plaza Building uptown. I've noticed a significant decline in the service and the food quality over the past year. Portions seem to be smaller. Prices seem to be higher. It's not uncommon for them to be out of ingredients. But the final straw was last week when my pumpkin walnut bar was covered in mold. I was beyond disgusted & disappointed, as was my husband, since it was his suggestion to meet here for lunch despite my objections. While the cashier was apologetic & offered me a new option, I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally find an uptown lunch spot that focuses on honest health instead of hiding behind vague menu descriptions and health information from the 1980s, like so many others.  This place really impresses me with their commitment to healthy, natural ingredients. Overall, I think the food is very good, and the menu options are as extensive as they need to be to make this a weekly lunch stop.  However, I have one issue with the price point, particularly with breakfast.  The cost of a breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous for what you actually get.  For $5, i don't expect someone to reach into a steamer and pull out a 2 hour old poached egg, place it on a stale wrap, and throw a pinch of turkey bacon on it and call it a decent breakfast. In contrast though, the lunch is spectacular.  You definitely get a decent bang for the buck, especially if you eat in (tea refills and complimentary froyo).  In my experiences, it always tastes fresh, healthy, and delicious... and I'm actually somewhat full afterward.  For breakfast this place gets 2 stars, but for lunch it gets 4.  So an overall 3 it is."}
{"text":"The food here is simple and easy. Wide assortment of wraps and sandwiches as well as healthy bars and cookies to bring back with you to the office for that 3pm snack. The part that's great about this place is the fact that all the important nutrition information is written on the menu. Most of the sandwiches and wraps average 500 cals and are under 15grams of fat. Takes the stress out of finding a healthy lunch routine. I didn't vote more than 3 stars because the location is kind of sterile (not really their fault) and they don't mention if their menu is organic."}
{"text":"The place looks cool and the people were nice. Now let me get to what actually matters in this review... the food. I stopped in for bfast and got the \"protein bowl\"... well it sucked, it came w 2 egg whites, veggies and choice of meat, i got turkey sausage. I also added onions, jalapenos, and red peppers. The below picture describes the attempt to make this tiny carton full by putting in a handful of jalapenos and onions on top of 1 sausage patty and about 4 bites of egg whites. Of the ~6 bites i had (i ate all of it) 4 of them were scoops fulls of veggies bc the meat was gone, it was gross and overpriced. While i did ask for the veggies, I will not be back as that was the lamest attempt at a breakfast bowl i have ever seen. This with a coffee was ~$7"}
{"text":"Power Packed Chicken Salad on a low-carb wheat wrap.....add spinach, cranberries, almonds, and Sriracha sauce.  I have this almost every day."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and reasonably priced for uptown Charlotte.  Energy cafe has a rewards program which is an added perk!  They post their nutritional information which is a benefit for people that are counting calories or who have dietary restrictions.  The ingredients are fresh and usually your food is ready very fast, which makes it convenient for those in a hurry at lunch time.    I love the southwestern superfoods salad.  It is delicious and low calorie.  I always add chicken to make it more filling.    Make sure you check your food before leaving.  I have had a couple of mix ups there but they have always made it right."}
{"text":"Mmmm hmmm healthy schmealthy food...and, hey, it's really tasty!   I finally got a chance to check out Energy Cafe's new location in the Duke Energy building and I was really impressed! Not only was the food super fresh and delicious, but the ambiance is clean and inviting and the employees smiley and helpful.   I ordered the Power Packed Chicken Salad sandwich - roasted chicken, low-fat mayo, dried cranberries and nuts on multigrain bread. Not only did it fill me up, but this healthy sammie packed a punch! The flavors were great, bright and perfect for a healthy lunch. I ordered a combo with my meal and scored some cheddar potato Popchips (this is the first place I've seen them in Charlotte!) and an iced tea. Their decaf detox tea is delicious, too - nice and refreshing! Plus, their menu lists the nutrition content which I really respect.   My combo came to just under $10 when all was said and done. Price wise, it's a bit more than other sandwich locales, but the organic ingredients and nutritious outlook is worth a few bucks more to me.   I also noticed that they have teeny little cups for free froyo if you purchase a combo. Yesterday's flavor was pistachio - and while I didn't have any, it looked froyolicious. In terms of a healthy, flavor packed meal in Uptown - Energy Cafe is the one of the best of the best fo shizzle."}
{"text":"Great place for a fresh, healthy sandwich or salad.  A bit pricier than other sandwich joints around, but worth it for the ingredients.  I'm a huge fan of their hummus and veggie sandwich, and it's one of the only places around to get just a plain 'ol hummus and veggie sammich!  Salads are great, decent portions for the price.  Soups are also super yummy!  (BONUS: they have sriracha sauce out on the condiment table most of the time - AWESOME!)  Their iced tea is fresh and delightful, and they also offer quinoa salad as a side - EXCELLENT!  This is always my first choice of mine when I'm looking for something light and healthy!"}
{"text":"I went in this morning to order a Morning Fuel smoothie. I have had decent smoothies here before, but the one I received this morning was undrinkable. It was pretty apparent that the gentleman helping me was new, yet no one was assisting him. The drink came out like cold watery coffee and had no sweetness at all when one of the ingredients is ice cream. I think an ingredient must have been forgotten. I am not a picky eater or tough customer, but I threw this $6 smoothie in the trash after one sip despite being pretty hungry. This smoothie has the option of non fat milk or soy milk, but I was not asked which one I wanted. I understand that this could be my responsibility to ask for, but this morning I forgot to ask and I'm lactose intolerant. I didn't remember until I saw him pouring milk in. I am so disappointed.   I have always been corrected about the size of the drink I'm ordering. There are two smoothie sizes, but they are not labeled S/M or M/L. Whenever I order \"the smaller one\" aka, the cheaper one, I'm corrected and told that it's a Medium. I don't know what cup sizes those prices represent and I don't care, but if it's essential to ordering then they need to be labeled.   Another thing I've observed is that this restaurant always smells like something burning. I think the panini machines need to be cleaned because it's not very appetizing.   I won't be back, and it's a shame that this place is so mediocre because it is very convenient to where I work in the Duke Energy building. I'll walk a few blocks to get something tasty for less money."}
{"text":"I just started working in uptown and thought it was time to explore. I sincerely regret my decision. The girl who took my order was rude from the first word. Process-wise, if I want a smoothie and a sandwich... why do I order one item from her and one from another man across the restaurant? It doesn't make any sense. So I dropped the smoothie idea. Apparently its a big deal. So they're out of roasted peppers and regular peppers. No biggie. I asked what my other options are. The chick points at the prep table and says, you can pick from these. What? Points? Can you not verbally tell me?   So then I go to pay and I ask for the combo. He asks me what kind of drink I want. I asked him what my choices are, because the menu lists tea as my only option. He lists off bottled water and another bottled beverage. I pick the water and my total is $10.05. If the combo is $8.79...where is the big difference in price? His response? \"I don't know, thats just what it is. If you want to talk to a manager, he's right there\"   After speaking to the manager...he explained that the water was an up charge of 50 cents. I don't mind paying 50 cents....I do mind being told I don't know why your bill is higher than expected, but that's what it is....with no apologies or explanation.    Rude awful customer service start to finish. They get 1 star because the wrap I got wasn't half bad."}
{"text":"When there were only two other people in line, and one person dining in I should have known it was just OK. The service was very slow, somewhat rude, and the turkey wrap was nothing to write home about. Not my 1st choice when it comes to a turkey wrap. Will pass next time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Energy Cafe Signature Salad with chicken.  It was delicious with the dressing provided and filling as well.  It's always good when you can grab a quick, fresh salad that is made just for you.    Although I did not try one of the Power Wrap sandwiches, I observed that they are packed and well worth the price.  I went back after 4 pm but they closed at 3 pm.  I look forward to going back when hunger is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices for wraps, sandwiches and salads made with wholesome ingredients. Think guac, sprouts, hummus for handheld meals, and walnuts, cranberries and chickpeas for the salads with raspberry dressing.   My favorite sandwiches include the Arnold or, the Southwestern Turkey wrap. Salads are great too!  Most everything is under $10.  Also props on the free frozen yogurt cups while you wait or for dessert!  There are usually good flavors including salted Carmel, pistachio or NY style cheesecake.   I mostly do takeout since this location is adjacent to my office downtown; however the atmosphere inside is pretty good for uptown eateries. They usually have trendy music playing at an appropriate volume and the chairs/tables are a hip stainless steel.    Note - this review does not cover the juice bar inside."}
{"text":"Energy Cafe is a great spot for healthy food quick. They have quite a variety of sandwiches and wraps that come with great ingredients like avocado, turkey bacon or egg whites. My favorite is the Arnold wrap which include with chicken and egg whites.   The salads are also delicious. They can make one special but the preset ones have a lot on them and taste great. I prefer the Signature Salad, which include chicken, nuts, apples, oranges and a great raspberry dressing.   The place was renovated in 2014 and has a great industrial chic look. Think concrete floors, exposed ceilings and sleek aluminum chairs and tables. They usually have great upbeat music playing as well.   They have recently opened a juice / smoothie bar inside as well. I've only had the samples but looks good and have heard good things from co workers who have traveled in."}
{"text":"Energy cafe is something like a Pinkberry for salads. Funky, contemporary, art deco ala George Jetson kinda decor.   I kinda feel like a fool 'cause on my last visit, the gentleman assisting me wrote my name, real name on my salad (btw the house salad is pretty scrumptious). I didn't even tell the dude my name, but he spelled it out entirely and correctly on the box. I was like, \"dude, whoa\".   Initially, I thought I was like a celebrity or Yelp star or something. It wasn't until I got back in the office and saw my badge hanging from my belt that I realized, I'm just another Joe Schome with my face on a name tag."}
{"text":"Eat healthy tasty food here!  This fast casual restaurant is located in the Bank of America Plaza, just down the escalators from the Omni Hotel lobby and below the Charlotte Athletic Club (you won't be able to see this restaurant from the street-- it's inside).  I stopped here because they market their dishes as being organic, fresh whole foods made to power a body in motion.  I loved the fact they listed all the micro nutrients for each of their dishes on the menu (protein, fat, carbs, fiber in addition to total calories).  They have smoothies, healthy breakfast items, salads and lunch sandwiches and wraps.  Smooth coffee and iced tea too!  I had the Egg Delight Sandwich which is made to order and is filled with power foods such as egg whites, organic guacamole, tomatoes and turkey bacon on a multigrain bread of substance (31g of protein).  It was good, but could use a little kick with some hot sauce.  I would definitely come back for a post workout meal, breakfast or a muscle building lunch.    Sit and drink your fair trade coffee, while enjoying the free wifi while you people watch all the folks standing in the long line at the Starbucks kiosk across the hallway during the morning rush."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and vegan options. Quick, convenient, and friendly staff. The vegan , gluten-free, sugar-free raspberry tart was amazing!"}
