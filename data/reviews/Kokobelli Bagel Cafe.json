{"text":"Definitely the best bagel in the valley.  They have great lunch sandwiches as well.  They bake their bagels fresh all day long and have a ton of awesome flavored cream cheeses that are all made there too.  This place is a must if you want a great bagel!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and always loved it.  Recently there have been changes for the worst.  Bagel recipe has changed, while still good, they are no longer great.  My biggest complaint is the change in the drink sizes.  Their \"large\" drink is about half the size it used to be and the price is the same.  I often take my order to go and the price is way too expensive.  I have definitely cut back on how often I go here."}
{"text":"Love this place, good bagel... only down fall is they run out of plain bagel sometime. Definitely has a small town feel."}
{"text":"Cute, family owned, and reasonably priced! My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our bagels, I got a mocha chip frozen coffee drink that was great as well. There is plenty of seating and a nice outdoor patio. Overall a good breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"Love this place, we go every other weekend for breakfast and enjoy the bagel sandwiches, mochas, juice. I always order the sunrise on an everything-delicious! The bagels are large, fresh, fluffy, and tasty. The service is great, and this is a comfortable, neighborhood type place to relax and enjoy with family or friends."}
{"text":"The most delicious lox I ever tasted, and the bagel tasted like they made it after I walked in the door. Delicious! Wish they had a Facebook page."}
{"text":"Quick, easy menu, delicious bagels! Breakfast sandwiches are great. Recommend sunrise with bacon on cheddar bagel! They even throw in a mini muffin with each sandwich. Splurge on espresso coffee cause their regular coffee isnt as strong as id like."}
{"text":"Service- it was slow and unorganized. We were not acknowledged when we came in and the girl at the cashier seemed very stressed. They forgot my smoothie, and ended up giving me a large because they felt bad (which was nice).

Food- I ordered the sunrise. The bagel was ok, but the egg was terrible. I'm pretty sure it wasn't real eggs used because it was just thin and flat. The sandwich lacked flavor. The smoothie was fake as well. Definitely made with powder and not real fruit. My boyfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich. The bread wasn't good, he couldn't taste the chicken, and the vegetables seemed dead."}
{"text":"Nice folks. Good food and coffee. Place is clean.  Prices are reasonable. I'll remember them next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The bagels are delicious!!! The breakfast sandwiches are okay. They use the products that come pre-made and frozen like Dunkin' Donuts. What made up for that was the mini muffin that came with it. I ordered a latte also, I wouldn't recommend it. The steamer was left in the milk until it turned off on its own, you should steam milk at different levels for the proper texture and foam. I opened the cup and there was no foam whatsoever. The shining star here is the bagel, I will definitely come back for a bakers dozen (5.99)."}
{"text":"I really like this place, good bagels good service! BAD cafe mocha! I will stick to Starbucks for that!"}
{"text":"Very delicious bagels. Just moved to Arizona and I can say that I will be back for sure. Best ham and cheese breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"I always order the Sunrise with a cheddar bagel, egg, bacon and jalapeno cream cheese.  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"Bready bagels, not real bagels. Egg sandwich is terrible!  The egg tasted like dishwater!

This place make's Einstien's Bagels seem like geniuses!  And I'm no fan of chain-store bagels.

Stick with Chompies or Back East Bagels in Tempe for something more bagel-like, and a good breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Az. My dad recently sent me bagels from back east because he didn't know about this place and there was very little difference. I have been going here for years and will continue to do so. Great deals on half dozen and dozen packages with cream cheese."}
{"text":"Wow ... what a poor first impression!  As soon as I pulled up I saw an older female employee aggressively locking up the patio furniture to prevent anyone from sitting out there. I arrived at 1:15 and they close at 2pm. Walked in and ordered a sandwich to go ... because I sure did NOT feel comfortable eating it there!  As I waited for my food, the same woman proceeded to mop the floors, sweep, and break down the coffee and tea dispensers. As a person who has bar and restaurant experience on my resume, I can tell you my former managers would have blanched at the blatant disregard for customer consideration!  The girl who took my order and gave me my food was polite and friendly. The sandwich was good, but certainly did not make up for the white witch and her broomstick sweeping me out the door!  I will seriously consider not returning."}
{"text":"The best bagel shop in Mesa hands down. I've been going there for almost a decade and I have never been let down."}
{"text":"I have had patients bring in Kokobelli's amazing bagels as treats for the staff and Banner Baywood and I knew I had to try th cafe myself. I had the sunrise breakfast bagel with a vanilla latte. Enjoyed my delicious breakfast on the patio!"}
{"text":"Bagels are awesome!! Staff is great. Salads, not so much :( The lettuce was all brown, slimey & wilted under the chicken that was placed on top. Very disappointed especially since I spent $9 on a salad & drink & couldnt even eat the salad. Everything else there is great, I guess they should stick to what they know"}
{"text":"Great job!!! If your looking for a great bagel sandwich look no further. I truly like this place. Iv tried other bagel places but no other has the back east taste like kokopelli. They are very very busy in the morning so you might have a few minute wait but they say sorry for waiting which for me that's great service. Iv read other reviews that complain but iv been here plenty of times and have always had a consistent great experience. I like my eggs scrambled with cheese and they do it for me every time without charging extra. Thank you. This place is a great start for your day."}
{"text":"I have had the same experience of many of the other recent reviewers.  My impression of Kokobelli started at a 5. There were great bagels, great sandwiches, and adequate customer service.  

Over the past year the sandwiches have gotten smaller.  The customer service has become terrible.  They mess up orders.  I keep coming back, hoping that the last experience was an outlier.  I finally have to conclude that this place just isn't that great anymore. 

Kokobelli, pull it together.  Hire a new manager.  Get some staff that give a shit.  I want to support a local business but you are making it impossible.  Until I see \"Under new management\" hanging outside, I don't think I will be back.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"I think these guys need to change their name to \"Bagel and Sandwich Cafe\". I don't understand why all the reviews written so far are only for the bagels when their sandwiches are awesome!

I've eaten here twice now, and only had the sandwiches, but they are soooo good. Hearty, filling, great quality ingredients, and while not cheap, prices are comparable to, say Paradise Bakery, without the fuss and with some freebies. If I want cheap, I'll eat off the dollar menu at McDonalds or something. 

So far I've had the chicken cashew salad sandwhich (cold), and the roast beef with red pepper something (jam?) panini (hot). 

The chicken salad is a refreshing mix of chopped crispy veggies and tasty chicken in some kind of dill mayo dressing. I don't know if there's a little yogurt added to the dressing, it didn't taste like just mayo and was itself very flavorful. The sandwich bread is a hearty focaccia which tastes like it could be fresh baked, but I'm not sure if it is. It's certainly better than store bought focaccia and most other sandwich places I've had. 

The roast beef was very tender, delicious. The red pepper was a little understated...it wasn't large pieces of roasted red pepper, which is what I was looking for, but something more like a caramelized red pepper and onion jam. Even though it wasn't what I was hoping for, it was still very good and not a reason for complaint at all. The bread was crispy in all right places....oh.....sooo goood! The portion of sandwich filling is generous in both...while not New York deli portions, still more than enough to satisfy.

The sandwiches are served w/ bagel chips instead of potato chips. These might sound healthier, but probably have a lot more calories, but taste so much better as they're soaked in butter and seasonings. I also got a strawberry banana yogurt smoothie which was excellent and you could really taste the fruit and yogurt. Somehow, getting the sandwich, and I think any kind of drink, is considered getting a lunch special, so they'll throw in a dessert for free! I've had the brownie and crumb cake. They were both delicious...moist and tasted freshly baked, even though I doubt they were. 

Anyways, I doubt I'll ever actually get a bagel here, but if I'm in the mood for a satisfying lunch, this will be a go to place."}
{"text":"I came in here after finding them on Yelp. I wanted something different from fastfood breakfast. So I came here with my son and we got the special. half dozen bagels with half pound cream cheese $8.99. Was Really Good, My Favorite is the French Toast bagel. The Asagio was spot on too. The Garlic Bagel was a bit too salty for me to handle. My Wife liked it, I guess I am just sensitive to salty.lol But not only they had good bagels, but the customer service was Great. The guy at the counter was friendly and helpful. I will guarantee come back again, maybe next saturday, I wanna try there other cream cheese's. They also sell soup and sandwhich's and other pastries. 
The Restaurant was clean and it wasn't crowded.Smelled wonderful with all bagels cooking."}
{"text":"Love this place for bagels and coffee. Today I tried the turkey avocado on a toasted jalapeño bagel and it was delish."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is nice and food is simple but yummy. Have never had anything i didn't like. Wait is never too long. Breakfast bagel sandwiches are my favorite here."}
{"text":"NUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! More than just bagels! My family and I enjoyed amazing breakfast sandwiches and splurged on some chocolate eclairs! So good!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is pretty legit.  Not fancy, but g-damn, the bagels are good.  Plus, the prepared bagels (I got the lox bagel) are pretty amazeballs.  I'm glad I impulse-bought a bunch of swiss cheese bagels while I was there.  Amazing.  This is your one-stop carb-shopping paradise.  Get 'er done."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great bagels and sandwiches and they are always quick as I frequent here for lunch while at work."}
{"text":"BEWARE: THIS IS NOT A BREAKFAST RESTAURANT LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAYS, IT'S A SANDWICH PLACE ONLY! You'll need to eat two sandwiches if you're from NYC as the framed wall photos imply the owners are from. The Sunrise with Meat was delicious, but needed a sauce and was sparse on egg & bacon. $4.99 was expensive for what you got. No way is this the #2 breakfast place in Mesa on Yelp!

Now, my dining partner's Turkey Avocado Croissant was delicious and full of turkey and avocado. Great mayo & cream cheese sauce. Price at $7.99 was cheap for what you got.

Eat here for lunch, avoid for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this local bagel shop! Both sweet and savory bagels are amazing, and if you do get the sunrise bagel sandwich, might I suggest subbing a blueberry bagel for the onion... trust me. Also, can't beat the 1/2 dozen day old bagels at $1.99! Just have to get there early!"}
{"text":"Would love to buy this place.  It is very inconsistent with the food, has cleanliness issues in the dining room and bathroom.

I often order my sandwich on a bagel.  Its 50/50 that it is made that way.  Would love to get what I order and pay for.

This place needs a deep cleaning and then have a cleaning schedule put together.  But things are more simple than that.  Today there was part of newspaper laying on the floor and one of the employees stepped over the paper to walk behind the counter.  She had to actually step over the papers in order to get behind the counter.  She couldn't simply bend down and pick up the papers?

I would love to buy this place and fix it."}
{"text":"These bagels are definitely better than any corporation bagel shop. Family owned and operated. It was delightful. We both got the spirited kokobelli, it had the right amount of toppings. Delicious iced coffee and an added bonus with the hazelnut and vanilla flavored coffee! Everyone there had wonderful customer relation skills. I'll be back to try some of their sandwiches, because they all sound so good."}
{"text":"The lox sandwich was DELICOUS. Cream cheese, soft, fresh bagels, lightly toasted, tomatoes, capers and onions. And the older lady working the counter was the sweetest lady ever! I will be back"}
{"text":"Was there a few years ago- I am not sure if the owners are still the same? The highlights are its reasonably priced, great food! the low is how long it took to get food- we were the only people in the place! took over 25 mins for quick bite to eat for two-
I will go back soon and write an updated review also-"}
{"text":"This is our favorite bagel place in the East Valley. They have great customer service, insanely delicous bagels, unique sandwiches, and incredible coffee. My husband and I come here at least once a week and it's always fun trying new bagels and cream cheese flavors. The Bacon Scallion Cream Cheese is out of this world. We're proud to be regulars of such a wonderful place."}
{"text":"Second trip.. I had sunup on everything begal and tge wife had the cinnamon crunch begal with pumpkin cream cheese 
 Both were very good! Service again was top notch."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened. While the food is still good, the service has gotten horrible. Especially the lady at the counter, I believe her name is Sarah. She is slow, rude, and frequently overcharges for things because she doesn't know how to work the POS system. This last time, she actually charged me 50 cents for extra mayonnaise for my sandwich because there was so little put on in the first place. In my 46 years on earth, mostly eating out every day, I've never paid extra for mayo!  When I asked her why, she told me mayo costs us money and therefore we charge for it.  She is by far the most incompetent employee I have seen in this place and I've literally been here hundreds of times. Don't know if I will come back because of her which is a shame because I really like their food."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday (4/7/18) as we were in the area shopping.  My wife got a westerner and I had an everything Bagel with cream cheese.  My wife and I both got sick and have had issues for a full day now.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bagel joint. I've always had delicious bagels and cream cheese here. Got the lox bagel sandwich once and while it was a lot pricier than I expected it was amazing!! As always you get the little muffin with all sandwich orders."}
{"text":"I have to admit my everything bagel was very tasty and the garlic on top was a nice touch. I went in there hoping they sold cookies too, they didn't. Disappointed. I would give 4 stars but I was EXTREMELY turned off by the cashiers who spent all of 30 seconds taking your order putting people on the spot to tip them. The tip cup with the sign begging for tips is good enough. For someone who put themself through college busting their a$$ waiting tables, it's unbelievable they are asking everyone who pays with their credit card to tip them. Wow. Get a new credit card system that has a tip line, which is also annoying but better than the current process."}
{"text":"Tiny little bagel place. I have to say the prices are fair, bagels are huge, and the orange juice was fresh. The staff were not friendly..I get it..it's a Sunday and no one wants to be working. However, it was my first time in and probably my last. My bagels were not even toasted like I asked. I didn't bother telling the staff, because by the time my bagel actually made it to me with cream cheese, I was starving. There weren't even a lot of people in the shop. The flavors of cream cheese are interesting and different. I just feel like there are other bagel places I can go to if I'm really craving one again that won't take so long and will provide better customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a bagel and cup of coffee. I have been going there for years. It is a pleasure to be greeted by name. Keep up the Great job."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this place at least 4 times a month. I have never been a big bagel fan because I was raised in a Filipino household and for breakfast we have some kind of meat, rice and eggs. My wife however was raised in a traditional Caucasian household. She had bagels and toast and waffles and pancakes for breakfast. Due to our different backgrounds its usually difficult for us to find a place for breakfast that we both like equally. Let me tell you, eating Kokobellis makes me wish I grew up White. The bagels are so big that they won't fit in your average household toaster, but that doesn't take away at all from the quality and taste. They have the biggest bagels with the biggest flavor. I believe they have close to 20 different bagel choices and around 15 smear options. 
Their cream cheese isn't like Einstein Bagels at all. Meaning, if its flavored like strawberry or salmon, it just doesn't taste like those things miraculously. Yes, Einsteins smear is good but don't you wonder how the strawberry tastes like strawberry? How does the Salmon cream cheese taste like salmon? Is it artificial? Maybe. I'm not sure. 
I do know that at Kokobelli, their cream cheese is mixed with the very ingredients that they're named after. The salmon smear has pieces of lox in it. AMAZING! Their Bacon and Scallion cream cheese has pieces of bacon and you guessed it...scallions. So good.
On top of their delicious bagels and smear, they have breakfast sandwiches that will make you want to roundhouse kick yourself in the face. Thats a good thing.
Pick your bagel of choice, throw on an egg, sausage and some cheese? Fughet about it! Every bagel sandwich comes with a little pastry. Its a nice little surprise and my wife appreciates it a lot. 
Bottom line people, if you are looking for a great bagel place with quality ingredients and upstanding customer service...look no further, Kokobelli Bagel Cafe should be your next stop. 
I don't give out 5 stars often, but this place deserves it. It is hands down, the best bagel shop in Mesa, maybe Phoenix. It kicks Einstein out of the water and Chompies might be a more complete breakfast eatery, but Kokobelli still has better bagels."}
{"text":"I come from back east (New York City), which is pretty much acknowledged as having the best pizza and bagels. Something to do with the water, they say. When I found Kokopelli Bagels in Mesa several years ago, I was delighted to discover that, with or without the \"special water\", the bagels were excellent. Unfortunately, however, the quality of their bagels, and their customer service as well, has gone steadily downward over the past year or so, such that I no longer think of them as rivaling the bagels in New York City, but just another \"run of the mill\" bagel place in the East Valley. The bagels simply lack the flavor and taste that originally attracted me. A perfect example of the problem is evident in their cinnamon raison bagel. Not only does it lack the ingredients for which it is named (there are few, sometimes no raisons, and the cinnamon can't be tasted) but the taste and flavor of the bagel itself is sorely lacking. There are large air pockets and empty spaces in the bagel, which become apparent when the bagel is cut. Other bagel types also suffer from this same lack of baking technique. To add insult to injury, they no longer seem to calculate the type and amount of bagels to bake so as not to run out before noon. In my opinion, Kokopelli has become a disappointment and I will remove it from my short list of better East Valley restaurants/food purveyors."}
{"text":"Bagels are top notch! Best when toasted! Plump and moist not dry and flat. Super fresh each morning totally incredible and worth a drive for these bagels. Their inside seating area is nice, no smiles from the back staff (food prep etc.) but the cashiers super friendly and makes up for it. They have several different kinds of bagels( you can buy one or a dozen )and cream cheese, muffins, pastries, Iced Coffees and Smoothies too. Open for breakfast and lunch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bagels I've ever had! The everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese and ham toasted is amazing. Also they sometimes have a jalepeno cheddar bagel that will knock your socks off. The BEST in the valley."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot but i started getting mentally exhausted of this place. Don't get me wrong- the food is pretty damn good. The fresh made bagels are really good- just a tad overpriced.Race about 2-4 angry old people to the front door, pay an extra 3$ for skimped meat on my egg bagel, wait 20 minutes for it, and half the time got the wrong order. Just ate it anyways."}
{"text":"Amazing bagel sandwiches, and the employees are super helpful! Especially Mrs Marcheski, they always do a great job for us."}
{"text":"there are very few bagel places out in mesa, other than a couple of einstein's (not a big fan although their cream cheese is delish). kokobelli is a complete gem. i think their bagels are better than chompies because they have personality! chompies bagels are technically superior, but honestly i feel they're a little boring! 

kokobelli has more exciting flavors like asiago, cinnamon crunch and french toast. they also have a baker's choice bagel of the day. today's bagel was jalapeno pepperjack. i ordered it toasted with veggie cream cheese, and it was the BEST BAGEL OF MY LIFE. it was sweet, spicy, chewy, doughy and crispy all at the same time! i've had some amazing, authentic bagels back east, but this one takes the cake.

i'm sitting here wondering if they're still open, so i can pick up a few to take home. yummmmm!"}
{"text":"I had a Spirited Kokobelli's which comes on a jalapeño  bagel with Sausage, Egg, jack cheese and Pico de gallo. It's a great taste and I loved it with a large coffee. My bill was $7.11. 

When you order a bagel sandwich  they also give you a mini blueberry muffin."}
{"text":"This is such a good breakfast place. My favorite is the lox sandwich. It is super tasty and it is a generous portion. It comes with a sweet treat to clean the palate after the savory bagel. Sometimes I buy the half dozen bagels and small jar of their cream cheese which I really recommend."}
{"text":"This used to be the best bagel shop anywhere. Unfortunately it has gone down hill to I'm guessing possible new ownership or simply just cutting corners on quality. The everything bagel used to be covered on top and inside the dough with all the tastes you buy it for, the one I just got tasted like a piece of French bread with sprinkled flavor on it, terrible, especially knowing how good it used to be. My kids didn't even finish their bagels, which is unusual, they said theirs had no taste and didn't want it. Very disappointed, I'll be looking for a new bagel shop that at least cares about their product."}
{"text":"Best bagel sandwich in town!  I love supporting local businesses, although the local bagel place (not associated with Kokobellis) that is closer to my house has rather disappointing bagels and even more disappointing bagel sandwiches. So when I stopped into Kokobelli I was excited to have found a local bagel place with a delicious selection.  Staff was attentive and my bagel was the perfect mix of soft, chewy, and crispy toasty.  The sandwich was delicious although I will forewarn that the bacon seemed to be the pre-cooked microwavable type.  But personally that doesn't bother me.  The deli meats and cheeses and the sauces were great.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this place is absolutely my favorite! it's sooooo good i come here every time i'm in arizona ughhh yess"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff and even better food. A must try! My son had the French toast bagel with maple raisin walnut cream cheese and he said it was heaven!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great bagel selection and menu options. Ample seating inside and outside seating as well. Friendly staff and the place was quite busy for a weekend morning. You could definitely tell there were some local resident regulars there."}
{"text":"Great variety!  Friendly workers.   The only thing I would improve would be that they should get a bigger place. It's a little crowded in there.  Otherwise, delicious bagels."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place five stars. 

This place is hands down the best bagels I've had since moving from NY. Unfortunately it is usually impossible to buy a dozen there because they run out of bagels. It takes me around twenty minutes to drive there and it is very frustrating to arrive and find that the plain bin has only two left. I was told that the wait for more would be forty-five minutes. I can understand a food establishment running out of a certain product, but not when the product is in the title of the establishment. 

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation- great bagels! I love that they aren't too tough or hard they are huge too! Quite flavorful and very nice clerk and service."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast Cafe. The bagels are so scrumptious, soft and warm... And the cream cheese is hand made and to die for!!! Everyone should experience the brilliance that is Kokobelli Cafe."}
{"text":"The bagels are soooooo good! Had a bagel breakfast sandwich and it was sooooo good so I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great bagel shop with salt bagels! Sandwiches have great flavor but seemed a little thin to me. Try the bagel and lox!"}
{"text":"This will likely be my last visit here, it's continued to deteriorate. Got everything Bagel, and they were stale. The quality of both the Lox, and the Capers has deteriorated, and they've cut back on the Cream Cheese.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"I had to go to get a brake inspection at the Midas on the other end of the strip mall. They said it was going to be a 30 minute wait, so I decided to head over here grab a coffee and some breakfast. I walked in and there was no one at the counter, I stood at the cash register looked at the menu.  There was a pregnant girl leaning against the counter talking to another girl, Paying absolute zero attention to me. Roughly 2 minutes later, I realized that this customer wasn't going to get any service at this place and walked out.
How in the world can you guys stay open with shitty customer service? I know I'll never be back and I can only hope the people that read this will pass by you and not give you any of their business."}
{"text":"Have nothing but great things to say about the staff at Kokobelli bagels. They were crazy busy yesterday when I went in to get my lox sandwich. People in line were getting frustrated but the staff was amazing and they kept up with the orders and demands of their customers. #SnowbirdsAreBackInTown I got home and opened up my container and saw I had everything but my lox. I called them back and they said that I could come in today and they would refund my money and give me a lox sandwich for free. I went in and told them about yesterday. I told them that they are keeping my money and all I ask is for a lox sandwich. Their bagels are so good. If you are in Mesa, highly recommend this little mom and pop shop."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in Phoenix! They have the yummiest sandwiches, I love the sunrise breakfast sandwich. Great customer service also! So friendly and up beat!!"}
{"text":"I know they are not located in Brooklyn, NY but the taste of their bagels are really close to that of a New York one!  Thy make really good bagels; soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  They also have great flavored bagels, especially the orange-cranberry which my husband inquired about, but he was told they only made it seasonally!  The only two things I don't like about that place is that they close so early and their bagels get hard fast!!  I wish they stayed fresher, longer!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and quick service! Every sandwich we have gotten is tasty. Also I love that they have iced coffee."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite bagel place! They have the best bagels in town! They have several options to choose from and I have never been disappointed - I love them all. They have good coffee and great customer service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best deal in the Fiesta Mall for a meal. For 6.99 you get a whole sandwich off their menu of great choices, a side of pasta salad,potato salad or bagel chips, a drink  AND a choice of brownie , cookie or crumb cake. Actually there were more choices for the dessert but all I had to hear was crumbcake. All fresh and made on site. They are new to Fiesta Mall so make sure you come out and support them. They are family run and very nice. Stop by and see Freddie, he's very cool and will make sure you're happy!"}
{"text":"great place had the lox cream cheese capers onion tomato open face bagel,polite service, nice setting"}
{"text":"We always come here when we are in the hood, always great bagels and pastries. Today, I got a sweet bagel and apparently it was toasted after an onion bagel was in there. Yuck! Tasted horrible. Recommend either having a separate toaster for sweet and savory bagels. The cross flavors were horrible, I couldn't even finish it"}
{"text":"My husband picked up some breakfast bagels from here awhile back and they were delicious!! So when we were craving sandwiches for lunch and searching on Yelp we came across this cafe and I wanted to go in for myself and give it s try. We arrived around 1:30pm and they were closing at 2pm so I was glad they still have a good amount of options to choose from (for bagels). They had a lunch special combo for sandwiches so we opted in for that. I got Reuben which was BOMB.COM along with a side of pasta salad and a chocolate cake. My husband got the turkey avocado with a side of chips and a chocolate cake. Everything was delicious except for the fact that I found hair in my chocolate cake. I was sooooo excited to eat it too because it was an unexpected surprise. Went there for sandwiches and came out with a cake - came up!! Hopefully next time I won't find anymore surprises in my food. 

Their blended drinks are also yummy but a bit on the sweet side so you have to like sweet to fully enjoy it. 

Plenty of parking
Convenient location in the corner plaza right off Power
Accepts credit cards
Lots of tables available"}
{"text":"Love this place, best bagels in town!  Soft and chewy, and fresh, not too much bread-almost like brioche. No need to hollow out.

I got the melt which was perfect. Friends of mine got the breakfast sandwiches with egg meat and cheese.and those were great too. Free mini muffins too for a sweet treat. Super friendly service and coffee was yum too! Go here!"}
{"text":"First visit there and not going to lie, it's a little old, dusty and unkept but our bagel sandwiches were delicious! We've been to the usual bagel shops and even 1 hour before this place was closing our bagels and sandwiches were so fresh. Friendly service too. We will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for slow and unorganized service, unfriendly cashiers, and half toasted/cooked bagel sandwiches, this is the place for you! The hot & toasted bagel sandwiches were cold and filled with raw veggies and fake egg. One of the orders was wrong and they squished disgusting blueberry muffins on top of the bagels. They threw the bagel containers in the bag and messed up the entire sandwich. Also shortchanged me $10, but I caught it. You can watch them make the sandwiches and see that they mess around the entire time instead of making food and are unsanitary. This place needs a course on how to make a quick, tasty bagel sandwich. Better to just make your own at home."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast bagel sandwich! I got the westerner, egg with ham, bell peppers and onions along with pepperjack cheese on a toasted wheat bagel. I asked them to add a little cream cheese and they charged $1.25 ... got home to find no cream cheese dang it!! Great sandwich nevertheless."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee!  I had the Westerner bagel and it was very, very good, along with the mini blueberry muffin which they added as a free goodie. Since I travel for work in Mesa quite often this will be my new coffee/bagel hangout.  There is outdoor seating which is nice."}
{"text":"All of the bagels are made fresh here everyday. They are true back east style bagels. The best I've had in AZ by far! The lox bagel was amazing! Love supporting family owned places! If you love good bagels this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Horrible bagel breakfast sandwich ...
We had the sprites kokobelli has egg,peeper jack, salsa and sausage on a toasted jalapeño bagel . The sausage was nasty the salsa was sweet the whole thing was just nasty..."}
{"text":"Relatively good bagels and sandwiches and such. They close at 2 o'clock however, and several times I have been in there and by 1:30 they are mopping the floor and picking up chairs putting them on tables. Did not make those coming in to grab something knowing they were still open for another 30 minutes feel very welcome, and those of us still sitting there felt like we were rushed out. Closing at 2 does not mean at 2 o'clock the employees get to go home, it means at 2 o'clock you lock the doors and then you start doing the floors and cleaning up."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed. Ordered the Bagel Melt, which was a cheddar cheese bagel sandwich with melted cheese, red onion, tomato, and chive cream cheese. I ordered it with turkey bacon and a \"kokoccino\" - their own version of a frappe. The meal came with a bitty blueberry muffin.

The cream cheese was nice and melty, the bagel itself had a great taste, and the kokoccino was not too sweet or too bitter coffee tasting.

I would love to come here more often if it wasn't so out of my way!!"}
{"text":"French Toast Bagel- duex s'il vous plait !

The bagels here are huge compared to other bagel places. They are crunchy on the outside soft warm and delicious on the inside (if you toast them). My favorite is the French toast, but they are all pretty great. They have a variety of cream cheese favors to choose from. I prefer peanut butter on my bagels! The OJ is fresh but a bit pricey. If you can purchase day old bagels, you can get a good deal for a dozen."}
{"text":"This place has great bagels but they lost something for me the other day when my 70 year old parents walked their for breakfast and were not even offered a glass of water while they waited for the café to open.  It's already warm in Arizona so they were excited to get there early for a bagel.  My family didn't realize the time was later on a Saturday and so when they asked if they could get coffee/water the staff person setting the outdoor tables up just said no and walked back in the café.  A little kindness goes along way these days!"}
{"text":"Went in at lunch time, no customers should have been our first clue.  Every single table was dirty, not an exaggeration, I had to clean one off myself before sitting down. There was food all over the floor and crumbs on the chairs.  While waiting for our food, numerous coughs and hacks were coming from behind the counter where our sandwiches were being made, second clue.  As my husband looked behind the counter, the young man that was supposed to be making our sandwiches was texting on his phone.  Put his phone down, continued to make our sandwiches. No gloves and didn't wash his hands, third clue. At this point my husband and I decided we would not be eating the food that came out. Good choice on our part. His sandwich arrived with hardened yellow cheese and deli meats that looked unappetizing. In the trash both of ours went. Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!! Had the Sunrise Bagel breakfast sandwich and it was yummy. Bagels were so fresh , I took a half dozen hoe and just as wonderful the next day!!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for a bagel place. But as they say you get what you pay for. Since this is a one-of-a-kind gem with all the unusual flavors of bagels and cream cheese I'd say go here often if you wanna splurge. If not, then stop in early and  check out the discount basket."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for a great bagel and lox, this place was next on the list.  The ambiance was about what you'd expect and the staff was friendly.  I grabbed a bagel with lox (served open face) and was very impressed.  Great spread, great fish and tomato, but the standout by far was the bagel.  Crispy and chewy and very large.  I will be back for sure.  I read so much on Yelp about the bacon and scallion spread that I grabbed it on a bagel to go.  Was not disappointed.  I also like that this seems to be a local family run spot.  Always excited to support and advocate for that.

One small detail that I thought was odd, apparently they were letting some of the clientele pick what was on their TV - a spot you'd usually see something like sportscenter or CNN -  Someone chose a rerun of mama's family (guessing, I didn't recognize it for sure).  It added a really strange vibe.  Probably a one off but thought it was odd   :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 10 years and let me tell you the bagels and cream cheese are the BEST. The service is subpar but if you're just going for food and don't mind waiting a long while- you'll be set! 

+ this is the second time I've gotten a smoothie and they're not even full."}
{"text":"Bagels are beautiful and delicious. Kokobelli's makes bagels, and in turn, is beautiful and delicious. 

They have a wide selection of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, with my personal favorite, french toast. They also have coffee, drinks, and even some pastries to choose from as well. During my visit, I had a westerner bagel, and it came with a small muffin with it. The westerner was delicious and the french toast bagel is so good by itself, no cream cheese is necessary. They also sell excess bagels from the previous day for a cheaper price, and that is definitely a bargain worth taking when it is available. If you want to be quick about it, you can select your own bagels from the racks, bag them, and pay to head on your way out. 

They offer selection, convenience, and deliciousness, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning before headed out to hike, as I needed a pre hike meal. I needed something light but still fulfilling. 
So I got a bagel sandwich, specifically the spirited kokobelli. 

Line forms pretty quick if you get here after 10:30am. 
I came at the right time. However, there was still a slight wait from the previous people that ordered. That take a little bit longer as there's maybe 3 people prepping the food in the back. 

Waited about 15mins. They also came out and reported they ran out of sausage, so I had to use Ham substitute. 

Food: Spirited kokbelli comes with egg, pepperjack, salsa, and suppose to be sausage but I got ham instead - on jalapeno bagel. Taste was pretty much as expected with those ingredients. Nothing different or spectacular, but a clean basic ingredient sandwich. I thought it was ok for a pre-hike meal. Not oily and won't bog you down before hiking. 

Price: $6.47 total for just the sandwich.
Not too expensive. 

Service: slightly slow, you will wait if their busy, but thankfully not too long. Just don't be hangry when you arrive and find a line 

Misc: They have a lot of different bagel selections if that's your thing.

Parking: bit parking lot outside. 

Pro: Free bagel samples at the counter"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sandwiches, forgot a couple things (pickles, wrong dessert, missing things from sandwich recipes, time) that are more minor gripes.  Cleanliness was probably the big thing I noticed with all the dirty tables.  Maybe was after lunch rush or something.  I'll try it again as we just moved into the neighborhood and I love me some bagels."}
{"text":"First post but worth it!  Cinnamon crunch bagels and French toast bagels!  Yum will be taking some home."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great Price! Best employees! Very Clean! Special notice to manager Nicole and cashier Nicole! Leave with a full stomach filled with quality food! Good for breakfast and lunch! Yum!"}
{"text":"Decent bagels. I'm a New Yorker, so the bagels don't even compare. However, what they lacked in that department, they made up in SERVICE. The girls there were so nice and accommodating. 

I had to bring a bagel back because it was too sugary for my mother. I was going to just buy her another. They replaced the bagel for free, quickly (with a line nearly out the door). They smiled the entire time, knew many of the customers by name. 

The place just felt good. Any time I'm in Arizona, I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Bagels, muffins, sandwiches are very good.
They understand the concept of the \"shmear\" and also offer mix-ins.

I'd give them a 5 rating except for the inefficiency of their ordering.  Staff is extremely gracious and apologetic. The bottleneck is the ordering system. Line is usually out the door yet there's only one register open and the staff taking orders and cashiering is also taking phone orders. Instead of doing one or the other she attempts to do both and at times mixes the order."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot and come here often. They always give a lot of cream cheese (my favorite part) and their bagels are big and fresh.  I typically get the onion or the blueberry bagel with plain cream cheese and it never fails to make my morning.  I've had the lox sandwich once too and it was really good, so I definitely recommend that as well.  Service is great and fast, great variety in bagels and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday looking for a good cup of coffee. The staff was really sweet & the coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ok, this is my first negative review.   I  Saw this place had 4 stars and I've wanted to try this place for a long time. I drove 5 miles past my  regular bagel joint so expectations were high.   There were about 6 people outside and 10 people inside so not that busy but the place looked like a hurricane passed through it.    Bagel pieces and paper napkins all over the place on ground.      Waited at front counter for 5 minutes while order taker finished making frappa something coffees.    Got order in and went to find a table and couldn't find one even moderately clean. 10 minutes standing hoping someone would clean a table ended by me asking the cashier for a paper napkin so I could wipe one down.    The only napkin dispenser in the entire place was empty.      As I was wiping a table down, the cashier walked passed me and smiled as she went into restroom.   

Got my food...bagel was great but coffee was warm at best.  

Final comment: understaffed.  Hire a table wiper and get them a broom."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I'll start off with the good. The bagels were amazing. Like best I have had awesome. Soft and chewy. Cream cheese was awesome. Wife had bagel melt and she loved it. I had bagel sandwich it was stellar. We ordered a cheese bagel with jalepeno cream cheese to give an accurate review. The sandwich and melt came with tasty little muffins. Awesome. The food again was stellar. And literally the best bagel I have ever had.

Being a bagel place they should have a good iced tea product. Both iced teas the had were TERRIBLE. We live in Arizona to me Iced tea is a must. They chinced on tea and I could tell. Call a China Mist rep.

The store feels crowded and cluttered and to make things worse, no tables were actually wiped off and the floor was full of crumbs and paper. The bathrooms were filthy and not attended to.

We will definetly come back to see if the place is a little cleaner.

But again kudos to Kokobelli for making the best bagel I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Great bagels! My coworker brings these to work every other Sunday and I just love the Everything Bagels, just awesome, great, delicious bagels!"}
{"text":"Horrible, in a word!! 
Their sandwiches are decent but their customer service is the worst!!  I use to pick up breakfast for a co-worker and myself a few times a month because it was right next door,  and they forget something EVERY SINGLE TIME!! They would charge me, of course, but then lie and tell me they didn't, even though I had the receipt!  I work in the industry so never made a big deal about it, I gave countless chances and excuses.  Until finally, I just stopped coming in.  I came in one more time after a year, again, for convenience, and they forgot the bacon on my sandwich.  When I went back in, they said they were out....That's fine, BUT WHY CHARGE FOR IT?!?  They have over charged me every friggin time and have forgotten something (no exaggeration) EVERY TIME, unless I check and go back.  But the worst of it?  They're never are apologetic or try and make it right, or ask me to come back in for a free coffee even?  They just aren't worth it, they are all around the worst I have ever experienced because of their consistency to disappoint and rip me off."}
{"text":"First time I came here was at the peak of snowbird season so I chalked it up to that. This is my second visit and I realize it was not. 

I ordered a jalapeño bagel with bacon and cheese. The bagel I got was clearly sliced with the same knife they use to chop onions all day judging by the flavor left threw the bagel and the fact that it had little purple pieces of onions randomly. The bagel itself seemed to be of the exact quality I have purchased at local grocers. 

The front counter girl was not friendly or welcoming in the slightest and to be put mildly was very inappropriately dressed to be working near/with food. I don't know what everyone sees in this place other than not having to personally use a toaster there is no justifiable reason to ever patronage this \"cafe.\""}
{"text":"This is best N.Y. style breakfast sandwhich of come across outside of N.Y.  Im really excited to go back. I live in Tempe so im not a regular but when im in the area i am making it a point to go by and get the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love stopping here if i have time before work.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because a few times that I have placed orders to go to bring to work, in which my friend/coworker likes to eat her sunrise with meat sandwich with jelly/jam and they charge you at least 1.25 extra for that mind you, forget to give me that jelly!  So once i get to work thinking they were being efficient as ever, they were not.  Only disappointment I have.  They have the best breakfast sandwiches using their bagels are made for each other especially if you order the cheese bagels in substitution for their onion or whatever else.  

They are not my favorite bagel of all time but they are the second in line in Arizona.  They will have my continued business if I am in the area."}
{"text":"\"Sunrise bagel\". Onion bagel (not nearly as good, crusty and chewy as the previous KOKOPELLI bagels), an egg and completely flavorless cheddar cheese.  I peeled away the top half of the bagel and I'm pretty sure they used a slice of Velveeta. What a joke. I want my $4 back."}
{"text":"Had a turkey bagel sandwich.  Ingredients were of high quality and the bagel was very tasty.  Enjoyable for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for my oil change to be finished around the corner and this place was a win! I got the sunrise with meat and it was delicious and the bagel was a toasted onion which is so crunchy and fluffy at the same time! Yum! Not to mention the price was great especially for the size and quality (& the free little muffin you get with it) Got a fresh cup of coffee and was handed a water cup without even having to ask! Love when that happens! After realizing I had a bit of a sweet tooth I noticed their cinnamon rolls which I had warmed up and it was scrumptious! The staff was great and went well over the top! Great place to come hangout!"}
{"text":"sure, these are good bagels and i like the place. nice cozy feel, nice employees, well-run. but i disagree with some of the reviewers. these are not true 'east coast' style bagels. these are more like rolls with holes. idk if they are really boiled or not, like a true bagel is. not dissing or anything, it was a nice fresh delicious bagel with cream cheese."}
{"text":"I had the bagel and lox... Been craving it since I was pregnant. Finally had one today on poppy seed. Def hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Sunrise sandwich with bacon. Comes with complimentary mini muffin. Delicious and warm!  Fast, friendly service! I'm sitting here watching all the \"regulars\" come in and the workers know everyone by name. It is so cute! This is my new favorite bagel place. Forget the chains! I will come here again and again."}
{"text":"This seems like a family operated shop. The lux bagel with the smoked salmon and capers is amazing. I used an everything bagel."}
{"text":"Good bagels but service is way too slow to make a toasted bagel with cream cheese-anything more than 15 minutes is not worth it."}
{"text":"This is a terrific, terrific bagel spot. Man oh man. The bagels are fresh, the service is quick and helpful and the food is delicious. Feels family owned and authentic. If you're in Mesa, look no further for a great breakfast and support a local business! 

I love a lox bagel. This morning (my third or fourth time here) they gave me.... This (photo added)! I mean... That's just impressive. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting friends in Mesa, the bagels and cream cheese are absolutely fantastic. The bacon scallion cream cheese is probably the best cream cheese I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place. I ordered a vanilla latte and I asked if I could have almond milk and add in some caramel syrup... the girl brings me a cup of ALMOND MILK and SYRUP. I went up to the counter to ask if my drink had espresso and she said, \"No.....do you want some?\" I said, \"yes.\" then she asks, \"How many shots do you want?\" At that point I just said: whatever a latte is supposed to come with. 

Idk if she was new or what but I have never seen anyone make a latte without espresso and then act shocked that you want some espresso."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday morning around 10am. Place was full of people. Good sign I found a gem. Staff was friendly and menu easy to understand. This is a order at the counter and they make the food then call your name. 
My onion bagel with egg, bacon and cheese was really good.  The coffee was hot and rich. Price was good too.
The only issue was the dining area was very tight for the amount of patrons on site. The tables were dirty too. Staff was not cleaning the tables as the establishment was too busy. There are outside tables and I'm sure they are used during the right times of the year."}
{"text":"This place amazeballs. 

Tons of different FRESH bagels, and a nice assortment of bagel sandwiches. Oh, and a few different cream cheeses also. 

Honestly, it's a bagel shop, and they do it well. I wish there was one of these places back home. So, since there isn't, I just have to go there everyday till I leave to head back home."}
{"text":"Very good bagels but the place is a bit pricey... after it is a ball of dough not diamonds..
That being said these are the best bagels I have had in AZ and yes better than Chompies!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place, so cute, so good!

My bf and I were on a road trip, we were leaving Mesa to head toward Las Vegas. A solid brunch was definitely needed before the long drive. I found this spot on yelp, duh, and gave it a try.

Service: oookay, the girl at the front was a little impatient while we were trying to make up our minds about what to order, it was our first time there... Anyways, the spot is clean and modern looking. Great place to just sit and talk after brunch!

Food: delicious and fairly priced!

We ordered 2 bagels for the road and two bagel sandwiches to-go
-sunrise with meat: $4.99: good price, delicious, solid portion, BACON is life.
-lox sandwich $7.49: even though it is pricier, it has plenty of smoked salmon and onion, I liked it a looooot

My boyfriend devoured the 2 bagels and said they were delish! Hahaha
If I end up going to school in Mesa, this place will definitely be one of my frequent spots!"}
{"text":"Short, sweet, to the point. This place has bagels, and they're cheap, and you can get stuff on em. Quick and friendly service, yummy bagels, lots of cream cheese. 
Nice weather so we sat on the patio. My husband said his egg sandwich was not quite as good as others he'd had. But, for the cost, awesome breakfast. Yum."}
{"text":"The first time we came here everything was great. I had an asiago bagel with spinach and artichoke cream cheese. It was absolutely delicious. The smoothie was also good. It took a while and they ran out of croissants for my moms sandwich. The service was great though so I would have given this place 4 stars. 

Today was not the same story. We came in around 11 and nearly all the bagels had ran out? Like really? Our choices of bagels were basically jalapeño, garlic, and cinnamon raisin. Almost 10/15 of the bins were empty. I was forced to get a Garlic bagel with spinach and artichoke cream cheese. The bagel had way too much of the garlic. Basically it was completely covered in dehydrated garlic stuff, that was NOT cooked. I had to take it all off an I'm actually a massive garlic fan. There was so much garlic it was so bitter. I don't know if I will be back. It seems like a waste of a drive if they run out of bagels so early"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect as far as a bagel shop in this neighborhood, but I was in the mood for a bagel and thought I would give it a try.  I was very pleasantly suprised.  Excellent bagels and cream cheese, dare I say on par with Chompies."}
{"text":"I'm all about the Sunrise on cheddar w/ turkey sausage. Great selection of fresh made bagels. Good deals on day old too. They need salsa to offer with the breakfast selections"}
{"text":"Delicious Bagels!  Best breakfast bagels w/mini muffin! My sister-in-law and family from Tucson just fell in love with these bagels too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bagel I've had in years, fresh, light & airy & toasted to perfection.    When in the area I'll definitely be back for more yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Family owned very friendly clean fast service great bagels lots of choices for cream cheese and types of bagels"}
{"text":"Had the best Sunrise bagel and the best little blueberry muffin. Love love this place. They know what they are doing with bagels and muffins!!!"}
{"text":"You get to choose your own bagel and then take it to the counter and pay for it. The bagel selection was not as big as other bagel stores have. Also to add cream cheese it's almost 2 dollars. I feel the bagels and a bagel with cream cheese are overpriced. The bagels overall did not have much flavor either."}
{"text":"Loved the food but the service sucked. Seemed like they didn't wanna be there. No smiles @ all & when telling them what we wanted we were rudely interrupted. This place is lucky the food is great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Has a large assortment of the most moist and tasty muffins around. You can tell the bagels are fresh and soft. Their hours are 6am-2pm so you can swing by before work and grab some breakfast on the way in. Very friendly and have always provided great service. Try it for yourself it is worth the stop. www.kokobellibagelcafe.com They have Bagels, Pastries, Sandwiches, Salads, Soups, Smoothies and Coffee. (Located North/West Corner of Power Rd & Southern)"}
{"text":"Selection and quality pretty good for AZ. The service is great, felt very welcomed and I believe it's family owned/run. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! every time i come in they make my day better with their awesome customer service. Will be back as much as i am in the area! Can not wait to try more things they suggest on the menu! Thanks for always being friendly."}
{"text":"Bagels are good, clean and relaxed atmosphere. Customer service is meh. Owner waited on us, no smile, welcome or thank you. When your order is ready, they call out your name leave your food on the counter and walk away. No \"Can I get you anything else? Thanks for coming in.... nothing\" Missed opportunity to make first time customers want to return."}
{"text":"The bagels are probably amazing.  I was going to buy some to take with, but after  trying to order a chinese chicken salad for lunch which they could not prepare for lack of ingredients my mom and I both decided on the cashew chicken salad with italian dressing.  I also had ice tea. We sat outside.  The tea was a little stale.  The table wasn't clean so I went back in to ask for them to bus it before they bring the food.  She cleaned it, but didn't really get the gunk off.  Then the salads were brought out in closed up styrofoam, like a to go order.  When we opened the boxes, one salad was quite a bit smaller than the other.  The lettuce was wet and huge with some pieces longer than my hand.  I went back inside to get a knife so we could manage the salad bites.  We proceeded to cut up the salad.  I noticed that we did not have the chibata roll, so I went back in and asked for them, oops, I was told I read the menu wrong, that was for the cashew chicken salad sandwich, I ordered the salad.  Ok, but a little misleading to order a cashew chicken salad with lettuce tomatoe and cucumber on a sandwich.  So back to the table.  The chicken was cubed in a mayo sauce so, why offer italian dressing, and there were no cashews anywhere.  Not one.  So I went inside to see if they had forgotten to add them and was told they are chopped into the chicken part of the salad.  Really?  Who chops cashews up to the size of peanuts that you put on top of a sudae?  She picked through the chicken salad they had just made and still couldn't show me any pieces, however,  she assured me they were in there.   I did find one tiny piece of a cashew in mine, but that was it.  I won't be trying their amazing bagels.  Why didn't I just go there for breakfast like everyone else?"}
{"text":"This is an incredible place. I have been coming here for 4 years. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are incredible. I love the free mini muffin!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened at the age of 13. Coming from a family from the east coast... Bagels are important. These are NYC bagel quality! I still come here now that I'm 22. Still the same quality since their opening day."}
{"text":"Never did I think I'd find a solid bagel in the state of AZ. Ever since I moved here from NY/NJ area, I came to terms with the fact that my go to order-- an everything bagel with egg and cheddar cheese would be just a distant memory however, Kokobelli bagels are bombbb. I just went for the first time last week and ordered a simple bagel and cream cheese--but I'm sold. I was going to do my usual order but didn't want to wait. Having that said, if you do want to order something like an egg & cheese bagel, the wait is about 20 minutes so plan accordingly. To top it all off, the staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Can't beat a great bagel and coffee! I enjoyed a bagel sandwich on an onion bagel, very good! I have even been back to grab bagels to take home."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to try it out one day and loved it. You get to choose a breakfast item and customize it with a bagel of your choice. Orange juice it fresh. You can see the workers work and it's clean. I just didn't like the way my iced coffee was made, maybe because it explained it horribly. However, there is a coffee refill station, so I didn't waste anything there. Bonus is that they sell day old bagels by the dozen for really cheap!"}
{"text":"Bagels just don't get any better than this!  Huge, fresh & flavorful... pretty much everything you could ask for in a bagel.  

When you start with a bagel this good, you can rest assured that your bagel sandwich will be awesome, as well.  

Great coffee drinks, juices and pasties, too!  I'd like a little more in terms of ambiance, but this is Mesa, so I'll settle for the typical east-valley suburban strip-mall setting with friendly service...  & amazing bagels."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The staff is very sweet, the bagels rival those I've had at home in NY, and the prices are right where they should be. If you're looking for a great breakfast or brunch place, look no further.

Overall, A++"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Mesa running an errand and were absolutely starving. Driving along Power, we didn't see any sandwich/lunch places except for Subway, so when we saw a sign for Kokobelli Bagel Cafe, we decided to stop there. The place itself was small - maybe 7-8 tables - and decked out in some very colorful Ikea decor/accessories. At the beginning of the line, there were bins with fresh bagels sorted by flavor and some bags of day-old (and discounted) bagels. 

The woman who took our order and rang us up was super-friendly and reminded me of one those down-to-earth waitresses in a neighborhood diner. She took our order (3 different bagels with cream cheese and a bagel sandwich - we were hungry, ok?!) and repeated it all back. We took a seat and waited just a few minutes for our order to be prepared. 

Some of the highlights:
-The texture of the bagels (not too dry or moist)
-The cheddar bagel (not too greasy)
-The spinach and artichoke cream cheese (like someone took the ubiquitous dip and successfully made it into cream cheese)

Some of the not-so-great parts:
-The blueberry bagel (the blueberries were fluorescent blue and tasted like the kind in blueberry muffin mix)
-The honey walnut cream cheese (overwhelmingly sweet; almost tasted like frosting)
-The breakfast bagel sandwich with salsa, cheese, egg, and sausage (the sausage and egg were cold and kind of flavorless)

I definitely give this place props for being a local bagel shop that still makes their own bagels and cream cheese. However, some of the flavors could use some work, and fresher/more natural ingredients would probably do the trick in a lot of cases."}
{"text":"I keep looking for real bagels and hoped this might be the place.  I'm sorry to report these are a long way from authentic...like you'd find in New York, L.A., or Chicago.  I had sesame, husband had onion.  Doughy and generic without that great \"toothsome\" crust and texture you'd expect from an authentic bagel...more like a big roll with a center hole.  We had them with an egg, double toasted.  They came out blonde and bready.  Service was slow, and they were out of coffee and half-and-half!  Think more like Dunkin' than deli."}
{"text":"This place is always good.  My wife and I are lucky to be close to this place and it's always decent service with great bagels at a reasonable price.  The smoothies and sandwiches are good as well but bagels are definitely the specialty.  We visit often."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gong through yet another ownership change and quality continues its downward spiral.  The Everything bagel used to rate 10 out of 10, but with the new recipe I wouldn't give them a 2.  Same with what used to be an awesome French Toast bagel - decline from a 10 to a 2.  Very dissappointing . this was the best bagel shop in the East Valley for many years .. I doubt I will go back ..  Look forward to Kneaders opening down the street."}
{"text":"We love this place and often order takeout sandwiches and salads. The fresh made bagels, sandwiches and salads are awesome, and the prices are very reasonable.

We especially would like to give a shoutout to Karina because when we went in today we had to complain about 2 previous orders which were not right when we got home. She listened and was extremely gracious and professional in her replies and promised that she would address these issues with her employees. We were very impressed and we will look forward to having much more  of their delicious food again."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels. Fluffy, chewy, delicious!  Their cream cheese was nice too. I was not too happy with their iced tea. It seemed like they hadn't cleaned out the China Mist container in a while. It tasted wrong. I should have said something, but I got it on my way out. That was disappointing. I would go back for the bagels though."}
{"text":"Nice local bagel shop. Much better than the chains. I recommend the Sunrise with sausage...filing and good! I have also had the maple walnut cream cheese. It was outstanding! Great coffee...friendly staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bagel places. Usually I seek out einstein bagels but this place has a lot of bagel sandwich options that most bagel places don't. Great option if you want a little bit cheaper breakfast than a brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Good bagels and great variety of bagels and cream cheese. Sandwiches are good and plentiful. Always busy. :)"}
{"text":"Went to grab a blueberry bagel. Not very good. After two bites I threw the rest away. I'll stick to Bruegger's or even Safeway's bagels taste better!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go here again bagels were not great and I   paid almost 10.00 for 2 plain bagels and plain cream cheese but since I was eating one now and one later cream cheese was placed in containers to go they would not cut my bagels I asked for two extra sides of cream cheese which I had to pay for then they did not give them to me it was ridiculous I'll go to frys for a bagel and cream cheese next time"}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast here this morning. Very cute place and everyone so super friendly. Line was kind of long, but I guess that means they're goo. Will go back! I had the sunrise bagel which was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food & nice people. 
However, their Wi-Fi was often slow and sometimes non-functional (and no one else seemed to be using it). The managers knew about this problem and fixing it didn't seem like a high priority. They did eventually go and check their router -- not sure how that turned out. But I hope they're more proactive about this in the future."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. It has gone SO downhill. The customer service is absolutely non-existent. They are constantly getting orders wrong. I went in TWO hours before they closed and they were out of bagels. This place has gotten SO bad. The quality is not even worth it. The bagels and cream cheese used to outweigh their service, but not anymore. Congratulations, you guys went from a five star to a one star. I will definitely NOT be back."}
{"text":"Went here today after my dental appointment across the street and was STARVING! I got two bags of bagels, their prices were pretty decent for the size and the smell of these babies, a hot sandwich called the bagel melt and a chai tea latte. It was super busy and took a little while but the staff was super friendly and hardworking. The bagel melt was super tasty, it had cheese, tomatoes and onions (vegetarian here). The product was hot and fresh and I had no intention of eating the whole thing but I did and it was delicious. Makes me excited to try the other bagels I bought. However, I absolutely BEG you do not, I said DO NOT buy the chai tea latte. Save yourself the four bucks. It was just plain coffee and I absolutely HATE the taste and smell of coffee. I asked the girl if it really was not a mistake and it was the chai tea latte because I watched her make it, she assured me it was their chai tea and if i wanted she would be happy to make me another one. They were busy so I declined, especially if it would have been the same thing. So so so gross. SO gross. I went to another coffee shop after haha. I am not a coffee snob I just don't like coffee and I am seven months pregnant so I don't want to drink something that may potentially have tons of caffeine (I know chai tea has some caffeine and the beverage lasts me about 2-3 days because I drink sparingly). I realized afterwards that no one else was buying drinks there and were bringing their own in. Live and learn! I still would totally rate 5 stars and would go again. The food was delicious and the staff was very nice. There was lots of room and I like that it's more locally owned than the big chains. I just won't order a beverage next time!"}
{"text":"Nice bagel and lox at Kokobelli Bagel Cafe. Family owned business, service was good place was clean. Bagel was tasty, you need to specify your bagel choice and how you want it otherwise you get what they serve. Plenty of lox,tomato and onion. Lox was fresh and not too salty. Topped it off with a fresh mini blueberry muffin. Not too many fresh bagel places in East Mesa. Got this one bookmarked."}
{"text":"Sign me up for an Asiago cheese bagel with Jalapeño cream cheese any day of the week! Never ordered any of their breakfast or lunch sandwiches, but their soup is quite excellent. Can be a little pricey but well-worth the occasional trip. Get there early to ensure you get your favorite bagel, for as the day wears on they frequently run out of the more popular flavors."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time based on good reviews on Yelp.  Took six bagels and the chive cream cheese to go.  It was about 12 noon and the place was pretty busy with people ordering bagel sandwiches to eat there.

Being that it was noon, I didn't expect a huge selection but there were plenty of the flavors I like:  everything, sesame and pumpernickel along with some others I didn't pay attention to.  The french toast bagels were gone.  Sorry I missed those.  

When I got home I toasted the everything bagel the way I like and put on the cream cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  There is only one thing that I would change to make this 9+ experience into a 10:  I would make the bagels a little denser in texture.  I miss Bruegger's Bagels which went out of business recently.  To me, those were a perfect 10.  

I'll be returning to Kokobelli often."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel shop!  They have a great selection of bagels--my favorite is the cheddar.  But where they really shine is with their spreads.  Every spread I have tried has been outstanding.  They are chunky and you can tell the ingredients are fresh.  I hate spreads that puree the ingredients and you can't tell they're there.  Here, the veggies in the garden spread are thick cut and identifiable.  The tops is jalapeno spread!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my Friday morning tradition!  I go most Friday mornings before work for a pumpernickel bagel with lox cream cheese.  The bagels are amazing, and they are usually generous with the cream cheese.  I have never had a bad bagel here, even when I've tried flavors that I don't usually get, such as chocolate chip.  They have quite a variety of bagels, and also offer breakfast sandwiches.  The lox sandwich is also very good, but a bit pricey.  The staff is very friendly, and usually remembers exactly what I order.  I usually get my food to go, but on the few occasions I have eaten there, it has always been clean."}
{"text":"Right down the street from my new job, this place is an instant hit with me!  I love the bagels, remniscent of East Coast bagels.  I love the service, complete with attention to detail (repeating the order back to me and reminding me that cream cheese costs extra) and friendliness (smiles and eye contact all around!)  I sat on a comfy red couch in the back by the window.  There's a shelf full of books and games by the sofa and two comfy chairs.  I love this place!  They also have great specials."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because of the customer service not the food. I've came in twice and the same old lady was just rude. I'm pretty sure her name is Sara. We tell her what we want and she reads the order back to us and ALWAYS gets it completely wrong so we have to repeat ourselves multiple times and it's extremely frustrating. And she is just pushy and rude. Whoever owns this place needs to teach her how to talk to people."}
{"text":"Good bagels and the bagels a lot bigger than most places! Everything my boyfriend and I ordered was great. There seems to be a good variety of spreads and bagels too."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, this place is NOT in Fiesta Mall like someone else stated. It's on Power Rd. and Southern in Mesa. 

I went back to this little bagel place after a two year absence. It had been so long mainly because if I had gone back any earlier, my husband would have killed me. His wheat & dairy allergies meant no more bagels for him, and for a die hard bagel fan, that's hard to swallow. In an act of solidarity I held out as long as possible.

On a day before Christmas, I was running some errands & thought I'd pop in. The first thing I noticed was that they had changed the interior slightly. The menu was stark and ugly. They had painted deals in the window reminiscent of a fast food restaurant. I suppose everyone has to attract business and maybe I'm a snob, but I found it tacky. 

I got an everything bagel toasted with lox cream cheese. It came out on one of those cardboard type red and white trays, you know, cafeteria school lunch style. They used to have little plastic trays with tissue paper. The presentation was definitely nicer before. 

The lox cream cheese didn't have as much lox in it as I remember. While the bagel tasted the same, they clearly didn't toast it enough because it came out virtually cold. It was doughy without an ounce of warmth. I was so disappointed. 

One of the workers informed me they had changed owners when I inquired but all the bagels were the same. I'd suggest if you go, to ask them to double toast your bagel. Maybe that would have made mine taste better."}
{"text":"Really popular place - the line was out the door! 

Even though they were busy and I had lots of questions they didn't rush me and were really friendly.

Service was pretty quick too.

They make their own cream cheeses - you have to try the Bacon Scallion, it is SO good!

Nice breakfast sandwiches and mini blueberry muffins!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and yes the bagels are good but today I witnessed the worst customer service and sad to say I will not be returning. I was standing in line with two customers ahead of me and the person who is toasting and topping the bagels comes from the back sees one of her friends in line asks them what they are having and proceeds to make the customer who is first in lines bagels and then hands her friend who is three customers behind me his order. Hello how does this happen? how do you come out from the back see your friend call him by name asks him what he wants and make his bagel and serve him before the 4 people ahead of him ? Please Kokobelli Bagel Cafe explain that to me!! Because I still don't understand .."}
{"text":"So we used to love this place. Pretty much went every weekend for a bagel for years. I don't know why it changed but the people are new and the quality has gone way Down. Sad to say but we need to find a new place for our bagel fix."}
{"text":"Moved here from NY. I haven't found a really good bagel yet in Phoenix. This place is better than most."}
{"text":"Cute little bagel shop! They have free wifi, delicious bagels, good lattes and frozen coffee drinks and they make their own cream cheese too. The asiago bagel with jalapeño cream cheese is really yummy! And my daughter loves the chocolate chip bagels. It always has customers and it seems to do good business. Staff is friendly and the outdoor patio has comfy chairs and tables to enjoy your food outside. 
Oh and they also have sandwiches and breakfast bagels for those looking for more. Would definitely recommend!"}
