{"text":"EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EATING HERE    I wasn't only just a customer, I was a former employee of dairy freeze. I really liked the poutines and milkshakes and was delighted to get a job there.   Oh boy did it open my eyes. The cooks and cashiers smoke cigarettes in the kitchen. The burgers and bacon are \"lightly cooked\" and kept in a bin by the grill, ready to throw on when someone orders. Same with the souvlaki. And oh god the onion rings are precooked days in advance andjust refried to order. The ice cream machines have to have the spoiled milk layer on top scraped out every night so the whole bag doesn't go sour as well.   I would have to say the most appalling thing I witnessed as an employee was them dropping burgers/ANYTHING REALLY, rinsing/refrying and SERVING IT TO THE CUSTOMERS.   This is sad and wrong and I'm more than surprised they haven't been hit with a lawsuit. Beware of what you eat."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty. Defiently my go to for a steak on a bun!  Their fries are really good also!"}
{"text":"I would recommend checking out this place just because it is totally old school!! Two stars awarded because the food is edible but not great.  I usually get a burger and fries. They add your burger toppings in front of you Harvey's style and usually it is an incredibly grumpy old man who loads everything on. The patty is salty and not very homemade tasting. The fries are good and are fresh cut. The gravy is the super thick brown stuff that you would expect from this type of place.  Dairy Freeze also has a long list of milkshake flavours. I've only had the butterscotch one which had a fakey flavour. I ordered the fish and chips once and it was surprisingly good - thick halibut and fries for around $10.  I think most of the people who go here have been going for a very long time. It is cheap, fast food that isn't bad, and you know nothing will change. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews here are for burgers.  This place has always specialized in Steak on a Bun.  If you try the Steak I think you will change your rating.  Whenever I'm in the area and hungry I always drop in for a Steak on a Bun.  Never had a problem."}
{"text":"I hate to give one star but honestly I can't give any more than that. I ordered a cheese burger. I was craving one something fierce. What I got though was a patty that had the texture of a sponge and the mayo tasted off. The place is really run-down which doesn't really bother me but if you're going to let the decor slide then the food should kick ass. Nothing is a win for me here."}
{"text":"Dairy Freeze is quite the experience. It has greasy breakfasts (stopped being served at noon), but dinners you can get 24hrs. Like a roast beef platter at 7 AM.   It's got some real old timey-charm. There's some poster on the wall saying they have the best fries in Toronto in like 1987. Fries must not have been that good back then."}
{"text":"Great burgers and amazing onion rings. Fries and gravy are salty deliciousness, though not the best fries you'll ever have. Fantastic place to eat when you're stumbling home drunk at 2am. Perfectly greasy and perfectly satisfying. I definitely recommend giving this old favourite a try."}
{"text":"Used to really enjoy this place, wait that was 10 years ago.   Each time I go in thinking it will get better again, it doesn't.  This place is going downhill fast or maybe slowly, who knows.  Please get your shite together.  Burgers, onion rings and steak sandwiches were once actually worth a drive to this place, now everything is grease flavoured. Edited to add,  service is pretty bad these days as well."}
{"text":"This place was listed as one of the top 12 greasy spoons on blogTO's list.  Really?  Did the fine folks at blogTO just throw darts?    The food wasn't terrible, but there's plenty to exclude this place from such a list.  Ordering at the counter is one of them.  Another is the plastic cutlery, paper and foam plates and cups.  Love global warming?  You'll love this place.  It's really a burger place, and I don't expect my burgers and fries to be served on china with metal utensils, but there's something about eating eggs and home fries with a plastic fork.  Top 12 in T.O.?  I think not. --------------------------------------- Hmmm, just re-read the criteria on blogTO.  These were voted upon by their readers.  I'd like to see the documentation on that! ;-)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was 5 years old and now I am 34. Amazing prices and the food is great. Big portions for little money and big taste!! It has gone through a few management changes but it never affected the taste of the food thank goodness. My daughter fell in love with their milkshakes. I would highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Toronto's answer to the Alamo Freeze of FNL. Delicious soft serve, burgers and the like.  The place looks like it hasn't been updated since 1973 but that is part of the charm. Large portions and quick service."}
{"text":"This place still keeps on....best onion rings in the city. Fresh cut fries are fantastic too.   I'm 50 and I've been going there since before I could drive! Only wish they would do half fries half onion rings cause I can't decide and can't have  full orders of both."}
{"text":"GREAT fries and gravy, maybe best in the city IMO, from this VERY old-school greasy-spoon burger joint, which from me is a compliment!    Fries are fresh-cut and really excellent, the gravy is pre-fab, but is the good beefy type made with flour, which I prefer to the typical tan coloured corn-starchy oddly sweet gravy like Golden Star and many others use.  Try the Steak on a Kaiser vs. a burger, it's really excellent with a few layers of thin grilled steak that's tender and yummy, especially if you ask them not to overcook it.  Burger is patty-style, rather than homeburger.  They also make a very good toasted Western sandwich, lots of ham and onion and cooked nicely browned, the old school diner way, but only if you arrive before noon, as they are very strict about breakfast items NOT being available after the lunch rush begins.  Bottom line: If you go for fries with gravy, and an old-school burger-joint Steak-on-a-K, or a toasted western, you will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"$15 for 2 burgers and a fries big enough to share. Faster than McDonalds too. Old fashioned and tasty. I often have issues with old oil coming up on me after eating fast food. Didn't happen here. Lots of foot traffic and decent parking. Seems this place is always busy. The other thing I like is that you can customize your toppings. No mayo? No problem! More onions? Sure! Pickle on the side? Yep."}
{"text":"First time at a legendary spot. It did not disappoint. The burger looked good and I was told it was delicious. The chicken souvlaki, classically dressed with tzatziki, onions and tomatoes, on a bun, was tender and fresh and decadent. Finally the onion rings thick with batter, freshly crunchy and tender at the same time were shared by all.  The space is run down, but expected nothing less. Very authentically 70's. Don't look or touch the underside of the tables...70's gum.  I enjoyed the experience and food!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. It's got retro charm, but I thought the burger wasn't very great. The Hubster really really enjoyed his, but I was left a bit disappointed.  Service was fast, and they definitely have their fans, as it was pretty busy. I think I might try something other than the burger if I ever go here again."}
{"text":"Best onion rings. Best burgers. Dinner dish is big and tasty. Taking 1 star back for plastic forks and paper plate. Affordable. Old style. Will stop on a run but will be shy to bring girlfriend. Try steak on a bun. delicious food, not fancy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped here after we got to Toronto late night. Had a cheeseburger and it was actually pretty good. Staff were friendly and order was ready fairly quick. Clean place as well."}
{"text":"Not the worst, not the best. Came here for breakfast and was surprised that it seemed pretty popular. It's cafeteria style, red trays, plastic forks, paper plates. The food was edible but but nothing to write home about. Eggs could have been cooked better. But the food was fast and the home fries hot and meal came with a drink.   Dislike: they don't have a recycling bin...."}
{"text":"my experience at this place has been slipping in recent month, in my most recent experience the fish and chips where subpar. the fries were obviously old(I know this because, I've tried eating their fries after putting them away over night, in the past) they where tasteless and dry. as hungry as I was I couldn't bring my self to finish the fries, as I thought I would  choke on them. the fish was flavourless,even after dousing it in vinegar it had no flavour.  The only good thing in the meal was the coleslaw. But Nearly $30.00 isn't worth it for a plate of flavourless and dry garbage and a decent coleslaw. Disappointing because I've experienced good service at this place and I am bewildered at the decline in service I've been experiencing as of late. I will return, I just hope they get their act together, this is the only decent burger joint for nearly ten blocks, not to mention the most reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Parking is limited!   The seats are super cool here - very retro. The menu is a classic mix of diner selects. Steak on a Kaiser, burgers, milkshakes, etc!   The ladies weren't nice but they weren't rude. Very average service feel. They do accept card - I used Visa.   I noticed that the milkshakes had different fruit flavours, besides strawberry, like cherry. Oddly enough, I've never had one of that flavour before, and I feel like I don't normally see that flavour available either... I'm definitely going to try that out next time.   I'm surprised at how clean this place is too. All the tables were wiped down, ketchup/vinegar bottles were as clean as they could be and organized, and the women's washroom was recently cleaned.   We got burgers, fries and onion rings! The onion rings were heavier than I thought they would be. They're battered like fish! The fries were fat and soft - MY FAVE! The burgers weren't crazy good, but they were what I expected. I liked how all the toppings looked fresh - lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, etc."}
{"text":"Great if you are drunk and hungry!   The burgers are good quality and toppings like Harvey's. The price is average, but portions are big.   I want to try more. Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Went in for more than just a coffee.  Wouldn't want to base my review off of that.     Ordered a milkshake with a burger.  My friend ordered a souvlaki dinner from what I recall.    Milkshake was the saving grace for my entire meal;  burger was nothing special.  If anything it wasn't all that tasty.  Somewhat blase. I don't know how that was possible as I did put on a number of toppings.    Pure jokes when my friend found ice in his salad.   Mediocre order taking system... Can't imagine anyone being comfortable shouting orders over a mic.   This place has kind of a retro feel to it.   Needs a bit of a refresh.  Maybe an update."}
{"text":"This place must have been around since world war 2 and it feels like it. The menu, the Sears and even the food is old style diner. Usually that's not a bad thing because you say to yourself that they must be doing some great stuff to stay in business for so long but honestly I think its just that the people coming in are the same people that used to come here as kids so the only thing driving them here is nostalgia. So we had some burgers, onion rings, fish and chips. The usual greasy food.  The burgers are fine, the onion rings were oily as hell and the haddock was just unbearable.  If you like your burger done to your specifications go to Harvey's, I guarantee better food."}
{"text":"This souvlaki / burger joint used to be good.  Went there tonight and I tell you, things have changed.  The souvlaki is good, fries brutal!  Still looks like it was in teh '80s.  Looks like the same guy behind the grill.  Not the best but good enough.  2 Stars tops."}
{"text":"This place is everything you would expect from a diner. Regular tasting fries, burgers, sandwiches and shakes. I've had fries and burgers from this place twice and it was nothing special. Fries just taste like regular home fries anyone could make, the burger wasn't bad..sort of tasted like harveys but there wasn't anything too great or special about it that would make me come back. It does get busy throughout lunch with locals and construction workers just looking for a place to grab a quick burger. This place reminds me a lot of a food truck you would find parked outside of a construction site. I am surprised it is still open however for their prices I suppose people just want to a great deal.  Wouldn't come back,.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a kid! Burgers are charbroiled-delicious and the onion rings can't be missed. Dairy Freeze might have an odd name, but it's a classic that can't be missed!"}
{"text":"Legit the burgers and toppings are hands down the absolute bomb. I feel like a fat cow when I leave this place because they don't skimp on their toppings. I heard that the original place was a Dairy Queen and they kept everything that was left behind. It's a dive but so worth the trek."}
{"text":"I won't go back.  The food was cold, greasy and was served on paper plates & plastic utensils   The cook was yelling and belittling a female staff member in front of everyone.  When I spoke up to tell him to stop, he started yelling at me and calling me a fucking piece of shit,and told me to get the fuck out, or he would break me in two !!     ( ok tuff guy ) With families and their children sitting in the dining room I felt that his attitude and behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable and he doesn't deserve our business !!"}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I've been here, but from what I recall it was an above average meal at a fair price.  Their burgers are pretty good, nothing gourmet about them but well above your typical mcdonald's or burger king burgers.  Their fries are nothing special but their onion rings are pretty good if I recall correctly.  The restaurant itself is kind of old school, it's been around since my dad was a teenager and he always recalls it being a pretty good place to get a quick meal.  All in all a worthwhile place to go if you're in the neighborhood and looking for an above average burger."}
{"text":"Went for a walk down st Clair and decided I would stop when something caught my eye. I am happy I saw this place. It's an old school diner done well.  Had a cheeseburger and it was better than any chain burger. The cook was friendly, and topped it to my liking.  Only complaint was the cashier who seemed disinterested in everyone and everything. She actually filled up my pop with one hand whiles eating a granola bar with the other.   Will be back to try the steak on a bun."}
{"text":"24 hour greasy spoon (or dive, depending on how you look at it)  Breakfast served from (5AM-12PM). I wish I had come earlier, because i love brekky.  Got the hamburger and fries.  Burger was smaller that i was hoping for.  reminded me of a Harveys burger, but better (same size though). (I'm not really a Harvey's fan though. They dress it in front of you like at Harveys, then wrap it in a few sheets of paper.  Fries were OK, but not the \"best non gourmet fries in the city\" like the 10 year old newspaper review on the wall says.  My co-diner got the hot roast beef sandwich.  Although it on the recommended section of he menu I would not get this next time.  Beef was hot, and they dressed it for you. (how are you supposed to dress a roast beef sandwich anyway?)  There was gristle that made some of the pieces hard to eat.  It tasted more like a thinly sliced steak sandwich. Not bad, but not what I was expecting.   Milkshake was quite runny, they didn't even have to use the blender.  Stuff comes out of a machine, and they put in some syrup flavoring.  The fake taste and \"inauthenticity\" of the shake is exactly what i was looking.  I wanted a banana milkshake that tasted like the banana Popsicles of my youth. It was exactly what I got, yummy fake goodness.  The have a long list of flavors, chocolate, strawberry, banana (yummy fake goodness), rum butter, some flavors I have forgot, and ...... grape (what???).  The place looks like it hasn't changed for the last 20 years. Is this bad? If the food is great, I think it would be a plus.  Unfortunately, the food is only OK, so it doesn't come off at kitschy.  Would I come back here? If i'm doing an overnight shift, and i'm starving. This place is 24 hrs (so i've heard, I don't actually remember seeing documented proof either way) and you can't have enough 24 hour places.   Is the burger worth the trip? I would save my money for Jumbo Burger down the street. BUT, if its late, I'd take this place over the 24hr McDonald's down the street.   Is the large shake worth $4? if i can't find fake banana syrup to make this on my own, then definitely. If you want an old fashioned natural shake, go elsewhere. I want to try the grape  shake if I ever come back.  Hopefully i get a thicker shake next time.  Doubt it though, they have the thinnest straws, so i don't think I could drink it if it was less runny."}
{"text":"Was disappointed after eating here. I got a cheeseburger and regular fries. The burger buns were extremely soggy and the burger itself was very messy. The fries were mediocre at best, certainty nothing special. They weren't even crispy. I likely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Dairy Freeze for a Long Time Now! Great place for Lunch and a Classic Joint after a NightClub!! Amazing Fries but My favorite is the Onion Rings! I also Love there Chicken Sandwich! The Burgers are Good but I don't go there for the Burgers. This place will always Legendary to me!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the greasiest of greasy spoon places I've been to. Some friends and I came in for breakfast late one weekday morning. The service was fine, really nothing special. The food was ok at best. While I don't expect great things from places like this I would have expected a smidge better.   Watch out for the salt shakers here. You could slide a toothpick through the holes in the cap they're so large."}
{"text":"Good Old fashioned burger joint.  Classic thick style onion rings and crispy fries if you ask for them.   It's a feel-a-little-grease-on-the-roof-of-your-mouth kinda place.   condiments are fresh - burgers on a kaiser(option), fries and onion rings classic.  Staff, meh - did i mention the food is good?"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the world, onion rings on point, love the fries in the box and the atmosphere. GOAT"}
{"text":"If you're reading this review you're probably unaware of the fact that this place in a Toronto institution. It's literally been around for eternity, and hasn't changed at all. As children to new Italian immigrants in the 60's this place set the benchmark for what a burger place should for my parents, as it did for a generation of others. Obviously ownership has changed through the years and this place isn't going to renew your conception of what a hamburger should be, but it's got a charm reminiscent of a time forgotten. Milkshakes, dingy vinyl seats, wood paneling and the smell of grease. I swear by the steak on a kaiser. Not passing up on the bagel-sized onion rings either. Definitely a contender for the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The best late night joint! But also really delicious food - so many options from burgers to chicken souvlaki and steaks on kaiser!! They make a mean Greek salad  always have a craving for"}
{"text":"Simply awful.  Went with a friend on Sunday afternoon. Got a steak on a bun, onion rings and a drink.  Over $16!!!! Steak had no taste and was like rubber!  Onion rings were very greasy but ok.  My friend had the same with fries... Those fries were soggy and bland (like the rest of it).  Waste of money!!  I told the owner who didn't seem to care at all.  I WON'T be back!!! Save your money and go elsewhere!! Burger Shack on Eglinton and Avenue Rd is a million times better!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it, I really did. We ordered souvlaki on a bun, cheeseburger, fries with gravy, onion rings, and 2 milkshakes. The souvlaki was the only good thing. The cheeseburger was boring and reminded me of a premade frozen patty. The fries were ok but it wasn't the dark brown gravy I saw pictured. It was lighter in colour and lacked depth in flavour. The onions rings looked delicious but the batter was a bit too heavy and the onions had a strong tang, like they had been soaked in vinegar or something. The milkshakes were disappointing too. I could crunch the ice flakes throughout and the strawberry one tasted more like bubblegum. Maybe they gave me the wrong one, but it just wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"I tried this place after a walk in the park. Customer service was a bit off and it was a surprise since it's a rare experience in most places that I try. The cashier guy was frowning while I was reading the menu in the 1st min I was in the store. There were two tables only occupied and 4 men working!  Clean washroom and tables.   I got the souvlaki dinner that had well grilled succulent cubes of chicken, around 7!  Half of the plate was covered in lettuce : Greek salad with a cheap watery oily dressing that lacked flavour.          And the other half in fries and onion rings. The Cost without tip around 15 $"}
{"text":"Calm down haters, Dairy Freeze is the best... or at least it's really good at being greasy and having rad retro crap and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.   Ridiculous conversations about Saturdays at Walmart (think Tuesdays With Morrie) with my dining companion aside, eating-in at Dairy Freeze was great fun. The booths are dated and cozy, and you have to move the pop-seats down yourself to sit on them, a la old movie theatre.   I had a soda, a poutine and a souvlaki pita. The poutine gravy was salty, dark and and runny... just how I like it, and the cheese was grated white crap. So good. Next time I'll get the burger like my pal did. If you do go for the burger, eat quickly so that your bun doesn't soak through. That's never fun.   PEPPER POINTS for all the grease. So. Tasty."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. When I entered, there was a girl leaning against the back counter, staring at the wall. She saw me, the guys in the kitchen saw me, but no one greeted me. So after looking at the display menu, I ask the girl, \"can I ask you a question\" and she said yes while still leaning at the back counter. It seemed like they were not interested in serving me. Didn't even ask me if I was eating in or taking out. So I made myself comfortable on my own and sat down.  I then ordered a gyro. The pricing and prep time was good. But the gyro was just blah! Very very average. I will not eat that again.   Even when I was leaving, the girl and a chef saw me, but didn't care to say thanks or bye or anything.  What an non welcoming group of people running this place. My suggestion: try another place around here"}
