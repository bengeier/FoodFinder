{"text":"Really disappointing. The last 2 times we have ordered, the pizza was soggy in the middle. We loved all of our pizza in the past, but this is not on par with previous orders. So, we called to let them know and their manager told us his delivery driver would be back to pick up the pizza and would give us our money back. Very disappointing, we won't order from meglios again."}
{"text":"Great pizza subs and wings. The sub rolls are fresh from Mancini. AWESOME. They delivered in the time they quoted and employees are super friendly"}
{"text":"Cheap, poor quality. The charge an extra $.75 for credit card use! Get with the 21st century!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices but  terrible service. Every time I have and order for delivery they are at least five minutes if not 20 or more minutes late... The drivers usually blame it on not being able to find the house (which I am not in a secluded or rough area tho navigate) or being understaffed. It's a little ridiculous... most often my orders are small too..ugh"}
{"text":"Terrible cardboard pizza. This crust is thin. The sauce was meh. Very little flavor for pizza. There is a reason why it is cheap pizza. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and great prices. Sometimes the pizzas are a little sloppy(not enough cheese, sauce everywhere), and we sometimes we don't get the things we request (no marinara sauce, extra ranch), but prices are so reasonable and someone pleasant always answers the phone. I think if they had better bread it would make me order here more often.   I feel that in a pizza shop, where you also sell hoagies, subs, calzones, and/or wedges, etc., you should first and foremost have good bread.   Sometimes I think when you order a delivery people get sloppy with what's under the box before they ship it off to your front door. Sometimes this happens at meglios as well but I'm willing to overlook a few sloppy mistakes for great service."}
{"text":"9/22/17 Calling and placing an order was easy. Payment over the phone with no complications.  Food arrived exactly when they said it would. Great amount of food for the price.  The food also tasted amazing and was the perfect temperature.  Ground and through, I give this place an A+++!!! Fast Forward to 11/4/17 I called and placed an order at 16:30. I am informed it will be 40 minutes to an hour for delivery, which is more than acceptable for a Saturday evening.  At 17:50, an hour and 20 minutes later, I started calling to see where my order was.  20 minutes of calling with no answer. So I make my own food, leftovers, and at 18:20 the driver shows up.  Really, an hour and 50 minutes? Food is room temperature and I asked what the delay was and I was informed it's a busy night.  Unacceptable.  We have always had great customer service and excellent food, but today proved us wrong.  I asked for the manager to call us and the driver took my number.  If I get a call, I would expect some form of compensation. If no call, no future business from us."}
{"text":"I always test a new pizza place that I try by its Sicilian pizza. I'm in love. Awesome crust, good distribution of toppings and not swimming in sauce. My sister got their white pizza and enjoyed it too... And she's super picky. Food arrived on time & the delivery guy was really nice.  Definitely ordering from this place again!"}
