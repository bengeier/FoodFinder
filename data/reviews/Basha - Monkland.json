{"text":"The falafel is very good, as is the tabbouleh salad and the poutine.  We had the shawarma poutine and it worked.  Haven't tried the chicken, as we were warned off by the several yelpers adamant about its dryness.  Pleasant terrasse and overall good service."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant. Finally a cheap fast food on west Monkland.  Long overdue

The quality of the food was really great and fast fresh turnover. The neighbourhood is ready for this and it shows. very popular already


Only critique is that they dont have the range of salads that i have come to expect from basha

still very fresh and nice"}
{"text":"Bien que ce restaurant soit drôlement situé, nous adorons nous y rendre pour y prendre des plats pour emporter. Nous sommes toujours servis par le propriétaire jusqu'à présent et il est très gentil. J'aime connaître les gens derrière les endroits que je fréquente. Côté nourriture, c'est toujours chaud, rapide et délicieux."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but you get a lot of it. They also cook things to order which is a plus. The chicken, however, is a bit dry and the service is what you expect from a fast-casual place, so it's a pretty good place to check out if you want some quick, fast, fairly good food."}
{"text":"The chicken is dry.   Every single time.   Been there 5 or 6 times and the chicken has been sitting out under the heater for ages.    Not enough sauce in the world to fix that.
The place is usually empty.  
I'd go to Amir (just a few blocks away on Sherbrooke) for a way better shish taouk pita any day."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star. I tried them out for the first time. The chicken is the driest i've ever had in my entire life. So dry and tasteless I had a hard time getting it down my throat. Never again. I'll stick to Boustan forever."}
{"text":"I've eaten at other Basha's before and have had mixed opinions.  This restaurant is weak in effort.  Salad dressing is bland and watery.  Portions are small for the price and equally bland.
I would not return."}
{"text":"Air climatisé l'été !! Nice :)))
Clean and savoureux :)
Petite terrasse. Ca depanne, why not?"}
