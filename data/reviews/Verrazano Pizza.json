{"text":"First time there got take out Pizza was very  and my boyfriend got the calzone was good will be going back in the near future.... My veggie pizza had the perfect amount of crispy crust. Will let my friends know thanks also for the best costumer service that anyone can ask fot6"}
{"text":"Ive been eating Verrazano pizza for years, 20 to be exact and enjoyed all of their food until today.  This place has really gone down  lately. They changed their sauce about a year ago, Ive been told and that is where the problem lies.  The chicken parm used to be the Bomb, no more. The sauce is now like jarred sauce, bitter and acidy. Today I decided to stay away  from the sauce and ordered the Chicken Philly, it's like they used the leftover gristtle, all hard and dry and full of grease. Went right through me if you know what I mean. Damn, now I'm going to have to find a new place! I think the owner Rick is cutting corners!"}
{"text":"So apparently there is another Verrazano location on Rainbow which has been around for about thirty years and is run by the same owner it opened with, who is himself a New York Italian. I made the mistake of thinking this was that. It's not that.

The pizza was not bad enough to send back, but bad enough to not finish. What I had today on a Saturday morning was a poseur of a slice. Yeah, it's thin and crispy enough to fold in half. No, it doesn't taste like a serious pizza chef made it. Couldn't tell who the chef was, but the only guy behind the counter was a young Hispanic guy. It tasted about as good as you'd expect if you went in thinking you'd get a thirty+ year veteran chef and got a young Hispanic guy instead.

Either today was a serious off day, or the five star reviews you're seeing on this page were meant to be written for the Verrazano on Sunset. I'm considering my five bucks a donation to a local business rather than money paid for a meal."}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up.I was greeted the moment I walked through the door. They have SUPERIOR Customer Service! The place was very clean. I like the feel of it.  I never been to New York, I felt like I was some where in NYC....I ordered a Meatball Parmigiana. It was really good. I think this is a great place to stop by on  a quick lunch break. Fast Service & Quality food for a Decent Price. I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My family are pizza lovers and were always trying new whole in the wall places because they useually have the best. This one is up in my top atm. We ordered lg cheese with mushrooms and 2 orders of frys. The sauce and dough were great although next time i might ask for it to be cooked a little longer. So I say yummm and definately worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, no  other pizza can compare, we eat it every Sat, for lunch .
Ed the owner  has owned the VZ for 28 years and still is there everyday serving up the food , Smells delicious when you walk in the doors."}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza need I say more. This place, Lefty's Pizzeria and Broadway Pizzeria are the top 3 places in Vegas for New York style pizza hands down. Like the vibe of this place little hole in the wall, great customer service and interaction. Pizza guy is a total character."}
{"text":"This pizza is off the wall delicious! I have been stopping here over the years for lunch mostly where you can get it by the slice.
Always a busy place for lunch but today I got here when they opened so I was second in line and of course the pizza rocked!"}
{"text":"Just happen to sit next to the owner at our favorite local pub on night. He and some other people were talking about his pizzeria and my boyfriend and I chimed into the conversation and so we decided to try it. We came in and were warmly greeted. 
OH-MY-LANTA THAT PIZZA IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Perfectly crisp. Thin, true N.Y. style crust. Oh man.. Cannot wait to indulge myself in this piece of divine heavenly pizza again.  The ONLY thing I would change are the freaking hours!! I'm off Mondays and they are closed and I get so bummed out. And when I'm craving this specific pizza late it's already closed! Blasted! Extend your hours Verrazano's!!"}
{"text":"Extremely good NY pizza, tasty every time and I've been eating here sine 1999, the cheese combination they use is so tasty and their sauce is light not so thick , I love their pizza even though some of their locations don't have a restroom their pizza is by far one of the best local secrets of local Vegas"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas!  Will make you never even think of going to Pizza Hut or other crappy chains again.  Something in the perfect blend of spices and cheeses, combined with perfect homemade crust...

Only drawback is it ain't cheap.  I paid 20 bucks for a large veggie.  They also don't have beer so get it to go!"}
{"text":"Living in the valley for over seven years now and still can't find a decent delivery pizza. While customer service was good and delivery was swift, the pizza fell extremely short. Had pepperoni and sausage. The pizza was very greasy and sorry, but I've had better in a cafeteria or food court. So we will keep on looking..."}

{"text":"Wow talk about being disappointed... I haven't eaten here in 3 years and boy did it go downhill... they changed the dough recipe .... It does not taste the same ... I know what I'm talking about  I owned 3 pizzerias in New York and my grandfather open up the second pizzeria in America totonos pizzeria in  Brooklyn New York.... Also there sauce is different. Very bland. To bad at one time they were right up there with the best of vegas..I knew something was different when I saw a big sign outside advertising one pizza for $6.99... Any really good pizzeria will not give there pizza away

{"text":"This is a great family owned pizza joint.  The decor is a little outdated and the tables a little smaller than I'd like, but I go for the pizza.  The owner Ed and his pizza chef, Kenny, know my family. I appreciate that.

Now the pizza.  It's really good! The crust is not too thin and not real thick. I'm not going to get into whether Chicago style or New York style is better because I think this qualifies as New York style.  In Las Vegas, we get people from both great cities and get to choose which style we want on any given day. 

I usually order the pepperoni pizza, an order of chicken wings plain, with hot wing sauce on the side. 

My kids are very picky, we usually can't agree on which major pizza chain we order from on late nights.  When we have time, we all agree on Verrazanos!   And the number one test for great pizza....leftovers.  It tastes good when it's cold."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas PERIOD.  
I've read reviews all over yelp from people ranting and raving about being from the east coast and how there's no good pizza in Vegas. Well that how we locals like it.  Keep on driving guys, nothing to see here..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 16 years. The best NY style pizza in the northwest of Vegas. Not spicy and no chunky sauce. (my pizza pet peeves) They'll cook it as you request and it always tastes the same. Great! Friendly staff.
Right, one of a few that sell Sicilian pizzas, but it will cost you. At least $20. They annualy raise the prices but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here.. we are from NY and just totally enjoy coming here for our pizza fix.. easy parking.. convenient location.. great people there"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, plenty of cheese, crispy crust and the staff is so nice. Good for quick lunch or to go orders. Our favorite neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, came upon this pizza place and so glad we did!! Welcomed by friendly staff then had some great pizza and antipasto salad. Pizza crust was some of the best I've had and the cheese and sauce were very flavorful!! Will remember this place when we come back into town!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I just went in recently and the older dude with an accent was a complete dick. They never have any slices ready. If you want shitty service, then this is your place."}
{"text":"I am rating this place a 5 because of their great customer service. The pizza was delicious and I would give it 4 stars.

Went last night with a friend, ordered a medium veggie pizza with two sodas. They took the pizza to our table and it was really good! Thin, crispy, and hot! An older gentleman took napkins, offered us cheese and pepper and put them on our table -without us having to ask. As well as refills. They seem to care about their customers. To be honest I love pizza and I've tried a lot but their pizza was good especially their crunchy crust. Not to mention that nothing was burned or over/under cooked either. Nice friendly & attentive :)"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas. I've lived here for two years and mad I only just discovered it recently."}
{"text":"Been going here atleast once a week as it is a popular lunch spot for me and my workers. 

Food: Being from NY, I must say that this pizza is pretty darn close folks. We're never gonna find our favs out here, but in terms of style, amount of ingredients, etc, this is on the money. 

Staff: Good ol' boys from NY, always very accomodating and nice. We sometimes have few people with us and they help with moving tables together, etc. 

Ambiance - reminds me of the 'on every block' pizza places in nyc. Has some seating, has a tv on. Has a walk up counter where you order and they will bring it to you if you are staying in. 

Price: Normally don't talk much about price, however they are super cheap compared to the other pizza places. Slices and pies 

All-in-all, I could come here anytime, lunch or dinner. Never really seen a line, so it is worth stopping by for a quick slice to try out!!"}
{"text":"This place is great love the service very friendly home atmosphere keep up the good work guys. Food is awesome never any complaints. Highly recommended this place to all my family and friends. I've been a customer for 10 years now and plan on going for another 10"}
{"text":"Didn't even order. The guy on the phone didn't even want to give me the time of day. I was asking for specials and prices and he said he didn't have time for me he was busy.  Call back when I'm ready. I ask if he has a website so I can check what they have and he said no. How am I supposed to be ready if I have no idea what's on your menu. Rude very rude. Bad customer service they need to work on that ASAP... I may try again later and I'll give another review but that was not a good start.. I can't even place a order without having bad customer service.."}
{"text":"great classic Vegas pizza place.  Growing up, it seemed like there were plenty of these kinds of places with great pizza, great chicken fingers, great wings, french fries, etc.   Now it seems like most places skimp on the quality of ingredients.  

The portions are large, the toppings are plentiful and full of flavor.  The chicken fingers are great, the ranch tastes fresh, and the fries are good traditional pizza fries."}
{"text":"Best in town! Similar to the flamingo location but different and the crew (mainly Ed the owner n Kenny) make the place fun making jokes and talking like a barbershop, place is old but makes it a unique classic joint. Don't ever waste your money at these cheap low quality chains #shopsmallbiz"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been coming here for years. He says its closest to pizza back home (east coast) he has found out here.  Everything we have a tried on the menu has been delicious.  They also remember their regulars, always nice and polite.  Also their ranch sauce is seriously good, always have to get an extra."}
{"text":"Every single thing here is seriously delicious. And they have a stellar lunch special. Not to mention it smells like heaven as soon as you walk in the door. So good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, a good variety of different foods. Pizza is really good. The chicken fingers were my favorite in town, until they changed the recipe, but still pretty good."}
{"text":"There are others in the business who claim to be better, and this pizza is always awesome.  I order almost once a week, and it always rules.  Their homemade ranch sauce is the best!  Not an oily pizza, either.  When you lift your piece off, the cheese is real and stays in place, and there's no 'oil spill' under the slice.  Love them, and REASONABLY PRICED THE BEST PART!  Always on time and friendly, too.  Wish they were open on Mondays, though......would be great with MNF! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good! First time just a pep nothing else look forward to testing out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"the worst customer service in vegas!! also found a hair in my pizza!! do not order from this place!! disgusting and owner is extremely rude."}
{"text":"Not bad. Best as a decent take out. Crust was too hard but a good taste. Dining room is a few booths and tables and was not air-conditioned very well but hay, your there for the pizza and garlic knots."}
{"text":"I have been going to Verrazano Pizza for years and I consistently get fantastic pizza. If you want real NY style pizza with generous sizes, this is the place. The guys that work there have a great attitude and always treat me great. They also have the best ranch salad dressing in town, although I don't get why my kids always want to dip their pizza in it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very nice staff too! The chicken fingers are my fav and the garlic knots, yumm!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! The pizza I got was cooked perfectly and had tons of great flavor. I wasn't sure of the service when I walked in, but the atmosphere was pretty good and it wasn't too expensive. A great meal."}
{"text":"Love this pizza. Best in Vegas.  As a New Yorker, I think that's all I have to say.  (Good wings too)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Got a lg calzone: too much ricotta and barely any mozzarella... cut it open and the inside ran out like soup. Very skimpy on the toppings, especially for $1 each extra. Marinara sauce is mediocre at best...too many chunks of onions and veggies like spaghetti sauce, not pizza sauce. $15 for a large calzone...could've had 2 lg pizzas elsewhere.  Try another place."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Being from Chicago, I swear the square slices on the Sicilian size give it that something special.  Always nice on the phone.  A great find."}
{"text":"I really like Verrazano's. The pizza is delicious (for west coast pizza). When ordering delivery the crust could be crispier but other than that we enjoy everything we have tried on the menu."}
{"text":"The pizza is average just typical Las Vegas pizza nothing special.  The delivery was horrible.  The driver comes to my door the bill is $22 I only have $40 the driver says he don't have change and is just expecting the whole $40.  Can you explain to me how a delivery driver has no change for a $20.  The feel at the door was that I felt like I was being hustled.  I send the food back and refuse to order from there again.  I called the store and spoke with the manager and he never apologized nothing the entire experience sucked."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers fried hard, pepperoni pizza and that ranch.... Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for many years. The pizza is great and so are the chicken fingers.  All the guys that work there are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the pepperoni pizza and a Philly cheesesteak w/ fries today and both were great!! Authentic NY style pizza and the cheesesteak was very tasty! I got onions and peppers on my cheesesteak and I also had ranch to dip my fries and sandwich in. The wait time is long because they actually make the food fresh when you order it, which is a great thing and very well worth it."}
{"text":"Everyone naturally loves the food they grew up with, and for me one of those foods is NY style pizza.  So I've been on a hunt since arriving here in Las Vegas to find a pizzaria that will bring me back home for a little while - and I found it today!

We ordered a large pepperoni - they had a special so we paid the same amount as for a medium pie (awesome!), and an order of hot wings.  The decor is not fancy - just a long aisle with booths.  It reminded me of a lot of places back East, no frills, but practical.  

The wings were normal, this is not the dish that will bring me back.  The clear and definite winner was the pizza!!!  It had an amazing crust, foldable but crisp on the bottom, so good that I even ate the ends (I usually leave them behind).  The sauce was tasty and the cheese was high quality, long gooey strings every time we picked up a new piece from the serving plate.  The amount of pepperoni was good.  It was just really good, soul satisfying pizza!

PS: they have a lunch special every day until 3pm where you get two slices and a drink for $4.75.  You can add toppings at 25 cents each one.  A nice low commitment way to see if this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Beware this place is stuck in the stone age couldn't find my address after giving it to them twice and spelling it slowly like a child I am blown away by the incompetents of this place and how can you really trust somebody who can't even find an address in this day in age so I told them no I'm not going to pay $45 for some cold food so if you're looking for some pizza or fingers or wings for that matter this is not the place because they count 1 + 1 is 5 & I can't trust that"}
{"text":"We got the Verrazano pizza, garlic knots, and plain chicken wings.  First off the pizza was good.  It was greasy but the meats on it were delicious.  

Garlic knots were not that great.  It was burnt and dry.  

Chicken wings were also Ok.  We got plain which I would think it would at least be seasoned with salt but it literally was plain no flavor.  So we ordered some ranch to give it some flavor. 

Customer service was alright."}
{"text":"Great food and equal service.  This place kind of reminds me of what the ideal New York pizzeria should look and feel.  I'll definitely return there."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. The employees are always nice and while the dining area can be hot (it is small and there is a GIANT pizza oven 10 ft away) it is a pretty relaxed environment. If you're a regular, they do recognize you-which is rare. I haven't been to their other location but this one is great."}
{"text":"been going here off and on for years. same guys working there, very friendly.  I love that they kick people out if their pants are hanging too low!"}
{"text":"Tonight, 7/30/16, I had been calling for 30 minutes trying to place an order for pickup. The phone was apparently left off the hook so you got a busy signal. Then with 7 minutes till 9 it's placed on the hook and it rings until you get an answer machine. Pulled up 5 minutes before they are supposed to be closed but the place is empty and the worker is pulling away. 
I get that it's a Saturday night, but when a customer calls well before closing and is willing to drive across town for your food why would you not want that business. In my opinion this was the act of the employees who decided to stop working at least 30 minutes early. If this an acceptable policy at this place that is horrible customer service and will cause you to loose my further business. I hope that is not the case and the appropriate individuals are reprimanded."}
{"text":"Under new management
What a way to ruin an excellent establishment. We have been customers of Verrazano's for years, but tonight was the end of that relationship. 
The pizza was smaller and the crust tasted like cardboard with tomato sauce on it. It was worse than school pizza. The wings were supposed to be medium and extra crispy, they were not. Our food has always been ready on time, but tonight we waited an additional 20 minutes. To top it off the new management has decided to charge 3% if you choose to use you debit/credit card. This is no longer the Verrazano's we loved."}
{"text":"Pizza is SO SO SO GOOD. Some of the BEST NY style pizza I've had on the west coast. The SAUCE is seasoned, obviously someone's special recipe. Crust is thin but still crispy, yeah you can fold it. Pasta is BOMB also but every time I order I have to get pizza. Try the calzones-pretty damn authentic. It brings back nostalgic tastes of home."}
{"text":"Just because it says NY.......

This pizza shop is clean, and the staff is friendly, but you don't go for pizza because of these things do you?

I found the crust on these big New York style slices to be perfectly crispy and light.  Other than that, I didn't like a thing about this pizza.

The sauce tasted a bit watered down, and the cheese was bland.  I ended up drowning my slice in crushed red pepper and parmagiano just to taste something.  

I wanted to like Verrazano Pizza, but couldn't get past the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza.  My family and I always order a large pepperoni pizza chicken fingers and wings. So good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat a somewhat late dinner, and you're craving pizza, Verrazano's hits the spot. Came here with a buddy an hour before they closed and got a large pizza and wings special for $20. The tables, floor, bathrooms, etc. are outdated, but they do an excellent job of keeping the place clean. The staff is very friendly also. 

My uncle treated me here once a couple years ago, and I guess I forgot how good this place was. I'm definitely coming here more often!"}
{"text":"K Foodies, If your looking for a great NY pizza, this is the joint for you! No hoopla, no frills, just great pizza!!! Order the pepperoni or just plain old cheese, you wont be disappointed...promise!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We make it our 1st meal whenever were in town. It's consistently good and we have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"For a \"hole in the wall\" type of place, their pizza is fantastic!  Then again, ask any New Yorker and they'll likely tell you that's always the best.  Verrazano's has it goin on!  Start with the crust, the foundation of any great pizza.  Their crust is simply delicious and always done just right!  I have never had it burnt or doughy.  Then the sauce.  Delicious.  All those things, a great pizza make and that's just what you'll get here."}
{"text":"Great New York style pie and wings with fantastic service. Well done. There is a reason why they have been open for 30 years. This is coming from a pizza slut"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Customer service is OK. sort of. 

I came in for lunch with a friend. We had no idea what to expect, so of course I check the reviews and I see they got great ones!  So, we decided to check it out.  I stood for a while staring at the menu because I didn't know what to order. It wasn't that there were too many or too little amount of items to choose from, but they all sounded delicious. I decided on 1 slice of mushroom pizza and the lunch special chicken wings. It was a pretty good deal.  My friend's food came out first. She ordered the meatball sub and fried ravioli.  (The ravioli appetizer is to die!) My slice of pizza finally came out but I didn't want to start eating until all my food was ready... Waiting.... Waiting.. Waiting............ My wings took forever!!! I ended up taking a few bites of my pizza while I wait for the rest. Pizza was amazing!!! Crust. Perfect. Cheese. Perfect. Mushrooms. Perfect. I usually dip my pizza in ranch but I didn't even need it. With the pizza almost done.. STILL waiting on wings. My friend finished eating before my food even came out; such an inconvenience!  I would give this place more stars if I didn't have to wait so long just for an order of chicken wings. Did they have to hunt down the chicken first?"}
{"text":"A favorite in our family!  Pizza is sooooo good!  Thin and delish!  The people who wirk there make you feel like family!  I haven't yet ordered anything besides pizza...YET!!!  (:"}
{"text":"They have been around since I was in grade school.... And STILL come to eat there. They are HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE pizza place!!!! AMAZING NY STYLE... BETTER than the rest!!!"}
{"text":"The relaxed atmosphere was the first thing I noticed about this place. This is a no-nonsense pizzeria. Simple anesthetics and good food. I had the chicken parmesan sub, one of the best I've ever had. You should swing by this place if you can."}
{"text":"EUREKA I FOUND IT! After some bad experiences with other nearby pizza places, I finally found the bomb.com meatball sandwich! The bread was soft yet crispy, meatballs big and flavorful, and Oh-em-gee the cheese. The last place I ordered a meatball sub from didn't even give it to cheese, but Verrazano made up for it with deliciously melted mozzarella. The fried ravioli appetizer was delish too. My friend got the hot wings that I didn't try, but the hot sauce smelled AMAZEBALLS and made my mouth water. We finally found the spot for our lunch time marinara cravings."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best NY style pizza in Las Vegas.  I've been to most independent places in the city and nothing comes close."}
{"text":"Best pizza shop in town! My husband and I always come here and they're all very friendly and extremely attentive, they make us feel like family and their food is delicious always hot and  fresh"}
{"text":"All the Bonanza High kids went here, so when I, or other Western High kids got some, it was like scoring a white castle or something. Great pizza, yummy garlic ranch and wings, friendly staff, quick service. No more quarter TVs, though, lol."}
{"text":"Use to be a great place to dine in chill as a former employee it was great work environment we were all family here until original owner Phil Ruffino broke his promise to us that we would be first ones considered if the business was for sale to have a chance to purchase it so we stayed loyal to him for 5 plus years then he sells it under us without even informing us until we see mail of new ownership and the  schmucks came in trying make it known prior to transfer ownership starting stuff and got one of our drivers fired which was loyal to the business and then we lost some customers due to his loss and lost chris our best pizza maker - manager then the place went Down hill after the  schmucks took it over month ago changing up the recipes which for 40 years it's been the same cause our motto is it never sucked and then trying fire the original crew which we all quit because of new owner Ryan shady business taking out taxes federal medical and social from our paychecks without even knowing our social security to pay the taxes he taking out and charging our loyal customers the tax price and adding tax on top . Business became shady so we all left before IRS and stuff comes in for shady business and sad all our customers now get charged the merchant fee for using credit card. This new guy is savage on taxing customers all types of hidden fees. To all our loyal customers that knew me Carlos Antonio Chris Jose Sean we all appreciate your loyalty and for not coming back there after we all departed we are in process of opening our own shop shortly to keep recipe the same the real New York Brooklyn style pizza y'all known for last 40 years in Las Vegas. Sad how new ownership turned this place from a friends and family style environment that our customers loved to just a regular type business style place like a dominos or pizza hut.  Help boycott this place and make this guy bankrupt like his last business for being a shady pos  schmuck"}
{"text":"Sooooooo sad Verrazano Pizza is gone!!!!!! I miss this place soooo much I don't know what happened, one day I'm ordering pizza and the next I call and it's some other pizza place! Man I miss their ranch, it was really something special."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the hype is about. They have a decent lunch special of two slices and a drink for $5, but what I received was wet, limp, and gross. I couldn't tell if the pizza was undercooked, intended to be a Neopolitan style (doubtful) or simply drowning in lackluster sauce and grease, but I barely nibbled one slice and tossed the other.  Too many great pizza places in town to justify this one being open or having a four-star rating."}
{"text":"I stop in every time I come to Las Vegas. The pizza is great and the sausage and ranch are the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive from the strip. I have sampled many different pizza places in Vegas. This is as close to NY style as you're going to get. This review comes from a native New Yorker."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken strips were awesome and they have a homemade ranch i loved. Also got a pizza pie with everything.. real cheese! Crust was super crispy for having all those toppings"}
{"text":"This place has been a staple for our family, typically order to go and have family time at home! The pizza is amazing wings are delish, you really can't go wrong with this place. Lunch specials are super reasonable and 2 slices are huge! The staff is always friendly and personable. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, just like NYC.My favorite is the Sicilian, 20 bucks but it is worth it.For me the best two pizza places in Vegas are this one and Cugino's."}
{"text":"I told myself a few years ago I wouldn't go back. I gave you one more shot. Never again! 
Meatball sandwich had two, two meatballs cut in half to make a sandwich. Cheap Fu*cks! All for $8.0."}
{"text":"I had just tried this place on my daughters recommendation and needless to say it was excellent they must go"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Pizza is great, service is great. Sometimes you have to wait a little bit but I don't mind cause we love the pizza. We would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only is the pizza awesome, but the service is amazing. I'm from Brooklyn and this is really the closest you can get to NY pizza in Vegas. I got a large cheese pizza and a calzone and both were cheesy and wonderful. And the man the delivered to me was quite a gentleman. I will not only be back but I will tell everyone about it. Just all around great."}
{"text":"My girlfriend goes to the massage therapy school M-F from 7-1030 & im visiting from TX so of course I wait to see her whenever I can.  So today I was craving Pizza as her daughter had mentioned it before we left for her to go to school.  So seeing and I thought I try them out and boy was I not disappointed.  I got the anchovy by the slice and pepperoni by the slice and both were truly amazing deathly try this place out.  Not to mention the gentleman that worked the counter was extremely nice and was open to any questions I had concerning what they offered."}
{"text":"First time eating here today. The pizza was fabulous.  We got pepperoni and sausage.  It was nice and foldable. Have the perfect amount of greese and cheese and the best was the sausage and pepperoni.  The two meats went well together.  Not too spice but not bland. I will for sure be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The best slice on the planet. I go back here as often as I can. Every time I'm in vegas I'm looking to stop by"}
{"text":"Literally a slice of New York in Las Vegas!!!! Man I love this place !  I feel like I'm in Brooklyn getting a slice with my homies except the weather is nicer lol!!! I definitely recommend this place the food is awesome and the prices are great!!! Come on down !!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars the pizza is the closest your going to get to East Coast Pizza. This is on my top two places to order pizza and the best part? $11.99 pick up Cheese Pizza Pie special!!! A lot of places charge you $20 and up for a pie that tastes like crap. You will not be sorry if you come here. They are from Boston and I'm from Jersey so we are like cousins haha! Every Time I come in I feel right at home. They have s good sense of humor hence on the door theres a sign that reads \"no sagging pants in the restaurant\" nice and old school just how I like it. Some folk are very sensitive out here in Vegas but I like it just fine. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and found this place on yelp. I love NY style pizza and this reminds me of that. I would recommend this place. Plenty of booths to sit at inside. Everything was priced right as well. I don't live there, but if I did this would become a regular for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch since it's close to new office. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The pizza was great too!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, but I could do without the racist comments, especially when children are present"}
{"text":"I love the New York style pizza here!!! If you haven't tried it, you've got to!! One of my favorite pizza spots I've grown up eating!! I'm not a huge Ranch/on my pizza pie, but my buddies swear by their secrete recepe here! The Buffalo Chicken Strips taste so great and just being here brings back memories..."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Verrazano's pizza. I used to go to the one on rainbow on Trop, and today I have an asked Siri for food near me and this location popped up. It gave me nostalgia so I decided to go in. I asked if they had personal pizzas and the man let me know nicely that they had a special for two slices & a drink for 5.25 + tax. I decided to go with that and the food was good I got plain cheese pizza & I liked it. The guy who was helping me was super nice by the way he has glasses and blue eyes. Since he was so nice I tipped him an extra two bucks. If I happen to be in the area again I will come back here :)"}
{"text":"Growing up, we couldn't afford Verrazano's... But they do have great lunch specials. The pizza is awesome... but the hidden star is the ranch dressing, the best. I tried the manicotti with a side of meatballs- so good!! Love places in my neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas we have had from take out the ziti pizza is THE BOMB. Creamy sauce, chewy and crunch dough with a yummy crust......ultimate comfort pizza.......now all I need to do is find somewhere that makes a mac and cheese pizza......hint hint."}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping center as this place, and finally decided to try it today. My boyfriend grew up eating at their sister store, and always loved it. So, I decided to order some hot chicken fingers and fries. I was so sad and disappointed when I got back to work and saw they put almost NO sauce on the fingers! They're just not good. Then, to top it off, there's literally no salt on the fries. I don't indulge very often, so this was a special treat, and I'm extremely disappointed. I don't have time to take it back, since I'm on break. But, I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I miss new york.  I miss the pizza.  most pizza sucks in vegas.   Firstly it a pizza place, just like in new york, it got a few tables but i prefer to take mine home.  So we all know the true test  of a new york pizza is the \"pie.\"  For those that dont know  a \"pie\" is a cheese pizza.  If you want to know if a place is good you get the pie and a side of meatballs.

So I did.  And it was heaven.   If i had known the meatballs were going to be so good i would have gotten two orders.


EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE EVEN LIVED IN NYC AND MISS REAL PIZZA AND OR MEATED BALLS!!!!!


5 is lot of stars,  its pretty damn good though"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good but the customer service was terrible. It was one of those places where you liked the food but the customer service was so bad that you never want to go back. I even placed an order for take-out and still felt mistreated. The girl at the counter made me feel like I ruined her day by placing an order. Seemed like she hated her job and took it out on me. If you don't like your job than quit and let someone with the effort to be pleasant take your job, there are plenty of willing people out there considering the unemployment rate here in Las Vegas. 

Bottom line: The food was good but will not return because I was treated very poorly.

Note to Mgmt: Send a secret shopper to find out how your employees treat patrons."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.I started going to this place in 1995 when I only loved 2 blocks away.  I moved way to the other side of town and wasn't over on that side anymore.  Well, last week, I had an appointment near Verrazono and decided, why not, haven't been there in years.
This place never disappoints.The pizza was as good as I can remember.  Being from NY.hey what can I say.,,awesome pizza.
Believe me, not staying away for long anymore.

A pie to go please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

."}
{"text":"About as close as your gonna get with NY style pizza. This place is fire. 2 slices and a soda will put a nice smile on your face for the day."}
{"text":"Went to Verrazano Pizza today for lunch, and the service was great! The gentleman behind the counter was very polite and kept coming over to ask if we needed anything and offered us refills on our drinks. Not bad considering I paid the same amount for my meal that I would have for a cheap fast food lunch! Good job Verrazano, I will be returning for lunch again!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for the last 3 yrs & this my 1st review. This review will be on \"Pizza\" only. Being in the restaurant business I have tasted so many different pizzas. For me & my family Verrazano's pies are excellent, pizza is simple & sometimes simple is the best."}
{"text":"Tasty, but some of the greasiest pizza I've ever seen. Literally orange it was so greasy. 
Also, the delivery driver didn't carry cheese or peppers with him because they are \"by request only\"

So at least now we know that 1, we need to request cheese or peppers when we order and 2, we should find out what's up with the grease and see if they can do something about that."}
{"text":"I recently tried Verrazano Pizza hoping that it would take me back to my hometown, Brooklyn N.Y.  The pizza was very good- crisp crust, gooey cheese and foldable.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. This has become my favorite pizza spot in town. I always get sausage and cheese. I know the hot wings are great and we are trying out the garlic knots tonight. 

We just did a pick up order, it was fast and fresh out of the oven! Smells amazing!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Really good food for reasonable prices. The ownership cares about their customers which will always bring my family back. Thanks again for a great meal and a genuine caring for excellent service!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza joint! The ingredients are always fresh and the pizza taste amazing! Definitely will recommend"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! Verrazano Pizza not only has delicious, authentic food but the service is stellar. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here thinking it was still Verrazano Pizza. Very disappointed to hear it's been taken over by new owners. I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni for pick up. Got home and they gave me two pieces of cheese. It looked very unappealing. I immediately took it back. The new place is called IDK Craft Pizza or something?  DO NOT GO HERE. YUCK."}
{"text":"The BF is very picky with his pizza and love NY thin crust style! Verrazano Pizza is so delicious that it reminds us of NYC! 

Great tasting and huge pizzas! Even though we live close to Mountain's edge, they will even deliver to our house!"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this place (delivery) since it was close and got good reviews. I have to say it was some of the worst pizza I've had in a while. I would easily prefer digiorno over this. The toppings were bland and the pizza dough was very hard and stale tasting. Unfortunate since I was really hoping it would be good with how close it is."}
{"text":"The pizza is great!!! Quality and flavor is always on point!!! Dining room is always clean! Staff is friendly, although one man can be a bit obnoxious and loud. We enjoy coming here!! Great food, always satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from CA, been looking for a REAL NY PIZZA place here in Vegas and this place is LEGIT NY PIZZA! The places on the strip is a joke except for the one on the 1st floor of New York, New York. But if youre on the look out. Look no more. Kenny and the staff is awesome. Felt like I was back in NY/NJ again."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn and am very picky about pizza.  I've tried a lot of pizza places here in Las Vegas and by far this is my favorite place.  Nothing outside of NYC will ever be as good, but in my opinion, this place comes as close as you can."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. I'm from NY/NJ and it's very difficult to find good pizza out here. I highly recommend Verrazano's!!  They all know me and what I eat. It's just like back home. ( just make sure your pants aren't sagging when you go in!! )"}
{"text":"Here is another one of my top places for pizza delivery. I have decided only to rate my favorite places on yelp. And this pizza joint is one of the best. I order the large cheese and fingers with ranch. I have read some of the one star reviews and have to say \"REALLY\"??? Come on Man!!!! Don't order stupid things like meatballs. It is a PIZZA Joint! Not a Meatballs Joint! Come on everyone who 1 stars business that specialize in Pizza but get  1 stars for stupid things like meatballs. Use some common sense. Got a nice local Italian place like the Bootlegger for meatballs."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, this is delicious greasy new york style pizza. Our first pizza joint when we first moved here, they deliver and satisy that urge for greasy cheesy pizza! I would not waste your money on teh wings, they are not very good but their garlic knots are pretty good is they have any left when you are ordering your food. I heard they have great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Lovelovelove this place.  

It's not for everyone though.  This is a NY/NJ style pizzeria.  You don't go here to eat-in unless you're stopping for a few slices at lunch.  Its the kind of place you went to when you cut gym senior year of high school.  The kind of place where you smell the ovens from outside and there's always an employee/family member sitting at one of the tables folding boxes.  If I remember right its owned by some guys from Staten Island.

I hadn't been here in a long time since moving out of GV, but now I work in the area so I stopped in for lunch.  They have a good lunch special ($4.95/ 2 slices and a drink).  The pizza was a little overdone but was still better than most of the shitty pizza here in the valley. 

I used to order stuffed shells and some other dishes and everything was always top notch.  This is Italian food made by Italians.

All in all one of the better joints in town."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm sub, fries, and a large cheese pizza. Chicken parm sandwich was good, it wasn't amazing it was just good. The pizza was also just average. The BF loved the parm sandwich. Would order again but maybe something different or a pizza with pep."}
{"text":"This place is a pizza-gem in Las Vegas. I'm a regular here for lunch- 2 slices of cheese and a drink for less than $5. The cheese pizza is awesome, perfect amount of crisp to the dough and never overly greasy. The fried raviolis are a must have extra to any order. They come with marinara sauce and about 10 in each order. This place is family owned with friendly faces every time. The delivery times are quick and pick up is always on time. I've also order the lasagna pizza and Hawaiian- but these order were a little overwhelming with the toppings which made the pizza a little difficult to handle. Classic cheese or pep is the way to go."}
{"text":"I love the pizza.  This place has great pizza.  I have been coming here for years.  My friend took me to this place and now I bring my friends here.  The wings are ok but they could be better.   The chicken fingers are pretty good.  The best part is they both come with the French fries and they are really good.  They have other great food  choices like sandwiches and garlic bread.  The crew works well together and makes it very welcoming.  If you love pizza then you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Half toppings not counting for one whole topping for pizza is a win! We were able to order and essentially create our own pizza for only 17.99 (4 toppings total). A large, might I add. We also ordered zucchini sticks and mild seasoned wings (came with fries)!  

It was all delicious! Definitely would come again! The price may or may not be only for pick up. We ordered there and ate it at home."}
{"text":"Come here ALOT. Been coming here on weekends with the family's for years now. Love all the workers here they all know us by name and know exactly what were going to order every time they see us walking in. We always have the big table in the back due to a big family. Definately top five pizza joint in the Valley. thanks for making it possible. Only recommendation is that they upgrade the TV in there. seems a bit old and have to squint while i'm watching the games. anywho im very happy with it."}
{"text":"Very accurate new york style pizza. I am from brooklyn new york and this place does not disappoint. I was surprised that they sell pizza by the slice because I never see that outside of new york. The pizza is exactly as they advertise it. Even the interior atmosphere really reminds me of new york. They have the same kind of picnic benches that are in pizzarias in new york. Overall it was a really nostalgic experience and well worth the price. 

I would recommend this place if you like new york style of pizza."}
{"text":"Its been awhile since ive been to Verrzanos. Dont know why i waited so long to return. Pizza was excellent like it always has been. The fingers were cooked perfect and the ranch was spot on. The only little complaint i have is the hot sauce had just a lil bit to much vinegar. Other then that everything was great"}
{"text":"Well what can I say! Really good pizza!! People are friendly and great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a solid little neighborhood  pizza joint. Cheap, fresh, and quick pies. Guy behind the counter is really nice. Always asks me if I want a drink while I wait for my pizza. Haven't had any apps except mozzarella stix but they are good too. This place is a great option when I don't feel like cooking on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Great pizza but absolutely rude customer service. I walked in after calling and they completely ignored us and all three were working or doing something at the front while standing straight in front of them. He was rude older man who just looked up after five minutes said hello as if we are intruding and turns around and continues until about 5min standing there says can I help you. Ugh."}
{"text":"Yum ! First time trying this place out after working in the next plaza for a year. Service was great and the food is good with big portions. I came on a Friday late afternoon and wasn't super busy so service was quick too."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint.  NY style..thin cheesy with just the right amount of grease :-)
Owned, operated and prepared by real Italians...plus one.
Cheap lunch specials...plus two.
Convenient to get to...plus three.
Reminds me of home...winning.
Don't go in here expecting fancy/trendy decor.  Do go in here expecting great service and pizza.  What else do you really need when looking for a slice?  I'm not here to schmooze and be noticed, I'm here to eat!  I'm giving this place 5 stars based on the above taking into account it's not a date night kind of place...but it is 100% what I expected and enjoy.

NOTE:  Not open on Sunday or Monday!  Plan ahead."}
{"text":"Much better this time.
Although a bit pricey, as compared to other local options, the pizza was fantastic and the wings great, even better than the pizza!  
I'm a fan now."}
{"text":"Their pizza isnt bad but they're jerks when you come in late. We are 30 mins before closing n dude talks shit n then tells some people to go away. We are getting this shit to go. I understand you wanna go home but it's fuckin 830. Make some money n stfu."}
{"text":"After my cousin who use to live here raved so much about this place when she came to visit this past weekend we had planned a lunch date here. It has been 8 years since she has been here and one bite in she said it tasted just like she remembered.
Now there were 4 of us so we got a large half cheese and half pepperoni pizza. The man behind the counter doing pro pizza tosses (very impressive!) advised us to go with a classic cheese pizza with no toppings because toppings spoil the pizza. He took our order and gave us our drinks and we sat down at one of the booths they offer and watched a football game and caught up. As soon as the pizza came out I was loving the fact that it was thin crust. true new york style. large slices that you need to fold to stuff in your face. I will say that we should have gone with the employees recommendation of just cheese. The grease from the pepperoni did ruin the pizza a little and took over the flavor. the crust was amazing that nobody left it on their plate. It reminded me a place I use to go out to in Long Island when I was away from the city and I think that it another reason I thought so fondly of this place.
The prices are great, the employees were friendly and funny, and the pizza left us stuffed and happily satisfied."}
{"text":"The only bad thing living in NY is I am spoiled from the great tasting food they have there and that's why most of my reviews I knock places here in Vegas because I am spoiled. So when I give 5 stars to a pizza joint which I rarely do, you know I am one happy camper. Try this place out, trust me you will not be disappointed.



Now review on this NEW and Improved Verrazanos WOW! Thank you Ryan for taking over this place, the pizza from old owners here was terrible, I live right around the corner and I would have to travel 5 miles to get decent pizza with this NEW owner that took over (RYAN) , guys let me tell you this, from living in NYC all my life, and tasting the best pizza, this place is for sure hands down best pizza I ever tasted living here in Vegas, I also have buddy's that lived in NY, and Chicago they told me about the great tasting pizza they have here and they are RIGHT! Everything here is made from scratch, no frozen stuff in here, the tomato sauce Home made and man can you taste the different. The owner Ryan is a great guy, Ryan is not New to making pizzas, being a New Yorker him self Ryan food is excellent he takes pride in what he does, and guys it shows, it really does.

Now that I found a great pizzeria here in Vegas, can I now find one of those Mom and pop pastry shops they have in NY, man I miss them"}
{"text":"Found this place because we were so hungry and it was on the way home. So glad we grab some pizza. Friendly people and great pizza! Definitely, a great stop to grab some pizza!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for decades always very consistent great sandwiches and their chicken fingers are awesome.... They always have some kind of special going on that will get you a ton of food for not so much dough:)"}
{"text":"Years of searching in Vegas, and a coupon in Val Pak introduced me to the best pizza in town!  This Verrazano, at Rainbow and Westcliff, is excellent!  I'm  a serious foodie, and the pizza is delicious and priced very well.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in New York. Go every year and always have pizza cause I figure it will be the last New York Pizza until I get back. Been out on west coast for 50 years. Happen to be in Smiths center and thought I'd try a slice of cheese, the true test of new York style pizza. Could not believe it. Was exactly like New York. Sauce, cheese, crust! I thought I was having a hallucination! Will be back to try the Italian sausage and meatballs.
THANK YOU LORD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good at all we tried this place 2 times it's horrible the mozzarella sticks are frozen I do get places use frozen stuff but plz cook them right the pizza it's crazy bad you are better off with Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"I just love that specialty spinach ricotta pizza!"}
{"text":"Location is Eastern and Windmill in the Smith's Shopping Center. Lots of people walking into this place (good sign!) The sign out front advertised a large cheese pizza special for $9.99 (sweet deal!) Always skeptical of reviewers saying pizza tastes like New York pizza. I get excited just to be disappointed but the pizza was pretty good and it is close to the pizza you get in New York. Look forward to trying EVERYTHING on the menu. So happy we found this place THANKS FELLOW YELPERS!!"}
{"text":"Pizza reminds me of East Coast pizza. Mice size and fairly priced. Delivery took about 10mins longer than predicted."}
{"text":"I have been getting pizza here since the 1990s, and it has been great, until my visit yesterday. Not only was the crust of my large pizza cardboard hard (it tasted like old dough), they were very stingy on the toppings.  I was very disappointed, considering this place charges $18 for a large pizza! That's $8 more than Pizza Hut.  The lady at the counter didn't make my experience any better.  She never said, \"Hello,\" and she wasn't friendly/happy/smiling.  I'm giving this place 3 stars for the sauce and cheese on the pizza, both were ok."}
{"text":"Ryan and his crew awesome customer service..great food   My favorite the chicken wings.."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and they have the closest pizza to home!! Best Pizza in town!! Tell them Italiano sent you and they will probably tell you a crazy story or two about me!! The owner works hard and the pizza is perfecto every time. With their homemade garlic ranch they are killin the game!!"}
{"text":"The ranch is the best thing here! The people working here aren't the friendliest but the pizza is pretty good, ESPECIALLY dipped in their ranch. They dont have a restroom for customers, you would have to walk all the way across the parking lot to smiths if you really got to go. Not really an ideal situation when you come to eat with smaller children."}
{"text":"We lived in NYC for a decade and this place really captures the NY style pizza.  Even the spirit of the place feels like the divey NYC pizza pie joints.  We were there in July and they need to turn on the air conditioning.  Still if you don't need a fancy restaurant or even a charming restaurant and all you want is that NY pizza taste, this is the place."}
{"text":"Good food and VERY good service! Very polite and personable people working here! And LOVE the \"no sagging pants allowed\" sign on the front door"}
{"text":"The best pie in town for over 25 years. My favorite us the cheese pizza. There ranch is legendary. The lunch 2 slice special is affordable and awesome. There is a no sagging pants rule lol."}
{"text":"Very good, but not quite NY style. Thin crust, Sicilian, Stromboli. Very small eating area. Most of their business has to be pick-up. The bakers are a little rude. The pizza is a little greasy, but I don't mind. The crust is probably in the top 5 crusts in North East LV.
They would be a perfect 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly people. I had my toddler on one arm and the elderly man helped me bring it to my car while I got my baby in. Must I mention he opened up both doors to help me. 
Now the pizza and ranch are to die for. After a long day at work and ran few errands. This was seriously cherry to the Sunday! 
Will MOST DEF! Tell people about it and will come eat here too. Thank you for the amazing costumer service."}
{"text":"No complaints. Excellent pizza - had half cheese and half \"buffalo chicken\" - it wasn't their true specialty buffalo chicken which has a different sauce base, but a full red sauce pie with buffalo seasoned chicken chunks on half. Chicken was good, not overcooked, crispy. A bit too salty though. 
Crust wasn't soggy, had a chewy crunch; stood up pretty well as a good NY slice should. I travel to Vegas for work and as of now, this is my go to spot for pizza. It's good enough that I probably won't keep looking for alternatives."}
{"text":"Honestly I can't believe I'm going to say this but this place has \"THE BEST\" Hot Wings I've ever had my entire life. I've tried many places traveling and this place is hands down the best place to get Hot Wings. Finger licking good! Wings were nice size too and what I loved about the taste of the hot wings was that it was definitely hot enough to where I didn't even have to add any extra hot sauces or ranch and it was still good. The flavor of the chicken was on point too. Looking forward to trying more stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall NY style pizza place!! The subs and pizza are amazing and the prices are reasonable. I would give them 5 stars if they offered a few more entree selections!"}
{"text":"Eat here weekly and always great. Small shop, easy going staff, and simple good food. Also owner looks like Ser Davos.. just sayin."}
{"text":"Driving around town, I started to crave for something cheesy. So pizza it was! I yelped for a pizza place close to where we were and this place came up! Boyfriend and I walked in and were greeted by the workers. We didn't catch the guys' name, but he was nice. Well he actually came off rude at first, but only because he was so serious and short with his words. But people have different personalities and he was one of those who R actually very nice, & a bit funny in his own way. I work retail at the airport, so I pick up on different personalities and attitudes pretty quick. Anyways, the pizza was good. Bf ordered me an extra cheesy slice, so they added more cheese. He ordered himself a meatball pizza, and they actually added slices of real meatball! Lol. The place itself looked like it was a hole in the wall in little Italy New York. I'd definitely come back here again. :)"}
{"text":"Verrazano Pizza is a hole in the wall pizza joint that my family and I have been going to for many years. Depending on the time of day you stop in, unless it happens to be a Monday (they are closed only on Monday), you might have to wait for a seat unless you are getting your order to-go. I was telling my friend about this place and suggested it for lunch just over a month ago. When we walked in I noticed every table was taken. Luckily it didn't take long for a table to open up. I do wish they wiped up the tables more often during the busier times instead of us customers just taking over a table that is whatever way the previous person left it. When I stopped by for lunch last week, I was the only person there, so you just never know when they will be busy as this is a popular spot.

I usually just have the cheese slice special unless I'm picking up a whole pizza to take home. The special is $5.29 and you get 2 slices of cheese and a drink. Each additional item is 50 cents. The sauce has a nice sweet flavor and the crust is thin yet has a slight crispness on the bottom and holds up cheese and toppings well. If you like to \"fold and eat\" then this pizza is perfect for that. I like how they aren't stingy with the cheese. Solid lunch spot indeed. 

They also offer hot and cold sandwiches, chicken wings and fingers, pasta, calzones, salad and fried foods like mushrooms and ravioli. I have had some of their sandwiches and just found them to be okay. Here it's all about the pizza for me. They have a pick-up special for $11.99 that will get you a large 16\" cheese pizza during normal business hours."}
{"text":"Great food. We order there all the time but the service is terrible very rude. The guy that took my phone order and the guy hung up on me.  Took my order brought it but still very rude."}
{"text":"Best pizza!!friendly and prompt service pizza is always fresh and hot when it's delivered!!
Definitely generous on the toppings"}
{"text":"New management is better they treat first responders and military great! The owner goes beyond what I expected. My son love their cheese pizza and my wife love their pizza dough. This is my one stop NY style pizza and wings! Try the white pizza it's great too! I feel bad for the old employees though they seem to be bitter about what happened again this place is great pizza place and don't let the bad reviews stop you especially majority of them are from the old management."}
{"text":"Great, delicious pizza spot, chicken fingers are delicious also! Seems like a family owned place which I always like to support! Great service also dined in and the kids working were very polite and helpful! Will be coming back and recommend to anyone looking for some delicious home made pizza! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Recently moved into the neighborhood. These guys are amazing! Everything is delicious and fresh. Friday night takeout has become the norm with this place. Don't skip the Garlic Knots."}
{"text":"First, let me start of by saying that their pizza is among the best in the city. That being said, the place is poorly managed and understaffed. The last 3 times I got a pizza there, I had to wait at least 15 minutes after the time they told me my pizza would be ready. Tonight, I was told my pizza would be ready in 35 minutes. I arrived 40 minutes later and the pizza cook told me that mine would be the next one he puts in the oven and it would be another 20 minutes.  He said that he got a lot of orders all at once and mine was the last one. If he knew that, he should have told me it would be an hour from the start. I would have waited, and been less irritated. I don't blame it on the cook, but rather on the management. They should know that they need adequate staffing to handle the volume of business that they get. Especially on a Sunday night during football season! I love the pizza, but this is probably the last time that I will be back.

UPDATE: I have been back several times since I wrote my review, and the service has improved immensely. The pizza is very good and you no longer have to wait forever for your order to be ready. Grade increased to 4stars."}
{"text":"This place is always great. Every time we go in. We asked about some prices on pizza and wings and then asked if they had any specials. The guy asked what we wanted so we told him and he replied 'yeah we got a special for that.' Mind you the amount of wings we wanted weren't the sizes he said they had. Super accommodating and really affordable for great food!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best NY Pizza in Vegas look no further than Verrazano.  Pies are made to order and the wings are crispy and delicious.  They also serve up tasty sandwiches and pasta.  This is the best east coast pizzeria out west."}
{"text":"\" Best Pizza in Vegas \".  Everyone has their own opinion on who has the best pizza.  I've tried all my friends places, some were decent some sucked.  Then last year I met my girlfriend a local like me, and she introduced me to Verrazano Pizza.  If a pizzas grease runs down your arm, and drips off your elbow, then that's for me.  The sauce is fantastic, the crust is NY style, and there homemade ranch \" forget about it \".  This Verrazanos Pizza is independently owned, the others in town do no justice.  I usually get plane cheese pizza, but there sausage is the bomb.  There deep fried mushrooms are rocking too. It is truly a hole in the wall on Rainbow and Westcliff \" Food For Less shopping center\".  I'm hooked, I've  been here multiple times a month for the last year.  This is my holy grail of pizza places."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. The pizza takes me back to when I was in high school and we used to run to a different pizza place by the school and get a slice for $1. MMMMMmmmmm. Nothing fancy, just plain old take out pizza. I like it."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza hands down, their salads are huge, eggplant is amazing, and the ranch dressing is the best I've ever tasted. Prices are also reasonable. Definitely my favorite go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"$75 for 50 small wings and didnt  even come with cerlery and carrots. We will no go back"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent, coming from new york I have had the best pizzas on the planet and these guys know how to make a pie 2 thumbs way up. .."}
{"text":"I was craving New York style pizza tonight and I am so glad we came here! It is exactly what I needed! Gooey cheesey pie with very friendly service and very casual and clean environment. Crust was great along with sauce and cheese. Not too greasy, just right! I am looking forward to coming back and trying the ziti."}
{"text":"Holy mother of pizza heaven, in all of my years of pizza eating this was by far the best I've ever had! We ordered the Verrazano (like a supreme) and all the meats and veggies married in my mouth with the right amount of cheese and crust....light and thin....tasty and delicious:))) Im glad a friend told me to try this place, it is right around the corner from my house and if i was never told how good it was I would have never tried it. I have a few places that I go for pizza and stick to them, this is now first on my list:)"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from many people on Yelp Talk, so I decided to give it a try.  I stopped by for lunch yesterday and ordered 2 Slices of Cheese and 1 Slice of Pepperoni.  I wanted to try their Sicilian Pizza, but they didn't serve slices and I wasn't about to chow down that much Pizza....not that day anyway.

The Pizza is a NY Style Thin Crust.  It's served piping hot.  I went for the Cheese Slices first.  I thought that the Cheese to Sauce ratio was good.  The Crust was a little bland, but it wasn't soggy, which is a big plus.  Overall, I enjoyed the Cheese Slices.

Next I went after the Pepperoni Slice.  I prefer to have my Pepperoni well done burnt a little on the edges, but I didn't hold that against them.  The Pepperoni has a nice zing to it and the Pizza slice had an appropriate amount of Pepperoni....I don't like it when too much Pepperoni is put on a Pizza, it can ruin the flavor.

Overall, I thought the Pizza here was very good.  I'm not sure how it will hold up on delivery though as most NY Style Thin Crust Pizza that I've ordered delivered shows up soggy.  The people who work here are very friendly too, which is another plus in my book.

Will I return?  Of course!"}
{"text":"Now IDK, real New York!! Real family owned ! All new staff ! Nothing frozen. They got east cost manhattan coffee,
Sodas ! Omg  more specials! Save money !who loves yeah baby! Eat your heart out Amore' this is really the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New York and I have to say that the Pizza from Verrazano is exactly like I'd get back home!!! Love this place!! I'd highly recommend it to everyone that enjoys a good pizza."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered from this place for awhile, but I remember liking this place due to the fact that they're one of the few places that does Sicilian-style pizza.  It was delicious!  It's huge, though, so make sure you have a couple of friends if you're going to order a Sicilian."}
{"text":"Ordered to go: everything was ready by the 25 minutes I got there. I'm obsessed with thin crust and full flavour, and this place definitely lived up to my expectations. The two people there are experienced dough-flipping-spinning people with awesome skills. Just a little pricey, but I didn't expect  excellent Las Vegas pizza to be cheap."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us from a few friends that have been coming here for over 25 years. They definitely do everything right. They have great customer service and fantastic NY Pizza!
Friday nights are always busy but they are attentive to each customer.
You love this place!"}
{"text":"Verrazano specializes in New York style pizza-- my favorite kind. The eating area leaves a lot to be desired, but at $11 for a large cheese pizza, you can't really expect much more. The staff was friendly. When the pizza maker realized that my daughter was watching him in rapt attention, he  made a point of telling her when he was about to throw the dough in the air. (This kind of thing is apparently very entertaining to 8-year-olds.) Its always a risk to try strip mall pizza, but this is definitely worth the gamble."}
{"text":"Friend and I went into this shop which smelled terrible upon entering and ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza. The male at the counter who took our order, grabbed two slices of what appeared to be old pizza with his bare hands and placed the slices in the oven. After seeing this we cancelled our order and left the shop.  Super disgusting."}
{"text":"Just like NY. The sauce, the cheese, the grease, all of it. Ate every slice. Kids loved it too. About as close as I can get them to Brooklyn pizza without living there!"}
{"text":"Authentic NYC pizza. I'm hooked. Moved from NYC 7 years ago and I can't believe I just found this place. Truly a gem."}
{"text":"Not bad Verrazano, not bad.  This is an alright spot to grab a quick slice or two of a pizza pie and go.  It's a small shop facing Rainbow (next major cross street being Westcliff).  The owners and their family running the shop are like all the other business owners out there and are fantastic.

I'll be back for more pizza and would recommend trying it at least once.  If you do make it here, try to read the outside signs from the inside and see if you can spot the optical illusion, really funny.

I've only tried the pizza here and nothing else but every pizza they have made me has been good.  While I was here I saw a couple people come in for their pick up orders, so they do have loyal customers that really enjoy the pie.  I like it, come in and have a bite."}
{"text":"Verrazano's is in the rotation for carryout pizza & wings in the area. I think the pizza is good, not great, and I don't really like the wings (too greasy), but my husband does. I think it's a 3 star place, but after my last experience, I won't be back, and almost want to lower it to one star. 

We ordered a pizza and wings for pickup and the man on the phone said it would be ready in 25 minutes. Show up to pick up the goods and there's a man in front of us trying to order a couple slices to eat in. 

The cashier/order taker/pizza maker behind the counter says, \"Oh, we're out of slices tonight.\" (approx. 5:30pm on a Friday night). 

Customer: Ok, then we'll just get a whole pie.
Counter Guy: Welll....I've got a lot of orders ahead of you. It's gonna be a while.
Customer: Like how long?
Counter Guy: Oh....at least an hour and a half.
 
Obviously, these customers leave, unhappy with their experience.
 
Our turn.
 
Husband: Hey, we have an order for pickup.
Counter Guy: Oh man...I haven't even started making it yet (5 mins after we were told it would be ready)
Husband: Ok - well how much longer is it going to be?
Counter Guy: I don't know. There's a lot of orders ahead of you.
 
Wow! We had to cancel our order and go to Pizza My Dear on Warm Springs instead. I would be kinda pissed any time if I was told it would take an hour and a half to make a pizza for carryout (it's not like it was the super bowl or something), but especially when I called ahead and you told me less than 30 minutes!! Sorry, Verrazano's, I won't be back to give you another chance."}
{"text":"After trying around a bit, this is my go-to for NY style pizza. Yet to try their Sicilian-style. Tried a few kinds of toppings and never been let down. Prices are great too for something not made on an assembly line at a chain store."}
{"text":"What's with the freshness and quality of ingredients served in this city??

Ordered some wings and a salad for delivery. Shouldnt be that complicated and I should not feel completely sick to my stomach a few hours after finishing eating!

Chicken wings were way overcooked, and tasted funny. Salad was alright, but it felt like it was prepared 48h prior, and left in the fridge for the next delivery order (mine!)

Seriously feel like I am going to puke now and have stomach cramps. And I dont have a delicate stomach, I mean I have lived and traveled in Africa and Amazonian jungle.

Do I have to stick with 3* Michelin restaurants to not get sick in this city!?  Grrrrrr"}
{"text":"Awesome NYC pizza, my second favorite NYC style pizza in Vegas.  I stop here pretty often whenever I am on the west side. 4.2 stars"}
{"text":"I was debating to go to this place or somewhere else, I've chosen  them for the reviews, I've arrived 20 minutes before closing just to find out that only to go orders, (I GUESS I DID NOT HAVE ANY   OTHER OPTION) to my surprise to find out how saggy and greasy  my pizza was that my wife did not care for it."}
{"text":"Really, really liked this pizza. Got the slices...two pepperoni for Jim, and one cheese for me. Loved the nice crispy brown crust, tangy sauce and perfect amount of cheese. The cheese and crust were the same thickness. Perfect!!! There was a nice amount of grease on top of the slice. This is a must for me.

The restaurant looked like we walked into a small, old school inner city restaurant. It was fun. Good service. Waited for a bit to be recognized, but once we were, it was fine."}
{"text":"We were happy to see that this location was open as well. This is one our favorite NY Style pizza places. We got a slice of cheese, and a slice of pepperoni. Not too much grease, and super thin crust. I am glad that this location is not just right around the corner from my house, otherwise I might have a problem with my 'diet'."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING ! I'm always in here grabbing a slice or a pie for dinner . also the WINGS ARE juicy and crispy ! All around the best pizzeria in Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"I have been IN LOVE with this pizza joint for close to 20-years. If you're craving a greasy, New York style, little slice of heaven ... then this is your spot! Old school Vegas commercial center with the best dough in town. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place now for about 15 years. Thin crust NY style pizza at its best. What I like as a single guy. I can walk in & do their 2 slices & a drink lunch special. Always hot & ready..."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in town! The staff is always great and the pizza reminds me of home (Boston). It's my go to"}
{"text":"Best NYC style Pizza in the city, no doubt about it!!!"}
{"text":"Came in one afternoon and decided to get the lunch special. I heard good things about this place so I was looking forward to trying the NY Style Pizza. 
Lunch Special was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. Pretty good deal but the pizza left a lot to be desired. Pizza was wet and limp, almost undercooked. Just didn't stand up at all to NY pizza I've had in the past. Too bad. Not saying I wouldn't try it again but first impression was just not a good one."}
{"text":"Very pleased!  The fried mushrooms are fresh and the ranch tastes house-made.  The pizza is awesome!  We're from back east (Ohio) so we are a bit picky on pizza.  This place is great!"}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from this restaurant for years and today I was treated like a liar. My mom called and ordered a Sicilian pizza and they made a regular. I told them that's not what I ordered, they told me I was wrong, made me wait 20 minutes for a new pizza and made me pay the difference in price after giving me attitude about their stupidity. If I wasn't hungry, I would've left. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"This is as good as any NY-style pizza you will find in Las Vegas. It will transport you to NYC - it's the real deal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Been coming here since I was a kid and it's always good. They could be a little friendlier on the phone, but the food is good. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok .. I ordered a large Verrazano specialty pizza and the crust had kind of a generic taste and sauce was ok but just plain I guess.. Good portion of ingredients. Still not worth 25 dollars plus tip:-("}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in town. My husband and I have been coming here for 10 years and have yet to find a better tasting pizza. It's just as good now and it was 10 years now!"}
{"text":"great new york style pizza. super friendly & fast. dine-in is a little iffy but food is good. pricy=large delivered with wings @$40"}
{"text":"Walked in at 1pm Lunch time, NO HELLO, a sourpuss big guy just starred at us, he was the only worker, No other customers, food looked old & Dry. Pizza was Dry, Old. And reheated. Place looked dirty, had No other business, all other places close by where busy, it was lunch time. Stale Pizza ! Unhappy miserably sad worker. We left him looking for his VOICE & PERSONALITY ! Maybe it's under the Verranzano bridge in BKLYN ! Old DRY Food, too bad."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST pizza in vegas!
The staff is amazing & the food is fantastic! TRY EVERYTHING!!! & do NOT forget to ask for their ranch dressing - you will want to mainline this stuff! SOOOO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Forgettable.

Don't get me wrong, this pizza place is good NY-style pizza. BUT my boyfriend and I both felt is was not the best we've had. My boyfriend is a pizza eating machine, but even a few hours later after leaving Verrazano he told me he didn't think it was that great. I'd have to agree.

I like the shop, it's quaint and gives you a feeling like you're really eating in a hole-in-the-wall in New York City. The staff was friendly enough and our pizza came out pretty quick. There was only two other people in the place when we walked in. 

We ordered a large with mushrooms and ham. Normally I would get pepperoni, but my boyfriend thinks it's too greasy *eye roll* Anyway, I had a LivingSocial deal for $20 and our total came to $18.something so we ended up not having to pay anything over, which I'm glad about.

I felt as though the pizza did not have enough sauce and the cheese was kind of bland. Also, they were super skimpy on our toppings! I was really, really wanting some more mushrooms, but alas our pizza had only a few.

I see that there are many good reviews for the white pizza, so if anything, I'd come back here to try that pizza. But being that it really isn't anywhere near where I live I probably will not get the chance."}
{"text":"Come here and get pizza  it's by the slice or whole. Great place for a lunch date, or while you're waiting for a massage at the massage school next door"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!!! I've been eating here for over 15 years and absolutely love EVERYTHING!! Service is fabulous and friendly!! I'm currently pregnant and craving their pizza, which is a 20 min drive weekly from our house and worth every minute driving!! I will not eat else where!! Thanks guys for the great service and food!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Verrazano is gone and tonight we ordered a pizza and it looked like a 6th grade home ec experiment. We also ordered wings and they were swimming in grease. Loved their ranch dressing from the past and the new owners gave nothing. Afraid this place will be gone soon. Verrazano come back please!!!"}
{"text":"great pie.perfect balance of dough. sauce  and cheese .nothing overpowering one another."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant parmigiano dinner.
I ordered to go.

I asked to use the restroom while I waited, and I was told they didn't have one. 
There are 8 tables there so what do dine-in guests do?

I had already paid. I had already tipped.  I am not dirty nor do I look like the type to do drugs.

But I was told no.  So, ya know. That felt quite rude, and well I sat quite uncomfortably for quite some time.

As for the dish itself, the spaghetti was seriously over cooked.  Quite mushy.
The eggplant was pretty okay. The sauce wasnt bad after I added some red chili flakes.

But quite annoyingly, they did not provide me with cutlery.  And so after I realized this, I had to go back out to procure some as all of mine are currently boxed and stored away.

Anyway, it's not like it was a god-awful dish, but between the spaghetti, my bladder, and fork situation... eh. 

I likely won't be back.  There are just too many choices.  
Sort of a shame as I used to go there when I last lived in the neighborhood.

Oh well."}
{"text":"Good pizza made fresh. What more to say. Large
Half Pep/Sausage extra Cheese $17 bucks"}
{"text":"i found this place driving around for lunch and landed on a GREAT lunch deal.  2 cheese slices and medium drink for less than 5 bucks!  pizza is good as well.  thin crust and pretty similar to back home (east).  

the place has enough tables to eat there and 2 tvs.  definitely a great lunch spot for only a few bucks.  i'll be back since it's near my office.  plenty of parking although it is in a very busy parking lot."}
{"text":"* Customer service: 4/5
Greeted us, took our order quickly, and began working on it right away. He didn't charge us until it was finished and even though we ordered to-go, they offered plates and napkins.

* Cleanliness: 5/5
Clean floor, tables, and kitchen.

* Food and quality: 4/5
Lately, I have been on the search for LV's New York style pizza. This place was close, but honestly it wasn't IT. We ordered a pepperoni with extra sauce because the sauce usually makes the pizza. But the pizza hardly had any sauce, the cheese was average mozzarella, but the crust was PERFECT (not too thin and not too thick and had a nice fresh dough taste). Lastly, the pizza wasn't too greasy, it had just enough for that extra flavor and to prevent dryness.

Now, for the garlic knots. The garlic knots were REALLY GOOD. They were cooked in the oven along with the pizza. Bread was soft and was soaking in some fresh garlic and butter. The sauce used for dipping was hand made, as there were chunks of tomato, onion and garlic. The knots had to be the best part.

* Atmosphere and room capacity: 3/5
Restaurant was in an older plaza, it is located in a tight corner so it could be hard to find. Inside, the decor was out-dated deli style set up.

* Price: 5/5
We ordered a large one-topping for $15.00 and garlic knots for $2.00

* Recommend or return?
I would recommend if you're just looking for your average pizza (that is NOT Little Caesar's) but honestly, this is not NY pizza. It's close but no cigar. But I am definitely willing to give it another try :)"}
{"text":"sooo good!!! i loved it and the fresh ingredients were a plus! i will be def ordering again from them!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had in Vegas. Been eating it for years. The east side location is in my opinion the best. Go check them out and get the special. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! Always on point. Got wings this time and they were disappointing.  No sauce and dry. Got hot and mild, they were not labeled on which was which, and they were lacking flavor.  Won't order again."}
{"text":"First off, the new owner is so friendly and down to earth, super cool guy! Secondly, the food is delicious and the lunch specials are amazing! My boyfriend and I ate for under $15 (drink included)! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place ever!! Wings sucked so bad! The old guy making the pizza was picking his nose and tossing pizza dough in the air!!! Then all of the sudden I see this dang mice run across the Side of the wall I said forget that and left. Nasty!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best pizza joints I've ever been to!  The pizza is made with the perfect bread to cheese to sauce ratio and toppings are fresh and tasty.  We got the 30 wings and large pizza special.  The staff was very accommodating and gave us samples of all the sauces for the wings on the side.  Hands down best ranch dressing you'll ever taste!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt like the price was a little high.  I mean even though it's delicious it's still only pizza.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has an old style feel to it. There are two main guys who work there and everyone seems to recognize them. They even got a little cartoon on the tip jar that looks just like said 'pizza making' dudes. Guy I dealt with was very nice. White baseball cap. Grey hair. Mustache. Friendly and welcoming. Pretty cool feel for your typical pizza spot...

But the price is f*cking amazing. $11 large pizza? Forget about it. A little greasy(it's a pizza. What do you expect?), but extremely satisfying. Hate to sound like a glutton, but it's one of those \"you should just buy the whole pie instead of only a slice\" situations.

This was one of the first places that I visited specifically because of the Yelp reviews during my lunch. And it did not disappoint. No disrespect to Pizza Hut or Dominos, but the taste is authentic and the price is right. Don't pass this place up as I'm sure if will be your new favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"2nd time here cuz pizza is great, but..... as I go to grab a napkin out the napkin dispense a roach popped out.... my husband told the guy up front and they apologized then blamed it on chop sticks next door then offered us a free drink!! REALLY!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and ranch! Friendly quick delivery normally there before the 45 minutes they give you.  It's our go to! Order a Hawaiian with jalapeños and onions!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place... it's growing on me. We order cheese, nothing special and toss some crushed red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and crushed oregano all over it. What really makes the pie... ranch dressing. It's probably a sin to dip your pizza into ranch, but hands-down, Verrazano's has the best ranch dressing I've ever experienced. Sadly, I will claim to be a ranch connoisseur, you could even say I'm a ranch snob. I would eat this ranch dressing off an old flip-flop.

I haven't eaten much else there yet but I will totally update after I do. It's around the corner from me and it's the hubby's favorite so I know I'll be eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Now IDK pizza, as in I Don't Know pizza. Appropriately named as the new owners make a cold and soggy pizza (I had mine delivered)

So sad, I loved Verrazanos pizza and hoped the new owner would not change a thing. 

Too late. A friend and I ordered our usual for lunch delivery. Quoted 45 minutes. Ok, that's normal. An hour and 15 minutes later no pizza. When it finally came, an hour and half, the pizza was c c cold and soggy. The mushrooms tasted \"dirty\", like no one washed them before they cooked them.

This is a HUGE disappointment as now I/we have to find a new place for pizza delivery.

Why, why, why would you ruin a good thing and change the quality of a great pizza."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS EGGPLANT PARMESAN SUBS

  I'll take Verrazano over the Subway. Verrazano is a New York pizzaria and sub restaurant named after the World famous suspension bridge connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island. It is a slice of the Big Apple in Bright Light City. It is not their New York pizza but their delicious New York style eggplant parmesan sub that has kept me returning. 

  This Verrazano is located at the southwest corner of Eastern and Windmill in the Smith's-anchored shopping center. As soon as you step inside the small restaurant, you leave Las Vegas for a mom and pop pizza shop. The white walls are covered with pictures of New York City memorbelia. The red booths resemble the New York pizzaria. The scent of baking pizza permeates the small restaurant. The owner, an older man with a grey mustache reminds me of a New York pizzaria owner east of the Hudson River. 

  I have been a regular the past couple of months. The first time I dined here was on a Saturday evening after work.  I made the trip for the eggplant parmesan sub. At the time, they were out of it. So, I went for two slices of New York style pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was good and could give some New York pizzarias a run for the money. The owner was personable referring to me and his customers as \"friend.\" He only charged me for the lunch special. A week later, I made another attempt to try their eggplant parmesan sub. They were not out. This is the equivalent of a New York eggplant parmesan sub with thick slices of egg plant, mouth watering melted parmesan cheese, and toasted bread. It was so delicious that I'd return a few more times. When the owner was here he'd greet me by saying, \"hello friend.\" He'd only charge 50 cents for the fountain Pepsi. Usually the hero took ten minutes, which was well worth it. I'd entertain myself looking up at the overhead TV which played anything from basketball to Cops or looked down at the free Las Vegas newspapers or my phone. The baking that took place in the kitchen put a nice potpourri throughout the room. The last time I returned here, the same owner that called me friend on past visits, didn't greet me or talk to me. When I walked in somebody else took my order and when I handed my Pepsi cup to the owner for a top off, he didn't say anything to me. And this time, I overheard him telling a customer that they ran out of pizza slices. At any rate, I don't visit Verrazano for commaderie.  I make the trip here for one of the dearest foods in my life: the eggplant parmesan sub. 

  I am a fan of the delicious eggplant parmesan sub. Disparate from Subway and Port of Subs where they seem to be in almost every major shopping mall, there are currently few restaurants in Las Vegas that serve eggplant parmesan subs. How many New York pizzarias are there in Vegas? There are only a percentage of this small number that serve eggplant parmesan subs. On account of the fact that  Verrazano is one of the few restaurants serving eggplant parmesan subs, someday I plan to return for more."}
{"text":"I usually get the large cheese pizza and hot fries. This pizza is huge and very tasty!!!! I'm not into hot and spicy things but my fiance is and she loves these fries. I highly suggest giving this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I love Verrazano's it is one of my top favorite places to eat pizza! I have been coming here for over 10 years and the quality of their pizza has remained the same I appreciate consistency and that is what I get here. I always know that I can expect great service and great pizza when I am there. The buffalo fries and the ranch are also excellent here. I definitely recommend you try it it is so worth it."}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot in Vegas for an authentic New York Pizza experience.

I really appreciated the humor and service by the entire staff there. Aside from
having mouthwatering delicious pies they also make you feel at home with their
personal touch. Verrazano's is a Vegas landmark, having been here since the 70s.

Their cheese pizza is sublime. Can't go wrong with that. Also a sausage and mushroom
combination is delicious too!

I see myself being a regular here without a doubt."}
{"text":"To the guy who said this is authentic new york pizza. It's not
Have you ever eaten Original Ray's? Ever been to New York city? Come on now. 
It's OK. But, New York pizza stands alone.. 
Metro is the closest I've had in Vegas. There's a parlor on the strip that's pretty close. The rest suck."}

{"text":"My favorite authentic NY style pepperoni pizza in Vegas... try the fried ravioli and the cheese steak"}
{"text":"After many good years eating Verrazano, it has sadly come to an end.  I'm not sure if they had changed owners or what going on but the last two times I've ordered I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery.  First time (10/31)  it took them an hour 35 and with no apology and I was stuck with $80 of cold soggy pizza.  The second (and last time which was today, 11/22) I was quoted 40 minutes and 1 hour 55 minutes later our food was delivered.  The pizza was cold and soggy, the wings undercooked and the ranch was warm and spoiled.  When the driver finally showed, without an apology he stated they were running behind.  Sorry Verrazano, while we loved you long time, we are now divorced."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, but as soon as you walk in, you will know you made the right choice coming here.  It smells absolutely delicious and not in that overpowering sense where you are afraid you will stink of hot cheese all day long. 

They have a fantastic lunch special; 2 slices and a drink for less than $6.  It's absolutely awesome!   I always get the cheese pizza, and the crust and the amount of cheese and sauce is perfect.  

The guys here are also very nice.  You must come check this place out."}
{"text":"Used to eat here many years ago when studying at Nevada School of Massage Therapy. Went in today at 10.30 (they close at 11), their floors were being cleaned and they asked us to stay on one side, we were the only people in there except for one lady with a take out order. 
We ordered two slices with a limited English speaking person and were told $4 by some other guy. No hello, no, are you eating in, no anything else... we added and drink and asked for ranch too late as they had already swiped our card. They asked us to include .60 cents on the tip line when signing. 
Very rude, gives no shits attitudes. They heated our slices ($5.00 total BTW) and packed in a too go 'box'. We pulled them out and ate at a table. They turned off wheel of fortune on the TV and just kind on stared at us until we finished and left by 10.45. 
Rude. 
They only get 1 stars because of the memories. Pizzas not fabulous. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas for 15+ years. You have to try the ranch, it's the best I've ever had!  The staff is always the same and so friendly."}

{"text":"Great food here. My personal favorite is the chicken fingers, some of the best I've ever tasted! Fairly priced, great service, all around fantastic pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and awesome chicken fingers. It was also very affordable.This is definitely my new pizza spot. They are also very kid friendly. The staff interacted nicely with my infant daughter.  What a find!"}
{"text":"It took a while for me to try this place since it was closed like twice in a row when I went! I finally snagged a pepperoni pie last week and I'm a definite fan. It is hard to find good NY-style (or any style, really) in Las Vegas. I know a couple of other spots, but Verrazano is now in my top two! The pepperoni pizza was so greasy, I actually had to blot it with paper towels, which I never do! Most NYC transplants should be very pleased with this place...and they sell by the slice, too."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and have had lots of good pizza. This place is solid. Compared to places in NY it's pretty average, but compared to places outside of NY, it's good. The slices I ordered were heated up and not too fresh."}
{"text":"Quality pizza all the way. The cheese crust and sauce were of such high quality this easily is the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas. I have ordered from them several times and they are consistently amazing. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhh Verrazanos! I've neglected you for so long! I was born and raised in Vegas and can Tell you I've been coming here since I was a little kid and yes this place has legit NY style pizza. It's the same as years ago when my mom would come pick up wings and pizza for us. The pizza is perfectly sauces and they're not stingy with the cheese but it's all about the crust. I recommend letting it cool down for a few minutes. I like the crust between crispy and soft. If you eat it too quick you can't full enjoy every component. Slap some oregano and chili flakes on it and you're in pizza heaven. Don't forget to order ranch for your wings I don't know what they out in it but I imagine they have this stuff in heaven it's like liquid gold. Purely delectable. It's a garlic ranch so don't plan on making out with anyone after you'll be sure to scare all the vampires away so no need to worry about Dracula coming for ya! Wings could use more sauce but my mom can't handle spicy so she likes em that way. I wouldn't order the garlic knots again. Boring reheated bread with slight garlic flavor but they weren't fresh. Stick with the pizza you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I tried this joint on the reviews from fellow yelpers...  I ordered the 2 cheese slices and soda for 4.75.... I liked it, the dough was good,, the pizza folded nicely... When i order i usually ask for  a little bit more sauce, since this was pre-made slices, the sauce wasnt as pronounced,, but its fine... When i am in the area, and in the mood for pizza,, this is a fine go to place... I recommend it based on what i had....

I have gone here several times since my first yelp..  I just want to say that, I like this pizza joint,, every time i have gone its been consistently good...  Always eat it fresh at the shop if you can,,, it tastes best just out of the oven..  Good job Verrazano's.  I only grant 5 stars if its FREE food....LOL..."}
{"text":"I lived in the east for a while, so I've had my fair share of good pizza. 
When I moved out here, I could not for the life of me, find a pizza place that was even close to the ones in the east.
In fact, before Verrazano was recommended to me, I considered Dominos the best pizza in the area. 
This place has what I consider the best flat pizza, on my side of town, at least.
I asked them why their pizza was better than the others in the area, and they said it was because they take precautions with their pizza dough, so that it doesn't dry out.
They said that was the reason why there aren't any good pizza places out here.
That sort of made sense to me, because it is much drier out here than in the east.
Sometimes my wife tells me that the owners are a little rude, but she says that about everyone.
So my wife would probably rate it as four stars, but I'm the one with the Yelp account, so five stars."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest, when I ordered a regular pie here, I was a little underwhelmed. I basically wrote this place off as \"not worthy\".  Then a few people told me the Sicilian was good here. I'm an absolute sucker for a good Sicilian pizza. So with slight hesitation I ordered one, and I'm glad I did. It was similar to the Sicilians we use to make at The Big Inning. I liked it a lot! Plus it takes up the entire pizza box, which is the way it should be. I'm convinced this is one of the best Sicilian pies you'll get in this town. Also, the garlic rolls are just like New York garlic rolls! That, plus they deliver and are right around the corner from my house and we got a winner. I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but their mediocre regular pie and terrible hours made it more of a 3, 3 1/2. Since we can't give halves, 3 it is. The wings were decent, slightly above average. I would get them again, but they aren't \"OMG amazing!!!\". So keep all that in mind."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Supposed to be more \"authentic\" than most others in town, and it DOES taste a little different...in a good way?  Maybe...depends on who you ask!

Verrazano Pizza is a good choice for lunch! 2 slices and a drink for around $5...I think the toppings were an extra $0.50 or so.  The slices are pre-made, just tossed back in the oven with your toppings like everyone else in town.

Started off with the Pepperoni slice! Very oily and tasty...super simple, cheesy, foldable slices. Since I am not from NY, I don't care much about authenticity, but these are good slices at reasonable prices.

Sausage slice! This was good as well...I think I prefer their pepperoni topping more here...weird, since I have been a house-sausage-topping guy for a little while now.

Don't expect anything else besides good pizza and cheap prices.  It's like a family owned pizzeria style spot, and they do it well :)

{"text":"Visiting family in November (yes, this is long overdue)... We were all craving either pizza or take-out Chinese.  Finally settling on pizza, we had three nearby places to choose from.  Two places were either flyers left on the apartment door at my sister's place or just 3 blocks down the street.  Read the reviews on those and thought they were sketchy.  Found Verrazano's!  It was a 4-mile drive, but totally worth it.

In all of my travels to New York, Chicago, Portland, OR (where I used to live), and the local places I like in my hometown, Verrazano's is easily in the top 3 of my favorite pizza joints now.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  Sometimes you'll find a gem, and this place definitely qualifies!

Crust was perfectly baked and flavorful on its own.  The sauce wasn't overstated with spices or bland like other places I've tried.  Toppings were just the right proportion, yet still generous.  When I return to Vegas to visit my family, we will definitely get pizza here again.  You can choose to eat in or do take-out, of course.  Prices are very reasonable.  Nice, clean atmosphere if you want to stay."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Verrazano's since 1986! And it's the its the Best by far New York style, which is my favorite type pizza! Their service is warm and attentive. It's a complete pleasure to eat here....a must try! You won't be sorry...their buffalo chicken wings are the bomb! Very perfectly made."}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza around... No doubt when I'm looking for some pies I go and order from here... They've been gracious to me and I can't thank them enough for all their customer service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Flavor was alright crust is mediocre and the fact I had to cut my pizza and use a fork to scrape all of the toppings off the box. Will not be ordering again. Paying 33 dollars for 2 pizzas and them turning out like this is unacceptable. So greasy I couldn't eat a whole slice. Really really disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is really going downhill how do you run out of garlic knots at 4 PM you haven't  hit your dinner rush yet!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover and this has to be one of the best places for homemade classic Italian pizza...best combination of fresh homemade dough, tasty sauce with a hint of sweetness, and creamy cheesy cheese. Between myself and my family I am pretty sure Pizza Fridays in our family have kept the ovens going! Verrazanos is a family staple in our home...little taste of greatness. 

Highly recommended by this pizza lover!"}
{"text":"I good food, simple menu but everything is good.  My only complaint is \"TURN ON THE AC\"  to close to summer in this Desert to feel like a suana.  How ever I really enjoyed the food.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never call this location for an order. When you arrive there they will deny they received it!! Then instead of service recovery they will claim that they never received the order and claim you are a liar. I gladly took my money elsewhere!!! The two men working 10/12/15 at 7pm are not working to make money nor satisfy customers!!"}
{"text":"I must state for the record; This is the best hand-made & hand-delivered in under 45min around my house!! I LOVE THE #MEATLOVERS! Thanks for all the years! #KeepItUp

However you want it, they will make it... Even if you're craving anchovies!! #Pizza #Originals From the East Coast to Vegas with Love!"}
{"text":"Yes it's a pizza joint...but was in the mood for a folded pizza lets say...Calzone..You can have it baked or fried!!  Order a small Calzone..OMG it was more than enough, took half home. Had small salad ($2.99)..just lettuce,olives,tomatoes,peppers..not great, but italian dressing was good.  Calzone was good.....but I guess their forte is Pizza....He had a line ordering .....Service is friendly but hit/miss w/ whoever is working the house. Waiter said the baked calzone was just coming out of the oven..took him 15 min to get it to the table....Would I go back, probably if I lived closer..I'd consider Broadway Pizza a better option (Rancho/Charleston)."}
{"text":"We had two slices of pizza salad and garlic knots , the food was outstanding, the staff working were really cool you could tell there from New York and they really brought the style and tradition of New York style pizza to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"GREAT MEATBALL PIZZA!!! I can't tell you how many times I have passed this place but somehow when it comes time to order a pie it never comes to thought. But thanks to great reviews by my fellow yelper squad I actually remembered last night and so happy I did!

It was one of those nights that I was torn between cooking and ordering out. Since I was getting off late and completely famished I opted for the latter. Called them up and ordered. They asked if I would prefer pick up or delivery. They said 15 minutes for pick up or about 45 for delivery. Normally I am already at home and prefer deliver but since I was leaving work and they are located right down the road I opted for pick up. Remember... I was too famished to cook!

What I ordered... I was so tempted to order this eggplant parm pizza. Sounds so amazing but I decided to go a little more traditional the first go around.  Meatball, mushroom, ricotta and basil. Unfortunately, I was informed they were out of fresh basil but could substitute with dehydrated. No thanks! I have a fresh basil plant so no biggie. Pizza was solid! Meatballs were yummy, good quality mushrooms and ricotta. I really liked the crust. Maybe I am nuts but the crust had a bit of a sourdough vibe that I really dug being the Bay Area brat that I am. It was right up my alley! Also got the cannoli! Two thumbs up!

I will definitely order again... I can't stop imagining the possibility of an eggplant parm pizza! Ooh la la!"}
{"text":"Real NY style pizza by way of Bay Ridge , Brooklyn.  You can't go wrong in this one. It's got the feel and the taste of NYC inside.  You'll meet real NYC people in there just like I did."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in this small hole-in-the-wall type restaurant you know what kind of experience you are going to have. You walk through the glass door which has a printed sign that reads, \"No sagging pants in the restaurant.\" Got to love it, it tends to keep the bad crowds out as well. Then you are greeted by either Ed or Kenny behind the counter. They take your order and tell you to sit anywhere you like. While you're waiting for your fresh food, they will chat with you and I can guarantee that they will get you to laugh atleast three times. Just a really great atmosphere that is family approved and it's getting harder and harder to find in this city. Now to the food... The pizza is the best pizza in town. I've had Broadway Pizza, Villa Pizza, Pizza Heaven, etc. And this is hands down the best pies in town. The wings are better than anywhere as well. My fiance loves the house made ranch and craves their fried mushrooms. Take a chance, try Verrazano Pizza and thank me later. DO NOT MISTAKE THIS LOCATION FOR THE ONE ON FLAMINGO AND RAINBOW. That location is horrible and serves different food."}
{"text":"If you love ny pizza this place is for you ! My job location had moved so it has been a couple years since I've had it.  But I'm not sure I'm gonna want anything else certainly worth the extra ten minute drive !"}
{"text":"This place boasts about being from New York with a New York owner and New York style pizza but it doesn't live up to the hype.

Yes the inside looks like a pizza place back in jersey, yes the staff are cool since most are from the east coast. However the most important aspect of a New York style pizzeria is the pizza. Their pizza is just okay. The suave is average. Cheese is normal mozzarella and if you leave the pizza to cool down for five minutes it's like little Ceasers. Gross. I live for fresh amazing New York staple pizza but man I was disappointed. 

Is it better then most other pizza places in Las Vegas? Yes it is. But that isn't saying a whole lot when you have grimaldis and sabatibos which are better all the way around. If you are from the tri state area this is just not good enough."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Walked in & was rushed to order.. which it's my first time here, was skimming over the menu & I happily won't be returning. I wanted to order a medium pizza because I was ordering wings as well, but they pressured for a large & I wanted to do toppings so the guy cut me off & was saying how I should order a specialty with everything on it.. which I didn't want everything on it. All around, it was a bad experience once we walked in the door. I don't even care about the food anymore"}
{"text":"Yes food is good. I've been picking up pizza for years.   I will never go back though.  They screwed up my order. I called them on it. Told them I would like a rain check. They said ok. Called me back an hour later. Said they couldn't honor the rain check. I respect James for admitting the mistake.  I will not be back. Dom DeMarco's pizza is better.  Reminder to self. Always Check order before you leave. Ie open all boxes & bags."}
{"text":"Again - This is a 3.5 star rating.  This place is good quality pizza - it didn't exactly blow my skirt up ... but it is worth repeat business fo sho.

The pizza is a slightly thick thin crust.  PLenty of real cheese and sausage.  Not too greasy. Folded nicely.  It's good.

It is a small place with about 6 or 7 tables.  Good service - friendly people working in there.  Good prices too.  You can also buy pizza by the slice.

This is good pizza."}
{"text":"We love basically everything about this place and it's our go-to for pizza and wings. The pizza is a great, with a thin but chewy crust, and just the right amount of greasy cheesy pepperoni goodness. The wings are awesome also; made with real ingredients and not chock full of stabilizers like the \"big box\" wing places these days (so gross.) Possibly even better than the food is the customer service. The owner (I think? pretty sure. He's always the same guy who takes our order when we come in...) is quiet at first but then he'll cracks some jokes here and there. But, he really cares about details in things. For example, when you order the bucket of wings, he takes the time to cut out a piece of cardboard to put in the bottom of the paper bag for the cups of ranch, so the bag doesn't collapse and make a mess. Maybe it's a tiny thing but it shows how much they care about details like that."}
{"text":"I don't live here but I know good. Fresh. Handmade pizza and this joint delivers!  I'm sure if I were a regular and knew the menu better I'd give them 5 stars. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but loved it. Tried two pies, veggie and super, both were great! Loved the meatballs, added a very good flavor to the pizza."}
{"text":"THE NAME OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAS CHANGED. THEIR NEW NAME IS RIZOLI'S. The name has changed, but the 'za is the same!

I'm sure that in this sprawling metropolis there are several, if not hundreds, of pizzerias that offer New York style pizza, but until I stumbled on this little hole-in-the-wall, strip mall pizza place I hadn't found any. The pizza here transports me to New York's lower East Side. The crust is perfect, just aching to be folded, but not so droopy and soft that the sauce and toppings slide off before you can get it to your mouth. The sauce is the perfect blend of tomatoes and herbs, spread thinly over the dough, and the edges are just a bit thick and chewy. The cheese is melty and stringy and messy and applied just right, so you can see the sauce peeking through, and the 'za is just a bit greasy (maybe \"oily\" or \"unctuous\" would be better words, less fraught with ethnic innuendo) like God intended it to be. The toppings are the usual, added in just the right proportions.

Of course, there are other items on the menu; pasta, meatball subs, calzones, salads, and (mostly fried) sides. I've only sampled the salad, which is meh, and the garlic knots, which are very good. But eat them all the night you order them! Left to sit overnight, like any garlic knots from any Italian place, they become hard little projectiles one could conceivably use as ammo. There are lots of lunch and dinner specials, and they also serve pizza by the slice, in case you're done shopping at the Sprouts next door and feel a bit peckish. I don't generally drink wine or beer, so I can't tell you if it's offered there. There is a table and a couple of chairs outside the shop in case you'd like to dine \"al fresco.\" The interior design is, well, not really given much thought, but it is scrupulously clean. And they deliver, although if you order delivery, you might wanna heat up your oven to 250° when you order, then put the pizza in, box and all, to warm it a little. There isn't a pizzeria on earth that can deliver a piping hot pizza, though, so no fault, no foul!

The staff can tend a bit towards surly, but that only lends a New York feel to the place, and no one there has ever actually been rude. If you're ordering to dine in or take-out, they'll keep you notified of the wait time.

Plenty of parking, as it's in a strip mall. And if you feel guilty about scarfing two or five slices, you can always stop by that Sprouts on the way home and pick up some healthy food, just to make yourself feel noble.

If you're anywhere near the neighborhood. I highly recommend that you stop by and sample their pies. You won't be sorry (except for that guilt), but you WILL be hooked!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  Count me in the \"Adam Carolla\" style of pizza eating.  That is, when it's time to eat pizza, I want to EAT PIZZA!  And that means I don't want some thick crust weighing me down or filling me up after one slice.  

Verrazano solves all that, the pizzas come on a nice thin crust which is just the right amount of doughy.  I am a pepperoni fan myself but they offer most of the other usual toppings as well.  I will mention I tried the sausage one time and wasn't real thrilled with it.  

Sauce tastes fine to me, they do not skimp on the cheese, and they have a variety of specials as others have mentioned.  Also the guys that work there are great, they always greet everyone and are happy to chit chat when possible.  Also I have a toddler that gets a real kick out of watching them cook.  

If you like NY style pizza you should at least give this a try, it will not cost much and you might end up liking it!"}
{"text":"It was so greasy!!!! It was good after I soaked up the grease. But I felt so guilty eating it. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite pizza place in Vegas. Been coming for a couple years now. It's NY style and it's incredible. I can't say enough about this small little family owned pizza joint. He remembers me every time and it's the little things that keep me coming back over and over. But for real, try this pizza! You'll come back too!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was just a wee little thing, along with my family. I highly recommend it. It's the best pizza in town and definitely the best ranch if you enjoy dipping your pizza and fries in ranch! They also have amazing calzones! 10/10 would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised, goot food, very tasty, high in quality and the portions age generous.
All at very fair prices.
Favourites: the Philly cheese steak on a roll. simply irresistible."}
{"text":"the best pizza i had while i lived in las vegas always good always got the meatball!"}
{"text":"Well...this is definitely a pleasant way to end the year...

So today I went there for the first time.  After hearing so much about it, I figured I'd give it a shot.  As a native NY'er...the only places I'll eat a pizza at is Papa Enzo's (Venetian), Metro Pizza, and Broadway Pizza.  If I want a sit-down pizza, it's Grimaldi's.  

Well, I walked in and asked for 2 slices to the big guy behind the counter.  He walked to the back...and when he came out...another guy from the back came out and offered me a free personal pie that I guess some lady never picked up.  Totally on the house.  I insisted on paying since I didn't even have any cash to tip the guys.  He simply told me to do something good for somebody else.  I can do that.  

Now on to the pizza itself.  AWESOME.  Just like any slice I'd pick up at a corner pizzeria back in Queens.  Being that the gesture was so kind, I already planned on being a steady customer, but you throw in the fact that they make one helluva pie...the deal is sealed.  

Again, to those 2 gentlemen, thank you."}
{"text":"It started off great. The atmosphere is almost identical with NY style pizzerias. The smell of the pizzas cooking in the oven reminded me of NY. I do have to say that their food was pretty sub-par. The sauce was bland and the cheese was almost non existent. The toppings fell off the pizza and it was almost like eating a crusty old piece of bread with bland sauce and toppings. I do not see how this place is considered even to be remotely NY, other than the vast murals of the Twin Towers, this place has a lot of work to do. I am still looking for the best NY style pizza in Las Vegas and so far this isn't it."}
{"text":"I ordered the White Garlic Pizza: olive oil, mozzarella , ricotta, Romano pizza and it was fantastic.  I usually don't like pizza that much, but order it because everyone else does. Since this pizza, I've been ordering it for myself.  Ordered with the pizza was Antipasto Salad: ham, capicola, salami, tomato, provolone, black olive & pepperoncini. Perfect combo! Each compliment each other.  
I waited until I ordered a couple times before writing the review, just to make sure it was the same each time."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had in Vegas. I'll always be loyal to these guys at this Verrazano Pizza (even though one is a Steeler fan and another a Broncos fan lol).

Try the Verrazano special! It's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza shops in Las Vegas! I've pretty much have eaten everything on their menu and I liked it all. Tiny little hole in the wall which is what makes it so great"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Vegas without a doubt. I've been eating there for many years and about to order delivery as I wrote this!"}
{"text":"There are a few Verrazano Pizza's in Las Vegas but this is the realness! 
Im born and raised in NYC and have lived in Vegas for 3 years..this is the ONLY pizza I will eat in Vegas. The owner is behind the counter serving it up, he knew each customer that came in at lunch by first name and has the recipie perfected. 
If you want amazing pizza then forget the rest and come here..its worth the drive from wherever you live.  

Did I mention the cheese??!?!??! Fugghettaboutit!"}
