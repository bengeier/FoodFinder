{"text":"We drove by and thought we should give it a try.  The place is named Diner50 now and we are happy that we checked it out.  I had the fish and it was excellent.  Hubby had a Mexi Burger and he was very pleased with it as well, The owner was super nice and we highly recommend you stop in and say Hello to Andrea."}
{"text":"Great Dinner! Great atmosphere inside. Service that puts the customer first - now isn't that novel in this day and age. Great food made with care. Great prices. You owe it to yourself to check this place out. Glad I found it, I'll be back soon and often."}
{"text":"This diner is closed.  Dumpster is out front.   Bars on windows.  Trash everywhere.  Do not go!  This was advertised as open and an option of a great place for breakfast.  We drove across town just to find it is CLOSED and looks like it has been for a long time.  Non existent restaurant option."}
{"text":"Chanced by this place this morning... WOW am I glad we did!!! Adri undedstands how to run a very busy restaurant! Oh and the fries... 100% the best I've ever eaten. We will be back for the  amazing food.... well worth the drive!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here three times and it has been great each time. Fish fry friday. Jumbo burger. Chick fried steak and eggs. Family owned and very friendly"}
{"text":"Adri and crew at Diner 50 do it up right!  Super cool decor, stellar service and great diner fare at 19th Ave and Buckeye. We'd be lost without them!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, not as much as I would like.   Great sense of community here.  Amazing home style cooking, the guy in the back really knows what hes doing.  Quick, friendly, attentive service.  Good looking chicks that work here.  Prices are great once you taste the food and realize how much effort and care they put behind it.  What else can you look for in a little diner cafe?"}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago. The food was actually pretty good, but the atmosphere was weird. They were playing Me, Myself, & Irene on TV which is pretty much the most annoying movie I can imagine eating breakfast to"}
{"text":"absolutely adorable!!!! we drove all across town because of the great reviews and because i wanted something special for my birthday. the food was excellent, all really fresh and prepared with a lot of skill and love. outstanding service . our server was a real sweethearts, after she heard that it was my birthday, she brought out a cup with delicious ice cream and a candle on top and sang happy birthday to me , all the other guest joined in and i was as happy as i could be! what a great experience."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Food was excellent and generous portion.  Nice simple atmosphere.  Excellent service"}
{"text":"I believe in second chances.  This time, it paid off.  I work right down the street from here and have eaten here once before with a coworker about two years ago.  I will be honest, at that time, it was not that great and we didn't go again.  Needless to say, I did some research and found out that the place had a new cook and new wait staff.  After reading some recent reviews, I convinced my coworker to try one more time.  I told him I had a feeling things have changed for the better.  Boy was I right!!  The food was D-licious, the service was Above and Beyond cool, and the vintage decor was awesome.  The menu offers the right amount of choices yet is simple to understand.  This place did not disappoint.  I will definitely be back and bring more of my friends."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I have been traveling across the country for the last week and Diner 50 has been one of the best experiences yet! The 50's style atmosphere and attentive staff create an experience that should not be missed! I would highly recommend dining here if you are looking for great food and want to experience a blast from the past!!!"}
{"text":"I recently hired Adri and her Charlen's Cafe staff to cater the opening reception of a museum exhibit. It was a big job for over 150 people on a very tight budget, and she worked closely with me to create a menu that fit both of those needs. On the day of the event, both the food and service were fantastic and we couldn't have been happier with the turnout.  A few weeks later I stopped by the cafe to settle my bill, and was really pleased to see how nice it is inside after the remodel. The restaurant looks great, the food is awesome, and Adri and her staff are professional, friendly, and easy to work with. If you need a caterer, especially in the downtown Phoenix area or the South Phoenix area, I highly recommend Charlen's Cafe."}
{"text":"After returning to eat here over the years, the time I recommend it to family the service was terrible. Coffee cup sat empty twice for just over 10 min each time. Others that walked in got food before we did and once began to eat meal, it was obvious it had been sitting. Disappointed with my most recent experience a generally great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ok, I've passed this place a million times over the years and decided to take a chance today. Definitely going to return for the great customer service and wide variety of choices. The decorum and ambience is ."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there for breakfast. The food was good. Service was excellent. Prices were very reasonable. The restaurant was nicely decorated and clean."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a place that just \"wows!\" in every way. My fiance and I, still relatively new to Phoenix, have been scrimping - which means less eating at restaurants and much more home cooking. A few weeks ago, one of his work colleagues gave us a gift card that listed Diner 50 as having a discount, so we were off!  We got there to find this tiny little spot tucked away in a pretty industrial part of town. We would have missed it if we didn't have our eyes peeled. When we walked through the door, it was like walking into a time portal. I've been to dozens of diners - they're popular back in NY- but this one really embodied what the 50s were all about. From the music to the decor, it was all perfect.   After chit chatting with the waitress, we found out that the discount was actually bogus - put on by some company with a poor reputation for listing false discounted prices (it has happened on more than one occasion at different restaurants). As she flew back behind the counter, we decided to leave because we hadn't budgeted for a dinner out (even though the prices are extremely reasonable for those who are not scrimping!). She caught us at the door and she sincerely asked why we were going. When we told her we just couldn't swing it, she ushered us back to our seats and said- \"I'll honor the discount; I'd rather have customers have a wonderful experience and come back again!\".   The menu had items that can be expected at a diner, but the freshness of the food was the icing on top of the cake, It has been hard getting back on our feet after moving cross country; we so appreciate the kindness and the uplifting atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little place with the cutest decor and wonderful food.. highly recommend this little gem. I had a  Cuban sandwich which was FABULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"First timers!  Originally from Vegas, was in town for a few days, looked up 50s diners and this was the location that popped up! A \"Mom and Pop\" shop. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door and seated quickly. Got so distracted looking at all of the awesome decor. We ordered some hot wings as an appetizer, then we each ordered a meal. Got a mouthwatering unsweetened tropical iced tea to wash the yummy food down with. So homey and welcoming, the owner was talking to us like we were regulars, wonderful lady! Even our server, who we were told was her daughter was so sweet and helpful. Thank you for the wonderful experience and delicious food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here again today and had the special, it was very good and a really great deal. I really love the fish special they have here on Fridays, it is really awesome and the price is just as good. This place has really nice ambiance to it. Adriana the owner is really nice and always greets me with a smile when I come here.  All the waitresses here have been really friendly and attentive, the service is really top notch."}
{"text":"I walked in and was warmly greeted first by the A rating from the health department on the front door then by super friendly Adri. The decor is legit, my table had its own RCA/Victor radio. The inside is decorated with records, checker board tile, old school refrigerators... you get the idea, 50's The waitress was welcoming, and friendly. I found her to be super considerate , asking if I wanted to save my biscuit gravey for the pending french fries.  The food, biscuit and gravey.. biscuit was good, crispy, toasted yum, the gravey was loaded with sausage bits. Cuban was good, really heavy...Thumbs up, cool place..."}
{"text":"Great food! The eggs were made to perfection and the bacon was so crunchy. The pancakes are so fluffy and so good! Love the the home fries with the kissfire sauce omg to die for. For sure beats all the well known breakfast places. The waiter Adriana is amazing so kind and is always asking if we need anything. Great place will bringing everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!    I am from Chicago and I was looking for a breakfast place and decided to dine at diner 50.   I fell in love with the 50s themed restaurant the music and food!   I definitely recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok thanx Yelp!! Found this place near the Volvo Semi Dealer. We dropped off our trk to be worked on and was looking for breakfast place. Voila! Kinda funky outside and we weren't sure it was open till someone drove up and entered. We sat and the girl brought us coffee and water. She was very cute and nice.  We had been out late last nite so I wanted small breakfast like oatmeal plus one egg poached. Egg was perfect and oatmeal hit the spot too!  Bf had the cubed steak with grilled onions with potatoes n eggs. He said it was really tasty. So we sat there for awhile as three people came in ate and left. We chatted up the waitress with doggie stories and about the Restaurant. Found out her Mom owns it and they did the decor which is really kewl. ( old records on wall , pix, memorabilia etc. ). We finally got ready to go and we had our dog in the rental car so she came out to see her. And of course who doesn't love a Yorkie??!!!!  I bookmarked this place.       Well been here two more times while in the area in the last two weeks! Omg I love this place for food ole' American Diner food. I love the bacon cheeseburger (twice) with their fries to die for. Milkshakes are real thick with ice cream too! Bf had Pork chops dinner one time and chef salad next with meatball stew. Btw everything was sooooo good. The Mexican lady cook is very consistent with everything. Brenda the daughter / waitress is very fun to talk to. Cute as a button too!  So we conquered and look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great little diner! Great food. Really friendly staff. The food takes a little longer, but when you taste it, you know it's sooooooo worth it. This is not a Denny's or IHOP. The cooks take pride in their creations. Can't wait to go back for the Friday fish specials."}
{"text":"Delightful diner! Wonderful service and terrific food, I had the Chicken fried steak...it reminds me of the southern food in Texas! Adri was my Server, she was absolutely perfect well mannered and professional."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I had such a great time! The reviews led me to Diner 50 and it did not disappoint!  I was welcomed immediately by the sweetest waitress! She was energetic, bubbly and the smile never left her face. She seemed like a genuinely happy person! Gave the place such a great vibe!  The food was beyond incredible! Cooked exceptionally well! Definitely order some fries while there! I had ordered a burger which came with fries, but they were so delicious I ordered two more sides of fries!  The decorations were so authentic and fun! You could just walk around for hours looking at all the cute little details! The pool table was a great plus!  Everyone needs to try this place!! It was so wonderful that I HAD to write a review! (I made a yelp account just for this! ;) )"}
{"text":"I recently went here because my boss is a big fan. I always loath going to work-related lunches because I hate the distraction that ensues when I have to inquire about their vegan options. Diner 50 does not have vegan options, but they worked hard to prepare something especially for me that was vegan and even made a point to cook it on a non-contaminated surface. The server who handled our order was very cool about it."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the way home from vacation. Staff was welcoming and friendly, this place is super cool and the food was delicious! Highly recommend it!  If you're in the area or from out of town it's a \"must eat\" place. You'll love the 50's ambiance as well as the food. I'm giving this place two thumbs up thanks Diner50."}
{"text":"Good home cooking, large portions. They are remodeling and under construction but that didn't impact their Great food and even better Customer Service."}
{"text":"On my way to the airport with my roommate and we got really hungry. Yelp showed up Diner50 and boy was it a good decision. Amazing breakfast and environment. Decor is pretty cool and staff is awesome! Will be back when I fly back in!"}
{"text":"Great service! Clean restaurant. Very unique restaurant on the inside. Fast service. Food was good. The Old Fashioned came out quick, very delicious. The pancakes smell heavenly."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place no stars.. Waited over 30 minutes for food. Was about to leave and food miraculously was ready.. A gentleman came in after and ordered after us and still got his food before us. Then when we started eating, the waitress' family comes in an gets immediate service. Definitely NOT coming here again. Heard good things about this place and was SORELY disappointed!"}
{"text":"We found this gem while trying to find some place for breakfast and now will be a regular.   The staff is more then amazing making you feel like a regular the second you step through the door.   But the food is best part. My corned beef hash for the first time in years tasted like its supposed to, corned beef and potatoes. The home fries were perfect. My daughters French toast and hash browns made her smile a lot.   Coffee was perfect and kept coming.   But the cup of tea blew us away. They understand tea.   Put this place on your must go list.  A real 50s diner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the staff is super sweet and attentive. My husband had the ribeye and loved the seasoning. I had the pancakes and they were fluffy and super tasty. We will definitely be back to explore more options!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot! Nearly missed it. Not from around here wasn't familiar with the area. But we'll worth the u turn. I like that it was real food real good."}
{"text":"today is the last time I will dine at this place. food is good. I made the mistake of ordering a side of home fries. much to my surprise, I was billed $3.50. They advertise a $2.99 breakfast of 2 eggs, toast, and home fries. I will not recommend this place, in the future, to any of my friends."}
{"text":"We were driving by this diner, and we were some what skeptical. However, the fist assumption could not have been more wrong. Walking in we were pleasantly greeted by an amazing waitress who was so sweet and had great recommendations on what to order. The vibe in the diner is so real, tons of regulars and old movies, oldies songs. Besides the vibe and staff let's talk about how AMAZING the food was! Omg, I ordered a BLT.... it was so good. (They gave a good real good amount of bacon too!) I can't want to go back!! Thank you for the old time feels!"}
{"text":"This place isn't just an amazing Diner. It's a place where you can go to have a full experience. The food is always on point, breakfast is my personal favorite but everything is great! The staff are the absolute best! You can go ahead and try to just order your food without jumping into conversation with the staff, it won't work.  The staff really play the old 50's style diner part, very kind and bubbly. This is a place that you have to go at lease once. I did and now it's a place I go to relax and have a great time."}
{"text":"Diner 50 exemplifies the old adage that you cannot tell a book by its cover. I have driven by Diner 50 dozens of times and all I saw was an older looking building with bars on the windows in an industrial area. Looking for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, I saw the high ratings from Yelp members and decided to give Diner 50 a try.  The parking lot is ample size and is easily accessible. Entering the restaurant, you notice a clean, well light area with plenty of seating and a lunch counter. The décor is thoughtfully done 1950's kitsch. Service is super friendly. Breakfast, lunch and dinner items are on the menu, though closing time is midafternoon. According to the server everything is freshly made. My wife devoured The Sinatra, an omelet with bacon, mushrooms, spinach & Swiss cheese. It comes with a side of spuds and toast. No problem making the omelet with egg whites. I enjoyed a patty melt, a burger on toasted rye bread, with Swiss cheese and caramelized onions. The side of French fries were from freshly cut potatoes. Menu has many options to choose from. The Phoenix area has very few diners to eat at. Check out Diner 50."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, then add the great food you have a winning combination  Yry the Home fried potatoes over the hash browns !! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I came here years ago, I just happened to pop in on my day off, hungover as ever, and I've got to say I was in heaven!  It was exactly what I wanted that day, it was genuine home cooked breakfast just like my grandpa would have made... the second time I went I had a date and Adri and helped break the ice and was funny and charming, and I had the most killer chicken fried steak ever. Needless to say my date wanted to go back the next week, and we'll since then Adri has seen my all of my meaningful day after dinner dates ;) I don't live in AZ anymore but best believe when I come home, I don't beeline for any cookie cutter breakfast spots, I'm not expecting a first watch omelette, I'm CRAVING Diner 50, and it's authenticity of a home cooked breakfast, that perhaps my date should have made, but not only does the food satisfy my breakfast or lunch needs, Adri and her staff always make time to catch up with me no matter how busy she is. I have zero complaints and can't wait anytime my plane lands in the 602"}
{"text":"This place is looks like a dump until you walk in the place. Good friendly service .And the breakfast is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been trying go to eat at Diner 50 for a few months. When I have time for breakfast I drive by and it is closed. When I am in a rush to get somewhere I drive by and it is open and busy. MLK my husband and I tried to go and it was closed. FINALLY last week I had the day off and it was open!! It was delicious! I tried the Marilyn omelet, a pancake, and biscuit with gravy. I wasn't a fan of their gravy, but everything else was delicious! I brought my husband with me today so he could try it too. The sign says they open at 7. We went at 8:30. The lights were on, the tv was on, the door was locked. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is charming, but the inconsistency in the hours is quite annoying! If you drive by and the open sign is lit go enjoy some good food! But don't plan on going unless you have physically verified that they are open, because 2/3 of the time they are closed."}
{"text":"I'm really bummed about having to leave such a low rating because the service was GREAT! The food...not so much.  Since it's a diner I decided on something greasy & fried, like chicken strips & gravy, my usual at these kind of places.  The gravy was delicious but the chicken strips tasted & looked exactly like the cheap ones that you buy in the freezer section & heat up. Really bad.  I could tell these were def not hand breaded which was disappointing.  My husband got a grilled ham & cheese sandwich which he said was good but pretty greasy. As for the service, they were all so sweet but the food didn't wow us one bit. Sad to say, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My uncle tony used to bring me and my grandma here every sunday it was one of the best places to get a cheese burger and milkshake then wed share a pie but that was back in thr day when a kind older women used to work there went recently and a younger blondie was super rude and felt as if we where annoying will not be returning sadly"}
{"text":"This is our go to neighborhood place for breakfast and lunch. The staff is so nice and attentive! Place is always clean! Their 50's decor is pretty cool. Their prices are very affordable and the food is excellent! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the desert. Diner 50 is very clean, well decorated and family own cooking. From the moment you enter the restaurant you feel welcome.  The menu is very well diverse. I enjoyed the 50th decor and music."}
{"text":"A very unassuming place especially for where it is located & outside appearance-bars on the windows & door. Not a place I would have tried. Co-worker raved about the Friday Fried Fish Special. It was ok, fish is battered in corn meal which makes for a crunchy crust. Service was a bit lacking the day I went-under staffed, a few tables not cleaned off. Decorations were cool-that old 50's diner feel."}
{"text":"Discovered this wonderful breakfast and lunch spot about a year ago and have been hooked ever since!  Delicious home cook food - sandwiches are great!  BLT is my favorite.  Service is very personal and attentive.  You must try this place!"}
{"text":"Fun place with a great breakfast on a Sunday morning. Good service and nice people too! Skip iHop and Denny's for breakfast and try it. Now it doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside will surprise you."}
{"text":"I loved this little place. Dont get to this side of town often, but if your close, take the time to try it especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"Let me just start with this, the staff was great and service was good. I came in because of the high rating and it is close to work. I had breakfast and it was ok, but the cheese was oil based and not the quality I usually want. However, I had seen pie a la mode on some reviews so I ordered that as well. The slice is half of a normal slice first of all, and the pie was so old you could taste onions and lettuce in the crust from it being in the refrigerator and uncovered for a long time. Even the ice cream was old. There were ice chips in it and I was not able to take more than 2 bites. I had few friends with me and they had the pie, same opinions and did not finish. Unfortunately will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So excited back in town to visit family for spring break, they know how much I love Diner 50 and they surprised me as soon I got in town! We all had different meals but my favorite was definitely the delicious chicken tenders but next time I'm gonna get the mushroom swiss burger bcus my cousin had it and said it was bombdiggity"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is absolutely adorable and the food is fantastic, best breakfast I have had in a very long time! The atmosphere is fun and they even have a functioning 50s pool table! Just a great place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I will most definitely be back to visit and we will recommend Diner 50 to friends and family!! The decor is so cool (free pool for customers) the food was absolutely delicious and the service was beyond amazing. Our server and hostess made us feel so welcomed during our entire visit. I had the Denver omelette, wheat toast and home fries and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"They have such fresh quality and their food is made to order! The service is great, cuz they are super friendly & happy to see you:) the fun 50's decor and great atmosphere make it a definite stop for lunch in downtown Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical about this venue based on it's location. I was quickly turned into a believer when I stepped foot into the diner. Flash back to a real diner from back the 50's. The service was friendly and the food was delicious. They have a house made salsa that was to die for! My husband loved the Denver omelet with home fries and my A1 breakfast with pancakes was huge! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We almost didn't walk into this diner since it is being remodeled on the outside and is in an \"interesting\" location. My husband almost drove by bc he thought it was a muffler shop. DO NOT let the outside scare you, it's absolutely adorable inside!  We had breakfast and it was simple and good. The owner/waitress is charismatic and \"just fits\" the decor. This is a great place to eat if you're looking for something near the airport. I'd definitely go here again! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A well deserved 5 stars and then some!!! Every once in awhile you get customer service that is so exceptional, it changes your whole day; combine that was DELICIOUS food-- SCORE!!! - that is exactly what Adri and her team accomplished today!! I had a large group order and was looking for a restaurant that could accommodate a delivery.  Adri took my order, was kind enough to let me know when it was on its way; Gabe delivered our delicious food and was just as pleasant to interact with.  Thank you, Diner 50 for the stand-out customer service and the yummy food!! You made a group of busy 911 dispatchers very happy today!! Can't wait to stop by and see the restaurant in person!! :)"}
{"text":"Large portions, tasty food, fun atmosphere, and super friendly staff! What more can you ask for? Highly recommended this little joint."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a big breakfast person. I love trying new breakfast joint, especially local mom & pop joints. A friend introduced me to this diner, & I have to say hands down the best in Phoenix & not to mention they have To-Go for breakfast, lunch & dinner. The hospitality is beyond amazing, food no words can explain how fresh & excellent it is! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I check out Diner 50 with my family today for a late breakfast! It was AWESOME!!! Food is fresh and taste so good!  Not mention the customer service is AWESOME as well :) I will definitely give them my business and you should as well if your in the area!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's exterior is probably a deterrent for some, but once you get inside you get to see the level of detail incorporated into providing a rustic, classic American vibe. Breakfast on a weekday was not too busy and the service was superb. The \"A-1 Special\" at $7.99 is a great deal and offers bigger portions and better tasting food at a cheaper price than its chain-diner counterparts. This place is a definite gem!"}
{"text":"My family decided to check this place out based on the suggestions of friends and the yelp reviews. The only disappointment was that we hadn't come to eat here sooner! The diner had a cool atmosphere and was very clean.  We had great service from start to finish. Our meals were all delicious and I especially liked the French toast.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found it on Yelp, with 4 and half stars, in a run down neighborhood but do not be fooled! Amazing food, prices and service! Very comfortable atmosphere ! Highly recommended for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place and keep coming back for more! The food is amazing! Adri makes the best bloody marys ever! Adri and Brenda are awesome friendly waitresses that always are welcoming. Come and enjoy the home comfort food and atmosphere. The restaurant is vibrant ,old school feel . Many records and decor to view."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast, BLT was excellent,  great service,  super cool vibe! 50's throwback with great oldies! Kids under 12 eat FREE Saturday w/paid adult - we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I ordered a BLT and it was pretty good although the fries were soggy and tasteless. Service was pretty good and I liked how they play 50s music and it's just loud enough to enjoy without having to tell over it to talk to who ever you're with. My grandpa had the cod and he said it was cooked well but he prefers catfish which Charlen Cafe sadly doesn't offer anymore."}
{"text":"Super stop after arriving at the airport when our whole family was ravenous on the way to Glendale. We had a range of food from homemade oatmeal to BLTA to a cheeseburger and vanilla shake. It was all delicious and done with fresh ingredients. The waitress took her time to explain the menu and chat a bit.  We averaged a little over $10 per person. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Omg, what a great place! Awesome food and great service. A little smoky but very cute."}
{"text":"Haven't even eaten here yet but the 50s memorabilia is terrific and makes you walk around to see it all. My favorite is the Bob Hope Cigarette ad. Now the French dip I ordered and it too is great. Recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"This place is eye candy for those into 50s and 60s memorabilia and basic, good diner fare.  The service is great and friendly. Very good hand cut fries, omelettes, shakes etc. It's on the way from the airport to the Grand Canyon."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  Like real Americano.  Should be on Dives & Diners!  Love the 50 decor and the friendly staff.  Great BLT and meatball soup."}
{"text":"Found this little slice of Americana by accident. As we drove up the outside did not show much, but inside we found a warm and inviting diner. We seemed to have transported back in time to the 1950's. Vintage tables, chairs and a juke box. Very friendly staff and an amazing breakfast. Our party of four all had something different and it was all hot, well presented and delicious!! We would highly recommend this place for a tasty, heart"}
{"text":"We found this place as a recommendation from a stranger.  In Phoenix for a friend's graduation from Grand Canton University. Wanted to eat at local places instead of chain restaurants.  We'll on our drive to the location we were kind of wondering what we were getting into.  But as other reviewers say, don't judge a book by its cover.  It's a local \"hole in the wall\" cafe.  But the breakfast was delicious.  The 10 of us each ordered different items.  All were great.  Waitresses were very friendly an accommodating.  The restaurant is decorated in 50s music theme.  Definitely better than any Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews we stopped in after a really early flight in from the east coast. The location is kind of run down / industrial. The place is fifty's themed, down to the waitresses in costume, and the background music.   Steady stream of regulars while we were there, police, utility workers, etc...  Every one of the staff seemed really happy to be there, very friendly and helpful  The food was very good for a diner breakfast, fresh and prepared very well. I had hash, eggs, and home fries, frau had a southwest scramble on a tortilla with hash browns.  My only tiny complaint was that I would have liked a second piece of wheat toast.  Based on our experience I would recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a friend come in from out of town and we decided to try something new. We were kind of hesitant at first because the outside isn't too shabby, but once we entered it was like totally stepping back in time. This place has a very fun atmosphere and the food was great! I will definitely be coming back and bringing family and friends with me."}
{"text":"Great place with great food. I like the Diner 50 style. The pancakes are good. the Omelet  was great, crispy hash browns. pork sausage patty was great.  Adriana, the owner served us at the counter and offered homemade hot sauce/ranchero sauce for our eggs and hash browns.  She needs to bottle that stuff it is so good.  I was almost going to give one less star because they did not have Cholula hot sauce but the homemade sauce more than made up for it.  ;) The food is cooked to order and with fresh great tasting ingredients.  You have to give this place a try. Great food, Great service.  Check out www.facebook.com/TheCharlenCafe There are several photos and reviews. They also help homeless, starving children and Vets! Now that is a small business I can support."}
{"text":"His was nice find.  Met a colleague here for a quick breakfast on the way to a joint call we had and to our surprise, it was quite nice.  Well...not that we were expecting it wouldn't be, especially from all the previous reviews - this joint was well spoken for.    Our breakfast's were spot on - cooked just like we asked them to be.  Seems like a simple but not all breakfast joints get this...we've all been there ;)  Also worth noting was out waitress. She greeted me as soon as I entered although she was very busy and working the front of the house solo) with a wArm and fun energy.  I always appreciate that!!  She had a great sense of humor and definitely made our little dinning experience memorable.   The decor is authentic and original / and the music  rocked!!  I love it when places like this break the norm and put their own signature their establishment - it just exudes pride.  I love it.   Enjoy Phoenix."}
{"text":"This Diner is the best Go-To for breakfast, Lunch & Dinner! Customer service is A-1, quality food & it's delicious! The vibe is so retro, I love it!! Definitely recommend!   Hands down best restaurant in phx!"}
{"text":"Good food with a twist.   Enjoy the atmosphere and talking with the server and ppl around me."}
{"text":"Decor is spot on for the name, straight out of the American idea of the 50's. Menu options are limited,  but the pancakes were awesome. The were preparing fresh fish for the Frday fish fry which they always sell out of. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This s a great spot for breakfast, I had the spinach and feta omelet and my husband had the chicken fried steak. He loved the gravy, the service was great very friendly. Try their in-house hot sauce it is great a little fiery and a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Came her based on previous reviews. The food was great. You can taste the fresh ingredients. The service was great as well until toward the end. It was starting to get busy and we waited a while to get the check but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in! I drive past this place multiple times a day m-f, as I only work just a few blocks down 19th ave. I always see cars outside and their attention grabbing signs for the fish fry, coffee, best diner, etc. So I stopped in with a manager from my job for lunch, and look over the menu and I'm pleasantly surprised with the varieties to choose from! I chose to order the \"Chicken Fried Steak Burger\" which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, and a side of gravy, with fries and a Dr. Pepper. My burger had no mayo, and No side of gravy and my chicken fried steak taste like fish, so I can only assume it's fried In the same oil as the fish fry? and the soda tasted like the place had no filtration system for the water, my manager orders a bacon cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and also a Dr. Pepper. He ended up with Bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a Luke warm bowl of chili with ice cold thick processed shredded cheese on top. Now normally I would be slightly irritated and ask for the items to be corrected when the waitress returns but unfortunately the waitress never returned after serving the plates. Eventually though another waitress came to our table and we expressed our issues with her, and she made sure to give us the whole rundown that well it's her day off and the other girl is going home sick, and that's why our orders were screwed and everything else. So bottom line we were whatever about the place but what really ticked me off was how rude and sarcastic the second waitress was especially when saying \"I'm going to give you guys two coupons for next time, wait you guys are gona come back right? Or would I just be wasting them?\" All in all I won't be returning and will probably suggest to everyone else to stay clear of Diner 50 (2 stars only because I was quite surprised by the interior despite what the outside looks like/ and for the chef having a beard net)"}
{"text":"The quest for an awesome breakfast diner has come to an end.  Great interior, and great personable service.  Nice menu selection, and they know how to make omelettes, home fries and hash browns. (You'd be amazed how many places can't get those staples right, but I guess Phoenicians don't care.)  We will be back - can't wait to try their albondigas, or their Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Diner 50 after happening across their Yelp profile. I don't need to spend time talking about the menagerie of memorabilia that fills this quaint diner in south Phoenix. I'm sure you, the reader, have gathered that from the pics and other reviews. Very cool little spot, though.  But what I do want to talk about is the attentiveness and warmth coming from the staff. I wasn't 2 steps in the door before I was greeted by the two young ladies working the floor. They both shot me a smile and a \"Good morning!\" before offering me to sit wherever I'd like. Don't misunderstand, the place wasn't empty and they both had guests and were both doing their thing, but they made sure to personally invite me in. I took a seat at the little counter, got a warm wink and a smile from the little gray-haired lady who I'd assume either owns the joint or runs the kitchen (the kind of endearment that only a grandma knows how to throw at you) and had coffee and water delivered by my young waitress within seconds.   The menu is not overly-extensive but it is complete. I knew what I wanted before I even got there so I ordered the chicken fried steak with a side of bacon and sausage. Food came quick, the gravy was very tasty and you could cut through the crispy fried steak with a fork. Wonderful. And the hash browns really caught my attention. The seasoning was delicious. Some might want them more lightly seasoned but the flavor was awesome. I know. Hash browns, right? But they were really good!  So, I enjoyed my breakfast while listening to classic tunes fitting for a 50s-style diner and though a steady flow of patrons came and went, I never once felt neglected or rushed. I paid my tab and was invited to hang out for as long as I wanted. It was a very pleasant meal. Today was my first visit but it was undoubtedly not my last and I will certainly be bringing friends to enjoy the place with me, again and again.  Keep it up, Diner 50. You're an unpolished diamond in the rough of South Phoenix and I wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"We order the omelette supreme and the chicken fried steak it was awesome. But the service was slow. We also order a short stack, but it never came. The food was Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere is wonderful. My son  and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in the get-toe, take yo' phat ass to Diner 50. Cool retro joint, nice staff, adequate diner food.  You'll find it on 19th Ave somewhere between Van Buren and Buckeye. Someone told me it was there and I saw it with my own eyes. It's amazing inside! (Notice how I avoided speaking of the outside.)  Not seeing a veggie burger option on the menu, I put in a special request for one of the burgers sans the meat patty. My preference for vegetarian eats was accommodated quite well with good customer service.   They fixed me up with a sand-which actually turned out to be a veggie sloppy joe of mushrooms, zucchini, onions, and peppers on bun with lettuce and tomato. Juicy! A side of medium hand cut fries with skin on (yum!) came with.   And for my sweet tooth - uh, I mean for the owners - just to let them know that the sign out front with 'apple pie' written in big letters was useful, I also ordered a slice of dessert.   Dessert First Dessert First Dessert First (That's going to be the next movement I join. You should join too, it's very proactive.)  By the way, other restaurants in the area are fast food and Mexican food."}
{"text":"I found this place by using Yelp and saw the great reviews. So glad I stopped in. The menu has many choices. The food you can tell is home cooked. I had the tuna salad and even the croutons were freshly prepared and delicious. The waitress and staff were very friendly and I absolutely loved their outfits. I will definitely be back to check out the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The staff is very attentive. The decor is cute and fun. I ordered a tuna melt and fries and it really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back to try their breakfast menu next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So happy to find this gem in Phoenix. The fries are double fried and they are amazing. We had a couple of hamburgers and they make them fresh and they are cooked to order. Absolute perfection. The wait staff were courteous and attentive. Even the plain water had cucumber and lime in it. The decor is neat all decked out in fifties style."}
{"text":"This place is amazing in both food and service smiles from e everyone from your arrival till the end.Niceee menu with great prices and big portions. 50s cool including the music snd interior"}
{"text":"Just searching through yelp for a place for lunch and found this hidden gem of a diner! The food was good and the service was speedy got my food in about 5 mins! Will definitely be back to try this place again."}
{"text":"Such a gem in Phoenix! The service is excellent and there is a lot of choices on the menu. I love the decor and the service was sooooooo nice!"}
{"text":"We stopped here randomly and it was an absolute gem! The service was friendly and funny and clearly happy to be at work. It's a comfortable atmosphere and they make you feel like a regular even if it's your first visit. The decor is adorable! The food was really good, normal diner food. Picking is totally reasonable. I would strongly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and I wanted to try something other than a chain. I liked the reviews so my son and I came here for breakfast.   It definitely is different. Has tons of 50s memorabilia as well some old timey games. I think it's a little overboard yet others may enjoy it.  I had the breakfast sandwich and my son had an omelet. The food was good and decent portions yet it came to almost $30 (w/tip and drinks). For your standard breakfast, I thought it was a little high yet being it a mom n pop place, you gotta pay the bills.  Not sure if I'd go back yet if you're in the area, not a bad place for breakfast if you want something unique."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. The atmosphere is so excellent and the service is very good. When you are here everybody is very friendly and the customers are very relax like you are at home. Come out and try it for your self's."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and let me tell you the breakfast was great and for a cheap price. Had the biscuits and gravy special with 2 eggs and bacon and home fries husband had the chicken fried steak breakfast and coffee and ice tea $22.00. Was very impressed will go back for sure."}
{"text":"MY 50th REVIEW!!! And what better way to celebrate the milestone than writing a review for Diner 50.... My coworker and I discovered this place while heading back to the office from a meeting.  You know what was discovered in the 50s?  DNA....   The place is BOMB!! Just like the construction of the Hydrogen Bomb in the 50s.  It was very clean, and well decorated with a 50s theme.  Pictures of the 50s can be found all over the place, and they have a TV that plays shows from the 50s.  Speaking of TVs, the colour TV was introduced during this time and so was the TV remote.  The restroom was also clean and well decorated.  This place is definitely very inviting, quite suitable for royalty, speaking of royalty Princess Elizabeth became Queen in the 50s.   The staffs was super friendly, funny, and attentive.  The service was overall excellent.  I don't remember how long we had to wait for our food because we got distracted with all the decorations and the pool table.  We had so much fun shooting pool, we thought we were at Disneyland.  Did you know Disneyland opened in the 50s...  The food was delicious, we ordered from their breakfast burrito menu, and the burrito ordered was delicious!! Much better than McDonald's, speaking of them, did you know McDonald's was found in the 50s.  Anyways the burrito was so delicious my heart almost stopped.  Fortunately for me had that happened I'll get a transplant done.  BTW the first organ transplant was complete in the 50s.   After we finished eating we paid with our credit cards, (Thank goodness for the introduction of credit cards in the 50s) so we could leave, we needed to rush back cause our lunch break was over, so we had to speed away.  Don't worry we buckled up, fortunately the car seat belt was introduced in the 50s.    Overall a wonderful experience and I hope you all enjoyed this review and learned a few things."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little gem in a very busy town!  Not every day can I say that the service was as good as the food. But here you feel like family! And the delicious food is a A+ in my book! It truly feels like it's a meal that your family would have eaten in a dinner in the 50's. Good, hearty portions for the price! Our waitress went above and beyond by letting us sample a pancake that my husband and I were debating about. When we come back (and we DEFINITELY will be back), we will be getting an order of pancakes! They are buttery and golden brown. Simply delicious. Thank you everyone at Diner 50!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! The 50's theme is so much fun, they really put some thought and detail in their decorations.  On top of the atmosphere Adri who helps run the place is amazing, she gets to know her customers and is always friendly and fast to bring the coffee.  The breakfast is awesome, the biscuits and gravy are on point and I'm a true snob when it comes to my breakfast.   They're fast, friendly, extremely well priced and delicious, I've definitely found my new favorite breakfast joint.   Stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING!! Adri was a phenomenal waitress that treated each table like they were the only one in the place. In addition, I have severe meat allergies and they took those completely seriously and even cleaned the grill before preparing my food. Oh, and the food, the food is out of this world. Perfectly scrambled and fluffy eggs, crispy hash browns, and the most incredible hot chocolate and coffee. Lastly, their prices are very reasonable, especially for the quantity of food you are served.  If you're in Phoenix, definitely check this place out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I came across this place by searching breakfast places on yelp. I read so many great reviews and decided to give it a try. So glad that I did! The service was outstanding. They changed the TV for my daughter so she could watch spongebob while we ate breakfast. The food was super delicious! It's a cute little 50's themed place that's  charming all around. I will definitely be back for sure!! Hidden gem on the south side of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've never been so pleased at an off the wall spot! Staff is wonderful and attentive! My tea came in a cup big enough for a proper serving! Food was perfectly cooked. At atmosphere can't be beat! You feel like you have gone back in time! For sure a new favorite spot for me in the Phoenix area! Must stop and check out!!! Everything here makes you feel like you have walked into your family's home! Staff welcomes you like you come in everyday! Sure to put a smile on your face and leaving happy and stuffed with wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to eat because the theme is awesome and the service is great as well. The staff is so nice and makes you feel welcome. The food is great too! I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Glad to have found this place. I had a yummy breakfast. The decor, staff, and food are awesome! Excited to go back and try lunch."}
{"text":"Step into the oldies area. Perfect dinner decorations, from walls, table, kitchen and even floor. Super beautiful. Might be family own,one of the waitress (not at our table) had her small child cleaning tables at one point she told her she was \"In her way\" this was sad. Uncomfortable to see and hear that. Children should not be at parents work place... Food: appetizer was good. It was hot, fresh, plenty of ranch and spicy (hot wings). Actual meal was disgusting I order Philly steak sandwich and fried. Sandwich was dry, meat was tough and burnt. Two other people got fires one was also burnt the other undercook not to mention one meal was mis order. I will not be coming back to this restaurant. Side note the only reason I have two stars is because of our waitress she was young, friendly, full of life. You can tell she had fun waiting our table. She apologized for the mix up and that made all the difference for this diner."}
