{"text":"Their breakfast sandwiches have guided me through many a hangover. Cali club, breakfast club, smoothies, all good stuff. Price is on the higher end for sandwiches and such, but good ingredients and quality  taste are there."}
{"text":"Spoiler:  Go! But not the through the drive through.   What a great find after last night's culinary fiasco. Food is fresh, fast and delicious. Even their salsa was great tasting! Coffee was smooth and delicious as well. The crew was super busy, but all very friendly and helpful.   We sat outside and ate and were surprised that we didn't witness any car accidents. The drive through traffic is insanely busy and until you can get in the lot your car will be hanging out straddling the bike and right lane. The staff seems to do a super job of taking orders and delivering orders car side however."}
{"text":"1 word: Delicious! Seriously...healthy and cute. I'll be honest...I've only tried the breakfast buzz (most delicious protein shake ever). I promise you that if i'm ever in south Scottsdale for lunch or dinner d'lish will be my first preference. I've looked over the menu and everything looks wonderful. I live in east Mesa and work in north Scottsdale...I go out of my way to get a buzz and will continue to do so. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Consistently great service, and fresh, healthy food.   Everything I've tried has been above expectations.  For wraps, salads, smoothies, I've tried most of the local spots and this is my new go-to place for quality and reasonable price.  Very clean."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is amazing, I love the California Club breakfast sandwich and the orange smoothie. I highly recommend D lite!"}
{"text":"Quality, strong coffees. Hot day?, try an iced toddy!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time the other day. I was a bit nervous that it'd be busy because it was a Sunday morning but there were still spots in their baby parking lot. Their drive thru is poorly placed for other drivers trying to park but their ordering system makes the line go pretty quickly. My friend and I ate on the patio. They was plenty of seating outside but little seating inside. The food and drinks were great! I had a breakfast croissant sandwich and an orange glorious smoothie.   All in all the restaurant is appropriately named. The food and drinks are indeed d'lish."}
{"text":"The Turkey sandwhich was one of the best i've ever had! D'lish is a hidden gem in Scottsdale! Very small, but cozy inside. I tried the turkey sandwhich, and had some ice tea to accompany it! By far one of the best lunches i've had! The service was excellent, I know I will be going back when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"This place is everything and more. The staff is always extremely friendly and wear smiles constantly. The food is to die for. I've been here a plethora of times and have had a pleasant experience each one. So yummy. And the atmosphere is cozy and warm. I love this place."}
{"text":"The only way I would eat at this place again is if my front door was less than 60 feet away from their entrance.... and I was a quadriplegic confined to a wheel chair for the rest of my life. Seeing that there are no residences that close and I can walk, I can confidently say I will never give this place a nickel again.  I walk in to blaring reggae music, which is fine, whatever...but of course I have some douchebag in front of me with his girlfriend slowly dancing to the reggae music for a full 90 seconds while they are deciding what to order, if you want to groove to the music for 5...maybe 10 seconds, fine...but I'm hungover as fuck dude, quit dancing and order your gay salad with raspberry vinagarette and granola all over it. if I had any wish in the world at that very second I would have not wished for a million dollars or world peace, I would have wished for a hammer to instantly appear in my hand so I could hit him in the side of the knee as hard as possible so he would stop dancing and scream so loud that I wouldn't have to listen to the loud reggae music anymore either.  I order an egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and an orange juice.  Orange juice arrives at my table first. It was basically sunny delight orange juice. This establishment has the hippy tree hugger organic feel to it and you idiots can't make fresh squeezed orange juice? The sandwich comes a full 8-10 minutes after I order it. It was small had a small egg not that much bacon at all, whatever on the cheese, and sourdough bread. This all cost me 10 bucks. Place is a fucking rip-off. If you had brought me my simple order in less than 24 seconds (not 10 minutes) and had fresh squeezed orange juice (not 3 bucks for sunny delight). Then ok charge me 10 bucks and I'll be moderately happy, and would maybe return to eat there if I was 2 mins away from dying of starvation and happened to be driving by.  Then some guy walks in who I guess was the assistant coach of the ASU basketball team or something and one of the tree hugging hippy waaay too exuberant employees starts yelling \"clap everyone its so and so from wherever....\" and then made some joke like \"go UofA\" or something to mock him sarcastically. Shut up you dumb shit, I'm trying to consume your shitty 10 dollar egg sandwich in peace. Go smoke a bong in the back of the restaurant like you probably usually do anyway, or go stand in front of your restaurant with a sign saying you want it legalized so I can run you over on my way out. Then I leave and I'm walking to my car and reggae dancing douchebag from earlier is feeding his girlfriend from his fork on the outside patio. Ugh. Everything about this place made my head want to explode.  And all you people who give this place 5 stars should be immediately transferred to the island of molokai like they did with all the people who had leprosy decades ago. Except the new colony will be for morons."}
{"text":"Love this place its healthy, fast, close to home! No matter what I order it's always good and I leave satisfied.  Breakfast favorites are California club and oatmeal our way, coffee is pretty good and they have almond milk.  For lunch... Man salad,  chicken breast panini and southwest bowl!!!  Cons Pricey Small location They close at 4"}
{"text":"\"BE\"yond impressed with the quality of food and service! The food is clean, the atmosphere is inviting and the prices are ideal! If you thought fast-food had to be unhealthy, processed, greasy, etc... think again! D'lish makes eating clean on-the-go feasible and affordable! My personal faves are the soups and the portabello burger :) wait.... the Humanitarian is great too....  Enjoy! It is D'lish!"}
{"text":"MY DREAM PLACE - healthy fast food!  I tried the Scottsdale location on Saturday for the first time - had the Protein Burger, Early Bird style, and it was so delicious.  Also had the dirty chai (has a shot of espresso) - so good.  Today I had the Signature Tuna Sandwich from the Tempe location, and thought it was excellent.  Everything tastes so fresh and has such distinct yummy flavors.  I saw the Tempe location didn't have many reviews and a lower rating so I wanted to try it out for myself.  I thought the food was just as good, and as I live in Tempe, I will be frequenting that location.   The drive-thrus seem kind of slow and ridiculous, but eh, that's ok -- worth it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Buzz is the best espresso drink I've ever had, not like a lot of the shakes with protein where you can taste the whey"}
{"text":"Love this place, I got the breakfast club, and my wife got the turkey club and butternut squash soup. Everything was so fresh and tasty. We will come here again when in the area! Also the coffee was fantastic, no need for cream or sugar."}
{"text":"Very clean, quick and friendly service. I got the veggie supreme humanitarian wrap-- really good! I will definitely grab lunch here again!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about D'lish! My fiance and I have never had a bad meal here and we've tried nearly everything on the menu! The services is friendly and fun. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing. And, the food out of this world!!! My favorite is the Man Salad and California Club - hits the spot every time. For a guaranteed good meal, check out D'lish!"}
{"text":"The California Club was pretty good. Their iced coffee is really bad. But what I'm most hung up on is their service. I went with my coworker to pick up a couple orders for the rest of the office; I forewarned the woman taking the order that it was going to be a couple different orders - on different cards- she reassured me that it wasn't a problem. Obviously, it became a problem. Another woman came to the window and snipped that if we wanted to make several orders we should have came in. They were not nice about it, and became obviously flustered. I felt badly, I know what a pain in the butt it can be. However, they were not nice - very rude and I felt my business was not valued. Needless to say I will not be going back; not because the food was bad but the service was very off-putting.(1/28/16) Went back today because those idiotic women charged my card twice. The manager there, however, was as nice as can be and gave me a gift card and was extremely apologetic. Looks like I will be coming back. (1/29/16)"}
{"text":"Have eaten from the drive thru a few times, great healthy-ish, fresh tasting sandwiches. I had the club and the chicken sandwich and both are good. The menu is really simple, wish they had one or two more choices on it, but overall, I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed my first cup at D'lish.  After reading the other reviews from the Yelpers, I decided to go with a Dirty Chai with Almond Milk.  Great choice.  I am not a huge chai fan and I will definitely be getting another in the near future.  Very good.  Very pleasant atomosphere and the customer service was very welcoming.  I decided to sit and work a little and enjoyed my chai so much that I ordered a latte to go.  Excited to try this one, but wanted to update my Yelp before I hit the road."}
{"text":"Food is super tasty. Always. So tasty.  Coffee is slightly above par, with lots of options.  Service is molasses slow. For a drive thru, don't bother unless you have at least ten or fifteen minutes to spare."}
{"text":"Need a fast, yummy, CHEAP, breakfast burrito in the morning?  This is your place.  And trust me, I am a bit of a bfast burro connoisseur.  I've been perfecting them since my freshman year in college.  This place almost has me beat.  I've tried all three varieties; chicken sausage, bacon, and just eggs/cheese/awesome potatoes.  they were all d'llsh.  Additionally, the drive thru was quick, easy and enjoyable - staff is extremely friendly.   Great stop for a quick, yummy bite pre-work, during-hangover, or post-bank over-drafting (it really is cheap!)."}
{"text":"Best place ever! I am very happy to know that there is a drive thru that is healthy and fresh. I just drove up with my dog in the back seat, and everyone wanted to give her a treat. Very kind and friendly people; I am seriously going to come here all the time!      Eye candy tehehhehheheheee"}
{"text":"Dlish is adorable! I have driven by many times and wanted to stop, but they are always closed because I am driving by at like 330 or 4 pm. This morning I woke up and needed some strong coffee, so I went to Dlish. I got the Veggie Burrito... AWESOME! Completely cured my hang over, soaked up all the alcohol! And The red eye completely woke me up! I am going to go back there for breakfast as much as possible. I am little disappointed in their lunch menu. It is lacking in vegetarian options( I am not a fan of egg salad sandwhichs and I am sick of the hummus craze!). I just noticed on there website they will be doing dinner soon- SO excited.   I wish there were more little precious places like this in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for the active.... Yummmm. Very quaint and even a drive thru if you are in a hurry but definitely not fast food type quality."}
{"text":"Had a co-worker do a breakfast run this morning for a bunch of us and I had the Cali Club for the 3rd time & it was D'lish as usual! Can't go wrong here.."}
{"text":"Today was my second time there. Tried the California Club and the Turkey Club. Both were excellent! Iced green tea is so refreshing."}
{"text":"This was my first time at D'lish, and while I normally don't eat at organic, healthy diners, this was a pleasant experience! I didn't have to wait to place my order, and the cashier answered all of my friend's questions quickly and courteously. He was also very patient in waiting for us to decide what drinks we wanted since we hadn't planned on getting any until he asked.  The dining area inside is very small, but we were able to get a table even with the area pretty busy. There were plenty of spots to sit at outside, as well. While waiting I noticed that the music was a little too loud. It made talking with my friend difficult at some points. The atmosphere of the place is very chill, though, and it lends to casual dining.  Our smoothies arrived in a few minutes and our food was there shortly after. I ordered the berry smoothie, and it was very tasty. My friend ordered the strawberry-banana smoothie, and it was just as good. For food, I ordered the California Club. It has egg, bacon, turkey, pepper jack, cream cheese, avocado, tomato, and pesto on Artisan bread, if I remember correctly. It was fabulous! Like I said, I don't tend to eat healthy food (I'm a meat and potatoes kind of girl), but this definitely hit the spot. Everything tasted fresh, and I really enjoyed the cream cheese addition. I didn't notice much avocado on the sandwich, though, but I also wasn't inspecting it very closely. My friend ordered the Chicken Breast Panini, and he says it was \"delish.\"  The employees noticed we were sitting around talking, so they came by and picked up our plates and trash to free up some space on our table for us. They were very polite and asked us how the food was. When my friend mentioned I was a Yelper, the employee seemed delighted to hear that. I mentioned that there were good reviews for the place, and he said that he reads them often. It's always nice to hear that businesses pay attention to what is being said by customers!  Overall, I had a great experience at D'lish, and I'll be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"My boss picks up Burritos and Fruit smoothies from this place quite often. The food is always good but not mind blowing. I see this as being a great quick stop breakfast. Worth the stop in if you don't have time to make breakfast. I will be returning on my own accord for burritos for hiking and such in the future."}
{"text":"Having only eaten here once, I'll give it 4 stars.   The good: had a tuna fish sandwich on toasted sourdough. Yum. Food tasted clean. Also scooped up a Breakfast Buzz (vegan) smoothie. Peanut butter & banana. Daumnnn so so good. I make amazing smoothies everyday in my Vitamix and this murdered my recipe. It has me jonesing for more less than 24hrs later.   The bad: this isn't their fault, but entering southbound from Scottsdale Rd at 1130am on a weekday is a nightmare. Parking is minimal. Restaurant is small.   Big complaints: blender running constantly, and due to the small size of the establishment, it makes conversation super difficult and annoying. I hope they read this review and consider moving it to the back.. (hint hint). Sandwich portion size was somewhat small, and my friend got a wrap that looked small as well. We both ended up buying the Breakfast Buzz smoothie after eating our lunch because we were both hungry.   Overall, the food is bomb. Super clean, healthy, unique recipes. Don't plan on coming here for a quiet date or a meeting. The drive-thru is the way to go, it seems, and ordering ahead would be my advice as well. I'm definitely going back. Sooon."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices for food that's a bit healthier. The drive thru is very convenient so that's a plus. Will defiantly be back, my only complaint is I wish they had more of a variety for the kids menu."}
{"text":"Love that theres the option for in-house dining or drive-thru, and everything is made-to-order right in front of you. Have had a few smoothies here-- my fav is the coffee/mocha one, and their bfast sandwich and bfast burrito are delect."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. The salads and sandwiches are fresh and everything seems fairly priced considering the quality of food.   Though the drive thru is often packed and can be tight with the small parking lot around it, I love the concept of getting fresh quality food in a fast drive thru and it's totally worth the wait. I wish there were more D'lish restaurants in the valley, but not if becoming a chain would sacrifice their quality of food :)"}
{"text":"I would say, it's' a good place for lunch. My Southwest rice bowl was okay. Not bad but also not fantastic. Not many tables inside, but they have a patio with umbrellas."}
{"text":"I had the frittata and the espresso shake. They were both delicious. The service was great, the prices very reasonable, and you can either drive thru or eat in. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Food and prices were good; however, I walked out of here with a receipt for $15.13 that ended up on my credit card as $35.13. The service wasn't bad but definitely not worthy of a $20 nonconsensual tip."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is awesome. I love local coffee establishments. The place had a really homey feel to it. The art design on the wall gave the place a unique feel. They're hand drawn and painted, which separates itself from the Starbucks mass-produced art work.   I loved the fact they used Pandora as their music source. Lots of great collection from indie musicians.   I ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste. It was just great! Their menu is VERY healthy.  The owners are very welcoming and great to talk to. I like how they interact with the customers which give it that personal connection. I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang!!  This place has potential. They are expanding their menu so watch for goodies within the next couple of months. They buy a lot of their produce from local farms which help sustain the community - I'm a big fan of that!!"}
{"text":"This place has a drive thru which makes for some fast service on the go. There is a great shake called the \"breakfast buzz\" which has some coffee in it too. They food is above average at best but does the trick."}
{"text":"I ordered an California club for to go and got burned bread and bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today for lunch with a few co-workers, great food, great service and very friendly staff.  Two of us got the California club (signature sandwich) and it was delish!!! Seemed very lite going down but was filling.    My other co-worker had the salad and was very happy with it as well.  We also all decided to try the breakfast buzz- which has vitamins, peanut butter, bananas with chocolate and espresso shots...   we are awake and ready to go!!  I don't consider myself a real healthy eater, but I felt like I had some healthy food for a change, and didn't feel at all that the flavor or taste was lacking like some good for you food does.  Overall great experience and looking forward to seeing what else we can try next time. I will definitely be back and let others know what they missed out on :) and they have a drive thru and call in..."}
{"text":"Good place to take your young out-of-town guests to show you're still hip. Not a good place for us senior citizens. The music is so loud as to be painful. The staff are disdainful of older folk. The food is strange hard core healthy. Might be good spot to cure a hangover."}
{"text":"Really good and would go back again.  Just can't justify 5 stars when the service was decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  The breakfast buzz was worth the flight from Michigan, but the food seemed a bit over priced--2 drinks, a California Club and a bowl of quinoa for 22.50, you decide."}
{"text":"Great concept with the drive thru healthy, alt food. Had the oatmeal - it was very tasty. Good coffee but went a little cream happy. Didn't try the shake but prob should have. Point deducted for no bathroom if you eat there, otherwise very solid little breakfast/lunch stopover."}
{"text":"Friendly and playful staff that work hard to deliver good service considering their small space and almost always busy  Everything from their dirty iced chai to their quinoa burger is AWESOME.   If I am on a time crunch and the line is busy I go somewhere else but other than that, their food is always worth the wait.   I am so glad they decided to put a D'lish near campus but a little badgered that they did it my senior year when I am about to graduate in a couple of months!  By any means, I love this place. One of my favorite lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out today since I'm a huge fan of breakfast food! I had heard good things and the menu seemed promising.   I ordered the Croissant Sandwich. I wouldn't say the guy behind the counter was very friendly and it looked like he could have been the manager. He acted like he just wanted to take our order and get us out of the way. But he could have been having a bad day, who knows.  The sandwich was good. I wouldn't say it was outstanding or better than any other breakfast sandwich I've had. Plus it was $6 for a pretty small sandwich... Honestly, I probably could have eaten another one to fill me up. I ordered berry green tea and I'm pretty sure they gave me traditional black tea. Either that or their berry green was very tasteless/didn't taste like green tea at all.  So I'm giving this place three stars because they definitely have the right idea! Great menu options, drive-thru, nice outdoor seating area. Customer service could have been better, but I'm not going to say it was bad after only one experience. Portion size was not substantial for how much the meal cost, but I can't say that's surprising for a healthy food joint.  Not bad! But could have been better."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I found this place on Yelp and so glad I checked it out this morning. The food and coffee were great and the prices are so low. The staff was very friendly and made great suggestions for us. I am already planning on going back tomorrow to try something else!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I live right by and I love that they have a really healthy menu. I have two friends that are picky eaters, one gluten free and the other vegeterian and this place is perfect for both. They have a menu that specifies which items are vegetarian and which items are gluten free (so we don't have to annoyingly ask a hundred questions like we do at other restaurants). I like D'lish because I'm on a 'mostly protein' diet and they have plenty of options for me- my favorite is their Man Salad and their Breakfast Buzz (which is an awesome espresso drink mix with protein powder). Great prices and nice staff..I will keep coming back:)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious I go here at least once a week. The main reasons why I love this place is that the food is healthy and fresh, great prices and fast service! My favorites would be their breakfast burritos, quinoa oatmeal and frittatas so yummy! My boyfriends favorite is the club sandwich which is super good too."}
{"text":"This food stop has gotten it right!  The food, customer service, atmosphere-everything!  I had the California club with avacado and split a daily buzz protein shake with my date.  Absolutely fantastic!  The guys working there were really friendly as well.  My only complaint:  the parking.  There simply isn't any room.  Had the parking been a little better, a 5 star rating would've been given."}
{"text":"I've waited along time to check this place out. The green lemonade smoothie was the best I've had! The issue with this location is the poor customer service.  I may or may not go back again purely due to the service. Every employee I encountered was rude, didn't even thank the customer.  They all need a lesson in customer service. Hope the management monitoring YELP notes this review."}
{"text":"We've been for breakfast - breakfast sandwich was super yummy and just recently tried lunch.  Recommend the tuna and turkey club sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced and has great fresh food.  Everyone is really nice.  Great for breakfast for lunch.  Veggie friendly which is a plus!  I wish there was a place like this where I live."}
{"text":"I have ate here everyday since Day1. Move over Pita Jungle....I have a new love. The food looks an tastes.fantastic!! Cactus blossum tea. get that everytime. The soups\ LOVE Love them. its all good.very crisp an clean inside an out an a much needed addition to this area.."}
{"text":"Great food and EXCELLENT customer service. They often have long lines since they make your food to order, but they said they doubled their staff since spring training and have really improved on efficiency. You can also call in your order to pick up if you are really pressed for time. Parking is pretty terrible because they have such a small place that you have to wait for a clearance in the drive-thru line just to leave. However, they really try hard to get the drive-thru line orders in quickly and even send someone out to take your order before you get to the order window."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fresh food, friendly service.  Great little stop. Could use a good cleaning, but if you can overlook that, you'll love the place."}
{"text":"Purchased a soup and two sandwiches and it cost me over $30! Kind of ridiculous considering how bland and boring the food tasted... Also it was definitely not worth the 20 minute wait in a drive thru that is falling apart! If you charge people so much for the food I'm sure you would have enough money to spruce up your location and make it easier to drive through."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! The food always comes up quick and everything I tried is amazing, especially the tuna salad sandwich. The smoothies can't be beat and everyone is super nice that has helped me. Will keep going back and back.."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place before!?! I had the breakfast club and it was AMAZING! Great customer service, quick and healthy eats.. what more do you need?"}
{"text":"I tried this place to try to eat healthy. Nothing to rave about. I guess my expectations are higher cuz the name pretty much says a lot but wasn't impressed with the sandwich and juice...it's ok."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Woke up on New Years with a craving for a breakfast burrito. I only have 4 cheat days from paleo a year, and New Years is my last one. I ordered the AZ Burro. First, they forgot the turkey. Everything was mixed together, there was way too much feta, and I couldn't tell if I was eating rice or potatoes and couldn't take the eggs at all. It was all extremely bland, even the salsa! Also, super long wait and the burrito was lukewarm."}
{"text":"My favorite is the low carb breakfast!!   I have to eat here at least once when I visit my daughter.  It's D'Lite-fully d'licious!"}
{"text":"After seeing the size of the parking lot, I was pleasantly surprised with this little gem! We were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff. The \"man\" salad was wonderful! The ingredients were all fresh and the tuna was delicious! The prices are great for the quality of ingredients and the portion size. The sandwiches looked awesome! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Don't bother reading my review, just go to D'lish and enjoy yourself some awesomeness in and around your face."}
{"text":"Was expecting much better of the nuts and berries salad.  Turned out to be very mediocre.    The place is very popular though.  Every time I pass at lunch hour the drive through is jammed back to Scottsdale Rd.  It's very likely you will have to drive a few blocks up the street to park.  I can't imagine how much business they lose on a daily basis due to the inconvenience of the parking lot/drive-through.    Anyway, friendly enough staff but it took a while to get my food, they nickle and dimed me in charging for adding a few raisins to my salad, and the salad was very average."}
{"text":"Great food for the people who want to eat a healthy diet without the guilt. I go there everyday to get my breakfast buzz without the espresso! Definitely makes my life easier and I have so much energy the rest of the day. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quick healthy fix."}
{"text":"Killer drive-thru breakfast spot. Love the Breakfast Buzz, really kick-starts my morning with the heat of one thousand suns. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hard enough to find organic restaurant, these guys have a drive-thru. It can get over-whelmed during breakfast time they need to expand."}
{"text":"The food at D'lish is super fresh and real tasty!  Recommend the breakfast club and a coffee (drink menu is on point).  For lunch, the tuna sandwich or turkey club are awesome!  If you don't want to wait in line (drive-thru line can grow fast, parking lot has about 10 spots), then call your order in, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had the turkey club without tomato, very good. We also had a large house smoothy. Which is strawberry banana. I was very impressed with both. The smoothy was five dollars and the club was tiny bit over 7 after tax. That's the reason it didn't land a five . I feel like the food should have been 5 and the drink 3.50. Very small place and little bit dirty ."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, the man and I headed out to get breakfast, enjoy some coffee and have a lazy read of the day's paper.  He wanted to take to me to the place he stops at many mornings on his way to work, but alas, it wasn't open until 11am.  (Side note: A coffee shop that doesn't open til 11am?  On a Sunday?  Really?)  We looked at each with blank faces.  Where to go now?  We needed breakfast, coffee, wireless internet and a place where we could relax without feeling like we were preventing a server from turning the table.    So I said, \"What about that little shack place further south on Scottsdale Rd.? You know the one that says coffee, breakfast, lunch on the sign outside.\"  He said something along the lines of, \"You're a f*$@ing genius.\"  His colleague had apparently been recommending this place for weeks and he hadn't tried it yet.  D'lish as it turned out to be called, was exactly what we were looking for.   As we walked up to the front door, we passed a lovely but small patio.  I was instantly charmed.  All along the patio are planters with homegrown tomatoes, herbs and other yummy garden delights.    When we walked in we checked out the menu and waited our turn.  Not sure who helped us but I'm assuming the two guys who we spoke with during our visit are Chad and Kyle.  The bf and I ordered the same thing: two breakfast croissants and two lattes.  The latte was great and satisfied the Sunday morning coffee craving.   The breakfast croissant?  Just delicious.  A fried egg, bacon and tomato with a light layer of pesto on the croissant.  Seriously delicious.  I don't know if I ever would have thought of pesto on an egg sandwich but I'm so glad that D'lish has broadened my culinary horizons.    The bf was equally satisfied with his meal, but did remark that he thought $6 was a bit expensive for a breakfast sandwich.  I think we paid a reasonable price for a quality product.  It is apparent to me that with a limited menu stocked with fresh ingredients, a garden on the patio and their status as a CSA drop off point, D'lish is trying to churn out food that is as fresh, natural, local and organic as possible.  Yay for them.    Chad and Kyle were nothing but friendly and welcoming.   A number of regulars came through while we were there and it was obvious they have quite a loyal following.  D'lish is small, no more than 20 or 30 could fit in the place.  However, they also have a drive thru to serve customers on the run.  We'll be back and hope to be regulars soon!"}
{"text":"I recently just went there for breakfast and spent $18 on a breakfast buzz a turkey wrap and some sort of soup The breakfast but it was melted the tomatoes in the turkey wrap were old and they tasted horrible and the soup was cold never going back there again waste of money"}
{"text":"I am a foodie from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I encourage D'Lish to open a cafe there. The food truly is fresh, flavorful, prepared and presented with care. The only thing that detracts is the extremely loud noise that overwhelms the eight table inside dining area, every time a smoothie is made. I worry for the hearing health of the employees who must tolerate this throughout the day. So 5 stars for delicious and healthy  food, and 5 Bells for uncharacteristically rude noise."}
{"text":"This place just isn't for me. All my friends love their breakfast sandwiches (as do most) but I don't like their eggs and I feel it's a little pricey for what you get. Everything comes with avocado and they have absolutely no room for cars during busy hours. If you're in south Scottsdale it's worth a try as you'll probably like it. 6/10 on the hipster scale"}
{"text":"D'lish in Scottsdale has been on my list to try for a long time, so you can imagine my excitement when they moved in two blocks from my house. They provide a good option for coffe and food on the way to school, but I can say I am rarely comfortable in this establishment. They don't have shade on the east side of the building so in the morning the majority of their inside seating is out of the question. It is always either too hot or too cold inside and the music is consistently just a little too loud. This place is small! You don't need three spakers. That being said, their food is pretty good. I really love anything with their hashbrowns inside. AND you can get bfast any time of day. I certainly won't be going too often....the prices would break this grad student's bank. Also, I often get the same drink order, and I feel like I am always paying a different price. Obviously they are still working some things out, but I just have never had so many small complains about a place. Also, I haven't checked recently, but for a while their sign read \"free trade\" coffee instead of \"fair trade\" coffee....gotta get that fixed!"}
{"text":"We'll certainly return when we're back in town! The only thing 'fast' about this fast food is that the service is quick & efficient! Great local concept!  Like: AZ burrito! Chicken breast panini Toddy - cold brewed coffee! Ambiance - informal & one can tell it's a local favorite!  Wish: We had one in Riverside CA!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this location and boy was my experience an anticlimax. The sandwich was one I could have made with little effort. It was pleasant and light, but by no means the best sandwich I've ever had. Would not recommend highly."}
{"text":"What a great find! Coffee is strong and tasty. Oatmeal is very good as are the breakfast sandwiches with very fresh and high quality ingredients. Efficient, prompt and very friendly service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Menu is small but sooo good! I find myself going there on a more regular basis just to keep trying different things on the menu."}
{"text":"Had the frittata this morning - AWESOME!!!!  Not the same 'ol breakfast for sure!"}
{"text":"Great local sourced food, with creative twists.  Plenty of healthy and vegan options, and don't forget to try the Breakfast Buzz"}
{"text":"Love the Breakfast Buzz, just wish the taste was consistent from server to server. My only rub against this place is the parking. I prefer to walk in and go to the counter. More often then I'm in and out before most cars have even placed an order.  Update on my initial complaint   Can't fathom how they can't get their signature drink consistent each time. It's like the employees just guess. Really disappointed that the Buzz I was looking forward to this morning was over powered by the amount of espresso poured into my drink. It can't be that hard to post the recipe by size right in front of the blender fir the employees to follow."}
{"text":"I just picked up lunch for my coworkers and they cant stop raving about how good the food was!  Everyone is already talking about going back.  I had the \"man\" salad and it was amazing.  Packed with good protein and gluten free, not to mention so fresh and tasty!  I'll have plenty of energy for a good workout after work and no stomachache from lactose or gluten.  Plus, the employees were friendly and upbeat in spite of the lunch rush.  Yes, the drive thru line was a little long, but completely worth it.  Great job, D'lish!  I'm so happy to find a fast, healthy local restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't like to trash a place based on one bad employee, but I don't think I'll go back here.  I went here with a friend. We place our order and sit down. A few minutes later, our waiter takes our drinks to a table across the room. This table realizes they have the wrong drinks and returns them to the counter. This is no big deal, I won't freak out over this. The waiter then brings the drinks (with the same straws used by the previous table) to my friend and me. I ask for new straws. The waiter then tells me \"I just made these and I took the paper off of the straws.\" Why did he lie about this? I try not to make a scene, but he continues lying to me and refusing to just get two straws for a full five minutes before I reveal that I have watched where the drinks have been, I know that he did not \"just make\" them, and he was not the one handling the straws. He makes a scene and lays into me with a very sarcastic tone. I didn't eat too much of my meal. When your waiter lies about sanitary issues and mocks you in front of a crowd, your appetite goes away.  This was probably my fifth or sixth visit to D'lish. In the past, the service has been okay and food is pretty good. But I have no problem with never eating here again."}
{"text":"5star breakfast! It is my second time coming to D'Lish and i just more in love with the food and service. The popularity of the restaurant is amazing! #healthy #organic #cantnevergowrong"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. It is a unique spot in a not so likely area, just one the things That keeps me coming back. Not mention they also offer great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food here is  mediocre! Some healthy options & close to campus. I like that they have vegetarian options. I feel that the Employee's at the Tempe location need to be trained on ingredients and allergy information! They seem to be pretty clueless! Also went to the drive thru at 3:30 (they close at 4) and the guy at the drive thru said to me \"you are lucky that you didn't come any later or I would be pissed\" RUDE!?? As far as I am concerned you are open until 4pm. So you work until 4pm."}
{"text":"Yes, there is a party in my mouth...a breakfast party!  Definitely one of the best breakfasts I ever had.  I enjoyed the arugula salad with hash browns, eggs, and bacon (all in the salad, not separate).  It might sound weird but was fantastic!  The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the abysmal parking/drive-thru situation.  Words that best describe the situation I cannot use on Yelp....so I'll just say I had to make a 500 point turn to get out of the lot, and those in the drive-thru line were none too helpful in letting me depart.  I will definitely keep this in mind on my next trip--or buy a smart car.  Patio is dog-friendly, food is fresh and fantastic.  Just don't park in the back--and enjoy D'lish!"}
{"text":"Even though the drive through line is always long (sometimes all the way out to Scottsdale road) is worth waiting for that delicious Cali club sandwich."}
{"text":"I honestly have only had the morning buzz with almond milk and it's my all time favorite!! The man salad is great too!! Healthy on the go!"}
{"text":"I really like their breakfast buzz shake. Chocolate, peanut butter, banana, coffee, protein, ice. So delicious! And can be a quick meal replacement. This shake is one of the few foods I dream about. If I'm in Scottsdale, I try to think of a reason to stop by.  I also like the quinoa oatmeal. Very light tasting but filling. Quinoa gives you protein, chewiness, and a slightly nutty taste.   Downsides: not too much seating. Parking lot is small. Drive through line can be long. None of these keep me away."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the recommendations posted for breakfast-didn't disappoint! Fresh, hot food with reasonable price AND healthy! From out of the area but wish there was one in Seattle-I would definitely come back.  This will be on my list for future trips!"}
{"text":"This place fills a gap that is definitely needed in the area. Fast, delicious, and relatively cheap breakfast food and coffee. Yesterday I had the low carb breakfast in a tomato basil wrap - warm eggs, fresh greens, potato, and pesto sauce. It was fantastic! The iced coffee was smooth, almost-carmely (not sweet), and delicious. I highly recommend this place any day. Oh, and they're open early!   Beyond the food, the place looks great and has a beautiful patio. It stands out amongst some of the eyesore plazas of Apache. The only down side - they close at 4pm."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!!! There are no healthy drive thru places so right away that's major points. Everything on the menu is delicious, literally. I've never ordered anything I didn't like from the AZ burro to the Top Notch protein burger (made with black beans and quinoa) to all their tasty teas and drinks. It doesn't matter what you get you're sure to be satisfied! I hope this place stays open for years to come!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is off the chain.  EVERYTHING is so fresh it's insane.  High-quality local ingredients and all super knowledgeable staff definitely make this place a must-visit if you're in this area."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast croissants here. Friendly and fast service, and a small business feel. The iced drinks are also a plus!"}
{"text":"I have driven by Dlish about a thousand times and about two weeks ago stopped in. AMAZING I have since been back close to a dozen times. The food is awesome breakfast, lunch if it's on their menu it's sure to please. Organic, local and awesome friendly staff makes this one of my new faves"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Love the low carb breakfast, and the drive thru staff recommended their amazing seasonal smoothie. This place does a great job getting healthy meals out as quickly as possible without skimping on quality. I'd rather wait in a line of cars here than at in-n-out (no offense, just feel better about the options here)."}
{"text":"Place is awesome.  Was in town on business for two days a couple months back and looked for a breakfast spot for the first day. Found D'lish on Yelp and ended up going there both days because the Breakfast Buzz drink was out of this world good.  It's a combination of peanut butter, bananas, espresso, chocolate, milk, proteins and vitamins, blended cold. Got it with soymilk and it was still great.  Sandwiches are solid, four-star worthy. But the Breakfast Buzz is six-star caliber. And the service was great. Fun, relaxing place to get some work done and they also have an unusual drive-thru, which could be convenient."}
{"text":"This place is seriously delicious! I am addicted to their Pomegranate Green Tea and Kombucha. I went three days in a row last week, but have one complaint... They were out of large drinking cups all three days. They also have great sandwiches. Popular tiny little place. It's better to go through the Drive-Thru because of parking issues."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING is delicious.  I have tried half the things on the menu and I would order everything again..  My favorites are the AZ breakfast burro, the Veggie burrito and the Humanitarian wrap.  You can make anything vegetarian.  Their iced coffee is my favorite in town!    As a heads up, they have peak times that are super busy and there is little to no parking to speak of.  Their drive-through is fairly efficient.    Definitely my favorite quick, healthy restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome concept, love the idea of a health-conscious fast food joint, but as far as \"fast\" goes I think they could speed up their game for their drive-thru just a bit.  Last few times I ordered food through the drive-thru it took about 10-15 mins for a drink and breakfast sandwich.  Plus, when I got the sandwich it was just a little bit sogalicious. However, today I thought I'd give them another try and sit inside.  Was a little more impressed with their service and food this go-around.  The guys working were cracking me up, very witty and sarcastic--kinda like the personable attitude of a West Coast coffee house; super laid back like hanging in a friend's kitchen.  I ordered their traditional breakfast burrito and it was very D'lish, not soggy but very hearty and filling, eggs were perfectly seasoned and loved the flavor of the salsa.  Definitely willing to try this place again, but from now on I'll probably sit inside or put in a pre-order.  Really wish their hours went a lot later through the evening instead of closing at 4pm. I think they could probably triple their business if opened at night given the location.  Update 08/25:  Just gave this place an additional star...I've been more and more impressed w/ DLish because they've definitely sped up their drive-thru game!  I look forward to continuing my dining business with them again and again!  Would rather support local cafés over any mega-tron monopolies (*cough* Starbucks).  Also, just recently tried their blackbean and quinoa burger...ummm yeah, very DEEElicious, super ++ !"}
{"text":"I like this place for there drinks and sandwiches, but there burritos just have way too much egg in them. I guess if you are a huge egg fan you'll love their breakfast burritos, but I like to keep it at a minimum. I usually order the turkey BLT or tuna sandwich which are both great. They are quick and keep it casual and friendly. They even have a drive thru which I've never used, but if you are too lazy too get out of your car and don't mind wasting money on gas it's perfect for you!"}
{"text":"Long wait unless you call your order ahead, but so worth it!  Delish food, tastes great, very healthy, portions which leave some for the next meal.  This is food that makes you like it not just when you eat it, but after as well!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure why they have a drive through when they can't operate it properly. I waited 15 minutes after ordering for a breakfast buzz.  I was the first car followed by a long line of people who also ordered beverages only. They all managed to leave before I did. There was no reasoning as to why I had to wait so long for the same beverage numerous vehicles had ordered after me."}
{"text":"Just flew into Phoenix.  This was the perfect treasure for breakfast.  Be sure to park down at the bar.  Worth the walk! Would have take photo but we scarfed our food down so fast. This is a must if in this area!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and food is stellar.  Second time in and had the nuts and berries salad with chicken.  To die for!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the food here is great. Love everything about it.   The problem appears to be the workers. About a week ago I stopped in to get a coffee after dropping my wife at work. I was told it would be $1 and some change. I signed my receipt that said $1 and change and went home. Later in the day i'm paying bills and see the charge from D'lish as $6.56 on my bank history. All i got was a coffee. So the cashier at the drive through clearly screwed up. Everyone makes mistakes so I'm not to bothered by this.   However, A week later i go back for some burritos and breakfast buzz. Everything seems hunky dory. Fast forward to the next day and I'm at work when i receive a call from someone who says they were in line behind me the day before at D'lish and they have my debit card. I look in my wallet and lo and behold I was given someone elses debit card when at delish the previous day.  Now i can forgive an overcharge. It's easy to fat finger a cash register but to give away my debit card to someone else is completely unacceptable. Part of the blame could certainly be on me for not checking but if you're operating a business I'm trusting you do things right. The fact that you messed up twice within 2 weeks is almost unforgivable. Still not sure i'll ever go back. If I do I'll definitely be bringing cash"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, as I just moved to Scottsdale, but the low carb breakfast was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't tried most of their food. Definitely casual."}
{"text":"So freaking delicious. Bit my tounge trying to eat too fast but good food and great shakes. Really enjoyed breakfast this morning. Dont hesitate to try its bomb!"}
{"text":"Healthiest drive through option ever. They actually cook! I am at the Scottsdale location at least once a week. As a creature of habit, I generally only order the same thing....the seasonal turkey sandwich called \"the gobbler\" with this amazing cranberry goat cheese spread. Not sure what I will do when they change the menu.   They have assorted iced teas as well: green, black, and cactus pear or cactus blossom. These are excellent when mixed with black tea. The last time I went thru, I noticed they had a \"doggie bag\" option, which is chicken and wild rice. That's an awesome option for anyone who takes their pet anywhere.  Additionally, this place is small.... But if the drive through is backed up, the guy that works the first window will come out with spare menus and take your order on the spot. I don't think I have ever waited more than 5 min for food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go after the gym, excellent menu and cool contemporary interior. Breakfast buzz smoothie, the Chicken Breast Panini,  and the Turkey club are all great choices if it's your first time in, but you really can't go wrong for fresh healthy nutrition. Staff are friendly and know the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've spotted this place while driving down Scottsdale and saw it had great reviews on here and had to try it.  They have drinks, snacks, bfast/lunch items that are creative and tasty.  Healthier and more nutritious than others nearby.  Fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"A buddy and I stopped by for pick-up on our lunch break a few days ago. I had their southwest rice bowl. It was alright...a little on the soupy side, with too much of the enchilada sauce and not enough chicken. It came with blue corn tortilla chips, which sounded good...the bag contained maybe 10 chips? Really? Again, it was alright...I could probably make this at home. It was also a little on the spendy side for what I got. I'll give something else on their menu a try next time."}
{"text":"Good food. Quick service. Went there for breakfast and was very pleased with our oatmeal and breakfast burrito. Yum."}
{"text":"Sat at the drive thru window for 10 minutes today without being acknowledge (after reading other reviews this seems to happen often). There were three employees at the counter inside, all of which looked at me but no one came to help. Eventually, after the cars behind me left, I left as well. Only to show up to work late and hungry. I know how delicious their food is but my experience today has changed my views about the place. So disappointed.."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I am obsessed. The best items on the menu are by far the Breakfast Buzz (protein shake with coffee, peanut butter, and banana) and the California Club.   I usually dread going to work on Mondays, but a quick drive through at D'lish gets me ready for the week! It's so convenient for my schedule that they are open at 6am.   Lots of locals are catching on to how awesome this place is, so the line hangs out into the road often times during lunch hours. Also very busy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Had postmates deliver to me this weekend and my egg sandwich was inedible. It was completely burnt and I added chicken sausage to the sandwich, which I had thought they forgot to add because I only got 3 pieces total on the sandwich!  My breakfast buzz was great as usual but I'm pretty disappointed that I couldn't eat my sandwich. Posted a picture just so they could see this inedible sandwich."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from here is so delicious and fresh tasting, and the drive thru is a big plus. The bialys are amazing, especially in the breakfast club. Turkey club is also 10/10. All the staff is super friendly. I had my dog in the car and they were all so excited to see her and give her a treat. Great experience overall and would highly recommend. The parking lot can be a little cramped and annoying, but that's not really their fault."}
{"text":"The food is healthy and fresh, even if a little pricey. My favorite thing to get is the lunch combo: Humanitarian w/chicken and portabello mushroom soup. The California Club and Turkey Clubs are also pretty good. I tried the Oatmeal and there was too much milk for my taste; I like the quinoa oatmeal I make at home better. I also wasn't a fan of the Nuts n' Berries or the Kitchen Sink salads Good teas and coffees. And OMG that Breakfast Buzz!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The Oatmeal our way is magical, toddy's (super charged coffee & espresso) are better than any Starbucks concoction, and the breakfast buzz will hands down change your life!! They say dynamite comes in small packages and this little place is no exception!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito w/ chicken sausage and kombucha or breakfast buzz.  Order it.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"I generally crave the breakfast buzz shake at least once a week! As far as the breakfast sandwiches, you can't go wrong. I alternate between the California Club and croissant sandwich. Great little breakfast/brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Eating here now this place is great super health love it the man salad is the way to go they are not open late but a great lunch and breakfast place"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday morning.  Its a drive thru spot but I parked and walked in.  There was no line as almost everyone does the drive thru.  Got the California Club which was super good.  The prices are reasonable and the staff was nice and quick."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I've passed it so many times and didn't realize it was actually a heathy place to eat especially since it's next to a Mexican fast food stand. My friend got the \"man salad\" and I got the \"California club\". It was nice to be able to get breakfast and lunch at 9:45am. I got the their chocolate, espresso, protein iced drink and it was great! I loved the reggae music. FYI It's a small place and doesn't have public bathrooms and neither does the Mexican place next store so don't go to crazy I the fluids."}
{"text":"After 2 years of living in old town I just went to D'lish last week and I am so sad I didn't find this place sooner! I have now been 3 times in the past 9 days!! The food is amazing. I have only done the drive thru and considering the quality of the food, it was really fast! The iced coffee is amazing on staff recommendations I have had the California Club and the Humanitarian Wrap, & I was very happy with both! Today I had the Tuna Sandwich and can honestly say I've never had a better one!! I am quickly becoming a regular, can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!!"}
{"text":"This place mixes fast drive thru service with quality food. If you want to chill they have a small outdoor patio. Their menu is awesome offering vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Ordered 8 California Clubs for coworkers. All were missing avocado and three were missing egg. Did not look at all like picrure. Little to no flavor."}
{"text":"Great place!! If you are a gym rat this is the place to eat!! Had the AZ Burro and Oatmeal our way. Delicious and awesome !!"}
{"text":"Cute place, minuscule parking lot.  Had a turkey wrap, which was on the small side compared to most wraps I've had, but it was plenty filling enough for me (a little skimpy on the avocado though).  Also tried the breakfast buzz shake, which had pretty good flavor, but was more icy and less creamy than I would have liked."}
{"text":"The staff are extremely friendly and chipper and the food never fails to blow me away. I highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! The kombucha is so good!! Staff was friendly food was yummy.   I'll be back!! I'm vegan so it's hard to find healthy fast food items.   I'm so excited to have a place like this close to my home. I will be a regular for sure.   The only thing I would like to see is more vegan options :)  Or ways to make something vegan below the item on the board."}
{"text":"Kitchen sink salad like I would make myself-mixed greens, carrots, celery, feta, cukes, cous cous, raisins. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a \"sit down\" restaurant for breakfast. While they were friendly, the food comes wrapped in plastic as it is obviously geared to the massive beasts idling next to the patio. With it being 115 degrees,  it's too much for a quiet and peaceful breakfast. To drink hot coffee from a paper lined in plastic cup with car exhaust idling next to your face in the \"too lazy to get out of my car\" drive through window que."}
{"text":"Food was great. The place is very small and anytime, they were turning the blender on, it was a lot of noise inside the restaurant making the atmosphere uncomfortable to sit and have a chat with friends. I figured next, I will only go through drive through."}
{"text":"This small perfectly nestled little place is right up my alley so I loved it before I even ate anything. I like that there is no machine I talk to yet they still have a drive-thru. I like that I actually have to wait for my food to cook and it's not pre wrapped sitting under a heat lamp waiting for me. I like the happy, carefree (in a good way) personality of the staff. I love the food! The mushroom soup is something I crave! The veggie burrito is always piping hot and their salsa that comes with it is perfect! Salads, love! Chicken breast panini, love! I just wish it were across the street from my place instead of my boyfriends. Fresh, trendy, and consistent! Consistency is key and they have nailed it! Thank you D'lish!! Cheers :)"}
{"text":"Easily worthy of 5 stars based on the food alone. However, accessibility & efficiency are not D'Lish's strong points based on a building they've clearly outgrown. Congratulations to creating a successful business, but everybody's favorite neighborhood secret has literally outgrown its charm.   I find it annoying to wait 15 minutes for a blended drink (Breakfast Buzz) which I can easily replicate at home. I could go on and on about the cramped seating, rough chairs & the worst parking lot in S. Scottsdale, but I won't. I want to see D'Lish succeed on a bigger scale. It's quite simple. Rent or build a bigger building. Build your brand; because waiting 25 minutes for breakfast food isn't good business."}
{"text":"Dirty Chai (w/ almond milk) AMAZING. I went out of my way to get this drink!"}
{"text":"Food is good and comes fairly quick, but a little on the pricey side.   Popular place for take out and drive-thru. Eat-in dining area is too small and a little noisy.  Parking can be a nightmare.  Please stay in our neighborhood, but please expand.  Maybe buyout the place next door : )"}
{"text":"First time I came here, I was visiting. After I moved here to AZ, I am still going here! Their quinoa burgers are fantastic. I always get the \"naked burger\" (served on a bed of greens) so I can skip out on those extra carbs.   It is nice they have a drive thru...went through it once and the gentleman at the window was very friendly. Also addressed me by name (gave him my credit card to pay), which always makes someone feel special! Great service and food!"}
{"text":"We just went to D'lish with a friend on a lazy Sunday morning.  I had an egg, cheese, and chicken sausage bialy sandwich.  It had great flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly!  I never drink coffee, but I tried my fiancee's coffee and was very impressed.  The service was great and friendly, and everything came out quick."}
{"text":"So i've been here now 2x and It is for lack of better words Delish!  One of my colleagues told me about this place after bringing back a couple Man Salads for lunch a few times.  I am always looking to try new places and lunch of course is a constant challenge that we are faced with every day...especially whilst working Full-time.  Being in Downtown Scottsdale, you can't not try a new place a minimum  of once a week.  ANYWAYS, I'm a breakfast guy and after a morning work out I felt like trying out their Breakfast Buzz and AZ Burrito.  BOTH were just delightful.  The drive thru has been packed the 2x i've been there and now I know why.  The Breakfast Buzz is just a great protein shake w/ espresso that really gives you the jolt for the day that you need in the office.  The AZ Burrito also was just on point w/ that smoked turkey and egg white.  Neither were overly filling and I was just set for the day.  Usually I get the office some Starbucks to start the Friday off right, but this week there were requests for breakfast buzzes instead.    Quick, D'lish and healthy.  Can't really beat that.  Definitely one of my go-to's for breakfast/lunch.    Cheers"}
{"text":"The AZ Burro was fantastic, as was the Breakfast Club. The coffee was one of the best tasting and the hot tea was great. The music was a bit loud, even outside on the patio but the staff was very friendly and the food tasted \"d'lish\"! Worth the prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I needed a quick place to stop for lunch on our way out of Scottsdale. Stopped here based on Yelp reviews, and it was so wonderful. The food was fresh, delicious and prepared quickly. It also wasn't the kind of place we felt awkward having a baby with us. Very casual and friendly.  We also got iced chai lattes for the drive home to Tucson, and they were great! I haven't been anywhere that offers almond milk as a dairy milk substitute, so that was a very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"They have cheap small plastic cups for water. I requested a bigger cup for water and the response was that we have to charge you. That is okay for fast food but not okay for my $9 lunch."}
{"text":"Great menu and atmosphere. Service wasn't the best, but the manager handled the situation very well and professionally. Unfortunately I found a dead fly tucked into the paper on my wrap. We may have had a fluke bad experience, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here to check out what all the \"buzz\" was about, and ordered the breakfast buzz.  Wow what a great shake.  The service was super friendly and there croissant sandwich was phenomenal.  Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service.  The breakfast buzz was amazing.  Super healthy and the place looks fantastic.  Would definitely go back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to grab a quick breakfast. Ingredients are fresh, menu is unique, prices are reasonable, the guy behind the counter was friendly, and the Breakfast Buzz is AMAZING. I can't wait to go back for lunch to try the 'Man' Salad."}
{"text":"I go to D'lite quite often since I work near there. They are always very friendly and quick with their orders. The food is tasty and consistent. The reason for a four star and not a five is because I would love for more vegan options. Other than that... I love it :)"}
{"text":"Great place that takes quick service and gives it a nice healthy twist. It can be very difficult to find a healthy meal and quick service. This place has a great menu especially if you consider yourself somewhat health conscious. My only complaint is that I wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"Lord have mercy, their black bean & quinoa burger (made early bird style) is my JAM. I appreciate the drive-thru for a small restaurant like this (even though it usually takes about 10-15 minutes to get through during lunch). I don't know how many calories might be in this thing because it's got plenty of spicy mayo and cheese but... I JUST DON'T CARE. So good!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite lunch spot. I have two kids and if my youngest is asleep and we are out and about I'll go through the drive-thru , grab my food & kombucha and be on my way. The staff is always super friendly! To the people complaining about the line : yes , it's long and can be annoying when people \"cut in front of you\" but truly there isn't anything more the staff can do. Don't get your panties in a twist. Relax!   I highly suggest the Humanitarian + veg supreme (pesto and avocado) ... As a vegetarian I love the flavor of the wrap and never find myself wanting more."}
{"text":"Wow had their California breakfast sandwich..so yummy. Went thru the drive thru and they had friendly service. :)"}
{"text":"This speakeasy was kickass. The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great. The drive thru is an awesome touch. I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good. We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter. It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited. I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!"}
{"text":"A cute, friendly little place on a busy road but well worth finding! We stopped by for brunch on our first visit to Scottsdale. Had the frittata...so good it hit the spot. Our kids ate the California club and couldn't finish them so I'll order 1 dish to share the next time. As previously mentioned some may find it a bit pricy but did not disappoint! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This D'lish location just recently opened close to my place.  Absolutely love the atmosphere, workers, and food. Large four berry smoothie = awesome hangover recovery Chicken breast panini is my go-to sandwich.  BOMB.  This place is so green that I feel guilty driving my car there..So I walk and get to feel extra good about the environment.  Only downside is the fact that they close at 4PM...  (Maybe it would be wise to readjust the hours when ASU is in session.  50,000 students are nearby looking for healthy options for food at all hours.) ;)"}
{"text":"Just found D'lish through a friend's recommendation.  Portabello soup and turkey club are amazing, coffee (their own) is smooth, and the service is friendly and fast.  It really doesn't get any better than this!!!  I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Seriously great food and wonderful staff!  My favorites are the Veggie bowl and Chicken panini.  Breakfasts are great too.  Drive-through is fast."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Been eating here for 4 years now and I crave it regularly. I always order the same thing now because I know what I love: The humanitarian wrap with a portobello soup and the orange glorious. Their hummus plate is fantastic though! Really satisfying for a light lunch or snack."}
{"text":"Great food, drive through, iced coffee was delicious and the staff was super friendly. Loved this place and would come back if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Quick stop sandwich spot. The California club was perfect for brunch"}
{"text":"I give their Dirty Chai with Almond Milk 5 Stars.  Their protein burger, however gets 2 Stars. It wasn't dry like some veggie burgers can be but it was tasteless. I got the Early Bird (open faced, no bun) and the Chipotle Aioli was so overwhelming that you couldn't really taste anything else. The egg on top of the burger was also very bland.  The service was OK, a little slow  I'll have to come back to try a different meal.  ."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The restaurant is all about being organic and earth friendly, however they do not use cage-free eggs. ( So, not so earth friendly) Cage free does not mean the hens are treated well, but it is better! So my only suggestion would be to use cage-free eggs!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! They are under staffed though... so when it's busy the drive thru gets backed up and can take up to 30 mins to get food. One of my favorite my favorite places."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this spot! Great food options but my favorite item is the Breakfast Buzz! It's a blended iced drink with espresso, protein powder, peanut butter, banana and several other ingredients. It's basically like a meal replacement shake and tastes amazing. I'm addicted now! Great coffee shop/lunch atmosphere and very very friendly service. There's a drink thru window available as well."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, five stars. It is all really tasty, especially the breakfast sandwiches!  I'm subtracting stars because I'm confused about their mission statement and overall concept. Their website states \"we offer organic and all natural fresh ingredients, including locally grown produce when available.\" I noticed on my most recent trip through D'lish's drive thru a notorious and easily recognizable jar of peanut butter with a blue/turquoise lid aka Skippy brand peanut butter. Of all the peanut butters on the market, this is one of the least health conscious products out there! Not only does it contain genetically modified/engineered oils but they are hydrogenated. In layman's terms, it contains TRANS FATS. This type of fat raises your bad cholesterol, lowers your good cholesterol, and puts you at a higher risk for having a stroke, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Peanut butter without trans fats and genetically engineered ingredients is readily available and such a choice should be obvious for a restaurant that considers themselves \"healthy\".  I can't trust any of their other ingredients when they go the cheapo route on something so basic."}
{"text":"I was led here by yelp reviews. When I came here, there was no one and I thought I had made a mistake. I walked in and there was a tall guy at the register which was extremely friendly. My friend and I ordered and when our food came out, I understood why this place is so popular. The sandwich was so warm, perfect, soft, and just amazing overall. I ordered the cali club and my friend ordered the turkey sandwich. Both were great!   And then as we were leaving, there was about 9 cars lined up at the drive-thru. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great alternative to Starbucks to grab a coffee in the morning because they open at 6am and because the staff is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable. The food is awesome. I had an egg, cheese, potato, and bacon burrito with the house blend coffee. Delicious! Really cool that they have a drive-through window, as well. You gotta go here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the egg, potato, and cheese burrito at the new Arcadia location and would not order this again.  They put in fried hash browns in the burrito!  Not very healthy!  Sorry to say, \"I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is great, I had the chicken breast Pannani and wife had the Southwestern bowl. The business is in a too small building however and if dining inside the blender noises are too loud for talking and if sitting outside there is no umbrellas from the sun. No bathrooms in premises, you have to walk to a nearby bar.   But if you are OK with that stuff, the prices are good and food fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I was one of the many people who hopped on the delish bandwagon when they hit the south scottsdale scene. What a great concept. Healthy fast food. Not only has the quality of their food gone down but also their ability to hire individuals to provide any form of customer service. Today I called in an order and like many other times I get a girl who answers the phone like she would chatting with a friend, zero phone etiquette and the vocabulary of a child. In addition to the drop in service and the quality of food, the owners still have invested no money into the dump of a building this place is in. I'm surprised it passes the health code inspections. There is no bathroom for guests to use and it seems as if they are in no hurry at all to have these issues addressed."}
{"text":"so glad we visited this little shop - it was amazing to the extent we went there for breakfast and lunch and if they served dinner would have been there for dinner too!"}
{"text":"This place made me believe in Arizona food again. It's easy to think of AZ as a bland cookie cutter city but places like D'lish are helping us gain a culinary identity. Go D'lish!"}
{"text":"I went to the location on Shea (I was unable to find the location on yelp)  The service was fantastic, the employees (not just one but all) were helpful, informative and kind.  Any questions or menu modifications were gladly answered and accepted.      We had a sample of the \"morning buzz\" it was amazing and my husband ordered one for him self. I had the California club and beet salad both satisfying and delicious.   On my way out the door an employees noticed I was leaving with my iced tea half full they offered to refill my iced tea which I gladly accepted.    Give this place a try I'm sure you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The person who took my order at the drive thru was not friendly at all. My kitchen sink salad did not have several of the ingredients that were listed and it was very small. The chicken was not good and there were very few pieces. Also the bagel \"chips\" were just slices of bagel, nothing chippy about them at all. Not sure I'll ever go back after my first experience being not so good. I'll stick with Protein House right around the corner. I've never had a bad meal there thus far."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Fast, delicious, fresh food!  We were in town last week from Chicago and based on the yelp reviews checked this place out.  I had a yummy hummos plate and my husband the turkey sandwich.  Returned 2 days later for more.  Good prices, friendly service, and great food!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, it's been a nightmare being vegan and ordering from this place. Never have I been through the drive-thru and have received a correct order. Yes, I understand ordering vegan is a bit more complicated but at a place like this, one would think that the *entire* staff should be competent enough to be able to handle such a feat.  After speaking with a manager regarding my last order and telling them I did not want a free meal, that I just wanted my money back and it was the principle and the concept of when a food establishment gets an order wrong, it creates waste. I was surprised to hear their reply: that they don't care what I do with the food. Be that as it may, they should care because that means they're losing money. So, after I stated I just wanted my money back, the manager seemed to have become short and frustrated. This last visit just further solidified my validation in that this place is NOT for vegans."}
{"text":"I love this place not because the food is great, fresh, and healthy. Not because its got a great neighborhood feel to it, but because its full of deadly handsome bearded men that work there."}
{"text":"Food was healthy and tasty but a bit overpriced and akward to wait if you order to-go.  They have absolutely no waiting area or chairs so I was standing in the middle of two rows of tightly packed tables trying not to be in the way.  And they told me 10 min wait over the phone but I'm pretty sure I waited at least 30 mins.  :("}
{"text":"I have gone to this location at least 3 times and the Scottsdale location at least 5 times. This location is much safer to pull into and out of. In my experience of the other location a trip to get a healthy breakfast sandwich can feel like a suicide mission.. This  location has a lot more parking.  It is an extra bonus that the employees seem to enjoy their job! Since this location feels much safer and over all a more enjoyable experience I have started to drive out of my way to go to this location. The food is amazing at both location!"}
{"text":"I always love dlish, I know I can't go wrong - anything on the menu is fantastic and fresh. I typically get a breakfast buzz and a sand which depending on how hungry I am. Great food!"}
{"text":"Best thing about this little hole in the wall place is the food.  Those of you driving on Scottsdale Road would most likely miss the location of this restaurant if you're not looking carefully.  So keep an eye out!  My favs are the frittatas and salads.  Yummy and definitely tastes healthy for you.  Plus, the staff are very friendly.  The bonus:  free doggie treats for your canine companion.  Only thing....it's loud in the restaurant area because of all the blenders and barista sounds.  It's kind of challenging to carry on a conversation.  I recommend the outdoor patio seating when the weather's cool.    And...the drive through is not really a typical drive through experience.  Expect to wait approximately 10 minutes for your order while you're waiting in your vehicle (because of course, they are making your meal from scratch).  It may be faster to just park and order take out inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. The food is always awesome, love the buzz, the staff is always hilarious. They can blare all kinds of reggae music, hell even country ( and I hate country quite a bit) and I'd still be there pretty much everyday. I do wish that they would be open later  so after work I could get dinner lol."}
{"text":"Just had a meeting here and it was great. Nice big cup of tea and a great environment. Too early for food but I'll definitely be back to try it out!"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick snack not during peak hours (10am). I ordered the Oatmeal to go. The place wasn't that busy at all. But it took 20 minutes for just the oatmeal to come out. When it finally did, the milk was cold and the fruits in it was not fresh at all. This was my third time coming here, each time the experience gets worse. Not a fan."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had spent the previous four days hiking around Arizona and we were looking for something fast, healthy, and relatively inexpensive.  We found all three in D'Lite!  She loved her California Club and I devoured my black bean and quinoa burger.  My girlfriend wishes we had a place like this back in Cleveland as she would certainly be a regular.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the decor inside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"NOM. NOMNOM. Let me eat this delicious fuhd forever and always!  Specifically, let me eat the quinoa burger all day err day. There's something about the cool cucumber sauce or the tangy pesto or the gooey melty sticky cheese and thick juicy tomato and can you see me drooling through your computer screen yet?   I am a vegetarian. Yes. So, the options at this lovely little restaurant fit my moral standards and they did so deliciously. On top of that, the staff is so friendly. They hand out free smoothie samples regularly, all of which are quite scrumptious. I will never turn down a free smoothie sample. Ever.   The only bummer was that at around one in the afternoon one lunch date awhile ago they had ran out of kombucha to pair with my quinoa burger. That was probably the only time that unfortunate drought had happened to me, though. It was quickly forgotten after a free smoothie sample was placed in my palm. Thirst: quenched. Stomach: filled. Wallet: thick. Stars: five.   Eat at D'lish, just don't drink all of my kombucha."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Cool little place with very cool vibe and food. Wish they had one on the north west side of town. Will be back as I pass this way from time to time. Oh, and the iced tea was amazing as well."}
{"text":"d'lish is for sure the perfect name for this little place. When you walk in, the atmosphere is great, what with the snazzy furniture, friendly staff, and the plenty of customers in line, eager for the fresh food they serve up. Their menu is expansive and you might feel overwhelmed by all the breakfasts, soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, are you feeling overwhelmed as I talk about all the choices that will overwhelm you?! Last time I went there, I ordered the nuts n' berries salad, the perfect toss of greens, blueberries, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. It's perfect! I've also had their butternut squash soup, YUM! I try to try something different all the places I eat, and at D'lish, it'll be a while till I run out of new options. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Grabbing a breakfast buzz and a sandwich before work! Fantastic pick me up and a great way to start the day! Best healthy food in the valley by far and one of my all time favorite spots in the valley!"}
{"text":"First time to D'lish and I must say I am impressed.  The drive-thru may have a line, but they do their best to get people through as fast as possible.  I had the Veggie Burrito.  It's probably the best I have ever had...delicious Portabella mushrooms and perfect egg whites and potatoes.  The salsa is great, the people are friendly....I will definitely eat there again (and again)."}
{"text":"California club : bomb. Turkey club : good. Regular side salad : okay. Protein burger early bird style : eh...too spicy but probably to hide the fact that the quinoa black bean party is extremely bland and dry. Green tea and breakfast buzz were delicious too. Quaint spot, very small, has a drive through but you should dine in or you'll be in line forever. People are saying it's one dollar sign but I think it's on the expensive side...maybe for the type of food it might be one dollar...or considering it's Scottsdale it's pretty cheap lol."}
{"text":"D'lish is my favorite morning breakfast spot! The California and breakfast club are awesome. They also have a really good protein shake to make the morning count!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location very regularly as i love the healthy option on the go. Food is great, smoothies are awesome, people are nice enough, but the drive thru is 1 star speed. Even for a small smoothie and being the lone car in the drive thru, on average, takes 10-15 minutes. Longest wait has been up to 20 minutes with only a couple cars in line. I don't know if it's a lack or urgency with the employees or a lack of staffing, but it hasn't gotten better in about a year and possibly getting worse it feels lately."}
{"text":"I love coming to D'lite, I know the food is always freshly made. I highly recommend trying the 'man' salad if you have never ordered their food it's one of my favorites as well as the turkey club **but as a wrap instead of sandwich! It's a little disappointing they close at 4 pm. Oh, and just a heads up, the parking lot and drive through can be a little overwhelming because it is a very tiny location but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by before a baseball game--- very busy parking lot and drive thru. Decided to park and try our luck inside...and we got our sandwiches pretty fast. Tried the tomato turkey wrap and the chicken panini. Both were very delicious... Full of fresh ingredients and tastiness. Perfect for a healthy lunch. Also, the service was friendly even though it was crazy busy."}
{"text":"Clean, healthy, vegan, vegetarian with high quality meat and dairy selections. Breakfast croissant was out of this world. All the items I have purchased, so far, have intense and delicious flavor, and are amazingly tasty for being so healthy. WOW. Love this place."}
{"text":"The coffee was similar in quality to Starbucks and a better value."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon D'lish whilst looking for a different breakfast alternative and was very happy with the discovery.  Food is top notch, creative, and right in the range of what you should expect for good quality breakfast food.  Thumbs up on the service.  Biggest knocks against the place is the ambiance.  Overly loud, somewhat unpleasant club music not conducive to a sunday morning breakfast that did nothing to conceal the very loud shake/ice grinding machine.    Definitely check the place out but after ordering find a table outside."}
{"text":"I am here every week, sometimes multiple times, and a Breakfast Buzz is where it's at! That is my go-to order, and the chocolate-espresso-banana-peanut butter-protein shake is a little taste of heaven. They have punch cards for drinks, and the staff is AMAZING. They know me by name and always take a minute to ask how I am. I love this place so much I'm going to make them Christmas cookies."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast shake and egg white sandwich. Healthy, fast and delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They now have a baby buzz (16 oz) and a thug buzz (24 oz) It's great they have more options!     The oatmeal our way with almond milk is a perfect nourishing breakfast.  You can get their breakfast burrito enchilada style. It's a large burrito so you could definitely split between two.  The California Club is always fresh and a must try if you like avocado."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while getting some gas and I  have to tell you that I couldn't have been happier. This place has top notch everything. Super tasty sandwiches! Will definitely be coming back. Great quality and a really cute set up. I got the California breakfast sandwich and it was to die for."}
{"text":"The signature tuna sandwich served hot is the best tuna I've ever had. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the prices are very reasonable for such delicious food."}
{"text":"I travel 30+ weeks a year; hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've had in years! Coffee pretty darn good too. Try 'me out fer sure"}
{"text":"What can I say...the best healthy fast food in the world. A few of my favorites are the veggie burrito, green lemonade, & the vegan breakfast buzz. I'm addicted & my experiences have been seamlessly amazing! I miss decly though!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place for quality, whole/healthy breakfast and lunch.  Love their healthy, all-natural protein shakes and fruit/veggie smoothies, too."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a D'Lite and I thought my breakfast was delicious. I ordered the Low Carb Breakfast and a large iced coffee with almond milk. My meal came out quick. I think I waited at the most 10 minutes. I like a lot of almond milk in my coffee so after taking a few sips to make room I asked for a top off of almond milk and the lady kindly obliged. Another employee came over to clean off the dirty napkins and straw wrappers on our table. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly staff and great healthy d'elicious food. Was looking for a breakfast spot perfect for brunch on the weekend"}
{"text":"Love this place.  No seriously, LOVE!  California club breakfast sandwich = the best thing I've put in my mouth first thing in the morning in a long time.  The house style frittata is unbelievably amazing as well.  Package it all in a cute, small, quaint, local establishment with a drive thru as well and it's a score."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the california club and breakfast wrap!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Best ice tea & iced coffee! If you've never been to D'lish you have got to try it or your really missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I love the food, and it's always super fast and convenient. Rating it a 4/5 because the choices of condiments is super slim pickings (no ketchup) , and the menu isn't always customizable.  Also, they don't split checks through the drive trough. I find this odd"}
{"text":"3 Star! Friendly staff, fast service, we both got the California club. They were good but totally overpriced. $8+ taxes for each. It was good enough, but on the smaller side, never something I'd crave, or pay that much for a breakfast sandwich again. The pictures make it look extremely delicious, and it was just.. good? Not fantastic for the price though  I'm also not a huge fan of the process through the drive thru. They run your card and you sign for it, but like at a restaurant, they have a spot for a tip. I don't tip for Taco Bell, why is this different lol?  It's the exact same process as any other drive thru.. no special treatment. Taco Bell employees don't accept tips. The one who was handling check out (sweet young girl) was also hovering over us as he filled it out which makes us feel obligated to then tip on top of the overpriced breakfast sandwich.. meh. If I want to throw a couple dollars in cash, great! Don't like feeling obligated when speaking 3 words total to someone. It's a drive thru, not a full service restaurant.. sorry"}
{"text":"I love this concept:  healthy breakfast/brunch/lunch on-the-go.  I tried D'lish this morning for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't expecting much from a drive-through establishment but they delivered a hot, yummy breakfast, coupled with a chai latte that was probably the best I've had to date!  Don't go expecting the speed of fast food drive-through.  You will wait a bit but it's worth it because the food is that much better.  I tried the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage, wrapped in a warm whole wheat tortilla.  I enjoyed it.  What makes me happy is that there are several other breakfast and lunch items that look appealing to me so I know a repeat visit is in my future."}
{"text":"Amazing, tasty, healthy, filling food. My husband and I came here routinely for weekend brunch. His favorite was the California club, mine was the early bird protein burger (black bean and quinoa). Parking can be a pain, seating can be limited, and their tiny restroom is accessible outside on the backside of their kitchen... Kinda like a gas station. All that being said, totally worth it."}
{"text":"I read some reviews that complained about how long they waited for their food. I always call in my order. They're friendly servers have it ready when I get there. The Tuna sandwich is very good."}
{"text":"I will travel across town to get decent food which is almost impossible to find. This D'Lish opened up right near our home and I ignored it for months until my wife tried it and told me it was good. Well, one day I tried it and I have been eating there nearly every day since. I emailed all my friends about it and emailed the owner to tell them how great their food was and how lucky we were that it opened up right down the street from our house. I have had their tuna sandwich 4 days in a row. It is by far and hands won the best tuna sandwich in the universe! You have not had a tuna sandwich until you get one from D'Lish!  Everything that I have tried from the menu has been excellent.   One reviewer wrote \"I probably eat here once a week. It is my dream to one day try everything on the menu. Unfortunately, I can't stop eating that damn tuna sandwich\"  I did the exact same thing. When I first went in  I said that I would go right down the menu and try everything. But that tuna sandwich is heaven and I can't' resist it every time I go there."}
{"text":"So this is the 2nd time I've been here. It's fast-causal, a little more pricey than Chipotle, but overall worth it if you want a clean, light, and filling meal.   The first time I ordered, I got the hummus plate: raw vegetables, hummus, and a delicious pita bread. The hummus' flavor was toned down (bland if you're a Debbie downer lol) than other hummus I've had but it was still good. What throws me off is a broccoli+hummus combo. That's probably a thing, but you'd think they'd serve blanched broccoli and not raw. Maybe I'm wrong. Idunno.  The second time was better. Veggie bowl, mostly consisting of quinoa, with a little bit of tomatoes and mushrooms. Flip-Flopping delicious. I'd eat it over and over again. Yet, again, raw broccoli... As a dominant veggie. lolwat.   Now, I do like raw broccoli but I eat that plant by itself or with ranch/blue cheese dressing. Everything else, I'd eat it cooked. Tell me I'm picky, tell me that I'm raw broccoli hater, tell me I'm weird. Just don't tell me you'd have raw broccoli in your cooked quinoa because Ima tell you you're weird too."}
{"text":"Solid food. Friendly staff which is a plus. Most frequent visitors know that parking is a major struggle as well as the drive thru line. I live near by and often there is a line flowing out into Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"I first learned of this 'hole in the wall' fabulous gem when I was taken by the hand there by a former love last winter.  I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago and I am still in love with the YUMMY YUM YUM YUM food and smoothies they whip up.    While dining there they make me feel like a Goddess and will act as your 'date' if you go in solo or with another girlfriend.  It doesn't hurt to have amazing company and laughter while you dive into your California Club and inhale your Breakfast Buzz!  The oatmeal is something amazing and everything is simply tasty!  The price is nice and is someplace I would take the snobbiest \"Scottsdalelight\" for a pleasant surprise and an amazing meal.  The portions are sharable if you are watching your wallet or waistline!"}
{"text":"My newest addiction here is the oatmeal. It is made with quinoa, which sounds a little odd. Don't knock it until you try it, you won't regret it! Have I mentioned how awesome the staff here is too?! This is my favorite places to go when I first wake up. A day that starts at D'lish is guaranteed to be a perfect one."}
{"text":"Excellent food. California club can be eaten for breakfast or lunch!  Drive thru line can be long, but there is about 8 small tables inside."}
{"text":"The only thing that isn't awesome about this place is the parking lot...when there are folks in the drive-thru, there usually no way to get around that line of cars to park, so you just wait.  Oh, and the interior seat cushions are a bit worn (being nitpicky now).  The food is delish (or d'lish, I suppose?), healthy, and somewhat creative.  Definitely NOT your typical drive-thru fair.  I've tried a few different things (wraps, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches) and I always keep coming back to the California Club (no bacon please!) for breakfast and lunch.  It's impressive they are able to offer many organic and.or local ingredients for similar pricing to say, Subway.  Depending on who is at the checkout, the service isn't always with a smile, but at least it's pretty quick.  And for a sandwich this good, I'm totally fine with that!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place in my mind. Def hipster and casual dining. Great stop after a workout. It combines heathy eats with a \"fast food\" concept. I love that I can make healthy eating choices on the go by using their drive-thru! I will say that their drive through is typically slammed to the point where no one can pull in to wait in line or park to go inside. Parking is also very limited and poorly designated so much so that there have been many times I have parked to run in to get food and when I came back out I've had to wait 5-10minutes just to get out of the parking lot. Obviously, the food here is AMAZING and well priced otherwise I would never waste my time going here but I had to give it only 3 stars because it can be VERY time consuming depending on when you choose to go. They have very limited seating both inside and outside. They are known for their \"Breakfast Buzz\" which is a protein shake and happens to be what I order every time I visit. They also offer a \"Vegan\" option when making this shake that is also D'lish! They have a good selections of healthy food options, the service is quick once you have placed your order and the staff is SUPER friendly and deserve an A+!    If you are looking for a healthy menu and you are NOT in a rush then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but nuked to crazy hot temps. Props for the non-disposable plates if you eat there. Minus for the parking lot that's impossible to get out of if there's a line in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"The breakfast club sandwich here was great and then to top it off their house shake with chocolate, peanut butter, and espresso was addictive!"}
{"text":"I love this place, always good food, good service and did I mention the good food...  They recently raised their prices and were courteous enough to post a letter on the door. They are worth every penny"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better customer service. Line is always long and it's obvious why. You get quality food that's unique and service that is personable. Can't get enough"}
{"text":"I love this place, we eat here at least twice a week and it's always great!  The service is always friendly and attentive, the food is always delicious and they have the best Iced green tea in town."}
{"text":"I love the new D'lish restaurant in Tempe.  I've been to the Scottsdale location before and was pleasantly surprised by the new location.  It is larger, more open and very well-designed.  I had an iced green tea and the 'man' salad, which was a tuna stuffed avocado on top of a salad already loaded with chicken, bacon, feta and a side of cucumber blue cheese dressing.  I must say, this salad is both amazing and very filling. There were some familiar faces from the Scottsdale location working and everyone was very upbeat and friendly.  If you're in the ASU area, I would definitely recommend checking it out for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I've only had the breakfast buzz here but it's all I need. I seriously replaced my usual Starbucks or Dutch Bros run for this. Espresso doesn't do anything for me, but at least this isn't empty sugar and calories."}
{"text":"Great food! Great friendly service! I love fresh healthy choices... This establishment would do well in the good parts of LA and I for one, would like a piece of the action!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love this place, it gives you the local business vibe, along with healthy eating options. The drive thru is the biggest seller for me.  I love the breakfast buzz nothing starts my day of better than espresso in my protein shake."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Convenient and good ingredients. Not trashy fast food but guilt free healthy and prompt!"}
{"text":"The Breakfast Buzz.....THE Breakfast buzz. Oh my goodness I think this place could get 5 stars just for this amazing morning \"smoothie\" drink. It tastes like heaven on earth, I'm not exaggerating. Also had one of their California breakfast clubs and it was d'lish as well! I plan on moving to the area soon and I already know this will be one of my go-to breakfast destinations! They also highlight their use of local and organic ingredients whenever possible AND they have a drive-through. We need more places like D'lish across the nation..or at least 10 more locations in the Phoenix metro area to start!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Just moved to this part of town recently and am now frequenting this place whenever I can (since they close at 4pm).  The fact that I can get amazing, fresh, natural, often organic and local food, in a drive thru is awesome.  This place is very small but it doesn't matter because it's all good and usually pretty quick (considering what you get).  I even ordered soup when it was 105 degrees just because i wanted to try everything!  And I don't mind paying extra cuz it's always fresh, delicious and they're friendly (and cute) so why not.  You probably drive by it all the time and don't even notice it, but you're missing out.  Can't wait to try their dinner entrees (even though they close at 4pm) they also have a lot of breakfast stuff and smoothies and coffees too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Dirty Chai and Kitchen Sink salad are both a must!"}
{"text":"More expensive than I would like.   I have been here twice now, both times choosing their Breakfast Buzz protein shake with an extra scoop of protein powder. It's a good post-workout treat. It also is about $1.50 more than the sweet price-point where I'd show up multiple times a week to buy one.   Nice staff, they all seem positive and quick."}
{"text":"If I visit Tempe again and need to grab a quick and healthy bite to eat, I will def swing by D'lish again. This cute little local eatery reminds me of what I can find in Austin. I ordered the turkey club, and it was stuffed with healthy and fresh ingredients. The place is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to their restaurants since they opened and were called delish excellent Food Service and employees are great."}
{"text":"I was visiting from San Diego and really enjoyed this place! I ordered the turkey club and it was superb"}
{"text":"Love this place, fast but healthy. Not much catering towards keto/Whole 30... there's lots of grain offered. But they can be quite accommodating. Biggest drawback- patio sitting. You can listen to Shea or obnoxious hiphop at McFates next door. And...it smells like gas oven farts inside.  But the food, the service; A++!!"}
{"text":"Pretty quick and good.  Tried D'lish for breakfast and was impressed.  Nice service and good menu."}
{"text":"I recommend the California Breakfast Club and d'buzz shake!  took my mom and sister here who are both picky and they both loved it as well! Quick, clean, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great environment. Very excited about having a healthy and reasonably priced \"fast food\" restaurant on this side of town"}
{"text":"YUM! This place is a little gem I stumbled upon not too long ago. Their name says it all. I could say more, but there's no need. If you're near by, check it out. If not, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Are you serious? !! First time here visiting from Cali and they don't have ketchup?? -___- disappointed"}
{"text":"Get this delicious food to go u less you enjoy eating a deliciously delicate breakfast sandwich amidst a cacophony of whirls, beats and operational mechanics."}
{"text":"Nice little place for lunch or breakfast. But no restrooms? Really?  How are you supposed to wash your hands?"}
{"text":"My first thought when I came here was, I hope the food is worth the wait. And It was.  My fellow yelpers never do me wrong, so I had to go with the California Club and Breakfast Buzz.  Both lived up to the numerous good reviews.  I just loved the Breakfast Buzz's hint of peanut butter flavor. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food considering they have a drive through.  This place is most definitely not your typical fast food restaurant.  If you have not come here yet, give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews but I had to because the food was so yummy. Last minute decision to try this new place and it's my go to place for breakfast now. I love that it's a drive thru especially when you have a toddler. The food was fresh and delicious! I ordered the California signature breakfast sandwich  and it was amazing! I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place was busy on a Monday morning. The dine-in experience was clean and prompt. Only complaint is the noise of the coffee grinders made conversation hard.  The food and drink was very good. Fresh and hip. Good options for alternative diets. I have both a vegan and a paleo eater in the family who would be happy with the options.  Drive thru looked very slow, but inside was great!"}
{"text":"The vegan buzz is so good, breakfast and coffee all in one. It is a bit too sweet to have often and expensive, but it's great in a pinch. Everyone is friendly and while the wait is long they seem to be working hard."}
{"text":"Everytime I pull up to D'Lish I seriously have cartoon hearts popping out of my chest.  I have loved every single thing I've eaten here. Breakfast go to is a Frittata - perfectly done. Split a hummus if you're grabbing lunch with friends. My new favorite dish is the Southwest Bowl - Basmati Rice and Enchilada Sauce together as one? Yes, Please! The staff here is phenomenal..always feel welcome! I prefer to call ahead and you're in and out in a flash."}
{"text":"This place is extremely convient and comfortable. I love that they have vegan options that are extremely delishious.  A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"The California Club was bomb. We went through the drive through, and although there was a line several cars long we only waited 10 minutes. The four berry smoothie was also \"d'lish.\""}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. When on Scottsdale road, be vigilant you could drive by without noticing it... Very friendly service. Healthy, tasty food. I ordered the low carb breakfast. It was excellent. At 9am the walk-in customers are in majority people who have just finished their morning sport. Lively music competes with the noise of the blenders. Judging by the length of the line of cars in the drive thru (that never decreased while I was eating), they are very popular. Good dynamic breakfast atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast burrito and a hot coffee and both were quite tasty.. Decent prices and they are pretty fast.   The inside is small, but they do have outdoor seating.  If I am ever passing by again, I will definitely stop there again."}
{"text":"Yummy!  And great service.  Had lunch with my parents who had to sit and wait for us. But the staff took great care of them. And when we showed up they took great care of us too. We all has the California Club.  It's obvious why it's the most ordered item. It's terrific. They made mine gluten free by putting it in a bowl on top of a potato cake. D'Lish!!  That's your first tip. - if you're GF, try it that way.    Your second tip has two parts: it's a drive thru so drive through!  They're really fast and organized. You won't wait long. But if you feel like sitting down keep in mind there's not a lot of seating so don't hit them at the prime time. Go 15 minutes before or after noon, for example.   But go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Dlish, it is one of my favorite healthy spots to eat. So grateful to have healthy and delicious restaurants like this, with also super amazing and friendly staff. Thanks Dlish, and keep up the amazing work!!!"}
{"text":"The drive through was super busy, yet they got in my order quick and the food came out great. I had the breakfast buzz and the Cali club always fantastic. My date ordered the nuts and berries salad after she got in her low brow jokes about nuts and berries she looked at me smiling and said this is all she ever wanted."}
{"text":"Love this place! The breakfast buzz drinks are the most amazing coffee/protein drink. Even have the buzz drink for vegans(no dairy). Food is a little pricey but sooooo worth it! Wish they had one in Ahwatukee"}
{"text":"The oatmeal was unique and very good. I also thought the Breakfast Buzz was great.  It is a cool experience that is well worth the trip.  I get so tired of the same old food choices and this is just different.  I like different and am glad I stumbled across D'lish."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location and the service was stellar!!! They had plenty of staff and each and every employee was extremely accommodating. They came by our table several times to check on us. Great place to go for good food if you want to feel like your patronage is appreciated! Be prepared to feel great from the moment you walk through the door to the time you leave. :)))"}
{"text":"D'lish would be a perfect start to any type of day, whether it's action-filled days of snowboarding, inaction-filled days of laying by a pool and reading... or even, for the approx 90% of working-aged Americans who are sauntering, driving, running, biking, whatnot off to work.   My New Year's Eve day was perfectly (obsessively) planned, and I wanted to make the most of it. So it was with slight trepidation that I decided on D'lish to start out my day. And... it was perfect!  Perfectly hot/warm burritos filled with perfectly fluffy eggs and potatoes and savory meat to fill me perfectly full, at a price point that did not mar the perfection.  5 yums up!"}
{"text":"I am all about healthy food and this place is so convenient for a guilt free bite! The pesto chicken wrap is my favorite.. I have yet to try the breakfast but the menu looks delish."}
{"text":"D'lish is a GREAT breakfast and lunch spot in Tempe. Thus far I have had the Turkey Club and Kitchen Sink salad. All ingredients are fresh, healthy, and made to order, and I've been very happy with my meals! And what would a coffee shop be without great coffee? NOM. Very delicious coffee. I like that there is inside seating, a patio, and a drive thru. My classes are at the law school in Tempe and I can zip over there in between classes to grab a bite. Not to mention that the staff is SUPER and super nice. Very happy that D'lish opened a tempe location!"}
{"text":"Great find for healthy fast food. Tried the croissant sandwich and a good cup of joe."}
{"text":"Love this place for fast and delicious healthy food. My favorite is the early bird burger. The tuna is really good and so is d'veggie bowl. Any breakfast option is solid. Staff is always super friendly :)"}
{"text":"D'lish's California Club is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten PERIOD! They usually put it on focaccia bread, but I think it's much better on sourdough (grilled, of course!). It's just the most exquisite combination of lightly fried eggs, smoked bacon, fresh avocado, tomato, sweet cream and pesto that will send you to heaven! WORTH the wait! Their coffee is very satisfying and the staff couldn't be friendlier. Truly one of Arizona's food gems."}
{"text":"Stopped by D'Lite the other day, as I heard they had a drive thru and I wanted a post-workout smoothie. I pulled up to the drive thru menu and saw just a handful of smoothie options. I open for the berry one, and asked if I could have it made with protein. I asked her which one she recommended for my berry smoothie, and went with her choice. I ended up paying about $6 for a small smoothie that was not blended well. The protein powder was overwhelming, and had I realized it wasn't going to blend well it would have been nice if either it was properly blended or the woman working there had made a better suggestion. I drank 2 sips and ended up throwing it away. Bummer!"}
{"text":"cali club and a buzz = pure bliss any time of day. just wish they were open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think much of D'lish from its unassuming exterior.  It almost looks like a fast food or burger joint from the outside.  Upon closer inspection, however, it is a brightly lit, quaint restaurant both inside and out.  And although D'lish isn't a full service restaurant, the staff is helpful and adds to the cheery feel of the establishment.  The food, simply put, is d'lish.  It is simple and healthy.  I just had the Traditional Breakfast Burrito.  Even though there is nothing complex about the ingredients, it is great.  The eggs are nice and fluffy, and the potatoes are just slightly crispy, just the way I like them.  The only thing is that it can get just a little dry since so much egg is packed into there, so some salsa definitely helps.  I also had the Breakfast Buzz Shake, which was quite good as well.  It's infused with so much stuff that it's hard to describe.  \"Rich\" would be one word to call it.  It is a bit pricey, but with all the vitamins, protein, and other stuff they put in it, I suppose it is worth it, making a good start to a hot day.  Overall, I am quite happy with my experience at D'lish.  I love the idea of fast but healthy.  It's a great place to pick up breakfast before heading off to, oh I don't know, the Grand Canyon maybe."}
{"text":"Yeah I was addictd to the breakfast buzz for a month straight , actually still getting 2-3 a week. The California club is good, the man salad with tuna is a favorite.    5 star !"}
{"text":"I love D'lish- my favorite things are the breakfast buzz and the breakfast quinoa. My only complaint is the drive thru at this location. It's enough to make me need to call in an emergency bottle of Xanax. It's super narrow and people are always trying to squeeze through. Maybe I'm a hyper freak but it was terrifying. This is also the reason that I've never dined in at this location- wasn't sure if I could risk my life even though the breakfast buzz is so unbelievably good."}
{"text":"I had the California Club breakfast sandwich!  It was amazing!  Although it was small venue the food was great. Just wished they had more seating and glad I rode my bike there - limited parking."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place...but it did not go well.  I never noticed this restaurant although it is right next door to my favorite burrito spot (Super Burrito).  When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \"crunch\"!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and the extra star is for the customer service. Pulled in this morning when it was still dark. Mind you this is a drive-thru health food/coffee spot. Roughly 6:15, 6:30 AM. A guy was in there already with a smile on. Hard to find at that hour. I ordered a quad espresso with cream and the low carb breakfast. After he punched in the order I pulled kind of a d*ck move and asked for an extra egg. Told him he could charge me. He said no problem and told the cook to add the egg. Didn't charge any extra at all. Bonus! He had me test the espresso to make sure it was to my liking. It was fresh and strong. Cream was perfect.   Now the food. 3 perfectly cooked tender eggs on a bed of mixed greens with a pesto dressing. 3 tomato slices and 4 avocado slices. Also a thin hash patty. Everything was cooked perfectly and you could tell everything was very fresh. No weird tomatoes, no brown avocado. Everything was just right, even such an ungodly hour. The only recommendation I can make it put the hash patty on the side or on top so that some of the crispness would maintain. Other than that you can't get better service and quality and that early in the morning to boot. Highly recommend. I will be back for a lunch sometime.  PS I tipped him a few extra bucks before I pulled away. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! D'lish is conveniently on my way to work and I love the staff there. I tried this place for the first time about a week ago and there was a pretty solid line through the drive thru. I was extremely impressed with the friendliness and efficiency of the people who work there.   They have an extensive menu and I am sure many people (like myself) order food as well as a beverage when they go through the drive thru. For their location this can cause a bit of a squeeze as the line starts to get longer and longer and as does the wait time. But fear not!! A lovely D'lish employee walks outside, takes your order and payment, and BAM. Next thing you know, you have your delicious coffee and you are on your way! Don't fear the line. Seriously, you'll be taken care of.  As far as food goes, I've only tried the egg and cheese sandwich and it was a delicious breakfast indeed. Next adventure? the oatmeal. Enjoy my friends, and get your D'lish ON."}
{"text":"The BREAKFAST BUZZ!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!  I wish that I could have one of these everyday!  It is a patent-pending protein drink with espresso, chocolate, protein powder, banana, peanut butter, milk, vitamins and I think that is it! My friend introduced this to me and I do not even like coffee, but this drink is F'in Fantastic!  I love the vibe here...everything is fresh here!  I also tried their hummus plate with chicken and it was like the best hummus I had ever had!  It has some fresh veggies with it and a flat bread.  The Berries and Nuts salad is awesome too!!  The inside is cute! They have a drive thru if you are in a huge hurry!"}
{"text":"This really deserves a 5 for the food and exterior of this building.  However the 3 rating is for the poor service I have received the last 3 times.  So, I called in a phone order and arrived to pick it up in the drive thru and waited 10 min.  Not sure what was holding up the joint, but made me late for work !!!!  no one came out to take orders and the line was wrapped around the building.     Then I get to the window.... and a snotty little girl standing there taking money and giving orders.   No smile and showed a horrible attitude.   I will not be back for awhile.  Your tempe location workers are worse."}
{"text":"I've never had something from D'lish that I didn't like. The chicken panini and breakfast club are two of my favorites. Dirty chai vanilla latte rocks my socks. The only bad thing I could say about this place is sometimes the wait kind of sucks, but for the delicious food and drinks it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast sandwhiches, coffee drinks, and customer service. My only hope is that they come out with flavored cream cheeses down the road. Love that their food is healthier than your typical fast food as well."}
{"text":"Interesting little place.  Seems more suited to the drive thru crowd but they do have a small dining area inside and a little patio too.  We were staying down the street at the Four Points Sheraton and needed some breakfast so we took a quick walk down here.  We weren't really sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich with chicken sausage and it was tasty and filling!  I also tried the cactus fruit iced tea and it was great.  My friend had the croissant sandwich with pesto and it looked good too.  Wish there were more of these places around."}
{"text":"This little place is great (emphasis on LITTLE). This place is always packed for good reason but the wait to park or get through the drive thru takes a bit away from the appeal of a quick and healthy meal. That being said the speed is only slowed by the traffic. The food and drink are always ready promptly. The food is awesome and they are friendly to those with special diets. My top picks are the Breakfast Buzz, butternut squash soup, and California club. They have a soup and salad combo that hits the spot! Those are my top three but everything I've tried is very good and they have a patio that is doggy friendly.   The only other thing I might add is that this isn't the cheapest place but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I just had my first -- and certainly not last -- meal from D'lish!  My food was packed with flavor and delicous fresh ingredients.  The service was super friendly and fast, too.  I can't wait to try more from their yummy-looking menu!"}
{"text":"Was eating my AZ burro that I love so much and a black hair started to pull out of it  I'm so sad right now not even mad. Put ya damn hair in a net or something next time."}
{"text":"the breakfast buzz is life!!!!! Price is good service is quick food is yummy. I hope they open more locations."}
{"text":"Went here recently since I was craving a nice breakfast sammie. I went through the drive-thru and the service was fast and easy. In terms of the actual breakfast, I ordered the breakfast club which was ok. The egg and bacon were kind of lukewarm and could've been a little warmer but overall it was a nice breakfast drive thru and definitely felt healthier than the fast-food chains all around town!"}
{"text":"One of my regular breakfast spots  This place rules except for the amount of space they have to serve the people coming in. Aside from that the food is good and is consistently quality for the amount of people that come in.. It's hard to find a healthy option and a not healthy option without sacrificing taste. So I get my happy unhealthy option and my girlfriend can have her weird tasting quinoa oatmeal."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for vacation, and we got D'lish both of the days we were in the area. Do yourself a favor and order ahead so you don't have to wait in the drive thru, then just pick it up in the store.  I got the California Club both days... absolutely phenomenal! It was so amazing I'm going to try to replicate this recipe at home... it's going to be difficult, but this was best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. My friends got other breakfast items and they raved about it as well, very good joint."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place as a healthy lunch alternative and I was pleasantly surprised. This is a cute little place in a strip mall off Shea with a nice lunch seating area. Since we didn't have a lot of time we decided to just order wraps. I ordered a Humanitarian with chicken and a breakfast buzz (to go). Sometimes wraps end up too dry or too moist depending if there's any kind of additional sauce. While nicely prepared and full of healthy veggies and hummus, I'm not sure if there was enough chicken in it to justify the up charge. As far as the breakfast buzz, be prepared, it's sweet, thick and could be considered a meal in itself. I had a few sips, got a good taste of it and then took the rest home. If you're in the mood for a quick meal, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"All the salads from here (we tried the nuts and berries and the man salad) were really good. The Veggie bowl is more of a soup and pretty good (we had it to go). I had the veggie wrap and it was the perfect portion for one person. The protein shakes here are HUGEEEEE. I felt like all the good was tasty, well prices, good quality and made you feel good about what you were eating. I would definitely come back again. Great place to eat at before or after a hike. :)"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? Places like this come by almost... um never. The manager is the funniest person I have ever met. The breakfast buzz is probably not legal. I am in love!"}
{"text":"To the very nice lady who was working this morning taking orders on April 26, 2017, after sitting in line and forgetting my wallet last minute, she asked what I wanted (Breakfast Buzz), she said to not worry about it and she put it on the house. So thank you very much for that kind gesture early in the morning, I didn't catch her name!"}
{"text":"Awesome little college breakfast nook. Close to campus with unique and delicious options including fresh juices!"}
{"text":"Disaster! I guess I don't get the allure of this place, and my biggest complaint...one that tops very average food will probably be scoffed at.  That being said, here we go.  Never, I repeat never, order the breakfast sandwich with no cheese. Apparently, that was the secret ingredient meant to hold the entire average sandwich together.   Imagine my shock opening this puppy to have it explode all over my car when pulling out of their drive thru. Thousands of pieces of sandwich over the car...not my belly, where an $8 breakfast sandwich belongs.  Cheese. It's what the Knights Templar smuggled to America to mend average sandwiches together."}
{"text":"Loved that I could get \"breakfast\" for lunch.  Great healthy food.  The staff was super friendly.  Got to sit outside ons sunny day.  And, it was not expensive and quick.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dlish quite a few times but always waited in the drive thru which is this place's only downfall, my wife and I actually parked and ate out on the patio today. %100 better, the food was on point! Had the az burro enchilada style. Golf clap for the food, thumbs down for the size of the place. They lose a lot of buisness over people driving up and seeing the line out to scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"I love stopping here for a quick bite to eat during lunch or breakfast. The traditional burrito is really good. Has the perfect egg to potatoes ratio. Last time I had lunch here I had the chicken pannini with pesto and sour dough bread. Arnold Palmers are the best here too!"}
{"text":"After our last visit being disappointing, the owner contacted me and offered to make things right. Another example of why I feel this place is so great! (Besides their delish food!!)"}
{"text":"Glad this exists. It is kinda expensive actually. I spent 15 bucks for a bowl and a drink. It was decently tasty. Wonder if it was really that healthy. Give me Native Foods over this any day."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that this place really does have excellent food. Two two meals that my friend and I ordered were delicious. It was served quickly and the food was prepared just then and still super hot. The customer service was great too. Unfortunately, the place is very, very small and there is no way to escape the door or the noisy blender. I was looking to sit down and have a nice conversation with my girlfriend but we were constantly interrupted by the loud blender and we were freezing so we had to leave. I'd recommend this place if you're looking at picking up food and leave."}
{"text":"We were waiting for the poke place to open up and stumbled across this little place. I got the cactus blossom tea which was good. I liked how it was unsweetened."}
{"text":"What can I say? Wow!! Obsessed with the buzz and the California Club sandwich!! No wonder the lines are always out the door."}
{"text":"This little gem has the best breakfast croissant I have ever eaten!!! Superb! The chai tea latte and orange glorious are also great!    There's limited seating inside and some outdoor seating, but when in a pinch, there's always drive-thru!"}
{"text":"OMG! The house farmhouse frittata is D'lish for sure!!! My taste buds fell in lust at first taste. Food Porn in FULL EFFECT! ...plus to really indulge in naughtiness I ordered my Dirty Chai EXTRA EXTRA DIRTY! y u u u m"}
{"text":"You want healthy drive thru food that is not grease & packed with a 1,000 calories. Then this is the place! It is a diamond in the rough. I LOVE the Breakfast Buzz! Their wraps are awesome! Everything is great!!"}
{"text":"yummy !  nom noms :-))  every time I've been here, it's been delicious ;p   and any out-of-town family & friends have liked it, too"}
{"text":"D'lish.. it is absolutely Delish!  The food is fresh and tasty!  The location is in a good spot, right before you hit the main part of Scottsdale.  It has a DRIVE THRU!!  Brilliant idea!  The seating inside is tiny, which makes it difficult to sit down and have lunch with a friend.  There are no heaters outside, so if it's a cold Arizona day and there are no spots inside, you're out of luck.    The morning buzz with almond milk was absolutely delicious!  My friend had the California club and it was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious!  I will definitely come here again for breakfast or lunch and use the drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place to go! I usually stop by when I want light, healthier food but they do have more filling options forsure! The food selection is definitely vegetarian friendly which is amazing! They have a broad selection of food as well as beverages from protein shakes to coffees and teas! I feel like the wait is never too long especially for the quality of food I'm getting! The staff is always kind and gets my order right every time! I love that they're expanding and making new locations too!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Was leaving town in the a.m. by car, passing through from Los Angeles. Googled a healthy spot in Scottsdale. D'Lite popped up and was perfect. Under $10 for a burrito. Healthy. Fast. Fresh.   Love the drive-thru! Thank you for caring about human's health in this fast paced life."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try out this place for a while and finally got a chance to stop by. The food was mediocre but overpriced and the portions were small, pre-made eggs and such. There was trash overflowing, on tables, and all over the floor. Dead plants and open peanut butter containers sitting out for the MANY flies to get to. The service was bad. The man working was on his cell phone yelling about having money stolen from him and spent the rest of the time looking at motorcycles online.   I used the bathroom, which has no air conditioning and no working faucet. I got a glimpse of the kitchen and, again, it was worthy of  a cringe.   I was almost unable to eat my sandwich when it came. I was a little worried I'd get food poisoning.   Stay away from this location: bad service, expensive food, and extremely unsanitary."}
{"text":"My first breakfast at D'lish was so good I had to come back a couple days later.  This is one of the best drive-through restaurants ever.  They use flavorful, quality, natural ingredients yet still manage to crank out tasty food very quickly.  Hopefully you don't need to eat in your car, but if you do D'lish is the ticket.  -- Traditional breakfast burrito, $4.75/$6.25 w/ meat: Score!  I have had a lot of breakfast burritos and this ranks up there as one of the best, if not the best, ever.  The chicken sausage was a total winner and the cheese was out of this world.  You might think $6.25 is a little pricey for a breakfast burrito but the ingredients are sooo good that it is totally worth it.  -- House blend smoothie, $4-5: This smoothie ranks up there with anyone else's.  A must get if you want to kick start your day with some blended fruit rather than caffeine."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast sandwiches and burritos very delicious and filling. The coffee is so good good with so many options to customize it to your taste. I loveeeeee that its a drive thru . its time that there was a better breakfast option that's fast and tasty."}
{"text":"Super fun friendly and good.spot for breakfast.  Its hard finding a good quality drive thru. We are always on the go and can't find good places to stop for breakfast and this is perfect. The people here are so positive and the menu is good and fresh and healthy.  The burros and sandwiches are full of flavor they are filling and I'm addicted to the veggie burro. The prices are good and the drinks seem good, I've yet to try them but will. Great spot definitely a fun and delicious spot to grab a quick but real good bite."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing.  The menu is healthy and extremely creative at the same time.  Faves right now are green lemonade smoothie and traditional breakfast burrito with chicken sausage and chipotle aioli."}
{"text":"Southwest bowl is the bomb! Fresh food. Nice service.  Truly Delish! However, they need more indoor seating space and extended hours."}
{"text":"This was only our first visit but it was so good that I had to give them a five star rating.    We each had the traditional burrito, which they kindly substituted egg whites for the eggs.  The burrito had a thick layer of eggs, along with melted cheese and a layer of potatoes and the tortilla wrap was fresh and warm.  It was so good.  They served salsa along with it and it was such a great addition.  We both ate almost the whole thing and that's saying something because the portion is decent.  I always try to leave a little of whatever but it was hard not to finish each and every little bite of that wrap!  We also each had a decaf Americano and those were fantastic.  Decaf is often so bitter but this was one smooth cup of coffee.    We're returning tomorrow to try something else.  That's the plan now but it's going to be hard not to repeat today's selection.  We'll see.  *Returned the next day and I had the same thing but my husband had the az burro that was similar to the traditional burrito but had smoked turkey, avocado, egg whites, hash patty, tomato & feta, wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla and he said it was very good.  Mine was as good as the first time I had it.  But next time I think I'll try the oatmeal.  It's made with organic quinoa, vanilla macaroon granola, maple syrup, fruit and steamed milk.  That definitely sounds good!"}
{"text":"Sooo GOOD! Looking for a healthy find?? This is your place! Super cute, healthy, and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it. I'm always searching for a quick healthy bite. Saw D'lite on my daily commute, Was thrilled to see they have a drive through. As I turned around to give it a go, I began to daydream about an easy morning commute with healthy, quick food. I ordered the \"baked\" veggie frittata. The only thing baked is the person who swears this is baked. It was nuked. So obviously microwaved!! Spongey and tough. I'd love to know where the veggies were. Was absolutely HORRIBLE and inedible. Took so freaking long to get it too, and I was the only car in the drive through, the inside didn't appear busy. Would have made me late to ask for a refund. So I'll just Yelp my review instead, hoping to save some other poor schmuck their time and money.  Too bad, I would have stopped daily.  The search continues.  ***update from 1 star to 2 because I was contacted after my review posted. Offered a free frittata to make up for my experience. Very impressed. Will update review after I take the manager up on his offer."}
{"text":"Healthy food but I was still a little hungry. Its good that it doesn't weigh you down. Maybe eat one or two of the AZ Burros before a marathon race. Parking can get hairy as the drive thru line goes out to the street blocking thru traffic."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this location a few years and enjoy the food, however have found much of the staff to be snobby. I stopped by over a week ago & tried to do two orders in the drive thru, to which I was explained they can't do. Over a year ago they could so I'm not sure what changed. Understanding however, my friend and I went inside, where the same person was running both the register. To describe her, hispanic dark haired with some sort of octopus tattoo on her arms. When I asked for my food to go she snarked \"it already is to-go because we close in 30minutes\" then was unable to make me a latte for the same reason... they won't make any fresh espresso 30 minutes before close. Apparently couldn't make a dirty chai either, by the lack of chai mix in whatever-they-served-my-friend. The cashier made it clear she didn't want to have to take any time past the 2:30pm summer closing hour to clean the establishment by her remarks. I will probably come back for a healthy bite on the go, but y'all certainly need to step up your customer service."}
{"text":"D'Lish has been a personal favorite for over a year now. I live at the halfway point between two locations, so I trade off which one I visit pretty frequently. Fortunately, both locations feature the same level of quality service and delicious food.  The California Club sandwich remains at the top of my breakfast cravings list and the Breakfast Buzz is just way too good to *ever* pass up!  I've driven here, ridden my bike here, eaten in, taken out and the experience has always been positive. The ambiance is organic and trendy and casual with a strong hint of hipster mixed in as an added bonus.  Everything on the menu has been really well thought-out to provide healthy, truly mouth-watering options for the discerning foodie. Really can't recommend this place highly enough. If you haven't been, GO. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The one on Apache Blvd fixes the only thing wrong with the Scottsdale location.  Parking.  Plenty of it.  Otherwise, same great D'Lish.  I hate lunch the other day for the first time, having to get something off my beaten path of either the AZ Burro or the Breakfast Buzz.  I went with the Southwest Rice Bowl.  Also amazing.  Everything at D'Lish is top notch.    I go to a D'Lish EVERY DAY I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"I visit Arizona every two months for work, and make it a point to always come here for breakfast.    I doubt anywhere else compares, and I wouldn't even risk finding out, because that means I'll miss out on either an AZ Burro or a Breakfast Buzz.  Healthy Drive-Thru?  Impossible!  D'Lish made it happen, and they are quick.  Even if there's a line, there will be someone taking orders so that the visit is as quick as possible.  I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  There's a large menu, and I'm sure it's all wonderful, but the AZ Burro and Breakfast Buzz are FANTASTIC.  It starts the day off right.  Do not order both in one sitting...    Parking is tough if you want to go inside.  That may be the one caveat if I were to think of one."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Tempe location for years but today was likely my Last trip.   My one year old has a very severe sesame seed/hummus allergy. I let the guy at the drive thru know so that they could make sure there was no cross contamination. He totally blew it off \"uhh okay see you at the window\". I didn't feel like he heard me so when I got to the window I asked the gal if he noted the sesame allergy - as there have been mistakes at other restaurants before and she has had severe allergy attacks. The girl looked at me and said \"I don't know, your food will be ready shortly\" and closed the window. THEY LITERALLY DID NOT CARE AT ALL. My food was fine but they totally blew me off which made me uneasy- it's not fun for me to have to be extra cautious but my child could literally die from cross contamination. It seems like they are in educated about the severity of food allergies.  Oh and I ordered her the oatmeal but it was just a cup filled with milk and quinoa. They forgot the oats and it was totally inedible so I had to throw it away. It was like quinoa soup. I'm really irritated. See attached picture"}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale and wanted a quick breakfast on the weekend. So I stopped by d'lish .  I got the California club which was amazing. It has turkey, bacon, cheese, egg and avocado. It's an awesome breakfast sandwich .  Everyone was nice and my sandwich wasn't to long of a wait . They also have a drive thru which is awesome for a nicer breakfast place than mcdonalds .  I will definitely be returning ."}
{"text":"Very convenient drive-through but it closes way too early and the prices are outrageous for their mediocre food. The employees are pleasant!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in town. A true \"local\" choice. The almond buzz shake is my go to but the veggie burrito is my addition if I need a more hearty meal. Be prepared to wait a little bit on weekends and during peak hours. It's a small place and very popular."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Fast AND healthy food? That's almost unheard of. I wish they were open later than four pm so I could come in for dinner too. They also have vegetarian and vegan options. The person who helped us was extremely helpful and patient.  Had the humanitarian wrap without feta and it was the perfect summer time meal. Paired great with the pomegranate green. ..and I also drank half my husband's four berry smoothie because it was so delicious. I'll be back to try the black bean and quinoa burger for sure. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing breakfast spot, I usually go here once every weekend. The staff is super friendly and down to earth, and they have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu. I usually get the veggie burrito, which I highly recommend. The drive-thru is fast, which I thought was amazing for a health food spot. Make sure to get their fairly early on the weekends though because sometimes the line can get pretty long, but it moves fairly quickly.   I have yet to try any lunch items here yet, but I'm planning on it since their breakfast items are so good!  They also do a punch card, where you can get a free drink if you fill one up, coffee and smoothies included."}
{"text":"Not your typical oatmeal here, steamed milk with some granola on the side and fruit with some sweetness from maple syrup.  Quinoa all at the bottom as you scoop each time. The breakfast buzz, there is some coffee, the chocolate syrup can be overpowering though.  Overall very good still."}
{"text":"Food and drinks here are a lil overrated. Staff is friendly enough, but the low rating is strictly for the guy who I think is the owner or manager. I kept trying to give this place a chance, but each time I would witness this guy be so rude to guests and then myself. First example, 2 girls sitting at the coffee bar talking about the night before, not being loud or obnoxious just being girls... This guy yells at them bc he hears them say a bad word and says \"where do you guys think you are?! This isn't a bar! You need to leave if you're gonna keep talking like that.\" Next example... A group of us went in there for breakfast one Saturday morning and my friend Kevin was kicked out bc this guy heard him swear... My third and last visit there... My friend and I were waiting for our drinks (this place is tiny and not much standing room) I'm telling her about my other 2 visits here and point out the guy to her... Sure enough he yells at us and says \"you girls need to get out of my way!\" I'm like \"there is no where else to stand\" he rolled his eyes and just walked off in a hurry. I get that cursing is inappropriate, but both of these times people were talking amongst their friends, not being loud or obnoxious. And to be honest, in both cases I never even heard the cuss word used, all I heard was this dude scolding people. The only person that's loud and obnoxious there is him. Like, I just wanna get a cup of coffee, not be scolded for saying \"dammit\" or for trying to find standing room in this shoebox"}
{"text":"All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection."}
{"text":"The original location on Scottsdale Road was definitely a staple back in my Old Town party days. Nothing cures a hangover quite like that breakfast buzz. My only complaint about the Scottsdale location was that it's ALWAYS super busy, and there's not nearly enough parking/drive thru space to accommodate all their customers. This location is much bigger, with ample parking and a huge dog friendly patio. My sister and I came around 830 on a Sunday morning and there was no wait at all. We split the California Club and the Croissant Sandwich. The Cali Club is my absolute favorite - super soft fresh bread, egg, turkey, avocado, tomato, cream cheese, pepper jack, and pesto. On second thought, I actually don't know how healthy this ends up being, but it's probably miles better than the chorizo breakfast burrito I could've scarfed down instead. They also offer doggie bags for $1.50 - leftover rice and turkey that my monster pup absolutely loved. For lunch, their man salad topped with a tuna stuffed avocado is AMAZING. You can't really go wrong with anything - it's all delish!"}
{"text":"Jut got some breakfast here with one of my girlfriends. My friend ordered the breakfast club and she said it was good but not as good as the California club. I ordered the veggie burrito and it is delicious I also asked for a gluten free option and they had a gluten free wrap which was amazing. I also got a vegan buzz. Last time I got it they make it very sweet to the point where you can not drink it, but this time I asked for only half of the peanut butter and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to my boy Chris B. for telling me about this spot. He was right - this place is terrific.   I've only been once so far, but am already conniving a plan to return! I went with a friend and shared food so I got to try 2 things. Traditional Burrito + bacon, and Breakfast Club on wheat. I truly enjoyed both. Hit the spot without over-doing it and making me feel groggy.   To wash it down I had a dirty iced chai - one of the best I've ever had. I recommend it. Next time I'll listen to Chris and get the \"Buzz\" which is \"patent pending\" and per C.B. \"one of the best inventions of the 21st century\"... I know what you're thinking, and I was afraid too. Hence why I went with the chai. Next time - I'm buzzin'!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buzz is a must!! California club is my fav bfast sandy. It's absurd how busy this place is.... I recommend going mid-day."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing California Club and AZ burro (couldn't decide which was better!) We will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Vegan breakfast buzz! Bagel chips! The man salad!!! I'm here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the staff not so much. A lot of attitude from multiple servers. Tempe location is much more friendly and a better environment."}
{"text":"This is one of my usual breakfast places but they lose the 5th star because twice they've forgotten about my pickup order and left it sitting on the counter while I wait for them to call it out. The food is great and the service is otherwise pretty good. My girlfriend loves the Breakfast Buzz smoothie and I like any of their sandwiches that involve turkey.  A tip for diners, do not go through the drive-thru. You will get your food indoors so much faster. I can never understand why people wait in a line seven cars long instead of parking and walking inside directly to the counter. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was excited when this location opened up since I had gone to the South Scottsdale store for years. This location does not make the D'lite products to their own standard.  I've watched several times now as the guy making the Buzz drinks kept refilling the pitcher with more ice and syrup, no other ingredients. I'm not paying $6.50 for syrup and ice. I complained to the management about this exact thing and nothing has been done, now I'm done. Never got a crap drink from South Scottsdale location. I've spent hundreds of dollars here in the last few months. Go to Protein House, Smoothie King or Onestop if you want a breakfast shake."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not the best I have ever eaten! Will I go back? Yes! However after being there 3 times the only food items I think really make the cut are the sandwiches and burritos!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch food in Scottsdale.  Very cool that you can do drive-thru and come in for a quick, delicious meal."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best breakfast spots in Scottsdale, and one of the quickest too!  I ordered the California Club Breakfast Sandwich and was blown away by the taste. So good.  The customer service is excellent, the food was ready in minutes, and it was way healthier than your average \"fast food\" for only a few dollars more.  They have a drive-thru if you're in a hurry, but if you're not, I suggest stopping in and relaxing with your meal on their lounge chairs!"}
{"text":"I ordered a California Club and croissant. I recommend the California Club. It was so good, especially the green sauce in it. I bet it's their homemade sauce(maybe with basil, I am not sure but it tastes so good). I really wanna go back and have that everyday! Unfortunately, I am not living there lol Beside, they provide drive through but it's kinda slow. I wanted to drive through at first, but I changed my mind then parked the car and sat in the restaurant. It's much faster. Overall, I like the California Club so so much!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab lunch, and do a little work that requires wifi.  I found this place one day just driving around and stopped for a cup of coffee, they had wifi, but I couldn't connect to my vpn.. but that has been fixed and they probably have one of the robust wifi locations around!  But first, let me talk about the food and the service.  It seems like EVERYONE that comes here is a regular, including me.. but no worries, you will be treated like a regular the minute you walk in.  The folks that run the place all seem like they LOVE what they do, love talking to customers and take pride in what they do, which is provide great food with some nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the berry salad in a wrap. But I need my coffee first.  This place has a great vibe and it's healthy and Eco-conscious. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I had read so many wonderful reviews about this place so I had high expectations.  I also thought it was a cheap place, but I see that you don't get much for the price you pay.  I ordered the Cali Club and was not impressed by it.  There was too much cream cheese so it overtook the sandwich, rather than just make a mark on it.  We ordered my son a quesadilla and a green smoothie.  The smoothie was fine and the quesadilla was meh.  I would not come back, but it's just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Ok, I pretty much love this place! The dudes that work here and/or own it are very cool and friendly.  They aren't bad to look at either, I'm just saying. I just like to hang out here.  They are doing some remodeling and in general making this place even better. They are adding some sort of juice bar component soon, which is great.   One dude knew who I was by my Yelp review, which was cool & a little scary.  He had a great take on Yelp though, and has the right attitude that a lot of the feedback can be constructive.  One guy working there wasn't a Yelp fan, which was fine with me, he gave perfect service and made me feel totally welcome.  I respect his point of view. We all don't have to like the same things...right.  They know my stance on pillows there, and I would love it if they would stay open longer on weekends. I will bring my own Baileys....Please!!!!!  Seriously great place."}
{"text":"D'lite is one of those businesses that you always go to and shake your head saying \"you're too big for your britches.\" LA Milk Depot is the same way - cars line up down the road waiting in line to get to the window. It is a good problem to have, I suppose.  I've had their smoothies, teas, and breakfast sandwhiches. All delicious. There isn't much to wonder why people clog up Scottsdale Road waiting to get in line for this place.  I also like that the people taking the orders walk down the line and take orders. I'd hate to see the line and how long it took if they didn't."}
{"text":"great taste. dishes are a little smaller than what I am used to."}
{"text":"Great spot to pull through once and a while for a blended coffee drink and breakfast sandwich / burrito"}
{"text":"Always always always great food and GREAT service!  Small space and almost always crowded (but hey, that's D'lish), they do a great job of serving you fast.  Managers make an effort to know you and take extra good care of regulars, service in general is always great... the kind of place whereupon, given a problem or delay with you order, you just really don't mind all that much.  Biggest issue: stupid customers who seem unwilling to get out of their cars and mindlessly join the drive-thru lemmings even though they're blocking traffic on Scottsdale Rd.   No, there isn't a great deal of parking, but there's enough... and going inside is usually faster.  Like everyone else... I'm partial to the Low-Cal Breakfast (holy-shmoly its yummy!), the Nut-and-Berries Salad (also yummy), hummus plate (just right), various sandwiches, and seem unable to avoid a Breakfast Buzz (ever)."}
{"text":"California Club is THE BOMB DOT COM!!! No substitutions needed!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come back into town, my first stop is D'Lite (formally Dlish which I still call it that lol) and I pick up my breakfast California Club with no tomato. I can never finish in one sitting but I try. It is so damn good, I look forward to my trips back to PHX just so I can get my D'Lite fix. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just went through drive thru at 9:55am and the girl with shorter hair working the food window was very unhappy and rude. She didn't know my order and was just surprised at the unpleasant experience, it's not like D'Lite."}
{"text":"Came here because of the 4 stars Yelp review. I am very disappointed I their low carb breakfast and traditional burrito. I thought it would be tasty but taste like what Denny's. Nothing special. I expected more flavor but the sauce that they used for the low carb breakfast does not live up to my expectation."}
{"text":"So yeah, no time for a decent breakfast but want something good than the average McDonald's? Something perhaps healthier? Well, you have found your place here at D'Lish.    Granted it was my 1st time, so will have to go back for more.  Had the California Club, it was really good.  Did drive through and they had a guy walking out there taking and expediting orders, which was really great, and he was cracking jokes which made waiting just a bit a little more pleasurable."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested this place and I had my doubts, but it ended up loving it and going back a couple days later!! Their Southwest rice bowl is mouthwatering and the black bean chips are amazing! I will definitely come back here again and again!"}
{"text":"I love the turkey sandwich and the man salad its d'lish  the only down side is the hours"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been going there a couple years.  The food is great,  the green tea is some of the best!   Staff is attentive and gets to know the regulars!   The only Complaint is the parking, or lack there of.   Great having a place like this in the neighborhood! !"}
{"text":"I got the man salad which had BACON, chicken, tuna, tortilla chips, avocado, tomatoes and mixed green with a blue cheese dressing. I have been eating a bunch of fried food so I craved a salad and even though this salad isn't the healthiest of salad it definitely was satsifying. It was a pretty big salad for under $10 and I loved the wooden bowl they served it to me in. I like the concept of fast healthy food since they had a drive thru but I opted for the dining in option. I went up to the counter ordered and they gave me a number and deliver the meal to my when it was ready.  It reminded me of a small hole in the wall coffee shop with plenty of great food options. I would love to come back here and try some of the sandwiches and other types of salads."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of \"breakfast for lunch,\" but I had one of their egg sandwiches for lunch the other day, and daaaaaaamn it was good!  Also, since they don't serve soda, I had one of their black teas.  It was excellent, too.  If you haven't been here yet, don't be fooled by the small size, check it out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Oh, AZ Burro breakfast burrito, how I adore thee. Then again, everything I've had for breakfast or lunch has been excellent. Love the breakfast bowls and salads... My one and only (incredibly minor and unimportant) gripe is that they are super liberal with the coffee creamer. SO. MUCH. CREAMER. EVERY. TIME. But, that doesn't really matter when you can stuff a delicious turkey, bacon and egg breakfast burrito in your face."}
{"text":"So awesome to see a healthy, fresh quick option in Tempe!  Do yourself a favor and get the Breakfast Buzz shake. Soooooo good! Chocolatey and sweet and amazing! :D I'm hooked.  The pesto croissant sandwich is a great breakfast option as well! I love the fast service and awesome food quality every time. The raw kombucha is killer too. :)  I'd love to see more vegan options!"}
{"text":"The ratings are not a fluke. These guys and gals are good. Had their signature california club and was not disappointed. Fresh, great flavor. Bread was awesome. Coffee was excellent too. Gotta go back. The menu had a lot of items I want to try. The flow of customers was constant. Great sign of quality over time."}
{"text":"So so happy this place is finally open!  What a great convenient place.  The decor is adorable and the breakfast and salads are great!!  Staff is friendly and it's a nice place to sit w my laptop and relax and enjoy a healthy snack!"}
{"text":"Damn! Double Damn!  This thing called breakfast buzz just buzzed me. I am addicted to this drink. It is a must try. The bagel egg sandwich was yum!  My new healthy place to frequent."}
{"text":"Sweet place.  Fresh food great coffee.   Fast & great service.  Great Concept for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Today is the 50% off everything menu!! Until 6pm. This is the time to try multiple items without regrets! And yes I did try several items.   Kitchen Sink Salad: Quinoa, beets, spring greens, carrots, jicama, cucumber, feta, golden raisins, balsamic vinaigrette and roasted bagel chips to tie it all together. Impeccably fresh and healthy! $8.25. Add chicken for $2  Protein burger House Style: house made quinoa and black bean burger with sliced portobello, creamy cucumber sauce, tomatoes and feta and pesto sauce to mesh the flavors together in between the toasted artisan bread. Optional to go Naked (no bread) on a bed of spring mix and balsamic dressing.  $9  Signature Tuna Sandwich: served hot or cold. Albacore Tuna mixed with their signature sauce, white melted cheddar, onions, celery, tomato, cucumber, dull on a multi- grain bread. Mmmmm for a cold windy day! $7.75  Croissant sandwich: a warm breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon tomato and pesto drizzle $6  Dirty Chai: comes in a choice of 12oz, 16oz or 20oz for $3.50/$4/$4.50 respectively. And of course went for the 20oz. I added soy milk.   Breakfast Buzz Shake: the best 32oz shake and their signature shake. Whey protein, espresso shots, peanut butter, nonfat milk, banana chocolate syrup, and other vitamins. $6. We ordered 5 of these. A couple to drink and the rest to give to friends! Yummmmm. They have the punch  card to get a free one after all 10 purchases are complete.   Their drive thru was just as long as a busy Starbucks line. Definitely worth  the wait. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've long believed that the only way for me to stay in shape was to eat food I didn't like. I obviously hadn't met the guys at this restaurant. Not only is the staff friendly and helpful, but the menu and the food is amazing.  At the owner's recommendation I tried the hot tuna sandwich and was blown away. Fresh Dill really made the sandwich pop And made it a totally different take on good old tuna. I can't wait for my next one. Good job guys!  I wish I would've taken a picture but the sandwich got destroyed way too fast for that. :-)"}
{"text":"Three words on D'lish: Simple, tasty and healthy menu.  My fiance and I ventured over to D'lish after hearing they recently started serving dinner. It's a small, but comfortable coffee house that has indoor and outdoor seating along with a convenient drive-thru for those on-the-go.   We ordered the new \"Man\" salad, margherita pizza and tomato basil soup. The man salad is quite a combination of flavors. It has a huge lump of tuna salad, avocado, bacon, blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes with creamy cucumber blue cheese dressing. The margherita pizza was small, but tasty. It's perfect for smaller appetites. Not a massive fan of the tomato basil soup. It was a little too salty, but not bad.   All in all, we had a great experience there and will definitely be back to try a few other menu items and the coffee."}
{"text":"D'lite reached out to me after my last review and invited me to come back and try them again. This time I tried the veggie frittata. It was definitely much better than the sandwich I had last time. The dish consisted of buttered toast and sliced tomatoes topped with a baked egg layered with brocolli then sprinkled with some feta and a pesto drizzle. They were much more generous with the pesto this time and everything tasted fresh. Yummy pesto! I wish the egg had a slightly lighter texture... it was a little spongey. I also think this dish could be improved in flavor and consistency with some different veggies... maybe mushrooms or red peppers. The broccoli was just kinda too much. If they're going to keep the broccoli it needs to be smaller. I just don't think large broccoli florets work that well in a small breakfast dish.  They also mentioned the tables in their message to me. They said they are ordering new ones,  but as of today the old tables are still there. There's also some confusion about the name. Some signs say d'lish and some say d'lite. Overall, this place has potential, and I will try it again. It just needs some tlc ie: fresh coat of paint, correct signage and menu tweaks. I received great service again so they have that part down."}
{"text":"Rolled in before my class at SCC, and had the place to myself. Snacked on the hummus and veggie platter (cilantro and jalapeno hummus was tasty and tangy!).  Sipped a lemonade, then got an iced coffee to go.  Wish this place was closer to my home, especially with the drive thru, but will definitely be back when I'm in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, delicious! Club sandwich is great! The pomegranate green tea awesome! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Quick and helpful service! Large portions and everything was honestly delicious :) only visiting town for a couple days but plan to come back for sure"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious iced coffee and turkey club sandwich for a post-ride lunch.  We were in town for Collegiate National Triathlon Champs and looking for a tasty but healthy place to nosh after exploring AZ on our bikes.  The waitress even gave us all free refills on our iced coffee!  Everyone's food was delicious."}
{"text":"Get the AZ Burro and the Breakfast Buzz. Not a cheap breakfast at $12 + tax, but it's so good and it'll leave you full for hours. Love the hash brown patty inside the burrito!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is fantastic and the staff is very kind. Everything is fresh and prepared to order. The only minus is the music is too loud and the speakers are so sharp, which is not a good combination (my rating would be 5 stars if the environment was more enjoyable But don't let that stop you from enjoying some excellent food."}
{"text":"This is the only food that is to-go healthy. There menu is really awesome, they have great smoothies. My hands down favorite is the AZ burrito. Only problem are the prices. A little over priced for most items , but being a healthy convenient options it's hard not to pay a pretty penny. Lastly, the Nitro coffee is the best coffee around. Definitely worth your dollar."}
{"text":"Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party"}
{"text":"This is a small, decent place to grab some food if there's nothing better. The people who work here are certainly nice enough.   The thing of it is, though, is that its overpriced for what you get, and the food isn't all that special. Its ok, not bad, but not great. Its also a bit strange to me that they close so early. Clearly they have no desire to serve extra late lunchers or any sort of dinner folk."}
{"text":"Well finished, delicious food! However, if you're going through the drive, call in your order! I recommend: everything"}
{"text":"Staff is rude; food is full of salt; portions not as advertised.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Yummy! 1st time visiting. Ordered the chicken panini and the man salad.  Both were fresh and totally delicious.  Freash, fast and wholesome. Prices were reasonable.  Service was fast and courteous.  Would recommend,  and will visit again."}
{"text":"First time visiting today and I am impressed. Best tuna sandwich of my life and the iced tea I had was incredible too. Tiny inside, but very cute. Staff members were super friendly, helpful, and quick. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Coffee is great, soy breakfast buzz is my favorite, tuna is awesome, veggie delite with turkey is awesome, hummus plate is awesome. all of the breakfast sandwiches and burrito are the best. basically everything I've had from D'Lish is really good. People are nice. I can't say enough about D'Lish"}
{"text":"Very convenient location. Tons of healthy options, great assortment of beverages. Reasonable prices. Do yourself a favor and check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! The staff there are always friendly and are so helpful at helping picking out anything your craving :) menu is not only healthy but delicious!"}
{"text":"I love all of the other locations but this one seems to lack each visit. I had the California club last time and the egg tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and then heated in the microwave! The staff is way less friendly at this location which is my biggest issue. The last three times I've been I said thank you as I would drive away and get no response. They make it an uncomfortable experience for me each time."}
{"text":"I haven't had the food there, but I love their iced mocha and their breakfast smoothie.  Very yummy and not ridiculously overpriced.  The atmosphere is very friendly.  This would be a great place to meet up with a group."}
{"text":"Incredible long waiting time for a drive-through! Strong discrimination! I ordered a frittatas, a California club and a salad, which made me wait on the driver through way for half an hour! Several cars behind me had their orders delivered before me and finally they asked me again what I ordered! If I could offer negative star, I will definitely do so!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but customer service could be better. They have a walkup window where I attempted to order a drink, but was told to come inside (leaving my food outside on the balcony to wait in a long line for a cup of water). Pretty inconvenient, considering there is a window for ordering, outside."}
{"text":"So the Breakfast Buzz shake... Best shake ever made! As for the food items, I've never been dissatisfied!! All breakfast items are out of this world, and the Southwest Chicken Rice Bowl is simply to die for! Such a better/healthier alternative to ANY fast food restaurant! Hope this organization expands everywhere!!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, healthy and enjoyable! Loved the healthy options and tea. Would highly suggest"}
{"text":"The Southwest rice bowl is so good! I hope it's good for you, because I felt like I was cheating on my diet. The one thing I didn't like is the parking lot at this location. It's a tiny parking lot with no way out if the drive-thru is full. Also if you're in the drive-thru and get your order before the car in front of you you're kinda stuck until they move forward. I drove by today and the traffic going into this business was a mess! So make sure you have time when you go."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great Orange Julius! Don't have a restroom though. When they put one in, they will go to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is cute, the food's yummy and the cute bearded men behind the counter made our first encounter even more fun. The hummus plate was delicious and robust...and only $5!  And they have a drive thru.  Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Wish I can give this place 10 stars. The Vegan Buzz is the best thing I have ever had in my life! And it has espresso!?! This location has easy access and is very comfortable. I will be back to try many of the recommendations like the California club and the wraps! Apparently they have more locations across the valley. I will be trying them all! Hope they live up to the hype of this one!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try the famous Breakfast Buzz drink. I did not like the fact that it was already prepared ahead of time. That might have caused some stomach issues. I paid and one second later there it was. I don't care if your busy, make my drink fresh or don't make it it all. Plus at about 6 bucks, I think they are taking advantage of consumers cause of the popularity of the beverage."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is so good! I've only had the breakfast sandwiches and the breakfast buzz so i can't talk for their lunch menus but I would definitely come here for anything. The food is always fresh and made to order and the breakfast buzz signature drink is so good! There's a drive they which is convenient unless it's too long it's impossible to get in line. the parking lot is also extremely tight and hard to park in. inside is a little small but it's a perfect little place to grab something fast and fresh to eat."}
{"text":"This is the perfect lunch fix. The strawberry salad is light and filling at the same time. The menu is local and it has a different small town feel than the other packed restaurant chains around."}
{"text":"The gal on the drive thru speaker was super chipper. I got an iced coffee and the southwestern bowl. The SW bowel was basically a soup, but it was still good. My girlfriend wasn't thrilled with her dirty chai but really liked her breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I'm addicted to their Caramel Lattes. I go here entirely too much. The staff is always the same and friendly (that's always nice to see the same faces there). They're very hospitable which is rare these days at many establishments and I never mind being in here since they'll chat with you while you wait. I have tried many items (fresh bagels and bialys, yummy traditional burrito, California Club, and my absolute favorite, the Low Carb Breakfast). This is just delicious!! Highly recommend and it's great they have a reward system with the Thanx app! I've earned a few free items since they told me about it."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! I get the Southwest rice bowl every time and am never disappointed. I always walk in for service because the drive-thru is usually 5 or 6 cars deep, so that sometimes slows down service. However, the food is great, employees are friendly, and I do not feel guilty after eating this \"fast food\". Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Tuna Sandwich  I have ever had. I wanted more and I had a whole one. Everything  tasted fresh, great flavor combo with all the non-traditional ingredients. My new favorite spot by work! Eating healthy with a drive thru is possible"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and its concept. I hope they open one in north Phoenix soon!!! So worth the drive to Tempe tho. Healthy breakfast and lunch, can't go wrong with a reasonable healthy option!! Thankyou Dlish for blowing drive thru healthy food out of the water!!!!"}
{"text":"D'Lish is DELISH!  I finally visited this darling establishment after reading my fellow Yelper's reviews, and I'm glad I did. The guys that work here are super friendly and super cute ( that is soooo inappropriate for me to say at this age)  and they can make a very nice latte and wonderful food! When you read that this is \"fast food\", don't be scared off that you are going to a chain-type establishment: this IS fast food that is freshly prepared and absolutely D'LISH!"}
{"text":"The California Club was excellent! I also tasted the low carb breakfast which was also very good. The staff was very friendly and the service was very fast! I will for sure get the California Club again!"}
{"text":"Love the healthy and delicious options. The quinoa version of oatmeal was amazing. Tuna sandwich was really good. The burrito bowl was yummy. Only complaint is the service. Multiple staff members haven't tried the food and can't answer seemingly simple questions like \"Does the breakfast burger have a meat patty?\" or \"How is this menu item?\". One of our orders had to be remade as we had requested the sauce on the side - if they had tried the dish they would know that doing that is a difficult task. Coffee was just ok."}
{"text":"My fiance and I needed a quick place to stop for lunch on our way between Sedona and Los Angeles.  We were driving through Phoenix, and we settled on D'lish because it was a well-reviewed drive-thru with plenty of options.  It was a good choice, quick, affordable, and tasty.  There was a short line for the drive-thru, but we were helped relatively quickly.  I was expecting a McDonald's-style drive-thru speaker system, but an employee came out and took our order while we waited in our cars.  The same employee then took our money at the pay window and maybe even gave us our food at the food window?  Is that too Looney Tunes?  Maybe there was another employee or just the one window.  Either way, he was a nice guy.  I ordered the combo lunch with a sandwich, a side, and a small drink.  I chose the turkey club, which was a pretty decent sandwich with smoked turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado, tomato, and lite honey mustard spread, served on toasted whole wheat.  It was a decently sized sandwich, not heavy but filling.  It was maybe a little dry despite having good turkey - less bread, maybe, or more mayonnaise would have done the trick.  I picked a soup for my side, a red pepper bisque that came with bagel chips.  This was excellent.  The soup was soothing and thick with tomato and red pepper, and the crispy bagel chips were perfect for dipping.  I'd definitely recommend a soup if you're coming through D'lish.  For my drink, I subbed in the Breakfast Buzz for a little bit extra.  I wasn't quite sold when I read the description on the menu, but as I often do, I let the voice of Yelp dictate my order.  This drink was a shake made with vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, and chocolate, blended with ice.  Pro tip, guys - don't lead with vitamins and proteins.  It makes your drink sound less delicious.  I'm glad I got the Breakfast Buzz against my fat-craving inner skeptic - it was fantastic, creamy and refreshing with plenty of banana, peanut butter, and chocolate to silence the healthier components.  We ate our lunch in the car and drove off in less than fifteen minutes.  It was a nice, efficient stop, and the food was well worth stopping for.  I'd recommend to D'lish to Phoenicians and weary travelers alike."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a healthy eating establishment.  I am usually on a very restricted diet no sugar no starch as well as the use of HCG and most diets now a days seem to be jumping on the same bandwagon.  Its all about eating clean.  Hormone free meats, fruits and veggies thats it so when I took a look at the low carb menu that came with hash browns for every low carb entree I was a little confused and disappointed but rather than try and decipher their menu I just told the lady taking my order that I needed something with virtually no calories like an egg beater omelet she said we can make you an egg white omelet which isnt really my preference but I figured my choices were pretty limited so I said o.k. then I sat down pretty much prepared to hate whatever they brought me.  These people know how to make boring egg whites taste good.  It came on a bed of greens with tomatoes and onions as I requested along with a few slices of avocado and a very tasty pesto sauce just enough to give it flavor.  I loved it and felt extremely satisfied even though it must have been under 250 calories.  I would definitely go here again and order the same.  Make sure you get there early for breakfast because seating is very limited inside and out.  There is also a drive through."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater but everything here looked amazing. I ordered the California Club and it was great! Once I was done I wanted to immediately go back. Thank god for self control :)"}
{"text":"great food, cool concept.  a little pricey and the location in scottsdale has a horrible parking lot."}
{"text":"Reg at the Scottsdale one.  1st time here rude service!! Wanna be hipsters that play to cool for school work here and food isn't as good as Scottsdale location.  Never will go back always pass it up on that side of town"}
{"text":"Consistently one of my favorite go to breakfast lunch brunch places. The food is clean and yummy. Buzz shakes will get you going, be careful they are addicting. Cali club, az burro, veggie dlite are all amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They are what they say they are.  Healthy fast food with a drive thru!  I love the morning buzz and so does everyone else that has tried it.  The burritos are so big they feed two people and the croissant wt/egg cheese and pesto sauce is really good.  They are a bit pricey and they dont provide nutrition info is why they dont get all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast stop! I had the low carb breakfast and it was absolutely delicious and I didn't have to feel guilty for eating it either!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, the service is fast and the food is magnificent.  As soon as I get in im asked about my day, typical but important. I have been to dlish many times but usually to the one in Scottsdale.  This one feels cleaner and gives off a better vibe. The staff all get along and joke around with each other. I love that. Food made with love. I usually order the early bird style burger, the one with the egg on it. I don't eat dairy so without the cheese I was disappointed. The burger is rather dry, but what can you expect when the \"meat of it\" *giggles, is made of a composition of quinoa and black beans? This past visit I ordered the house style burger. Good choice. It was delicious and I felt good after I ate it. Usually when I order its either one or the other. I will be a student at ASU next year and living in Tempe. I like everything about this place so much that I think I will even put in an appplication for a job here. no joke! To students who are health conscious, environmentally aware, and most commonly, on a budget, THIS is the place for you.  See you there!"}
{"text":"It really is delish! You can't go wrong with any option! Highly recommend! I love that breakfast is served all day. The line and the parking lot can be a bit frustrating at times, but that's just an indicator of a busy time and a great place to dine."}
{"text":"First time customer, and while the food was pretty good, it was rather pricey and customer service was mediocre. I don't think I will be back any time soon.  I ordered the chicken panini with soup and green iced tea. I asked for a splash of lemonade and was handed an Arnold Palmer. I was confused about the pricing of the combo, and when I asked the cashier for clarification, I got an attitude, and immediate \"do you want to cancel your order?\" which I felt was not necessary. While I won't be back anytime soon, D'lish is great alternative to Mc'D's."}
{"text":"People are awesome so nice and the food is great! I love the breakfast buzz and the California club!!"}
{"text":"Service was bad. They charge me for a for an extra meal because the lady did not listen. She wanted to get her own opinion across that I did not order correctly. I asked for two menus and  sat down. I asked her if she would take our order at the table. A simple yes or no would of been nice. But I was told.. like a child in front of my guest that not how they do it and next time I would need to go to the counter. There was no one in there.  Well I asked about one meal than order another she charge me for both and when I mention it she did not take back the meal I asked about and she did not give my money back. Another employee apologize for her treatment.  The oatmeal was water down grain of some sort and the meal that I did not order and paid for  I did not want.  End of the day if the service was better I might of given this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I hate to be a downer....  My dear friend and I came in after our mid morning trip to the gym hoping to get some coffee and a light bite.  I settled on the Organic yogurt and granola and a protein shake after asking a few questions about the granola (I don't like oily granola) and inquiring about the brand of protein powder used. I didn't feel like my questions were answered very well but I was hungry and it was crunch time. My friend got a vanilla latte and a tuna sandwich....we sat down....  I watch the guy begin to make my protein shake....The container for the Protein read Smart Gainer http://www.nextag.com/ids-smart-gainer/search-html 600 calories and counting.  read it for yourself...make since for a weight lifter or a very skinny person trying to gain weight....but I just came from the gym and worked really hard to run off those damn calories. I do not want my protein shake to be a weight gainer....I want in to be what it say it is...simple protein shake.....anyway I watched them make my granola as well...not Organic like they said. I think its important to use what you say you are using...they were using yoplait. Not organic. Humph.  On the other hand the tuna sand was pretty good....props on the sandwich but I'm not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"SO good and SO fast! I came with a group of 6 girls and everything we ordered was so delicious. The coffee was yummy too."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but the drive through sucks. No efficiency, even when there is one person in line it's never less than 5-10 minutes for a breakfast buzz. Rather than utilize the first window for quick items, such as a buzz, they make you wait."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome hidden gem! Never would have thought from the outside the greatness that lies within. The Breakfast Buzz was beyond amazing! The perfect breakfast protein shake of chocolate, PB and espresso. Went back 3 times in our week stay. Had the southwest rice bowl for lunch- very yummy and Fresh!"}
{"text":"D'Lish is an incredibly clean, gluten free, healthy eating type of establishment. I wish so much that they would open a location in North Dallas!!! My favorite is the Breakfast Buzz with each a protein shake, pretty much a tasty, drinkable breakfast. I got that after a recent 5k at one of their relatively newer locations in Tempe close to ASU. Great outdoor seating, or get it to go."}
{"text":"We are obsessed with D'Lite and frequent all of their locations when in town. The Breakfast Buzz is an absolute MUST! We get ours with almond milk. I love the croissant-which with pesto- it's so freaking good!"}
{"text":"I am a true fan! great for the vegetarian on the go :) DO NOT judge the D'Veggie bowl by its looks because it is fan-flippin-tastic! I wish they would come up with some other creative bowls though, they only have 2 to choose from and only one is for a veg. This place is true to the name, d'effing'lish :)"}
{"text":"My favorite drive-thru! I wish they would expand and open one in North Scottsdale. Only downside is they aren't open past 4."}
{"text":"I have been to D'lite before with my cousin, I would say some time last year. Now I'm a vegan, and I asked particularly about their burgers at the time and they said every single burger option out of the 3 that they make are vegan. Excited as can be I order the Top Notch Style option with \"bacon\", \"cheese\", and grilled onions. I felt quite sick after a couple of bites but I figured it would be from how heavy it was. Today I thought it would be fun to take my husband to the same place to split the burger, so he could try it, just to find out it is actual bacon and cheese they put on it. Someone told me it was all vegan, made me ill and they were pretty rude today when I said how upset I was that someone lied last time. As if it was a joke!?! I will never EVER recommend this place, as they don't take diet, or allergy's seriously. My body can not digest animal protein and causes internal bleeding."}
{"text":"Food was very good and seemed relatively healthy. Inside was very small and loud but the staff was friendly. I got the southwest rice bowl and loved it. The price wasn't bad for what you get. They do a very good drive-thru so the parking lot is kind of busy."}
{"text":"Cute Place, Good Music and atmosphere. Friendly Staff. The fact that theres a drive-thru with such a menu is awesome. However there are only a handful of parking spaces & places to sit. They also do not have a bathroom. Ordered a Breakfast Buzz & Iced coffee to drink. The Breakfast Buzz is AMAZING i highly recomend it. It is a blended beverage with expresso, vitamins, protien, & has a peanut butter/banana flavor."}
{"text":"Their \"low carb\" breakfast option said it had a hash patty and maybe it was a bad assumption on my part to think it was corn beef hash, not potato. I'm curious though as to why they would put hash browns in the \"low carb\" breakfast as that's the exact opposite of low carb. Anyhow it was basically a bowl of lettuce, raw tomatoes, over cooked microwaved eggs & hash brown potatoes. They are really nice at the counter though and have some good items on the menu that are not low carbs so I gave them 3 stars :/"}
{"text":"D'lish is just that D'lish, I can see why they named it that!!!  I have become a regular not only for the best Green Tea in the area but also the Men that always great you with a smile and a sparkling attitude whether they are swamped or you are the only person in the place!!!  Everything I have eaten there is D'lish but my personal favorite is the Turkey Club...  If you haven't been here it is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I loved my California club for 7.95! Eggs, bacon, turkey, tomato, avocado and pepper jack cheese on toasted artisan bread. The perfect warmth of the bread and flavorful taste of the pesto puts other club sandwiches to shame. Definitely enjoyed every bite of this sandwich  My fiancé got the breakfast club ($6.00). Nothing special about this sandwich...it tasted rather bland or maybe the sundried tomato bread overpowered the items inside the sandwich (turkey, tomato, eggs, bacon, etc).   Also got a caramel iced coffee. Very very good. Not too sweet, not too strong   Obvious that this is a very popular spot. The drive-thru line was sticking out into the street. While we dined inside (very small), many patrons came in to pick up their orders. Guess that's the norm there... I'd come back and repeat my order if ever I'm back in Scottsdale (California Club and Caramel Iced Coffee)"}
{"text":"The California club is amazing!! Definitely will be eating here often and can't wait to try more of the menu options! Friendly staff and I love the atmosphere inside too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Scottsdale stops for breakfast. The drive thru makes it super convenient and the food is always good. My personal favorites are the croissant sandwich and the az burro. Their coffees are also delish!"}
{"text":"Tried their \"Burger\" for the first time.....OMG horrible.  Tastes nothing close to a burger. It even looked scary.  Sorry but not for me.  Some of my co-workers wanted to give it a try and they spit out the first bite too."}
{"text":"Great food. A bit expensive for breakfast joint. Quick kind staff. Happy I found this place when I first moved here. A must try!"}
{"text":"Not McDonald's fast but still faster then In-N-Out yet amazingly good. Don't have a very good side selection at all. The woman who took our order was... eccentric and would be oblivious of who Emily Post is but was still charming and efficient."}
{"text":"We visited in hopes of a quick light lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  My assumption about this place was that they would be serving a light, fresh, and flexibly healthy menu. Although most of what they have seems to be fresh and healthy, ALL of their soups are dairy-based, and there's a lot of wheat, eggs and dairy products on their menu.   Prices seemed reasonable, and the staff were friendly and tried to be as helpful as they could. The Chef even came out and discussed my needs, but it seemed a bit of a stretch for them to adjust to accommodate my admittedly difficult dietary restrictions.  The only thing they could offer was a salad, and had to omit certain items.    While their menu boasts gluten-free and other individual allergen-friendly tags on some items, I was disappointed to find that they weren't readily able to produce more variety suitable to my needs.  I'd hoped for a more embracing healthy/allergen-friendly standard from this place, given their \"Health Conscious\" advertising.  Come on, guys - ALL dairy-based soups!?  Not really very healthy.  I guess I'd recommend you try this place because they were nice, tried their best, and are obviously a local business trying to make a go of it.  If you have food allergies, and want something other than Rabbit food, don't be fooled by their \"healthy\" offering."}
{"text":"I love their food. However, this location if horrendous for parking. I always call in my order for pick up and the line of cars is literally backed up onto Scottsdale Rd because of the drive-thru. But back to the food! Their Broccoli Side is amazing. Their Veggie d'Lite is amazing. I recommend getting it on wheat bread instead of the flat bread. The flat bread can get soggy. The food is well priced, fresh and always top notch. I know they can't do much about the parking issue, and I will continue to suffer through it because they are my go to lunch spot. As much as I want to shout my love for them from the rooftop, I'm hesitant to because I don't want any more cars blocking my lunch time getaway. If they had a larger parking lot, it would get 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"Local joint that excels at providing healthy but appetizing food quickly. Food was fresh and the long line at the drive through went super quick."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but sandwiches are kind of small. I ordered the breakfast club. It looked and tasted like I'd expect any bacon, turkey, tomato, etc sandwich to taste.  Nothing special to write home about. Is it sacrilegious or anti-foodie to say I might actually prefer McD's breakfast sandwiches?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The breakfast are delicious and the lunches are amazing. I love their black bean burgers for lunch and their breakfast sandwiches for the morning. I love that they have a drive thru. It's convenient and they don't sacrifice taste with it."}
{"text":"Let's talk about this, breakfast buzz. It's seriously my new obsession. It tastes so dang good. I actually love most of the food here. Their veggie burgers, on point. You can actually customize whatever you want here. I've done and they're really awesome about accommodating my pickiness. One thing I would like to see this place do, post the nutritional facts of their food. Maybe one day they will. I'd love it if they did. Holla."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Extensive menu, check it out........"}
{"text":"A reasonably priced, healthy option, with very good service.  The restaurant is clean, employees were very helpful with explaining the menu options - I've tried most of the healthy restaurant options for salads, sandwiches, wraps, and smoothies in the area and this location has the them all beat, especially on price with quality and quick service.  Coffee / espresso is excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent idea! Delicious, healthy food on the go. Their salads are to die for- none of that \"tons of lettuce, a little bit of toppings\" nonsense... the salads are PACKED with ingredients and have a wonderful balance of flavor.  Just be sure to remember when you're going through the drive-through: everything is made-to-order and perfection takes time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed two tasty meals here while I was in town. Even the coconut milk Latte was amazing. Breakfast burritos had me hooked."}
{"text":"There needs to be more fast food places that are super healthy and have awesome staff. I love their food, their shakes, their service and their concept! Get the breakfast buzz and you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I started going through the drive through back when it was Daily Rush and got to know the owners at that time.  I loved giving the local guy business.  When the new guys took over I was bummed to have to build a relationship all over again.  But I have to tell you they are kicking butt!!    The remodel is fabulous, the extension of the menu is great and they know what I want when I pull up.  Always nice to have someone know your drink :-)  I can't wait to try the dirty Chai!  Thanks so much for giving us this great drive thru in South Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"This is my coffee joint!  When I wake up in the mornings I either have a thrift mentality where I drink my god-awful office coffee, or a \"I don't care that I'm completely going broke\" mentality where I head to D'lish.  I would say that I fall into the latter category most days of the week.  Everyone on the staff totally rocks.  I usually hate my entire life and everything in it at 7:00 when I roll through there, but I always drive away with excellent coffee in hand and as much of a smile as possible on my face.  The prices are totally reasonable, and although I'd be irritated about the fact that they have UoP propaganda all over their cups, I find myself wanting to support them and have whoever started this wonderful business to make millions and millions of dollars.  Like some fellow reviewers I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  I generally stick with regular coffee in the morning, but every espresso drink I've had has been phenomenal as well.  Thank you D'lish for making M-F tolerable!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a college budget that at the same time offers good food. There food is all natural and is reasonable prices. There lemonade is perfect addition to add to your meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at D'lish with my boyfriend. We ordered the tuna sandwich and the early bird burger (which is not a burger, but a patty made with quinoa) and went halfsies on them, which is easy to do because they come cut in half already. To drink I got the kombucha, which I believe is GTs Original, and my boyfriend got the lemonade. Overall, our experience was excellent. The tuna sandwich was fresh and well flavored. The early bird was also good, but for me it was a little bit too spicy (and I love spicy), though my boyfriend who loves-loves spicy thought it was excellent. The ingredients tasted fresh and the food was reasonably priced for the quality and portions. The service was excellent and the staff very helpful. Our food came out quickly and so we were able to enjoy a healthy, delicious lunch in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! Always go by Yelp!! This place is amazing. Got the hummus wrap, green lemonade smoothie and the pomegranate tea.  Place was so clean  Bathrooms are clean  Great seating  Drive through as well!!!  Must try this place!!!  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"My favorites are the angry bird black bean burger, he chicken pesto panini, and a large kombucha! So many yummy healthy options."}
{"text":"When I read that D'lish was an \"alternative to fast food drive thrus\", I knew immediately that we should go here before a day trip on our vacation in AZ.  I'm glad to see that business seems to be good for this little restaurant with organic food. Hippies! We did drive through and though we did have to wait a few minutes longer than we would if we went to McDonald's, it was definitely worth the wait.  Here's what we ordered: Veggie breakfast burrito - this was definitely filling. I couldn't finish a whole burrito. Eggs, portobello mushroom, etc with salsa = delicious. Tuna sandwich - pretty tasty! Carb-free breakfast - the person liked it! The only complaint... there were too many greens at the bottom. It's great that they gave so much, but it was a little wilted from the heat of the breakfast items by the time we got to it. Veggie d'lite - yummy! Lots of greens."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment for over two years now. Not only is there food very healthy as well as their breakfast buzz very delicious,If you bring your furry friend they have dog treats for them as well when you arrive through the drive-thru.  My favorite menu item is the breakfast buzz, it is a mixture of espresso milk bananas protein and more! I would also recommend the California club if you are a chicken lover who also loves a good pesto sauce all in one sandwich. I recommend to come here during off hours from 1:51 PM as it can get very busy. Overall I highly recommend this Place for a quick healthy meal, five out of five!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot for lunch. Their sandwiches, especially the Cali club, are delicious and the patio was a nice place to sit outside once the weather cools down.    However now the patio looks like something from the apocalypse. Crows everywhere, garbage, bird poop, and worst of all syringes. That, together with occasional shady characters hanging out around the back parking lot is a dealbreaker for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The staff is always friendly, there's never a long wait, and the food is awesome. I usually get the Cali club and a breakfast buzz. Definitely try these two items your first time in."}
{"text":"Most of the staff here is amazing, and the management know how to run a business well and treat customers right. The california breakfast sandwich is a favorite, and their kombucha is top notch.  Lots of healthy options. Portions are solid. Flavors and ingredients are great. Keep it up."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz is a great option to start your day, but it is the only thing I have ever ordered so I don't know how accurate my rating would be for the overall menu. The other stuff looks delicious though but parking is a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"Let me start with the positives!   I love that this place is small and is very intimate with the customer. I also love the food selection when it comes to lunch. I got the California club and it was pretty dank, I can't even lie.   The negatives:  I think I came when it was under construction and the place was getting moved around. Also, I don't know if it is an espresso machine or what but it is EXTREMELY loud. To the point where my girlfriend and I stopped talking and ate our food so that we could leave and talk later.   If the noise problem was fixed, this place would be 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"Two words: AZ BURRO. That is what you must get at D'lish! It is absolutely amazing and I honestly crave it on the regular. It is packed with smoked turkey, avocado, egg whites, potato, tomato, and feta in a sundried tomato wrap. It is huge, super filling and only $7! I promise that you will not be disappointed! It is great for any time of the day, not just breakfast! Another one of my favorite things about D'lish is that they have \"doggie bags\" for $1.50 which includes leftover natural turkey and basmati rice...the pooches LOVE it!!!!! And for $1.50, it is a lot of food! The line is sometimes very long, but don't get discouraged, it is worth the wait! You're welcome!! ;)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I almost drove on by!  The drive thru line spilled out on the main road, and I was hungry.  At the last moment, I made an illegal U-turn and found some parking a block away.  When I got to Dlish, the long line was gone.    The friendly guy behind the counter took my order and gave me a number.  We sat at a table outside with our puppy.  Patrons were dog friendly and we didn't get any dirty looks.  When friendly guy showed up with my drink, he asked if our dog would like a treat and promptly brought him one.    California Club is as good as everyone says.  The Breakfast Buzz was even better than I expected.  The ice teas were also good.  Drinks come in big sizes.  That's the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it!"}
{"text":"Great choice of healthy menu options, excellent coffee and amazing customer service. Been waiting a long time for a health conscious concept that is fast and convenient in the Scottsdale/Shea area. The fact that you can call ahead for drive thru pick up is incredible and I will definitely be here often."}
{"text":"I love this place. If I could I would swing by every morning, but when I DO have time and want something SUPER yum-O, I get my tosh over here.   The drive thru is awesome (its so nice to have an alternative to Sbux!) The staff has always been super friendly, the food is YUM! And you have tons of options (which I love!)  I have only been inside once and the place is pretty cute. The blender is a little loud, so its not the ideal place to be if you need to work etc.. but still its adorable.  I usually get the breakfast club, no bacon on a sesame seed bagel and a large coffee, its so good....in fact, Im heading over there right now to get my fix :)   See you there my darlings !"}
{"text":"Great small place. Friendly staff. Nice menu. Perfect for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I'm not as crazy about this place as everyone else seems to be. For one, it's cramped and crowded, not an enjoyable or relaxing brunch place. It's really built more to serve the drive-thru clientele.  Secondly, the food is overpriced. We spent the same here that we would have spent at a fancy sit-down brunch, but for less quality food and a less enjoyable atmosphere. Thirdly, I did not like the food all that much, my breakfast sandwich was just OK and it was on store-bought bread, not freshly baked. It tasted like warmed up leftovers. And my husband did not like his coffee or his sandwich. The ONLY redeeming thing about this experience was the Breakfast Buzz smoothie! Lindsay J. (another yelper) was right, it is delicious! It tastes like chocolate milk, and you can definitely taste the espresso, bananas and peanut butter. I might come back for that smoothie, but otherwise I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Their menu had a variety of healthy vegan and vegetarian options as well options for your non-veggie friend. I ended up with the veggie d'lite. It had tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, cucumber sauce, and lettuce in a sort-of-pita-sort-of-focaccia wrap. The lettuce was not dressed and was the bulk of the sandwich. It would have been a lot tastier had the ingredients been mixed together prior to entering the wrap. I didn't expect it to be cheap, but $7 for this seemed a little on the pricey side considering it was just a wrap with no drink or side. Overall, it was a refreshing alternative to your typical drive-thru meal. I can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"The lemonade is amazing as is the tuna sandwich (make sure to get it hot). One of my fav places to get a quick delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"TWO THINGS: AZ BURRO & BREAKFAST BUZZ. That is all you need to be happy in life. Okay, well maybe that was a stretch but seriously, they're pretty darn amazing!!   The breakfast burro has been my go-to for years - it is in a tasty sundried tomato tortilla with egg whites, turkey, avocado, potatoes, feta cheese, and served with a side of salsa. I seriously dream about this burro on the regular.   As for the breakfast buzz - think rich, chocolatey shake but with espresso! It also has banana and other vitamins and goodies. It is the perfect start to any morning!  I'm so happy about this new location in our neighborhood. I used to have to drive to south Scottsdale to get my fix! The best part, they have a drive thru! Yep, fast, healthy food and you don't even have to get out of your car. My kinda place. See you again soon, D'lite!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Breakfast buzz is my jam! It is delicious, not sure how healthy it is, but I don't care... I crave it! And the turkey club or California breakfast club...sooo good! Always fast, and if they're too busy (line of cars in drive thru) they come out and take your order and bring it to you..which is 5 stars in my book, have an infant who has a love/hate relationship with car rides and you never know what you're gonna get. Always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! Its like the Cheer's Bar for college and adults who like to be healthy or even just want an awesome place to go to.  But the best thing that you can do for yourself is to get the Breakfast Buzz!  Its the perfect mixture of chocolate, espresso, banana and milk. I can't get enough of this!  The food is pretty awesome and so is the teas but seriously get the Breakfast Buzz anytime that they're open!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love.   For starters, I can get a green iced tea the size of my head. They have a drive-thru AND it's a healthy drive-thru. Not to mention they have the best tuna sandwich I've ever had.   I probably eat here once a week. It is my dream to one day try everything on the menu. Unfortunately, I can't stop eating that damn tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, great service, highly recommend the California club breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is great! I came 2 days in a row for the low carb breakfast. Fresh ingredients that taste great and are at a pretty low price, that's hard to beat. I wish there was one of these back home!! (Washington DC, hint hint) And it has a drive-through!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place to get healthy food on the go, then this is it. Every time I come here, the staff has been friendly and helpful. They also do a great job at getting your food to you in a timely manner.  The menu has a good variety of items, some even being vegetarian. I love ordering the California Club, which has great flavor and is very filling. Sometimes I am able to save the second half of the sandwich and get two meals out of it. I also recently started getting the Breakfast Buzz which is great to have after a workout. It has a peanut buttery flavor and is packed with vitamins, protein, and even espresso shots. I hope to try more items out because I don't think I'd be disappointed with anything they have to offer.  If you haven't already, I suggest coming to D'Lite. It's great quality food for a good price."}
{"text":"Great food & price. Organic and responsibly owned. Because I'm a fat girl at heart, my only gripe was the size of the food. Otherwise everything was perfect. I gave this place 4 stars  because of their parking situation. Totally inconvenient with their parking spots and at times lack thereof.  TIP: frittata is amazing. Definitely must have. Coffee is great too.  Try to bike there or don't bring a car. Even the drive thru is a nuisance with the traffic their parking lot creates."}
{"text":"Mayonaise makes me gag. I don't care how you prepare it, mix it, twist it, shout it...it grosses me out so bad. people who like/love/don't mind mayo always say things to me like 'try this potato salad, you can't even taste the mayo' and you know what? they are always lying.   anyway, i ordered the turkey club and asked them to hold the honey mustard spread. thankfully there wasn't any mayo so i didn't have to ask them to hold that either. this sandwich has a ton of my faves: tomato, turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado. scrumptious ingredients.   as soon as it's in my car, i can smell mayonaise. i think to myself 'oh, you're crazy, it's your immagination- the description said nothing about mayo'   well i am crazy, but my nose was right. mayo. on. my. sandwich.   usually i wouldn't flip out but my large sexy dirty chai and sandwich cost me $15. the drink alone was worth the $4 something dollars for several reasons, but the sandwich was gross and totally over priced. the bacon was pretty bad, and i ended up taking off most of the ingredients bc it wasn't very good. i was able to wipe off most of the mayo from the turkey and avocado so i ate that.  i was just so, so sad.   the customer service is great, the sexy dirty chai is great but the food i will not eat again."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Breakfast Buzz..more like addicted and I get with Almond Milk so an Almond Buzz!! This location (Tempe) seems to be way faster and has a much easier parking lot to navigate! Only negative is that is a little pricey but expected for healthy food options!"}
{"text":"Had the Green Lemonade and California Club and the lady friend had some oatmeal and coffee.  The lady friend loved the oatmeal and liked that she got to choose her milk. The California Club was amazing and if you don't try the green lemonade there is something wrong with you.   Service was awesome and quick.  Real nice soothing atmosphere as we sat by the black leather chairs by the tv.  Will be back 100 times more"}
{"text":"D'Liteful (*ducks tomato*)!  The small but mighty breakfast and lunch drive thru (formally known as D'Lish) has been a faint curiosity for me since I first drove past what looked like a line of about 10 cars eager to get their fix at this place.  I can't say with any credibility whether that is a normal crowd.  But having seen similar lines for drive thru's like In & Out Burger and Dutch Bros Coffee, I figured there'd had to be something behind the long lines.  So around 7:30am on a Sunday it was off to D'Lite's flagship location in South Scottsdale for breakfast.  Surprisingly upon my arrival there were only a pair of cars in front of me.  Additionally I saw that there was the option to park and dine in rather than go the drive thru route.  So dine in I did.  The space is fairly small with seating for maybe 20 inside and another 10 outside.  Parking is also limited with space for maybe 6-8 cars so depending on your arrival time dining in may simply not be practical, but the drive thru line was moving at a pretty decent clip regardless.  For dining in just order at the register, pick a seat inside or out and the good stuff is brought right out to you.  As this was my first go around here, I had done a little bit of research in advance and saw two particular items that were helpfully highlighted as \"signature\" items on the menu.  Seems like a good place to start.  So for my drink, I went with their Breakfast Buzz shake.  A 24 oz mix of nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate syrup, espresso, whey protein, and other vitamins all blended together with ice.  To be clear, I'm not a coffee drinker so the espresso aspect gave me a little trepidation, but honestly I didn't pick up any real coffee texture with this drink.  The two most dominant flavors were the chocolate and peanut butter.  The shake basically tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup in liquid form (which is just fine by me).  For my breakfast dish, I also went \"signature\" and chose their California Club sandwich.  Egg, bacon, turkey, tomato, avocado, pepper jack cheese, cream cheese & pesto on toasted artisan bread.  Pretty decent sandwich and a just right portion, though I'll admit the tomato flavor might've been a little too dominant here.  Would've preferred a little more emphasis on the turkey and bacon and I didn't pick up hardly any of the pesto or cream cheese flavoring.  That said I liked the portion of avocado and the egg was also emphasized just the right amount.  Total cost for the shake and the sandwich including tax came to $15.  Both items came out within 2 minutes and it seemed like the D'Lite staff paid just as much attention to their dine in customers as their drive thru ones so both dining options are equally viable.  In addition to their flagship spot in South Scottsdale, they also have a location in North Scottsdale and in Tempe.  Overall I was pretty satisfied with my first breakfast outing here.  It wasn't perfect, but it was enjoyable, affordable, and efficient.  I would certainly come back for breakfast and will likely try their lunch menu at some point (rumor has it their house style protein burgers are popular).  D'Lite yourself in d'licious d'lectable goodness.  Sorry, I'll see myself out now."}
{"text":"A sad experience overall. I love their other locations, but this one seems neglected and frankly pretty dirty. All three locations are overpriced, but I feel like that's to be expected with trendy health food.  The California club was burnt but still tasty.   I brought my boyfriend and he ordered the \"burger\".  While I should have expected it; we were a little surprised to find out it was a black bean burger rather than meat.  We felt a little deceived especially considering the $9 price.    Looking more closely at the menu it does say what it's made of in the fine print at the top, but if you're just looking at the topping options it is easy to miss.  I do love their breakfast buzz and usually the California club is on point so I'll still go to their other locations, but this location is sad in comparison."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Everywhere we went was closed today (Monday) even though they showed it on Yelp. So instead if driving to the next closed location we decided to give this place a try. I highly recommend the cold brew expresso. Possibly the best cold brew that I have had. The are full menu all day. I enjoyed the Southwest Rice Bowl and my wife cleaned her plate, the Low Carb Breakfast."}
{"text":"My office is in Old Town Scottsdale so I have a lot of options for lunch. This little place is by far my favorite! My \"usual order\" is the \"Man Salad\" which is just amazing- lots of protein and good fats to keep you full all afternoon!  They are always so friendly EVEN when they're busy. The thing I like most, however, is simply how consistent they are. The salad is the same every time, their service is excellent every time, and they are as fast as possible every time. You see them hustling to get orders done as quickly as they can. The place is really just wonderful- keep doing what you're doing guys!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday morning at 9am... I have been a fan of D*lish since they opened doors and the owner operated it. Well, it's been a while since I have visited because I have a three year old, so drive-thru's are always the better option for me to grab a drink and a bite to eat. We are always baffled that people will sit in the drive thru line which sometimes starts on Scottsdale road.  Today, I had time to wait as I needed to put my makeup on anyways. I look at the time so I could anticipate s possible future trip and what do you know, i had my breakfast sandwich and large green tea in hand in 6 minutes. I love it and am so proud that the local place can beat McDonald's across the street in a timed busy drive-thru race. The Cali breakfast sandwich was better than I remembered. I will never be afraid of their long drive-thru line again."}
{"text":"I love this place so I brought some girlfriends here the other day and they loved it too! We ordered the hummus plate (with no feta) to start which was a great idea of course! For myself I ordered the humanitarian with the broccoli side (no feta) and it was delicious! My friend and the cashier recommended it to me and I was not let down! The cashier was also super nice and awesome! I didn't get her name but props to her for dealing with us without complaints! 10/10"}
{"text":"My mom and I were looking for a good place to eat yesterday and we thought we'd try this cute little spot that seemed to be full of people as we drove down Scottsdale Rd.  And yes, when we arrived inside the cafe, it was booming with young, fitness going clientele. Nice. No limping people here.  My mom ordered the low carb breakfast which she seemed to love that included an egg with cheese covered in a pesto sauce over a bed of greens. It also included a hash brown patty.   I ordered the humanitarian wrap, which consisted of a tomato wrapper with an assortment of veggies including zucchini, yellow peppers, broccoli, tomato, quinoa and hummus. So good. Right up our alley.   We loved the food there but I think what we loved most was the staff member who pulled a table for us because he saw that we were eating our food without one. The place was really small and there were tables outside but it was hot as shit so my mom decided she wanted to sit inside even if we didn't have a table.   There was a large group of people next to us still chatting away after they had finished their food, so the staff member just kindly grabbed one of their tables for us, letting them know that we needed it to eat. That was awesome. Those people were totally oblivious to the two ladies sitting right next to them eating food on their laps, like that's something we would have chosen to do even if there were available tables.  Anyway, lovely place. Wide variety of great healthy food. Young crowd mostly. Tiny location. Great service. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch ever. The staff are always so sweet and everytime i go, my food comes out so fast and is always correct. It is very clean inside as well. The manager always stops by the table and makes sure everything is tasting well. I have also gone through the drive through three times, and each time it has not been more than five minutes for my food which is really impressive. Definitely my go to place for something quick, cheap, and healthy."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Scottsdale, I discovered this place and ordered the California Club based on other Yelp reviews. To this day, I still crave the sandwich and have even tried to re-create this deliciousness at home (... just not the same)!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Customer Service, Timing, and pricing could be improved. Don't go if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"How do I drive past this place every day and never stop?  Now that I've tried it... I won't make that mistake again!  D'lic has a great menu of fresh breakfast items including several vegetarian and gluten free selections.  Good bye starbucks, I found my new favorite coffee,  I'm so hooked!  Just beware the drive-thru is not super fast because all the food and drinks are made to order, but if you plan for a 10-15 minute wait you'll be fine.  The food is not cheap, but reasonable for fresh ingredients cooked to order.  Definitely give this place a try, great hang over cure after a nice out in OT!"}
{"text":"Ok..sooo I've fallen in love with this really amazing place called D'lite! I had the best breakfast sandwich called California Club.. It's got eggs, bacon, basil pesto, avacado, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese and cream cheese on a bialy bagel.   Great service too! I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"You can come for the food and drinks, or, you can come to people watch.  Seriously. Wake up in a Saturday/Sunday morning with nothing to do? Stop by D-lish, get a drink and enjoy the view. Soon enough, you'll see a stead flow of hipsters, Scottsdale party-goers in their walk-of-shame outfits and sorority girls in their Sunday best. Its absolutely stunning to see so many accidentally-overdressed people coming to a very very casual breakfast spot. And hey, most of them are pretty attractive- so its not like its a bad sight to see.  Customers aside, D'lish is an extremely popular spot for obvious reasons. Their breakfast items are a comforting deviation from your typical eggs Benedict, pancake stacks and omelettes, even tho they do have these components in one way or another.  For example, instead of your scramble eggs and bread, you can get the egg fritata on toast served with bacon and a pour of a smoky chipotle sauce. If you want something easier to eat or even \"on the go\", their club sandwich with egg is filling, hangover cure-tastic and pretty tasty. My one advice is to not get the veggie sandwich- its mostly green leaves and doesn't have the flavor and heartiness that we all need at 11am on a Saturday.  For drinks, I can't not order the orangina. It is extremely refreshing, not too sweet and gives me tons of energy (and Vitamin C). If you want to bulk up, their breakfast smoothie (with peanut butter, chocolate and other hearty items) is definitely a mouthful (dirty jokes aside!) but it is extremely popular for those peanut butter/chocolate smoothie lovers. Unfortunately, their iced chai is not worth ordering- it lacks flavor and its mostly just skim milk. :(  Pay at the counter and wait to get served at the table. Space is extremely limited, but luckily, many people chose the drive-through option so it is not too hard to get a table at prime time.  Hope to see your hungover asses there soon, if I haven't already...."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! The food is great, the service even better! Everyone is so friendly here. It is a great place to hang out as the dining room is one of the coolest I have seen. I will be back, probably way too often!"}
{"text":"I want to thank the owners for a nice message and apology. I recently gave D'Lite another try (anonymously) and it was very much improved from my last visit. Everyone was friendly and they do what they can to keep the line of cars moving by taking your order before you get to the window."}
{"text":"Even tho this place has a drive thru I can see why this place is so popular. They have many items to choose from for breakfast or lunch!  They even have protein shakes and smoothies.  I ended up trying the croissant sandwich along with a soy caramel latte.  Both were perfectly created and made my Taste buds sing.  I know a breakfast sandwich doesn't seem like a complicated item to make but this was by far the best I've ever had.  Their egg was perfectly cooked where the yolk was not overly done and wasn't too runny either.  You can either go thru the drive thru or come inside and order and sit down and have the food come to you!  It's not very spacious inside..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong, really. AZ burro and an iced green tea is my ultimate comfort meal. Everyone who works here is so friendly, perfect way to start my day!"}
{"text":"This place really delivers on their promise...Good food fast - but not \"fast food!\" I had the house style frittata and it was d'lish.   The staff was friendly, the place was clean and the ambiance was irie! I lived in Scottsdale for a few years and wish this place was around when I lived here. Enjoy a good meal and know that your pocket, your body (and the earth - they recycle and buy local) will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I got off my flight and came straight to D lite  on a recommendation from a friend. I got the black bean burger and pomegranate tea. It definitely hit the spot . So good I didn't have time to take a photo lOl.... It's healthy, clean and the service is efficient .I would def come back again and recommend it to anyone who is hungry and on the go."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Yes the lines can be long at times, but the staff goes above and beyond to take your order. The staff have always been friendly and every one seems to really enjoy working there. My drink of choice is the \"breakfast buzz\" hits the spot every time. I am looking forward to going there tomorrow to get my buzz on!"}
{"text":"I frequently eat at both the old town and Shea locations. The food is flavorful, well priced and mostly healthy. I always enjoy quick service. However, today, I had the worst experience there. The server could not get my order right at the drive through window. Ok, no big deal. Then it gets handed to me without my drink. Ok, no big deal. Then I get handed the incorrect drink. I politely mention this and the man helping me rudely tells me \"nope, that is what you ordered and what you are going to get. I heard you on my headset\". Ridiculous. I am really upset to be treated in such a manner. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Always satisfied. Healthy food on the go is the best to me. This was one of my goto places in college. Now being done with college for some years now , I work back in the area and I'm so happy literally just because I can go here for breakfast and now lunch again !!   I've tried bagels- I get them toasted and I love the fact that they add the cream cheese on for me!! That's such a sweet touch!  The California club breakfast sandwich is very very good, although I could probably eat two because I'm hunger again soon after it's very tasting and I like the make up of the sandwhich.  And the Breakfast buzz shake is great. I was hesitant at first because of the pb - but they allow substitutions and have the vegan buzz too! This one is a must try!     They are opening up  a new location near my place in Phoenix and I couldn't be more excited!!!"}
{"text":"For anyone who wants a quick and healthy meal to go, d'lish is the place to go. The california club is one of my favorites along with many more items on the menu. The service is always positive and quick. WIth its small interior, it makes for quick and easy service. The most popular item on the menu is the Breakfast Buzz which is a shake with bananas, vitamin, coffee, peanut butter and milk. If you want something healthy and fast to eat, the buzz is the way to go."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Ordered the early bird burger, bagel, orange juice and kombucha tea. I must say we were impressed by the burger and ingredients. Good place to have veggie food."}
{"text":"They have HANDS DOWN the best tuna salad sandwich I've had in The Valley. And also, because they understand that tuna sandwiches are delicious both cold and hot, I am now giving a hard pass on any tuna sandwich unless it's from D'lite. I eat fish, but can't stomach much else in the meat department and their southwestern bowl (without chicken) is a solid choice as well. I'm truly \"living my best life\" when I'm eating their tuna salad (good for those who are also a big dill like myself ) Thank you D'lite, what a great start to my culinary adventures this year"}
{"text":"The California Club is amazing!!!! Staff is always upbeat and super friendly, this is a great place to eat healthy."}
{"text":"I needed some coffee today... so I rolled through the drive through and ordered my usual triple shot cappuccino with honey.   They do a great job here and I will definitely be back.  The coffee here rivals my usual spot copper star coffee.  The drive through is awesome... I love not having to get out of my car:)."}
{"text":"Great emloyees and the blended BUZZ is the BOMB love it and the breakfast croissant is delicious  The only thing i would ask to change is to make the hours go longer i don't get out of work till 6:00 so i can only get me a Buzz on the weekends but still  Gve it a try this place is wonderful"}
{"text":"This establishment was ok at best. The food selection wasn't inventive, and the time it took to receive a simple bagel sandwich was just under 10 minutes. The waiter was too busy flirting with my friend to carry out his job."}
{"text":"What a great alternative to McDonalds!  Great service, pleasing ambiance, and especially......the tasty & well prepared fresh food!  Our favorite: California Club!   Silver Palette Ladies Lunching Club"}
{"text":"Crowded space but you can def get something healthy to go.  Tried their signature hummus wrap and California breakfast sandwich.  Very tasty.  The portions aren't huge but healthy.    Glad to have healthier joints in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  This is one of the best places in the Scottsdale/Tempe area to go for a filling, delicious, healthy meal.  I love, love, love their soups.  Their sandwiches and \"burgers\" are pretty tasty too.  The only thing I could ask for is that they start offering at least one gluten free bread option, like Chompies's gluten free rolls (so far the best gluten free bread option I have had), so that individuals with gluten sensitivity can enjoy their sandwiches and burgers."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for breakfast and really enjoyed D'lish.  We ordered their drip coffee and some bagels and found everything tasty.  The coffee was strong and HOT! If water boils at 212°F, then D'lish serves it at 210°F LOL  What was great about it?  It wasn't over roasted and burnt like the Green Mermaid.  Actually the three of us enjoyed our conversation waiting for it to cool.  The bagels were another surprise.  Given the small space of D'lish's building, I would love to find out where the get them.  My suspicion would be NY Bagel on Scottsdale Road, up near Shea Blvd.  But no matter, they were very good and hit the spot.  We'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"The 'Man' Salad!! Yum!! Greens, small scoop of tuna salad, chicken breast, feta, bacon, tomato, avocado. Oh, did I mention bacon?! All super fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have only had their breakfast buzzes but just that alone makes me wish I still lived in Tempe so I could go more often. The lines can be a bit long but health orientated restaurants that also offer a drive thru are pretty hard to find."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place to eat in Scottsdale.  You can't go wrong with the AZ burro or California Club. Both are so good, I haven't even thought about trying anything new, although I soon will.  The green lemonade is the perfect (healthy)  drink to keep you feeling cool, and relaxed on a warm summer day."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I really like their veggie burrito. It's a great mix of ingredients and the salsa adds good flavor. I've recently become quite the fan of their lattes as well."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! This is such a good place to get a breakfast sandwich in the morning. I always get the California club, the best thing on the menu. It's on soft ciabatta bread, with perfectly cooked eggs, bacon, turkey, cream cheese, tomato, avocado, and the best part......PESTO! I would highly recommend this place. My friends enjoy their style of oatmeal as well as the black bean burger. It's great quality and the never let me down. The one thing that kind if sucks is their location. It's very small and the drive thru sometimes goes into the street. Not good! And parking is a bitch too. There's hardly any and it is just a very tight squeeze to get in. But the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing- I see a lot of cars here regularly so I dropped by to get lunch today. I ordered the southwest bowl, which consisted of a piece of broccoli and 4 pieces of chicken over rice. The sauce or soup in the bowl seemed to be thickened with something, I'm not sure how healthy it might have actually been. For about $10 I would have expected higher quality."}
{"text":"Very cool little spot. Love the concept of healthy fast food and reducing the impact on the environment. Awesome coffee. Californian club sandwich is a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for breakfast three times while visiting family. My favorite is the oatmeal - which is actually quinoa. It's not too sweet. has yummy fresh fruits and stemmed milk. Their bialy sandwiches and breakfast burritos are also very good. Fresh ingredients makes the difference. The portion sizes are generous too."}
{"text":"Mickey, the GM there, is awesome.  I witnessed him go around to people at the restaurant, building rapport with them, getting to know them, caring about the people.   The food here is awesome, I've been alot to the other locations and it's just as good (which is the key for a franchise).   Breakfast buzz is the best iced drink in town, bar none.  I will spend way too much money at this establishment over the next few years, but I'm totally good with that."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret. I ordered a breakfast club which was phenomenal and a breakfast buzz. I would highly recommend both. Their breakfast buzz is out of this world."}
{"text":"Refreshing and delicious!!  Hummus platter is my go to dish and this place did not disappoint.  Club sandwich split with a friend was the perfect size to hold us over after a long hike    Will return"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and finally I have the same experience as others. To be fair, I've only had the signature Breakfast Buzz smoothie and a breakfast burrito. The smoothie is flippin amazing. So good I've gone back several days in a row to get it and this place is a bit out of the way for me. The burrito was just ok. A bit expensive (to me) for the size and fillings, plus it seemed a bit gummy to me. Not sure if that was the tortilla or the cheese, but to be honest I've had much better breakfast burritos.  The interior is super cute and very well done, they even have a drive thru. How convenient! The staff have also been very friendly and helpful. One day I will venture out and try out some of the other food they have and report back. So for now it is just one star shy of a full 5 because of the gummy burrito, but really above par on all other areas!"}
{"text":"great low key breakfast, friendly staff. yummy quinoa granola and breakie burrito ($4.75)."}
{"text":"I relocated from Phoenix to Tempe almost two years ago and D'Lish/D'Lite quickly became my coffee spot away from home. Consistently the most friendly staff who remembered my name and some of the best coffee I've had in the Valley. Usually I would just drink cold coffee black but sometimes I would go with the Breakfast Buzz for a change and absolutely loved it! The food is also 'd'lish'. My favorite is the toast with sausage, egg and hashbrowns with chipotle aioli.   Thank you especially to Shelby and Leonard for always being so cool and willing to chat when they're not incredibly busy.  Note, they are a popular spot and can get busy on Saturday mornings. There is additional parking down the side street. Great place to work during the week and people watch on the weekends. Ideal for coffee, food and conversation."}
{"text":"So thankful my girlfriend wanted to try this place out! I had no idea it was even here!!!! I had the California Club and it was AMAZE-balls!!!! Oh and a cappuccino. They were so fast and really everything was delicious. I will definitely back again!"}
{"text":"veggie breakfast burrito and croissant sandwich were both excellent.  +1 service, +1 drive thru, +1 prices"}
{"text":"Vegan Buzz. That is all. Wait. Also, try not to get killed when it's busy and fools in the drive through are backed up into the busy Scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 5 stars as to me, it is a pioneer of the way fast food should be in this day and age. My wife and I ordered one item off the breakfast menu, a chicken sausage frittata, the kitchen sink salad and a veggie wrap. We finished up with a cafe mocha and chocolate, peanut, banana smoothie (yum!) The food was very good and came out pretty quickly. Everything was just fresh and they had a lot of healthy, vegetarian choices. The place is a little small inside but there is a nice size outdoor patio, they also have a drive through which is a convenient service. In a world dominated by Mcdonalds and other fast food establishments, finally, we have a healthy, convenient alternative!  I hope this trend continues and more of these type of places start popping up all over the place. Way to go D'lish, you really raised the bar on fast food for healthy minded people."}
{"text":"Food is amazing....fresh ingredients, healthy options, and best of all a drive-thru. Love the new location! Quick, easy, and tastes great, can't ask for more"}
{"text":"I had always heard this place was amazing, but never checked it out until a little over a month ago.  We stopped in for lunch and brought our dog to eat out on the patio.  We enjoyed the baja chicken soup, a southwest chicken bowl, a raspberry italian soda, a lemonade and a dog bowl...everyone was happy and thoroughly enjoyed their lunch!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last week on my day off before heading to yoga.  I enjoyed an everything bagel with cream cheese and an Orange Glorious - wow so tasty!  I have been craving the Orange Glorious ever since trying it...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and the oatmeal is yum. Today I'm doing lunch. Man salad, sure to be satisfied as usual."}
{"text":"Amazing! My wife and I were blown away at the incredible taste of the food. We stopped in for breakfast. This is healthy food done right. I recommend this place to anyone who loves good food."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten there is awesome! The humanitarian wrap is my favorite! We call in take out at least once a week at work and the food always consistent and prepared quick! The drive thru is very convenient also.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I usually love it here but today they barely put any cream cheese on my bagels. I didn't spend 9$ on 3 bagels with no cream cheese."}
{"text":"Taken in the context of the drive thru/fast casual there wasn't much to say about the decor of the South Scottsdale location.  However, the drive thru line was out to the street if that tells you anything.  I chose the Humanitarian Chix Supreme and the attendant put it in immediately.  Wasn't waiting too long before I got my wrap and headed to the house.  Although I'm not foreign to broccoli in a wrap/burrito I was a bit surprised.  The coupling of cold flavors was pretty tasty.  As far as healthy on the go, D'lite could be the spot.  The location looked small so I don't see myself doing walk-up service at this location."}
{"text":"Yes, please! The California Club is fantastic! This sandwich will fill you up and has a fantastic flavor. To be honest, I haven't tried anything else on the menu because the California Club is so good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Locally grown and damn tasty. Walking distance from airport hotels and craft coffee and teas. Do it!!! They have this thing called a \"man salad\".. Im a man and dont eat salad unless its chicken or tuna, I ate this....still a man!  Do it!!!!!"}
{"text":"had the kitchen sink salad - was expecting some serious ingredients piled on top of each other....thats not what I got. It was measly ingredients, fake chicken that looked pressed together and had no flavor. And it was small...for the price - this place is NOT worth going to. I have had better salads for less other places. Not impressed at all - a shame - the menu looks so good and I wanted to try other things - but if you can't get a salad right and use awesome ingredients - no thanks I wont return."}
{"text":"This place is so delish! The breakfast buzz is a genius idea to get you up in the morning.   Protein, almond milk, vitamins, banana, chocolate, peanut butter, and an espresso shot.  This place offers fast service, amazing quality and service! Thank you !"}
{"text":"My wife and I came across D'lish on Yelp and with all the great reviews went for breakfast.  WOW!  First of all, small place and not one you would necessarily notice driving by.  It's in a small building, like an old fast food restaurant, complete with a drive thru.  We knew we would be OK when the drive thru line was backed up 5 cars deep into the street.  That kind of traffic means that somethings going way right here.  My wife had the the club sandwich and I had the low carb breakfast.  Both of us were blown away with how good everything was.  The menu has a lot of interesting items.  Ones we are going to try now and replicate at home.  If you are looking for an overpriced and fancy place, this is not the place for you.  If you want honest, excellent food and attention to the quality and makeup of the food, then don't miss D'lish."}
{"text":"I think this place is really overrated, while I found very cool to have a healthy choice on the go without leave the car, the space for the drive thru is shared with the parking lot, so it's crowded, I felt anxiety just to see the cars behind me and at my side parking or coming out from their spot, besides that the service is very slow not like as a fast food drive thru... I easily spent like 15 minutes on the cars line and waiting...an eternity for me considering this is a drive thru... Now the other costumers were also anxious they started to honk their claxon and well that's not nice neither... The prices are high for the quality and amount of food that you get. And the food is not really healthy at all! I will not come back and I will not recommend to anyone I care, so much trouble just for the wait to open my bag at home and find it's not at i was expecting from a healthy salad spot, no thanks!  By the way there's another salad drive thru a couple of blocks going to south I haven't tried but I will give them a visit to try them."}
{"text":"I really liked our stop at D'lish. It was first place we visited when we stepped off the plane for Spring Training, and just the breakfast I had been wanting since 3:30 AM. Thanks to all the great Yelpers in Scottsdale, we decided quickly on D'lish, and found it to be up to all the hype. The food is delicious, healthy, and fast, and we were not at all disappointed. The inside is small, but we had a great spot on the outside. As someone who loves to eat on the healthy side, this was the perfect stop to get us geared up for a weekend of baseball."}
{"text":"First time at this location...Staff was super friendly and overall service was excellent in the drive thru. I got the Southwest Rice Bowl and It was meh, little more soupy than I imagined. I've had a sandwich here before and remember it being really tasty. So wraps/sandwiches may be the way to go! Also, they gave my dog Charlee a treat, so she's a fan!. Always nice to have healthier options in the neighborhood! We'll be back to try some other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I read all the great reviews and decided to give this place a try. The workers were very nice, however the place is a dive. Lots of flies, dingy, very loud rock music playing inside(probably to drown out all the heavy traffic noise outside) We got a breakfast club and a lunch club sandwich. The egg sandwich had lots of mayo on it, which we thought odd. We had to leave before we were finished due to the bugs. About an hour after we got home, we both had upset stomachs. If you're a fan of loud dingy places with lots of flies served up on the side, this is for you."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out today. I heard so much about it on the radio. Especially about the breakfast buzz drink so I had to stop by and see what the buzz was about. See what I did there? :) I got the California club breakfast sandwich and the breakfast buzz drink and OMG that drink was AMAZING! The food was freakin' delicious too. I was not disappointed. The place lived up to the radio hype. Nice to have a healthy alternative to fast food. Just wish one was closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"The thing I love about this place is that its simple. Sandwiches, salads, soups. Breakfast and Lunch. There menu is specific.... what comes on the meal and what health benefits (if any). They do not serve soda. Tea, lemonade and coffee. Staff was knowledgeable and quick. No complaints."}
{"text":"California club, all the way, I love their breakfast sandwiches. They're so tasty, the breakfast buzz is also worth mentioning, I don't really dig on the quinoa oatmeal, so pass on that and stick with the sandwiches. They also have kombucha sometimes, which I dig in the morning, because I'm a masochist with vinegar tasting beverages, per my boyfriend at least. Is a little spendy though."}
{"text":"Best tuna sandwiches on the planet.  And truly top-notch menu, full of vegetarian choices, (and many that include include meat if you are into that).  Drive through takes a while sometimes, but it is well worth it. We need more healthy fast food places like this. Everything I have ever had at D'lish is amazing, and it is fresh and healthy!  One of my favorite places for sure, but I wish they didn't close quite as early, I could eat there any time of day. D'lish needs to be nation wide.  Also, they a few menu options for dogs, which obviously just makes me love them even more.  Heidi, my german shepherd rescue and official canine foodie, says she would prefer that the doggie options had a little more meat to go along with all the rice, but at the end of the day she doesn't mind eating around the rice that she considers bland on its own.  \"There is no whining when I'm wine-ing, if my dog is with me dining.\"  -Dog Mom Dining"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way to work and ordered a protein breakfast smoothie, two ice teas, and their oatmeal. The ice tea is always great, and I enjoyed my smoothie - but the oatmeal... terrible! It appeared to be warm milk with some grains, apples and bananas. I thought they forgot the oatmeal! My co worker (whom I bought it for) and I were very confused. I glanced at the menu before I wrote the review and realized that no, they didn't forget it, there is no actual oatmeal in the oatmeal. They call it \"oatmeal our way\" and list the ingredients as quinoa, maple drizzle, fruit, granola and steamed milk. OK maybe my fault for not realizing it didn't list oatmeal as an ingredient but seriously.. Don't call it OATMEAL. For $6.00 I was very disappointed. I don't know anyone that would enjoy it. It was a 20oz cup filled with 80% milk and some fruit and the quinoa. I gave 3 stars because usually their food is good, overpriced, but good. But seriously, think about offering a disclaimer or something."}
{"text":"So delicious, I would go there every morning if it was closer to me.  My Favs: Breakfast Buzz, Chai Tea Latte, Breakfast burro, my gosh I don't think it is possible to go wrong here. Everyone I have shared D'lish with ends up addicted."}
{"text":"Nice menu but drive through and parking are pain. Good price though. Patio seating and WiFi are plus!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had a breakfast burrito with black beans, mushrooms, eggs and cheese and fresh salsa on the side! I also had a prickly pear tea and a almond milk latte both were on point! The second time I dined in and had a big salad and a wrap that were also yummy! I love that they have a drive through. I wish they were open later in the day. For a quick healthy bite to eat I definitely recommend this place. My only negative would be one of the staff members she has been there both times I have been there, she mumbles and doesn't really smile.... if you don't like people, don't work in customer service! All the other staff was great! I can't fault them for one bad tomato!"}
{"text":"Over rated. Way too expensive, location SUCKS, and the employees nickel and dime you for every thing extra dressing, salsa or sweetener everything is gonna cost you. A salad runs about $10 with tax and then add all the extras. Too many other great options in the area to be nickel and dimed over condiments."}
{"text":"Hello friends... I have been searching this earth for the perfect blend of black tea my entire life.  It has taken decades to come up with what I truly  believe is unparalleled....until now! Decades of life have been wasted, as you can now easily find a better Iced Tea at this amazing little gem of a restaurant.  Tea is one thing, but we were absolutely floored by the great customer service especially from our fabulous host named Patty.  She welcomed us to lunch, we had a great time, and we can't wait to come back.  Cars line up around the block for food at this place, but I'll have a hard time not coming in to see Patty now.. oh yeah.. the Tuna sandwich was dank!"}
{"text":"I stop at D'lish almost every morning for a large coffee and a bagel.  The coffee is delicious and is great black.  To me the sign of a good coffee is one I can drink and enjoy without adding sugar or cream and this is it.  The D'veggie (sp?) bowl for lunch/dinner is so good I would eat it every day.  I did try their version of breakfast oatmeal the other week and it was phenomenally good.  I will definitely be having it again.  2010/10/06 - Went for lunch today with some coworkers and it was as good as always.  All of the inside tables were full, but it was cool enough to sit outside and the guys brought our food out to us.  One of my friends had the protein burger and said it was really good.  I once again had the D'Veggie bowl and really need to get something else, but it is SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some breakfast while traveling in Phoenix. I was looking for a place that would be on the healthier side and I want disappointed! This was a smaller place so I don't recommend staying with a large group but they make the food pretty quickly and the food was amazing. I had their signature California breakfast Wrap and every bite was delicious. Pretty affordable of a healthy breakfast wrap and a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the California club and AZ burro are popular and for good reason. I came on a weekday morning so it's not as busy as on the weekends. The building is very small and primarily a drive thru ordering system with about a dozen seats inside and another dozen outside. Not sure that I would wait in a line for 20 minutes for a burrito or sandwich but overall the food is excellent, healthy, and there's a good variety of hot and cold beverages."}
{"text":"Go here a few times a week for their healthy food and amazing Breakfast Buzz drink! The staff is always friendly and very quick with getting their customers served! If you have a chance to go to D'Lish, absolutely do it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff will return for sure when I get to town again"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast here this morning. I have long been a fan of the location on Scottsdale Road, but it is tiny and always kind of a cluster. This location has a much bigger, beautiful, modern, clean space. Had the California club egg sandwich. Soft ciabatta bread that held together well. Perfect balance of filling and bread. Very focused on local, fresh, organic ingredients. Very friendly staff. I will definitely be back for breakfast or lunch when I'm in this area."}
{"text":"Favorite bfast joint in Scottsdale hands down! Quick and healthy food. My favorite is the California Club. Their coffee is pretty good as well. Only negative is the location! There's always a line in the drive through out onto Scottsdale road and because of this you can never park in their lot.  But despite always being busy I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food. I'm sad I waited so long to try this place when I used to live just around the corner!"}
{"text":"Being a visitor to Arizona, this was a great local spot for breakfast.  Great coffee and natural food choices and very friendly service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything Ive ordered has been amazing food! The Man Salad is probably a top fav! I wish it was open for dinner, LOL"}
{"text":"Insane!!!! Please open a location in Cali!! We were in town for the weekend and went here two times! Amazing food super nice staff they help you a lot!! Keep jammin this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, this place is pretty good.  I have only gotten the humanitarian chicken pesto wrap since I've been coming here and it's pretty filling-and super healthy! It is a bit pricey- came to about almost $10 for the wrap, $13 with a drink. And I just had to tip $2 for the great service. But it is pretty tasty and healthy. This is my go to spot when I'm in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"Great little drive thru breakfast.  AZ burrito was excellent."}
{"text":"Baby breakfast buzz. That's pretty much my usual order at this point. You will recognize it is a lot of regulars at this point that know the menu and will wait in the line. It is worth it because the food is healthier and catered towards people on the go that don't want fast food..and the menu is also very vegetarian/vegan friendly. I enjoy Dlish and mostly everybody in Scottsdale knows about this place by now and if you don't then you're missing out. Five stars for friendly service and tasty meals."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"OMG\"!!!  The first thing I had here after a friend brought me for a quick breakfast was the California club.  It really was like a party in my mouth!  I'm not kidding.  Everything on the menu looks so good I can't wait to try it all.  I'm a little embarrassed to admit it but I have circled all the items that I really want to try on the menu and I'm going through them one by one (I'm a total list crosser-offer).  The last thing I tried there was \"oatmeal our way\". Which is actually not oatmeal at all, but SO incredible!"}
{"text":"D'Lite has a super healthy menu that really lends toward active lifestyles I love their breakfast buzz, can't get enough of them.  I usually order the vegan buzz with plant based protein.  They do an incredible job at putting a healthy spin on typical breakfast items like breakfast burritos and the oatmeal their way.  I've had several of their sandwiches and salads for lunch, all are filling and leave you feeling great.  Staff is very friendly and drive thru moves quik! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I moved from Scottsdale one year ago, and I can tell you that this is the place I miss the most.  Their food is fresh, healthy and served drive-thru - nothing better.  Literally the perfect start to a Saturday / Sunday morning.  My favorites are the breakfast buzz and California Club. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Their AZ burrito was great. The flavor journey ended way too soon though. The portion size was disappointing, very small. The salsa included was not very authentic, not good. Service was mediocre, lacking professionalism, what do you expect near ASU though? I would probably not go back again as it was also expensive! :/"}
{"text":"Always consistently great for me... I love the low carb salad... I see a lot of ppl are upset with the long time for the drive through.  The secret is to park at super burrito and order or dine inside..  or even better call in your order ahead of time!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed! I was looking forward to trying D'lite and ended up having order envy of literally every person around me. When my d'veggie bowl came out I was honestly shocked at how small and unsubstantial it was. I think I finished it in 6 bites and they forgot the bagel chips which really would have helped the situation. At $10 I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone who is actually hungry. Also, they kids' meal options are anemic. My daughter's $5 grilled cheese was very lonely. At that price point kids' options usually come with a vegetable or fruit on the side and a beverage. Not here - just a sandwich all by itself on a plate. The smoothies, burritos and salads around me looked worth returning for at some point but I won't be hurrying back to try them."}
{"text":"So I discovered D'lish today during my Friday lunch excursion and i have to say I'm quite delighted to have stumbled upon the place. I work close by and have always struggled with my local occupational coffee situation. Ya see... I love to put my money in locally owned and operated businesses, but the cafe at my work location serves horrible coffee so I have been wearing a disguise and hitting the Starbucks drive through to make it through some work days. until today.... D'lish has marvelous fair trade locally roasted espresso that is prepared to the coffee connoisseurs delight.   For lunch I had the hummus plate with chicken and the creamy tomato basil soup. The hummus plate was just OK (reason why the 5th star wasn't added to this review). The hummus was a little bland and the chicken was soggy as if it had been precooked and thawed. However, I really like how they serve veggies with their hummus plate and not just pita. The creamy tomato basil soup, on the other hand, was superb or shall i say D'lish.   The atmosphere is relaxing, cozy and unique with a bit of urban flair. I'll have to bring my laptop next time and relish the ambiance while I get some work done.  I'm so excited that I found good quality locally roasted coffee... I will definitely be back and I'm looking forward to giving a try to the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've only ordered one thing on the menu...and that's the House Style frittata. It's amazing. That's why I kept ordering it. I've also had the Breakfast Buzz shake minus the peanut butter and that was also great.   One thing that's weird about the drive thru is that they walk up to you and ask what you want. Like, before you've seen a menu. Idk what i want yet dude ! If you ask, they give you a menu, but I just think that that's weird. There's probably a small percentage of people who know what they want before looking at a menu. So give me one first, then ask later...anyway not a big deal."}
{"text":"Been here several times with the drive thru and eating inside.  Service is good but the food Quality has gone downhill.  So disappointing that the Frittata was not fresh... Nuked eggs were not good.  Reheated frittata was overdone."}
{"text":"Liked it. Better than expected. The food is super fresh, varied, and healthy. Not inexpensive, but not outrageous. Good choice for a fast, quality meal. P.S. It's not just takeout. The inside is relatively inviting..couches and everything."}
{"text":"Love this place, always satisfied. They're breakfast buzz smoothie is seriously addicting and they probably think I'm crazy because I'm there at least 4 times a week."}
{"text":"Awesome food and fast service! I had the California club, which was a jam-packed sandwich with lots of flavor - bacon, pesto, avocado, tomato, eggs - all with the freshest ingredients. My mom enjoyed the nuts and berries salad which she says was delightful and crisp. I can't say enough about 'The Buzz' either... a creative morning drink with peanut butter, espresso, banana and chocolate. I could have that every day and I wouldn't get sick of it. I wish I lived closer, this would easily become a favorite weekend restaurant, especially with the drive thru option! These people know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Favorite place!! everything is awesome! There green tea and breakfast buzz are the best."}
{"text":"My dad and I searched up and down for a good breakfast place and stumbled upon this gem. It was EXACTLY what we were looking for. Cool vibe, friendly staff, vegan options, free wifi, good food... Just excellent!"}
{"text":"Average food. Noisy inside. Not a lot of parking, actually horrible parking. I got caught in the drive thru trying to leave. It's like healthier fast food. I had the breakfast burro and my wife had the Cali club. Both were average to me."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot! Every time I go here I leave satisfied... I used to go here all the time when I worked at Skysong but now have moved up to DC Ranch area.   Not going to lie, I have driven all the way down to Old Town on several occasions just to get lunch here... Granted I am obsessive and like the place alot, but either way, great little spot that you might miss driving by it!  Here are why I don't give it 5-stars: --They need more hours, open later... I mean their location is out of the Old Town foot traffic, I get it, but still! --Need to get the Drive Through situation worked out a little better..."}
{"text":"I have dreamed of a place like this since I can remember.. \"Why isnt there a convenient drive-thru place with delicious food? The kind of place that caters to scenarios such as being hungover in your outfit from night before and desiring something so much more than your regular egg mcmuffin and hash brown.  I highly recommend the breakfast burrito/turkey sausage accompanied with green tea. . refreshing and sinfully D'lishous :)"}
{"text":"I really like their sandwiches (my favorite is the california club).  Can be quite busy in the morning and the drive-thru gets really crowded (we can't even access to the parking behind sometimes), but i guess that's a good sign, right?  Other than that, I would definitely recommend for those who like a healthy sandwich in the morning."}
{"text":"I am not sure about this place. I like it but my god was it dirty as hell! I am mean so freakin dirty I am not sure what the hell was going on. Trash cans over flowing with trash, trash all over the floor and under stuff, all the way into the Kitchen. It was terrible. I had the veggie wrap. It was OK. nothing special. My kids had turkey and chicken sandwiches which were ok. My wife had quinoa thingy which is just veggies and quinoa in a soup. It was good but clearly a pre made soup most. I am not sure I would go to this location again due to it being FILTHY! I don't care if they were slammed for lunch and in the weeds they should have cleaned up. They were all standing around not cleaning a damn thing. Not sure if I would give them a second chance...Coffee was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I love this place... I have been here for breakfast and lunch and have not been disappointed. I just moved here from San Diego and it's nice to finally find a place in Scottsdale with Healthy options, good prices and fast, friendly service!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to get a fast and healthy drive through breakfast or lunch!   The eggwhites veg burrito is outstanding.   The service is smart , quick and friendly.   This is my new go to place near work!"}
{"text":"EAT AT D'LISH!  Food is great. You can have a healthy breakfast/lunch or cure your hangover with fritatas and breakfast burritos. The coffee is the upper echelon as well.  The atmosphere is great - friendly, hip, personal - the likes of which i haven't seen since I left Manhattan (with the exception of a couple vacations to San Francisco and Amsterdam).  BIG PLUS: d'lish is staffed by pretty good looking people and the clientele is as friendly as they are.   STOP DRIVING UP AND DOWN SCOTTSDALE RD. WONDERING \"how that place d'lish is.\" I finally stopped in and have been back every Sat & Sun since."}
{"text":"I won a gift card and was excited to try this new place. On food alone, this place is a 5. We ordered the AZ burro and the California Club. Both were delicious, but the CC was the stand out! This place lost points on atmosphere. The parking lot was super tiny and with the drive thru, it made it difficult to get in and out. The inside was tiny and super loud so we ate outside. However the street traffic was almost as noisy since it's on busy Scottsdale Road. I will be back, but next time I'll just go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"I went to this small restaurant after my camel back hike.  The food is light, tasty, and cheap!  Easy go to spot for a smoothie, healthy wrap or salad.  I highly recommend this place if you want something that taste good and is healthy.  The drive through is a bit ridiculous, while I was sitting down I saw a few fights break out because of the long line that extends out to the street.  But it's not the restaurant's fault."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cali club is the best also the breakfast buzz! Customer service is always great! A little pricey but definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"Love their healthy menu options and hefty portions. I would recommend the California Club for breakfast or the Tuna Sandwich for lunch! They do a nice twist on all the entrees like adding pesto or honey sauce. Be sure you have plenty of time because they are always packed. If attempting the drive thru make sure you come at it from the South so you can get in line from the street. Customer service is great and will come out to your car to order to make the line move faster."}
{"text":"The California club is so yummy!! Thick cut bread, over medium eggs, avocado, pesto, bacon, tomato. So good...only thing they could do better is use better quality bacon. A couple of times, the bacon was super fatty, not crunchy. The dirty chai is amazing."}
{"text":"The California club and breakfast buzz are amazing! I wish they would have another location more north, although the drive and wait are worth it for this place!!  Has a drive-thru if you're grabbing something on the way to work!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The food is so fresh and tasty the guys that work there are truly very nice which is harder and harder to find these days.   I would definitely recommend this place to every."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummmm!!!! So hard to find quick n easy choices as a vegetarian. love their traditional burrito. my boyfriend loves their veggie burgers (not a vegetarian) so thats always a plus! i love this little place to start my day"}
{"text":"At first I was confused by D'lish, how can drive-thru be healthy? I walked in to meet a friend and fell in love with the small menu (Side note: I dislike big menus - they overwhelm my indecisive self)! How often can you go somewhere and get a dish made with quinoa, being that I am recovering vegetarian, I was super excited! Then he brought out this \"pasta\" dish and as the name states it was D'lish! The great thing about D'lish is that each dish is freshly made with locally grown produce. I've been there several times and everything I've had has been refreshingly healthy, balanced, and tastes great.   The owner keeps telling me that I need to come in and try breakfast but since I live in Gilbert I have yet been able to make it over. Maybe one of these Sundays, I'll stumble in my dancing heels from the night before to try their breakfast sandwich and the infamous \"Breakfast Buzz\" shake, which according to the owner is THE cure for a hangover.   P.S. The hype surrounding the Dirty Chai is well deserved because it is as fabulous as my new dancing heels!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was fantastic.  Nice inside, the front counter girl was more a brand ambassador than an employee.  Give that girl a raise or maybe I'll hire her.  Food was satisfying, filling yet light and delicious.  Girlfriend remarked that the coffee was awesome.  See you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and fresh. Can't go wrong with the breakfast buzz and Cali club!!! Wish they had a D'Lish up in the north Scottsdale area but for now I don't mind driving to south Scottsdale or Tempe!! Highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their Breakfast Buzz, hummus with chicken plate, broccoli salad and their veggie delight (I add turkey). So happy there is a drive thru that offers healthy food!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buzz shake. The best guilt free shake that I know of it's just about all protein. A great meal replacement. I'm sold love it. I've also gotten the veggie breakfast burrito. So good aswell."}
{"text":"The California Club was good but this is a drive through joint with a need for some customer service training. I couldn't even get in to park without being part of the drive through line. So instead of going on, I went though the drive through.  They took orders from the line \"portillos\" style which is fine, but when I got to the window a woman handed me the bag and walked away. She didn't give me utensils so I sat there waiting for her to return for several minutes. After about 3-5 minutes, I beeped my horn to request utensils..and still waited a few more minutes."}
{"text":"It was the afternoon so I said why not try a non breakfast sandwich, so i took a chance on the \"chicken panini\" (added avocado because as you know which you all should avocado is a gift from the gods) AND IT BLEW MY BRAINS!  I ate it so quick I couldn't take a picture or I would upload its deliciousness to it can stimulate your eyes as it did my stomach.  This place never disappoint's, EVER!"}
{"text":"First timer. It was okay, i ordered the breakfast club. I didn't have much time to look at the menu. Next time trying something else. Then ill decide if i like the place lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there today and loved it. I had the turkey club and she had the tuna sandwich. She had an ice tea and I had the kombucha tea. Sandwiches were good but what I'm more excited about is the kombucha tea. It's like a sour Belgian beer but it's a cold tea. Craziest beverage I've ever had, in a good way!  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz shake just may be the best shake I've ever had. The food is definitely a healthy alternative to other fast food joints and is still delicious at the same time. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to grab a quick meal and not suffer the feeling of fast food regret 15 mins after you have eaten."}
{"text":"I was happy to see another \"non-hookah\" related establishment go up in my neighborhood. I tried a crossaint breakfast sandwich and a GIANT green tea. Came out to $11. The tea was great. The $6 sandwich was smaller than my fist. I realize this is a \"health\" food place and that \"we use fresh produce whenever available\" but I left hungry. I hope they realize how tough the summer will be."}
{"text":"Kitchen sink salad is amazing! It comes with chewy, soft bagel \"chips\" on the side and the salad itself is a pretty decent portion of yummy quinoa, lettuce (arugula?), and lots of other goodies. You won't get bored with this salad, that's for sure. This salad has bagel chips in it, which I was skeptical of at first, but they came in a separate bag and were soft and chewy, just like a bagel should be!  I've tried a few bites of other items like the breakfast burrito and the club, both of which were tasty. I've been wanting to try the burgers since they sound so delicious, but they're always out of them, even before noon!   As for drinks, I've tried the soy chai, almond chai, and dirty soy chai. I've gotta say, don't mess with perfection-the soy chai is where it's at! Also, their lemonade is BOMB, and I hate lemonade usually. The girl behind the counter said it's not homemade but it's \"really expensive\" lemonade they get delivered, and I totally believe her.  Only complaints are the hours (they close so early!) and the parking situation, which totally sucks. Parking requires Austin-Powers style maneuvers going from reverse to drive back and forth, but its totally worth it. Part of this is because they have a DRIVE-THRU, which is awesome, but the line is sooooooo long (all the time!), so it's worth it to just park and go inside or order if you don't call ahead. Also, you can call ahead and go through the drive-thru to pick up your order if there's no line!  Overall, cheap and delicious but lame hours and parking situation!"}
{"text":"OMG YOU GUYS. The California club is incredible. The flavors work perfectly together and every bite is pure bliss. I just had it for the first time about ten minutes ago and will likely be back tomorrow for another. This sandwich is a mix of egg, avocado, tomato, cream cheese, some sort of sauce, all on a warm and tasty bun. On another note, prior to this afternoon I would always get the top notch burger, which is a black bean and quinoa patty, no meat (bacon) and add avocado. It is positively delectable as well- A great BBQ sauce accompanies the ingredients. The staff is great, even offering dog treats when my furbaby is in the car with me. Additionally, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and quick with service. This place is excellent in every way!"}
{"text":"Seriously thebomb.com. I get the chicken panini with the side of broccoli, and each time it come out super delicious! The staff is friendly and bring out your food in a timely manner. The drive through option is super convenient!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Ever want an abundance of healthy food that'll make you feel like you just walked out of an all-you-can buffet on a lazy Sunday afternoon? Then D'lite is the place for you!  The combo meal (Any which/wrap AND any side AND a drink) is too much for a lunch meal. Nonetheless the Tuna sandwhich is the best secret sauce/dill/cheese/spring mix/onion/cucumber/tomato/feta concoction. Portobello soup was satisfying fulfilling. We thought the Hummus plate was going to come in half size... well we thought all the items were going to be half size tbh.  We walked away with full teas and leftovers for snacks... for two days from now because that's when we'll feel hungry again!"}
{"text":"Hard to find healthy food that tastes so good! I always stop by this place when i go to arizona. Definitely a favorite"}
{"text":"The best! California breakfast club is so good. Its easy, quick and I know it will be good!"}
{"text":"I love this local spot. Everyone that works here is friendly, laid back and willing to help you figure out what you're craving.  My breakfast go to is their breakfast buzz with almond milk. It's a quick, nutritious and equally delicious jolt of caffeine with protein. It's filling and it keeps me full until lunch.   For lunch, my go to is there tuna salad wrap. It's not your typical tuna salad, because they refrain from using mayonnaise (thank heavens ), I also sub out the wrap for a sundried tomato one. So good!"}
{"text":"OH I so wanted to love this place.  Coffee: TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Oatmeal: OMG- watery quinoa, cold with mushed banana and berries Kitchen Sink Salad: Looked AMAZING....zero taste, no dressing and small.  All were to go...    Staff were very nice, super cute place....but a huge disappointment. Heard the juices are good but certainly won't be eating there again. :("}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches and croissants are just sooo good and healthy. Try their vanilla iced coffee as well!"}
{"text":"It won't be long until this locations is as busy as their original. Great service and cool Modern look inside. Nice and quiet on a Saturday at 9:30 to enjoy a breakfast buzz!"}
{"text":"I gave D'lish a second chance and the service was much better this time! The guys who work here are funny, friendly, and make you feel welcome. I like that they use all natural ingredients in everything they make here and I think that's why the food tastes so great."}
{"text":"Wow.. I love love D'lish. Food is so good and so well priced. I ended up getting the quinoa oatmeal for breakfast and with no regrets either. My friend got the breakfast bagel with eggs and bacon.. it was so filling that she ended up only eating half. I loved my oatmeal as well, the portions were perfect and it was D'lish! Would definitely love to come here for breakfast again"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great concept, and a breakfast buzz with extra espresso is gonna be wayyyyy better for you than anything blended from Dutch Brothers!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place has delicious food!! Found this place off of yelp trying to find a breakfast place to meet all the needs of everyone in our group and this place did its job. I will say parking is a hassle especially when the drive thru is packed. Yes it is a small place but I must say this place is worth it!! I recommend the southwest rice bowl hands down! Can't wait until the next time I visit here just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! 4 stars instead of 5 only because the staff don't have much in the way of personality even though they do a good job...just a personal thing. Been here 3 times in 2 weeks. I love that they 1) serve breakfast the whole day, 2) have a varied menu with health benefits noted and 3) have suriracha sauce on every table. I've had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast sandwich, both withr availability of chicken and/or bacon. Can't remember what else I had but everything has been good so far. Oh yeah, the 3-berry smoothie was tasty!"}
{"text":"Im obsessed. Every single day before work I have to pick up a thug buzz and a California Club sandwich to get me through my day. Its so delicious and filling! Someone recommended this place to me and I highly recommend to anyone!! I really wish there was one in north phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Everyone who works there is very friendly and great at helping you find something you will love. I go there at least once a week and get my favorite drink... an iced chai latter with almond milk. It is the BEST coffee drink I have had! I definitely recommend trying it, as well as their food items. I have only ate there for breakfast but everything on the menu looks d'lish and healthy! Plus, all of the items are all labeled as either vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, protein packed or balanced, which is helpful for those with food sensitivities.   All in all, I highly recommend this place for coffee, breakfast, lunch and even a mid-day snack."}
{"text":"I love this spot for a quick, healthy drive-thru lunch! They offer a great menu full of healthy dishes. My favorite is the Veggie D'Light wrap. the sauce is so tasty and I love all of the veggies. Great staff, too - they're always friendly and fun.  I haven't tried their breakfast, but want to. Great local spot!"}
{"text":"i also order the california club like others here with coffee. but i made it veggie as i prefer not to eat meet. it was great, they put a veggie Patti which was great.   Its a good place for vegeterians"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, smoothies and shakes are delicious, everything about this place is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try this place. The staff was really nice so that was good. I got a burger with bacon and grilled onion. They forgot to put on mushrooms like I asked for. The bun was a disappointment. And the quinoa black bean burger was dry and bland. It wasn't the veggie burger I was expecting. Sadly."}
{"text":"This is my first time there, I got a drink that was recommended by a friend and it was amazing! The line took a little bit but once I got to the window there was a very sweet blonde girl that helped me."}
{"text":"Love taking my girlfriend's daughter here! Vegan buzz is the way to go. Also had the Arizona Burro which is out of this world with their salsa on top."}
{"text":"Love this place! The location is clean, open, and welcoming. The food and drinks are as healthy as you would like. My family and I stop here a few times a week at least!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying the parking here is a nightmare. HOWEVER you can just go through the drive thru and continue on with your day without missing a beat.  I love having healthy food options available in a drive thru!!! Seriously- I can get a protein shake, rice bowl, hummus, or great salads all within minutes! Lately I've just been getting the breakfast buzz smoothie which is very filling. The prices are very comparable with other fast food options as well."}
{"text":"Probably time to update this review.. I've been here quite a few times since last rating and they have definately improved.  As always, the food at D'lish is wonderful. Great combination of salads, unique and healthy sandwiches, a bonus of tasty protein shakes. The atmosphere is still good as well-kind of trendy, but good mix of students and locals. The parking and drive thru are still cramped (nothing they can do there), but they've improved the drive thru speed by taking orders carside during busy times. Which leads me to the biggest update... happily, the real change and improvement comes from their service. I remember a time when service here was slow and painful. No more. The new crew is pleasant, helpful and competent. Hallelujah."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast here a couple of times when I come to Tempe no business trips.  Always quick, friendly, and good quality.   Made a misjudgment this latest visit and I ordered the wrong item (too early for the brain to work properly)....anyhow when he brought me what I ordered I thought perhaps they too my order wrong NOPE it was totally my bust.  He said no problem he would replace it with what I really wanted.  Even after I offered to pay for both....  That's really cool."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it and the flavors. I had the chicken panini and the bf had the breakfast bagel. It doesn't include any sides but we weren't too hungry anyway.   Service was fine... run by some older teens. Not that friendly but not bad service either. I think one kid was in training as I think I knew the menu better than he did, and it was my first time there! :-P I'm sure he'll do fine."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been here just a few times, but everything has been great.  This morning I ordered the kombucha (always good) and the low-carb breakfast.  Looking at the ingredients of the breakfast (eggs, tomato, hash browns, mixed greens) I was a little nervous, but gave it a shot and was not disappointed.  The pesto \"dressing\" pulled it all together.  Well played D'lish, well played."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful, interesting food and a cute, small indie shop vibe with an outdoor patio - love it!!  Their protein burger, house style, is probably my favorite veggie burger in the valley. They call it hearty and healthy, and it is, but the taste is the best part: house style has portobello, feta, pesto, cucumber sauce and tomatoes - wow!!   Delicious breakfast, too, and they have a bustling drive-through window. Come early: they close at 4pm. And watch out: they have no public restrooms."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable breakfast here. The low carb breakfast was filling and tasty. Service was incredibly fast and efficient. We hung out on the patio for a good hour after we ate and no one encouraged us to leave. Yes, it was hot and patrons were mostly drive through but still, no one bugged us.   Customers kept coming out with this delicious coffee/shake beverage but I never got a chance to ask them what it was. I will definitely be back for breakfast and order that yummy looking concoction."}
{"text":"D'Lish is my go to spot for a healthy but very tasty breakfast. I have had  a bunch of things here, from the frittata to the AZ breakfast burro, the croissant breakfast sandwhich to the chicken/curry/vegetable/basmati rice thing...and it's all legit!  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is simple: it's a bit pricey ($8 for a breakfast burrito or $5 for a small croissant breakfast sandwich is a bit much) and the parking situation here is brutal. Drive-thru line up could literally leave you out on the street.  But again...it's VERY good food"}
{"text":"Their hash browns aren't deep fried after all :D Wooohoooo !"}
{"text":"Was visiting a pal in Scottsdale and he mentioned this place.  Everything on the menu sounded good.  A few selections for each options. I got a \"burger\" with bbq sauce and Swiss.  The burger was black beans and quinoa.  It had a decent texture, tasted great.  The bbq sauce was a good amount of spicy.    A plus is they are environmentally conscious.  They tell you what goes in what bin. They use actual dishes.  Definite pluses!  The staff was super friendly.  Made the visit very positive"}
{"text":"This particular Monday I was in the mood for something healthy and affordable and with it's overwhelming positive reviews I figured it would be a place to check out.  After waiting in line in the drive through for what seemed like forever, I finally inched through the tiny drive-through/parking area and ordered my food.  The selection is limited and I think the price is misrepresented.  I would probably put it at least at $$.  For a simple tuna sandwich and a medium drink to put me back almost $11 without any sides.  For $6.50 I thought, this sandwich had better be amazing.  It was meh.  New flavors and combos with the tuna salad that I hadn't really thought of before, including diced carrots? Strange, but the flavors were interesting.  Sweeter than I would have liked.  I'm more of a savory lover.  All in all, I was not that impressed with the food and the price.  Especially since I could've gotten a bigger sandwich with a side of chips (or salad) and a cookie from Bread Basket Bakery for $.25 cheaper.  Thanks for the experience, but I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by after reading the reviews...well deserved.   Service was quick, polite, and very helpful.  Seems like a perfect grab and go spot for breakfast, especially after a long night of drunkeness.  Ordered the AZ Buro and it hit all kinds of spots. Light, but filling, exactly what I wanted this morning.  Will be back in a few hours for lunch."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with D'lite! Especially this location! The staff is always super friendly. They always remember me and my order, which is awesome! Makes my whole day! I will say I am addicted the the vegan buzz! Niqkole and Aleck hands down make the best ones! I adds shot of espresso to my buzz and it makes it the perfect blend of protein and coffee. Hummus is amazing and all the food always tastes fresh. Great vegan options and green iced tea is out of this world. If you need a great brunch spot, meeting or just hang out D'lite is my jam! Thank you for always making my mornings and occasional afternoon the best!!"}
{"text":"2 Words: Breakfast Buzz."}
{"text":"Not cheap but I come pretty often because I love their food. Stopped by today to get breakfast, wow.. Worst customer service.I have never posted negative reviews before on yelp. Employee gave me attitude. So RUDE. That's NOT how you want to treat costumers. I don't know if she had a rude customer before me or what, but I will never go back to this location. Not worth ruining my day for the food. I agree with other comments that employees at Tempe location is more friendly and welcoming. Would give no star if I could."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Slightly limited menu, but any place that is vegan friendly is hard to come by, so I was happy. Small place with a peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious and nutritious selections. I love that they have a drive through and service is always with a smile!"}
{"text":"I heard really good things about this place so after a hike up \"A\" mountain with my sister, we decided to try it out. Both of us were first timers and it took us awhile to decide what we wanted because everything on the menu sounded so good.   We both ordered the Traditional Burrito with chicken sausage and my sister added avocado to hers. We took our order to go. We unwrapped our burrito and couldn't wait to take a bite ...  Now for the 2 stars .... I took a bite into mines and there was a string of hair hanging out from it. Yup, I was really really disappointed. My sister however enjoyed hers.   Would I try this place again? Possibly, we'll see."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can explain on my lunch experience. My cup of soup felt empty when I took it out of the bag, it wasn't even half full. Additionally, they forgot my pita chips that come with the  soup. The guy looked too baked to be working and  I had to ask for my juice or I would  have  not gotten that either.  I tried to call in 8 times to rectify the situation and explain the overall experience and nobody answered.  I love the food quality and  premise behind the business, but outliers such as this tarnish the name. Each week it seems to get worse.  I usually come a few days a week when I don't  have time to prep my meal. I don't want them to lose my business, but this is too much for an easy order."}
{"text":"LOVE visiting this D'lite location! I am always greeted with a smile and my breakfast buzz (all toddy) is consistently delivered quick and tastes amazing! Tons of comfortable seating room if you decide to dine in but the biggest bonus for this busy, working mom.. is the drive-thru! Thanks D'lite you have a customer for life!"}
{"text":"WILL TRAVEL FOR BREAKFAST BUZZ! I got turned on to the Breakfast Buzz from the radio host, JohnJay! It took months of him raving about it before I finally talked myself into driving over to Scottsdale to give it a try. Oh Em Gee, its D'Licious!!  The kick of the espresso, fullness of the protein and the mixture of all the ingredients makes for the perfect pick me up drink. I am a fan for life and will travel for D'lite Healthy On The Go! THANK YOU! A+ customer service A+ ambiance A+ food quality"}
{"text":"One of the best tastin' and healthiest breakfast I ever had.  I had the California breakfast club and a caramel latte.  The latte was good too.  Service was very friendly.    Tempe food rocks.  Photo attached."}
{"text":"This place is crazy delicious, the food is fresh, and I feel like its reasonably priced. However if you're in any kind of hurry do not go inside, even if the drive-thru line is long. They obviously give priority to those customers no matter the order. Also it's hit or miss whether the person working the drive through is any good. They either can't understand, or get annoyed with small requests (like not having the straw in the cup). But again, the food is REALLY good. So I'll keep coming back and hope for a high turnover rate."}
{"text":"D'lish is so d'lovely, especially knowing that I can call ahead and order in the drive through on my way! Talk about efficiency. As if the drive-through wasn't fast enough, now by ordering ahead there's practically no wait time! On my way there now!"}
{"text":"Ok WOW! Need a fast but NOT \"fast\" food meal. This is the place to be. Amazing healthy food that comes out quick. For all you men who think you're too manly for a salad come sink your teeth into The 'Man' Salad and wash it down with a \"Breakfast Buzz\" (protein, espresso, milk, bananas, chocolate, & peanut butter). Guaranteed to fill you up and still complement that gym workout. Bowls, Burgers. Whiches/Wraps, Salads, Shakes, & even some pretty dang good Breakfast. With locations in Scottsdale, Tempe, & just around the corner in Hawaii, make sure to pop in or hit the drive through for some D'Lish fast food that is anything but \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I have to resist coming here every time I am in the area, it is that good!  The California Club Breakfast sandwich is my GO-TO.  The artisan bread on it is so so good!  I quickly saw a trend of EVERYONE ordering the morning buzz, so I had to check it out.  Definitely glad that i did! Great drink to get you going in the morning!   The wait can be long, but worth it."}
{"text":"Passing by this place I decided to stop by and check it out. Happy to say I was not disappointed. Staff were pleasant and patient with me taking my time. I ordered a breakfast buzz which was absolutely amazing and a club sandwich. Sandwich was tasteful and never seen cream cheese on an egg before. Will for sure be stopping by this place again!"}
{"text":"Have been to D'lish a few times now and really enjoy everything I've gotten. Today I wasn't toooo hungry so I got the 1/2 AB &J w/banana slices. It was a perfect size 1/2 sandwich and the almond butter was so fresh as well as the jelly and nanners. I will certainly get this again soon. I also had the Beet side Salad. While it is small it was the perfect size to go with the 1/2 sandwich. I also got the Dream Tea. Again, a great choice.  On my previous visit I had gotten the southwest rice bowl. The serving was HUGE but it was sooooo good I ate the entire thing! (I was wanting to save some for a snack later but couldn't stop eating it).  They are super friendly and great service. They will also give you great suggestions on menu items or if it is your first time.  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy food I love having for breakfast or lunch! They're vegan buzz is the most amazing thing you'll drink. It's chocolatey with coffee protein and more. I love living right around the corner from them!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, it will go above and beyond your expectations. Fast service, very friendly service. The smoothies are also amazing. Try this spot out!"}
{"text":"This place has great customer service and awesome sandwiches and coffee is mm! I've gone a few times before work. Haven't been for lunch but many of the breakfast items I've tried are very good.  I always go inside because the drive thru line is insane always going onto the street. Usually 7 cars at a time. Only complaint is wish it had a larger parking lot. the place is so small and cozy inside. Only other issue is if you eat there. Be sure to have headphones. The smoothie / drink maker they're using 24/7 for the drive thru peeps is VeRY loud. Can't hear what the person across the table is saying.   Otherwise a great quick bite!"}
{"text":"Wanting to avoid my hotel's 'free breakfast', I made a short trip to D'lish and am very glad I did. Enjoyed a vegie frittata and coffee. Service was very friendly and quick. I'd estimate seating for 20 indoor w/a patio out front.  The coffee was very good and a nice alternative to the chains.   I will definitely make it a regular stop when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!  Scrumptious humanitarian (think vegan) wrap had the option to add chicken, feta and pesto to its quinoa, hummus and veggies base... absolutely delightful when wrapped up in a tomato tortilla.  Coupled that with the orange glorious smoothie - which basically tastes like a melted creamsicle, without the calories!  Awesome place and a lucky little find... thanks fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"walked over today after the parada del sol for a bite to eat. we had the dog and they have a few patio chairs so we could enjoy our meal outside with the pooch.   i ordered the humanitarian wrap...filled with quinoa, veggies, and hummus in a sun-dried tomato tortilla. it was ok, but kind of like something i could just make at home. i had to drip siracha on it for every bite to get any real flavor. i only tasted hummus at the very last bite, down near the bottom of the wrap.   their other options look good, with plenty of choices for vegans, veggies, gluten free'ers, and meat eaters. what knocked the place down a star was that...we saw one of the cooks come outside with her food prep gloves on, buy a box of cookies from a troop of girl scouts standing on the sidewalk, and then walk back inside. i HOPE she took those gloves off and put new ones on. i really, really, really don't want to see the person preparing my food handling items other than my food with those gloves..."}
{"text":"I love eating at d'lite! They are getting so popular it is sometimes hard to get in the drive through line! I'd recommend calling in your order and picking it up inside. But the food is so delicous and makes you feel really good! I like getting the humanitarian wrap and also the veggie burgers! The price is always fair for the delicous portion you'll receive :)"}
{"text":"Eaten here before. Was good. But today I ordered the frittata with egg white and they said they couldn't do it they are pre done. what? Just left no more to say."}
{"text":"I have liked everything I've tried. Their Housestyle Protein burger is wonderful and filling. Their turkey club is everything it should be. They have great breakfast sandwiches. I usually drive-thru to get a drink, they make a wicked Dirty-Chai. I love that I can get any drink made with Almond or Rice milk. The Breakfast Buzz is perfect for anytime of the day. I regularly get the Oatmeal Our Way because it is gluten-free. They have a few gluten free options which is nice, but I think they could get more creative with it. Once you are a regular the staff is very nice. It's pricey, but I can't seem to stay away."}
{"text":"Found this gem based on Yelp reviews and it definitely doesn't disappoint!!!!  My personal favorite has been the AZ burro which has been so filling that I either skip lunch or eat a late lunch. I've also tried the veggie burrito and that is filling too. I really can't wait to try the other menu items including the green lemonade that other Yelpers have posted."}
{"text":"Last few times have been consistent! Love the salad. Cant help but keep going back. So D'lish!"}
{"text":"I really love the menu selection here. There are a lot of healthy options that provide an awesome alternative to the many other fast food places around. The California club, their signature breakfast sandwich is delicious. They also have the breakfast buzz protein shake which may be one of the best shakes I've had. Unfortunately drive through wait times can be pretty long, even when there's not many cars ahead of you, but I guess that's the price you pay for quick and healthy food. I also think some of the items are a bit overpriced but other than that this is a great stop for anyone on the go."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem for veg. And healthy people. I would come back here again great place to go to for early rising sun people. Beautiful people."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  OMG, so awesome!  Great concept.  Would love to see more GF/Vegan options but no complaints as what we ordered was delicious.  Breakfast wrap was altered to accomodate my food choices.    OJ was worth the $3!"}
{"text":"super fast, super friendly, super healthy.   My favorite drink is the \"buzzkill.\" It's not on the menu but it's a breakfast buzz without the espresso. I love that they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"This is the best thing to happen to my neighborhood! I used to frequent the locations in Tempe when they were called D'lish when I was in the neighborhood. I love the breakfast buzz, the frittatas, and burritos. The prices are *so* reasonable for what they give you. The food is very fresh, healthy, and delicious and they have all the alternative milks you could wish for."}
{"text":"By far my go to place for lunch and breakfast! When living in Arizona I would come here twice a day sometimes almost everyday! I love everything on the menu and the staff is always friendly. Haven't been here in over a year but I gotta say D'lish is by far my go to place in scottsdale and tempe!"}
{"text":"I like what this business is doing ... trying to get people to eat healthier. But their food is pretty blan."}
{"text":"I was super happy to find this place on my way to work.  Coffee is good-service is always super friendly.  Had breakfast once and it was pretty good, though if you are getting it in the drive-through it seems to take a while....but it's fresh food made there-what can you expect...."}
{"text":"This is the BOMBEST spot to get your morning fuel up. Breakfast Buzz.. Absolutely the best way to get started in the AM. I'll always get the oatmeal and a breakfast club. Filling, delicious, and doesn't make me food stoned! A unicorn breakfast, I know, but it exists here.   No wonder everyone here is so chipper! Smiling faces in the early hours makes anyone's day so much better. My boy Leonard always hooks it up with a smile and a laugh.   No better place in Scottsdale to get morning grub!"}
{"text":"Had heard good things about this place. My boyfriend and I ordered two breakfast burritos (egg, cheese, and a small side of salsa). It was okay, nothing tasty, and my burrito came with a thick strand of human hair. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"YES. So good. I'm not sure if they tell the employees to behave the way they do ( 1/2 stoner,  1/2 flirt) but it always entertains me and service is not sacrificed. Consistently amazzziiinngg food and that breakfast buzz is spot-on #worththe600calories  PRO TIP: order the Baby Buzz. it is the same as a breakfast buzz but smaller/cheaper."}
{"text":"What can I say, I absolutely adore this place. My usual order is large green tea and a California club. Their club is by far the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. It had smoked turkey, eggs, bacon, cream cheese and more.  On top if the great food, their employees are amazing. They are always super friendly, incredibly patient, and have never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and tasty. I love it so much that I always order the same thing! The California Club is amazing and you can actually taste all the ingredients... It's not just a mishmash of things that seem like it's not worth paying for.   The hummus plate is very good. I wish they gave more pita bread because we always have way more hummus in the end.   For two people it's about 20 dollars (excluding tip) if you get drinks too."}
{"text":"This is a great location. I alternate between this cafe and the one in Scottsdale. I didn't find a difference in the food.   The California Club and hummus plate is just as tasty. I really like the wide parking area. There are menus outside where you park so you can peruse the choices at your leisure!!  I wish it stayed open longer but that's the only gripe. Prices I can't argue with because I think it's worth it because it's so fresh but I can't afford to eat out here everyday, unfortunately! Heh."}
{"text":"so i've been here a couple times now and i'm only writing this because i am definitely a fan of this place. i've only gotten the chicken pesto panini but it's just so damn good, i can't bring myself to try anything else. this, however, ain't exactly healthy for you as it's loaded down with pesto and feta AND it's served up on some texas toast! damn! my friend has gotten a few different things including some kinda turkey wrap and a club sandwich. they were both very good too!  parking and seating can be tough during lunch-i've warned you!  bonus points for being locally owned."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz is amazing!! Espresso  peanut butter protein smoothie. Everyone ive shared this item with has become addicted."}
{"text":"This place had he best black bean burger I have ever had! Totally opened up my world to vegetarian burgers! And the breakfast buzz keeps me going all day!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!  First what I'm so impressed with is their menu and healthy options. I love the variety of choices you can get.  I got their Breakfast club because its one of their most popular items.   It was good not as great as the other reviews say. The reason why I say that is because I feel it has the making of a great sandwich but they layer it wrong. You have bread, pesto, cream cheese, tomato, smoked turkey and bacon. Because the only texture you get Is the bacon if they put that on top of the cream cheese it would enhance your chewing experience.   Still tasty just mushy.  Hubby-Breakfast burrito with sausage and bacon and he loved it!!!! He came back two days in a row for it.  Next time I want to try the coffee and salads.  Great place"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Great concept - fast food that is fresh & healthy. Breakfast Buzz with almond milk is amazing. I've had almost everything on the menu. All of their items are tasty. You can't go wrong at D'life :)"}
{"text":"Was expecting so much better. No toasted bagel like I asked and the bacon was so crispy it was basically charred and had no flavour. The eggs taste old and a little odd. I guess you can't expect good food out of the drive thru"}
{"text":"The food is just as great as the Scottsdale location, but the service here sucks! They are so slow it drives me insane waiting to get my food even when its not busy.  Even just ordering a coffee took 10 minutes. 10 minutes!! Would have been faster just to drive up to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I eat here probably 3 times a week. It's pretty healthy.  They also cater to many people's dietary constraints ie vegan, veg etc.  It's delicious and the staff is very warm and welcoming.   I literally bring all my friends here.   Oh, and they're dog friendly!!"}
{"text":"Order taker: cup or bowl? Bowl. And I get a cup.   California club on a croissant. Get regular bread.   Seriously dude? Why even take the orders if you're not going to listen?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! For a place that's crazy popular and busy, the service is super fast! I was definitely impressed. They have gluten free wraps, which I believe are Udi's. It's very satisfying if you're craving a breakfast sandwich! I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I used to drive past this place every day on my was to ASU, but did not even know anything about it until I read about it online. Oh man, I am sure glad I did.  It is hard finding a good, healthy, vegetarian/vegan friendly fast food place, so having a place like this around is just awesome. Not to mention, the service is great, the staff is always entertaining. I had one guy working the drive through flip out with excitement because I had a gingerbread house kit in my passenger seat. He also kept referring to me  as 'homegirl' haha.   I have not been able to bring myself to try anything other than the veggie burgers, since I just love veggie burgers so much! I usually go for the Early Bird. The quinoa black bean patty itself seems a tad bland to me actually, but the toppings so make up for it. The fried egg and chipotle aioli are fabulous on that burger. The buns are delicious as well. Plus they are huge, fill you up fast!  D'lish is relatively inexpensive for the quality for the ingredients. I think the concept of this restaurant is awesome and I would love to see more places similar to this!"}
{"text":"I've been to both of the other D'lite locations (practically lived at the Tempe one during senior year of college), but this one was the best by far! Unlike the other two, this one is spacious, plenty of parking and room to sit inside! Although for some reason it was a little hard for me and my sister to find when using google maps. There were not any customers when I came so we got great service haha. I ordered my favorite, the early bird. I feel like the black bean quinoa patty was a tad smaller than usual when comparing my current early bird pic with the old one. But still delicious and enough to fill me up. My sister got the croissant sandwich and loved it! Prices are fair too for such good quality food. We also both got the decaf desert blossom iced tea and loved it. I am so happy to not have to drive so far to get my d'lite fix anymore!"}
{"text":"They have the best Dirty Chai I've ever tasted!  What's better is if you order a large without ice it can last you well into the afternoon.  Score!"}
{"text":"D'lish stands by its name.  These little sandwiches are packed with so many ingredients that make them delicious.  I love the fact that they have a drive though and their lattes are better than Starbucks.   I've been to both locations and I always get super friendly service.  This place is perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been comming here over 2 yrs now and will never come back. First the parking situation is ridiculous. Second there food is over priced and not even that good. The other day I waiting in the drive through for 20mins before they ordered my food which was at the window they are supposed to give you your order.  Once I ordered my food they lady  came out of the window waving her hands with my sandwich in her hands cuz I had my window up which take 2 seconds to roll down. She basically threw my sandwich at me and left. I couldn't even give them back thier clipboard that had my credit card slip on it."}
{"text":"I don't know of another drive-thru shop that offers everything you could want (and need) for breakfast. The low-carb breakfast always helps me start off my day right. And the shakes and smoothies are bomb. The staff have always been really cool and friendly too. Must be a fun place to work."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC where things are fast this place is really fast regardless how busy there drive threw is the food is always high quality and consistent  and healthy And the staff are super friendly good vibes good people if you want good fast organic healthy food this is the place to come and stay healthy"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The cali club and the breakfast buzz are delicious. I've been here countless times and they've never once messed up an order so the staff deserves credit. However, the prices are high, and the lot is tiny. They're supposed to be \"healthy to-go\" but the to-go process is super inconvenient. Most of the time, the line is backed up into the street so cars are honking at you. Parking is almost never an option unless you want to wait in the drive through line. I'm sure buying another lot next door isn't an option but if it is, it could seriously improve this place. Even with the inconvenience, I continue to come back for the food/service."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST breakfast sandwiches in town.  I come here all he time when i want a filling/healthy/delicious breakfast.  If you don;t want anything that heavy i am also a fan of their low carb breakfast...Their dinner pasta bowl is also really good-i'm not the biggest fan of their lunch though, not that it isn't good, it's just that i expected it to match how much i love their breakfast-but you might have a different taste.  The other reason this isn't a 5star rating is also because they can take a long time.  Most of the time it's fine because they are making it from scratch but sometimes it goes over average and when that happens you would think it would be better than the last time but they aren't the most consistent.  Please-go here for breakfast and try it, it's a great neighborhood coffee place."}
{"text":"So I've been to D'lish many of times before and I've been meaning to write a review for months but today....I just had to document my experience.  D'lish always has a pretty big wait and rightfully so. I ordered a banana strawberry smoothie that was killer and a AZ burrito BUT...I got this bad boy enchilada style. Best decision I've made her by far.  I've had the black bean burger, the bowls, the sandwiches but this burrito enchilada style is the best if I haven't made my point already! Service is always great and friendly and there isn't really much negativity I can bring to the table for this place.  Maybe one thing is to stay open later! There's not really a place like this and I'd come here a lot more if they were open later too. Keep it up D'lish!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot! They offer a drive thru and sit down, inside or outside. If one of these existed where I live, I would be there every morning. Try the California club, it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Thanks for being on happy cow app! Love finding new places for healthy eating :)"}
{"text":"Would really like to try this place but waiting in the drive thru for 15 minutes is a joke."}
{"text":"Had the California Club(breakfast sandwich) and an Ice Americano for breakfast here. Both were amazing! The California club was delicious! In addition to great food and a cool little restaurant the staff was super cool! The two employees that were there were very nice and I chatted with them while I ate. great food, great people = win."}
{"text":"I recently moved just down the street from this new location, I am a big fan of the original one on Scottsdale road so I was pretty stoked!  Just like the Scottsdale location the food is great and the staff is very nice and friendly. I always get the California breakfast club and a large iced Americano. The Buzz is also a great drink but somewhat pricey. I think this location has a nicer outdoor seating area than the original but overall the service and quality are identical."}
{"text":"One word : Deeeeeelicious! I have tried every single place around here for lunch and I curse myself for not having tried the food here before. The place is small and does not ideally make the cut for a date but if you are seriously scourging for lip smacking food, D'lish will leave you content and smiling. I had the veggie d'lite wrap and for 6 bucks, it was gold! The drive-through can become a little busy during lunch time but the staff is prompt and gets the food out on time. I'll probably head there again soon for a bigger bite."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast here. I came here on Saturday morning after looking for a place that served green smoothie, this one came up on my Yelp search. I was on my way to fit company challenge and was in need of light and healthy breakfast.  Service was excellent, friendly and thoughtful, thank you for the extra maple syrup and agave for oatmeal.  I like that they have this recycling system, I am happy to participate. I liked that they installed a foot pedal thing to open the restroom door to avoid people using paper towels to open the door. Reducing paper napkins consumption helps with environment.  Green lemonade was pretty good. Didn't have that too much kale taste to it, easy to drink. I started juice punch card after 10 drinks or so, I get one free drink. Since they have convenient drive through available, I might stop by here on my way to work in the morning.  Breakfast was very good, really enjoyed my sandwich, gave me enough energy without feeling heavy to get through two hours of fit company challenge.  One negative might be is their metal chairs. They have comfy chair along the wall but all others are metal. Not so good if you come with short shorts like I did.   If you want healthy breakfast, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. I recommend the California Club and the Az Buro. Fast service. The true mark of a great place is how they handle issues. This place surpasses the mark. This morning I received the wrong breakfast sandwich. The manager made it completely right and brought us a gift card for future use. He was friendly, apologetic, and I remain very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"They have great food but the service is so slow. If you go through the drive-through it's a guarantee of 20 to 25 minute wait."}
{"text":"have I truly never reviewed D'lish???  5 stars for the Orange Glorious. this was my fave thing to drink when I was pregnant. I would drive here, get an OG to go and then go get my nails done. love it.  Everything here is pretty amazing - the food has always been great. This last time I had one of the paninis and it really hit the spot. But again, I waaaas starving from tending to a crying baby... ;)  The only drawbacks are 1)the parking situation sucks 2) the drive thru CAN take a bit of time depending on when you go, but it's all made fresh so... eh. 3) getting into and out of their lot can also be a hassle. But otherwise, it's all good."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place solely based on the yelp reviews. Folks it will not disappoint.  The service and food were all on point. I went with their suggestions and got a CA Club and d'buzz. I will be coming back regularly. It is rare to find a place so well put together. I hope they open more locations across the valley!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with this place.  Every single thing about it is perfect.  The food.  The drinks.  The service.  The quaintness of the building.  I couldn't possibly explain in words how great I think this place is, but I will surely try.    The first time I ever went here was on New Year's Day and my friends and I still had on our Happy New Years dresses, heels, makeup, the whole 9-yards AND to top it off...we were sporting the hats that boasted HAPPY NEW YEAR all sparkly and obnoxious on it that we had somehow acquired the night before.  We were, needless to say, a bit hungover and ready for some delicious food after an incredible night.  The owners happened to be working that day and immediately jumped on board with us and joined us in shouting happy new year and then proceeded to explain the menu and take their time with us since we were clearly in no state to comprehend much of anything.  Needless to say, I fell in love with not only the owners but also the California Club (which we order on a croissant and add a hashbrown patty to).  This sandwich is like heaven, but better because it exists and is edible.  Seriously, if you're reading this, just stop and head over there for a California Club right now.  It'll be the best thing you have ever done with your life.  Ever since that day, I make special trips to this place (considering I live nearly an hour from it) and have never once been disappointed with the service or anything else.  This place can do no wrong and I just hope more people get the chance to try it because this is one place that should never go out of business."}
{"text":"D'lish is one of the best breakfast and lunch places in town. It's a small hole in the wall, but the people are friendly, the food is fresh, and healthy, and it's quick. I don't think I've been there when there hasn't been a line of people waiting for some awesome food. Even with a line you get fast friendly service. I highly recommend the AZ Burro or the California Club! Two of my favorites with an Almond Milk Latte."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to D'lish, my business partner talks about this place to no end so I've been excited to try it. It didn't disappoint. I went with the breakfast burrito with chicken sausage and it was really great. They also have almond milk, which I love, so I had a latte with almond milk as well. The food was amazing, very clean, and healthy. They have everything from Vegan, to Gluten Free, and are able to add chicken to anything for you meat eaters. I highly recommend this place. My only criticism is their parking situation is a little less than desirable. It's a very small and tight parking lot, we even saw that someone's car got hit while parked."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally stopped in for lunch the day before yesterday.  It wasn't too crowded and I was able to get my order in quickly.They also gave me two stamps on my punch card because it was my first visit!  I ordered the cold tuna sandwich on toasted wheat bread.  Oh man, that's a great sandwich!  The pomegranate green iced tea was delicious as well.  I really like D'lite and will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Love their iced tea!  I also really enjoy their soups.  When I am not eating Paleo their sandwiches are also quite tasty.  Great place for a healthy, quick lunch."}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch and coffee house is a diamond in the rough. I had the low carb breakfast. A hash brown pattie on a bed of fresh greens w a well seasoned vinaigrette  on top of that were slices of avocado and two overhard eggs and topped with pesto.  My friend had the quinoa oatmeal with fresh fruit and loved it. The only drawback is parking if the drive through is full you wait. At least someone will occasionally come out to get your order so it hopefully moves faster. If you do want to park it may be better to go in the out side."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Their chicken panini is terrific. Their salads and soups are flavorful. Their smoothies and juices are really great too. I like that they are dog friendly where people bring their fur babies and sit outside. Customer service here is consistently great."}
{"text":"I was honestly pretty surprised at how huge the menu is at this place - and for a drive-thru, too! Lots of lighter, healthier options on the menu, although I thought my \"signature\" California Club was a bit heavy. I'll try something new next time. Expect to wait a bit in the drive-thru line, because they're running a full kitchen inside. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great healthy menu and the atmosphere is cozy with modern decor.  Love going in for the breakfast buzz! Their salads and bowls are delicious as well."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with coffee. I love the smell, coffee ice cream is delicious but I don't necessarily enjoy drinking it. Many times, I just do it for the caffeine. And I refuse to get a hyper flavored concoction that have 3,758 calories. I like to eat my calories, not drink them thankyouverymuch.  Since it's hotter than the 6th circle of hell, I decided for iced coffee. I always pass d'lish on my way to work and decided to finally try it. The interior is tiny, it feels like a cool doll house to me. I had an iced coffee and wow!!!!!! It was amazingly good. I tried another day ( and another and another) to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I'm glad to say it wasn't. My iced coffee has been equally great every single time. I also had a bialy with cream cheese and it was very tasty. I'm looking forward to try their hot coffee once is not  115* out."}
{"text":"Food quality sucks despite what they advertise and the parking lot is pretty ridiculous. The customer service there is nothing to brag about either...."}
{"text":"I must admit I was very skeptical before going.  it's just a sandwich/wrap shop I thought to myself.  I was surprised with the quality of the food.  We ordered the d'veggie bowl and it was amazing.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp.  They were out of quinoa, and rice was substituted, but it fit the bowl perfectly.  The sauce was tasty without being overpowering.  Friendly service.  Excellent place.  Hopefully, i'll get a chance to go back."}
{"text":"This place has the beeesssst protein shakes. The service is wonderful as well. Seriously nice people. The facility is really nice as well. We were just passing through otherwise I would have gone there for lunch too!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for a quick lunch without having to resort to fast food. They have a drive thru and fast service. I've tried to breakfast club, which is VERY good, the tuna sandwich, humanitarian wrap, and turkey club. Everything I've had thus far has been delicious. Very friendly and happy workers there too."}
{"text":"I've avoided D'lish like the plague because the menu was so basic... but fast forward 4 years of residing in Scottsdale and I can't stop chugging breakfast buzzes.  WTF is wrong with me?  I'm seriously addicted to them.  And the humanitarian wraps.  How the hell did these guys make broccoli taste good in a wrap?  Because it's so good!  I come here probably once a week - and it's not even out of convenience.  I'll find an excuse to go, because I've convinced myself that a sugary drink is a \"healthy lunch\".  Augh.  Anyway, I'm officially converted and I'm not mad about it.  Here's to getting that dukedom #yelpelitegoals."}
{"text":"Ive been going to the place since it was D'lish... & it holds true to it's name. I prefer the AZ burro, sans the turkey breast. Everyone around me loves the breakfast buzz... I just don't do coffee.  My husband got the lunch panini and said it was even better than the breakfast burros. Point is, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for healthy delicious food! My two favorite things on the menu are definitely the Breakfast Buzz (w/ Almond milk) and the Southwest Rice Bowl! Although this place is a little pricer than ideal, it is definitely worth the money and the Buzz actually keeps me full for several hours so it's definitely not your average smoothie/shake. This particular location is pretty spacious and also eco-friendly which is always cool to see. Highly recommend trying if you have not already!"}
{"text":"omg am i addicted?!? am i obsessed!?   i can not get over this place and my california club!!!  i have my entire office hooked on d'lish now. we now have a lot of\"meetings\" at d'lish. we can not get enough."}
{"text":"I am so happy we chose this place for January Yelp Office Hours today... we had a great turnout, but better than that, I found my new favorite Old Town area coffee shop!  I started out with a hot peppermint tea, and a few hours later, I chose a breakfast sandwich for lunch - let me tell you... it was d'lish!  Kyle and Chad - great name for your place, and thanks for the hospitality also.    I can't wait for my next visit as I hear the dirty chai (chai tea latte with espresso shots) and the breakfast buzz shake are winning combinations as well.  I love that there are so many healthy options on the menu to choose from.  Not to mention outdoor seating, good vibe/music inside, and a drive-thru - how cool is that?!"}
{"text":"It's been 2 months since my first visit and I've been back through the \"d'liteful\" drive-thru a handful of times since... love that.  I'm also making good on my promise to report back on the wifi and inside since I checked that out also... five stars for the inside seating, wifi, and customer service as well!    Every employee I've interacted with at DHOTG is super friendly and genuine.  They custom my order without complaint and get it right every time.    Inside, there's plenty of comfortable seating and the place is clean!  Bathrooms are clean too.  I have no complaints about this place, hence another five star update.  I'll definitely be keeping you in the rotation, D'lite.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of D'lite since my days at ASU. Upon coming home last week to visit the family for Thanksigiving, my sister in law (but really my sister) @gabi m, mentioned their new location.   After an early morning yoga class, I decided to stop in and wow was I surprised. This new location is spacious and beautiful. I tend to use their drive thru but didn't have patience to sit on the long line.   Thankfully when I went in, I was greeted with huge smiles by all the employees.   Here are my goto's at D'lite:   1. The Breakfast buzz but I substitute Totty for Milk  2. The Early Bird but protein style (aka on a bed of lettuce) with avocado and extra aioli sauce ;)  3. The Kitchen Sink Salad  4. The 'Man' Salad"}
{"text":"very small quaint nice location.  A little bit of a hippie / granola feel there, that is not a negative thing by the way.  Food is amazingly fast for the quality and rather inexpensive too.  The real question... will I come back to get more food or drink there... yes, I think I will.  I'm may try their drive thru next time...  They even made a special drink for me and charge me the normal .    only pitfall, but it's a pretty big pitfall, is it seems that most of the employees are not paying attention to the customers, rather just going back and forth talking to each other."}
{"text":"This place is a delight. Best for breakfast. The low carb breakfast is light yet filling. The pesto they drizzle over it is amazing and also used in some of their sandwiches. I also frequently get the egg and cheese sandwich- add avocado! The bread they use is so soft and yummy. All the ingredients are fresh. It really is healthy on the go.... the food comes out so fast! Ok the one down side to this place is also the best part about it- when you sit inside the blenders are constantly going off and they are LOUD buttttt these blenders are making the breakfast buzz! A delightful mix of peanut butter, banana, espresso and chocolate protein. Quite possibly the best way to start your day, or afternoon! If you're coming later in the day try the hummus and don't be afraid to still get a breakfast buzz. Your taste buds will thank me."}
{"text":"I am watching my calories and this is my new favorite spot! I cannot stop coming here!!! Heard about this on Jon Jay and Rich...and I am so happy I stopped in. Everything has been yummy even though it is super healthy and the staff is very friendly! I would highly recommend this spot to anyone!"}
{"text":"So I come here for the first time in a while and order a ham egg and cheese sandwich on a plain bagel. The person at the counter could not hear me do to the loudness of the blender for smoothies running and puts in the order for a egg cheese bagel sandwich. My order comes out and I tell the person that I ordered a ham egg and cheese sandwich. They bring it in the back without question to change it. They return with a turkey egg and cheese sandwich! So I ask once again with politeness and they scramble to figure out what the issue is and they finally tell me they don't have Ham! WTF! Why didn't they just tell me that in the beginning and I wouldn't have ordered anything at all. There was no apology just that's how it is. What happened to Buisness like this valuing there costumers!"}
{"text":"Humanitarian wrap with extra veggies filled my tummy hole today and both my tummy and I were happy for that! Quinoa, hummas, veggies, pesto, feta on a sundried tomato wrap. Super good! I have been here a few times now and the only reason for the loss of star is that their parking spot has potential to be a nightmare during busy times.   I have had their hummus plate and kombucha on previous trips and both were wonderful! The hummus is much more flavorful than I have had at other places and the veggies on the wrap and the plate have always tasted fresh and crisp. My dude loves their chicken salad and swears by it AND was totally jealous I went for lunch without him.   I am definitely enticed to frequent here more regularly knowing their effort toward sustainable practices seem legit, my lunch was given in a paper wrap without a plastic bag and I dig that! They say their produce is organic or locally sourced when available which is super stellar as far as I'm concerned.  I haven't yet tried their breakfast burritos or any of the bowls but it certainly gives me something to look forward to."}
{"text":"I have visited the location in South Scottsdale multiple times now and I love it! Same great menu here only, or is such a larger location! Very open and a bit fancier.   I decided to try something I haven't tried yet and I am very glad I did. I know, it's  after 5 pm but I went for the Oatmeal their way because, why not? When breakfast is always available to order, sometimes you want breakfast.  It was quinoa, honey, bananas, berries, coconut milk (option) and a sprinkle of oats. The kiddos grabbed the quesadilla option and both seemed to enjoy it.  The dish went well with my delicious vegan buzz shake. I just totally love this establishment and the concept and the staff. The staff are always super chill and friendly.  Oh and the tunes are always in line with a good vibe!"}
{"text":"Wait took FOREVER, and parking is a bear. Bottom line, I won't be going back here on my lunch break....   which they made me late for."}
{"text":"They're breakfast sandwich is amazing. They also have really great tea.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie frittata, it was great! Everything about it was perfect. Flavor of the pesto sauce was delicious, all toppings spot on. Prices are very reasonable here. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to other Yelpers who said that it was a good spot to eat. It's a very small place, but the food quality was AMAZING! I got a chicken panini, my wife got a turkey club (which we shared with one another) and the kids got a chicken quesadilla. Had I known that I'd have been hitting up a non-franchize coffee house I'd have skipped the morning coffee and gotten it there. If their coffee is as good as their food, Wow! Customer service was great and everybody there had a big smile on their face. The only thing that could be a problem is parking if they're busy. Few spaces and the inside was small as well. Well worth it though!"}
{"text":"This is a very small location. Parking is a challenge. The drive thru is packed! The nuts n berries salad was perfect. It was very fresh and tasty. The goat cheese, walnuts, and berries were a perfect compliment to each other. The veggie delite wrap was very flavorful and filling. The inside is small and very noisy but they have a patio as well. Very healthy and quick spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Free refills on iced coffee!!! Amazing breakfast sandwiches and it's good for you. Parking is super hard to find, you're better off parking down the street and walking. Service is really fast and staff is very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I totally loved this place, I have burnt out the fruit/cheese/nut salad for myself cuz I keep ordering it, but i just had to again.  The berries were amazing and sweet, the nuts were sooo yummy, creamy goat cheese, it was great.  The hubby had a tuna sandwich, and I stole as many bites as I could it was soooooooooo good!! The price was GREAT! The customer service was totally nice.  I can't wait to go back and try the cali breakfast club, the man salad, maybe a bowl."}
{"text":"Ok not gonna lie!! I don't cook!! I know they are sick of seeing my face but I go here 6 days a week.  No joke!!! I can even get my dog doggie bags which they love!!! I get the tuna melt and mushroom soup! I haven't had one bad thing here!!! Seriously try it!!!"}
{"text":"I blinked & I missed it - it's tiny but has a lot of food options to offer. I got a vegan chocolate protein shake & it was a wonderful way to start my day. Love that such yummy fresh food can come through a drive thru!"}
{"text":"The drive through lady wasn't friendly after she looked at the receipt to find out how much I tipped her. 15% gives you a shitty attitude nowadays."}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, breakfast food. Not sure why this is such a novel idea.    So scrumptious- I crave it even when I'm not in a big hurry. Their breakfast burritos are great. So good that I don't think I've ever ordered anything else. I need to branch out."}
{"text":"We LOVE D'lish! The food is fantastic and the staff is awesome. We are trying to make our way through the entire menu but everything is so good we get stuck on one item for quite a while. We go several times a week and tell all our friends and clients to visit D'lish. A great gem that everyone should try. The burritos are insanely good!"}
{"text":"This place had a great wrap but they have no chips for a side. Clean and very pretty atmosphere though. Definitely was fast and good to grab on the go."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. Both locations feature good service and fast, clean food. I recommend the Breakfast Buzz, Cali Club, and Traditional Burrito for first-timers. They will also take one-off requests such as for a BLT or something along those lines. Again, very friendly people that really take care of you."}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite breakfast spot. I visit at least once a week. The breakfast buzz is phenomenal and their breakfast sandwiches are all filling and non-greasy so you never feel less than awesome after eating one."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The California breakfast club is amazing!!  Love it had a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try out D'lite as I pass by there almost every day. I ordered the signature California Club breakfast sandwich and was significantly underwhelmed. The flavors did not mesh well in my opinion. The Nitro Toddy had good flavor, but in my 32 ounce cup there was probably 5 ounces of actual coffee because it was over packed with ice. My husband got the same order so for $30 it was not worth it. We could spend $30 at any other breakfast spot and get a lot more food and coffee."}
{"text":"This place is very casual and has great staff! The food is amazing a must try! Everyone was so kind and happy to be there. I had a traditional burrito with avocado. If you haven't been to D'lite and like healthier alternatives to fast food this is the place to go. They have a drive through and walk ins."}
{"text":"This little place has some unique and delicious menu items.  I had az burrito and tried the house frittata. They were both very good. The orange glorious smoothie was just ok."}
{"text":"I just found this great little spot on Scottsdale Rd. called D'Lish, and that is just what it is - mmmmm. And the best part is, the food is healthy! I loved it so much I went back the very next day.  I talked to the pretty girl at the counter and I found out that they started as a coffee shop and have been adding more food items to the menu. It's owned by this really cool young couple and you instantly become a part of the family when you come inside. But if you're on the go, there is a drive-thru! Also, free WiFi internet!  I had the california club which has eggs, turkey, pesto, avocados and cream cheese (and maybe some other good stuff) on a low-carb bialy bagel. I also tried the kombucha, an interesting alternative to coffee that will really pop open those eyes for the day.  Whether you're on the go or you want a mellow atmosphere to read, talk, drink coffee, make friends, eat good food, D'Lish is your new hang out."}
{"text":"It's an ok sandwich. Rather bland. Could not taste any of the supposed pesto. Small. Most certainly not worth $7.25. Won't go back. I think the locals must be starved for half-decent food to attract the reviews it has. Very emu deserving. Should be a 3-star rating at best."}
{"text":"First timer here today. I ordered 2 different sandwiches and I have to mention they were really good and delish on my taste scale. I have to note though I had a headache after eating and don't know if its the ingredients they use or any MSG... I think they use weed in the ingredients hahaha..."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a healthy breakfast.  So far everything I have tried has been good, especially the breakfast buzz.  I am hooked and would recommend everyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and kids and we thoroughly enjoyed our food!!  Everything was fresh and I was pleasantly surprised with the portion sizes.  Service was spot on and they were very friendly.  It was the first day they were open so we did have to wait for our food a little longer than the norm (just a little), but it's their first day people, lol.  We will definitely be back.  Welcome to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best place on earth. A breakfast buzz everyday was needed when I stayed there. Please for the love of god open more."}
{"text":"Aptly named! We shared the veggie burrito and the az burro. Both were fresh and delicious.   And the other yelpers were correct: great coffee!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and the food was excellent! The workers were friendly and food was ready fast! Such a cute coffee shop and cafe to hang out at for a healthy breakfast or lunch! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"1. No bathroom or better still, it is inside the dive bar 2 doors down ....  2. Ordered the Oatmeal m, which reads great on the menu, using quinoa instead of oats :) but is served as some sort of soupy substance slopped together w/ out much care Also, they nickel and dime you and then upsell you because they are out of the Rice milk for 50cents extra and have to give you coconut milk instead for .75cents. Just the principle if you are out of a product it's not the customers fault so dont pass on the charged to them, makes me question just how cheap your kitchen quality is....  Put out a sign that you have no bathrooms and uour out of a certain item etc place just wreaks of lazy, sloppy, cheap. Welcome to Scottsdale, AZ. NOTE! Owner reached out, apologized and explained the bathroom situation and felt that their heart is in the right place and all. That said, strongly feel their bathroom situation should be clear on some sign before ordering and update the menus to better reflect what's being served and for how much. Have no probs paying just don't like feeling I'm being duped by some conflicting policy/ menu..."}
{"text":"There's simply nothing else out there like this place. Healthy fast food that tastes amazing and has friendly service to go along with it. If you try to eat clean and live a healthy life, you've found your food mecca here."}
{"text":"The food here is so good!  I love the breakfast sandwich california club!  I wish the restaurant was bigger, it's not really comfortable to have a meal with people there, so we usually just go drive thru.  Everyone is super friendly.  Great local place!"}
{"text":"This place is super delicious. A bit pricey, but worth it. Plus, their coffee beverages are super strong, just the way I like them."}
{"text":"Yes, I will pile on.  Hipster inspired decor and attitude and delicious and unique breakfast.  We shared the \"our way oatmeal) which is made with quinoa/fresh fruit and we opted for the almond milk.  My GF got the breakfast club and I tried the AZ burrito (which I pronounced the AS-burrito, or the A-Z burrito).  Both were fresh and had such interesting ingredient combinations that made things so tasty.  I'm not sure why anyone would go to some big chain place when the food is fairly priced and so delicious here.  Wished I had this place locally."}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee/breakfast/lunch spot. All the food on the menu is super delish! (Hence the name) I love their turkey sausage breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwiches are good also. It is always busy so keep in mind it will take awhile waiting at the drive-thru, but, that shows how good the food is! They are fast and efficient at getting your order in as timely as they can by having car hoppers take your order in advance at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Dear D'lish.  I love your food, but your BLENDER makes way too much NOISE!!!!!! I guess I will only do to go from now on."}
{"text":"I loved the original D'lite on Scottsdale Road but this one is BIGGER and BETTER!  I brought my coworkers here last week for a healthy lunch. We all loved it! I love how spacious this new location is and they have an expanded menu! The drive-thru option will make quick lunches or breakfast on the go a breeze! I have had many veggie burgers (some good, some bad) and I was super impressed with D'lite's. It was not mushy and had tons of flavor with the mushrooms, pesto, and cucumber sauce. I can't wait to try some of the other new menu items they have. This place is great for everyone wanting a lighter lunch-- vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim for a quick bite before my yoga class. I was able to get something very fast and filing and delicious. I literally asked for bread, avocado and tomato and they delivered! I will be back to actually try a full meal. The menu looks well thought out and I love how they use organic and local ingredients as much as possible. Definite bookmark for me!"}
{"text":"This place is busy no doubt, and parking challenging but worth it. The morning buzz is awesome and I have thought of driving 8 hours just to get one again..its that good!"}
{"text":"Truly enjoy this little spot...my daughter and I go after our morning workout...my only complaint is that they don't have any nutritional information...:-((...otherwise I would give it 5 stars..."}
{"text":"I have finally had both breakfast and lunch here, and as every other review and all of their marketing dictates, it's a fast healthy option in a land of fast food and fried disgusting crap. The wrap was fresh and great size and even distribution of ingredients. The cactus iced tea is awesome! To everyone complaining about the price, go eat off the dollar menu and shut up because healthy fresh ingredients come at a cost in the country at no fault to this establishment. I have zero complaints and happy to pay their prices."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Buzz is an excellent example of good milkshake engineering.   First off, there's just one size. That means only one method of preparation. It's nice not to regret ordering a size too big or too small. The cup is transparent so you can gage your consumption and not find out you're running low when the straw starts making that horrible inconsistent slurping sound. You have a good view of what's in there, you're not left in the dark blindly, dredging the bottom trying to pick up any last remnants.  The straw is big and strong enough to handle the shake and doesn't bend flat in your mouth under pressure like it would at Sonic or McD's. The Shake has the right consistency so you don't drink it too fast. On the other hand, it isn't so dense that your face goes turquoise and your eyes vacuum back into your head.   There are no cumbersome doodads like choc chips, ice or cookie that could obstruct the entrance to the straw preventing the flow of shake.   Lastly, the menu says it has vitamins,  proteins and fruits so you feel like you're making a healthy choice. As long as I BELIEVE it's good for me, I'll be ok right guys...?  I can understand why D'lish is voted so high. California Club is a nice sandwich and service is pleasant, but the milkshake, oh yeah, the milkshake is really quite good."}
{"text":"THE WORST. The service here is bottom of the barrel.  Shame on me for not learning the first time. They are slow, unorganized and rude. I can make my own smoothie or salad without the unnecessary hassle. One time they only took exact change. Every other time WRONG order! I had the drive thru sliding glass door slammed in my face. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick yet amazing breakfast, just come on over to D'lish! We were on vacation and wanted to have breakfast on our way out, SO GLAD we pick this place. I got the Cali club with a smoothly. The pesto on my sandwich seriously brought it to another level lol. So good... Wish we had a place like this in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"BEST BLACK BEAN BURGER EVER!! The Early Bird Burger is honestly amazing. It's so huge, but I ate it all and still felt great! I can't wait to come back and try more off the menu!! We need more heathy fast food options like this place! I'm a fan for sure."}
{"text":"Have yet to try something that isn't \"d'lish!\" Protein shakes, breakfast buzz, every breakfast sandwhich, just all super yum"}
{"text":"I had the \"low carb\" which consists of a slice of cheese, an egg, and a hash brown patty on top of a bed of greens and vinaigrette. Not sure of the nutritional content of such a mixture but I can tell you that it tastes damn good.   Unfortunately it's just a really, really small building that is ALWAYS busy. Not to mention that they have an industrial mocha-mixing machine that will give you tinnitus in 5-10 minutes.   The price is right, and all my friends say the smoothies are fantastic. If I want a late breakfast (because you'll be waiting any time before 11) that I can feel great about, D'lish is in the top 3 for sure."}
{"text":"LOVVEEEEEE the food here but I almost hate coming by just for the fact that they literally have the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life. Such a shame, they have so much potential."}
{"text":"If I lived here I would definitely be coming here often. $6.25 for a veggie burrito. If you're from California this is a spot to stop at."}
{"text":"Got the california club breakfast sandwich and it was awesome!!! Would like to try some other stuff on the menu but were only out here for a little while. Wish they had one in east mesa!!!  Clean facility and friendly service."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in how healthy D'Lite claims to be. I asked for the four berry smoothie without the banana and I came to find out the the rest of the smoothie is just a juice purée with ice. ...how is that a smoothie? Or healthy? The purée content is full of sugar. It makes me question the rest of their drinks and how much of those are just purées as well."}
{"text":"Location is great and the size and parking lot are finally not cramped like the other locations. The staff was really friendly and helpful and explained what exactly goes in their vegan breakfast buzz. They are having a serious fly issue inside the restaurant. It was a nuisance as there were so many flies inside. I won't be back if that issue isn't addressed and fixed."}
{"text":"I got the croissant sandwich and the buzz (a chocolate/coffee/protein smoothie). Didn't take super long after ordering and tasted great...pesto is a nice touch. Parking was atrocious, you have to get creative. Many people seemed to be ordering the burritos (and they also look great), definitely trying them next time."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!  The food is great and the people are really friendly!  There are a few issues I must call to your attention.  1.  The place is very small.  2.  The drive through is so busy, at times the line goes out to the street.  (Scottsdale Rd)  3.  Because the inside is small, it can be very noisey when they are making smoothies.  4.  They do not have a location in Gilbert.  :o)   None of these are deal breakers, that is why I still give this place a 5 star review.  If you are looking for a place off the beaten path, with healthy choices, this is a must!"}
{"text":"Drive thru deliciousness!!! Please put one in south Chandler so I can fix my lunch time cravings. Super cute decor, great service and perfect menu. I loved my egg pesto sandwich. The bacon was perfect. Fresh brewed green tea topped it off."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's so cute and leaps and bounds better than what it once was.. I love their soy dirty chai! So good. When they first opened they told me they'd have more vegan options soon.. boo, still lookin' to see when that will happen.  Love the drive-thru on a busy day."}
{"text":"Cutesy place with fresh ingredients.  We had the burritos and oatmeal which were very unique - a good thing.    Love the quaintness and outdoor seating.  Very difficult to park and the back has an interesting smell.  Avoid the bathrooms but go there for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a long time and finally was able to visit this morning since I was in the area. To my surprise, I walk in to a cute and modern coffee spot. I walk up to the counter and the cashier didn't give off a friendly vibe. I ordered the California Club and a small vanilla latte with almond milk. She gives me my order number and I guess I just have a seat. I just felt awkward and out of place the whole time I was there waiting for my food. Another employee gives me my food and my coffee and I leave.   When I get back to my office, I take a sip of my vanilla latte. It lacked flavor... and the California Club was okay. I'm not sure if I like the cream cheese in a California Club but I ate half of the sandwich. Food and coffee were okay, service was less than okay but overall, three stars."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz is extremely good with protein and espresso in it. Perfect meal to start your day for a light eater, the California club is extremely good too. All of their dishes are top notch, expect a long line for they drive through until 12:00"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You can tell by the constant line of cars in the Drive-Thru. Considering the price and quality of food it's more than worth the wait. I get either the AZ burro or the California Club. It's honestly a travesty more restaurants don't serve breakfast food all day."}
{"text":"I ordered the SW Bowl.. It tasted pretty good... but smallest portion I've ever seen for something that costs $10 a plate.. It was 45 min before closing so I wonder if that was why.. ahh well.."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and I have tried the breakfast buzz, dirty chai latte, and the AB&J. All are delicious and the staff is very nice, I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very good kombucha, good coffee, delicious food and fair prices. Local produce, organic food. Yeah, I like this place."}
{"text":"Very cool, delicious, organic/local options, original and fun... Plus service from a bunch of cute, down to earth guys= Awesome in my book. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Love the AZ Burro! I love going places where the staff is so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I hate that I'm writing this because the food and service are always stellar, but the staff was not kind to me on my last run. Rating 5 stars because 1 bad experience shouldn't ruin the chain of positive feedback. My last experience was disappointing in many ways, I wont be back."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this morning as an Arizona tourist.  I got the vegetarian burrito with avocado and put a little sriracha sauce on it.  It was fantastic!  I went in really wanting just some scrambled eggs or an omelet, which wasn't exactly what they offered, so i got this instead.  I am quite picky and not an easy mind changer, but I'd like to go back tomorrow to get the exact same thing.  I wish this existed closer to where I live (Colorado).  It was a little loud in the store itself, but its because it was a weekend morning during breakfast hours.  I'd recommend this place highly!  The also had free additions to coffee such as soy milk and flavors, which is a greatly appreciated touch."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place one Saturday morning and now I'm obsessed! Amazing healthy menu with great smoothies and coffee too. Don't let the long lines derail you, they move fast and it is totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast drive through I have ever been to. This place is not your fast food junk. Healthy food that competes with a sit down restaurant, but you don't need to get out of your car. Service has always been super!"}
{"text":"The AZ breakfast burrito with the side salsa is so scrumptious. This place is a must try for a delicious breakfast while visiting Scottsdale! 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Well, I ordered the hummus plate. And while it was good hummus, I got maybe 1/4 cup of it. And none of the cucumbers the menu promised. Other veggies and bread, but certainly way too much for the teeny amount of hummus. 2 stars for good hummus, but service was slow, although they seemed to have 10 people working there."}
{"text":"A little small inside, but the food was delicious. The california club is made fresh and is amazing. I recommend getting it on a croissant, but I'm a sucker for anything on a croissant. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, fast breakfast."}
{"text":"Sometimes I like it Hot and Dirty, and no one gives it to me better than Kyle and Chad.   I'm talking Chai's people, get your mind outta the gutter! ;-)   Seriously you need to try a Dirty Chai Latte!  And if your not the type to want to hang around for meaningless small talk after you get it dirty, they have a drive thru for your convenience!"}
{"text":"Having visited D'lish two separate times now it's safe to say I have built myself a more than fair opinion of place. It's also safe say D'lish is looking to be major hotspot of mine in the coming months! With the right mindset I know you will enjoy it here too.  I would imagine many passers by give D'lish an unapologetic look. The truly lackluster curb appeal reeks with the facade of a failed and dirty restaurant. Keep in mind the word facade though. D'lish makes up for its looks in what it cooks.  Health is the focus here. Minimal portion sizes and apparently organic/natural ingredients are meant to keep even the more hearty choices at a low health concern. The burgers (what I ordered on my first visit) are meatless. Instead a wonderfully blended patty of quinoa and black beans is served between artisan bread and a slew of great tasting condiments and toppings. The \"Top Notch\" burger is my personal favorite however many prefer the healthier option with pesto on it. Either way your taste buds will thank you!  Breakfast burritos seem to be a popular item on the menu. Hence my choice in ordering one during my second visit. It's a no-frills burrito with hardly a garnish in sight, but with such high quality ingredients being cooked with careful skill and precision nothing stands in it's way to becoming the perfect breakfast meal.   Try the coffee and tea too! Their dirty chai is one of the best I've ever had.   Take heed, D'lish is EXPENSIVE for what you're getting. A burger is $8.50. No fries. No salad. No drink. In fact, buying a medium dirty chai tea will run you a hefty $4.75. Health is the key at D'lish, but the almost $14 price tag just does not make it plausible for a college student such as I to make frequent visits, especially if the portions are so minuscule. An unfortunate setback in an otherwise fairly perfect experience.  Try it out for yourself though! Maybe the price won't bother you as much as it did me."}
{"text":"Shockingly good. Extreeeeeeemely loud inside when they make the shakes, which is often. Bring earplugs while eating their excellent food."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz is a must.  It is what I need to start my day. Their food is great too for lunch would recommend the chicken breast naked panini. Would also recommend the green lemonade with the house style burger."}
{"text":"Normally long lines are frowned upon but in this case it doesn't bother me because the place is that good and it's worth the wait. Incredible food and amazing service-I always go thru the drive-thru with my dog and they always offer him a treat! And I love getting my puppers the homemade dog food, the basmati rice and roasted turkey breast, which is literally good enough for humans to eat. Favorite breakfast menu item is the California club. Favorite drink is the iced dirty chai tea latte with almond milk. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the breakfast club but I wish it had avocado, it would be so bomb! I tried the breakfast buzz this time and it was delicious. I highly recommend eating here if you want a healthier alternative."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place for fast healthy food. The fact that I don't have to get out of my car means I can roll up looking like sh*t and still get my fix of healthy food   You can never go wrong with the almond buzz (no chocolate syrup). It honestly tastes the same without the chocolate syrup.   The Cali club (no meat) is my go-to for breakfast. Get a side of the chipotle aioli! The humanitarian veg supreme is my go-to lunch!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty dry and bland food for the price (for two people you WILL spend at least $20). The food isn't bad... It's just that it's pretty uninteresting. But if you want to pay a premium for a health moniker this is your place. Not for me tho."}
{"text":"This place is the best... I have been saying for years I don't understand why there is not more healthy food readily available. I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and got the \"breakfast buzz\" protein shake. It is sooooo delicious. Everyone that I have bright to try the \"breakfast buzz\" is instantly hooked. Today I tried the turkey club which was also fantastic. I highly recommend this place. The staff is always so friends and helpful... The drive thru makes it very convenient."}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago to pick up some coffee and the Arizona Burro. I went through the drive-thru and there were tons of flies flying in and out of the open drive-thru window (and into my car as well) and landing in the open peanut butter container I could see. Having flies everywhere is not a good sign of cleanliness at all. This is awful."}
{"text":"The California Club and Breakfast Buzz are both amazing"}
{"text":"Looking for something quick, yet healthy, and delicious?? This place has a drive through which is convenient for anyone on the go! Although it's not as much room as the tempe location when it comes to the drive through...customer service has been great & they are always attentive/ to what you want! Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Delicious croissant sandwich and coffee! Tiny place but with a drive through, seems like a local favorite. Speedy and friendly service."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by the food and customer service here...I got the vegan quinoa burger with the mushrooms and cream sauce.  Super yummy, but what's better is that it was yummy drive thru food!  My kidlet was with me and I couldn't find anything kid-like on the menu.  When I got to the window, I asked if they could make him a PBJ and give us a side of broccoli.  \"Of course!\" was the reply and I was instantly in love!  Yea for yummy drive thru and healthy kid drive thru food too!"}
{"text":"Drive through vegetarian? Drive through healthy kid options like a PB&J? Smoothies? My kid is asleep in the backseat and I'm hungry for something tasty, healthy and quick? YES please!  Before you get up to the window, there will be an actual person that comes to your car and gets your order...very nice when you have 20 questions about the menu.  And yes, they have meat options too!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a fast drive-through place that actually sells healthy food.  I can't wait to go back to try the entire menu.  My boyfriend and I both got breakfast burritos on a morning when we were feeling particularly hung over, but mustered up enough energy to get in an awesome workout and run up Camelback. After our run we stopped into this place. The burritos were perfect size, not loaded up with greasy cheese or meat, but filling in a way that didn't weigh you down.  After this outstanding breakfast we're definitely going to have an awesome day!"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and both times I found the food to be just OK and the service to be not so OK. Both times I went through the drive thru and both times the person waiting on me was less than helpful. When I got to the window this last time he just stood there talking to someone behind him for quite awhile, while I was holding my money out the window. Finally he turned around and grabbed the cash. I usually drop in a dollar or so when there is a tip jar out, but this time I decided not to. I took my change and he stood there looking at me and finally just shut the window. Another person later handed me my order. WTH?? I get better service from the 16 year old in the drive thru at my local Carls. And I feel much more appreciated as a customer!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is great, and its always what you expect every time...consistently. Thats why I love this place and thats it!  First timers should try a Breakfast Buzz and a California Club. You will not be disappointed.  Customer service is decent here at best. The massive hole in the driveway is pretty annoying. It could definitely damage your car if your low on coil overs.   Aside from that I'll probably still make the 25 minute drive here because its the closest one. Awaiting one to open in Chandler :)  Customer service 3/5 Food Price 2/5 Food Quality 5/5"}
{"text":"I'm torn....it's probably more like a 3.5.   I do see a lot of fans with 5 star ratings and I appreciate the loyal following D'Lite obviously has.     The menu is focused on 'healthy' and although they serve breakfast and lunch all day, it's a pretty small menu.   Re the sandwiches we tried, the portions of protein were fine but there was very little produce included (the Club had one or two thin tomato slices and a smear of avocado; the chicken panini said it has tomatoes but I didn't notice any); the bread is also on the dry side.  The mushroom soup was good, albeit a tad salty.    If I went back, I'd try something other than what we ordered, maybe the California Club breakfast sandwich which sounds like a better balance of flavors.  The ambiance is just neutral.   It's clean and bright but it's not the type of place you want to stay long at....eat and go...unless you get one of the leather chairs up front.  The servers are very pleasant.    The price point is higher than I thought the experience provided; we were just under $30 for 2 sandwiches, 1 ice tea, and 1 small bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Had az burro and California club both really good!! We also got a cold frozen drink called the breakfast buzz that had mocha, peanut butter and banana (I did no bananas) that was really good!! Will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really cool local place, checked it out during Spring Training before heading to the Giants game. I read the great reviews so I got a little of everything to try it out: a soup, sandwich, and smoothie. The soup was excellent gourmet quality, on par with a top restaurant. The smoothie was excellent, very fresh and refreshing, more of the low-dairy, low-powder, high fruit type smoothie that is really cold and icey and has a sugary bite to it like you might make at home with a blender and some fresh fruit. On the sandwich I think I called a bad audible, as I read their cali club was great on my phone, then arrived to order and saw that included egg but I wanted lunch, so I switched to the turkey club. Although the turkey club had quality ingredients, I think the strong flavor of the whole wheat bread overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the turkey, which made the sandwich less flavorful overall. However, my friends said their sandwiches and coffee were great, and they made a good tuna sandwich. I think my friends and I will definitely return in future springs!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The breakfast buzz is to die for. I would love to start my day with this breakfast shake everyday. I usually get the croissant breakfast sandwich. And I have tried the California club too which is awesome. The atmosphere reminds me of SoCal - reggae music playing and just a laid back atmosphere. This place is always a good idea for hangover cures and for breakfast to go. It's so good I might even get it today for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buzz.  There is a reason every review mentions it.  It's that damn good.  Go there and buy a breakfast buzz.  NOW!  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the parking.  Yes, I understand there are some things you cant control.  At this point I think you are making enough money and you have a big enough brand that you can upgrade A) your location or B) buy out super burrito so you can use their parking lot.  It was understandable 3 years ago when you were just getting started, but it is now at the point where you guys need to do something about it."}
{"text":"Food's fresh and delicious, I always feel good after eating here lol. Will come back again and again. I only wish that they were open later."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and ordered the hummus plate and early bird burger.   The hummus: Soooo yummy!!! The pita bread is sooo warm and soft!!! Together they are perfect :) I could just eat a whole plate of just hummus and pita. I wish I could of just ordered a plate of hummus and pita without the vegetables. (Maybe I can...will need to ask next time)  Early Bird Burger: Was surprised it wasn't made out of meat, and instead some other super good stuff. It was really good, and the bun was very soft. I thought it was a little too spicy for me, and the burger fell apart easily, so I ended up eating it with a fork.   For two people, this filled us up. I would go back again, and maybe this time I'll try the southwest bowl!"}
{"text":"great place, way to expensive. i would recommend if you aren't eating on a budget. lower your prices and more people will come!"}
{"text":"I made my first-ever journey to D'lish this morning because I was aching to try the concept. Fast, fresh, drive-through breakfast? I loved it. As an aspiring locavore, I also appreciated the touted ingredients.   I ordered an almond milk latte and the veggie frittata. One reason I already love this place is because it is one of the few places near me that actually HAS almond milk. While the latte wasn't terribly hot, my tastebuds appreciated the flavor regardless. The frittata was flavorful and a unique combination of flavors. There was just a little too much pesto, which made the underlying toast soggy. Service was excellent; everyone there seemed happy despite working on labor day. Portion was perfect. Overall, my meal satisfied and I would return.  A few words about this place, not necessarily overtly negative: first, this is NOT a cheap place. My latte and meal were over $11. No value menu here. Granted, I totally get it - you're getting real, unadulterated food, not lab-generated franken-fuel. Just a fair warning. Second, this is not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I think it took about 8 minutes to order and get my food. Not bad, but bear that in mind if you're scrambling to nosh before hitting that lovely morning commute.  Overall, great place and I will return, again and again."}
{"text":"D'lish doesn't need another review, but I love it so much that I couldn't resist.    If I can help you out with anything, the key is to drench their sandwiches/wraps/flat breads in their chipotle aioli - game changer.  Makes their super delicious food even better.    While it's 'fast food,' be prepared to wait as everything is made to order.  Totally worth it, and you will be occupied by reading the rest of the menu items, plotting your next order a week later."}
{"text":"Two words.  BREAKFAST BUZZ.  If you haven't had one, get it now.  I am addicted.  Espresso, peanut butter, chocolate & banana in one drink?  Count me in.    The rest of the menu is so great as well.  A bit pricey, but it is worth it.  Some more of my favorites:  sun dried tomato bialy, iced chai, frittatas, & the veggie d'lite.  I still have so much to try...& I will, it is just a little out of the way for my daily routine.  I wish they were open later...I crave one of their salads or a wrap after my evening workout, but i'll forgive them.  Another plus: they use a lot of organic & local ingredients & recycled products.   I'm a fan of the drive thru, even though you may as well park & go in instead of idling in your car while they make your food!  (just get out...it's better for everybody!)  The guys who work there are awesome too.  Basically, d'lish is the food I wish I could make for myself!  I might just go get something now...."}
{"text":"I was on my way to the airport to go back home, so I stopped by this lovely place for breakfast. Before D'Lish, I had never thought to try make quinoa in the morning as I would oatmeal. It was so unique and delicious, as was the amazing egg sandwich and coffee. The guys were incredibly nice and friendly. I wish this was in Austin!"}
{"text":"When in Scottsdale, I honestly could eat here for every meal.   The breakfast burritos deserve 5 stars by themselves! Each variety of the breakfast burrito is incredible. And, I would highly recommend accepting their recommendations on additional fillings. They have yet to steer me wrong!   The coffee is pretty good too. Being from New England (where we have perfected iced coffee), I am always a little skeptical trying the iced coffee. D'Lish has my favorite iced coffee in AZ. (Yes, I'm including the local Dunkin' Donuts franchise here).    Until the next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will pitifully attempt to re-create D'Lish's amazing breakfast burrito here in RI...."}
{"text":"TASTY. Had a frittata, freakin' BOMB. And cheap! That's my stahl (style).  Had some crazy chocolate/coffee drink that was off the hook!"}
{"text":"I order the same thing every time, the California Club. It's not only delicious but a seriously beautifully crafted sandwich. Brought it in to work one day and everyone that walked by kept asking where I got that sandwich from!  I've tried the orange glorious before it was good as well!  Service is always great no complaints on that part. I just wish they had a location in Chandler I can only come here when I'm in the area which isn't often."}
{"text":"I ordered the California breakfast club at the recommendation of the man taking my order, and it was SUCH a good call. It was fresh, flavorful, and completely satisfying.  The bread was tasty and not at all soggy-like I seem to keep getting with similar places around here.  The sandwich's fixings both appeared and tasted freshly made, which is a game changer with this type of faster-slow food genre.   The employees were really friendly and even gave my dog a bone while we waited on our order.  Although it took longer to get the food through the window than say McDonald's or Burger King, the wait time was quite minimal for the quality of food I received to-go.   I'll certainly be back. Thanks for a great start to my day & week!"}
{"text":"My sister lives in Tempe, so when I asked where we should take our mom for lunch, she suggested this place.  We all had the green berry tea, which was delicious--even unsweetened.  Everything on the menu seems healthy and friendly to vegans and gluten-free types alike.  I am neither of those things, but I like to have my options.  I ended up getting the kitchen sink salad, which had carrots, golden raisins, feta cheese, organic greens, and a bunch of other vegetables.  It was inexpensive for the heaping portions!  My only complaint would be, I could use a little more dressing, but I'm sure if you just ask they'd be happy to give it to you.  My mom had the California club, which looked huge and meaty (in a good way).  She loved it.  My sister had the nuts and berry salad... which I think I will DEFINITELY order next time.  It had raspberries, goat cheese, walnuts... oh my.  I tried it and it was AMAZING.    The staff was super friendly and courteous, pointing out how adorable my niece is (she really is).  We were in and out pretty quickly, and the facility was clean and sunny.  I like that they have a drive-thru... if I lived in town, I know I would take advantage of that!  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a healthy, fast restaurant and definitely found one. I ordered the chicken breast panini; it was delicious and the perfect size!  The drive thru was pretty quick (about 5-7 min) but I was unsure if I needed to tip since the restaurant is not really \"fast food\" - I still left $1 tip for a $7 sandwich just in case.  I'm looking forward to trying other menu items asap!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I see their tweets everyday, and last week I thought \"Today is the day Im finally gonna go\". Mistake.  I decided to go through the drive thru as their patio looked packed. I got to the speaker, ordered my sandwich (the club), and asked what sides they had since they were nowhere on the menu. The guy on the other end of the speaker sighed and said he'd be right out. Um ok... He came to my window and said \"Yeah we dont have them listed but people usually know.\" I explained that this was my 1st time there and he replied well we have chips and fruit and a little salad. I asked what kind of chips they had and he sighed and said Sun Chips \"What kind?\" \"All of them.\" \"French Onion?\" \"*sigh* Nope.\" I asked for whatever he had. He then said well the combo (again, not listed on the drive thru menu) comes w/ lemonade or iced tea. I gave him my choice and he said I was all set and off he went. Now, they were very, very busy so I dont fault them for my wait time at all. However, a couple of the guys that were working the lunch shift this day were so unprofessional. When I was at the window, after I had signed my receipt one of them hung out the window to have a shouting conversation w/ one of his friends that was leaving. As for the guy who took my order, I never saw him again. I got my food and left.  Let me tell you what I paid almost $10 for: a small lemonade, a bag of Sun Chips, and a tiny sandwich. Are you kidding me? I mean, I know theyre categorized as a healthy place, but this sandwich was about as small as a McDonalds hamburger, and unfortunately, not very tasty.  I dont think Ill be going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast buzz! Pretty much all I should have to say lol. Nothing on the menu here is bad. Amazing breakfast sandwiches and great lunch salads. Haven't had one bad thing ever. Recommendations from me are obviously the buzz, (I get mine with almond milk which makes it a little more sweet), California club breakfast sandwich, croissant breakfast sandwich, man salad and Portobello soup, but like I mentioned before you can't really go wrong with anything you order.  If I had to give a tip, I'd say if you haven't been here before you should try to park and go in so you don't back up the already long drive through line. Unless you scope out the menu ahead of time so you're ready to order."}
{"text":"I normally love D'lish's food. Sometimes portions or quality can be somewhat inconsistent, which is to be expected from a local place. However, I have been disappointed by the service lately at the Tempe location. Also, today I noticed the restaurant serving Pace salsa rather than their regular salsa, making my normal breakfast choice - the traditional burrito - something I could have easily made at home for a quarter of the price. When I asked about the reason for the change, the response was vague and no offer or apology for the grocery-store quality. I hope they can work on their service and go back to more local/fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for breakfast. A cozy little place, with very friendly and smiling persons. Their house coffee is fine, but will have to go back for a dirty chai. I had also a bagel (just like any other). A nice drive through, and a good alternative to start the day!"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday when they were having their grand opening 50% off all their menu items. It was packed and busy due to the special deal that day. Maybe they were understaffed or most of their people were in back trying to keep up with the food orders? but there was only one register open that day so it took awhile to get my order taken. There wasn't any open tables and they did have outdoor seating but it was a cold cloudy day so it was a little wait to get an open table. They were very quick to clean off any open tables which was great and made seating faster and easier. I ordered the southwest rice bowl and I thought the serving was a little small, but considering all the ingredients, it was probably a +500 calorie meal or so. (I sent an email to someone on their team and they said they are working on nutrition facts for their menu. This would be great for me since I do count my macros. They actually replied to my question pretty fast, which was pleasantly surprising. I don't think I will be coming back until they have their nutrition facts listed though so it's easier for me to watch what I'm eating). Anyways back to the dish, other than be a little on the small side, it was clean and fresh tasting with good flavoring. I do wish a little that I had tried a sandwich instead that day. My son had the kids quesadilla and he seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I would rate D'Lite and this is why. The sandwich was amazing, I loved every bite but it was hard to enjoy because the idiot that made it did not know that the bread goes AROUND the lettuce etc. It was the messiest sandwich I've ever eaten. I wanted to kill the person that made it!  However, I wouldn't hesitate to eat it again. Maybe the next person will make it right. Very delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with D'lish.    Lines can be outrageously long but it is worth it every time.  The inside is a bit tight but very doable.    Everything on the menu will leave you satisfied.   There is nothing like a breakfast buzz after a solid work out!"}
{"text":"Had some good coffee and heard the food was good. Maybe I'll try it next time. Service was great and price was right. Could use a good cleaning but they're pretty busy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Low carb breakfast? Yes, they got me- it's out of this world!  This savory breakfast has it all:  eggs, hash, avocados,  tomatoes, and greens- topped with a bit of pesto sauce & it's good for me? WHAT?  Yes, believe it.  The pesto gives the egg a nice balance of acidity. This is truly a well balanced breakfast.   Can't wait to try their shakes next time!"}
{"text":"Went here with family from out of town. They both had dietary needs that this place satisfied very well. I love that it has the drive thru option too. Only wish I lived closer so that I might eat there more frequently. Very cute and cozy atmosphere as well, but be warned the smoothie machine indoors can get loud."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove through this place today. I was skeptical on many levels. Healthy, quick, made from scratc with a drive thru don't normally go together but this place pulls it off. The parking lot is tiny so be prepared. The food is really good. I got the breakfast buzz drink and the California breakfast sandwich. Both were really good but it was too much to take on at one sitting. The drink was next level good. It is coffee, peanut butter, banana, milk, vitamins and ice. I could've gotten this one on its own and been perfectly content. The sandwich was really good as well. I'd get it minus cream cheese next time. The bread on the sandwich was phenomenal. Overall, I'll definitely go back. I'm pretty sure the Scottsdale location has been a few different places over the years but I'm pretty sure this place will stick. It was super crowded around 11:15 and for a healthy, quick, made from scratch drive thru it ticked all the boxes.."}
{"text":"What do you do with an old McDonalds when it closes?  Well you open a D'lite Healthy On the Go place! I like it.   I would have given them 5 stars but all i had here so far is a bagel and coffee. My raisin bagel was perfect and the coffee is good. Service was fast and server attitude was like going to Dutch Bothers - friendly and enthusiastic. And it was well priced.  Lets talk about atmosphere. I do not go to Starbucks because it is pricey, pretentious and full of people who like that. D'lite has couches with short tables, power and wify and you can get a bagel and coffee without learning a new vocabulary. Yea I know, that might just say more about me than Starbucks but I really felt more at home at D'lite.  I do not know if they cater but that kitchen is set up to manage some very big orders. In fact, if you are a caterer that needs kitchen facilities at night you might talk to them about it.   So if your are on Indian School some morning and you just want to pick up a bagel and coffee, stop in and say hello  to the staff, they will welcome you."}
{"text":"Best healthy breakfast place to go in old town. There is always a line but that breakfast buzz is worth the wait! They are also dog friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is really tasty ! My group of friends and I went to grab a quick bite to eat on the way to watch a game. The menu was simple, the service was quick, and everything was delicious. Their sandwiches are so good and its cheap. The whole group agreed that their sandwiches were awesome. I would definitely come back when i'm in the area and looking for a quick delicious and cheap breakfast!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in Scottsdale. California club and morning buzz are amazing . Plus this dude that does the drive thru is great and makes me laugh."}
{"text":"The first time I came I ordered an ice coffee then sat down with my shitzu while I waited and got asked to sit outside when it was 115 degrees, second time I ordered a hot chai and when I got it, it was luke warm. So today I wanted an ice coffee only to wait in the drive through for 20 minutes... I almost drove off. Couldnt believe I paid $6 for a medium iced toddy"}
{"text":"Can't say enough gold things about D'lish. I've been dozens of times and have yet to have an unpleasant interaction with a single employee; the service is as quick as it can be (considering the relatively small place gets packed with customers) and everyone is friendly. The food is also amazing; a breakfast buzz a day keeps the doctor away! Errr something..."}
{"text":"D'Lite is hands down my favorite brekky joint!! Everyone that works there is so down to earth and   friendly. The price point is pretty average but the food is sooo fresh and delicious. I love all their sandwiches and their \"breakfast buzz\" shake is to die for. I will remain a loyal customer of this place :)"}
{"text":"My second visit today was a good as my first! Yummy fast food & I don't feel bad eating it! Plus, it's great quality. Staff is friendly which is also a plus.  First time I went, I ordered a breakfast sandwich. Yummm. This time I ordered the Hummus Plate. It came with veggies and warm flat bread. Veggies were crispy, flat bread was soft, and hummus was smooth and creamy.  Only downside is that they're only open until 4 and their prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I love this place!! Where is my frequent flier punch card because I need one! I like all he food that I have tried and I like that you can drive thru and get a healthy meal. Their coffee is actually one of my favorite coffees, so delicious. They also have treats for your best furry friends at the drive thru window. We need these all over the valley!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It is small and the line is always long but it moves pretty fast. Everyone is super friendly and the food is fantastic! Highly recommended for healthy eating."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. In the time of ordering, three different people exchanged registers which resulted in my order being incorrect (as in 2 items for completely missed!). Not to mention no sauce was on my wrap...  What's worse is my wrap is 4inches long (my index finger is longer than half of it) yes I measured it. I have ordered it before and it has never been this small and for $8.50 I honestly expect more!"}
{"text":"I've been camped here working all day and I can say this place is awesome! Good wifi, great food and better service. Everyone is greeted with a smile and taken care of.  If you're tired of being stuck in a home office come work here."}
{"text":"Checked out D'Lish with Gabi and crew. Really cool space with super-efficient drive-thru and friendly staff.  I sampled the \"Breakfast Buzz,\" which is a delicious smoothie made with espresso, Nestle good morning mix, banana, chocolate, and peanut butter. The owner claims the Breakfast Buzz has restorative properties for those suffering from hangovers.  The coffee was also excellent. I'm 99% sure D'lish sources its beans from Echo Espresso on the west side.   Bonus: you can buy 160 ounces of coffee (in a disposable insulated box) for 20 bucks. That might be enough to get your group through a PowerPoint presentation or two."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, friendly staff, quick service, good coffee...great spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my third review ! I gave one more star because They have really done a good job on improving their customer service !! The staff is way more friendly . Keep up the good work !! The best Protein shake ever is here !!!"}
{"text":"Win win!!! If you are a regular of the Scottsdale location you will absolutely love this place !!! Why? Because the parking is huge yes that means no idiots blocking the road like they do in Scottsdale. There's a great fast drive thru !!! Plus friendly staff , and of course delicious breakfast buzzes !! Soo happy this place opened !!"}
{"text":"I've only got the vegan buzz here, but I love it! It's a small parking area, but the drive thru line goes pretty fast. I love having this healthy option as a quick drive through."}
{"text":"New favorite spot for quick and healthy food. The best eggwhite burrito and protein shake.  eat here 5 times a week, and I notice that the drive thru line is getting longer.  no longer a secret, the word is out about Dlish.    have not tried the dinner menu, but will soon.  Some great dishes."}
{"text":"I would really, really, really like to give this place a glowing review HOWEVER I have never in my life, in all the cities I've been to, eaten at a domestic restaurant that did not have a restroom for customers.     WTF!!!??!!!   Even in third world countries, you can slip someone $5 to use the restroom!   They'll even throw in some sheets of toilet paper...  I wish I had some of the juvenile attributes, I despise, in some of my more interesting friends.   I'd love to pull my pants down and pee on their patio."}
{"text":"I've been going to D'lish for years! It's a great local spot that serves on the go healthy food. It's best known for their Breakfast Buzz morning smoothie with espresso, peanut butter and chocolate. I usually get their traditional burrito or Oatmeal their way made with quinoa! All their items are listed gluten free or vegan for customers who have diet limitations!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed that I drove all the way to D'Lite after checking their hours online only to find a closed for summer hours sign taped to the window. It's not hard to update your hours online. Note to everyone: they close at 2pm during the summer."}
{"text":"Does it get any friendlier than this?  (Must be the sunshine and glorious temps in the winter- everyone in Scottsdale seems happy- and this placed topped out the smile & hospitality meter.)  Love the Buzz.  How can you go wrong with peanut butter, espresso, chocolate, and banana whipped up into a breakfast smoothie?  Fair-trade locally-roasted beans?  Kudos.   Ate in one morning with friends- cozy little indoor & outdoor spaces.  Had the low-carb breakfast- a pesto-ed fried egg salad and it was excellent.  So good I had to go back the next morning before flying home.  Tried the drive thru and grabbed a breakfast burrito (add some sausage & avocado for a cali-flair).  Perfect.  This healthy fast food movement needs to make its way West..  Come to San Francisco, D'Lish!"}
{"text":"D'Lite is the real deal when it comes to healthy, organic, nutritious foods. They've got soups, salads, sandwiches, and smoothies for every palate, with a fresh interior design that invites you to sit down, relax, and take some \"me-time\" after the days events. Friendly, competent staff and an attractive fitness minded customer base make this the natural choice for your post workout meal. Bring a friend! You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Hangin' out at D'lish this AM,working the Wi-fi, drinking the java and enjoying the chill dance track soundtrack. Had a good (not great) egg 'n' cheese, and the barrista is generous with coffee refills. Definitely worth a visit if you're in S. Scottsdale. Fresh bunch of folks in and around."}
{"text":"First time at D'Lish and I was quite D'ssapointed. I ordered (to-go) the quinoa bowl that comes with veggies and it came out soup style...which then exploded in my paper bag on the drive back to work. I ordered mine without cheese expecting the bowl to then be a vegan dish but it appeared to be full of cream! Ew! Why would I bother to ask them when ordering if their \"quinoa veggie bowl\" has cream in it? SO weird. I also ordered an iced green tea with some lemonade mixed in and it came out pink and tasting like sugar water. Ummmmm.... when does green tea look pink... This place is a nice concept but it's overpriced and lacks vegan options and I won't be going back for food. I do want to try their coffee so I'll be back to see how that goes. All in all, D'Lish left a lot to be D'sired in my opinion."}
{"text":"Every Sunday I travel 15 miles for the best coffee in AZ. I love D'Lish and I love to see a local restaurant do well. Thanks for opening your doors!"}
{"text":"The white guy behind the counter was kind of unfriendly when we came in, we hadn't done anything but walk in the door, hadn't even opened our mouths to order yet and the guy seemed like we were really putting him out by being there, but the Hispanic guy cooking and serving was really nice to us, which is what kept my husband from walking out on the bad first impression.  I'm glad we didn't leave cause the food was great.  I got the low carb breakfast and also sampled my husband's quinoa \"oatmeal\" (delicious with just the right amount of sweet and fresh fruit) and egg sandwich (cheese to die for and some very good chicken sausage).  My husband's complaint (beside the sort of assclowny guy behind the counter) was that the menu did not make clear that the egg sandwich was a fried egg rather than scrambled and that the oatmeal would be quinoa rather than regular oatmeal.  As we were sitting eating the CSA arrived with the days vegetable delivery.  Buying local from the farm?  No wonder it tasted so good."}
{"text":"I have been going here for as long as I can remember... ok, maybe not that long.  Early 2006?  I am guess what you would call a 'drive through regular'.  The Mocha Breve. It's not too sweet (a la starbucks) It's not too expensive (a la coffee bean and tea leaf) It is my perfect drink.   I stop by on my way to work (granted there is enough time and the line is not atrocious). It is manditory I go Saturday and Sunday mornings. I like to bring my dog - and he is always given a treat.    Because of D'Lish, my dog always expects to get a treat no matter where I take him in the car.  I go to the atm and he expects the machine to cough up a dog biscuit, I swear.    The coffee shop used to be called Daily Rush.  Many of the same faces are still around.  Rarely do I have to tell them what I want.  It's always the same: Mocha Breve 16 oz.  A couple times - they've seen me waiting a car or two back in the drive-thru line - my coffee is ready before I even pull up to the first window.   Yup, they get me.  For lunch - I love their soups in the fall, winter, and breezy spring.   Their tomato soup is perfect coupled with the grilled cheese.  I do recommend drinks only -  if you are doing drive through. If you require food - their is usually ample parking.  It takes some time.  A true testament to this place: It is one of the drawbacks of going on vacation.  I can never find coffee I like in other cities.  Daily Rush.. I mean, D'Lish is as good as it gets, in my opinion.  Cringing at the thought of ever-present starbucks.. vacation mornings make me long for home.  If you are in south scottsdale - I recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Love the place and food, plus the drinks are outstanding just wish the price were a bit more affordable."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go eat at when by ASU. Always good, consistent  and there is always good friendly service.   My favorites are the Breakfast Buzz, California club and the Man Salad."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe it took me this long to come here. There are two locations closer to my house but I met a friend here for a weekend brunch before work. I know this place is constantly busy with the amount of cars in the drive thru, so that's a sign of a good business. We dined on their patio which is dog-friendly, and we saw some dogs inside as well.  Love that their menu is simple with healthy options that encompass all dietary preferences. I chose their nuts n' berries salad which comes with strawberries, blueberries, walnuts, and goat cheese on a bed of mixed greens and raspberry vinaigrette. It was light and refreshing, just what I needed since I wasn't feeling so great. My friend ordered their low carb breakfast, which was my other choice and she enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying other menu items and may visit the drive thru if it's not terribly busy."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.  Had a crossant-wich.  Very tasty, came to me hot off the press. Not luke warm, freshly made which is nice!   Can definitely tell this is not your regular \"fast food\" joint.   However had a americano, a bit weak for my taste, considering I'm a Seattleite and huge coffee drinker.  But I'm still willing to give it 5 stars!  Must visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"D'lish is great, we all know this. However, I think it's about time they got a bigger/more accessible location. They are always so packed which is obviously good but sometimes the drive thru line is just ridiculous, especially when people are sitting with half of their car still in the road. Also....good luck parking anywhere in that parking lot when there is a line in the drive thru. You are trapped. But that's enough negativity... Turkey Club, Breakfast Buzz, D 'Veggie Bowl, Tuna Sandwich, Veggie Burgers, Low Carb Breakfast, Green Tea, the list goes on. They also make a mean Dirty Chai. I wish they were open after 4pm....I can't tell you how many times I've craved it and looked at the clock...right at like 3:55pm. I also like how they come out to the drive thru and get orders rather than waiting for you to pull up to the window that does speed things up a bit.....and the fact that I typically know 90% of the people waiting in line at the drive thru. Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"D'lish is my go to breakfast spot.  All the choices are healthy and you don't feel like a tub of lard after eating it.  I wish the drive through was a bit more accessible, but I'll take what I can get.  This place is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"D'lish is the best quick spot to get lunch without a side of coronary artery disease. Who would have ever thought that people would like healthy food coming through their car window!  Favorite things: The Orange Glorious. this my friends is new school orange Julius on steroids. all natural ingredients include an entire banana. so D'lish!  The California Club..phenomenal. like a flavor explosion in my mouth!   the staff is super personable and always chatty and friendly. I suppose when you take away the trans-fats, processed meats and general corporate shittyness of your average drive through food, everyone is just happier and better off!   my one and only gripe: they close pretty early, (4pm)  ive driven by a couple times for my black bean burger or chicken panini fix only to find they were closed for the day."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place to see if it was truly a healthy option. I am impressed not only with the food but the service as well. Place is clean. Had the vegan burrito and it was very good. I also had the berry smoothie and decided it was too sweet for me. They made me a green drink that was perfect!  I will be back sorry no pics ate it all!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy on Saturday morning, avoid the drive thru and parking lot and opt for dining in.    Great, cheappp $5 hummus plate with pesto, aggghhhh so good!   Soup was decent and drinks are popular and well made.   I will be back if Im in the Scottsdale area again soon!"}
{"text":"First time here- so good! I had the \"low carb bfast\" and my friend had the \"bfast club\". Both were filling and exceeded expectations. Good job D'lite! We also tried the green lemonade- also really good. Hint of sweetness that overpowered the garlic and ginger for me (probably not the best choice if you don't have much of either.) I couldn't really taste it, even tho girl taking our order said some people don't like it bc they could. Perfect choice for a healthy sit down or on the go brunch- will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I would give it five if they could figure out the damn parking.... sitting with the rear of your car on Scottsdale Rd is just plain scary!. Yet worth it. I have had several things here. I would say that the chicken Panini ranks up there. The food is fresh and local and all that, so driving by this place to stop at Mickey Ds or T-Bell is just plain crazy. You will spend the same and get high blood pressure. I also enjoy the veggie wraps on occasion. There is one with hummus that tastes unlike anything you have ever had from take out. If you eat your veggies, that is. They have meat eater food there, too. But when you go healthy, it seems better  to get some greens down the pipe!. Line of cars my only issue...dang."}
{"text":"The food is soo gooood and the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. Downside is that their parking situation sucks a lot. For driveup window orders you are often times stuck waiting in the middle of the road. They are busy AT ALL times soo no matter what time you come, or what day of the week it is, you will be waiting on the street for the drive thru window. Butttt they get things rolling pretty fast so not that bad. TURKEY CLUB AND BREAKFAST CLUB are delicious here!"}
{"text":"Best iced chai with coconut milk!!! I got the man salad and it was everything I could have asked for. Super quick and healthy!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place! They have excellent service and food AND offer Lots of gluten, dairy free and organic options!!! They were super kid friendly.  Oh and awesome music too! Yay Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been calling ahead to order an egg and cheese bialy to go for weeks now.  Their bialys are soooo yummy and the eggs are usually cooked perfectly!  I also like their salads, other breakfast sandwiches, low carb breakfast bowl, and southwest bowl.  We order lunch sometimes for our office from here as well.  They always get our orders right!  The final thing I'll mention is that I love that they offer doggy bags (leftover turkey and rice) for only $1.50 each!  I'll usually get these as a meal replacement for our pups when I want to treat them."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to feel good about your \"fast\" food...ie. the awesome protein burger w/pesto.  That made me revise my review and up a star...hadn't tried it before...what was I missing?!  This is a very nice deli and quick stop for a healthy munchie or tasty, cold ice tea on a warm Valley day.  Great outdoor space as well.  The vibe is casual hippie/hipster/health nut in a GOOD way.  My usual favorite for lunch is the cold tuna salad sandwich (NOT canned tuna) on wheat toast.  My breakfast fave changes, but with so many good options (burritos, sandwhiches, etc) I'm never disappointed.  Probably not the option for someone looking for pork, butter, grease-laden hangover breakfast.  But this place has cured an ill or two of mine..."}
{"text":"Small parking lot with an entrance that flows right into the drive thru line depending on time of day.  Problem is if people in drive thru dont hug the curb you can't get around them to park.  Almost as soon as you enter the parking lot from the East you will arrive at the drive thru order board.  If you're not familiar with this place you will completely miss your option to order. Parking is very limited to less than twenty spots. Menu isn't too complicated and really not much out of he ordinary. They have symbols beside every item that denotes vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free, protein packed, and balanced. Both entrees we ordered fell into the protein category. My sandwich was pretty good and only wish i could have had my eggs cooked to order.  I had a bite of my sons frittata and that was nummy and i will probably order it next time. Patio has more seating than there is inside.  Music is eclectic with jazz, funk, and a rap blended in which provides a more hip, youthful feel to the place -not that you need any more youthful and hip in an area that is so close to the college.  *g* Overall a decent change of pace and will probably come back again so i can try the frittata."}
{"text":"D'Lish is that total local spot that you keep to yourself. You don't want it to blow because its too perfect the way it is. All of the food is amazing, the management is awesome and they have some of the best coffee around."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! They do not have public restrooms though and the dine-in is very cramped. Food and service was great, though! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Well they got the name right with this place because it is DEEEELISH!  I've been here twice (it would probably be closer to 50 times, but I live in Tucson)... the first time I got the az burro,  the second time a croissant sandwich.  Both these things I feel like I've had a hundred times before... but somehow D'lish makes them taste 100x better!  Don't know what their secret is, but I'm lovin it!"}
{"text":"D'lish can be hit and miss, but when it's a hit, it is soooo good. I love their breakfast sandwhiches, and they usually have really good coffee. It gets really busy on the weekends, so prepare to wait a while if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning. If you ever drive by on the weekend and don't see a line, you owe it to yourself to pull off and get something to eat.   I typically get their egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and I'll add either bacon or chicken sausage. My wife loves the croissant sandwich, which has egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and pesto. We'll also typically get coffees or a blended protein drink or something.   It's a great place to come for breakfast and coffee, but at times, the wait is really long, and the food/service can suffer when it's really busy. I'll continue to go there pretty much every weekend. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent find here near my hotel. Lots food options and nice setting and seating for customers. Great service and all is just right. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Breakfast buzz. Maybe you shouldn't try it because of your inevitable addiction that will begin. A breakfast smoothie (milkshake?) with coffee, protein powder, chocolate syrup, milk, banana, and peanut butter. Unfortunately I have a hard time believing it is healthy because it tastes like a milkshake. D Lite also doesn't list nutrition facts and it's probably got a lot of sugar. Would love to see a healthier version maybe that includes spinach!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy \"fast food!\" Count me in! I came here for the first time with a couple friends upon their recommendation. I had the Man Salad because it was chock full of healthy protein (tuna, avocado, chicken) and oh man! It was an amazing FILLING salad for a great price! I also had an iced chai latte, my favorite \"coffee\" drink, and they nailed it! I'll certainly be coming here again"}
{"text":"Such a great and healthy alternative to fast food! This place is literally down the street from my house and I never had the chance to to try it out since there is always a line. I was not disappointed. The California club sandwich was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"2nd best Best breakfast place in the valley (only to butters) if you ask me...can't beat the price of this place though. The oatmeal is the grandest oatmeal you'll ever have, so simple yet so delicious. The \"oatmeal\" part is actually quinoa which provides a great amount of protein and will keep you full until lunch time, if not later. Extremely healthy oatmeal that can't be compared to other places. Overall, such a quaint environment...their name speaks for itself when it comes to the food. The \"house style\" frittata is also pretty d'lish; it's served atop hash browns and toast, and topped with a spicy sauce. Coffee drinks are above-par."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a healthy yet tasty breakfast and quick! The breakfast buzz smoothie is must, especially if you're in a rush or want a light breakfast. I always go for the breakfast club as well. The tomato bialy adds the perfect extra flavor."}
{"text":"I love this location and the patio is spacious (and dog friendly!) Try the Breakfast Buzz shake, AMAZING."}
{"text":"Until recently I was the duchess of d'lish and it's about time I updated my review to reflect how amazing of a place it truly is.. a diamond in the rough.   Once I first tried the food menu I was insanely hooked. I now have a goal of trying every single thing on it and I'm about half way complete. It's a great place to swing by for breakfast to not only jump start your day with some protein, but to jump start your day with fun. One time a robot took my order!!  Lunch is just as nice. The staff is great while you are there and really appreciate their customers (and they even tell you).  My favorite breakfast has to be the croissant sandwich (with no tomato) and for lunch I've ended up getting the chicken panini more than anything else.   If I'm craving a hot drink it's always a chai latte and for cold it's an arnold palmer with black tea.  If you haven't been here yet, you should go out of your way to swing by!"}
{"text":"I love this place but today I've been disappointed at the face that I ordered 2 broccoli sides and they both did NOT HAVE FETA CHEESE  IN THEM :( this was way disappointed I spent 16 bucks on all my food today and the one ingredient that I look forward to having was missing :("}
{"text":"So I've been anxiously waiting for more healthy options to come to my part of town. When I saw this place was about to come in I got super hyped! Finally open for business and here I am eating lunch. As usual my reviews are largely based on how good customer service is so I will start there.   Customer Service: 5*!! That's right 5 stars alone for the service. Everyone here is amazing. Even though the cashier was on the phone taking a to go order when I walked in, he still acknowledged me.Once he was off phone I was asked if I'd been here before and when I said no, he started to suggest what I would like. (After asking if I felt for breakfast or lunch) he suggested the Humanitarian, and after reading what was in it I said ok. He then offered me a sample of their  special nitro coldbrew. The other employees have been just as nice and easy going. Having fun as they work. I've sat here watching them all work in the kitchen and even the owner had gloves on and showing other employees how to properly make a burrito. Impressive.  Food: Smoothie with garlic in it?? Don't let it scare you, I was given a sample and there is no taste of garlic in it! It's super smooth, tasty, and refreshing all at the same time. The Humanitarian burrito is also very light, crunchy . I feel that next time I should add avocado to add a creamier texture. But definitely a good and appreciated suggestion. Will order again for sure. And the cold brew is just amazing, smooth, light and no bitterness to it at all. All in all this has been an incredible experience that I look forward to enjoying again. The fact that they have WiFi is also a great bonus. The cleanliness and open atmosphere will have me coming back more often than I probably should."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast buzz at D'lite! The drive through does take forever in the morning to only get a shake. They are also pretty expensive and from what I can see through the drive-through window is they are all premade in a giant blender. It makes me wonder if I'm actually getting a good amount of espresso in my drink.   I've also had their turkey sandwich it is really good! The bread is fresh and the meat was sliced perfect!"}
{"text":"I just absolutely love this place! First visit I had the California club and it was amazing!! I'm here again and diving into the Southwest bowl, it's so good!!!"}
{"text":"So I'll admit that when I find something that makes my taste buds beyond happy, that I get a little obsessed with it.  D'Lite Healthy has that thing for me.  Ladies and gentleman; I give you....the Breakfast Buzz.  The Breakfast Buzz is the penultimate of all breakfast shakes in my book.  Here's why: Protein Powder - Check! Chocolate, Bananas and Peanut Butter - Check, check, check!!  And Espresso you say?!?  CHECK!!  This is seriously all things that I absolutely love combined into a tasty, delicious, creamy shake.  I seriously get it at least once a week; like I said....I can get obsessed.  If you are like me and love a great breakfast shake, then you should hightail it to D'Lite stat!!  You don't even have to get out of your car if you don't want to; they'll serve you in their drive-through.  You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"I go there about three times a month and every time it's a great experience... I typically get the az burro which is delicious, and really tasty enchilada style... The staff is where it's at though...always always extremely friendly. Love this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by a few days ago and the helpful cashier suggested the cali club and breakfast buzz, which I went with.  Both were PHENOMENAL, will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"The strong points are the friendly, attentive service, and a nice lounge chair sitting area towards the front; loved the fact they had the bowl game on.  The store is clean and well lit and has Wi-Fi.  The menu itself is a bit limited, or as another reviewer said, 'modest.'    We ordered a Turkey Club Sandwich, a Chicken Breast Panini, with a side of the Portabello soup.   The food was good; portions were average size.   Re pricing, as an example, the Club was $8.50 with no sides or garnishes or drink, and it was a nice, but average sandwich; this is a $$ tab by the time you order a complete meal. That said, I'm sure I'll be back because I like the environment and it seems healthy."}
{"text":"Good, timely service. Sandwich was a bit small for the price but it was very good. Coffee is above average but wouldn't recommend ordering a large as it's 32 ounces and quite a challenge to finish."}
{"text":"Amazing food/ drinks but the service is SO SLOW. They have got to do something to speed things up at this place. No matter the time of day or what day it is you will be sitting in the drive thru for a good 15 mins."}
{"text":"California Club and Breakfast Buzz. Nuff said. I could grab either one of those for breakfast every day and still be happy. If you haven't been to D'lish you are missing out.. SO good!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place and absolutely love it. It is so nice to have a healthy food drive thru that you can grab at any time of the day. The people that work here are awesome, and the service is great. The breakfast buzz and the California club breakfast sandwich are to die for. I would eat these every day if I could!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good ... got the low carb breakfast bowl ... added chicken sausage ... yummy.   My only suggestion ... it would be great if the calories were posted like most places do these days. Other than that, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The reality is that I'm a big person that needs to be a smaller person. So in all fairness, I'm limited in what my choices are here and am criticizing the most difficult item on the menu. Despite the other incredible looking and highly recommend coffee drinks and croissant sandwiches.  The low carb breakfast was pretty tasty overall. The bacon was a little weird and tough and I was surprised to see a little brick of potato patty included as a low carb option. Like I said, it was tasty and I wasn't complaining because even if it wasn't exactly what I expected, since I've been dieting I'm always hungry and could eat a tire if I added salt.  Seriously though, the staff is very upbeat and knowledgeable, the place is clean and I definitely recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  I love places that are exactly what you expect with great food.  It's not huge, not an amazing dining experience on the inside, etc.  It's great food, nice people, good prices, and EXACTLY what you want when you go there.  Healthy fresh selections. I have a hard time driving past it and not stopping in!!"}
{"text":"Brilliant business model. Fast, delicious seriously healthy food. Great for Gluten-free, or vegetarians, or vegans, or anything that ends in -Ans.   Small place, order right up at front counter. A ton of crazy delicious items - bowls - smoothies -   Parking can be slightly tricky, especially with the lady in the drive through burrito place next door yelling at me for going the wrong way through her empty drive-thru. Oops."}
{"text":"Everybody working here needs to look alive.... smh. Worst customer service. Literally just hand out your drink with not a simple \"hello, here's your drink for you \" gets our order wrong 2/3 times we go ."}
{"text":"First timer over here and the \"EARLY BIRD BURGER\" is absolutely delicious!!!! I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service, wait times, and parking Sucks!  I love the healthy and sustainable concept and the food was above average.  I have been to D'Lish three times, and have had horrible experiences with service, and having to wait 10-15 minutes for \"fast food\".  I understand that quality food takes time to make, but they need some serious help! I am beginning to think that the owners are stubborn and don't want to pay for more help.  I was also overcharged for my food on every occaison, and was so frustrated with the cashier, and the pressure of the long line of people waiting to order that I just said \"screw it\".  Based on food alone, I would give this place 4 stars.  But the bad service brings my rating down to 2 stars.  I hope that this place gets their act together because I would enjoy their food more with better service.  I also think they should be open later than 4pm.  Seriously, who eats a meal at 4pm?"}
{"text":"The most incredible thing on the menu is the AZ burro. Egg whites and feta are the best combination. The iced coffee was \"d'lish\" and the food was promptly brought to our table. If I lived in Scottsdale,  I'd be eating here all the time!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast burritos!! I have tried a few different ones and they are all good. Worth the extra wait."}
{"text":"The food is great- I love the black bean portobello burger and I practically lived off of the California club in college!   I go about once a month now for a quick bite to-go and while the food and service is still 5 star, I am so bummed that the seasonal smoothie is STILL the apricot peach. It's tasty, don't get me wrong; however, don't call it a 'seasonal' smoothie if it is going to be the same smoothie for a year. It definitely makes me question how fresh your products are."}
{"text":"It's very obvious this is chain restaurant that probably used to be good when they had one or two stores but now is not. I think this used to be a McDonalds and it still feels like it inside but at like 10x the price. The last time I was there I added avocado to my order, paid for it, and they left it off. The previous time my burrito was undercooked and literally ice cold to the touch. It just feels like you're paying restaurant prices for (not great) fast food that's dressed up by their \"healthy\" tagline."}
{"text":"Cute place!  Nice drive-thru window.  Adorable, really.  Nice patio-dining/lounging.  Noise-level inside was a little loud, but there were eight people, six of w/c were talkative yelpers (ha!), plus Kyle and Chad, owners of D'lish (who were, btw, easy on the eyes... a great asset for any business!).  One special request- please offer Maya Chai!  While Oregon Chai tastes OK, I'm allergic (I suspect there are \"natural flavors\" involved), and organic Maya Chai is multiple-times better (and, most importantly, I don't recall feeling negative effects after)!  Great spot to unwind and rejuvenate.  Will come back soon to try the food!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too happy with this one. Followed the 4.5 star review on yelp and figured we would give it a shot. Coffee was okay, nothing spectacular. The food was not worth going back for. We had breakfast, the frittata and the breakfast croissant sandwich. The eggs were over cooked to the point they were rubbery tasting. The staff was nice but other then that, not a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"Quite satisfied with our delicious low carb breakfast bowls- or as we dubbed them \"breakfast salads\". Organic greens with tomato, avocado, 2 eggs, cheese and a pesto and balsamic drizzle. I was a bit confused because it also came with a hash brown patty which is definitely NOT low carb. When I asked the cashier about it he just shrugged. I just ordered it with no hash browns and he offered an extra egg. Yes please! It was quick, delicious, healthy and cheap. After driving all night from Santa Cruz it was just what we needed!!"}
{"text":"Have only been there once. I ate inside, versus on the patio. There is no bathroom for patrons.   When I asked if this was against the law, I was told, \"No , that's only if we serve alcohol.\"   Really?   So, after I ate my veggie burger and left, i just pee'd outside on the grate -- the one right in front of where the drive-up customers drive up.  I waved to a few who had braked for me after I stood up , shook off and zipped up."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place that gets crazy during the rush and there is very little parking but with that said YOU MUST GO HERE AND TRY THE CALIFORNIA CLUB FOR BREAKFAST.  It is pretty much the best breakfast sandwich on the planet.  I usually use the drive through and it doesn't always go that fast but it is well worth the wait.  This place is popular for a reason...check it out."}
{"text":"I believe they changed their menu or something. I have been going here since they first opened the Tempe location. Have gone a few times to the Shea location. Went on Sunday and was completely disappointed in everything I got besides the breakfast buzz. My humanitarian did not have the extra avocado I was charged. The vegetables looked and tasted like they came from a fast food place like Burger King equivalent, maybe even worse. I also got the hummus which they only gave me about a tablespoon  and it had absolutely no flavor. The veggies that came with it were disgusting and very low quality. The pita was ok but I wish I would have been able to eat it with some hummus, but unfortunately it was gone in about three bites with the gross veggies. The service has also been very off lately. I'm sad because I used to love this place, and have been a loyal customer, but after that expensive meal that I could hardly eat (I also tipped very generously btw) I don't think I will he going back."}
{"text":"Love love love the california club breakfast sandwich.  I crave it whenever I am near one of these locations.  I ordered it without meat this time and it was just as awesome.  Something about the soft bread, great egg, and pesto with cheese that makes this sandwich heaven.  This location is much larger with more parking than the Thomas and Scottsdale road location and it is nice and new inside.  I usually hit this place up on a Tuesday morning for a once per month meeting that starts early so I get here between 7-7:30am and no one is ever there that early during the week so I have the place to myself.  Highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet....its awesome."}
{"text":"bad day? wrong order? I was so excited to try this place and was rather disappointed. The veggie wrap my friend ordered was bland and very unexciting. And the bowl I ordered tasted like canned mushroom soup - is it a bowl or is it a soup? Neither of us finished our food... The service was trite... one minute I'm giving my order the next i'm being ignored... and then poof, i'm ordering and then sort of being helped... abrasively but with a smile... no thanks.... I totally enjoyed my chai latte... but probably not going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Went to Dlish for the first time on Sunday for lunch.  It was a great place to go.  Ordered a turkey cranberry sandwich and had it switched to a style without bread.  They tried to make it as close to what I wanted and they well exceeded my expectations.  Great place to go for breakfast or lunch!!"}
{"text":"Busy little place.  Stopped in at around 10:30 AM and found a table near the window.  Be prepared for a noisy atmosphere.  They play music while you dine, but it has to compete with kitchen noise and patron conversations.  I would recommend sitting outside.  Decided to order the egg and cheese sandwich, with their chicken sausage and a Glorious Orange smoothie.  Total price was almost $12.00.  The price for their smoothies is pretty standard: $5.00 for a large.  However, $6.00 for a sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich is a little steep.  Not to mention the fact that I paid $1.50 for a few slices of sausage.  I'm not sure how they justify that cost.  The sausage added a nice flavor to an otherwise bland egg and cheese sandwich.  I also recommend spicing it up with some of their hot sauce.    They chose to use \"bialy\" bread for their breakfast sandwiches, which is an excellent decision.  The bread is soft and spongy, with a texture similar to a bagel.  All in all, the food wasn't too bad.  For me, the price is the main concern.  I don't want to fork out almost $7.00 for a simple breakfast sandwich.  With so many breakfast joints to choose from, I can't say that I will be back anytime soon.  Nice guys, though.  You should definitely visit at least once and say 'hello.'"}
{"text":"3 Stars for the food, zero stars for the ambiance/noise/parking.  Maybe that's why they have the words 'drive'thru' in their name.  I got the Kitchen Sink salad, added Chicken.  It was fine, and a decent price.  But the noise level in the restaurant was so incredibly loud that my friend and I actually would just burst out laughing because we coudn't hear a word that either was saying.  Throw in a blender and then random music being turned up even louder just for good measure and it just became comical.  I would go back for the food and bring it back to my desk, but would never actually eat there again."}
{"text":"Great, reasonably healthy food, and priced like fast-food. The service can be curt at times, but I tend to give them a pass because they do run a very busy drive through."}
{"text":"Long lines but always worth it.  The breakfast buzz is my all time favorite pick me up."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is great. Breakfast buzz and protein burgers are a weekly staple in my diet. Staff is friendly. It can get crowded and limited parking. Must try and you will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"D'Breakfast Buzz is sooooo good you can't go wrong with that shake and it's filling."}
{"text":"Seriously in love with this location. Everyone here is super friendly. The food is fresh and delicious. The drive thru is convenient.  Their green tea is so refreshing. The Turkey Club is one of my all time favorites but their bowls are also worth tasting. I haven't tried their burgers but I will one day. The breakfast menu options are also worth trying. I opt for the frittatas or az burro. The oatmeal isn't all that bad but the other items are sooooo much better."}
{"text":"This place is fucking amazing--coming from a fatass who hates \"healthy\" food. Fucking delicious."}
{"text":"Omgosh. Thank goodness we didn't try this place while we were still living in Arizona or else we'd be broke from coming here all the time! We tried their drive thru, dined in, and had gotten take out. Everything is so good, fresh, and made so quickly! It's nice that they made drive-thru an option - a much healthier alternative to your typical fast food joints.  Food: 1) Turkey club 2) Veggie d'lite 3) Dirty chai (chai with a shot of espresso) - tried it hot & cold. Both were good but the iced was a little better 4) Protein shake 5) AZ Burro 7) Veggie Burrito 7) Breakfast buzz  All the drinks and food were so delicious and cheap considering how healthy it is! All the workers are polite and they work fast. My mouth is watering as I write the review! Oh how I miss D'lish...!"}
{"text":"California Club is AMAZING plus an iced mocha. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty! Tasty! Tasty!  Did I mention that the food here is tasty?!  LOL  I love the fact that they are open at 6am, so hit up the drive-thru and grab breakfast before work.  I've had the Cali Club and the Veggie Burrito.  The cali club is by far my favorite!  The veggie burrito was good, but a little on the bland side (even with the salsa).  Added salt and pepper after the first few bites, and it was then prefect.    This place can get super packed for during the brunch/lunch hour, and the parking lot is really small. so ordering ahead is always advised.    Think I'll go get a Cali Club tomorrow for breakfast!  :D"}
{"text":"The GREEN LEMONADE is AMAZING!!! It's the best combination of sweetness and greens.  The addition of ginger and cilantro makes it the best juice ever. I couldn't put it down!!"}
{"text":"This is my default to-go for lunch. I have tried the AZ burrito , veggie burrito, frittata and a few other dishes. Never been disappointed with the taste and quantity. Definitely one of the healthier options out there. The service is excellent. I have dined in but generally use their drive thru to get my lunch. When there is a queue 1-2 staff come out and take your orders. Highly recommended for a quick, healthy and delicious breakfast/ lunch.   They have protein shakes also - excellent!!"}
{"text":"One of the best place in the world to eat your breakfast, the employees are great and always nice !  The best things to eat there is the California one don't miss that ! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! The food is delicious, healthy and fast. Every person I have interacted with at this location is friendly and efficient. I am addicted!"}
{"text":"3 stars because their food is awesome but can never seem to get my order right whether they're busy or not. The one on Scottsdale Rd is SO much better. Every morning the one on Scottsdale Rd has a line out to the street and they still get my order right every time. They even repeat my order back to me when they hand me the food. The employees at this D'lish just really don't seem to care, which is super disappointing. I'll be making the trip to the Scottsdale location from now on."}
{"text":"You know, it's really a nice thing to have an option for a fast, but relatively healthy breakfast.  The restaurant itself is basically a drive thru type place with a slight coffee house vibe on the inside.  They weren't slammed but were pretty steady, and were able to move customers through quickly.  I had the veggie burrito, which was pretty good and cheesy, and was served with a very tasty, very mild salsa which gave it some flavor it otherwise would have been lacking.  Tanya had the veggie frittata, which was also quite good and was served on toast, which was a little more than lightly buttered, but that's okay.  Broccoli for breakfast ain't really my bag, but she seemed to be okay with it.  The place seems priced about right, and it's nice to finish breakfast out and not feel like a big fat whale.  For that alone, this place would get my recommendation, but they manage to make healthyish food taste pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Dlish always does it right. From the wraps to the salads you can not go wrong with anything on this menu!! Plus the drive through is clutch when you want a quick dinner but are not feeling Mcdonalds. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago and I really loved it. I thought it was great that most of the ingredients were vegan and vegetarian friendly. My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had a strawberry banana smoothie and my husband had a chocolate, coffee peanut butter protein shake to die for. And we had bagels that were very tasty. I would love to come back here for lunch, everything sounded excellent, especially the soup. I was also impressed with the staff....I thought that was the best feature of this whole place. They are super friendly, and this one guy, was SOOOOOOOO Funny the way he was greeting people and making jokes. It was very outgoing and it made the customers feel like they had been coming there forever even if it was their first time. It also makes patrons and business owners feel like they are an important part of the community with the camaraderie that takes place here. I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to when I'm in a hurry for breakfast in Phoenix. They have delicious Nitro Toddy and I LOVE their breakfast burritos- the veggie and the AZ Burro. My husband tried the low carb breakfast and he was impressed too (see photo). Quick and efficient service, healthy and delicious food/coffee and a great price point."}
{"text":"Management took care of me and this time it was to perfection. Love this place and their food. Highly recommend the cali club and breakfast buzz!"}
{"text":"First time, went signature on both food/drink (California club/Breakfast buzz). Service was exceptional, food is fresh & hot, very good place. Small place primarily drive thru or togo, about 6 tables & counter seating. Loud due to the blenders & good mellow tunes playing."}
{"text":"How many times have you wanted healthy food but had no time to sit down or run into a Sprouts or TJ's?! D'lite is the answer! Healthy drive-thru! You can park and sit down and enjoy the food there, but if you're in a time crunch, they offer drive by service. So convenient, and the food is delicious. The Breakfast Buzz is their most popular drink, and for good reason. It's my new go to morning drink. Chocolate, banana, espresso?! What else is there? I also love their chicken pesto sandwich, and their side beet salad with goat cheese. There are tons of vegetarian options, and vegan as well. The Breakfast Buzz comes in a vegan form as well! The service is always great, and everyone is kind and helpful. :) love it all."}
{"text":"This place is very unique and healthy! Their wraps are amazing and the blended \"buzz\" is very addicting. The only downside is the parking situation. I hate having to pull into this place because I feel like im either holding up traffic or about to get hit. A better idea - park at the Albertsons parking lot and WALK over. It'll be worth the few extra steps :)"}
{"text":"In a weird location in Tempe and run by what seems to be college kids so service is very lax but staff is always very friendly. I've only ordered the California Club because I enjoy it so much but I have heard you can't really go wrong with anything. I work near by and my coworkers go at least twice a week for breakfast and lunch so they always rave about it. Next time I go I'm trying something new.  Funny Note: The back parking lot really reminds me of a Sonic but I have never been there when the speaker service is working."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5 Happiness - 3/5  Despite the utter temptation of fried chicken from nearby restaurants, I went to this small healthy eatery. The menu is huge, with rice/quinoa bowls, wraps, salads, soup, breakfast items and plenty of drinks (coffee and juices... not alcohol!).   I got an egg and chicken sausage sandwich (on a bialy) and then a couple of bagels for the kids. I also got the mushroom soup, which was really thick and flavorful. And it was portabella based, which is great if you are a mushroom fan. The sandwich was OK but honestly lacked taste (it sorely needed some heat). The bialy was bland as well, which I view as a capital sin. The sausage was a bit on the chewier side. The kids devoured their bagels (and stole a bit of my soup too).  This is a unique option that prioritizes drive thru. So when you have the willpower to go healthy while driving, this will meet your goal (even if it won't blow you away)."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Fast service and excellent food. Love the fact they have a drive-thru and great selection. Go to items - Kitchen Sink salad and the Humanitarian Chix Supreme wrap ;)"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I like to stop here when we're in town, especially when we're in a hurry for a good (and healthy) bite to eat. Well, I suppose it's not exactly a \"quick\" fix if you go during peak lunch hours, but what place is during those times anyway.  Service is great. They're always super friendly and welcoming, whether in the drive-through or if you go inside.  Food is amazing, as most of the other reviews have stated. I'm a tuna sandwich sucker, and this place makes me feel so much better about eating one. It's a \"healtified\" version, and it's actually even better than the original that's drenched in mayo. Burgers are yum, and I always love the teas they have. Prickly Pear seems to be a favorite of mine.  Parking lot sucks though. It's highly inconvenient, so be patient and careful while driving through or parking."}
{"text":"All bfast burritos are great.  Wish the salsa was more flavorful/spicy.  Love that they have sundried tomato wraps.  Hummus plate for $5 is an absolute steal.  So big & good (homemade hummus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, etc.).  SUPER friendly & fast service, both inside and drive thru.  Love the decor/colors, vibe.  Espresso could be better, it was a little bitter.  I want to try everything on the menu.  It all sounds so great."}
{"text":"Favorite place for a fast, healthy & delicious breakfast! All the employees are super friendly, too. I get the breakfast buzz at least 4x a week!!"}
{"text":"Great find on a hockey trip to Scottsdale. Yummy breakfast options and quick, friendly service. Tried the California club based on reviews--good choice (substantial but not too heavy).  veggie burrito was good and filling, as was the low carb breakfast which \"hit the spot\". Latte and iced coffee were good."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab a quick, healthy breakfast before heading to work. Their breakfast buzz shake was DELICIOUS. Had the right consistency to a shake, tasted fresh, and wasn't too sweet. My only gripe was we did a phone order hoping it'll be ready when we got there but they ended up making it after we paid at the register, pretty much defeats the purpose of calling in.  I also tried their breakfast burrito, definitely on the healthier side than what I'm used. It needed more cheese and seasoning. And the ratio to egg, cheese, and potato was off. Had a ton more scrambled eggs then I wanted.  The place is super clean, really hip with modern furniture/seating. Definitely want to go back to try their lunch!"}
{"text":"April 28, 2016 around 8 am. Love the food here everything is usually yummy. But today I came here and thought about ordering a smoothie, the Four Berry smoothie. I'm very health concious and wanted to know the ingredients that went into my smoothie because many smoothies are filled with sugar and artificial additives. When I first asked what was in the smoothie the girl replied in a very sarcastic voice and said \"four berries.\" Then when I asked again she listed off the four berries finally. Then I asked what else was in it (because obviously a smoothie isn't made out of just four blended berries) So then finally she said a banana. THEN I ask what liquid is in the smoothie that makes it a smoothie and she says \"the berries make it a smoothie\" The entire time she was talking in an extremely rude voice and being completely unhelpful and vague. So dossapoiinted I just wanted a smoothie but I gave up. When we got to the window for the coffee we ordered someone that seemed to be the manager was up there and was rude and unfriendly to us as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of being in Portland for some odd reason. The restaurant is pretty small, but the good thing is they have a drive-thru.  Breakfast selections were straight to the point. I had their Low-Carb breakfast that I ordered with a side of chicken sausage. I have no idea why this place calls this breakfast \"low-carb\" because it comes with a hash brown. I think a piece of wheat toast would have lower carbs than a baked hash brown. I would probably rename this  \"Low-Carb\" breakfast to \"breakfast salad\" because all it was just a salad with a hash brown and egg on top. It was served on a bed of greens with tomatoes on the side. The dish had balsamic vinaigrette on the bottom of the greens, and pesto sauce drizzled on the top.  I didn't like how my eggs were over hard.  In fairness, this dish had a nice presentation.   If I were to remake this dish, I would probably have the eggs poached, skip the hash brown, and add turkey bacon crumbles. The chicken sausage was nothing special. It was one sausage sliced up covered in cheese that became hard. They should probably grate the cheese over the sausage so it melts delicately on the sausage.   My brother-in-law had the breakfast \"traditional burrito\".  He was not to happy with it and thought it could use more cheese and flavor.  This is definitely a quasi healthy spot."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The concept is great, its cheap(ish) and healthy.  But I've gotten a hair in my food two times.  I really liked the food here, so when I got a hair in my bagel one time I totally almost vomited, couldn't finish eating, but still I went back because the food was good.  The second time when I got it in my sandwich, I pretty much decided NEVER AGAIN.  Either they did not like me or their kitchen is really unclean or they all need to wear hairnets and beard nets since it is hipster mecca."}
{"text":"There is a place in Arizona where the convenience of fast food meets the benefits of a fresh, quasi vegetarian menu in a salubrious confluence of amazing food and drinks. This place is D'Lish. Didn't see that coming, did you?  While this place is great any day of the week, I usually like to include it in my weekend routine. What is that routine you ask, well I'll tell you. I wake up before sunrise and hike a mountain shaped like a camel. At the top, I fight a dragon who has swallowed a magical key that will unlock a room at the top of a tower that contains a riddling troll who will eat you if you cannot answer his three mind puzzles. After wrenching the key from the bowels of the flying beast, I realize I'm hungry, so I stop at D'Lish for an early morning meal, which delivers every time to satiate my heroic appetite.  The AZ Burro, the Protein Burgers (House style and early bird) are my personal favorites, but I have yet to eat something there I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I even like the frittatas, which I previously thought to be punishment disguised as food.  And then there're the drinks, which seem to have already been covered thoroughly by my fellow yelpers, so I'll just say this: I can see The \"Dwayne Johnson\" Rock drinking/eating a breakfast buzz. Or at least that's how I like to picture myself when I consume one.  Having devoured my breakfast burrito and protein peanut butter coffee drink, I continue my weekend quest to the tower with the troll, fueled by the life-giving offerings of D'Lish Kitchen and Coffee House."}
{"text":"Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the \"man\" salad.   The salad was really good!!!!  On a hot summer day, the salad is a perfect choice for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"D'Lite is damn near perfect. There's not much I can add to the huge amount of glowing reviews, but the friendly staff, extremely clean dining space, and amazingly-tasty (and quick) food all definitely earns their 5 star average.  Their iced coffee is perfect and I've tried two separate breakfast dishes:   1) The AZ burro (sans feta) was the perfect breakfast burrito (turkey, potatoes, avocado, egg whites, tomato). It fills you up without killing you and rendering your morning workout useless.   2) The low carb breakfast (2 eggs, tomato, avocado, greens, hash brown patty (!) and pesto drizzle (!!)) was different and light and so, so tasty.   My husband has stuck with two of his new favorites: their riff on quinoa oatmeal--I love that they offer a variety of milk choices, and their California club.  That's all you need to know. Go and love!"}
{"text":"My favorite healthy fast food place around.  It's not just the typical salad and wrap place.  It's kind of funny because I feel like a lot of places around try to copy D'Lite but they just aren't the same."}
{"text":"Fresh fast food, unique menu, and great employees.  What's not to love.  I go hear all the time so that's pretty much the best compliment I can give."}
{"text":"D'Lish was great!  I order the Cali breakfast sandwhich and it was awesome.  Reasonably priced, plenty of seating, and the food was made quickly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches. Healthy to-go options. We came here every day on our visit."}
{"text":"Good place, but a little pricey.   I was looking for some brunch, and didn't want to get something unhealthy. Yelped around and found this place. Took a look at the menu and decided that yes, it seems to be worth my time and money.   That said, I ordered a veggie burrito and a four berry smoothie.  I added avocado to the burrito and it probably made it even more delicious. The burrito overall tasted really... fresh! Didn't taste processed at all. It was as if they had fresh ingredients laying around and threw it into a torrilla, which was a sun dried tomato one.  The four berry smoothie was really fresh tasting, not that artificial tasting powder stuff that other places have. I think it consisted of raspberry, blackberry, strawberry and blueberry... and banana.   Overall, this place is really good. I think it's not really worth the money, but still good. Portions sizes for both things I bought didn't really reflect the prices in my opinion. But if you are looking to get into the healthy fresh fast food world, I think this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"Had the turkey club... ehh I mean it was good don't get me wrong but it wasn't wow. the drive thru was crazy almost out on the street. I parked and got it to go and still got out faster than the drive thru lane."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was in town visiting from Las Vegas and found it based on all the Yelp Reviews. I got here just in time before the drive thru line went out into the street. I ordered the turkey sandwich with no bacon and it was delicious. Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. The ice coffee was good too. I highly recommend this place! A+++"}
{"text":"What to do before heading out to the ballgame?  D'lish is the answer.    Great place, great local crowd.  Ended up going every single morning of our Spring Training trip.    The first day, we parked and went inside - ordered breakfast sammy's: a California club and a breakfast burrito - with a cup of coffee.  Very good both - but as we watched what the Regulars were ordering and we continued to read and re-read the menu as we enjoyed our breakfast we realized we missed the BOAT (Best Of All Time) - that's right all you Regulars know what I'm talking about - The Breakfast Buzz shake!!! Vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate all blended with some ice! Oh yeah, great start and keeps you going all morning!   Oh and you don't even need to get out of the car. - 'cause you don't need to sit down at a table to enjoy it.  Utilize the drive-thru - and you are all fueled up - drink and enjoy as you drive to the ballpark."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and always taste fresh... When you can make it here.... Id be here 2 or 3 times a week if their hours didnt suck. You come most times of the day and its busy . but still they close early . just doesn't make sense. Stay open til 6 or 7 and get the crowd who is just getting off work."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying there is no parking... the drive thru line takes up both sides of the parking lot. Besides the parking issue this place is awesome. The workers are friendly and so polite and seem to have great personalities. They're quick and efficient! The food was great and had cream cheese in it? I didn't even taste it though. Anyways this place is cool and I'd recommend. Just park somewhere else and walk"}
{"text":"Nothing beats D'lish after a nice Camelback hike.  Some of the best iced coffee in town and the food choices are healthy, appropriately portioned, and diverse. I've enjoyed mostly their vegetarian options, but their carnivorous offerings are really, really tasty as well--I recommend the Low Carb Breakfast, which is mixed greens and fresh tomatoes topped with a hash brown, fried eggs, and some pesto.  I don't recommend the \"drive thru\", you'll be waiting for looooong time (although I've heard you can call ahead and reduce this wait). The seating inside is a bit cramped (the new Tempe location has a cozier patio) but I kind of like that charm in a place like this."}
{"text":"We've anxiously awaited for this location to open. It's closer to home, than the Scottsdale location.   The food has the same great flavor as the other location, however the serving size was significantly smaller. Basically half the size of the servings in Scottsdale, but the same prices which aren't the cheapest. It would be better to have a consistent experience across the locations.   I hate that we were disappointed, we've been regulars for years. Back to Old Town we go."}
{"text":"The beet salad is to die for...and I hate beets! The food is always good and the people are cool.  Nice healthy choices. I have heard their breakfasts are good too, but haven't had the chance yet. YUM!"}
{"text":"Awesome, tasty breakfast/brunch options. Everything was hot and fresh. Everyone was super friendly. The orange glorious smoothie was to die for. The kitchen had a mixup with our order and they completely went above and beyond to make up for it. The people that work here are truly good people. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times now for lunch and really enjoy it.  It has a small menu with just a few sandwich and salad options; you can also get breakfast all day (I believe).  They are known (apparently) for coffee, which I have not yet had the pleasure of enjoying.  I had the veggie wrap the first time and tuna salad sandwich today - LOVED the dill spice in the tuna.  Very fresh and well...D'lish."}
{"text":"My friends were boasting about this place and so I threw it on my bookmark list. Today I had the pleasure to stop in for some breakfast and I was very delighted!   I got the California Club sammich which was divine  I also had a caramel latte and it too was cute  What totally made my visit was when the ASU mens rugby team walked in...  I melted!"}
{"text":"I wanted something quick and tasty and the yelp reviews were great so I decided to give it a shot.  I was pleased with my salad, I got the Kitchen Sink! I do recommend it!  The only reason I gave it a 3 star review, is because I feel like the portion size wasn't very satisfying (or maybe I was really hungry that day) and the parking situation there is horrible.  They have a drive thru, but I opted to go in and eat lunch inside.  When I came out, the drive thru line was long and I couldn't back out my car because of the way the parking lot and drive thru is set up.  Not ideal, especially when you're trying to get back to work from your lunch break.  So in short food is tasty, but for me personally, the parking sitch alone makes me want to not go back."}
{"text":"What a little gem. I had this place bookmarked and it was highly recommended I try the California Club - I listened and am so glad I did! It was the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a long time! My iced latte complimented it perfectly. I only regret I was too stuffed to go crazy with the Breakfast Buzz...saw so many people coming in to order it.  My only reason for not giving this place the 4 stars it earned with its great food is due to the service. Nice people, just not the most alert. I was sitting at the counter for a good 10 mins and gave him time to attend to me when 3 different people walked in and got taken care of first. Not cool. But I'm sure they're workin' on it and anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. I'm always trying to find new things to love and this place satisfied me even with my particular tastes. My husband loved his panini and I loved my turkey sandwhich. It's very small, but very nice to sit on the patio and enjoy good, healthly food with a lemonade! Would love to come here again."}
{"text":"Just walked out of there. Ordered coffee and was treated very rudely.  The workers were more interested in talking to each other then helping their one and only customer.    I had ordered my coffee. Asked for whipped cream. A guy who was behind the cashier said,  this isn't Starbucks.  I personally hate Starbucks. I didn't say anything.  But then the girl cashier says,  sheesh he is only joking.  I walked out of there immediately.  Off to Dutch brothers. Always get great coffee and great attitudes"}
{"text":"Groovy little joint located in Scottsdale. Not bad for a quick, healthy bite if in the area. Keep your eyes peeled, easy to miss while on the road. But when you find it, go ahead and enter the quaint,  small coffee shop and take a peak around- witness the gleam of natural light shine through the windows,  and walk up to the counter to glance at the menu and decide on your order. I got the California club & egg sandwich, which both were delicious. Hot and fresh, quick and easy- boom! Only downside is no public restroom - go 2 buildings down to the bar and use theirs."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I'm a first timer here and I'm converted for LIFE!!  I got the \"oatmeal our way\" (organic quinoa, vanilla macaroon granola, seasonal fruit and choice of steamed milk). It was an enormous bowl of delicious and only $4.50!!!!!  The owner was the cashier and was so nice and friendly!!!!  LONG LIVE D'LISH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Two words: Breakfast. Buzz. That's all you need to know. Super friendly staff. Line may look long at times but it goes quickly."}
{"text":"After a long and hot hike at camelback, you MUST stop by and get a smoothie with protein for an awesome recovery. Great service, super friendly staff and delicious food, don't forget to try the humanitarian wrap and add chicken supreme, that's another amazing concoction ... chicken feta and pesto sauce added to it ....Thanks Nathan and Leonard... you guys got a great team at D'Lite !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome - one of my favorite spots to stop for lunch if I'm in the area. It's a really cute, casual lunch spot. The California Club is my favorite (I'm an avocado nut), they also have a fantastic breakfast burrito. Everything I've had here is healthy, clean, and well prepared. It's nice that they have almond milk for lattes and they can definitely cater to people with food allergies or restrictions.   The only downside is parking can be a total nightmare - there is a very small parking lot and if you go during peak lunch hours - really anytime between 11:30 and 1:30 - it can be impossible to get a spot, or even pull into the lot. They also have a drive through, but it can take quite a while.   As long as you're not in a rush, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I can't stop craving the breakfast buzz- A yummy smoothie like espresso drink with banana and chocolate."}
{"text":"Been waiting to go here as we have gone to their sister stores in lower Scottsdale and Temp.  This is the first Franchised store and another will be opening at Camelback & Miller in the Sprout's Center there. The store was very clean and of course new.  We are picky and my wife has major food restrictions.  The Staff was very accommodating.  Afterward we debriefed with Autumn who helped open the store.  She is a wonderful Ambassador for the Brand to be sure.  My wife loves beets and they roast their beets every day.  Seriously!   Big score and hopefully they can sustain all the positive karma and buzz they have created.  Just look at the other reviews here.  Again, Autumn really knows her stuff. And my wife wants to go back several times during this upcoming week."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim. The Man Salad was sooo good. Reasonable prices and super fresh. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients. Tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Oh D'Lite (previously D'Lish)! We've been coming here since college and really enjoy this place. They have a wide variety of healthy options, an awesome \"breakfast buzz\" smoothie, and many other delicious options.   On this trip we stopped by the Scottsdale location where (we knew from prior visits) the parking can be a bit rough. The parking lot is very small and with the drive through it can be a pain to get into the lot and find a spot. Once you do you can walk inside where you will find a moderate amount of seating and a small outdoor patio.   After checking out d'Menu we got the California Club and Traditional Burrito for our breakfast. We also got two vegan breakfast buzz shakes. We already knew from prior visits we were going to enjoy the food as we've had it before and this visit was just as good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few vegan breakfast buzzes while in the area. They were bomb per normal!   I've never been to this location before but it is really nice! It definitely has the Scottsdale vibe to it. Unlike the south Scottsdale location, this one features plenty of parking and the inside is quite large. There is plenty of room here to spread out, meet up with friends, or do some group work.   All the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place, but when I pulled up I wasn't so sure about it.  It's really small and at 2 o'clock in the afternoon it was empty.  Pulled in and ordered the chicken panini and it's amazing!  The bread is so good and pesto is wonderful!  Will definitely come back to try more!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here four times. That proved to be four times too many. I tried, oh I tried, to find something appealing about this place. Beyond the very friendly staff, nothing else is making me want to come back. On my first venture, I ordered a breakfast burrito. Folks, you have to cook the egg. A runny egg, so runny I think the whites were still runny, in a breakfast burrito, is a breeding ground for disease. I mean, cook the friggin' egg. The next time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich. It was served on a bialy. They forgot to include flavor - any flavor. I started to chew on the wax paper to add some spice. I kept blaming myself, I mean I read these reviews and I wonder what is wrong with me. I only wonder that for a brief moment. Janice B says she is in NY and can't stop thinking about D'Lish. WHAT??? Are you iactually living in the city or are you trapped on the top floor of Bellevue? There is nothing, absolutely nothing in Phoenix or anywhere else that compares to anything in NYC. One moment in NYC makes you forget the rest of the world exists. I digress, anyway, my third visit was the veggie burrito. Nothing I like better than raw mushrooms stuffed in a burrito. Why did I go back for a fourth visit? I did, I ordered a mushroom soup. I thought they would have to cook the mushrooms in the soup? Who knows, it tasted like water. Dear D'Lish, the way you make mushroom soup is very simple. Start with some shallots, saute them in a stock pot, you can add onions and garlic if you wish. Next add a whole mess of mushrooms, you can just use white ones, or mix them up, cremini, portabella, oyster, just saute them until all the water is removed, then add stock and cook for about 20 minutes - blend soup to a creamy texture, finish with some milk or cream and you have soup. Salt and pepper to taste. So simple, and yet you just couldn't do it. I can't come back, sorry, four times is way too many attempts, but good luck, it appears many people do enjoy your flavorless, poorly cooked options."}
{"text":"I might have stretched a point and given D'Lite four stars except that everyone else seems to want to rate it 5* and D'Lite is definitely not that good.    This location is new and it is clean, bright, modern, and totally without soul.  You could move a McDonald's in here and it would feel right, except for no playground.  But who cares -- right?  The menu is modest but adequate, but the imagination is limited to the item names.  But who cares -- right?  The food is better than fast food but not as good as some sandwich shops I've patronized.  There are strong points, such as the chicken sausage, but ... To me the biggest flaw is the bread used in sandwiches and accompanying the frittatas. It's just plain dull bread.  The whole wheat, for example, is the kind that looks like white bread except a little browner, and is baked from finely ground wheat kernels.  This is barely healthier than the much-maligned white (check the glycemic index).  The panini isn't really a panini, just a baked sandwich, and some miscreant puts sweet relish in the tuna salad.  Who cares? -- I guess I do.  Note: the menu does not include calorie content - perhaps it is available elsewhere.  I think that would be interesting and possibly surprising."}
{"text":"This is a perfect little place to stop in, get a coffee, bite to eat and chill. Freshly made, healthy food, cool ambiance. Or if you don't have time to sit down, they also have a drive through. But it seems to be the busiest area, always a line of cars. But that's not a bad thing! Lines at restaurants always means good food! So far my favorite is the veggie frittata,  bursting with flavor!"}
{"text":"My 2 stars is for the concept. Having a healthy option is awesome. I give 0 stars for customer service. Everyone there seems stressed and they come off rude. I came here for kombucha tea  thinking that they made it there at the restaurant, but they literally pulled a bottle from the fridge and poured it into a cup. When I asked why they don't just give you the entire bottle instead of just a portion of it the guy said they only give you as much as you need. If I'm going to spend $4 on a drink I might as well go to Sprouts and get the entire drink. Such a joke"}
{"text":"I came here for late breakfast and got the AZ burro with chicken. It was delicious and good quality but kind of small. My dining companion got a veggie frittata which was delicious. The pricing wasn't too bad. Although, we didn't get much for the $25 we spent here compared to other sit down breakfast spots up the road in Old Town.   It's not a restaurant in which someone waits on you. There isn't much seating. It's a small shack of sorts.   Their drive thru had a line the entire time I was there which is a good sign. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Healthy, delicious, relaxed, fresh, clean place to grab coffee and a bite. The people that work there are amazing-friendly and helpful.  Free ice tea refills.  Vegetarian options available."}
{"text":"Bless me Yelp for I have dined. It's been many months since my last review. It's actually been awhile since I've had much opportunity to check out new (to me) places. It has been a rough year.   Things are turning around though, and I'm D'lighted to get my review'n skills back in shape.   I'm surprised I hadn't eaten here before. I guess I didn't even really know it existed to be honest. I live within a few blocks of here and I love breakfast and I drive by here frequently. Perhaps it is because I'm not a member of the vegetarian/vegan community... though I've dated several vegetarians and vegans so I'm pretty up to date on the places to go for that.   I haven't had my food at this place yet - I've only eaten from the drive through. It seems like a cute little place though. One of these days.   The food is tasty. It's about as tasty as it can be for something that can be considered a healthy breakfast. I tend to prefer a good thick greasy unhealthy artery clogging pile of bacon and some sort of fruit covered waffle or french toast drowned in maple syrup - that doesn't seem to be what this place is about. Still... it's true to its name. It is definitely delicious.   Their prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. It's quality food. I mean, I was getting burned out on shitty fast food breakfast places. I can't stomach the Breakfast Club douchetastic crowd most of the time, and I haven't been really up for eating around any sort of crowd on my weekend mornings. I'd rather eat in the comfort of my own home these days.   I'll have to update this when I have more to say about it - so far, I've only really sampled the food. I have yet to really experience the atmosphere and the service. Sooner or later though...  I'd say this is yet another reason why I still stand behind my belief that Scottsdale is an awesome place to live."}
{"text":"This is SUCH an amazing idea!! Why there aren't more healthy drive-thrus is beyond me!! The worst is when you are in a rush but want to eat healthy but there aren't any options available. I only wish there were more menu options available."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place.   They are able to make most of their menu GF and some dairy free as well.   Had their one of their burgers 'naked' which just means on a bed of greens with a fresh squeezed lemonade.    All in all good meal for price and with it being .3 miles from the hotel I am at this week works great."}
{"text":"Loved what I ordered here!   The low-carb breakfast is a great idea, and I think it will inspire me to create a similar meal at home.  A hash brown, two over-easy egg, atop a bed of greens all drizzled in pesto.  A pairing I wouldn't have thought to make on my own, but works wonderfully together!  Their pesto is not too thick, and tasted really fresh (maybe house-made?)  It was the perfect lunch for me, and I probably could've been satisfied with just one egg.  The california club sandwich was also noteworthy and full of flavor.  I could eat this for lunch, and maybe even dinner!  Man salad was huge - served in a gigantic bowl and included toasted bread.  There were a few parking spots, and a drive-thru.  Coming at an odd hour had plenty of seating, but not sure if this is true to the rush hours.  If you don't know where you're going - be sure to look out for it as you're driving by... It's easy to miss."}
{"text":"Staff here is SUPER CHILL...The strawberry lemonade here was flame, highly suggest. Traditional burrito was pretty tasty, wasn't the greatest burrito I've ever had but the combination with the lemonade made it easy for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a place that caters to a healthy lifestyle. This place was beyond delicious and totally hit the stop. They have a variety of different choices, but we had the Cali club and a latte. Both were amazing. Definitely wish we had this spot in Cali."}
{"text":"My daughter was getting moving out of the dorms and she wanted a last breakfast with her roommate and parents. Never knew about this place. Loved it here.   Small parking lot with a drive-thru. Seemed like the drive-thru always had a line while I was there. So I thought this must be a good place. Just found a little gem.   The parking lot, outside the door, and inside they have these big menus. So I park and look at the menu. Yum yum. Looks very interesting. Typical small joint. Order at the front, get a number, they bring the food to your table, and they clean up your table.   Anyways, I ordered the AZ Burro for breakfast. Smoked turkey, avocado, egg, feta, and hash. Doesn't sound very good but it was really good. Very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyed it.   Nice little place to enjoy breakfast and just enjoy the morning. Very surprised about this place but then again. Good food. Relaxing atmosphere. All I can say is enjoy."}
{"text":"Wanted to give another place a try for a quick bk so jumped on Yelp. I have to say I am lukewarm about it. I had the egg and cheese bk sandwich but without the cheese +bacon on a bagel as they were out of the bread it normally  comes on and it was ok. Prob need to add some salsa or sauce to it. It was fresh tasting tho. Also decided on a decaf coffee which was on the menu board but then I was told they actually don't have a decaf that they make but could do a pour over ... i.e. an Americano. I was like ok well do I get the same price and was told no that I would be charged for an Americano. I say okkkkkk.. Prob should take the decaf house off the menu board then .. Just sayin. .. So I opted to pay the additional price for the Americano and didn't like it at all, so I dumped it.  My kiddo ordered the bk burrito and the Italian soda with vanilla which she enjoyed. I noticed that the Italian soda had one price on the board but I was charged .50 more so I brought that to the cashiers attention and she said it was tax. I said no taxes are on the bottom of the receipt and it is not .50 tax on a $2.50 item . She spoke to the mgr and he told her to refund me the .50, so that was taken care of quickly and professionally. All in all ok place for me but not one I would frequent tho."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy to go order. I enjoyed the burrito as it was light and tasty. I did not enjoy the drive-thru aspect and the spot is so small, wasn't sure where the parking lot was. Probably just a drive-thru spot, I'm not sure. The girl working there was nice but I just couldn't justify the price of their items. I'm not a cheap guest but I just didn't find the value in the meals. It was a good meal but nothing memorable and I would not return nor refer."}
{"text":"Finding legitimate healthy options for breakfast or a quick lunch on the go can be a  hassle in Tempe, but D'lish has D'livered every time !  Excellent breakfast smoothies and several tasty options to eat for lunch!"}
{"text":"My morning go-to.  Love their vegan buzz kill, and the breakfast sandwiches.  Also, tge lemonade, juices, and green tea are bomb."}
{"text":"Sooooo I came here for a croissant 'wich and a dirty chai latte, my sandwich was delicious, but after taking a couple sips of my latte, something hard slipped into my mouth. I thought it was some curdled milk so I dug it out, only to find that it was definitely not curdled milk it was a roach. My chai was definitely dirty. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with a nice young couple that aren't shy about recommendations running the show. Decent coffee and the drive-thru is a plus."}
{"text":"I've been here several times the food is always fast and flavorful. Good service. Nice portions. The only reason I'm giving them a 4 stars is because their siracha cap is always so dirty even in the morning so it clearly isn't being cleaned. Gross."}
{"text":"The bowls here are D'lish. Really healthy and quick! The employees are sweet college kids."}
{"text":"I guess I wasn't as blown away by D'Lish as everyone else.  Maybe I was expecting greatness from reading so many five star reviews on Yelp, but my experience was somewhat underwhelming.  I had the low carb breakfast, husband had the AZ burrito.  Low carb breakfast had a very good flavor, but way too many oils.  Oily salad dressing, drizzled with an oil-heavy pesto, two eggs cooked in oil, and then an avocado for even more fats.  The flavor was very good, but I just felt like it was a pretty heavy dish for what it should have been.  My husband liked his burrito though!  We also split the breakfast buzz shake.  Our bill was $19.50, slightly over priced in my opinion.   It is small inside, so seating might be an issue if you go during peak hours.  Also, their smoothies and shakes seem to be popular, so the blender is literally always raging... Makes conversation too difficult.  There is absolutely no denying that parking here is a nightmare.  The parking lot is too small to begin with, and then the drive thru line always blocks people in their spot."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I had the croissant sandwich and breakfast smoothie.  The service was great and the pricing is very economical.  It was busy but the line went fast.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and everything here is amazing. I try to eat here as often as I can. The buzz is great to. I wish they would open a east valley location. Service is 5 stars, food 5 stars and drinks.   Parking sucks! so carpool here with friends to make things easier. I usually park two buildings down and walk over. IF I am willing to walk 5 minutes in 115 degree weather, You know its worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to D'lish for the first time just an hour ago, and here I am reviewing it already!  To begin with, I rolled up to the drive thru with my dog in my lap, making a fuss, and the woman at the window could not have been any nicer! She gave Danny (my Pom/Schipperke mix) a treat, which he happily gobbled up.  Next, I ordered the Breakfast Buzz. Took 2 minutes for the drink, and the gentleman who gave me my drink was very friendly!  Finally, my drink- OMG it is SO GOOD! I'm hooked. Chocolate, peanut butter and bananas, what is not to like? I can't wait to try their food!   Friendly service and good food make this place a must!"}
{"text":"Went here twice while in Phoenix last week.   Both times I was in a big rush and it was awesome to be able to get a healthy meal so fast!   REALLY exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and quality."}
{"text":"MAN BUZZ! The breakfast buzz is the ultimate meat head drink. I mean espresso protein and smoothie all in one? Can't beat it!   I have had many things on the menu here and all good. The bowls are awesome the breakfast club is out of this world and the veggie wrap add chicken(come on gotta do it!) is also awesome. Great drink selection, if you like Arnold Palmers ask for the Tiger Woods the next time you go in. E  Atmosphere is super laid back with a great stay. This is the only thing to warn you about it can take some time if you don't call ahead but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Literally come here every week! Try sandwich and smoothie. Dog friendly and outside seating. They have drive through also free parking."}
{"text":"Looking for food? Try somewhere else! D'lish is the go to place for a breakfast buzz!! Best thing on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a secret- AZ Burro. This is the epitome of the PERFECT hungover breakfast spot in restaurant history. When I lived in Scottsdale this was literally my favorite spot ever to go for breakfast. My only complaint about here is that they don't serve alcohol, but let's be real nobody is perfect. \"AZ Burro\" needs to be in the vocabulary of every person that likes to party in Scottsdale. Why? 1. It's pretty much the healthiest breakfast you can get without actually making it yourself 2. It's perfectly filling after a long night out at smashboxx/hefe/etc that ended with a late night at pattie's 3. It doesn't make you full to the point where you can't hit up RnR after to go day party and get started with some bottomless bloodys mimosas 4. (and most importantly) D'lish is drive thru! Making it ridiculously catered to the hungover person. Don't want to see everyone you blacked out in front of last night or run into last night's hookup? No problem. Just make sure that you are sober enough to drive (aka no alc for you Arizona peeps) and drive on through that drive thru people! I know, I know- it just sounds too good to be true but I promise I'm not making it up, this place really does exist. Also the Breakfast Buzz is really filling but I would honestly recommend it as a meal in itself or like a snack or something because I don't know if you would be able to handle it with a meal unless you're really trying to get down then in that case go big or go home. And at the end of the drive thru if you find that all this is just wayyy too healthy or you're over it, then Super Burrito is conveniently located next door. Don't worry, they have a drive thru too so you can still avoid seeing anyone :)"}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot for lunch when I worked in Old Town, if the line wasn't super long. The sandwiches are healthy, all the while keeping it really tasty. Everything I have tried has not disappointed and the coffee is so good. Turkey club was my usual lunch order."}
{"text":"I had the croissant sandwich it was amazing I can't wait to go back ! I wish I knew the girl name who took my order she was very sweet ."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after seeing the reviews and it was just as good as everyone says it is. I got the man salad and although it wasn't exactly what my stomach wanted, it was still really good. The service was very good and the staff was very polite. I will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwiches. I had my first dirty chai here, awesome! Can sit outside with my little dog and enjoy the nice weather."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a drive thru that moves pretty quick if you don't want to go in. Kinda smaller place but you can dine in. Don't blink or you'll miss this place driving by! I primarily stop by for the Vegan Buzz shake. So d'licious!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, and it is nice to have a healthy and affordable option for fast food. Your iced green tea is one of the best I have had. The breakfast buzz is a great option for a breakfast \"shake\" as well, or just a liquid lunch too. A few of my favorites menu items are the tuna sandwich, the chicken panini, or the hummus plate with pesto and chicken. The staff are always accommodating and fast, however I do feel the people they used to have working the drive through line a couple years back were much more friendly and personable, as they always went out of their way to make conversation with you, which always helped break up the monotony of the work day. The staff their over the past year or so just feel like they are just there to work and don't seem to enjoy themselves as much. Also, the parking lot is horrible if you do plan to go inside around lunch time. I heard rumors that you guys would be moving down the road to a bigger building and parking lot? Highly recommended to do so to help your customers out with accessibility. Otherwise, food is always consistently great! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I met Brian S at D'Lish for coffee and conversation.  D'oes that constitute a coffee klatch?  I D'on't know if it D'oes but we sat around for probably a couple hours enjoying the fresh outside air.  As fresh as it is on Scottsdale Rd. anyway.  I had a mocha when I arrived and later a brewed coffee.  Both were, well, D'lish.  So I can vouch for the mocha and the brewed coffee but not the D'caf.  I was wearing my \"Corporate Crime-Capitalized Profits, Socialized Debt\" t-shirt and the guy at the counter called out the other employees to make sure they saw it.    I will D'efinitely keep D'lish in mind and stop in when I'm in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is an envirmentalist drive-through dream. Don't forget to bring your own coffee cup and save a tree.  Had a double espresso [in my mug] $2. and a egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.$4.5, add sausage, [Indeed, you are what you eat.] $1.5 served on a bialy and really I prefer a toasted bird seed bialy.  OK D'lish there is your feedback, See you on the track~"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go this morning because it didn't have the big line it normally does, which im ok with. So I pull up to the window to order and was there for a good 5 minutes just waiting for someone to come take my order. I could see them in there just talking and they looked over at me a few times and never came to the window. So annoyed and hungry."}
{"text":"I love a healthy drive thru! I've tried the breakfast burrito & turkey wrap from here! I want to go back and try their protein shakes :)"}
{"text":"BEST BUSINESS EVER!!!!!  A HEALTHY, vegetarian friendly, special diet accommodating DRIVE-THRU! Where have you been all my life, why aren't you in CA, & how come you are in Scottsdale?! No excuse not to eat right when D'lish-ious, healthy food can be had quick & easy from a window, just like fast food. I also love that they are open early so I could get coffee & a healthy breakfast to start the day first thing in the morning, AND it was friendly, helpful customer service! They also got my order right, with my customizations. (Whatever, I particular, not picky). I got the low carb breakfast with no cheese. I was happily surprised by the portion size! It came with a generous helping of scrambled egg whites, a huge bed of mixed greens, tomatoes, pesto drizzle, & hash. Unfortunately I couldn't eat it all (not even close!) & it was left to sit & die in my car under the hot AZ sun :(  I wish I could come back, & I know I will if I am ever in Scottsdale again! You go, D'Lish!"}
{"text":"Always D'lish just like the name describes. I have only had a select few items on the menu but everyone of them is in my tops list, and I'm a huge fan of the breakfast buzz! Another great aspect of D'lish is their customer service, sure a little unusual and kinda give off that Cali surfer vibe but they're always working super hard. The last time I went the dude at the window saw the line backed up ran all the way outside a couple times making sure the line wasn't taking forever because this place gets packed during breakfast and lunch. The fact that they work that hard to keep the line moving is awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in AZ.  First of all, the \"buzz\" is one of the best inventions of the 21st century.  It's delicious.  Both breakfast burritos are phenomenal, but my two favorite items are the oatmeal and the turkey club.  They are superb.  I ashamed to have written this much without mentioning the guys that run the place.  They are hilarious and always in a good mood."}
{"text":"Not bad, had the \"humanitarian\" and it was pretty good, not to heavy. Ordered the hummus plate as a Starter, came at the same time as the food which kind of defeats the purpose, but they seemed a little busy so I don't hold that against them. I would suggest take out because this place is super small, and me and my girlfriend both had to pee really bad but there was no restroom. All in all I would go back again if I'm on that side of town, but I was not blown away like everyone in yelp seems to be."}
{"text":"A. Delicious + Affordable B. Fast + Amazeballs ©. All of the above  I've been looking for a place exactly like this. It's healthy, quick, affordable, tastes fantastic; perfect place to stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"Get the breakfast buzz shake!! Great for any chocolate lover. They also cook a fried egg perfect every time!"}
{"text":"I was craving a salad and decided to try this spot since it's closer to my house.  I ordered the kitchen sink salad via drive-thru. At $8.25, this salad is extremely disappointing. Small portions and just bland! This salad left me very unsatisfied and full of regret. I can think of plenty of other things to spend that $8 on.  Next time I will just go to my usual salad spot (salad and go) where portions are bigger l, tastier, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I've dined in for breakfast twice. Friendly and always willing to assist.   Az burro is amazing!   Almond buzz's are on point! Lactose intolerant so I request almond milk.   On a low carb day I \"build my own\" from the sides. 2 Eggs and chicken sausage both come off the side menu. Inexpensive and delicious!   Definitely recommend to anyone in the area -- friendly, great customer service, clean and nice, and great healthy options."}
{"text":"The staff members are the sweetest and the food was without a doubt 5 stars. If you haven't tried there traditional burrito or any of there breakfast items yet you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Had the AZ burro and was great! Egg whites w turkey and avocado wrapped in a tomato tortilla. They have a breakfast menu that is also served during lunch. Everything looked affordable.   Will try the soup next time (my gal pal had it for lunch) or the burgers. Vegetarian options are numerous and service was quick.  You do have to bus your own dishes but that's not a problem.   Located right off light rail line in Tempe."}
{"text":"Finally dried out this healthy alternative to the former McDonald's restaurant. I have been very excited to see the change made at this property. Went in with a couple friends for lunch. The staff was very friendly and there is a broad selection of breakfast and lunch items.  My one friend had the California club sandwich which has egg bacon smoked turkey tomato avocado pepper jack and pesto on a toasted artisan bread. He has been here number of times and it is his favorite sandwich. I had the \"man\" salad which has in the center a avocado stuffed with homemade tuna salad which was excellent it is served on a spring mix of greens there was chicken breast bacon feta and tomato. I asked to try to different dressings on the side and they were very willing to accommodate. The seating in the restaurant is comfortable they have an area with sofas that Makes for a nice place to hang out. I will start them with a four star rating. And when I go back I will try a few other items and update the review at that time"}
{"text":"Love the fact that i can get myself something while getting a little doggy bag for my fur baby! Also the people there are so sweet!! I just moved here and this is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and awesome breakfast sandwiches, well worth the trip. The California Club is an excellent pair with a fresh cup of coffee, staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"The customer service was phenomenal made it feel like it was a picnic kinda place felt just at home. The food and drinks were amazing especially the breakfast buzz . I would recommend this to anything who loves to eat healthy. Definitely a great breakfast and lunch place for family's and friends"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and i's favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale! Every time we are even remotely near Arizona we make the trip to this place! It's all about the breakfast buzz and the California club sandwich. We will continue to come to this place as long as we live!"}
{"text":"I have two words for you... breakfast buzz. Stay warned its an alternate for a meal.. but it is amazing. Add some soy or almond milk and an extra shot of espresso and its golden.   Best part of the morning."}
{"text":"First of all, the Breakfast Buzz is a MUST TRY! It's so good & will wake your ass up!  The Top Notch (black bean quinoa) Burger is also really yummy. It's definitely my go to for when I'm really hungry.  I'm not particularly a huge fan of the egg they put on some of their items, it just tastes a little weird to me.  P.S. If your headed to check them out for the first time, keep an eye out for that that turn into the drive thru, it kinda comes up out of nowhere.  I always almost turn right into that \"well bar\" that sits next to it."}
{"text":"Totally chill is da werd. Extremely friendly and helpful behind the counter. Sociable friendly peeps."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!  Had the California Club. Probably the tastiest I have ever had. My friend had the chicken breast panini which was also very good."}
{"text":"Being new to the neighborhood, I was seeking out unique places to get a good cup of coffee.  I like to give the locals some business once in a while.  I find their coffee is often better too because it has to be.  This place is great!  They have a drive through (majorly important) and their coffee doesn't have that burnt taste that you get at Starbucks.  The service was really efficient.  I want to go back to hang out for a while some lazy Saturday or Sunday morning.  It seems like a great place for doing that."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. If your looking for a d'lish breakfast or brunch, this place is a pass. The breakfast sandwiches are fine, but nothing special. The chai is lackluster. When I go out for breakfast I like to order something I cannot easily duplicate at home- nothing on the menu is special.   The line boggles my mind. I'd say if you're looking for a drive-through meal your fine here."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place.... really really wanted to.   Horrible service, I mean absolutely horrible.   I arrived and was starting to say what a friend recommended to me but I couldn't remember the name of it and the guy behind the counter snapped and cut me off and said \"I hear that ten times a day.\" Well buddy since you've heard it before, I can understand that working in the service industry, you'd not expect to hear it again (sarcasm.) Whatever, I made my order and was told to go relax at a table. Well, I relaxed for 18 minutes with no food (turkey BLT I ordered) and watched everyone else get their food. I got up and asked if I was forgotten and there was absolutely no apology offered, but said they would bring it to me.   When the guy brought over my sandwich, he kind of slammed it down on the table and walked away. No apology still, no offer to refund my meal, no come back later and try us again. They were just extremely rude about it. I understand, it happens... It's part of life, but they acted as if me not getting my food was a bother to them.  Horrible customer service. I'll tell everyone I know about this story. Nobody should be able to treat their customers like that. A simple \"I'm sorry, come back and see us again for a free coffee\" or something to that effect would have gone a loooooong way.   Too stupid to get it probably. Or maybe because I didn't have a rat-tail with a mohawk, a basketball jersey, converse shoes, and an obvious roid rage attitude, they just didn't care."}
{"text":"We were looking for something outside of your typical junk fast food. We saw this place and give it a whirl. I wasn't too thrilled about their coffee beverage much like a frappuchino, but not! But their food was good, the bread was soft. And I really like their version of oatmeal."}
{"text":"I could probably eat here everyday if it was closer to me! What I love is the portion size, it's sooo filling, you can order any sandwich at any time of day, the consistency of the meats, quality and every sandwich I've had tastes the same and how efficient the place runs. I wish that they would've told me they did punch cards and I also think it would be more fair to get a punch per sandwich, not per day. Even tho we spent $60+ on sandwich's for the girls at work we were only given one stamp because the girl said they were per day. I mean not a big deal but I just don't see how that's fair to get one stamp on spending that much on multiple sandwich's compared to a person ordering one sandwich?"}
{"text":"California. Club. All day long. Strangely wasn't really that big of a fan of the breakfast buzz but it was still good.  Maybe too much peanut butter for my taste."}
{"text":"This little gem of a drive thru has fantastic food and coffee. They're veggie breakfast burrito is excellent with portobello mushrooms and a red pepper tortilla, i plan on returning for lunch some time soon."}
{"text":"Decent, affordable breakfast spot. I am not a vegetarian but I do like their humanitarian wrap. They have free refills on some drinks if you are dining in and they even have a punch card so that their regulars can get free drinks. The staff is very friendly. I know a lot of people love the drive-through (and it gets super busy), but I do like the patio on a cool morning. They have free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and checked out D'lish after one of my co-worker's recommended it.  We can't get enough!  Great coffee, creative and tasty healthy food and coffee that is expertly made.  I recommend the carmel, the mocha and my husband likes the Buzz smoothie.  The quinoa oatmeal with rice milk and fresh fruit is d'lish as is the california breakfast sandwich which is the perfect balance of flavors on a ciabatta bun.  The employees are so much fun and are friendly and fast to get you your order. If you're in South Scottsdale stop in, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Updated review, they took care of my concerns and I still come here often for a Cali breakfast club and a breakfast buzz. Good people, good food."}
{"text":"Shit, I am so bummed I didn't have the same experience as the others did here. Maybe I just showed up on an off day. My gf and I tried this place out and I was really shocked at the letdown. I ordered a bfast sandwich and it arrived cold and really didn't have much flavor. I didn't try anything other than that so maybe there are better choices that I missed. Hopefully we will be back in the area and can give it another try. Yelp has never let me down so it deserves a second chance. I will write another review after my next experience."}
{"text":"Super yummy breakfast sandwiches though I have mine made into wraps. Wicked awesome dirty chai!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in D'Lish! This used to be my fave Tempe spot but recently it's been awful! The past 2 times my order has been wrong. Today I waited 30+ in the drive thru... Most of the time I was sitting at the window after paying. After all that time and getting home, super stoked to eat my sandwich- it was wrong!!! I ordered no tomatoes, well I had lots of tomatoes and the spring greens were missing. I'm a little peeved after paying 7+ bucks and all of that time to have an incorrect order. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Their food is great - i've had the veggie frittata and the house style veggie burger, both are pretty amazing. Especially the burger. I'm not vegetarian, but i love a good veggie burger as something healthy & different, and theirs is quite possibly one the best in town. Including the ones i've had from full blown sit-down restaurants. Too many places just slide a veggie puck out of a box and throw it on a bun. Not these guys. Also, their coffee and iced tea are pretty dang tasty.  Only problem I ever have here is the wait. Definitely a place you have to be patient at.  Maybe it's better if you actually go through the drive-thru - I always just walk inside. Also, for $8.50,  was a little surprised that the burgers don't come with any sort of side item. Not a deal breaker, just something to keep in mind. And I'd probably come here more often if they had hours that extended into the evening."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, as well as the location in Scottsdale. Both are always tremendously busy, which I can typically deal with. I've tried a few things, and really the veggie & house frittatas are the only things on the menu which I feel aren't overpriced for what you get, but their food is good, so this is - was - an occasional stop for me.   Today though, after waiting at the counter for nearly 5 minutes, someone finally came to take my order... Only to refuse to make me the thing I wanted.   Yes, you read that correctly. He \"offered\" me something else from the menu because the frittatas apparently \"take to long to make, and we're really slammed.\" I was beyond stunned, and left out of pure principle. I can think of 9 other better ways to handle that situation. Even worse, I think the guy helping me was the manager. (Here's an idea; advise me that there will be a long wait, offer me a complimentary drink, maybe even bump an order or two ahead of mine so it doesn't cause a backup. It wasn't like I was in a hurry - I even brought a book to hang out for a while!) If an item on the menu is that much of an issue, it shouldn't be on the menu.   I really hope owners peruse these reviews from time to time so they can address this sort of atrocious customer service... Not that I'll ever be back to find out, but they might like to know how their business is being handled."}
{"text":"Favorite place to stop after hiking Camelback!  I love this tiny little place on Scottsdale.  Its the best spot to grab a quick bit to eat or some coffee.  The breakfast sandwich is the best!  I love that several of the items on the menu are vegetarian or gluten free.  The staff are always the friendliest people around.  I'm hooked on this place!"}
{"text":"Last day of class for my son in college, so I told him I would take him out for breakfast . . . we have been driving by this place all sememster and decided to try it . . . and was very glad that we did.  I ordered the House Fritatta and a Four Berry Smoothie . . . but was informed that the Four berry Smoothie was out of season.  Well, if that is the case . . . take it off the menu.  So I had a Strawberry Banana Smoothie . . . and that is why the lost a star.  The House Fritata was unbelievable . . . hot and full of flavor . . . The Strawberry Banana Smoothie was pretty good also . . . but I would bet . . . not as good as the Four Berry Smoothie.  Definately a place I will be stopping back at . . ."}
{"text":"D'Lite is a delight for tasty breakfast burritos at a good price.  I live nearby and occasionally will buy myself breakfast on the weekends after a workout. They had been on my to-visit place for awhile.   The weekend drive thru lines can be a little long, but their food is totally worth it. I pretty much get just the Low Carb Breakfast sans tomato in a wrap. Yeah you're getting carbs with the wrap, but it's absolutely delish. And it's a fairly hefty wrap, totally worth the cost.  Every time I return, I mean to try something else but I keep going back to LCB wrap."}
{"text":"Ive only been there once, but I can't wait to go again. Im actually writing a review because I just looked to see if they were open on the holiday haha anywho, I went through the drive thru and I kept thinking the guy walking around the cars was creepy with his big smile on his face but then once we got up to the window to order, low and behold it was him! He is what every restaurant should have as a front house man and I can't wait to experience D'lish again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for healthier breakfast. Sat outside and enjoyed the weather. We will be back."}
{"text":"Much bigger inside than appears from outside!  Very cozy, great menu, great options, super friendly.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I've only had the breakfast buzz and it was tasty...lots of healthy menu choices and we are looking forward to returning soon ....  Thanks"}
{"text":"I believe that this restaurant is very overrated.  If you try going on the weekends the line of cars is out into Scottsdale Road, but I'm not sure exactly why.    The food is alright, nothing too special.  The prices are decent.  They do offer a lot of vegetarian options, which may be pulling in a lot of customers.  My biggest complaint is the service, which is truly horrible every time I go.  All the employees seem to be high school or college kids who absolutely HATE their jobs.  I am not exaggerating when I say that you will get significantly better customer service at the McDonald's across the street.  They have screwed up my order the last 2 times I went through the drive through.  I had to park two stores down and walk back, when I explained the mistake they tried blaming me for it-  I don't know how I could be more clear than saying \"A Traditional Burrito with sausage, please\"?!    I don't mean to rant, I apologize.  It's just exceptionally poor customer service and the food is average at best."}
{"text":"Can they fix the pothole in the drive-thru already?   Also, waiting 20 minutes before my order is even taken has me considering other places to go to for my \"breakfast buzz.\"  The breakfast buzz is usually spot on and d'lish, but the last 2 times I've gone, it tastes like I swallowed vitamins-without any water. Gross. I know vitamins are an ingredient, but it shouldn't be the only ingredient I taste."}
{"text":"You might think that healthy fast food might be unappealing but do not let that hesitation keep you away from trying this place.  Knowing that it's healthy and tastes wonderful will now make me a regular customer."}
{"text":"I had the burrito and a sugar free vanilla latte, coffee is bold, bitter bold at first but you get use to it. The burrito had a sauce that was more of a marinara, still good! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Great food, great concept!  We kept going back!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is just great. The staff is friendly, serive is quick and if you just want to hang out and use the wifi that's cool too. They offer good coffee, good sandwiches, and good conversation. I have nothing bad to say about this awesome little coffee shop."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so gave this place a shot. I ordered a the California Club and for myself it did not seem worth what I paid (over $7). It was very bland in my opinion that I should have just made my own breakfast sandwich at home or went to McDonald's instead. My friend ordered some type of protein drink and he really seemed to enjoy it. The girl who took our order seemed bored, but I was bored eating the sandwich so I get it.   I do like the concept of this place but I would prefer a Salad and Go to open near me. The drive through was also a pain in the but because there is small, limited space for a drive through. We ended up parking and going inside because the drive thru line was so small we would have been pushed out onto the street if we waited in line."}
{"text":"I am so grateful that Yelp on my phone steered us to D'LIsh. We had planned to follow up a great dinner at Green, just down the street, with breakfast at the same spot, but Green was closed. No problem! We drove up to D'Lish and had a great breakie of the California Club breakfast sand and a veggie sandwich. The coffee with first-rate, and the staff was super cool to a couple of out-of-towners who were gawking at all of the outstanding options on the menu board. Too bad we had a plane to catch. We would have stayed for lunch. PS Get the Breakfast Buzz."}
{"text":"Healthy breakfast food spot with a super tasty 'breakfast buzz'. A must try for the coffee drinkers out there. Especially in the AZ heat. This will get you cooled off and energized. I recommend the Cali club to go with it."}
{"text":"Hit this place up while on vacation for spring training was looking for something fast and healthy man this place was sooo goooood!! Love the breakfast burritos and that fresh squeezed orange juice!! Definitely will be hitting this place up again next year when we come back for baseball!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical when I asked Siri for a good place to get breakfast being an out of towner.  I was not disappointed at all with D'lish as the selection.    I was looking for a light easy breakfast, and went with the quinoa oatmeal.  I was a bit nervous having oatmeal without the oats, but they nailed it.  The fresh medley of fruit , the vanilla macaroon granola, and everything else just mixed perfectly.  Will return without question.  Can't wait to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"The breakfast buzz is very addicting. I love how they use pesto on their breakfast sandwiches. I have not tried anything that I have not liked from their menu."}
{"text":"So amazing! Love this place! They have fast healthy food which makes eating great so easy!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place...food, vibe, price, service."}
{"text":"Breakfast Buzz is literally the best thing that could ever happen to your tastebuds. Staff is always so sweet- even gives my puppy a treat when I take her to the drive thru with me. My favorite breakfast place BY FAR!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Love the burritos and lo-carb breakfast! The burritos have these awesome egg whites that are just perfectly cooked.   The breakfast buzz is probably the best shake I've ever tasted. It's also huge, so it's a better value than most. I love the mix of chocolate, peanut butter, banana, and coffee.  Any time I'm in Phoenix I make it a point to go here."}
{"text":"Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.  When I ordered, the server suggested a \"Sexy Dirty Chai\", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)"}
{"text":"The staff is very young and friendly, and I enjoyed chatting with them while I ordered. I ended up trying out two customer favorites, The California Club and the Breakfast Buzz.  The California Club has cream cheese, avo, egg, bacon, cheese, and pesto on a bun. It was good, but I kind of thought that I could whip this up in my own kitchen easily, and I think I even used to eat a similar sandwich in college so maybe that's why it's so popular at this location. Either way, didn't do much for me. But luckily I had the Breakfast Buzz, too. And whoa- the Breakfast Buzz was redemption! It's simply a must-order and you have to make room for it: vitamins, peanut butter, coffee, and protein all in one. I thought it was going to be too peanut-y or too protein-y but it was a perfect blend. I drank the whole thing and felt like a superhero without the bad effects of an energy drink (racing heart, etc.). Stop by here if you need a quick pick me up and are looking for healthier, fast-food options."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet aside from VERY limited seating. Their protein bowls and veggie bowls are amazing and it's always a struggle for me to finish. Thanks for giving me the energy I needed to knock out the rest of my crazy work day! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Loooooove their veggie bowl! Protein bowls are amazing too. Heck just about everything is great! Small seating area but definitely a place I like to order ahead and then grab to go!"}
{"text":"D'Lish was a random find for me and a friend, as we were looking for a more palatable option than our standard Dunkin Donuts hangover breakfast. I was surprised to have not heard of it sooner, as it was nearly within walking distance.  I perused their menu on their website, had a game plan then headed in. The seating area is small but not cramped, and is tastefully modern and cozy. The two other girls seated inside with me were both wearing Tori Burch flats, so I knew it was a little more highbrow than your standard hipster hangout. I ordered a vegetarian breakfast burrito, and brought back a classic breakfast burrito for my friend. They were quite tasty- very fresh and not greasy. I also had the \"sexy dirty chai\" I read so much about (a chai tea with coffee and vanilla) and it lived up to all expectations. I'm craving one right now, as a matter of fact.  Since then, I've also tried their yogurt parfait with fresh seasonal fruit and it was amazing as well. Their bagels are soft and delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying a Bialy sandwich next. Everything I've tried has been of good quality and freshness. I have yet to be disappointed with the food or the friendly service.  My only issue is that I don't think they quite have their \"flow\" down yet. Both visits took considerably longer than they should have for a small to-go order. It was much faster to phone in my order and pick up at the drive through window, rather than order and wait inside. Plus, when I used the drive through, I didn't even have to put on pants to go get breakfast. Does it get much better than that?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Do yourself a favor and try the Breakfast Buzz! The food is healthy and delicious as well. This is my weekly go to spot."}
{"text":"They're on to something. Ton of healthy options, including gluten free wraps and burritos (and they ask if it's for severe allergies - thankfully mine is not, good coffee and lattes (almond milk) plus a breakfast buzz protein and vitamin shake with espresso. Yum! Clean, good place to eat. Friendly staff that seems engaged."}
{"text":"Great cafe with plenty of healthy vegan and GF options. The wifi was strong and it's a good place to get some work done. Plenty of seating but the music is a bit too loud. Love the specialty smoothies!"}
{"text":"It is D'lish.  The AZ Burro is real tasty as is the salsa on the side it comes with (at just under $8). Healthy menu options for Breakfast/Lunch.  Small location with seating for about 15+ inside, Parking is very limited.  You must have patience during busy time with parking and leaving - it has a pretty solid drive through line.  There is a small patio that seats 6 i think.  In the 20 or so minutes I spent inside - I have NEVER seen a more physically fit clientele come and go.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I wish they opened earlier since I wake up really early. Good coffee and  good food. I think it's a requirement that you are good looking to work here."}
{"text":"I made the wise decision to bail on my hotel continental breakfast this morning and discovered this amazing joint. The California Club may well be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had! I highly recommend you give this particular menu item a shot. I have a few more days left in Tempe and will, no doubt, be spending my mornings here. I also tried one of their daily special teas (cactus blossom) and found it quite refreshing and palatable."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch after driving by frequently and hearing good things fro coworkers. It's a solid spot! When you walk in you get a definite modern coffee shop vibe, there are comfy looking chairs to the left, tables to the right and a larger community table hi-top right near the counter. They had a good playlist on too if I do say so myself, lots of older pop songs.  You order at the counter and get a number, then they bring your food out to you. They also have a drive thru! I only got the tuna salad sandwich cold (you have a choice of cold or hot) and water but I was really into the sandwich! The tuna itself was delicious, and had feta, white cheddar along with tomato, cucumber, lettuce and onions on wheat bread. It hit the spot and was better than I've had at other places with similar lunch fare.   I saw several other menu items I'd like to return and try, not to mention what looked like a great tea/coffee selection. My coworkers got the rice bowl and the chicken panini and liked their choices as well. I would recommend if you are looking for a healthier lunch and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's been 7 months since I made the move from PHX to NYC and I still think about D'lish.  It's a small joint and sometimes takes awhile if the line is long, but the awesome service & delicious food are well worth the wait.  Get addicted like me and order these:  - The California Club - The Man Salad (sub blue cheese dressing w/ balsamic vinaigrette) - The Breakfast Buzz (w/ almond milk) -- this is the only coffee/espresso related drink I've ever been able to enjoy.  I've never been a fan of coffee or anything that tastes like the stuff, but this drink defies all odds.  It's like drinking a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Whenever I make it back to the desert... D'lish, you're my first stop."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome breakfast.  If you like to eat healthy organic food, you would like this place.  I tried their \"oatmeal our way\" which was made with quinoa and fresh fruit and I loved it.  Also their breakfast buritto was really good.  We were in Scottsdale for a few days and we ate there every day."}
{"text":"I cannot explain how much I love D'Lish! I tell everyone about this place.  One day I just so happened to get my oil changed at a shop down the street. Starving for some breakfast goodies, I walked down the street and coincidentally ran into D'Lish. I ordered the California Club with a iced French Vanilla Latte. At first I was a little reluctant to try the California Club because anytime I have ever had anything \"healthy\" it turned out to be a let down. Thankfully when I ate the California Club I was  delightfully surprised. Ever since then I have continually come back to D'Lish. They have a drive thru as well which is extremely convenient for someone always on the run, like me!"}
{"text":"Speedy efficient and friendly service, average food. Had the California club and thought it was nothing special. Lemonade was great and tasted freshly squeezed...Overall average"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, very fresh and always high quality.  Service is great and the stuff is very friendly.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really great food. This used to be where McDonalds is at. My coworkers love the food here so I gave it a shot with some company. We got the house, four-berry, and orange glorious smoothie. The best one was the house smoothie. Orange glorious tastes like perfume. Would not recommend that one. The southwest rice bowl is really great. So is the turkey club sandwich. The best sandwich was the chicken breast panini. Will be back another time. It was filling."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've lost count of how many dozens of times I've eaten here in the last few years.   My go-tos are the nuts & berries salad, the humanitarian wrap, and the mushroom bisque. Love their egg sandwich on a bialy, too. And I really love that I can get breakfast anytime.   Healthy and d'lish."}
{"text":"Literally d'lish. I think I've had and loved everything on the menu. Nuts&berries salad, california club, turkey club, southwest burrito bowl, protein burger, ...everything. healthy and amazing."}
{"text":"The ultimate java drive through joint! Coffee is aromatic and sturdy. Much like my Aunt Miriam in Berkley. Staff is SO friendly and accommodating. I've never been inside, so as far as I know they are only torsos serving me. I've had the breakfast burrito and it was perfect for eating in the car. Yes, I was driving and eating. Bad driver! Bad! At least I wasn't texting! A couple of times I've had our dog with me and they always throw in a Scooby snack for Emilie. This is the obvious alternative to Starsucks. And if the line gets too long, they come out in person to take orders and get your morning liquid bean fix started!"}
{"text":"I used to visit the Scottsdale location every payday Friday for work. I went with my sister on a date. I had the D'veggie bowl and she had the southwest bowl. We both loved our dishes. It was a nice healthy break from a long day shopping. The prickly pear tea is my favorite! The Arnold Palmer my sis had was good but the plain black tea from her refill was not so good. Overall the experience the food and the cleanliness was delicious. I just wish they didn't close at 4pm :( it would be a great dinner spot."}
{"text":"I think this place's overall 4 star rating might be boosted by the fact that it's kind of a hip, non corporate chain.   I've visited D'Lish 3 different times and each was a different experience taste wise but every time I never felt like I got my money's worth.  Traditional burrito with bacon was good, but was kind of small and it lacked a little in the flavor category.  Croissant sandwich was OK, kinda small though.  California club was gross, didn't even finish the sandwich; it was very sloppy and would be better if you substituted the egg for more turkey in my opinion.   Everything is fresh and you can taste the quality but I just can't really justify the price.  D'Lish has a drive thru, that is a huge plus, and it's probably the only reason I'll come back.  Just won't be very often."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have been introduced to this place by my coworker. My go to is the DBuzz breakfast shake. The benefits of going often do pay off because they have a rewards program! The food is good as well. Hopefully they make more locations."}
{"text":"Such a great deli! I love this place and can't wait til I visit again to have their shake for breakfast! All my favorite things...chocolate, banana and peanut butter...YUM! And their breakfast sandwiches are DELISH! Such a fitting name. They even have a drive thru! Man, I wish they had one in CO"}
{"text":"Top 3 Turkey Sandwich in town, breakfast burritos are great.  Been to four of the locations and there is consistency amongst all four.  Impressive"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here until I read about it on Yelp. I think it's usually dark when I'm down there and I'm focused on getting into Los.  I knew I was getting a Dirty Chai Latte. Pulled up to one window...should I stay? Go? pull forward? The pressure!  Pulled forward and was greeted by a rather homely looking young guy..ha! Right? Homely!  His shirt said \"wanted\" and he wasn't kidding.  How could he know what was in my head?  Seriously beautiful. I even called my husband to tell him how beautiful this boy was. He's young. I don't know that he's a boy..I'm just sayin'.   I almost didn't want to order my Dirty Chai Latte because I had to say \"dirty\" and I was afraid it would purrrrrr out of me like a cougar.  I managed to order without purring. It was delicious and I was on my way. Life is good."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a healthy, yet quick alternative to fast food. I love to get a full salad and sandwich to have food for the whole day. I haven't really had anything that I didn't like here. I think that when you start looking at all of the ingredients one might start to think what is that or do I like that? I try to just go with whatever toppings are included (barring any allergies) because I have faith that they know what they are doing! I like to introduce myself to new foods that I'm not familiar with because I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but am trying to be more conscious of eating healthy. I'm so happy to have discovered the wonderful treat to your body that is D'lish!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem I discovered. Many healthy options that wont break your wallet. Also love that you can get your food fast without having to be waited on. Excellent spot to stop by for lunch. Love the Man Salad and any of the breakfast egg creations are awesome. Nice atmosphere, free Wifi so i can get my work done. Go check them out asap!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. This place is really popular and busy. It's a tiny place. Most of its business seems to happen through its drive through. But inside its nonstop as well. Not a huge menu, but big enough and with enough variety to make my selection take a little time. The girl was very patient with me. A guy at the breakfast bar suggested the California Club. It's their signature breakfast sandwich. I went with that and a iced coffee. This is a really good sandwich. Artisan bread and all the ingredients are really fresh. Oh and the iced coffee was really good and strong. I really like this place and will come back. If you are looking for a new place that isn't a chain and has a lot of healthy choices and healthy also means yummmy, here is your place."}
{"text":"New concept, great concept, NEEDED concept!  It's new and I think they are going through some growing pain but if they have experienced people running the place verses someone simply interested in owning a restaurant (and there are many like that hence here one day and in 2-3 years, gone), they'll be fine!  They use local fresh meats and veggies and organic -  however no signage letting driver bys know - large window signage will draw them in!  We all want to grab a quick fresh organic lunch or snack to go so God willing they'll be a long term success!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here while we were on vacation. We walked away so impressed with this place and it made me wish there was one of these back home. The food was phenomenal and felt healthy. I felt great and not overly full after eating despite eating a lot. It is a little on the pricey side but I thought it was still pretty reasonable and you definitely get what you pay for. I'd go back here in a heartbeat if I ever find my way to Scottsdale ever again."}
{"text":"Hot off the plane in Arizona... we were on a mission to find me some good Vegan food!  We decided to hit up D'lish in Scottsdale!  This tiny little hot spot, was right off a busy road so naturally we missed our turn the first time, but found that they had a little parking lot located just to the back of it.. This parking lot also served as their drive thru, which a member of the staff actually came out to your car to take your order?  This would become a nightmare later as we were trying to leave the parking lot, since there was a NYC STYLE TRAFFIC JAM behind the restaurant!  We couldn't get out! Oh well that's the only thing keeping this place from being a 5 star!   The food was fantastic! I had the home maid black bean Veggie burger with a side salad!  It would be the first of many veggie burgers I would eat this week, and might have been the best! Really wonderful flavor, topped off with a little hot sauce, (when in Rome)!    We loved the out door seating, and the staff was super nice, as one of them was clearing our table told us of a few spots we could hit up while we were in town!  And gave us directions to Old Town!  I really wanted to try to Peanut Butter Smoothie, it looked and smelled gonza good, but I had to leave some room in my tummy for Beer by the pool!  Next Time!    Great staff, cool little space, only problem was that disastrous parking situation!  Walk here if you can! Or park on a side street!"}
{"text":"Only giving this 1 star because the customer service at this place is abysmal at best. On a taste level, I'd give it a 3.5.  I recently moved to Phoenix and drive past D'lite on my daily commute. I finally decided to try it today. I walked in and told the cashier I needed a moment to take a look at the menu. The first thing he said to me was \"Wow! Why would you steal from McDonalds?!\" Confused I looked around and realized he was making fun of my black-and-white striped dress. \"Ha ha, the Hamburgler wants his outfit back!\" he exclaimed. I wouldn't classify myself as a stick in the mud, but the condescending tone and laugh didn't sit well with me. I disregarded the comment and told him I needed a few minutes to make a decision.  As I  was reading over the menu he was sighing and staring at me (i could tell he was annoyed I was taking so long) I told him I still needed a few more minutes because I have difficulty seeing. He muttered to himself, \"I'm going blind too because of that dress.\" This made me extremely uncomfortable but I disregarded the comment because I really wanted to try this place, and I was too hungry to go somewhere else.  When I asked him where the kids menu was he scoffed at me and muttered with an eye roll, \"under D'kids\" and pointed to the screen as though I was inconveniencing him and should have known where that part of the menu was, even though there are 5 screens with 3 in awkward places.   I ordered my food (to-go, even though I had originally intended on eating in the restaurant) and left as fast as I could because I was so embarrassed from the comments made.   There was another woman leaving at the same time as I was. She walked towards a wall thinking it was the exit door. When she turned around and left, the same cashier who had made fun of me started laughing and said, \"That's the only reason I work here! To watch people do that!\"  I'm not sure if that guy was having a bad day or if that's his general attitude but it definitely left a poor impression on me. The ambiance of the store is cute, the menu has a lot of tasty-looking offerings, but today's experience has left me wondering if I will give D'lite another try.   I ordered the humanitarian wrap with a cactus green tea, turkey wrap and kid's grilled cheese. The food was excellent and the restaurant's location is so close to my work and home that I could see myself coming here multiple times a week. After dealing with that cashier I can't say I'll come back. If I do order, it will most likely be through the drive-thru, so one can only hope that I'll have a better experience with that."}
{"text":"This place is terrible at customer service! I went through the drive thru and was greeted at first but said i needed a min to decide. Then i had to yell  several times to get someone to answer when I was ready. I think they were going I was going to drive away. The food took a very long time and the girl with the short blond hair was rude, slow and all around unpleasant to deal with. I went there because t seemed like a healthy option food was just okay but definitely did not make up for the terrible service!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to a meeting yesterday and I thought I would give this place a try (I just cannot abide Starbucks burnt coffee). I didn't do the drive through ( I wanted to take a look at the muffins, doctor up my coffee the way I wanted it, etc.). You know, I though it was a nice little coffee place. The muffin was pretty good (although certainly not fresh from the oven...but then what is these days?). The coffee was also pretty good (they didn't have a dark roast option, so \"house\" was it for me...I would prefer a little better selection from a place where the primary business is \"coffee\"). They had to scramble around to get me some milk for my coffee, but scramble they did, and they came up with a carton after a couple minutes of digging in the refrigerator. The prices are reasonable, and that's always a plus. I will try them again."}
{"text":"I must have had an off day.  I ordered one of the breakfast burritos, and I found it to be very plain and without a lot of flavor.  It just did not do it for me.  Perhaps I would go back and try something else.  The customer service was fine.  They can get you through the drive-thru pretty quickly.  My coffee was just ok.  I really do not get the fuss about this place."}
{"text":"If someone asked me my deepest desire while I was sleeping, there's a 94% chance that I'd mumble \"The House-Style Veggie Burger with grilled onions instead of feta, please\".  It's been about a month since I had the pleasure of ravaging this for lunch, but it hasn't left my mind. Even though D'lish was out of buns, the toasted sourdough bread they put it on was good enough for me to consider asking for that instead from now on.  First off, it's only $8.50 for a meal that will keep me full for at least 6 hours after. The burger itself (a mix of quinoa, black beans, and some other nommy things) is massive. It's the kind of burger that squishes out of the side of the bread when you bite into it. Awesome. It's topped with all kinds of fresh veggies, and then the bread is slathered with cucumber sauce on one side and pesto on the other. It's unreasonably good. Sound like a lot? It is. It might be 1,000 calories... but you know what? It's 1,000 calories of really freakin' delicious stuff."}
{"text":"Healthy and consistent.  On the expensive side for a breakfast spot but it should be expensive based on the quality of the ingredients and emphasis on keeping it clean and good for that body."}
{"text":"The other location in Tempe has waaaay better service. If you go to this one, try to stay away from the brunette with the nosering, especially.  The food is good and some would say the food is great, but inside is simple and loud due to coffee machines. Driving through is better.  It's easier to take the food to go but don't go here during lunch. The traffic is so backed up, it's not even safe sometimes. I once sat in the median on Scottsdale Rd for 10 min just waiting to turn into their lot. If you come from the South, cars get backed up in the right lane and actually stop in the road. In a larger town, the cops would be here demanding these guys stop blocking traffic and get out of the median.  I highly encourage you to try the food, however. The other location in Tempe is certainly worth the drive to get there."}
{"text":"Humanitarian with avocado is what I order here.  But I have to drop you down for not having a bathroom. At least give me an outhouse or something.  It's a bit sad when your fav place also has no where \"to go\". I mean, it's kind of embarrassing when I bring a date here and then on the way, I need stop by the local Lowe's/Best Buy in case she needs to use the toilet. I figure that is a step up from dropping her at the gas station, but it still doesn't do much to set the mood, you know?  HEY? I just figured it out! You know how they have BYOB? How about BYOO? Bring your own outhouse. I could carry one of those little plastic things in my trunk...but wait, then there is still no tp, sink, mirror, etc.  OK, just kidding about byoo, but seriously guys, thanks for anything you can do."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time - FINALLY. I've only put that off for a few years. I generally stayed away because I had the notion built up in my head that it was expensive, not-that-great food.  I am happy to say though, that prices are fairly reasonable, and the Top Notch burger I got was so good. Their burgers are all quinoa and bean burgers, so that might've been a first for me. Very interesting (in a good way!)  Overall, I loved it, and I will definitely be back to try.....well, everything."}
{"text":"What a \"D'lite\" this place is! If you're always on the go like I am, sometimes it's a necessity to grab a quick bite to eat. There aren't a lot of quick, healthy, options when you need your food fast (aka drive thru!). So when I discovered D'lite Healthy On The Go from my friend I knew I had to check this place out!   My two favorite menu items are first the Breakfast Buzz!! This is one of the BEST shakes I have ever had in my life. Chocolate, espresso, peanut butter...need I say more?! My other favorite is the California Club. I've tried this as a sandwich and as a wrap and both are equally delicious! The customer service is excellent as well!!"}
{"text":"So far, nothing but good experiences from this place. I haven't been able to delve into their whole menu quite yet but I will tell you that their shake like drink called the Breakfast Buzz is probably one of the best shake combo drinks I've ever had.   The Breakfast Buzz has vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate, and it's blended with ice.  My roommate goes there about five times a week, so if that doesn't say something, I'm not sure what does. I've heard nothing but great things about the staff and food from this place.   Just a warning, the drive-thru line can become incredibly long which shows how yummy and popular it is, however, it can be a bummer when you only want a Buzz. SOOOOO my roommate and I usually call and order it ahead of time so by the time we get there all we have to do is run in and pay, no waiting.   It's about a five minute drive from my house which is wonderful, but the Breakfast Buzz is so good, I usually finished a large by the time I get home. It's a problem, I wish I could make it last longer but it's just so freakin' good.   This place is a great option if you're looking for something healthy and delicious whilst out and about."}
{"text":"This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and everyone is great! Duh it's going to be busy and lines are going to be long because it's SO good. Duh it's going to be loud sometimes because it's a small place and blenders are loud. Duh it's not going to be sunshine and rainbows every time but this place has great food, easy selections, and the guys and gals get you in and out of there as fast as they can, NOT to be rude but so you can be on your way. :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING spot for breakfast/brunch. Have not been here for other meals but wouldn't hesitate to come back and try.   My Order:  Croissant Sandwich w/ Portabello soup.  FOOD: 5/5 To begin to explain how amazing this was, I have to mention that I savored every bite and even tried to eat slower with smaller bites because I didn't want the flavors to end. The croissant is rich in flavor and balanced very well. The pesto was my favorite part and would recommend maybe asking for extra.   AMBIENCE/DECOR: 5/5 Small but cozy. It wasn't very busy when I came but can see this place getting quite packed. Drive thru line went out to the street. Parking is a bit of a hassle but there are plenty of nearby establishments you can park at.  It can get a little noisy as well when the blenders are running but it's expected for a small little place.   COST: 5/5 Cost is a bit high but it is obvious they don't skimp out on the ingredients and preparation. The food and the experinece is well worth it. Everything is fresh and healthy.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is really popular. There was constant traffic the entire time. It's worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Met a couple buds from the AOB and S (Female). I picked D'lish so really this was all on me. There are just so many negatives to talk about first, BEFORE I even get to the food. First: Parking is a joke. There is such limited parking in the back of the restaurant that you might as well park down/up the street and walk. Second: There is NO BATHROOM. Now, regardless of whether or not this has been grandfathered into the creation of this place, why would the owners choose to have a \"sit down\" restaurant and then not provide a bathroom. NO BUENO. Leave this place as a drive-thru only and you're fine. As soon as they added the 7 2-tops to the inside and the 3 2-tops to the front porch, they should have added a bathroom. Three: The noise. OMFG. If you're sitting inside, which why wouldn't you, and someone orders a smoothie, fagetaboutit. You cannot hear. It is deafeningly loud. Have you ever been to a Jamba Juice and stood close to the machines when they run them? Well, imagine they picked up the machine and STUCK IT next to your ear. Seriously annoying. And, I will add that I'm obviously not the only one who thinks so because while we were sitting there a few customers sat inside only to move outside after being subjected to the noise and deciding there's no way to have a conversation. Now there was going to be 4 of us and there's no way to seat 4 outside so we tuffed it out inside. Four: Employee. You're NOT right. When a customer complains, brings up something that is making them unhappy or is otherwise not pleased with their experience. Your SOLE job is to fix it. NOT ask questions. NOT make them feel as if they're stupid or wrong. You (employee) simply smile and fix it. I realize it sucks sometimes and you probably want to kill half of the people you deal with on a daily basis. BUT, that's the job you've taken. I'll explain more on this momentarily.  So, T, S (M) and I were waiting for S (F) to show up so we ordered 3 Black Tea's. (32oz $3 ea). We took the 2 2-tops right in front of the counter because the rest of the tables were full. This was when we first realized how loud it was. It was funny but then NOT funny. The smoothie machine was just ridiculous. While we were waiting for S (F) to show up the two tables closer to the window opened up so we moved. Even being 3 feet further away from the noise had to help, even if it was just the tiniest bit.  So now we come to our problem with our server / employee. 2 of our Black Tea's tasted like crap. Actually, they tasted like there was Fish sauce with the tea. T said he thought it was because they were using Scottsdale Tap water. Seriously? Does Scottsdale Tap water really taste that bad? I live in Chandler and if my tap water tasted this bad, I would have moved long ago. The thing is, only 2 of the 3 had the taste and they were all the same drinks. Hmmmm. Regardless, we got the 3rd degree about it when we wanted to change them to green tea to see if there was a difference. There was. Then we were informed that they had gotten a new brewer the day before and maybe this batch, which they brew and then put in gallon water jugs to store, might be the culprit. EXCUSE ME. I assume they've run a few batches through the machine so we all agreed we thought this wasn't it. What I did think was the culprit was the gallon jug of Black Tea that had 1/23 date written on it. I doubt the tea was brewed a week ago, but, the plastic jug could have old dried tea rotting away on the inside. GROSS. Use a jug and then recycle it. Not a place to cut corners.  Onto the food. Only S (M) and I ordered food. I ordered the Southwest Rice Bowl ($8.25).  Steamed basmati rice, chicken breast, broccoli, shaved corn, black beans, enchilada & creamy cucumber sauces, topped with fresh cilantro & a side of toasted bagel chips. This was yummy. I think the portion size was a little wimpy, but the taste was great. Winner winner Rice Bowl dinner.  S (M) ordered The Man Salad ($8.50). House made tuna salad & sliced avocado served on bed of spring mix greens, chicken, bacon, feta, & tomato with a side of black bean azuki chips & creamy cucumber blue cheese dressing. S (M) said this was a great salad. All the flavors mixed very well together. Another winner.  So the problem is, there were just so many negatives BUT the food was great. So, use the drive-thru and get a 5 star experience. Stop and eat there, not so much. Since we ate there, this review is based on our experience dining in.  No Bathroom. Crappy Parking. Loud Machine. Not the best customer service. Great Food. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through this morning, so my review is based solely on my experience there and the food. The staff was friendly, efficient and everything I ordered was correct so that was good. However, I found the food and drinks pricey for what they were. I ordered a large chai latte, a large strawberry banana smoothie, a California club breakfast sandwich and a house black bean quinoa burger. The chai latte was fine. The smoothie was very large but it was a bit sweet, could've done with a bit of acidity like orange juice. The sandwiches were pretty small for $9 each. The Cali club was good. The bread is soft and fresh. The black bean quinoa burger was good but out of proportion. Too much black bean quinoa patty to bread and toppings. I asked for extra cucumber sauce, which was wise, because it would've been very dry otherwise. The outside of the burger was crispy and dry while the inside was total mush and falling apart. It had good flavor but the structure was really lacking. A $30 mediocre breakfast, probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sandwich. I had this place bookmarked for when I was in the Phoenix area and decided to stop here before heading back to Tucson. I had the turkey club and a dirty chai latte and enjoyed every minute of it. Everything tasted fresh, bacon was crisp, bread was delicious. Love that their food is healthy but delicious. Can't wait to go back for some more!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love it after reading all the wonderful reviews, but unfortunately, it didn't hit my wow factor!  I ordered the California club for my hubby and I got the oatmeal with all the yummy fruit. All in all, after having to wait twenty minutes in that long line of cars I wouldn't go back. Sorry D'lish. You didn't make my breakfast roster."}
{"text":"It was my first time here to grab a quick breakfast before my 6:30am meeting.  I ordered the protein shake and I really liked it. I have to get less chocolate in it since it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I also ordered their quinoa oatmeal and was not impressed. I guess I had no idea on what I was ordering or what it would have tasted like but my taste buds did not like it. I have read that the California Club is the way to go for your morning fix. I will definitely have to give this place another try for a healthy breakfast."}
{"text":"Hidden a bit, but worth the search.  Breakfast was very good, fast, and fresh.  We had the California Club and Breakfast Burrito (w/ chicken sausage) - 2 thumbs up for both.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots!  Staff is always friendly. Angelica and Aleck are always super helpful and friendly.  Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I've been to D'Lish in South Scottsdale and love it and this place is no different! Quality food, great service but shorter lines and more space!"}
{"text":"Great food, not great coffee. Chad the owner has crafter an excellent menu that is healthy and tasty. All of the salads are killer, but I can't get away from the breakfast sandwiches. I love the California Club. It's perfect. The drive through is fast and awesome. But if you are looking to have a lunch business meeting, don't do it there. The seating is very limited and the blenders are super loud. So it's hard to hear and pretty distracting. Other than that, D'lish is awesome, and I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Apache location and this one several times. Both locations are top notch.   I love coming here for a quick and healthy breakfast. The atmosphere is really laid back and the service is always great. I am a creature of habit but may I recommend the veggie breakfast burrito? Oh. My. God. It's divine. It's balanced and filling-and I feel like I'm starting my day off right. The iced coffees are so yummy, but beware of knowing what size to order... I went for the large Americano once and got a thirstbuster of espresso!   The only drawback of both locations is the parking lot, especially this one. It's quite small and hard to navigate.   Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a place with healthy breakfast and lunch options & great coffee. There's something to satisfy both vegetarians and meat eaters alike!"}
{"text":"I love this drive-thru!!! Sometimes there is a bit of a line but it moves by fast. I usually get the Az burro or the croissant sandwich. Both very good! The breakfast buzz is also amazing. I am excited to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. Breakfast buzz is a perfect post workout meal and any of their wraps are guaranteed to cure a hang over."}
{"text":"At first, I was really skeptical about the reviews regarding the California club sandwich:  it's just a club sandwich and what do you expect to be different from others? But immediately after my first bite of the California club, I know that it is the best club sandwich that I've ever had! It's a perfect combination of avocado, bacon, tomato, and most importantly, the sour cream: it made my day great! With respect to the decor and space, I would say that it is pretty cozy and relaxed, but the space is limited. I would definitely go and try other stuff."}
{"text":"I do not eat from fast food restaurants, but this place lived up to their claim. Delicious qualuty food. Long line, almost no parking, but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Was a little nervous from the partial hippy vibe but was great food and coffee. Price/portion was good as well. Will def do another breakfast/brunch here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I usually get the burritos with turkey meat but I had the SW bowl the other day and it was huge!!! I had to take 1/2 home. I crave the blended-chai and have recently hopped off the unemployed student band wagon to pay for my addiction. Jk. But seriously."}
{"text":"place was swamped and they handled it very well. Food was fresh, delicious, and fast. the morning buzz was delicious too."}
{"text":"They don't call this place D'lish for nothing. They have some really tasty and healthy sandwiches. The place may be very small but the place does have its unique character. They also do serve some pretty good coffee."}
{"text":"Very, very good food.  My only complaint is that it should have two dollar signs on Yelp ($$) because it costs more than $10 to eat there.  I was a bit disappointed by that, but the food was really top notch.  Great service and staff too.  If I'm feeling a bit pricier than I normally am for lunch, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best local spots around.  The California club is one of my favorite sandwiches from anywhere, period.  Smiling faces and healthy eats.  Love this place."}
{"text":"As an out of towner LA vegan, I was skeptical after reading all the rave reviews.  This place is vegan friendly with their Quinoa Oatmeal and delicious coffee!  The guys on duty the Sunday morning we frequented D'lish were super patient and cool.  We'll be back next year during Spring Training!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw D'lish was opening in Tempe as it has been on my Phoenix Coffee Tour (ftw) for over a year, but I never found myself in Scottsdale to try it. So I went there a couple weeks ago and can honestly say it was just okay. Now, I preface this by saying that I have only been there once, they are new, and I didn't order anything terribly complex, but for now...just ok. The BF and I decided to go in instead of driving through. We each got a latte (which are VERY fairly priced at 3$) and I had the bagel and egg sandwich. The lattes were good at the very beginning, but as they lost some of their heat, they became more acidic tasting. I think this may be indicative of good milk steaming abilities and mediocre espresso. Our lattes came out quickly, but we waited about 15 minutes for my egg sandwich (meanwhile a huge table of obnoxious patrons were laughing as loudly as they could next to us in the early AM.....not D'lish's fault, but annoying). I think what may have happened is the people inside get put at the end of the list as far as making food because there are people waiting in the drive thru, so it took much longer to receive food. Anyway, the sandwich was pretty bland BUT I did like that they don't scramble their eggs in the sandwich, they are over hard (like it better over medium, but whatev). I wish they had more variety of bagels and allowed a choice for the sandwich because it would be really good on an everything bagel. Also, their menu states they have assorted pastries and when the BF asked what pastries they had they said bagels and croissants.... not really assorted.... they could probably take that off the menu or add some more pastries. Anyway, I hear their sandwiches at lunch time are really good, so I may try them again for lunch, but for coffee....eh, just ok."}
{"text":"This place has good and healthy food for a reasonable price! The staff isn't always the most friendly, but I am still a regular anyway. I love the breakfast buzz and the low carb breakfast."}
{"text":"D'lish breakfast Sammie with all the fixings. The bread was the perfect compliment- soft and yeasty. The Sammie had egg, cheese, bacon, avocado and turkey. Just the protein loading I needed on a cold Saturday morning. It was their Grand Opening and everything was half off !!! Say what????"}
{"text":"Trying out a new location and so far it's turning out to be better than the Tempe location. Alec was the cashier and was very friendly and gave me suggestions for my burrito. They made my food very fast and it tastes delicious. This is definitely a regular place for me to visit and study. Thy provide free WiFi and the food is decently priced."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. We're big on breakfast dates. Went through the drive through the first time and ordered 2 traditional burritos. (Added avocado to mine) There was an overabundance of eggs and hardly any cheese or potato (or avocado)   =(   We decided to give it a second shot, so we drove back, parked, and came inside. This time, we ordered a California Club as well as a Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with cream cheese and sat to wait. As my fiance had his Club delivered, I received news that they had run out of Cinnamon Raisin bagels. Not only was I bummed that they didn't tell me that at the register, now I'm no longer hungry for anything else here. I let the manager know about my first time experience here and instead of having empathy, he couldn't believe that I didn't enjoy the burritos because \"it's his favorite thing ever here.\" Well it wasn't mine. & they offered no incentive for us to come back and try anything else. Sad morning. Unhappy pregnant belly."}
{"text":"Tried this place strictly because of convenience at the time, so glad I did! Great, healthy, fresh options in a cool relaxing environment. Everyone was friendly and the food was delicious! Had the California breakfast sandwich with a caramel latte, both were fantastic. Can't wait to go back and try a salad or sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"So I wanted to write a super good serious review and become like yelp famous and respected but I'm really stoned. The food was really good. Got the southwest rice bowl (I thought it was more of less sauce kinda thing, but there's a lot of sauce, kinda drowned the bowl, still really good tho) and the hummus plate, grade A man,also the breakfast buzz which honestly was awesome :)"}
{"text":"I generally don't believe five star reviews myself, but this place is the real deal. Great coffee, fantastic food, the best service around. The people who work here are genuinely happy that you walk in. They will chat with you if you want, or let you do your work on their free WiFi.  The Breakfast Buzz has been deservingly and glowingly reviewed here at length, and is well worth the hype.  One of the best surprises on their menu is their tuna sandwich. I am extremely fussy about tuna salad, and this one is my absolute favorite. I could go on, but your best bet is to just come on by and see (and taste) for yourself!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love how consistent all the D'Lites are, the South Scottsdale location being my favorite.  Both Nathan and Leonard (managers) are always there with a smile and greeting customers.  Friendly Staff and THE BEST food!"}
{"text":"Best Coffee  Love the chill vibes. Healthy menu options for Breakfast or Lunch."}
{"text":"Love you. Really do. Love you even more because I can't have you.  Because I live in Chi-town and you live in Scottsdale.  Darn you.  I ate here three times. In two days. Yep.  That amazingly good.  Iced tea is the bomb. I loved it. They have great flavors. Protein shakes are delish.  Hence the name of the place.  Rockin' to say the least. Breakfast salad was so good, I now crave it.  Sucks to crave something so far away. Quinoa oatmeal was also wonderful and healthy and tasty.  Basically, I think you are nuts if you don't like this place. I'm super jeals of all of the peeps that live out there that can eat at D'lish whenever they want.  As for people crabbin' about the price?  It's independent.  It's different. It's got a great vibe.  And the food is tasty.  Eat and hush up and enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been coming to D'Lish fairly regularly for about 3 years or so. I enjoy the fact it's not a huge chain and offers healthier food options. I've eaten just about everything vegetarian or fish on the menu as well as trIed the smoothies and tea options. Recently after having been frustrated many times over the past few months I finally had to give up on this place. The parking is situation is horrible or the ability to turn into the drive-thru line. The business basically needs someone conducting traffic duties to control the situation. It really is a huge traffic situation that oftentimes blocks the curb lane and either forces you to be a jerk who also blocks the lane or just give up. The staff typically ranges from barely polite to outright rude and they have no public restroom on the premises so I would recommend against eating in because even washing your hands after or before eating is completely out of the question. While the food is good it's not so amazing as to make up for these problems. Save yourself the aggravation and go to one of the many other options in the area"}
{"text":"Concept is amazing.  Drive thru with  healthy food? Is it even possible? Yessireee! Welcome to D'lish.  The parking lot is EXTREMELY tiny but you can go through the drive thru to get fresh salads or delicious food that's not deep fried with oil and fats.  On top of that, the restaurant isn't very big either - small as well.  My friend ordered a salad - it was large, filling and had lots of goodies in there.   I ordered the hummus dish with feta on the side. I don't particularly like feta...ehhh.... Hummus was delicious and garlicky. The vegetables and pita were fresh and had a snap sound to it as I crunched into the broccoli! *Munch* Yum-O!  Great place to come if you're on the go and want something healthy and quick.   .....Free wi-fi for the win! :)"}
{"text":"The veggie wrap with added turkey was really good. Lite enough not to weigh me down, but a perfect size to not leave me hungry. The only gripe is that their parking situation seemed a bit sketch. There were spaces but it looked like a tight fit. Also their water tasted bad, like tap water from some old pipes."}
{"text":"VERY good, VERY healthy, VERY small! The breakfast fare is delicious, the Breakfast Buzz is addicting and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. Check it out."}
{"text":"Good little find thanks to fellow Yelpers! Nice little hole in the wall / diner, drive-in, and dive joint. Service is great, guys have a friendly and terrific attitude!  Menu is very diverse. My spouse is an RD. LD, and gave it two thumbs up for healthy variety.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Healthy food (and I mean true, healthy food) on the go, this is your place.  I have been to D'lish numerous times and have tried many things and I haven't been let down.  The club sandwich is PACKED and so so good. My usual go to is the chicken breast panini. Also packed with ingredients, my only gripe with this is it usually has a little bit too much pesto but it is still very good. The latest thing I tried was the Humanitarian with chicken. This was so good, it is now my go to meal. The hummus was full of flavor and the sun dried tomato tortilla was excellent.  I've also had their toddy and iced dirty chai and both were good, also.   The wait for food can sometimes take a little while but hey, this place is packed and you can't blame them if it's busy!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast buzz, no clue how something so good can be somewhat healthy for you. Their seasonal smoothie has been the same pear, apricot flavor for almost a year but it's delicious so we definitely don't mind. The California club and breakfast burrito are our go to's. They are bursting with flavor and Very balances. The only critique is the bacon could be crispier, it can sometimes be chewy which some people may like (I like crispy bacon). We ordered burgers one time but should have read the menu more carefully, they are all veggie burgers."}
{"text":"Like the Place! has some covered parking with a menu on it so you can decide what you want before you go in, pretty cool. has a drive thru as well. you can place big orders ahead of time and go through the drive thru and pick it up! how convenient. place has 1 register, so when the place is packed and the drive though is packed, they switch back and forth using the same register. A little annoying for customers and prob the register guy too! get another register! Peeps are friendly, service is great, they get people in and out quickly, so it seems ok. ordered the California Club, place was packed! food amazing, the Tea was amazing too! I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I work a physically intensive job, and I was in a rush before work so I was hoping for a hearty meal before my shift, especially as I had not eaten for 16 hours. However, I was extremely disappointed to learn that they did not take my credit card, so I had to walk out the store without any food that I needed for work. It's no wonder that this place is closing. Good thing Jimmy John's was able to take a delivery to me in a quick and easy manner where I wouldn't pass out from exhaustion"}
{"text":"More of a coffee shop, than a restaurant. (It has a drive thru.). Good coffee/espresso bar and healthful alternative to fast food. It's an order-at-the-counter place with cheerful staff that takes orders and delivers food to your table. Breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito were fresh and tasty -- but more of a \"take-away\" \"to-go\" feel. Small parking lot can get a little jammed up with drive thru traffic.  Good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"We come every weekend for breakfast and our dogs love to come because they typically get a dog treat at the take out window. The last three times the same woman didn't give a treat. The food is always good but we are driving home with with disappointed pups."}
{"text":"Really neat place, only thing stopping me from a 5-Star review was the amount of 311 I had to listen to while I ate"}
{"text":"I don't know how someone could say the service was subpar!!! Every time we come in I'm impressed with how quick and friendly the people working are! I think they go above and beyond actually. Even though it's standard, they always promptly bring out a water bowl for my pup and are sweet to her. They also run in and out to the patio to bring you what you need even though you could easily get it yourself. The food is good and the vegan buzz is my favorite!! They are pretty accommodating about changing things to your need but I'd always love more vegan options"}
{"text":"Although it was a little out of our way, D'lish was worth the drive, times ten.  The guys behind the counter rock the casbah. They inject friendliness like they have a PhD in positivity. I loved every minute of sitting at the counter, I would have gladly swapped my 6-hour passenger seat spot home to LA to sit there and chat and slurp up their complimentary samples of the \"breakfast buzz.\" Apparently it goes by many different names but just ask for the peanut butter thing and your am will forever be changed. The breakfast bagel I had on bialy bread was also top notch, filling, and inexpensive.  D'lish, want to take a road trip to LA?"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to get breakfast on the way to Phoenix Airport. We consulted our trusty Yelp app and found D'lish. It got great reviews so we thought we'd give it a try. When we pulled up, there was a long line at the drive through. I figured this was a good sign. The parking lot is very small and cramped and took some maneuvering to get into a spot, especially with all the cars at the drive through. We wanted to sit and eat so we went inside. The inside is very small and maybe would fit a dozen people comfortably. Luckily, there were only a few others besides us. We were a little confused when we walked in as we received no greeting. Do we just sit? Is there table service? Or do we just walk up and order? After realizing there is no table service we looked at the menu, which was located above the counter. The menu was written very small and was difficult to read. The inside is very loud mostly because of the blenders and the loud music that was playing. It was very difficult to have a conversation there and I could barely hear the woman taking my order. The noise level was so high I can't imagine it's good for the people that work there. I placed my order at the counter and I received a number to place on our table. I ordered the traditional burrito and my wife ordered the frittata. While we were waiting we noticed some not-so-customer-friendly signs. There was a sign that stated no public restrooms. We looked for the restrooms and discovered that there aren't restrooms to use even if your a paying customer. Then there was the old, \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\" Really? Come on. As a paying customer that really doesn't make me feel welcome. Anyway, back to the food. The food came out promptly and hot. My burrito was in a wheat wrap with eggs, potatoes, bacon and cheese with a side if salsa. The burrito was good, but not seasoned. The salsa was from a jar. I know this because I can tell and it was confirmed when I saw the container of salsa in the kitchen. I would of liked some D'lish home made fresh salsa. My wife's frattata was a baked egg omelette with cheese, and vegetables, hashbrowns on a thick piece of white toast. Drizzled on top was a spicy sauce. They also offer smoothies and vita shakes. The food was good, but the atmosphere and service were poor. I think I know why a lot of people were in the drive through line getting food to go."}
{"text":"Great, fast, high quality, and consistent. Always a great option. My favorite is the club and pomegranate green tea."}
{"text":"Swung by though drive thru for a California club sandwich. The drive thru moved quickly because they had workers walking to our cars to take our order and payment.  The sandwich (around $8) was well made... the eggs were cooked differently, really thin somehow?  The pesto and mayo.. everything was great.  They cut it in half and wrap it up nicely for on the go eating.  Great service.  Great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food here is really clean and delicious. The inside is well kept and cared for. Breakfast buzz and burritos are great. My only complaint about this place is the price. We got two breakfast burritos, two waters, and paid around $30 after tip, only to leave still hungry."}
{"text":"Very refreshing to have a place like this around. Food is phenomenal to say the least. I will be trying the breakfast buzz next time after seeing all the reviews. Finally healthy fast food. I would say great food vs fast food. Will be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Love the relaxed atmosphere, the friendly staff, and of course the food!    My favorite thing to get is the low carb breakfast (especially good when you had gestational diabetes),and it hits the spot any time of the day. I love how fresh every ingredient tastes, and the way that they take the care to dress it just right in pesto and vinaigrette yum!  It's basically a salad with eggs and a hash brown on top with avocado.  I also like to get their walnut and berry salad. Can you say heaven in every bite? It's a bit on the sweet side because of the dressing, but it has so much flavor!  I would give 5 stars, but there has been several occasions where I've waited in the drive through for over 20 minutes. Pretty much my whole lunch break. &that was 20 minutes for the line to move, then another 5 to 10 minutes at the window waiting for my food. I get it though, it takes time to make such delicious food and serve it through the drive through."}
{"text":"Trying to eat healthier, yet not starve, and \"the Man Salad\" was pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place changed it's name to d'lish kitchen-- perhaps new owners and worse food? I had wheat bagel sandwhich- bagel was stale sent it back. Tried sesame and that was just as stale. Bad."}
{"text":"Came back here 4 years later when I was in town a couple weeks ago.  The day after partying all night,, we were looking for food that was quick and not too pricey in Scottsdale.  I thought of D'lish because I remember the fresh and healthy menu that I loved when I first discovered it.  Fried, greasy, or heavy food was just not acceptable to me that day.  Sad that I was not able to share that same fresh experience with my friends this time with the food here.  My boyfriend ordered a breakfast burrito and it looked horrible inside once he bit into it. The eggs were green, way overcooked, and didn't really look like eggs.  Just looked like a light green meat patty.  Not sure what happened.  I won't say that I won't come back here ever again, but I hope they'll get back to serving more fresh and high quality food."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced but definitely a hangover cure. Go here and get the California club and a breakfast buzz!!! Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I paid over ten dollars for this salad. I ordered the Man salad. It was not made according to the description given- it was completely absent on any tuna salad and has two small slices of avocado. Additionally, the lettuce was wilted and slimy. I could've made a better salad at home. I will stick with Salad and Go for now for consistent results and much better prices. I realize this location just opened and they may still be figuring things out, but this was a disaster."}
{"text":"Clean, healthy and tastes amazing! Their breakfast buzzes are so good that I pretty much crave one every day. I've also had almost all of their breakfast sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with any of them. The AZ Burro stands as my favorite though.  The inside of this location is roomy and clean and the staff is always helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"I stop by for a quick lunch near work. I've enjoyed several of the dishes they serve here: -The chicken panini ($7.25 with chips); the chicken, mushrooms and pesto were very good. -The Breakfast Buzz (peanut butter-banana-espresso smoothie) -The baja chicken soup and the bagel chips that go with it -Pomegranate green tea (not artificially/overly sweet) -Man Salad (Nice assortment of protein to fill you up) -Lo Carb Breakfast (2 eggs, avocado, & hashbrown on top of a salad) -The AZ burro (I only had a bite but seemed tasty and more filling than the regular sandwiches); saw someone eating this \"enchilada style\" (baja chicken soup on top) and it looked glorious.  Wouldn't try again: The hummus plate. The hummus itself wasn't that great and even though I usually like crudites, the veggies that came with it weren't standout either. Oh well, can't win them all. Won't deduct a star for this because of how good everything else has been.  The guy at the counter was really nice and friendly and didn't rush us to order even though it was getting busy.  Parking sucks (something like 9 spots?) and the drive thru line looks like it can get crowded fast, but I've had decent luck with it after 12:30 and when I call my order in ahead of time.  Also, God help you if you sit inside and someone orders something that needs to be blended (like a Breakfast Buzz). It gets really loud with that machine on. That being said, it's nice to sit at one of the outside tables when the weather is good.  I'll definitely keep swinging by as almost everything I try turns out to be quite tasty. As far as food goes in that area, it seems like one of the better options. Only wish they were open later in the day so I could grab something on my way out of work."}
{"text":"Great spot, great atmosphere !   My husband had the tuna sandwich which he said was the best he ever had- coming from him that is huge. I had the d'veggie bowl- comes hot- not a salad but delicious,  only negative is no bathrooms - so go before you come."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken panini. Supposed to be served on sourdough they gave me plain white bread instead. Wasn't impressed definitely not worth 9 dollars."}
{"text":"We love this fast food alternative! Our favorite is the California club or the naked chicken panini- yum!"}
{"text":"Same awesome menu, great location, convenient drive thru, welcoming and nicely designed interior space, yet poor customer service. Like, really poor. Customer service is the magic that ties everything else together & this location really misses the mark. I've frequented the south Scottsdale location and every interaction with the employees is bright, happy, positive, and really genuine. So I'm completely surprised that this culture and standard isn't upheld at this location. I've been coming here since they opened and haven't had one experience where I didn't feel like my order was an inconvenience. All the girls are short, curt, blatantly unapologetic if an order takes a little longer than normal, they all seem miserable working here, they pass the order out the window and gone in a flash, no \"thank you\", no \"have a great day\", no smile, nada. Completely cheapens the experience. I keep thinking \"it'll be different today\" each time I go, nope. I can an easily make this breakfast buzz at home. Such a shame."}
{"text":"$10.50 got me a 16oz hot, dirty chai and chef salad.   I loved me the hot, dirty chai. Plus, it's just fun to say.   The salad was tasty. Great portion size. Often we think we can stuff our faces with lettuce, turkey slices and eggs...but we can't. Let's face it. D'lish does a great job of making a well-balanced salad.   The guys who run this place are also very easy on the eyes.   The menu is expansive, offering up breakfast choices with lighter fare, including smoothies. Ingredients are said to be mostly organic. Yep, I like this place alot, actually.   And it's very cool they have a drive-thru.   I also dug the music while I was there. It was from one guy's laptop; so you know he's got a great library of tunes. Thumbs up for me.   If you haven't gone here, go. Even if it's for a coffee. You may find, though, that when you arrive, you can't resist their menu options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love how this restaurant makes eating healthy, fast with their drive thru. The Vegan breakfast buzz is my all time favorite! Along with the AZ Burro! The only thing I really don't like about D'lish is that they close at 4pm so I can't stop by after work to get food. Wish they would stay open until at least 7 or 8!"}
{"text":"I have literally been here over 1,000 during and after college. I get the same thing every single time. Cali club, seasonal smoothie, side of fruit. Amazing, healthy, slightly overpriced (but not enough to keep me away). Get this up on Uber Eats and I won't eat anywhere else ever."}
{"text":"okay, i finally know the name of this place. i think it used to have different owners when it originally opened.   i live 5 minutes from here (you know, on the other side of the tracks) and have been going here since it opened a few years ago. the quality of coffee drinks has gone up and up and up since the first time we tried it.   i love their lattes as well as their plain old cup of joe. the service has always been great; typically my dog gets a treat if she's riding along with me through the drive-thru.   great coffee, nice, local spot to support."}
{"text":"Get the breakfast buzz shake! It's the reason I put up with the line 95% of the time. The food is good too, personal favs being the low carb breakfast and the chicken panini. I wish they had a better way of dealing with the wait time in the drive through but I feel like it's worth it when everything is fresh and made to order. Love this gem!"}
{"text":"Super fresh fast fun and friendly !!  Sometimes the line gets super long so I guess not that fast at times . Friendly staff and just love the vibe .  Wish they could tone down the industrial loud blenders they use to make the Breakfast Buzz!  Good concept i would buy into a franchise ..."}
{"text":"Disappointed to say that the quality of D'lite has gone down as the number of locations have gone up. I have always loved D'lite since it was still called D'lish, and only had two locations (One in Tempe and one in South Scottsdale). It helped me survive college when I was too lazy or rushed to cook! Now that I live closer to Arcadia, I have began going to the one on Indian School, however its become a gamble to see if they will get my order correct or if it even turns out decent.   Today I asked for an everything bagel with egg, avocado and tomato. I received a ridiculously small plain bagel with only egg and avocado. I've literally never seen a bagel that small. I didn't notice until I got to my car and didn't have time to go back, as I was on my way to work. Most of the times I get D'lite are on my way to work, so it is frustrating to constantly receive wrong orders that I have already paid for and don't have time be remade.The last few times the breakfast burritos I have gotten were way smaller than usual, soggy, and just gross to be honest. This is the first Yelp review I've ever written in my life. I hate to be that person to complain over something minor, but I'm sad to see one of my favorite places go so downhill."}
{"text":"Really tasty food fast at a good price. We had the California club and the low carb breakfast as a wrap. California club stole the show."}
{"text":"While I love the food here and don't mind paying $10 for a salad, I have to give them a low rating because they nickel & dime customers for everything! Non-dairy dressing for your salad = $1.50 because it normally comes with ranch. Splash of lemonade with that $4 tea = $.50 because they can. Come on. Employees had attitude about it too. Well you know that $2 tip I threw in the tip jar? Why don't I take it back to pay for my splash of lemonade? Even though good food, still leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the food was healthy and delicious, and the workers were friendly. What more could I want??"}
{"text":"Cute little shop on the east side of Scottsdale road.  Minimal seating and parking, but of course they do much of their business through the drive thru.  Employees were very friendly and conversational, and the espresso was surprisingly good.  Prices were reasonable.  Will definitely return any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It doesn't get five stars because the parking and drive thru situation is atrocious. The food however is d'lish (see what I did there). I usually get the breakfast sandwich and a nice tea. For lunch the southwest chicken bowl is SO good. The employees are always  smiling and on point despite how busy it gets!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast buzz here so I drove 15 miles from my house to get it. Shake was great but the girl taking my order in the drive thru was short and not very friendly. After she gave me my change I said \"thank you\" and she just shut the window that was it. No response no have a nice day definitely not the friendliest."}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff, and coffee! If you're looking for a quick breakfast or lunch stop that's healthy and delicious I fully endorse D'Lite. Stopped in the other day and had the breakfast burrito and coffee. In a rush? They have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Great concept!  In fact, had thought about this for so long:  Why isn't there a place WITH a drive-through that actually makes delicious, HEALTHY food?  D'Lish is it. They pride themselves on not serving coke/pepsi products, which I do quite like.   Best dirty chai of my life here. Legit. So rich, flavorful and the espresso was made perfectly. Not over steeped, not burned...not weak, just right! Well, of course their food is incredible too : ) Anything you pick will rock your socks off.  Lemme say, while my dog didn't take the treat they offered (he's a brat lol) - the fact that they offered it was so nice. These folks care about what they're doing, and do it well.  I can't wait to go back and have a meal on the delightful little patio."}
{"text":"The Man Salad! What a great place for tasty healthy fast food. And the people are really friendly. They love what they do and what they do is great. Don't be fooled by the street view. Clean, charming, modern, young, and delightfully d'lish."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger.  Really good ... though needed a wee bit more spice.   Perhaps in the Aioli?   I really liked the bun ...  For the $ expected a teeny side dish ...but nothing?   Ok experience."}
{"text":"D'lish has very delicious food.  This place has very healthy and tasty fresh food.  In addition, they have a major plus with a drive-thru window.  It is a good thing they have that because it gets quite packed with such a small location.  I have had their salads and sandwiches, and so far everything has been exceptional.  During my last visit, I tried the Breakfast Buzz.  The Breakfast Buzz has peanut butter, protein powder, bananas, espresso coffee, and skim milk.  It was a delicious blend of yummy."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, lots of healthier options.  I love that they mark everything for those of us with special dietary needs, like dairy free options.  I have never been disappointed.  You can call ahead and pick up your take out order through the drive thru."}
{"text":"The food was very good and staff was nice. The veggie burrito just seems to be missing something as it doesn't have much flavor to it. The salsa that comes with would be helpful to add flavor but it didn't have any. Ingredients were fresh and everyone else's food was extremely good! I will definitely be going back, just skipping the burrito."}
{"text":"Two words, Almond Buzz! Try it, you will get hooked!"}
{"text":"Two words, Almond Buzz! I could live off these things. I discovered them a few months back and am there almost every morning feeding the monkey. They look out for their customers with a punch card so every 10 you get a free one. Good looks on that! Parking lot can be nightmare but you gotta pay to play. All in all give it a go, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Good fast healthy food. Their protein shakes are great I recommend the breakfast buzz. Some of their menu items are strange which is why they don't get four stars from me."}
{"text":"I can here often for the California club which is my fav!! Today I tried the Burro and subbed the eggs for avocados and it was delicious. The cashier didn't provide the correct change so I will be back to get my funds but that doesn't take away from the quality of their service and food!"}
{"text":"AZ burro, California Club, and of course, the Breakfast Buzz are my go to's. Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese is also a good simple option. The prices increased recently which is understandable since they said they haven't in a number of years. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the California turkey and OMG. My taste buds exploded with happiness. The pesto and cream cheese blended together perfectly. The turkey was good quality, and the eggs were cooked well. The bread really gave it a wonderful texture and flavor. I wish there was a D'Lish closer, but I have no problem making the drive. D'Lish is right!"}
{"text":"I'm ecstatic to find this establishment recently on my foodie run in Scottsdale. I love their mission to offer healthy fast food options to all the busy bees in Arizona. Staying true to the fast food concept, this location is equipped with a drive-thru so their customers can grab healthy food and be on their way to or from work. My two to picks are the Breakfast Buzz shake for my morning routine. This shake has all the protein and caffeine to get me through to lunch. The Breakfast Club is my second choice for when I want to munch my breakfast. Overall, I love the friendly staff, the cleanliness, and the gorgeous decor at this establishment. Give these peeps a visit, you won't be disappointed. Until next time, stay hungry :)."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD - ALWAYS BUSY  That's the sum up. The Breakfast Buzz (banana chocolate smoothie with espresso) is AMAZING!!! The California Club is out of this world. The Oatmeal Our Way is a little odd because it's not oats, it's quinoa. Very filling but takes some getting used to if your mouth is expecting the mushiness of hot oats. The hummus comes with seasoned pita/naan and the smell is a little odd, but it all tastes good.  This place is the BEST fast-ish food place. I can't say 'fast' in all truth because I've often sat in the line for several minutes with other cars behind me. Good news is, that SHOULD mean they're taking time making your food even more awesome and not just slapping it together in uniform fashion like McD's or the like.  If you're coming here, plan ahead and either come early when you know you gotta be somewhere. The food is TOTALLY worth it."}
{"text":"As the name implies... EVERYTHING here is D'lish!!! From the breakfast sammies to the Man Salad to the Breakfast Buzz, I have never been disappointed with the food!!! I do suggest going to the drive-thru, as it can get very loud inside. Plus, the restroom facilities aren't the most accommodating. But the staff is always laid back, friendly and efficient. I do love the Tempe location but it is a little to far from my 'hood but if you are in that area, I definitely suggest making breakfast or lunch there a regular thing... as I do at the Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches for lunch or breakfast, and apparently pretty good coffee as well!! Definitely recommend giving it a try sometime, fairly quick too if there's no line at the drive thru"}
{"text":"Hipster Mecca. I don't get it. I worked next to D'Lish for a while. Went a couple times. Very expensive for a sandwich that is really nothing special with no side or drink. I'd rather spend my money down the street at DeFalco's any day."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot and convenient that they offer a drive-thru. It does get busy so be prepared to wait in line for a while in the drive-thru, especially on the weekends. Big fan of the California breakfast sandwich. Some of their frozen coffee drinks are a little milky and watered down -- I like my coffee drinks STRONG! Still, overall, a very nice breakfast option."}
{"text":"Jump on the Triple B if you haven't already (Breakfast Buzz Bandwaggon). You have literally no excuse not to (they have a Vegan Buzz as well) unless you're allergic to delicious.   You can't go wrong with a California Club either. It's yummy and filling.   Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is their website is outdated in my opinion. I wish it provided more nutritional information beyond the ingredients."}
{"text":"Holy cow, the food here is amazing!  Just a small quick eat place with super fresh and healthy food. They have very a very creative menu with options for just about everyone's diet, including vegi, vegan, and gluten free.  Very friendly service, from people that seem to love working there.  I recommend the cali club the ingredients sound strange, but trust me, it works. Check out the photo that someone has posted of it.  Highly recommended, its a must do in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this in Sacramento.  So many healthy options and variety, quick, and good portions.  The cup sizes are huge so just be careful with that.  We had the California breakfast sandwich and put Sriracha on top, wow it was so good! The next time I'm in town I'll definitely be going back to try something else on the menu.  The parking lot is a little odd and small because of the drive thru but we ended up parking a could stores down and walked right in.  No line and not too long of a wait so all worked out!"}
{"text":"I got the turkey sandwich for lunch and I already thought the ordering was ridiculous.  The line is atrociously long so someone comes to your window, takes your order and takes your card so they can go inside and run it.  Then I get my food and they just handed me my sandwich--no bag! Just the sandwich and napkins.  That's just weird to me.  The sandwich was good but not worth all the hype I've heard about this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  I had the California Club based upon the reviews and my friend had the AZ Burro and we were both very happy with our choices.  Parking is horrible - so just be prepared.  Worth the trip for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich is the California club, if you are not a health nut this is a great option. The mushroom soup is always amazing and you can't beat a drive thru! The salads are great and actually filling, I just wish they were open later, when I want to go after work they are closed. Also the wait is a mixed bag, sometimes there is no line and some times the line of cars spills into Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"Love love D'Lite. Much closer for us than other locations and happily, the food is exactly the same. \"Must-trys\" include Cali Club, AZ Burro, and the breakfast Buzz icy drink."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is good! We came in to eat as it was our first time, but it has a drive-thru.  The servers were great and it seemed like such a fun atmosphere and they were enjoying their time, which made us feel really comfortable.  The food was really healthy and I enjoyed my wrap."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times because it's right across the street from my school. Their tuna sandwich is good, bialys are yummy, coffee is decent, breakfast sandwich yummy but their \"oatmeal our way\" is not my fave. I couldn't finish it, it was so bland because it's made with quinoa and steamed milk and pears/apples and not much else excitement goes into it. If they put berries in it that would help sweeten it up but they didn't quite nail this creation on the head. Other than that it's a reasonably priced yummy eatery with a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the phoenix area. I wish they had more locations. The low-carb breakfast is like a miracle. You can see for yourself in the pictures that the food is amazing. I wish I lived closer to it"}
{"text":"The d'veggie bowl is one of the most delicious meals I've had in awhile. The staff is really nice, and the drive through moves very quickly. I can really go all day about how great this place was. Go check it out!!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time finding anything wrong with this place.   Dog Friendly? Yes.  Customer Friendly? Absolutely.  Delicious food? You bet your ass.   A little on the pricey side for a drive through(nothing too terrible, but probably around $8 without a drink is a good marker), and the hours could be better.  Chicken Pesto Panini is delicious. Comes on white( or wheat if you ask) with mushrooms and tomatoes. This is my go to dish at d'lish. It's like sex. Sometimes they screw something up, but no worries, it's all good. You are still eating a delicious sandwich.(having sex.)  Also try the humanitarian wrap. Its good. Not a fan of the \"burgers\", but the cali club is a delicious breakfast treat, and so is the recently stumbled upon frittata( chicken sausage n stuff frittata on a hashbrown, on  a piece of wheat toast with chipotle sauce drizzled on top.)"}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. I went through today and got a vegan apricot smoothie and the veggie wrap with raspberry dressing instead of the cucumber. It was so amazing!!!! This is my new favorite place! The food was so fresh and you can just feel how healthy it is!"}
