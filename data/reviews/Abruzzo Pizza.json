{"text":"BEST panzarotti in GTA!! Ive tried to find a better panzo all over this vast nation for years and just can't find any place that competes with Abruzzo Pizza, just make sure you get it fried and get the meat sauce to go with it.
On a negative note the pizza here is not good I have not liked the pizza for years and neither do my 4 kids, they want panzos!
I just don't get how a restaurant can make delicious Panzarotti but terrible pizza. Oh well you can't be good at everything.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great place, always wanted to try it and finally did. We came for pizza but i will have to come back for their pasta, looked pretty good. Not sure about the rest of the menu, but when we ordered some toppings for the pizza it was pretty expensive. Will still give it another try for pasta."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their panzo's, it's soo good.
I love how they have so many choices of toppings.
*having grilled shrimp was a huge plus*
and their service is very good as well.

i would have gave this place 5 stars, but the only down part was that their tiramisu, is not fresh. In fact, the bottom of it was still frozen, which was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna for delivery with extra meatballs on the side, it came quickly. But qualty wise wasnt impressed. Meatballs were gummy and not tasty and the lasagna was full of too much cheese that did not taste very fresh. Frozen lasagna at loblaws is compareable. Was looking for a more authentich home made meal and was left disappointed."}
{"text":"I have read some great reviews for this place. Was it an off night? The sauce is supposed to be amazing. We barely had any on our wheel. The bacon is fatty and barely cooked. Hot peppers were scarce. We were excited to try this place and it ended up tasting like cardboard. 

Will not go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. We did take-out rather than dine-in and there was a steady stream of people picking up food. We ordered the Medium Special Pizza ($21) and the Fried Panzerotto ($7.75). I added bacon ($1.20) to the Panzerotto so it wouldn't be too plain but I left the pizza as-is.

The Panzerotto was huge, definitely shareable. I wish there was a bit more tomato sauce inside but it was still good. The pizza was great with a good amount of toppings. I actually couldn't eat as much of the pizza as I wanted since I had the panzerotto first which really filled me up. I'd say in total it was worth the price.

I know this place is good because I'm already thinking about what to order next time we go :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about. Pizza was really nothing special. The tomato topping is just tiny little diced cubes of tomato, you can barely see them. Prices are very expensive. Service was poor- we were never once asked if we wanted a refill on our water. Took forever to get the cheque. The one positive I can say is that portion sizes here are very generous. Still, won't be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Their pizza is among the best I've ever had. We order the party size deluxe, but sub out bacon for extra cheese. We freeze what we don't finish, and when that's gone, we repeat the process. It's one of the only things I let my daughter eat that isn't organic.

Their wings special is also great - 5lbs for $42! These days, that's a steal in my book. The hot is more like a mild, tho, so a word of warning to those who like extra spicy things: have your own hot sauce ready.

Also, they open at 3:30pm on weekends (I know, right?), so order the night before and reheat in the oven if you're planning a lunch thing. I like it even more reheated."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pizza place.  Me and my brother are always waiting for any excuse to order Abruzzo's.  The dilemma is usually whether we want pizza or panzos.  Decisions decisions!  Can't go wrong either way... the fried panzo is a must try if you've never had one here."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the the york region. Not too thick, not too thin. Just right. 
If you've got a pizza-loving appetite like myself, then I would get a size large and just keep those 2-3 slices for leftovers. Cause trust me, you'll be craving again in no time.

Personal speciality pizza here: mushroom, onion, pepperoni - well done. you're welcome.

OH, and the panzos..... Damn. So good."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been wanting to come back here to get their panzos for a while now. Ever since we first came here over 2 years ago. But they don't open till 3:30pm on the weekends, so it hasn't worked out until now. Was finally around here during dinner time a while back and decided to swing by. They have expanded since the last time I was here. Their dinning area used to be where the take-out area currently is, but they've since expanded next door, and now the dinning area is much brighter, cleaner, spacious and nicely decorated. Prices have also increased a bit, but that's to be expected nowadays I suppose.

Our Order:
2 x Baked Basic Panzerottos - tomato sauce and cheese only ($8) each 
2 x Side order of Meat Sauce for each panzo ($1.5) each
2 x Side order of Meatball ($2) each
A Pasta Carbonara - bacon, sausage, garlic + eggs tossed in olive oil + parmigiano ($15.50)

We were going to order a meatball sandwich, because my friends loves meatballs. But decided we didn't want the extra carbs from the sandwich. We were still interested to see what their meatball tasted like though, so we just ordered 2 side orders of meatball to try. Those came out rather quickly which we were happy about since it was already 9pm-ish at the time, and we were starving. We devoured them quickly which tied us over till the rest if the food came. The meatballs were good, but just standard, nothing really special about them. 

A while later our Panzos and pasta arrived, we couldn't wait to dig into them. The Panzos were just as huge as the last time we came, so it was a good thing we only got 2 to share between the 4 of us. I was actually almost full already from just eating half of one. There is so much cheese inside that when you cut it open, the cheese actually spills out a bit. It was so so so good! I was just in a cheesy, saucy, carb-y heaven. If you don't add any extra toppings to the Panzo like us, definitely get the extra meat sauce to give the Panzo an extra meaty flavour. I honestly never really liked Panzos till I got it here, because all of the ones I've had before were fried. This was the first place I've seen it baked, and it is definitely the way to go for Panzos. For the Carbonara, you get to choose what kind of pasta noodle you wanted, so we chose penne. None of us particularly liked the Carbonara. It was much drier than we were used to and a tad too salty for our liking. It just wasn't what we were expecting for a Carbonara. 

Service was friendly, but slightly slower then we liked. It was kind of hard tracking down our waitress for more water, and for the bill and change at the end of the meal. I'll be back again for the Panzos for sure. Hopefully it doesn't take me another 2 years to come back!"}
{"text":"Best Panzo I've ever had. Not only is it delicious, but one order is enough for dinner and the next day's leftover lunch. Pizza and veal sandwiches are good too."}
{"text":"Great pizza, pasta and panzerottis to die for. Been eating here for many many years..I now drive from brooklin to Richmond hill just to get my fix now and then..worth the drive"}
{"text":"A taste of little Italy where you'd least expect it. I went boring and got a sausage and mushroom pizza, and it exceeded my expectations. 

Sparse atmosphere and service, but still very attentive.

Surroundings are a bit meager (is everything surrounding Toronto in a strip mall?), but there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Last night after a crazy day of running the roads, I tried Abruzzo for the first time. I got two slices of pizza (different ones) and both were great. It was a little slow in coming, (probably because I was starving) but when I got them home it was worth the wait. Still hot, fresh tasting and delicious. Go for it - forget the calories - I ran them off during the day!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to Abruzzo Pizza after seeing all the raving reviews and it did not disappoint! We ordered a small special pizza and Vince's special pasta with fuscilli. The crust on the pizza was perfect but the large amount of toppings made the centre soggy. It was otherwise delicious. The flavour on the pasta was excellent as well, but I have to say it is a tad pricey for the given portion. 

Next time I'll order the pizza with less toppings, and will definitely try the panzo!"}
{"text":"Solid place that has maintained its standards over the years.  The pizza, panzerottis and sandwiches are all delicious.  Delivery takes some time, and there is always a line up for takeout, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is what I have always wanted in a pizza place. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. They deliver and the food always arrives hot. We order from there once a week and have never been disappointed. Personally I feel that their pizza is better than Dante's or Paoletti's. 

The pasta is pretty good too, especially the lasagna."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Need I say more!! Only complaint is they charge more for dining in as opposed to take out for the exact same food. That's just not right. Don't know many places that do that!"}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight. Free parking for customers is always nice. 

There are two entrances, one is for the sit-in dining and one is for takeout. The dining area looks like it was recently remodeled. We decided to get the take-out to try the pizza, but I might dine-in next time.  

At first glance, the menu looks average. There is nothing fancy about the items. This is not Pizzeria Libretto. The lady behind the take-out counter claimed that the special pizza sells the best. However, I was in the mood for Hawaiian so I just order a large pizza with pineapple and ham.

So the verdict is that the large pizza was consumed by 2 people in less than an hour after leaving the restaurant. The pizza is just that good. If you want the basics executed well this is the place to go. 

Only dropping 1 star because I think that the prices are a bit high compared to the USA. It was $20 for a large pizza. Similar pizzas in the USA cost $12-$15."}
{"text":"Order the signature special pizza and panzo for delivery. Food is fresh yummy just the person who pick up phone for taking my order is hardly communicate, be patient!"}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall yet packed all night every night after work"}
{"text":"Abbruzzo's has awesome Panzorotto! It comes standard with cheese and tomato sauce inside and then you can add other things like veggies or meats for a price. If you like it saucayyy make sure you order a side of dipping sauce because there isn't too much sauce inside of the panzo.

I've had both the baked and fried, both are delicious but I prefer the baked panzos because the fried ones are a tad oily for my liking. I have yet to try the pizza so I'll be going back to get some soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fatty for Panzo's, and this place roped me in 20 years ago, all other panzo's aspire to one day grow up and become a Abbruzo panzo, you would think I'd get sick from ordering the same panzo for the last 20 years but my stomach will disagree and I'll keep crushing it until I'm dead.....better yet, I think I'm going to bury my fave panzo with me.

Done and done"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation, dined in, their pizza is good but far from the best Ive had. Didnt think it deserved the hype the recommendation has given me. Still I would probably do their take out next time for their panzerotti.
Will review the take out experience in future :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time at Abruzzo. Ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings and a pound of medium wings (total $37). Location was busy with quite a bit of people waiting for pick up and they had a separate section for delivery drivers who were all also waiting.... Pizza crust was the best part for me, light and crispy but still soft inside. The pizza itself was a little undercooked in the centre and the Italian sausage was too salty for my liking. Wings are a good size and sauce was decent. Overall good for a lazy sweat pants pizza night but would not go out of my way to get more."}
{"text":"Amazing and will always be my go-to for pizza, sandwiches, and pasta. I usually take-out however the dining section is very nice."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and Cesar salad from here for the first time because of the reviews. I was so disappointed. The salad was so soggy and not fresh at all I ended up throwing it in the garbage . The pizza, even though I ordered double bacon had hardly any toppings on it at all. I was so disappointed after spending $36 to end up having it go in the garbage. I have never written a review before but felt this deserved one after reading all the great reviews. What a waste on hard earned money. 

MG,  Thornhill"}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times and the pizza is decent but marcellos is better"}
{"text":"Their Take-Out is amazing one of the best pizza in town, However I wish I could say the same about their newly expanded and renovated dining area. Went last night for the first time since its opening; which has now been many months, enough months that most places have worked out the serving and kitchen bumps. We arrive to the usual full house and were pleasantly surprised when the hostess says the wait time for a table for 2 is 15 mins. So we wait outside with the large group of people also waiting for a table - the waiting area insides fits 4 people at best. 15mins later we re-enter past the mob of people in the waiting area and approach the hostess to tell her we will wait at the bar. After ordering a couple of beers we see the wait staff clear both of the only 2 tops in the place and figure great we will be seated soon. Well 15 more minutes go by while the prep and seat larger groups that got there well after us. Finally after another 10 mins we get seated, menus presented by the hostess and then nothing....nothing for 20 mins. what we think is our server approaches the table behind us (a table of 6) and greets them, then cleans the table next to ours. Comes back 10 mins later and takes their order and proceeds to the servers area to place the order, then walks into the kitchen. 10 mins later returns with the drinks for the table behind us and walks away. At this point since no one has approached us I get the attention of the hostess, tell her we haven't been approached by anyone and if she could send over a server. Well I doubt she did it because after another 10 mins of seating there unattended we approach the bar tender and ask to pay for our drinks, while explaining the reason why we are leaving, He apologizes but left the bar to go back into the kitchen...you would think he would cash us out immediately...finally I throw $15 on the bar and leave - don't know if that covered the 2 beers but didn't care at the time. Its a shame ... we observed other dinners with the same frustration waiting for service...this is what happens when you hire kids to serve."}
{"text":"Got take out pizza and it was delicious!!! This will be my new go-to pizza place. It was soft and thin which was great. The take out process was also very quick and efficient which I liked. The restaurant had a separate entrance for take-out and the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"This pizza is nothing special. Its actually not good at all. I decided to give it a try since the reviews were pretty good, but my experience was anything but. They are very busy and I guess a lot of people like them, but I find their pizza nothing to boast about. The cheese was bland, not enough sauce and the toppings were minimal and it was expensive. Not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"After one of the scariest rides of my life, slipping and sliding on a snowy Toronto evening, I finally made it to Abruzzo Pizza.  What surprised me was how packed the place was even though it was snowing outside and close to 10 pm at night.

The decor is very simple, so nothing to show off to for a date.  The food, however, was quite delicious.  Service was prompt and friendly, by mostly tough looking men you would find on the Sopranos.

We ordered the Special Pizza, the Greek Salad, and the Special Pasta with Sausage.  All the dishes were quite good, and my date, who usually would not like pizza, actually complimented the place.

It was definitely better than the chain pizza joints around here, but not quite as good as New York or European pizza (especially Italy).  I would say, it is on par with some of the better pizza places in California.

Everything tasted really fresh, and the pizza has a nice crisp to the crust.  The pasta, a little on the spicy side, was also well prepared and had authentic Italian sausage in them (what a nice surprise!).  I would definitely come back to this place if I ever had a craving for pizza again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!   Family owned, with over 35 years of knowing and serving their clients!!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Rubbery crust you can barely bite into without hurting your jaw. I ordered because of the reviews but wow I'm disappointed people really don't know what good pizza is. Paid for toppings and they were so scarce it was a rip off. Never again."}
{"text":"The only place that will satisfy my Panzerotto craving, and the portions are huge! The meat sauce is a must! Great service, great food. The décor is not that pleasing to the eye but as long as it's clean who cares when you've got a Giant Panzerotto staring at you, waiting for you to dig into its deliciousness!

Update: This is STILL my favorite Panzerotto place. I went back several times since my last entry because I crave it all the time!! The service is also very consistent and their other dishes (including their Sandwiches) are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about. Tried the special pizza and the panzo. Admittedly the extra sauce was really delicious; I had the tomato sauce (no meat). But, it would be delicious with just bread. The pizza dough is too powdery and the panzo was rubbery."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time. But they have raised the prices again and now this place is too expensive for my budget which is too bad because the food is good. Now I only go here occasionally but if you don't mind paying the high prices, the food is very good!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Thornhill and once a month I'd order a Pizza or a Panzerotto (spelling) and just be in Pizza heaven.  Really this is some of the best Pizza you could get in the GTA.   I highly recommand ordering from them or dropping in."}
{"text":"Abruzzo Pizza has been around for as long as I remember

a popular choice in the area. I see the delivery car around town all the time. 

my review is based on the panzorotto/panzorotti/calzone, if you don't what it is. it's a probably the best food invention of the 19th century

it's essentially a stuffed pizza pocket folded in half stuffed with mozzarella cheese and ingredients you'd top a pizza. it's and fried or baked. ( fried tastes a lot better btw) 

it's a meal you'd eat with a fork and knife. the Abruzzo tomato sauce is exceptional and is made from crushed field tomatoes. I'd recommend having it on the side for dipping.  one of the best panzos i've had."}
{"text":"Had Abruzzo's for the first time a couple of weeks ago. We ordered a thin crust whole wheat pizza with 3 toppings... it smelled amazing! when we opened up the box, it looked great. Only drawback was due to the thin crust, the pizza kept on falling apart when we tried to grab a slice. Next time, we'll get regular crust, and maybe it'll be easier to eat. I gave four stars because they shouldve cooked it a bit longer to help the crust crisp up so the toppings wouldnt fall off, and because it was a tad bit expensive ($20+ for a large, 3 topping pizza). None the less, we love Abruzzos"}
{"text":"I hear Abruzzo has been around since the beginning of time, yet I only got to try it for a late lunch last Friday afternoon. I went with a former Torontonian now living in LA who once vowed that Dante's was the best. I actually don't agree with that and it seems neither does the majority of Yelpers. 

I expected an old-school pizzeria with no frills, and that's pretty much what Abruzzo's is. It's a low-key kinda place with excellent pizzeria/trattoria fare at semi-decent prices. It's not that the food is expensive but for an $11 lasagne, a small salad or some bread (I'm not talking about a bread basket--it's just not that kind of place) would have been nice. 

We were there around 5-ish, which made for a very late lunch, but nevertheless, it was almost a full house in both dining areas. As I had a dinner to attend later that evening, I tried to resist pigging out and we ordered the baked panzerotto with mushrooms, sausage, and black olives (which were missing), along with a meat lasagne, washing it all down with our aranciata sodas. Both items were really good and filling. If the baked panzerotto was that tasty, I can only  imagine what the deep fried one would have been like! The lasagne was of the typical, homemade variety--no complaints there.

I ordered a mushroom & pepperoni panerotto (again, baked) to go just because it was so tasty and noticed that the one consistency is that they are quite scantily clad. There is not a lot of filling in them so it's mostly bread (but damn good bread!). When I was ordering the take-out panzo, I mentioned that they forgot our black olives and they offered not to charge us for any toppings which was not necessary, but sweet. Thing is, they did charge us for them! I didn't see a reason to complain about it since I did order the stuff, so why not pay for it, right??

The only reason this place doesn't get the full five is that they're too skimpy with the panzo fillings. I don't know if it's the same with their pizzas, but judging from the photos and real-life pizzas that other diners were having that day, it didn't look like it. The place is kind of out of the way (for me), though it's not their fault and no, that is not a reason to deduct points. (I figured I'd just throw that in there while the momentum of whining was still going.)

If you're looking for Terroni, Libretto, or any of these Neapolitan pizzerias, this isn't it. But if you enjoy a homey, filling, and simply tasty meal, check out Abruzzo as I am sure you will like it. They also deliver (to where, I'm not sure), and this is obviously a popular service as they have quite a few delivery cars that were constantly coming and going the whole time!"}
{"text":"You're expected to pay more for a pizza that will knock you off your feet. I order whole wheat even knowing as a health gimp, whole wheat pizza really diminishes the quality of a pizza but this was my best surprise since I got back from Naples in Italy. The best pizzas have the right marriage of the crust and sauce/cheese and Abruzzo did not fail to deliver. 
Don't judge a book by its cover. This establishment has been around for a long time with good reason. The 70s wall panels are covered with nostalgic picture frames and hick adorned woodshop feelings. It's not a place to stay and eat, but you're looking at a true Italian family run business."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the long time customers of Abruzzo who wrote their reviews here.. I myself have been a loyal customer for the past 7-8 years.. but today's experience has really let me down.

First is the price increase. If the quality of the food is better or at least maintained, I wouldn't mind a small price increase, but now I have to pay a RIDICULOUS price increase of $6 more for the EXACT same pizza I had a couple of months ago?? Seriously???!!?! I would understand a MODEST increase, but come on.. $6 is way too much!! 

To add insult to the injury, the pizza quality has gone DOWN. And I mean waaaaaaay down!! Their pizza used to be very cheesy and chewy, and just overall tasted different from the other pizza joints that I did not mind paying a bit more money compared to the other places. But now, it is a totally different story!! The pizza tasted bare and the dough was so hard to chew.. A hefty increase in price but decrease in quality :(((((((((((((((((

I am assuming their restaurant expansion has led the business to increase their price continuously and just cannot keep up with the quality control.. When I went to pick up my pizza, I saw that the restaurant wasn't that busy either on a weekend dinner time.. 

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Always tastes great. Expensive but worth it. Wish they had a computer system to remember people's previous orders."}
{"text":"We ordered food on two separate bills. They said an hour delivery, and he came 40 minutes late. When the delivery guy arrived he had charged us for delivery two times (once on each bill), and changed the prices on our bill, writing a different number on top of what we were quoted over the phone. Hope you enjoyed that, it was the last money I'll ever give your business."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. The front lady in the pickup area is so sweet and so kind! Great service and pizza!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best pizza place in north of toronto. I have been here on many occassions and every time i have gotten a super tasty pizza. Price is reasonable and lots of customization or the pizzas is available (which is great if you a picky eater). Their Panzerotti is also famous and tasty, but definitely start your experience with a pizza."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 16 years, it's remarkable to me how they have been able to keep the quality excellent for that long. I always get the Panzo and have to say there isn't anything like it in the city! Best Panzo of all time!"}
{"text":"Came into Abruzzo Pizza for a slice on a Monday afternoon. The place took up almost an entire plaza! They had a room for their drivers to hang out, another room for take-out and pick-up's, then the actual restaurant itself. I got the impression these guys were slingin' some serious pies.

To the take-out room I went, and ordered a pepperoni slice ($4.00). It is my personal indicator of how good a pizzeria is. The slice came piping hot out of the oven, cut into 2 fairly large slices. The pepperoni are the large round types versus the small ones that shrivel up in the oven. The pizza sauce could have had more depth to it, however the cheese was very good. Tasted like fresh mozzarella, and was all stringy (like bubble-gum lol).

I will return to Abruzzo Pizza the next time I am in Richmond Hill to try their famed panzerotti's!"}
{"text":"My favourite panzzerotti place hands down. It's a bit in the pricy side especially when they charge you per topping and they also charge for sauce. Dinning in I find service sometimes slow. They're busy but not enough guys working. Take out is easier or faster but they charge $10 for a large tomato sauce which is the same price as the panzzerotti almost.. They need to widen their delivery spectrum to Markham !"}
{"text":"Pizza here was just ok. Seen other people's reviews + photos and thought it would be amazing, but the dough was so powdery and there wasn't enough tomato sauce for the base so it was sort of dry."}
{"text":"Must Try: Special Pizza, Chicken Wings, Panzerotto

Rating: (9/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  
By far, my favourite pizza spot in the GTA. I typically get the Special Pizza, and sub out the onions and green peppers for other toppings (yes, you can do that). The crust is neither too thick nor too thin, but the sauce is layered with a ton of toppings and some top notch cheese. Thanks to the great amount of toppings, every bite is filled with flavour. Abruzzo shines in their ability to give a good amount of toppings. 

The chicken wings are my next favourite thing. Great size, fried perfectly and the right sauce. Matches up perfectly with the pizza.

The pasta dishes are good, but nothing too special. Personally I come for the pizza and wings, and do without the pasta dishes. 

Service is friendly and take out is quick. Best pizza in GTA hands down."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with great Italian food, both eat in or take out. I normally get pizza to go, the crust is flavourful, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They also have great greek salad and if you feel for more cold cuts, the Abruzzo salad is topped with salami and other deli meats.

Came on Thanksgiving monday night with a group of 6 and the food didn't disappoint.

Ordered a large greek salad, large pizza (12 slices), carbonara and veal parm. The veal parm was a pleasant surprise, very cheesy and the choice of the side pasta had flavourful meat sauce. We shared the dish but can easily finish the whole dish on my own. 

Didn't have a chance to try their desserts, I will definitely come back to try more of their items.

Note: small plaza, limited parking"}
{"text":"Been an Abruzzo's customer for 18 years! This place is fantastic. It has only gotten better over the years. In recent years, they expanded their hole-in-the-wall type location and added a dining area next door. They've also extended their hours to meet that lunch demand.

The first thing you must try when you go to Abruzzo's is their Panzerotto. Fill it with a couple of ingredients. I prefer to have it fried, but I heard baked is just as awesome. Also, add on a meat sauce....mmmmmmm.

They also have amazing pastas and veal sandwich is nice and tender served on a huge panini. Is your mouth watering yet? Mine is.

Abruzzo's has a great delivery service as well, so take advantage of that if you're at work and are looking for a pizza/Italian food fix!

If you go into the restaurant, they sometimes have menus that have coupons inside them. It's a bit of a rarity to find, but hold onto that flyer when you get it. You'll be using it later ;)

What more can I say? It's a Richmond Hill gem."}
{"text":"Tried the abruzzo special pizza, ordered additional italian sausage... got charged for it.. when I got home it wasn't there. I guess its my fault that I didn't check...  but ill let that screw up slide and give a fair review.

 If people are giving 4 and 5 stars to this place it has to be for something other than the special pizza and the carbonara because, although they were good, they were definitely nothing special, especially for the prices they charge which are slightly higher than a lof of the pizza places in the GTA. The crust and sauce weren't amazing, the toppings were exactly what was on the menu,It's not like they used fresh mozzarella like the real expensive restaurants. So other than that, not sure why it would be way better than any other pizza. 

People are going for a lot of hyperboles in their reviews so here's one. Its the best pizza along Yonge between steeles and major mac."}
{"text":"Their take out pizza is very good but their expanded restaurant is not that great.  Always busy and it seems that the hosts are too busy to really care about all their customers.  Overall, I will definitely do the take out  but do not recommend the dine in."}
{"text":"Im loving the pizza and casual atmosphere. 

It's nice and clean inside. Good seating, very open, good lighting and a modern feel. Service is very attentive and no waiting for drink refills or to order. Ive been back lots. Its just great and food tastes awesome. Presentation of the plate is clean."}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed that this review is kind of short for me buuut, I don't have much to say. I'm saddened that this is my first poor review. Yes, there comes a time in all \"yelpers\" lives when they have to bite the bullet ...

Well its my time...

So I finally jumped on the Yelp bandwagon and decided to try out Abruzzo's. I've heard about the panzorotti and was feeling naughty (for lack of a better word) and myself and a friend wanted pizza, not just any pizza...like good non-cardboard pizza. 

We ordered 2 panzorotti's with different fillings to share. I landed on pepperoni, red onion, diced tomato and mushrooms. He decided on bacon, black olives, mushrooms and green peppers. Okay, I have to admit...his was better.  And to be less \"naughty\" we decided to order them baked. Next time I will go with my gut and order fried. 

What can I say? I'm a bad girl.

The delivery took quite a while, almost an hour and when they came they were cold. Since we were both starved we ate some and put the rest in the oven to heat up before our second helping. 

The size was impressive ( that's what she said)... size does matter when feeding a hungry dude.  We did find the crust dry and the side sauces were nothing special. Actually the meat one reminded me of Chef Boyardee.  But hey, along with a couple beers any pizza can be edible. 

Since I still have hope that this was a one off,  I will trust my fellow \"yelpers\" and try Abruzzo's again.  

Next time I will order it fried, with plain marinara sauce and with my friends choice toppings. Darn I hate being wrong. But he was nice enough to share :) . 

Cheers,

{"text":"Good Chet's salad, although the calamari was a mix bagged... Rubbery and had the feeling it wasn't all octopus but the seasoning was ok. 

I was brought to check out what is a busy place, just wished I was comfy the product. Although the cappucino was very good!

Maybe next time I will be more comfy with this when I come back from Florida."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I've ever had. Went in for a slice today, last time i had a piece of pizza from abruzzo was like 2011. I eat dominoes, pizzapizza, pizza hut, pizza nova, and pizzaville . . but this is literally the best slice Ive ever had my goodness. For $4 you get a nice slice in a small box. Very good presentation but who cares. The pizza, oh my . . thin crust, just the right amount of sauce, very tasty, lots of fresh mozzarella, and the pepperoni?? Wow. I havent ever had pepperoni quite like this. When i get pizza elsewhere i always get a garlic dip. But i could eat this without it and that says a lot. I dont live in richmond hill anymore, but whenever i do go down i have to remember to come here. Thank you."}
{"text":"We do take out from Abruzzo's about twice a month. Pizza is the best in Richmond Hill. Even better is the panzorotti which you can have baked or fried, (sorry, mine is always fried!). The lasagne is also very yummy and a good sized portion. Can't go wrong here.

{"text":"This past weekend I returned to Abruzzos on a mission from the pizza gods. I was hungry and had brought a friend who was bold enough to Blaspheme that there was no way Abruzzo's could be as good or better than her local Pizza joint. 

Challenge Accepted!

We arrived during the busy dinner hour on Friday and waited only a couple of minutes for a seat! Once seated we both agreed that my previous review of their Panzorotti would be the litmus test which would determine her scoring of this venue.

To begin we ordered a small Caesar salad to share (it was large for 2 people, and there was some left over at the end of the meal). However, here is what we decided to order in each of our Panzo's.

Her: 
A purist at heart my friend decided she wanted to KISS (keep it simple stupid), and ordered a basic Cheese and Sauce with mushrooms.

Me:
The seasoned veteran, knowing exactly what I wanted and went for it. Onions, Green Peppers, Hot Soprasatta (like salami but WAY better), Goat Cheese, and Mushrooms.

To share:
Bowl of their legendary marinara SAWSE 

The Verdict:
Before digging in a sat back and watched my friend analyze the beast in front of her. Cutting into it and taking her first bite I watched as ray of light spread across her face, the corners of her mouth turned up in a smile and her eyes rolled up in the back of her head. One look from her was all it took. She immediately admitted defeat through full mouth and went back to the task at hand. 
 
From my end, years of panzo consumption have helped me hone my topping preference and once again I was elated with the result Panzo Perfection.

{"text":"I've heard too many good things over the years, which continued to flow in even after their renovation to include an upgraded dine-in area. I remember them back when they were the pizza shop providing to Red Maple Public School around the corner for pizza days, and parents were happy to know their toppings were fresh, they used real cheese, and their dough was allergy-friendly/flexible.

I finally got the chance to dine in last night. Note that no reservations are taken, so get ready for a wait if you don't arrive early, or plan for late dinner (8pm would be safe). A table for four took 30-40min wait time, and some patrons don't understand the need to not take forever with their drinks (and it was only soda at that!) after their food has already been packed away to take home, and their bill paid.

We ordered a large basic thick-crust with pepperoni, salami, and zucchini, a small thick-crust veggie, calamari, bruschetta, and a pound of honey garlic wings. The large pizza is comparable to an extra-large elsewhere while the small is comparable to a medium, and the toppings were generous. The thick crust is soft but not soggy on the bottom, and holds up well if you want to pick up your slice to eat. The veggie toppings were generous and actually looked like their original form, as opposed to some shriveled pre-sautéed version that's lost its vibrant colour. The meats were thicker cut meaning they didn't turn into pseudo-bacon crisps - and they were laid generously all over the pizza as well. Finally the cheese - a highlight of Abruzzo pizza - thick layer and cheesy, and not abnormally stringy like some other commercialized chains (cheese isn't always supposed to be like that, and I find the very stringy kind to be only second choice on my pizzas).

I recommend the bruschetta for the fresh tomatoes topping the equally tasty bread, but I would say pass to the calamari next time. Nothing terrible about it, but nothing made it stand out so I'd save the experience for other restaurants. The wings are a standard pizza accompaniment, however I found them to be tough meat - as if they'd been in the oven for too long. Again - skip the wings if you can.

Overall great place for pizza - if you live close by and have a gathering planned, take out is the excellent solution to good pizza and less wait time!"}
{"text":"Established in 1981 by two brothers from Italy, Abruzzo's has been a Richmond Hill staple for as long as I can remember. In addition to delicious Pizza and Panzerotti's, they also offer pastas and Italian sandwiches, but I can only vouch for the pizza and panzos. The pizza is solid and the party size pizzas are great for groups or events. They boast a wide range of fresh toppings inclduing some you would not find at any ordinary pizzeria. The panzos are delish squared, for the record I have never ordered a baked one from them because the fried ones are too good to be true. I also recommend getting a side of meat or plain tomato sauce to accompany your panzo's crispy edges.

See below the selection of toppings available to you should you decide to order from Abruzzos.  

Anchovies, Artichokes, Bacon, Black Forest Ham, Black Olives, Broccoli, Capers, Capicollo, Diced Tomato, *Double Cheese, Italian Sausage, Extra Cheese, *Feta Cheese, Fresh Hot Peppers, Fresh Mushrooms, Grilled Egg Plant, *Goat Cheese, Green Olives, Green Pepper, *Grilled Chicken, Grilled Zucchini, Ground Beef, Hot Peppers, Onions, Pepperoni, Pineapple, *Potatoes, Plum Tomato, Red Onions, Roasted Red Pepper, Salami, *Shrimps, Spinach, Sun Dried Tomato.

{"text":"Why should my Italian wife cook when you have this place around. Always go for the panzerotto and the size is huge. Pizza is the best in the GTA.  Sauce is homemade and all ingredients used are fresh."}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself in Richmond Hill, I make sure it's sometime around Meal Time, so I have an excuse to hit up Abruzzo for a panzerotti.

Deep-fried, just pepperoni cheese and sauce inside, and it's truly just perfection.

The sauce on the side is unnecessary, but delicious, and the inside is stuffed with sauce and pepperoni and a ton of cheese, with the delicious crisp fried outer shell it's just absolutely perfect.

Trust me, just go, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for over a decade. The best pizza in the area. Such a good selection of ingredients. The panzerotti are amazing. Always get it fried, the calories don't matter here!! The veal sandwiches are fantastic. 

Good quality food that hasn't changed after all these years. Love the new dine-in section too. Great addition."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years and I have never dined-in. Almost always delivery or pick up. Baked Panzerotti or pizza is the way to go. The pasta's aren't bad either. Over the years, I've had a few pizza's with chewy/tuff dough.  The pizza's aren't cheap and you would expect the quality to be the same every time. Despite that I still keep coming back, hoping that i'm not unlucky."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good pizza place. I came on a Friday night for dinner. The wait wasn't so bad (15 minutes) as there was only the two of us. The restaurant is a bit small so if you are planning on coming with a large group it would be best to make reservations. 

I had the Caesar salad which was just ok and the fried panzerroto with mushrooms and green olives with a side of meat sauce. The panzo was a decent size and really delicious. My hubby got a pizza with anchovies, tomato and basil. It was pretty good but the panzo was definitely better.

I probably won't be back for dine in but would consider getting takeout. The parking lot is small and it was a bit of a pain trying to find a spot. I'm still on the search for a holy grail pizza joint."}
{"text":"Thank God for Yelp. If it wasn't this website I wouldn't had the best pizza of my two first months in Toronto. The sad thing is that this place is very far from home, actually I was looking for somewhere not close because I have a car for the weekend - so, I will not be able to visit Abruzzo in a regular basis. Too bad, because their food is awesome and the price is great.

We went there today, a Friday, at 9 pm. They have something like 10 tables for dining in. The place was full and there was 2 other couples in front of us, I believe. We had to wait half an hour to get a table. However, their staff seemed to be very concerned about us waiting, the guy from the cashier was checking on the availability all the time. I was starting to get frustrated when they called my name, thinking that maybe the place wasn't a good idea...

We ordered the garlic bread with cheese. Wonderful. Soft bun, delicious cheese, and of course, as an authentic Paulista (native from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo), I had to try everything with olive oil, and theirs was terrific, seasoned with herbs. My wife says that it's the best garlic bread she ever had, and I don't disagree. That alone made us forget completely about the wait.

Then, the pizza. We ordered the \"Abruzzo Special\" pizza (it's one of the few for which they have pre-defined toppings). It's a little bit different than the other pizzas that I had here; it reminded me the pizzas that I used to have in Brazil, with small crust and toppings very well diced. But what amazed me was the overall quality of the outcome. As soon as I put the first piece in my mouth, it sent shivers down my spine of how good it was. Truly amazing.

The place itself, as the others noted, has no frills. I like frills, most of the time; however, I don't know why, I was feeling very comfortable there. The servers, while not very warm (probably because of how many people they were serving), were very diligent.

If you like pizza, don't miss this place. You've got to taste that and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Everyone in my family loves Abruzzo's!  Looks like we'll be regulars.  Pizza and calzones!  Nom, nom, nom.  Thanks, guys!"}

{"text":"Bad service but really good food pretty much sums it up. Rude waitress and inattentive servers. Seemed like they were in a hurry to hand us the bill. I would order for takeout next time so I won't face another rude waitress as their food is bomb!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Abruzzo, so it's quite obvious that I'm a fan!  I have never eaten in their dining room, only had take out on several, several occasions.  

Abruzzo's is a great pizza spot- you can get your pizza fix, with a little extra on the side.  I particularly enjoy their vegetarian pizza (with mushrooms and olives), and their Greek salad.  I would have to say their Greek salad is by far the best in the city, and for a great value.  $10 will get you a large take-out size of Greek salad, good enough for 2 people.  I usually have the Greek salad accompany my pizza.

As for the pizza-- It is good.  It's not THE BEST pizza I've had, but it's tasty and hits the spot.  Make sure to ask for your pizza to be cooked WELL DONE, as I found it was rather raw otherwise.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their prices... A medium pizza could easy go for over $20 with 3 toppings... which is a lot of money in my opinion.

I would pass on their veal sandwiches... Not enough sauce, and the bread isn't crusty enough (too soft and doughy for a veal sandwich).

Abruzzo's is quick with their pick-up orders... A call ahead of time, and my order is generally ready in 20 minutes.  The place is always packed-- weekends or weekdays, and is open really late on weekends (3am, maybe 4?)"}
{"text":"If you're still eating at Pizza Pizza, you obviously haven't been here. You know the saying you get what you pay for? Abruzzo Pizza is the definition of that. Everything tastes real, homemade, fresh, and ridiculously delicious. I always get thin crust with mushrooms cheese, tomatoes and olives, and a special salad (which is basically cheese, peppers, olives, and a bunch of cold cut meats) It's to die for. Best pizza in the world, and I've been around to quite a few places, NOTHING beats it."}

{"text":"The Abruzzo Salad will forever be one of my favourite salads, that I will continue telling everyone about. 
I LOVE my food, and I like my food to not be simple & bland.. Ive always wished some place would have a salad on the menu that I would actually genuinely enjoy, & then I was introduced to an Abruzzo Salad by one of my co workers. 
Its filled with EVERYTHING. From Cold Cuts , to MUSHROOMS (my favourite) , olives, tomato, onions, carrot, green pepper, and Mozzarella !! With simply delicious olive oil dressing to perfect everything, It is very oily, but I love it like that.  I Add chicken to it, and is perfect. 

Portioning is amazing. The Small salad is too much for me, so nevermind the large salad. Very Filling. 

They are very accommodating, on multiple occasions when I was starving they delivered to my work for just one sa

Ive also tried the Gnocchi here, with Rose Sauce, Also fantastic. 
love this place,"}
{"text":"We wanted to try some pizza other than the franchise ones. We dined in instead of takeout.

Special pizza - crust was not too thick and not too thin. Super cheesy and good amount of toppings. Not really sure if it's that special to be $18 for a small. 

Fried panzerotto with pepperoni and a side of tomato sauce. Tomato sauce on the side is $1.50. Panzerotto was huge! Loaded with cheese and meat. I enjoyed the sauce on the side but my boyfriend said the panzerotto was yummy enough without the sauce. 

Service was OK, kind of slow. The dine-in area is on the smaller side. Large windows made the area seems larger. Definitely coming back for their foods but do take-out instead. Prices were different when we dined-in than take out."}

Food came.  A bit cold a bit soggy.  Oh well.  There's lots of other aces to eat I suppose."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. You are unlikely to find more authentic Italian fare north of Toronto. Sometimes, there's a bit of a wait to get a table, but that wait is absolutely worth it! Try the calzone!"}
{"text":"Bad beginning, good ending. Server took forever to acknowledge us, but service was fine for the rest of the evening. Pizza was not that special but their panzorotti was delish! Chicken parmesan dinner was well portioned and tasted good. Nothing fancy or unique but overall decent neighbourhood joint."}
{"text":"The BEST panzerotti ever! Abruzzo offers two types: baked and fried. I tried both and the fried version is the best. My favourite is with cheese, mushroom and pepperoni with the meat sauce on the side for dipping. But be warned, the panzerotti is huge so it's great for sharing unless you are really hungry!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for 20+ yrs and didn't realize I had never written a review for these guys yet. All I can do is a kissing motion with my fingers to my lips. Great, great pizza here (for delivery or dine-in). I would recommend you dine-in if you want pasta. The calzones. OMG, best calzones in the GTA. Make sure you dine-in and eat these babies as soon as they pop out the oven lol (don't be a rookie and order them for take-out). The two owners are some of the nicest, friendliest people. They've been around forever. Back in the 90's the storefront looked run down. At present, it's still a quaint shop on the side of yonge (and very little parking I might add) but the storefront has been renovated. One improvement I think could be implemented is to put more meat into the pastas. Sometimes I order pasta and there's not enough meat running through it. Other times it's jam packed with meat and awesome. I like the fact that the pasta is glazed well with sauce. I've ordered pasta at other joints and there was like no sauce on the noodles. Anyways, a bit more consistency on the amount of meat would go a long way haha. But nevertheless, this place beats all your run-of-the-mill chains.

Pro tip: if you order pizza and you like meat, make sure to have sausage as one of your toppings. It's absolutely delizioso. Really nice flavor and kick at the end of the bite.

Mangia Mangia folks!"}
{"text":"Every time I look for \"nearby restaurants\" on Yelp I get Abruzzo at the top. It's an iconic pizza place in Richmond Hill.

I usually come here for a pepperoni slice to go. $4. Slices are huge (picture below). Love the crust. Toppings are tasty. Great friendly service.

Abruzzo delivers. Both literally and figuratively. Check it out if you are in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This place has been around since time began.  It hasn't changed since.  I'm not big on their pasta, but the pizza is consistently good.  But what they do well is their deep fired panzerotti.  Huge and cheap.  Oh ya, make sure you order a side of meat sauce to dip the crust pieces of the panzerotti!"}
{"text":"Football Sundays and pizzas come hand in hand. Even while on vacation I still wanted to enjoy my football Sundays. I am told that Abruzzo has the best pizza in the area. 

Basic Pizza consists of sauce and cheese: 
- 11' Small: $9.50 CAD + $1.30/topping 
- 13' Medium: $13.50 CAD + $1.75/topping 
- 15' Large: $15.75 CAD + $2/topping 
- 15' x 21' Party Size: $21 CAD + $2.75/topping 

I think we got the most epic pizza for my first game day in Canada. My friend ordered a medium thin whole wheat pizza with chicken, shrimp, zucchini, mushroom, olives and hot peppers ($30 CAD) and I ordered a Garlic Bread w Cheese ($3.50 CAD).

The pizza was delicious. Okay our order was so healthy I want to say it was more like a guilt free flat bread in pizza shape... but nevertheless it was amazing. On the other hand I felt a bit estranged with the garlic bread since it was in a bread roll with not much garlic or cheese.. and it was a bit dry. It was just not what I'm used to... and I actually worked at a pizza place in my teenage years so I might just be particular. 

So if you are in this area looking for a pizza place, this place is a solid option. Great for game day! Your purchase will come with a menu with coupons for your future visits."}
{"text":"Unfortunately no fault of their own Abruzzo has fallen behind in the Pizza Wars.
Reason- the pizza crust/dough.. not enough consistency. Especially with delivery, from time to time it has a stale taste.. Nonna's still has best pie north of 407."}
{"text":"Pizza night was incredibly satisfying because of Abruzzo. The price was easy on the wallet as four people were fed to the max at $50ish plus tax, tip. What we had were as follows: the large house special pizza, pepperoni panzerotti with an added anchovies ingredient, meat lasagna, and a diet Coke. 

The service was fast and attentive. We changed our minds with our order a couple of times but never felt that our server minded. I would have minded, but he did not, hence, we love Abruzzo even more. 

Even though I was quite sick at the time, I was able to taste our wonderful meal. So, yes, kudos again. I doubted my taste buds since I was sick, but our companions always agreed that they enjoyed pizza night here. We were able to talk, eat, watch some TV, and enjoy every bit of cheesy dishes."}
{"text":"A Richmond Hill institution! 

If you've ever lived in Richmond Hill then you have likely visited Abruzzo Pizza on a few occasions (if you haven't well just hang your head in shame!). This place is a local landmark that should have any pizza chain trembling in fear. 

I recently decided to go back to Abruzzo for the first time in a while (I now live in Scarborough) and this place is just as good as I remember. A slice of vegetarian pizza ($3.50) was very good; thin and crispy crust with a copious amount of cheese and lots of veggies made for a great lunch. This place also makes great veal and chicken parm sandwiches, they are quite large and topped with your choice of veggies (be sure to add the hot peppers which pack quite the punch), at around $7.00 you can not beat that value, pair it with a brio and you are in Italian heaven! 

This is mostly a take out place but there is a small seating area. At lunch it is steady but can get quite busy in the evening. In the evening it's always nice to see their fleet of drivers playing cards and chatting, it gives the place a homey feel. The restaurant itself is modest, and quite frankly looks like a place Tony Soprano would hang out. This place is certainly a breath of fresh air from the chains that litter suburbia."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best delivery pizza in the area.  We have never dined in, but we order delivery almost every Friday.  The wait can be long (up to 90 mins) when the weather is bad, but we always order early on days like that.

Panzos - baked or fried they are both awesome! If it wasn't a calorie bomb, I could live on fried panzos.   Make sure to order tomato sauce for dipping.

Pizza - usually awesome, a couple times we have ordered, the dough seemed to be a bit off, flat and maybe a little underdone? Sometimes it arrives lukewarm.  But mostly it is perfection, melty cheese, perfect crust, just the right amount of toppings.  We love the Abruzzo special, which is the perfect ratio of meat: veggies: cheese.

We will keep going back every week for more"}
{"text":"Still king of all Italian Pizza joints in Richmond Hill!

My staple order here these days is a special pizza and spaghetti with tomato sauce, both are very satisfying."}
{"text":"One of my fav pizza places in York Region! The quality of their food is consistent every single time. It's amazing. 

Usually I always order my pizzas with extra sauce as most places don't put enough and I always ask for it to be well done (I just think it's so much better! Try it next time). But at Abruzzo's, their pizzas are sauced and baked just perfect to my liking. 

I just wish they weren't so busy but it's a good thing! I've ordered delivery a couple times and it usually takes 1.5hrs but a lazy pizza craving person can always wait :) oh also, if you have a party coming up and want to advise them of your order ahead of time, they are really great at ensuring you will get your party pizzas on the accurate date & time!"}
{"text":"I was positively diagnosed with celiac disease, but I'm not missing out on pizza.  Abruzzo Pizza is my go to for their gluten free pizza. Thank goodness it's delicious and not just sauce and cheese on a cracker like other pizza places. My family gets the regular pizza that they love, and I get my favourite gf pizza. 
We always get it as takeout or delivery. I can't comment on an eat in experience I didn't have. 
We live in Maple, which is down the road from Woodbridge, pizza mecca.
They know pizza, but unfortunately for me, not gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Came here at 5:30PM on a Tuesday and the place was not so busy, based on the customer line-up.

Ordered a slice of cheese pizza for $4.

Had to wait half an hour for a slice of pizza???? Not cool. The place wasn't even that busy when it comes to walk-in customers.

However, their phone did not stop ringing and they were getting flooded with calls! The staff just basically ignored the phone so I had to deal with hearing that loud ringing while waiting for a slice of pizza.

When the food finally came, thankfully the pizza was fresh. I am not so happy about how thick the crust was though..

I usually don't finish the crust, but this time (or maybe I was just so hungy), the crust tasted so good. Better than most chain pizza places.

I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. First experience here was unremarkable. Servings are huge though.

{"text":"We ordered a thin crust pizza, along with one of their salads (the one with salami inside) and we were thoroughly disappointed with what we ate. The group I was with said that this isn't how it usually is from here, and perhaps it was that we ordered thin crust, but I'm reluctant to try this place again. Delivery guy was friendly!"}
{"text":"My rating is 4.5 stars. This is my go to place to consistent quality delicious Italian food in Richmond Hill. The recommendation came surprisingly from a odd source (a cemetery director), but I'm so glad we found this place. 
This place is seriously busy on weekends, to the point where we have waited up to 40 minutes to be seated. The food is definitely worth the wait!

On our first dining experience at Abruzzo, we ordered the Special pizza (bacon, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, pepperoni, cheese and tomato sauce), the Vince pasta (named after one of the owners, this pasta is one of my favourites), veal parmigiana (so tender!), a panzerotto (MASSIVE!) and a house salad. The service was on point, and it was a particularly nice touch that Vince himself came around to speak with the restaurant patrons. After chatting with my husband's family and myself, he even offered us complimentary cappuccinos. This first very positive experience, fantastic service, Vince's warm welcoming personality, and the delicious food is what keeps us coming back for more.

Several months later, our family makes a point of dining every several weeks at Abruzzo. We have since tried their lasagna, which was delicious the first time we tried it but a bit off on one occasion when green peas (?!?) were to be found in the sauce. The chicken wings (we favour the honey garlic flavour) are super crispy and addictive. The calamari was also nicely seasoned and tender. The Special pizza is still one of our go-to menu items. However the last time we dined in, a fellow patron mentioned that her go-to pizza contains roasted eggplant and anchovies, so we are looking forward to trying this combination on our next visit.

Don't let the non-descript sign and strip plaza location fool you. This is definitely one of the GTA's best places for pizza, pasta, and wings!

{"text":"Best pizza in the city, and free of pretentiousness. I've been coming here all my life. The real key is the flavourful dough, which almost every other pizza joint seems to forget is the entire foundation of the product! You can get a ponzo and not worry that you'll be eating bland bread. Toppings are solid plentiful. Service is nice and attentive. Go now and enjoy the tradition!"}
{"text":"Funnily what I enjoyed the most about Abruzzo wasn't the pizza but was for their giant panzerottis. If I'm ever in the area again,I would definitely consider getting those over their pizzas! 

For those of you who don't know what a panzerotti is, it's essentially  a pizza pocket, except like three times larger in size. You can get it fried or baked (we got baked, and it was similar to pizza dough). I absolutely recommend getting the tomato sauce as a side for the panzerotti. While there is a sufficient amount of tomato sauce within it, dipping it in the sauce makes it amazing! Their sauce is the perfect amount of sweetness and acidity. The panzerotti was delightfully cheesy. 

We also had their deluxe pizza is small size and it was thin crusted. There were plenty of toppings and it resembled a more western style of pizza. It wasn't greasy at all. The pricing could have been a bit for fair as $18 for a small is a bit steep"}
{"text":"This is what pizza is all about. Since I moved to Toronto about 4 years ago, I have regularly bemoaned the absence of Independent Pizza joints, particularly in the 905. What brought me here was the urge to have get away from the Pizza Pizza and their ilk, and to try to get that 'old pizza feeling' I used to get.

My wife and I set out to go to Abruzzo as we had driven by it many times. The place is in a small strip mall in Richmond Hill and it was packed, always a good portent. There were delivery drivers picking up their orders, people getting their take-out and dinners busy enjoying the kitchen's output.

We  waited a few minutes and found a table and our orders were promptly taken. I was attracted by their house salad which featured Italian Cold Cuts. I thought this would be the litmus test...the quality of the cold cuts that were going to be served. It has been my experience that the large majority of casual food joints will serve a highly commercial grade of salamis which do not resemble what you can purchase at your local deli. 

I was delighted when the salad arrived and I was able to taste \"real\" salami, and real shredded grated cheese, and real panchetta....'real' good in brief!

We ordered their large Abruzzo pizza, with thin crust and additional garlic. I does take about 20 minutes to get the pie maybe a little more, but I was enjoying the salad and feasting my eyes on what the other diners were ordering. Everything looked so good.

The pizza came and it was absolutely delicious. The crust was thin, evenly cooked and nicely crispy. The cheese is quite something and was extremely tasty and is simply much better than your run of the mill pizza cheese. The other ingredients were plentiful, as they do not obviously subscribed to strict pizza chains cost control measures. There was enough cheese, mushrooms, sausages and just the right amount of delicious sauce. It was a great pie!

The service is brisk and prompt and extremely efficient and pleasant. With regards to the cost it is about 35% more than the chains and is worth every penny. This is now the place I will come for Pizza....its further but worth it."}
{"text":"I've never been so sick in my life before, spent all night throwing up after eating their chicken parmesan sandwich. My friend's stomachs are also messed up, we all ordered chicken parmesan sandwiches last night. Never again.

**
Ps. I'm 99% sure it was due to the power outage experienced across Toronto from the ice storm. A lot of places lost power up to a week. A lot of restaurants probably tried to save money and salvage their food. It's not worth loosing customers over in the long run."}
{"text":"Another classic spot I grew up with. Lots of great memories. I'm impressed with the upgraded restaurant space. Abruzzo has consistently served me good food for at least 15 years. The staff are humble. There's great authenticity. The panzerotto is, without question, the best panzerotto in Toronto. 

Enjoy."}

{"text":"If you are in the mood for an old italian style pizza joint.  This is it.  Abruzzo's pizza is fresh and delicious with an excellent selection of fresh toppings.  For example they have atleast 4 kinds of peppers and none of them are soaked in vinegar.  The fried panzos are also mouth watering and delicious.  

The place is always full and attracts a very diverse crowd.  Great spot."}
{"text":"It seems like all the best places for pizzas in Toronto are not in Toronto.  Been going to this place since 2001 and they make a mean pizza that is on a par with Gigi's or Bitondos.  The pie is juicy, yet the crust remains crisp and tender and has good chew, but it is the sauce that I like most - bright, savoury and fresh tasting.  The pie strikes a nice balance between crust, sauce, cheese and toppings.  A simple, excellent, old school NY style pizza.  Panzos are very good as well but pricey."}
{"text":"I've been to Abruzzo several times. They've been around for a while now. I remember the first time i got take-out pizza from them I wasn't very impressed so I didn't go for several years until about last year. I had always heard very nice things about them so i thought I should give them a second chance. And man I'm glad i did. They have expanded a lot since then and have taken over most of the plaza they're in. In addition to their old takeout place they now have a decent sit-down restaurant as well. We have tried a few of their pizzas, their steak sandwich, they eggplant and veal parmigiana and we loved them all. This is good Italian/american food. Abruzzo feels like the favorite pizza joint that Raymond (Everybody Loves Raymond) or Tony Soprano would go to :) 

The service is always friendly and you're welcomed with a smile by the staff.

{"text":"I frequent this spot with my co workers for our \"Long Lunch Fridays\".  We always get the Panzo because well, that is what they are known for and they do not disappoint.  It comes out piping fresh from the oven and loaded with toppings (would they be called innings??)."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! 

Abruzzo has never disappointed in taste, presentation or portion of their meals over the years. The portions are very generous so expect to have some of your meal leftover for take-out (trust me, you'll want it later).

The options are endless but recurring favourites happen to be the lasagna ($13), a generous layering of soft, cheesy goodness, the panzerotto ($8), a large doughy turnover with an explosion of flavour, and, of course, the pizza ($10-20), a thinly crusted canvas of quality dough illustrated with your favourite combination of flavours. Based with tomato sauce and cheese, choose from a variety of other delicious toppings to decorate your pizza or panzerotto with for maximum satisfaction. 

My personal favourite: mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and pepperoni.

PRO TIPS: 

- Ask for chili flakes in your pizza, panzerotto etc. if you like it spicy
- Get the meat sauce and use it to dip your panzo/pizza or even to have with your lasagna!

{"text":"I've been ordering from Abruzzo's off and on for several years now. I've sampled their menu narrowly, moving through a variety of pizzas and their deliciously fatty sandwich menu.

I've never dined in, so my experience is limited to take outs and pick ups. First of all, this is not a full restaurant experience. They do have waiters but one of the additional reasons why I've never ventured in for a dine in experience is because, frankly it's not much at all to look at and I think even Pizza Hut provides better ambiance, sadly.

The food is pretty awesome. The sandwiches, while stuffed silly with mayo are a hot and deliciously addictive experience if you're looking for a guilty lunch. Just don't accuse me of plotting to fatten you up.

The pizza is something else entirely. Though I wasn't a fan when I first tried it, Abruzzo pizza has grown on me. The sauce is on the very salty side, making it difficult to resist a second and third slice. The crust tends to be thin unless customized and the toppings are thinly sliced but generously dolled out.

If you're planning a trip to Abruzzo be prepared to face a crowd at any given moment of the day. If you live in the area you're much better off ordering for delivery. I'm pretty sure they have ten delivery drivers on hand 24/7."}
{"text":"the most authentic pizza joint in my neighbourhood and conveniently down the street. every now and then i crave a slice and Abruzzo never disappoints. i always get a classic pepperoni slice and i usually inhale it within seconds while it's hot. as for the pies, the prices are higher than your average pizza place, but their ingredients are fresh and you definitely taste the difference. it's also the closest i'll get to NY slice! i can't remember when i sat down for a meal, it was probably a couple years ago."}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza in richmond hill/markham area. In a largely asian area, filled with Boston Pizza's and Pizza Huts, you might not think this is saying much, but as my friend said after taking her first bite:
\"This pizza is so good, I could cry.\"

The restaurant itself is set up more like a fast food or cafeteria joint -although a server does come to serve you!. There's vinegar and olive oil for your bread, and you can see all the herbs inside the olive oil. Yum! We ordered thin crust, but I felt the crust was still rather thick... not sure if we were given the wrong crust or if their thin crust is just not that thin. No matter, the pizza was still amazing. As soon as you bite in, you KNOW that pizza was made minutes ago, with super fresh ingredients. It's got that homemade feel that makes everyone so happy.  

All in all, it gets a big four stars from me, because now I know I can satisfy my pizza craving without going all the way downtown (as a point of reference, my fave pizza downtown is john's italian cafe on baldwin & papa ceos :) )."}
{"text":"You walk in, you smell a pizza shop just like it supposed to smell. You walk out and you smell like pizza.  These places are so hard to find these days.  You see the family owned business running it the way it supposed to be run.   You hear screaming, shouting, laughter, and smiles.  The ovens are probably like 60 years old and this is what makes them the best pizza you could possible ever have.    They are worked in through generations of families ordering their famous pies.   Now on to their food.  I would say their fried panzo is something very special.  It is on top of my list of best panzo on this universe.  The pizza is amazing too.  I am not a fan of their peperoni.  The wings are amazing.  Abruzzo salad is a salad that eats like a full meal.  I call it the hungry mans salad.  Full of meat, full of toppings.
Garlic bread is great.
This place never fails for takeout and delivery.  If you haven't had, have it and you will never want to order Pizza Pizza or any others again."}
{"text":"I had a panzerotti with extra cheese, mushrooms and beef. Deep fried. Not much to say - it was delicious, fresh and HUGE. 

ORDER AHEAD. My order took 15-20 min - everything is made to order.  The place itself isn't that friend to dine in. There is a really loud and mean Asian man who I guess controls the delivery guys? He was screaming at the delivery dudes and generally disregarding the fact that customers were sitting in the dining room. But I don't mine, that's what you get with a laid back homey type joint like this. Dining room is small, not that clean.

There are bathrooms, the girl's bathroom has like an elevated step to it? So be careful, don't trip. :) 

Would probably not come back because I'm generally not a fan of pizza/other bready things BUT i would absolutely recommend the panzo, being fair and all :))"}
{"text":"amazing!!

Always good always hits the spot! Only con is it gets really busy and sitting area is not the greatest,  but the food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after ordering from this place. I don't know whether it's the ingredients they use or general cleanliness but I will never order from them again.
FYI their delivery time is 1.5 h and we live about 10 minutes away from the restaurant"}

Pesto sauce is amazing.....
You should try ceaser salad..."}
{"text":"Really one of the best pizza spots in the city...fresh dough and sauce.  Amazing.  Calzone's are off the chart as well!"}
{"text":"best pizza in town hands down!!!u gotta try it and I assure u that you'll love it. Most of the times I get it to go cuz I'm not a sitting down eating pizza type of person but they also got a nice sitting area"}
{"text":"Well where to start. To start, everything was to incredible. The owners Sergio and Vince import their ingredients directly from Italy. Now coming from someone who spent an entire month eating real Italian food, Abruzzos food is so damn near close to it it's actually quite scary and amazing at the same time. I had heard many things about them but I wasn't really sure whether to believe them or not until I tried it. We started with some bruschetta. Next we moved onto fried calamari and some veal/chicken cutlets. These three dishes where the start of a night filled with outstanding food and good times. Next we ordered fried panzerotto's. I ordered mine with Italian sausage, cheese, and soppressata with meat sauce on the side. My girlfriend ordered one with just cheese. I didn't want to finish the whole thing because number one, it was a lot and I wanted to continue eating more food to try as much as possible before I popped, and number two I wanted to take it with me to continue eating the next day. Now I don't live in the area or even the country so I can't per say just mosey on over there to grab a bite to eat. Now back to the food. Lastly we were brought some zeppolis with zucchini and some with sardines. I personally don't like sardines but the ones with the zucchini were so flavorful and they didn't have that heaviness that some deserts have.  They were light and fluffy and I could probably eat them all night if I could. We even ordered a pie to bring back with is to the states because I wanted my family to enjoy what I had the pleasure to enjoy for an entire night. 
I don't like solely critiquing the food because it's not always about the food. It's also about the staff. Everyone on the staff was friendly, helpful, and full of great positive energy. 

I wish I lived closer because I would probably eat there at least once a week. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Abruzzos since the early 1980's. Still going. Need I say more? Fantastic pizza and panz."}
{"text":"It's like being in an Italian household.  If you are looking for a quiet place this isn't it.  Serve is good food is great"}
{"text":"For all who have lived in Richmond Hill for more than 5 years, you'll know what Abruzzo Pizza is.  You know a place is doing well when the plaza that Abruzzo's resides in is actually named after the store (Abruzzo Pizza Plaza).  I guess it's kinda hidden and you really wouldn't know it's there unless you knew it was there; or I guess if you were looking for something to eat around that specific plaza.  Upon entering, you'll notice an almost nostalgic pizza parlour feel.  I'm talking about red checkered tables with parmesan and pepper.  It's a place where everyone does know your name and you'll notice a lot of people saying \"hi\" to people (man... is Richmond Hill really that small?).  There isn't an evident menu, but I always order the same thing when I come here.

In my opinion, their specialty is their panzorotti; which comes in baked or fried varieties (personally I like the fried one, mmmm flavour).  You're given a pretty big assortment of toppings you can fill the panzorotti with but I think you're pretty safe with whatever you want.  My personal favourite topping is mushrooms and sausage.

What sets Abruzzo Pizza apart from all the rest of the herd is the local homemade taste and feel you get when you bite in.  They're not a cookie cutter pizza pie slinging franchise so you can definitely tell the difference.  They have everything from pizza to pasta but again, I usually just get the panzorotti when I come here.

Is it the best pizza I've ever had?  Probably not... but if there was a battle between pizza parlours you better believe that Abruzzo's would be one of the ones left standing."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles this is by far one of the best restaurants I have been
Great environment 
Delicious food
Refreshing beer"}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked I haven't reviewed Abruzzo's since I really enjoy this place. Anyway here it is. 
They make really delicious panzerottis, the deep fried one is better then the baked however it's deep friend, and is a bit oily. I consider it a really guilty pleasure and probably shouldn't eat it more then a few times a week (even though i really really want to). The baked panzo is good also, just not as great as the deep fried one. 
Their pizzas are thin crust styled and are very tasty. Something about the cheese they use is REALLY yummy. They have a dine-in side where I like to enjoy my pizza, it's not a huge place, so it gets busy sometimes but they have a full bar and great waiters/waitresses. I found them to be very friendly and helpful. This is the best pizza joint in the area, and there are 3 or 4 others in a 5 km radius of Abruzzos."}
{"text":"Your everyday neighbourhood pizza that's probably 10 times better than your regular pizza pizza but still affordable. It is always busy so be sure to order way in advance. Their pastas are mediocre."}
{"text":"Many people have asked why I would go to Richmond Hill for a pizza when there are many reasonable options in Toronto. This place came on my radar because of the sheer number of people who have reviewed it on another website and liked it.

I went for takeout but their new dining room looks very elegant yet casual. I went in around 4:30 midweek and couldn't believe how busy they were. They were quick to observe new patron and took orders promptly. Aside from myself there were about 10-15 people waiting and they appeared to be having trouble keeping up with phone orders despite 2 staff taking phone orders. Although they were extremely busy, the wait for take out orders was a reasonable 20 minutes at most.

I am not a vegetarian but have a 'thing' for vegetarian lasagna and don't see it on a menu as often as I'd like. This lasagna had lots of fresh vegetables and homemade noodles. The portion filled one of those aluminum take out containers with sauce just sneaking through the top. It was accompanied by an unexciting dinner roll and butter. I also ordered a pizza with spinach and extra cheese. They do not skimp on the toppings and all the ingredients seemed fresh. My main problem with this place was the tomato sauce seemed like your everyday, non-exciting, American tomato sauce. Not that fresh, homemade tomato sauce that I was expecting and looking forward to eating.

Price point is reasonable, certainly cheaper than some of their competitors. I doubt I will go out of my way to eat at this place again but if you lived inn the area and looking for good pizza, I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I'll let everybody else's reviews speak for mine.  The pizza was absolutely delicious, and I really can't complain!  Definitely worth the trip up into Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time here. Keep in mind that there are two entrances, the first one (door facing parking lot) is the pick up/take out area and the second (less visible door to the right, facing south) is to their dining room.

It's nicely set up, elegant but relaxed enough that you can be dressed casually and still feel comfortable. The young staff are all dressed elegantly in dark colours. Our server (young guy, dark hair, navy polo shirt and pants) was great! Friendly, helpful and professional!

We ordered the Special Pizza (large) and it was good. The thickness of the crust was ideal, not much tomato sauce (which was too bed) and next time I'd order it cooked more. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever eaten but it was good and I'd definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for pizza or what I usually come here for: a perfectly baked panzo with meat sauce. Service is great too! Their pastas are good overall, I have tried some, but I only come for the pizza or the panzo. Id rather go to other places that are better for pastas."}
{"text":"One of the oldest pizza places in Richmond hill. If you want to enjoy your meal this place is for you. Away fresh, no issues with delivery, little bit pricy but quality is really good. Food is tasty, if you have a lot of people get party size, it is huge."}
{"text":"Quality pizza. Ordered takeout from here. Crust was done perfectly, cheese was just right, toppings were generous and fresh. Very balanced flavour to the pizza that brought the ingredients all together nicely -- much better than the overly greasy or salty pizzas that you get at the major chains. Excellent choice for takeout or delivery in the suburbs, it doesn't get much better than this out in the boonies."}
{"text":"Great place! Found it on Yelp and gave it a shot. Good Panzorott1 and the pizza is solid as well. When in Toronto - we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pizza even though it was late at night to be consuming a high calorie item but what the heck! Cravings trump calorie counts! 

I had the calamari and Greek salad to start. The calamari was great and the sauce that accompanied the dish enhanced the flavours even more than eating the calamari by itself! I asked for  extra sauce because it was so good! The Greek salsa was also great! Simple yet refreshing! Our waitress informed us that the pizza was ready but to let her know when we were ready for it.

When our margherita pizza came it was piping hot! This pizza hit the spot real good! It was so cheesy unlike other pizzerias that skimp on the cheese! I couldn't finish the pizza so I took the rest home in their cute little takeout boxes! 

Best pizza in town! I'm so happy they open late so I can swing by when I'm getting the cravings again!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good tho better than I just ordered for delivery but just wait too long like around 45 min and so crazy on the weekend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm ordering the \"wrong stuff\" from Abruzzo or if it's really just not worth the hype, but my Abruzzo experiences have always been slightly sub-par at best. The pizzas are decent, the ingredients are always hot and fresh enough, but they just lack something special that I could probably just whip up at home. As a huge pasta fan, I've tried pretty much every pasta item on their menu and I've been disappointed each time - especially with the fettucine alfredo, holy blandness! I don't want to be entirely negative; they always delivery quickly, the food is hot, and the prices are really decent. However, if you're looking for a flavourful Italian dinner like mama used to make I would suggest you look elsewhere. The dishes here are just a bit too simple and bland if you're looking for an authentic Italian meal."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had! Fried Panzerotto is a must!!! Italian sausage is amazing! I love this place! I recommend this place to everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good! Reminded me a bit of NY pizza. Thin crust and crispy. My only thing is the waiting.. I can imagine a big line up during peak meal times. I would say it is definitely way better than standard pizza chains. Super cute little boxes for single portion which is much appreciated so you can eat in the car. Will be going back!"}

We had the following (took leftovers home)
Garlic bread -fine
Thin crust cheese pizza -delicious
Veal on a bun - kind of bland
Onion rings - huge portion
Gnocchi with tomato sauce and meatballs - good

We got there by 6pm on a Friday. It was packed by 615pm"}
{"text":"I'd driven past this place a million times on the way to my partner's house, and one Friday night I finally decided to place a take-out order. I was going to a potluck and thought cheesy garlic bread with marinara sauce would be nice to bring, but was sick of patronizing Pizza Pizza and other chains. I had seen the sign and assumed it would be a tiny, hole in the wall, mom and pop place. Wrong.

It is family-owned, but it's pretty big and popular. The dine-in area was BUMPIN... Nonnas and nonnos at every turn, and a line-up going out the door. It looked really nice and homey inside, and I was immediately drooling with the aroma. Anyway, I was redirected to the take-out storefront next door, and was handed my order by the friendly staff.

The cheesy garlic bread was delicious, and was the first dish to disappear at the potluck. I will definitely be back to try the panzerottos, pastas, and pizzas!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza in town, I'm visiting from California and definitely in love with the flavors of your dough and sauce. 
I order over the phone and got great customer service, the girl was nice, she really took the time to make sure to place the order correctly.
Thank You."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Abruzzo special pizza (loads of toppings), a large caeser salad, and two desserts.  The total came to $30+.  I was hoping for the pizza to be more than average - especially from the reviews.  The toppings were definitely fresh but the pizza dough itself was a bit too tough for my liking.  The caeser salad was awesome (for a green leafy salad).  The desserts were your run of the mill commercial tiramisu and cadbury chocolate mousse.  I was not impressed - I had hoped that Abruzzo did something a little different.  For the price, and the final experience, I am afraid to say I could have gone with the more common pizza vendors.  

On a scale of things considering I was starving and pizza's not my favorite dinner in the world - the fact that I only had 1 slice of pizza and then buried myself in the salad was enough for me to rank this a 3 star rating.  (I have had pizza where I"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down. I'm not big on pizza and I find most pizza joints aren't that great. But this one is the  best I've had. You can really taste the high quality of the ingredients they use. The staff are friendly and courteous. I moved up to Bradford, but  still drive down to Richmond hill whenever I feel for pizza, I never go anywhere else."}

{"text":"I can dig a place like Abruzzo! 

This pizza place is actually huge. It has a take out unit, a delivery unit and a dining unit but don't mix them up! My date went into the wrong door (delivery) and was immediately told to leave.

We ordered panzos for take out last night and was left needing more. Although it was dinner time, the wait was pretty long so keep that in mind. Our wait was about 50 minutes for two panzos and two sides of tomato sauce.

The panzorotti was the size of a football! I stuffed mine with onions, green peppers, bacon and black olives and it was baked to perfection. Not 100% sold on the tomato sauce but it was still pretty good. It took me about an hour to eat the beast. All in all, I enjoyed my first Abruzzo experience and it certainty won't be my last.

NOTE: I initially wrote this review with a 4 star rating because I thought I've had better, but when I actually sit down and think about it, this is the best so far. I've changed my rating to a fiver."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, nice place love the decor. Good staff and we didnt wait long for our food."}
{"text":"Always go here with the family, honestly you can order anything and it's amazing, but the special salad and the fried panzerotti are my favorite! Always great service even if it gets busy."}
{"text":"This place makes the best pizza in town! We ordered a small basic pizza and some garlic bread with cheese. That's more than a healthy amount of serving for two. 

The pizza crust had an amazing crispness to it and yet it was not chewy. The slices were divided imperfectly and that gave us a cozy feeling - a confirmation that humans have prepared the food. A very well-rounded and a balanced pizza! Must try!

The fellow who was serving us checked in twice to make sure we were doing okay. The service was quick and very friendly. The place was clean, great  ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem in Richmond Hill for some authentic Italian pizza (not that I've been to Italy...). The crusts are the perfect density and the tomato sauce used is top notch good stuff. We orders three pizzas and an appetizer among six people and there was left over. 

I recommend to anyone looking for an amazing meal!"}

{"text":"After years of hearing about Abruzzo, I finally prepared myself for a nice treat. I got a caesar salad with chicken and a meatball sandwich that me and my bf split. The caesar salad was alright, I liked the fact the dressing didn't taste like most caesar dressings. It was very creamy but a little TOO creamy for my liking and not enough garlic. However, the meatball sub was done right. I'd suggest not doing delivery if you have the option of picking it up yourself, the wait times are a little over an hour. But for my first time, I was pretty pleased :)


*****

I had to edit this. I decided to have it delivered, not only was it over an HOUR late when they told me 45 minutes....but the delivery man who was a rude, arrogant asshole, threw my food at me, scoffed at me, almost broke our business' door, and was yelling on his way out as if i didn't pay him. RELAX. Never get it delivered and i had to bump it down a star, hopefully this asshole is fired immediately.


******

Yepp I have had enough. Hoping things may change in 2014, I had it delivered ONE MORE TIME, and it was definitely my LAST TIME! It was an hour late again, I called in and the guy told me to be patient although he said it'll be 45 minutes, the delivery guy was so late I only tipped him 2 dollars for a salad which should be more than enough and he counted the change. THEN I FIND OUT THEY OVERCHARGED ME TOO. Never ever in a million years they've done this every single time I had it delivered. I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever. We were starved so to avoid the long line up for a table we opt to sit at the bar. We ordered two beers and two individual pizzas with our own  toppings. The pizzas arrived we were so hungry I was down to my last two slices when i realized I hadn't taken a picture to share on YELP. Hence my 2 slice picture if my delicious pizza. The only negative i had was when ordering my pizza our server miscommunicated all toppings were part of the price of the pizza on the menu. I was upset when my bill arrived and i was charged $1.75 per topping. My individual pizza ended up being more expensive than i had wanted to spend. I will go back snd be more mindful on the toppings I order. 
They also have a full  Italian menu. 
They have takeout and delivery.   Lots of parking. Staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Really great panzerotto and pizza. I just find it a bit inconvenient to order more toppings (they're like 2.50 each), especially since I like to eat a lot and I'd like to try all the toppings. Great Atmosphere, service, and food"}
{"text":"Best Italian pizza in Richmond Hill hands down. Fresh, flavourful, top quality ingredients. Panzorotti are also top-notch, I opt for the baked option and definitely require a meat sauce. Haven't tried too much else as far as other menu options (pasta, veal, etc.) They also do a very tasty Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Abruzzo is a wonderful dine-in pizza experience compared to what we are all exposed to in our social media age, take-out or delivery. Although the much sought after choice seeing that we are accustomed to having pizza as a staple at almost any gatherings, intimate or group. Cheap, fast and reliably everywhere!

This dynamic combination of doughy goodness and cheese IN A BOX is forgotten because you devour everything in sight once it reaches your table at Abruzzo's accompanied with their caesar salad and espresso to end the meal for a quick energy revival.

Prices are reasonable for the quality and portions you get and the staff, ambiance is warm and inviting.
We paid about $65 for 1 pizza, large salad, garlic bread and a cheese panzerotti, 2 iced teas and 2 espressos! You be the judge, but for me, this place is home to long talks over good pizza."}

{"text":"This is a place that a family friend had always told us to go to, and always brought over food from this place.

Food is authentic italian, amazing sauce, I give it a 10/10.

Though if you're trying to save a buck or two, I would recommend getting take out and bring it home to eat, dishes are about 2-3$ more expensive to eat inside the restaurant and portion is exactly the same.
Dine in only has whole pizza, does not serve single slices even though take out next to it does have it.
My 10 yr old cannot finish an entire pizza, so we were stuck with sharing.

Panzerotto here is amazing, I can say food is unbeatable!

Service... is not the best for the price they charge.
What bugged me the most was when the lady came to give me the machine, she was standing RIGHT next to me the entire time and continued to stare right at the number pad the entire time I was entering my pin even after I looked at her for a second.
Not even a \"Thank you\" when handing the bill or when I was done paying.

But for the food, I would still come back :)"}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL if you value yourself! We were there last night with a group of friends, ordered a bunch of pizzas, the food quality was not so great (3 out of 5 tops) but that aside one of us ordered their Special Pizza and asked for italian sausage to be added as extra topping. The food is on the table no sausage is added. So we nicely asked the handsome waiter about it and he confirmed that the topping was not added and offered to take the pizza back to the kitchen, add the topping, put it in the oven and bring it back. We didn't want to wait any longer so told him that it's fine like that. Later we asked for the checks and my friend who ordered the extra topping finds out that he is charged for it. So again he nicely asks the waiter to remove it from his check. The waiter goes back to his manager, next thing you know the manager is at our table with pieces of sausage in her hand showing it to us saying with attitude: \"this is italian sausage, you know? Can I see the pizza which didn't have it added?!\" Are you serious?!! Who in their right mind would possibly question the ability of their customer to recognize sausage(!!!), just to save a few bucks?!! Kudos to the nice waiter for handling the situation and his rude manager in a professional manner. Was my first time there and will be my last."}
{"text":"Again we tried a place after looking at how crowded it always is. It's dinning place looks really nice and on Sunday evening also was pretty crowded with wait of 10 minutes. Service was little slow. I was expecting a lot from Pizza sauce but tasted same old and did not impress me a lot. You are served Chilli oil (at no extra costs) on request, which added a good flavour to our pizza and not many outlets serve it. But the best part was panzerotto served with amazing homemade Mariana sauce(we were surprised it was charged extra). We tried basic baked version stuffed with tomato sauce and cheese and loved it. Also coffee was typical Italian and liked that too. I would come over again for panzerotto and next time would try some other stuffing."}
{"text":"It was good, definitely better than any commercial pizza. The service is so good and the special pizza is awesome, the salad quite average."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not a fan of their garlic bread. And a bit pricy but it's worth it on occasion. Will continue to buy from here."}
{"text":"reminds me pizza day 20 yrs age in elementary school...mmmmm! 
i don't know how anyone can hate this place, it's always super yummy!
they give out coupons all the time for certain $ off diff prices you spend
i think our family gets take out once/month, if you're close just drive to pick it up bc their delivery seems quite busy and may have to wait/risk cold pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years with my family or with friends the food is very good nothing that blows me away but very good everything I have tried has been great I would recommend and pizza or the calamari but really anything your good with as a far as the staff go very welcoming at least most of the time it is quite packed in there most of the time but they try to get you seated asap overall I have been very pleased and if I am ever looking for some good Italian food there is a good chance this is where I will go"}
{"text":"Love this place it's known for take out and delivery pizza but I really recommend eating in. Service is great calamari is yum and the veal excellent and love the abbruo salad .. Also very inexpensive for the quality ... Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"We decided to try it after reading all these reviews. I'm gonna say I've had WAYYYY better at Nonna's Oven in Elgin Mills and Woodbine for about the same price (if you consider all the toppings they add). 

We tried the baked AND the fried Panzos to see if we liked either, and the fried Panzo was disgusting!!!!! Deep fried pizza dough just does not taste good and gets soggy really quickly. The baked one was what I expected and was decent but nothing to write home about. 

I'm not sure what people are saying about the BEST panzo's... I definitely would NOT agree. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Our favourite pizza delivery place hands down.  Beats the Dominos, Pizza Pizzas and those places by a mile - hands down."}
{"text":"Oddly, I don't really care for their pizza, and I find it incredibly pricey for what it is.

Ordered a large special pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, onion, bacon) and a small caesar salad for delivery and paid $40something. Wayyyyy too much for the quality of the pizza. I would prefer dominos any day, and they offer a large 4 topping for $11.99! Figure that out.

Their caesar salad is amazing tho. That's where they earn the three star review. I would go there just for the salad.

Other than that won't get pizza there again. Nothing special.

Would I return? - Only for salad
Parking? - Small lout out front of strip plaza
Value for $? - Poor
Space? - Small place for eat-in. Can take out or they deliver to select area.
Ventilation? - Good
Service? - Good"}
{"text":"Abruzzo has some of the best Italian sandwiches in the area for under $10. Their veal sandwich is sublime. They are known for their pizzas but I personally don't think they're that special."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great. I'm strict about putting the meat options on LAST, so they crisp up. I'm also a fan of a crisp crust. Their crust is ok, sauce ok, but I wouldn't say it's the best, but I think everyone has very specific ideals of the 'perfect' pizza. We ordered a pasta dish for take out and I wouldn't order it (or any other pasta) again. I know it's a popular place and it always seems busy. Maybe we have to go there for eat-in, vs. take out. Sorry, but I'd rather have PizzaPizza"}
{"text":"To satisfy my hubby's wanting of meat, and my needing to eat vegetables, we ordered a medium Abruzzo Special Pizza.  This pizza came topped with tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, bacon, and onions.  I guess it's the equivalent of a deluxe pizza.  We also ordered a small greek salad.  When the pizza was brought home, we quickly dove into it.  The crust had a nice chew, probably would have been slightly crispy and chewy if we had eaten it at the restaurant.  But loved the crust anyway (just as good reheated in the toaster oven the next day).  The pizza also had a good amount of toppings too.  For the salad, the ingredients were fresh and was very good size, considering it was a small."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good.. I added random toppings.. Extra tomatoe sauce on the pizza,  Mozzarella and Goat cheese, anchovies, lol, chicken and pineapple. I also got the ceaser salad and lasagna.. The salad was okay.. I think it could of used more flavor.. it was missing something.. it wasn't bad, nor was it good.. I found it okay personally and a bit soggy (take out). The lasagna wasn't bad, but it has way to much cheese.. I rather more sauce, then just a pile of cheese (I find that kind of gross). To little cheese would of been dry, so it's definitely not that I hate cheese but so much cheese? Really? It's a little much. I gave it 4 stars, simply because of the pizza. I would definitely order the pizza again and try other items, if I ever do order from here again. The pizza was fresh and tasty. I recommend the pizza"}

Come to Abruzzo Pizza for the food... Don't take your date here if so she will be disappointed.. 

Abruzzo is located at a strip mall... surrounded by mattress and furniture stores. Since it is in Richmond Hill, at least I don't have this seedy feel. 

2 areas of the restaurant, one is for pick up and the other area for sit down lunch/dinner. The sit in area is more basic remind me of a cafeteria set up... 

On a Friday afternoon... for late lunch, this place was quite busy.. There are at least 3 cars with the Abruzzo Pizza signs on their roofs going in and out of the parking lot doing delivery! 

Vince Special Pasta Fusilier ($12.50) 
- includes Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Fresh Hot Peppers, Garlic and Light Tomato Sauce 
- Filling and hearty 
- the Italian Sausage is really lean remains me of Chinese preserved sausage... and it is not salty to my surprise 

Abruzzo Special Pizza Small ($13.50) 
- Consists of Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Bacon & Onions 
- The crust is thin but not dried... still have this oh so good I am eating carb feel 
- The ingredients are generous and yes and filling! 

I cannot say Abruzzo Pizza is authentic Italian pizza... but is a good option compare to other chain pizza joint!

Services here is efficient and friendly... a good family vibe! I do have a feeling I am eating at one of the pizzeria down at Little Italy instead all the way up at the Burbs!! 

Open for lunch only from Tue - Fri. They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"I love this place! First time orderer, I got a large, thick, garlic, extra cheese, mushroom, onion, and hot soppressata (however it's spelled). Delicious! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Prices.
I've been coming here for years.
I really enjoy the Chicken Marsala, Veal Milanese and the Pasta Carbonara, plus everything else!
Open until midnight tonight!"}
{"text":"This place is great! And it delivers far. I use to live at yonge and finich and it still delivered to my house! 

Oh and the food is soo good fried Panzo is amazing!!! Lasagna is really gd. The only bad thing I can say is I really want some now!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating their pizza for years now ( nearly 8 years) and it was good before, but for past few times now ( within a 1-2 years), i have noticed the quality of food and customer service has gone down ridiculously!! 
For instance, I called on Friday evening at 5:30 pm to inquire if they had availability for dining and the girl in the phone very reluctant to check said \" you have called on our take out side and I can't tell you how long it will be, you'll just have to come in and check\". WTH! What restaurant says that and also doesn't transfer call to the dining side of the restaurant???

Anyway, bottom line is there are much better Italian places in the town and I rather take my business elsewhere where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. Ordered specialty pizza and a panzo to share.
The Panzos here are HUGE and delicious. Fried option is much better than baked (worth the extra calories). It goes well with a side of dipping sauce. We really enjoyed the panzo

The specialty pizza was not up to my expextation today. I had pizza here before and remember it was better. Today my pizza was soggy. The bacon was still white and soggy. 

Service was ok; food took a long while to arrive today. Loved the panzo and disappointed with the pizza. Traffic is bad in this area during rush hours. Will give it another try when I'm in the area in the future"}
{"text":"Definitely different from the franchise pizza shops.  Thinner crusts, saucy and cheesy, however not so delicious that makes it special."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Their lasagna is very good, One of the best lasagna I had, I had mine with meat sauce.  My friends had pizza, chicken and beef parmesans and there were happy with it. Their salad was good too and it comes in very large portion.  I also recommend thier coffee. The pasta and tiramesu was not that good. The price was a little high for the food and service they offer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

It was my first time visiting this establishment. It was surprisingly busy even at 8:30 in the evening. We didn't have to wait long at all to be served and for the food to arrive. The tables were nicely spaced out and I felt very comfortable eating here. We ordered the homemade lasagna (meat), Sergio's pasta using fusilli and Vegetarian pizza. 

I found the pizza to be a little bit too bland but at least it wasn't oily, salty, dry or soggy. The cheese and tomato don't have a \"kick\" to them. I don't like a lot of pizza because I find the dough and crust to be too dry but it was not a problem here. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza came steaming hot. You can add as many toppings/ingredients as you want for $1.75 each (for a small pizza) which I find very reasonable.

The lasagna was disappointing because it felt pretty dry eating it even though there was more than enough tomato sauce on top of it. I think it's because there was egg in between the layers and it made it seem drier than it should have been. Overall, it wasn't terrible but my neighbour could make the dish much better than what I had (my neighbour would be so happy if she reads this comment).

I felt like the pasta was the best dish. It was simple with tomato sauce, zucchini and chicken. I ordered 2 meatballs for $3 and the meatballs felt very homemade.

I was very happy with the large portions and while the food is certainly not high-end Italian cuisine, it definitely matched the price. They take a lot of credit cards including American Express which was a surprise. They do dine-in, take-out and delivery."}
{"text":"Abruzzo's is a family run business that is a community favourite.  This was one of the first places I tried when I moved into Richmond Hill, almost 20 years ago.
The left most part of place was the pickup/order/entry into the place.  It was always packed with people coming and going, along with their drivers.  It is now only for the drivers.  The middle part now - pick up now - was the restaurant.  The old restaurant was a bunch of tables setup with a really old bar and a couple of the family and friends delivering goods from the kitchen.  It was as casual as can be.
Today, the new restaurant is more modern and has a nice little bar area.  It suits the Abruzzo family oriented clients.  A great success story of hardworking people.
Now to the food.  Some like the food.  I love the food.  Their Abruzzo Special Pizza is the best.  Some swear by the over-sized panz/calzone - another favourite.
What makes their food so good is the care they take in shredding the cheese everyday and preparing their own sauce.  I have been known to buy containers of sauces at their take-out place.
For those of you outside of the delivery area, make a trek and have a dinner or do some take out.
Mangia-Mangia!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating pizza from Abruzzo when I lived at Yonge and 16th; my mom would REFUSE to get pizza from anywhere else.  When I went to visit RH last weekend after a trip to Vaughan Mills, my gf and I stopped in for a bite and even she said that it was one of the best pizzas she's ever had and she's pretty picky about pies.  Good job. Well worth the money.  Wish they deliver south of Finch though since we live downtown."}
