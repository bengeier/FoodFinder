{"text":"This is a \"go out of your way\"  and \"must have\" sandwich shop. Quite possibly the best gourmet sandwich shop in the city. If your looking for 30 second drive through express, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a mouthgasam, this shack is worth the wait tenfold! The sandwiches are massive, saucy masterpieces that have very generous helpings of actual meat and topped with plenty of sauce and other goodies to make it a very very tasty experience. The sandwich comes with a small bag of chips for a palate clense, and a giant wedge of pickle....  Oh the pickle! The staff is very friendly and the pricing is worth every penny! If your on McLeod heading North look for the bright green shack, don't blink or you might miss it, but if you do, hang a hard U and get back there to order up a Smokin' Joe! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and it's definitely awesome.  The ingredients are fresh and has a lot of flavor.  They must call it crumbs because that's all that is left over after biting into one of these delicious sandwiches. 

The portion of the sandwiches are huge!  you can get 2 meals out of one sandwich.  
The meat to bread ratio is perfect, which is something most places are terrible at.  
Everything from the bread, veggies, and meats are very fresh and i'm pretty sure the sauces are all homemade they taste really fresh.  

Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been to this fantastic little shack multiple times and it never disappoints. Mo is always extremely friendly and makes you feel very welcome. The sandwiches are face meltingly good (that's right, face meltingly) and MASSIVE! You definitely get your money's worth. Mayweather is my favorite (sandwich, not boxer) but they are all incredible in their own way.

Definitely strap on your feed bag and head over. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch that has so much flavour! The sandwiches are large. I hope you're hungry. The sandwiches are made on buttery ciabatta bread piled high with your fillings of choice and heated using a panini press.  All served with fresh kettle cooked chips & a pickle."}
{"text":"Noticed this tiny little shack the other day while driving to work. I decided to hit it up later in the week. We opted to park our car instead of driving through. I ate the Mayweather, a pastrami sandwich. It came with a pickle spear and a small hand-packed baggy of plain chips. Ordering at the window and sitting at the picnic tables was pretty nice. My sandwich was pretty fresh and nice tasting, but perhaps a little heavy on the dressing side. I could have used a few more chips with my meal too, but over all it was good.  I don't think I'd want to sit in my car and wait, but they were expediting the ordering process well by coming out and taking orders from the next car."}
{"text":"The menu has changed!!! No sandwiches, just mediterranean...

Super bummed. Don't get me wrong, falafels and donairs are delicious, but they're no deli sandwich with chips, and a pickle.

All I wanted was a delicious deli sandwich, but all that stood in front of me was quinoa, donair, samosas, and falafels. I felt like crying. I am heartbroken."}
