{"text":"Every week my kids and grandkids come over and we go out to dinner or have something delivered, I wanted to try a different Chinese restaurant so we decided to try China King restaurant.  I ordered a quart of sweet-and-sour chicken, A quart of sweet-and-sour pork, 2 orders of crab Ringos, 11 eggrolls, a quart of Beef and broccoli and 2 Small pork fried rice .I think the chicken had a rubber texture . and they only gave me 8 eggrolls and I ordered 11 , Needed to give more fortune cookies only gave me 5 they should've figured out I was ordering for a Family of 11. I will try them again. Hope they do better next time, I didn't know they delivered So I have to try that next time."}
{"text":"i was at home yesterday because i woke up not feeling so well but around 1pm i started to feel hungry and didn't know what i wanted. i thought \"what can i get that's easy to order and nearby and easy to pick up?\" i had a hankerin' for some Chinese take out and decided to check my Beyond Menu app. there, i found that Food King was available from which to order and i did. i ordered Kung Pao chicken, an egg roll and some wonton soup. 
while not as good as places like Nam Wah in Berea, Food King was damned good for a small take out place and I'll definitely be back for more. yum."}
{"text":"Food king is pretty good. The place is small so I wouldn't recommend eating in but it is great for take out or delivery. Not to many Chinese places deliver so this was a bonus. It takes about 20 minutes which isn't bad at all. The food is very good, I always finish it. For the price you can't beat it. Food king is a simple and great dinner option."}
{"text":"Update: Well here I find myself a year later in the same situation. Wife is out of town for work, baby's in bed, it's 7:45p and I'm starving. Not being able to leave I had to get delivery and as long as your order is $12 or more Food King is happy to do it. Tonight I went with 2 egg rolls, small order of boneless ribs, and small vegetable lo mein sans carrots. Once again everything was good, nothing wowed, and I was pleased with my order. The egg rolls were a little bland but some soy sauce and spicy mustard fixed them right up. My order arrived piping hot in about 30 minutes. The current void in my life has been filled. Thank you Food King. See you in about 365!"}
{"text":"Last-minute decision sitting on the deck to order Chinese..... It was a great call Szechuan beef extra spicy add mushrooms came up perfect very quick in delivery! Definitely will be my next call for Chinese food in Brunswick!"}
{"text":"I'm wavering between 1 or 2 stars. I'm going with 2 bc I have only tried their food once. But once was enough. I ordered delivery, which was fine...timely and courteous. But the most important part was the food. Not good. I ordered General's chicken and it was almost all gross pieces of fatty gristle. My gf's order of teriyaki was not teriyaki, or if it was it was the worst we have ever had. I'll upload pics of it. I didn't like the rice bc it tastes very artificial.  However, the egg roles were good along with the fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Was passing by the area, and decided to stop for dinner.  What a great place for delicious Chinese food!  Singapore mei fun, beef and snow peas, and chicken teriyaki were all fantastic. Only four tables to eat at, more of a take out place, but we ate in with no problems."}
{"text":"I have ordered here several times and have never been disappointed. Food is good and hot even when delivered."}
{"text":"Small little place with incredible food. Ordered for delivery, received it quickly, and my family loved it.  I will definitely add Food King to our delivery rotation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Food King. It could just be that I grew up eating here, but it is inexplicably my favorite Chinese food (and I have tried a LOT of Chinese places). It's not that any one menu item stands out, but everything on their menu is just good, and the quality has been consistent over the literal hundreds of times I have eaten there over the past decade. 

The chicken lo mein lunch special is my favorite, but I also like the General Tso's and the beef and broccoli. Flavorful egg rolls and great wonton soup. I plan to keep trying new places, but Food King will forever be my gold standard. Can't wait for the next time we're in Brunswick!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a whim trying to find a local Chinese restaurant that would deliver. With a name like \"Food King\" i cant lie, i was a bit skeptical. From what I can tell there are not many in the area! I was so pleasantly surprised!  I have gotten the Singapore Mei Fung a few times now and it's always amazing! ! When I order online they usually deliver within 30 minutes and are very friendly and polite! Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Not good. Dry chicken and rice. Looked gross. Red teriyaki chicken. Egg roll decent. 
Maybe it would've tasted better after several cocktails!!!!!
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Quick, straightforward and good portion size. If you're looking for take out, check them out. Food is pretty good and you get plenty of it. Hits the spot! General Tso's is the BEST and crab rangoon is super tasty!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for a cheap price. The lunch special is only $5 and some change! I have to be a little vague though since I only get the General Tso's Chicken and chicken fried rice but it is damn good! I would prefer it to be a little more spicy but it has a sweet and savory flavor that is delicious.

I really don't have any complaints. I can't say it's dirty, but the d√©cor is so out dated (much like any other Chinese restaurant). I'd really like to see some updates. It's in a good location and has a quaint vibe about it that could really be great if they \"trendy-ed\" it up a bit!"}
{"text":"Good food / good service / solid selection of dishes.  I've ordered at least 20 times from this restaurant (all delivery) and each time I was very happy with the food & service. Will be ordering again soon. Sweet & sour chicken is a real crowd pleaser (especially if you have kids)."}
{"text":"Food king is not very fancy, but every time we order from them it is terrific! Actually prefer food king to p f changs, consistent , no bad surprises. Prices are more than fair,"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Chinese food, but this place is good. It's a small nondescript place concealed in a strip mall; the same strip as McDonald's, Fat Bob's, and the new Planet Fitness. I would never have tried this place had it not been for great reviews on the community Facebook page. I also love the fact that they deliver and the delivery fee is only $1. I had the General Tso's chicken and a couple eggrolls. Reading the reviews, it seems as though they have a lot of solid choices. I predict that I will be ordering from this place at least two or three times a month. Good stuff!"}
