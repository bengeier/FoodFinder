{"text":"Good food. Needs an extra window near the fireplace. Kinda dark. Could use a more attentive waiter type for refills, condiments, etc. (Like  a chik fil LA -ish person) . Decent small southern food joint that could use the restaurant impossible/ bar recuse help in many ways. And more smiles on the staff's faces. But hey....ur way out in rural Union county....its not like u have other close by choices.... Unless u consider Roughedge a sit down joint."}
{"text":"Place is small and seems like a locals only type place. The man taking our order wasn't the friendliest but got our order right. The burgers are very good, could  have used more bacon for the price but was very good and fresh. One of the better burgers I have had in Charlotte hate its a good little drive from the house."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with about 6-7 red & white checkerboard table cloth covered tables. Reasonable priced menu with daily specials. They have burgers, dogs, sandwiches, pizza, salad, wings, and a few platters.

There is a small porch out from with table and chairs. The chili they put on burgers and hot dogs is a bit much and drowns the food. You get your own refills of tea by using the Urns near the check out. I am sure the plate dishes are good too they sounded good. Everything seems to be made to order since ours took a little while and came out HOT."}
{"text":"This place is closed.  Has another sign up with a different name.  Didn't try it."}
