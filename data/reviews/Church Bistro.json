{"text":"Food - 4.5/5. Ordered the tandoori chicken omlette and bengali spicy omlette. Both were great in flavor! Could have added some more fruit on the side but that's a minor point.  Service - 5/5. Great service. Owner was a great host and service was amazing  Ambiance was great too."}
{"text":"Really nice host and the food was original and tasty. Also a nice spot to take a break while exploring the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Found employees to be extremely rude.  Go here if you want to be demoralized."}
{"text":"Horrible experience... I will just quickly list the things that happened. 1. The waiter walked away as I was ordering my drink. Brought the wrong one. When I asked for another he walked away yet again before I was finished speaking and brought the wrong drink yet again. 2. All drinks were warm even with ice. They even added ice to warm chocolate milk. The chocolate milk was mixed. 3. Food came and we didn't have silverware. Delivered by a waitress.  4. There wasn't ketchup or jam  on table. 5. We asked and waited over a min and a half and still nothing.  6. The waiter saw me getting up to find silverware, he handed me a 'ketchup'. It wasn't ketchup it was barbecue sauce. Luckily I only added a small potion when I realized.  7. A min and a half later silver ware came without jam.  8. A min and a half later a small portion of jam arrived. So around 5 min of waiting our toast was cold. 9. The worst part was when I was asked how the meal was I said I had a few suggestions. The waitress ran away and the waiter replaced her. I mentioned to mark the barbecue sauce better. And before I finished speaking he said, \" people make mistakes.\" I calmly said, \" I was just giving a suggestion.\" He said \"sir, it's just ketchup its not a big deal.\" I didn't say another word. This place will closed within a year.   Message to you owners of Church Bistro There is a reason why the place next door is packed with groups of people and you have 3 customers.  You have poor service. If you don't change your ways you will be closed."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. Spend your money somewhere else! there are plenty of other amazing places where you can get way better food for even less money than here. Ewww"}
{"text":"Staff need to relax. Constant hovering and questioning. Very awkward server who's eyes lingered a little too long and who made a few too many off colour comments. Plus he was in his 50s at least and dressed Like a frat boy from the 90s, popped collar and all. Which is not a good appearance for a server.   Food was okay. Home fries cold and not friend well, totally over seasoned. Also had unnecessary peppers on it. Eggs weren't cooked as ordered for either myself not my friend. About a quarter of a banana cut in half given to you in the skin is next to a whisper of watermelon. Not appealing. The white toast was good."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim. Lunch. The burger with green chilies was perfect. The potatoes are done with saffron and tandoori spices. Excellent change from the everyday. I gave a 4 not a five because I want them to have more on the menu. My problem more than theirs. Definitely will be back for brunch and dinner"}
{"text":"I meet up with a group of friends here and it was quite a disappointing experience.  I am a kind of person who is always punctual but I arrived late. When I arrived and not even 30 seconds have passed, the male employee asked if we were ready to order. I haven't even taken off my jacket...of course I was not ready and he stood there just staring at us. Not awkward at all... Another minute has past, I haven't even finish looking at the drink menu and a female employee came and ask if we were ready and of course I was not.   Finally, I decided on what to get and I got the Western Omelette. Honestly, this was not a good omelette as it came lukewarm. There was a lot of diced vegetables and not that much meat. The potatoes were cold as well and the small amount of fruits did not give the dish any justice. I never had such a dissatisfying omelette dish before.  Service was not that great as the employees should give the customers some time and not be so pushy.  I would not come back here for brunch."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious and was the most hospitable service ever! The restaurant hosts were very accommodating for our large group. They above and beyond to prepare a spicy appetizer, in addition to their set dinner menu. The food was good, but the service was most memorable:) The hosts were very patient and gracious with the entire service, even though it was very busy. I would definitely come back to try the brunch menu :) Thank you Church bistro for a fantastic Winterlicious experience:)"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. The decor and atmosphere was very welcoming complemented by the light-hearted music. There were very comfortable cushions that you don't see in other restaurants and it felt as comfortable as sitting in your own living room. The owner and chef were very pleasant and easy to make conversations.   The food was awesome! I had the Turkey & Eggs a la Benedict, it was an Indian/French fushion dish that was well put together. The Turkey was tender with indian styled spices, and somehow it really blended well with the Egg Benedict. I love spicy so it was made with more spice, but you can customize out of a range of 10. The salad and sweet potato chunks were great sides too, very sizable portions. I also ordered a Mimosa (not conventional for brunch but I just wanted to try it). Good choice, it complements the dish and soothes the spiciness.   Definitely a recommend. My friend and I had brunch there but I think this place would be great for dinner too."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Friday. The waiter was new and was super nice. The place was cozy. 2 stars for those reasons. That's where the love fest ended. We ordered Calamari that tasted just ok. It was so greasy though that we both felt awful after.   Our main meals sounded promising but what we received was of a quality I could have purchased at Walmart and made myself. I actually don't purchase such low quality food. Very disappointing. We were hoping to find a great new goto restaurant.  No way."}
{"text":"The good, the bad and the ugly, in that order: The samosas are perfect. The broth of the French onion soup is authentic - it came with a poppadum which melted in the mouth, for an interesting twist. The sea bass was terrible. It's a light, delicate fish with a strongly-flavoured dark orange coating that over powered it (after it was in the oven on a piece of tin-foil because it came not cooked - that's translucent inside). The veal went into the garbage. It was two pieces of gristle: too tough to cut and impossible to chew. The vegetables that came under the fish were grey-green peas/corn/beans (ugly, so went into the garbage) with some roasted potato wedges which were surprisingly good. The potatoes that came on the side for the veal were accompanied by zucchini, carrots, baby bok choy with rosemary and they were very good. Bottom line: get the samosas and the soup but make your own roasted potatoes because you can. The entrees were money burned and Foodora doesn't even have a place to write a review."}
{"text":"If you want a cute east meets west getaway where you can escape to the back patio for an authentic rustic vibe please try Church Street Bistro. The food is a combination of traditional Canadian with an Indian flair. The personal attention to your visit is a great touch. Price is fair and the food is a touch above pub."}
{"text":"This was yet another post GoT meal selection.  Service is friendly and the restaurant is warm and inviting even though I accidentally knocked over a small plant on my way out.  Sorry!  I think the prices are a little on the higher end of the spectrum from the menu provided but I think there are some real value dishes hidden within.  I eventually settled on one of their signature dishes on the menu which is the baked eggs.  I chose to have chicken kebab mixed with the veggies, herbs, parmesan cheese, and eggs in the dish.  it also came with a side of home fries too.  The dish was satisfactory but the 3 baked eggs within the dish were cooked a little unevenly.  One egg was well cooked through with a runny yolk but as you worked your way from right to left, the egg whites/egg became less and less cooked.  It wasn't inedible by any means but it just wasn't consistently cooked.  The chicken kebab was delicious mixed with the herbs and cheese.  Overall, the post GoT episode talk was excellent and the company was great too."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with a couple of friends on Sunday.  Nice little place on church. I got eggs with home fries, toast and  pea meal. Not sure if I will go back.  Food: 2.5/5, my eggs were way too runny for what I usually go for. The pea meal and the fries were good though.  Service: 3/5, not too bad, a lady with Indian type of clothing came by often to check us. It was nice but a bit too much.  Ambience: 2.5/5, little place with nice decor but the seats were quite uncomfortable.  Price: 1.5/5, about $15-20 per person.  They have wrong prices on the menu which is a big problem for me, I got charged more and had to ask why."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on a weekend.  I ordered poached eggs on a english muffin, with no sauce, ham or anything.  It came with the smallest slice of an orange and these terrible hashbrowns/home fries.  The pieces of potato were tiny and seasons horribly.  And then I was billed $12 for the meal!  I couldn't believe it so I complained to the server.  He went to speak to the manager and he expressed that I ordered eggs benedict and that was the price so loudly I could easily hear him.  This place is a joke and is terrible.  A meal that costs them $1 to make costs the customer $12!!!!  I hope they go out of business soon and a half decent breakfast place could come to the village!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Toronto a few weeks ago and decided to have a late lunch. I've been to this place a few years ago & my mom decided to give it a try.  The decor was beautiful and the colorful pillows added a nice touch. Our waitress was very sweet & attentive as well. My mother ordered the spicy tuna omelet and LOVED it as well as the sides that came with it.  I had the Challah French Toast and was quite pleased with it; the plating was really nice as it was adorned with fruit and the French Toast had a nice outer crunch. The side of bacon was a bit undercooked for my liking, but then again I'm not Canadian. Next time I'll specify.  After our meal, the owner came out and introduced himself; he was very friendly and brought us freshly baked chocolate cake. He went on to explain that everything was organic and made fresh to order. We also received cards for 10% off our next visit.  Overall, my mother was completely thrilled with the experience & this is now her favorite Canadian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a colleague as it looked like a cute little restaurant and the menu had lots of potential.    The pillows on the chairs were nice, but it was almost over done as they kept falling on the floor.  The service was friendly, though a bit slow even though we told her we were in a rush.  Then there's the food.  The menu looked promising and I could immediately tell there was an Indian flair as it smelled like samosas (too bad they weren't on the menu though!).  I had the baked eggs with ground beef.  It tasted somewhat weird.  I thought it would be an egg scrambled that was baked, but it was 2 cracked eggs (one yoke was still somewhat runny), some ground beef, cilantro and parmasean cheese on top.  It wasn't really a combination that I would have thought of, but I like to try different things at restaurants and figured they had put some thought into the mixture, but it just tasted so random.  It came with \"HM and toast\".  I asked what HM was and was told that it meant \"homemade\" which didn't really make sense.  Turns out it was (sweet potato) home fries - which were the best part of the meal.    My friend got the creamy crepes.  The waitress couldn't tell us what made them creamy though.  Inside was strawberry, grapes, yoghurt or some sort of whipped cream maybe, and...avocado.  It was the strangest combination.    I don't think it's worth it to try the other enticing looking things on the menu as I suspect they will be just as strange."}
{"text":"I have to give our young female server with I believe an English accent 5 stars for her incredible positivity and customer service. She made the night. Amazing!   We ordered several dishes including the chicken pasta, burger and lamb dish. Reviews angst all were consistent. The food had an appealing aroma but flat on flavour. It was okay but definitely not necessarily dishes I would order again.   Apparently, after 9 maybe, they do not serve coffee. Who does this? It was so peculiar. Unsure if it was a rule they just made for pride weekend or in general. Nothing like this was written on their menu.  During the entire meal, our server was exemplary and honestly, the highlight of the experience. In fact, if it wasn't for her we probably would have left sooner.  I do like supporting this little local spot where the church street diner used to call home.  Perhaps their brunch might be a possibility in the future."}
{"text":"Yeah...something not cool about this place. Difficult to feel comfortable, nothing special about the food. With so many restaurants in Toronto, with this quality of service, this place probably will not survive much longer."}
{"text":"So I went into this bistro because I needed  WIFI and it was pretty cold.  Having entered, the minute I spoke to the person who greeted me, he was incredibly unwelcoming and stand-offish. He seemed to just look at me and become stand-offish for some reason. I wasn't particularly hungry at the time but asked for a beer so I could sit in. I asked him if that was ok and he said yes it's fine.   I'm not sure if it was my accent that he instantly disliked or what (Irish) but I'd been nothing but mannerly, polite and respectful.  He watched me like a hawk the whole time I was there. Felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome. Just glaring at me. I had 2 beers, then walked outside for a cigarette. Despite me leaving my bag/headphones/bottle on the chair to show I was coming back, he ran to the door to check if I was doing a runner and once again, gave me a funny look.  I asked for 1 more bottle before I headed home (I hadn't been drinking previously at all) and he refused me. I was debating getting food but quite frankly I had enough of the dirty looks and being treated like a criminal almost, the whole time I was there. So I left.  I'm not sure what triggered this attitude from him, be it my accent or the fact that I'm young or whatever (I dressed clean and respectively: jeans, brown boots, nice brown leather jacket) but safe to say  I have never been so offended by someone in the food industry in my life. I'm still quite annoyed over it and If I could give it minus stars I really would."}
{"text":"The fish and chips was different from often seen in other places, in a very tasty way. Cozy place and nice service."}
{"text":"I swear by everything holy I have never been to a restaurant with such beautifully prepared dishes. Moreover, each dish exploded with complex flavor.   During brunch, we enjoyed mimosas with fresh squeezed juice and pomegranate champagne.   My wife had the Lobster Benedict and I had Tandoori Benedict (ordered extra spicy).   We finished off with a Chocolate Fondue cake that was to die for."}
