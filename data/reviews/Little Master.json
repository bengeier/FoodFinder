{"text":"The service and environment is so perfect. The beef noodle is really nice:) it's not expensive but taste is good. I super recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience; it might be an ok option for a weekday lunch..., but there are way better options  than this place for lunch"}
{"text":"Ahhh, a delectable new little gem in my hood. Just had the lamb pilaf here and must say the flavors are sublime and portions surreptitiously generous. Service is genuinely friendly and welcoming. I'm generally not a big fan of northern Chinese cuisine, but I'll definitely be back for more of their Northwest Chinese inspired menu for sure. Right now, the place is still new and undiscovered, and although I'd like it to stay that way, I doubt that will happen if their standards hold. An A+ adventure from the Food B for sure...

Venture forth my fellow foodies!"}
{"text":"Cute delicious cozy lunch place to drop by. Decor is very nice and food is hot and has a home cooked feel. Pretty affordable and not extravagant or reserved for the rich.
Their food shoes beauty in the simpler things."}
{"text":"Cute place! Absolutely love their cute logo - which is probably what drawn me into coming here. I ordered pepper beef rice (can't recall the exact name but the egg on it was a nice surprise) and their popcorn chicken! I love their popcorn chicken and would return for that. The rice dish was just okay - the flavours weren't for me. I did see other tables trying their beef noodles and that did look yummier than my dish. I might give that a try next time! There is definitely room for improvement with their service and menu items. It almost seems like their appetizers are better than the mains. I'm hopeful they will sort the kinks out since they are a pretty new establishment. For now, I'm open to giving them another try but not handing recommendations to this place yet."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was walking up Yonge Street north and walked pass Little Master, and then after finding that my preferred Japanese eatery was closed on Sunday I decided to return to Little Master and give it a try. Just like the other Yelps mention, it was the funky signage as well as the name that caught my attention and I guess it was a good thing the other store was closed. It's not very spacious inside but it's also not the smallest, it is just right like Goldilocks kept saying. 
When I go on my own inside new eatery for the time I like it when it's practical empty because it allows me to take good a look around without seeming like I'm intruding on the patron's dining space. 
I already want to try something from here so told the guy who welcomed me that I would order take-out. He gave a menu that looked like a booklet and I sat down and flipped through the pages. There are some tempting dishes on the menu as well as the restaurants own unique features. Also at the back of the menu are the drink features which all looked so refreshing  considering how hot it was that day.
Most of the dishes come with a picture and I wanted to try a few dishes but finally settled on the Braised Pork with Rice and the Beef with Black Bean sauce with Rice. I think it took about 10 to 15 minutes for both orders to be cooked, wrapped and brought back to me, it was quick enough.
Both dishes come accompanied with a fried egg which is a now a common feature among alot of Asian style Rice and Meat parings. I definitely liked the braised pork more and the soy sauce stewed potatoes gave the whole dish a nice taste to it. The beef dish could use more black bean to coat each strip of meat. The amount of rice that placed in each take-out container was a hefty amount and given the reasonable price of about $9 for each dish, it was generous amount.
I'll come back here when I crave for Chinese dishes that are different and I hope Little Masters does well with more customers coming to eat there."}

Pros:
Friendly service
Northern Chinese specialties

Cons:
Not many seats
Menu could use more items

This place used to be the Cha me Cha location in North York.  I walked by many times while they were renovating.  There aren't too many seats at this place.  There are about 3 tables total.  It's more a niche type of place if you ask me.  I'm a little surprised there's only so much seating as the previous business had a lot more seating.

On to the menu.  If you're familiar of Northern Chinese cuisine, you know for he most part it's spicy.  One quick note at the menu will confirm this.  Everything on the menu is spicy to some degree.  While I understood this fact I was still hoping there would be a few non spicy options for my little one.  They couldn't even make the noodles non spicy.  I didn't factor this too much into my rating because like I said, it is the nature of the cuisine.  

We ordered a saute chicken noodle, beef ramen, tofu skewer and Chinese hamburger. My GF enjoyed the saute chicken noodle very much.  She said the portions were just right, not too little, not too much. My beef ramen was pretty good as well.  I liked the noodles and the broth was pretty good.  There was a good amount of veggies which tend to get neglected in these dishes.  The beef though was a little too tough.  I had a nice little battle trying to chew through some of it.

The service here was pretty good.  Everyone was nice and friendly and patient as well.  Overall, I do like this place but because of our little one not being able to tolerate spicy right now, we can't come back until much later. I'm definitely hoping it's still around by then."}
{"text":"Bad service, subpar food, the only thing good about this place is the ambiance with the cute wall design. 

First we seemed to be ignored by the staff and this place isn't big, we were one of 5 tables and 3 were empty. The server seemed more interested with being on his phone rather then the patrons. 

I ordered the lamb paella one of the recommended items. When I first saw it I was like wow they really give you a lot of lamb- mope I got 3 big pieces of fat and knuckle which had absolutely no edible meat on it. It was disgusting. The rice underneath it was ok, had lamb notes with sweet potato. Overall I felt like I was given the parts of the lamb you would buy at spent store to give your dog.

It's a good thing we ordered fried chicken strips as an app as it was really the only thing I was able to eat that was good. This is the only thing saving me from giving it a one star rating.

I had to ask for water multiple times and when I finally got it it was a half full tall glass...  My girlfriend got cold milk tea and it came in a mug, leading me to believe that they are kind of amateurish. 

I won't be returning."}
