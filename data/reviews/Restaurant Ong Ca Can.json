{"text":"This is my first time here.   I was a bit shocked to see the prices on the menu.   I have never seen Vietnamese food priced so expensive before. 

We ordered the bo 7 mon.   Priced at $46!  The highest I have ever seen.   In Toronto,  I saw it priced at $30 and that was the highest I ever saw. 

They served the beef congee first here and it was pretty good.   But a bit short on the beef side.   Than out came the beef fondue.  The raw beef looked cleaned and pretty good as well.   We than had all the bbq beef next.   This place served a beef ball rather than the beef salad.   The other beef rolls were pretty much the same.   I was however a bit disappointed... everywhere I went,  bo 7 mon always had bo lo luc.  This place decided not to make it as one of the seven dishes. Other places will usually vary on the other beef dishes but,  bo lo luc should always be part of it. 

Other than that. .. the food was pretty good.   But the question is. ... will I come again. .. and unfortunately I will have to say no.   The price did not justify the quality. 

The portions were ok. .. not too small and not too much.   But it is just not worth $46.

I'm sorry to say that.   I'm not cheap. . But it's a bit on the expensive side for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since childhood, It was one of the first vietnamese restaurants in MTL, perhaps the first.

The last time I came here was back in the early nineties, it was reminiscent of a bamboo tiki decor back then. I has been renovated since then and it looks much more upscale now.

One of my colleague at work wanted to try vietnamese cuisine, and I thought bringing her to one of those Pho place probably wouldn't do the trick, So naturally I thought of Ong Ca Can and Bo 7 mon.

I believe it is still the only place in MTL that serves Bo 7 mon, which means 7 beef dishes. And at 46$ for two it is well priced, if you want cheaper you have to go to california to get that (try Pagolac).

Traditionally, these themed dishes are served together in a festive setting for special occasions like weddings. As beef is somewhat more expensive than other meats in vietnam, it is generally held in high regard to serve/or be served bo 7 mon. Not to mention it takes a lot of work to make all seven, so it is not often eaten and people are usually excited about these dishes.

1. rice soup with minced beef

2. beef fondue

3. grilled beef wrapped in caul fat

4. grilled beef in Lolot pepper leaves

5. grilled beef wrapped around onions

6. beef steak (vietnamese style)

7. Steamed beef meatloaf with shrimp chips

The beef fondue comes with a side of herbs, lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers and pickled daicon radishes.

Then you also get a half moon bowl of hot water and rice paper. the rice paper is dry and you dip it in the water just to coat it all around with water and then place it flat on your plate. Then you cook the beef in the fondue broth and place it in the rice wrapper along with all the herbs lettuce and whatever else you want. then you make a roll and then dip it in the sauce and eat.

The sauce is made with fermented anchovies and pineapple puree. Don't worry it doesn't smell that much they have toned it down here, it is very nicely done.

For items 3-5 you can also roll in the rice wrapper and dip in the sauce.

The steak you just eat it, it is sliced thinner than regular steak, and it is a small piece and it is done medium, but slightly charbroiled on the outside.

The meat loaf comes at the end, you get a half moon portion served with shrimp chip.

My coworkers were very impressed with the multi course meal. It did alter their perception that viet food was Pho and little else. It was a cultural experience for them which was very profound and I'm glad to be their guide.

Don't worry if you order this and you don't have a guide with you , the waiters will show you how it's done. I know everyone has had Pho before, want to rediscover vietnamese food? come here, order Bo 7 Mon... you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful and biggest Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal! Their decor is tasteful and modern, and if you have a large party, ask to be seated in the mezzanine upstairs where you're offered some modicum of privacy.
Our party had the beef 7 ways (2 people per order, but priced individually). The best part about eating beef 7 ways is making your own food! You get a salad, a congee, a beef cooked in vinegar fondue (you cook your own beef), and 4 types of grilled beef. A side of noodles, a basket filled with fresh herbs and lettuce, tray of rice paper, and a bowl of warm water are provided for you to make your own beef fondue and grilled beef spring rolls. Dip these rolls in either fish sauce or mam nem (a pungent shrimp sauce mixed with minced garlic, lemongrass,  pineapple, and fresh squeezed lime sauce)- I recommend the mam nem, with plenty of crushed pepper garlic hot sauce, and slowly savor the fruit of your labor. Pair with green tea (served in a pot, priced per person). End with a fried bananas dessert. 
We loved our food and tea. And the table next to us ordered grilled shrimp on sugarcane and said their food was great. So if you go there and had 3-4 persons, I suggest getting the beef 7 ways and an order of grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"Ong Ca Can is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant. Soups and all entrées I have tried so far are awesome. A must try restaurant if you happen to be in Montréal. There is another Vietnamese restaurant next door so please read the restaurant name carefully."}
{"text":"First off,this isn't an authentic Vietnamese restaurant despite its name.   The food is a hybrid of Chinese, Thai, Viet, and other Asian influences.  The decor is nicer than a typical Asian restaurant but don't expect the complex layers of flavor that accompany a Vietnamese traditional restaurant.   

We ordered the prix fix meal for 2 and for 48 CAD it wasn't a bad deal.   The 8 ingredient soup was good with shrimp beef and chicken.  Almost like an egg drop soup with more meat.   

The rest of the meal was good but the peanut chicken was odd. It came with fried spinach and a fake Thai sauce.  Definitely not Viet. 


Overall if you want a nice decor and ambience, this is the place.  if you want traditional Vietnamese, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bon, le resto en soit est pas mal jolie, propre et l'accueil y est cordial.

Nous ne savions vraiment pas quoi prendre et notre serveur nous a conseillé le repas de 3 viandes où nous faisons nous-mêmes nos rouleaux de printemps. Ils apportent un plateau avec les feuilles de riz, un plateau avec les choix de viandes et un saladier avec carottes, concombres, fèves germées, coriandre, mentre et laitue.

Faire soi-même nos rouleaux de printemps était une genre de fausse bonne idée! C'est clairement plus facile lorsqu'ils arrivent déjà fait devant nous haha 

Bref, c'était une expérience intéressante et  agréable. La viande était très bonne et les ingrédients étaient frais. 

Les prix sont raisonnables pour le centre-ville. 
Un resto asiatique à essayer sur Ste-Catherine :)"}
{"text":"Oooh la la ... fantastique!!!

Heard from the locals that this is THE place to go for Bo 7 Mon (7 Beef Dishes) and they were all right!

My husband, my aunt, my mom, and I all agree that this is the best place for Bo 7 Mon.  We've never experienced better restaurant grade Bo 7 Mon ... ever!!!!

All the beef dishes were flavourful and tender; and prepared in quite a refined way.  

A lot of veggies - lettuce, mint, basil, carrots, pickled daikon radish, cucumber, other leaf herbs I don't know the name of - are included but there is the option of ordering extra (for a charge) if you run out.  

The rice paper was amazing ... thin and never tore?!  I want to know the brand of that rice paper!!!!

One of the highlights of the meal was the dipping sauce ... OMG ... it is a shrimp/ anchovy based sauce called mam nem.  It is probably the best mam nem I've ever tried.  It was little spicy and just perfect ... with bits of crushed pineapple ... oh YUM!!!!!  

No vermicelli noodles were included - that would be extra if you so require.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous - not your stereotypical Vietnamese restaurant (sorry stereotypical Vietnamese restaurants).  High loft like ceilings, dark wood, modern decor, glass ... beautiful!  There was definitely an upscale vibe.  

Cost of the Bo 7 Mon is $42/ 2 people.  

I wasn't stuffed silly but left pleasantly satisfied.

p.s. - No Highchairs

p.p.s - Located right beside a tattoo heavy, piercing heavy, gothish bar

p.p.p.s - Right across the street is a male strip club and a place to buy Beaver Tail."}
{"text":"The best vietnamese food in town! I'm surprised some reviews says that the food is not authentic. This restaurant is at authentic as it gets! 

Try the \"Bo Bay Mon\" (7 course beef). You will not be disappointed! It's 45$ for 2 people and you will not be dissapointed! They have a wine list, not extensive (but very good for a vietnamese restaurant). Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine will cost around 130$ (Tip included). 

I also enjoy their Cha Gio & Banh Tom! We are regulars and happy to see that there's a lot of Vietnamese who visits this restaurant! Keep up the good work Tien & Hang!"}
{"text":"One of the first Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal. I have been going there for nearly 30 years. Home of my favorites \"imperial rolls\" anywhere"}
{"text":"Une beau restaurant vietnamien avec un environment détendu. Je vous recommande de prendre le Service de buf cuit de cette façon pour 2.  Je suis allé un samedi soir - soirée jazz"}
{"text":"If you are Vietnamese or appreciate Vietnamese food, and are looking for Bo Bay Mon (7 Courses of Beef), this is the best place in the Montreal Metro area to get it. 

It may not be as good as Westminster's Little Saigon or San Jose, but for Montreal, it is the best. This on recommendation of the Vietnamese locals.

If you like Beef and Vietnamese food, this is the choice for you. If you have never had this 7 course meal wich is becoming very popular on the West Coast of the US, check it out, or bring  a Viet friend to show you the ropes on how to eat each course."}
{"text":"Pretty good cross over Asian food, not necessarily Vietnamese. Love the outdoor deck. Staff is pretty friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"As an Asian, it was quite disappointing to see the restaurant should have served sushi with vietnamese dishes... It's cuturally incorrect.

Unlike the comments before, they no longer serve traditional vietnamese dishes. 

We have tried a soup and 2 lunch sets on the menu. They seemed not bad to us, but there wasn't any specialties...

Given the same materials, we could have cooked better.

Really. Don't understand why there are so many French people here..."}
