{"text":"I've gone to this place about 5 times. It's located in J-Town. I like this izakaya as you can actually have a conversation (as opposed to the others such as Guu where you can barely hold a conversation without shouting) and aren't told you have a time limit as soon as you are seated at a table (like Guu - I find this so irritating and tacky). The service is friendly and attentive. We typically order some sashimi and sushi maki rolls - they are always fresh. The chicken yakitori, beef, and pork skewers are delicious - love the charcoal grilled taste. Their prices are fair - individual dishes are typically below $15 and the skewers are on average around $2-$3. You can easily keep ordering without thinking about the dollars adding up. For the two of us, we typically spend around $120 each time (with one alcohol drink). Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Don't Go!
I get used to be their faithful customer, but today i visite again, i have found they have a big change. Food taste and portion are not as good as before, neither to their service.....
The uni sashimi order only hv 4 tiny tiny pieces and it doesn't worth $18 dollars per order. As to the skewers, they are not that salty before but it's extremely salty tdy..... not only this, it's taste bitter also
And the older server before i prefer better as they does make sense...
i will not go anymore, as i can have better food and service with the same price"}
{"text":"Sashimi was the highlight (shrimp, scallop etc.).
The popular item 'tepa-gyoza' (i could've misspelled it) was not that impressive tho.. 
Compared to the other izakayas, the portion was not bad (especially for the meat items, such as beef tongue or pork cheek).

In general, my friend and I enjoyed the food and experience. It was also not as loud as Guu per say, but the tables are close enough that you can hear what the people beside you."}
{"text":"Really good Japanese Izakaya. Prices are very reasonable and service is quick. Nice to have a good option like this uptown. Good variety as well. We always get the bbq meats on a stick. Yakatori I think it's called."}
{"text":"A well-decorated and non-rowdy izakaya in J-Town. We didn't have alcohol, but they seemed to have an interesting drink selection, including quite a few cocktails, and great food to go with it.

The Osaka cha han was really popular with our group. I also liked the roasted green tea pudding and my father liked the oyster and the stuffed chicken wings. 

There is also a big selection of 'drinking food' available like deep fried chicken cartilage, skewers, takoyaki, tofu and edamame.

As others have mentioned, the price could easily add up, so I'd definitely have a budget going in."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to Izakaya Ju after it expanded and took over the ramen place next door (which was a good idea because they seem to be busy all the time!). The bigger space definitely makes the eating experience much more comfortable. 

Everything we ordered were delicious: deep fried chicken soft bones, Osaka fried rice with octopus, chicken burger, gyoza stuffed chicken wings and vinegar grilled mackerel. Although all these dishes were great, our favourite ended up being the dessert - roasted green tea pudding. So smooth and creamy!"}
{"text":"3.5

It is a small restaurant..  I recommend that you make reservations before you go. When I went on Saturday evening, the restaurant was packed. 

Service was average. Don't expect similar atmosphere as Guu Izakaya - the restaurant was pretty quiet which I enjoyed. The menu doesn't offer many choices but they're at affordable price. I tried Takoyaki, fried rice with octopus, tofu, grilled chicken skin .. I liked their Takoyaki; the sauce was just perfect and it was slightly crispy. 

No 4 or 5 because I didn't find anything special about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ever since Izakaya has been a trend in DT Toronto, it stretched out to North Toronto along the Yonge street. Izakaya Ju is located at the end of the North Toronto in J-Town. It offers casual Japanese dishes, and they are not ordinary dishes other Izakaya offers. They change their special menus over some time, so there's more variety to its menu.

Food:
- I've been to Ju three times, and all three times, I ordered Teba (Chicken wings) & Negima (Chicken leg & leeks) Yakitories and Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with pork dumplings. Most of yakitories are salted and grilled, and sometimes it can be really salty. Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with pork dumplings are very different, something that you won't see in traditional sushi restaurants. It has full flavor of pork dumplings with tender chicken. Seared BC Tuna tastes good with raw onions, but disappointingly, it's thick and awkwardly sliced. Agedashi Mochi has very interesting texture, and the bonito soup with it is very original and natural. They currently have Osaka fried rice with octopus for special menu. It may look like ordinary fried rice from Chinese take outs. But with sliced gari, bonito flakes, and okonomiyaki sauce on top, it has unique flavour of Osaka. Overall, most of foods are good, but salty enough that saltiness in your mouth won't easily go away.

Service:
- Staffs are very friendly, and attentive. But there were lack of communication with few waitresses when making reservation, and ordering. It was hard to talk to them on the phone, because they did not get my name easily that I had to repeat and spell it out few times. Also, our waitress misunderstood our order and we had to wait an hour for one udon to come out. Other than that, there is no problem with staffs.

Atmosphere:
- It's crowded both weekdays' and weekends' dinner. For party of 4 or more, I recommend making reservations before visiting. There's nothing special about interior, and since the restaurant is filled with smoke all the time with grilling yakitori, it is best not to wear expensive winter clothings when visiting. 

If you are looking for a place to drink Japanese beer with yakitories and little snacks in North Toronto, Izakaya Ju is the perfect place to pay a visit."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with the food.  

It was ok, but I would not go back again.  Spending that kind of money, i would rather go downtown to another Izakaya"}
{"text":"Great for lunch.

Not so sure about dinner as I never been for.

More pricey than run of the mill Japanese place but better quality."}
{"text":"Awesome taste! The grilled selection is tasty, so do other good such as sashimi, japanese beef and ochatsuke, etc. The price is not cheap, but worthy."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced 
At 5:35pm,I called the restaurant to make reservations for party of 5 . The lady said they don't take reservations anymore but there is a few table available,so come by 6 when they open for dinner. I double checked with her there will be a table for us before making the trip and she said yes
When we got there, this guy said there isn't any table available,I explained the conversation I've earlier and he still hesitate to seat us. So later according to him,we can have the table for an hour only.we finally set done to check out the menu,he comes again and said last call for food is 7 and we definitely have to leave by an hour. We figured by the time we order and the food to arrive, we basically have less than half an hour to eat. Feeling the rudeness in the service and pressure,we decide to leave. This guy looks \"happy\" that we decide to leave, no apologies of the inconvenience they caused. If on the phone conversation the lady had told me about the 1 hour eating time, I would not make a trip for it.
Don't even want to give 1 star, but if I don't  rate, this will not be posted"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Every time I visit the GTA, I always try to make it here. It is small and cozy and the food is amazing. I always like to come with a group of 4 or more so we can order more and try everything. My favourite is the Ja Ja Men, and the dumpling Chicken Wings. SO GOOD! The staff are also very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is so good!   I keep returning time after time and they have yet to disappoint.  They offer a nice selection of items to choose from and prices are reasonable.  My favorite is probably the black cod but anything from the grill (beef tongue, pork cheek) is a close second.
Getting hungry just writing this review! ;)"}
{"text":"Went here once and felt like it's pretty pricy. The portions weren't that big but really liked the food!"}
{"text":"This is the first Izakaya that I've ever been too.  I've been coming here for years now and they've been amazing every time.  It's the place I bring my friends to if there is a celebration.

I don't drink Sake but I do enjoy the food here.  I come specifically for the yakitori.  They cook the food over a charcoal grill.  You can see one of the chefs there cooking over a small grill and constantly fanning the food.

I haven't tried Guu yet, so not sure if this is the best in Toronto or not.

If you didn't make reservations and the place is packed, head next door to Niwatei or Shiso Tree."}
{"text":"Get the osaka cha han on the lunch menu. Comes with a miso soup. It's so delicious I have dreams about it. The food is good, the service is great! They always greet you and see you off in japanese, it's a nice touch they've added. The kitchen is very open so all the scents waft out into the dining room and it's great for lunch if you work in the area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After using Yelp to find an Izakaya restaurant in the Scarborough/Markham area, this place was one of the top ones that popped up. After coming here, I can see why it is one of the top Izakaya restaurants in the area.

We ordered quite a few dishes so here are a few highlights:

- Baby Octopus with Wasabi: Very good dish and you can really taste the wasabi. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who isn't used to wasabi. One of my favourite dishes here
- Yakitori: We had the Yakitori Don, chicken hearts, pork belly, and the gizzards.The Yakitori Don was good, but I have to say that the Chicken Hearts stood out for me. Flavourful and juicy.
- Teriyaki Burger: Ordered this based on a few other reviews, but was slightly disappointed. It may have been a case of not being able to live up to the hype, but I found it a bit too salty for my taste. Still a very interesting take on a burger.
- Pork Belly with Spicy Sauce: This dish had good flavour, but the Pork Belly may have been overcooked. When I think of pork belly, I expect it to be very soft and fatty. But overall, the sauce makes up for this.

Those were the more noteworthy dishes we had and I would recommend Izakaya Ju for those looking for their Izakaya fix in the Scarborough/Markham area."}
{"text":"My go to place north of Toronto for J pubs. When the DVP closes, this is king! This is my first time back since the expansion and reno. The place looks great. Lots of room and not as tight as before. Very comfortable. The food remains just as good with new additions. Horse meat. Yum! Pudding. Mmm..."}
{"text":"The service is really good. The waitresses are pretty, too. Food are good. I love their sushi, fried rice and chicken wing."}
{"text":"Go for Dark interior ambience and somewhat Tasty dishes.  But, make sure you bring $80-120/p. Because portion sizes are terribly hideously small eg. 3 Veggie dishes 1 carrot 2 eggplant 3 cucumber[all had 4-6 thumb nail size slices] 4 chicken dish [ 6 tiny bitesized bbq  squires thumb nail size as well.  A noodle soup concoction mostly all noodles 1 huge piece of ice berg lettuce and 3-5 pathetic pieces of chicken.  You be the judge and do you uinderstand what I am reporting. Left the place famished & ordered a burger and fries and subway sandwich. Bought some steamed Chinese chicken to take home because it was a cold hungry night out at that resto. Never again ever in my lifetime!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was great since we really enjoy snacking on a wide variety of selection!"}
{"text":"Eating at the soft open right now... renovated so it's bigger. Truly the yakitori here is absolutely amazing. Has that taste that you can only get from a charcoal grill.

The gindara daikon was done just right. The fish was soft, flavourful and moist; the Damon had soaked up the base and was just wonderful.

Have been here before and would continue going."}
{"text":"If you are looking for real, authentic Japanese food you need to give this place a try.  The sashimi is so fresh and melts in your mouth. Other items you must try. Black cod, Curry, Chicken Karaage, Chilli Shrimp, Oden... Service is amazing. Servers are very quick and polite. Prices are very reasonable.  You get what you pay for. It's not a knock off, it's the real thing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. I love the grilled sweet yam, it is delicious, will try that at home"}
{"text":"Great Octopus on fried rice! Very friendly staff. Will definitely bring my wife here!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not get the chance to try their famous yakitori, so I can't say if those make this place worth a visit. The sushi here was fairly good but certainly not mind-blowing. Prices are on the higher side, though I personally felt that the ambience and the service level balanced it out. I would highly recommend the restaurant as a meeting place, since it was relatively quiet during lunch (or at least not super hectic) and the whole experience (from calling for reservations to menu ordering to the promptness of tea refills) was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"One-Star Rating = WALK OUT.

One of my friends told me that a new izakaya place opened up in North York in the J-town shopping complex.

I heard they had decent yakitori and I decided to check it out with my mom and siblings.  

I know most new restaurants need some time to work out the kinks... but this place needs an extreme makeover... and fast.

When you first walk in, the staff greets you in Japanese...in a half-ass manner that screams I do this because they make me.

The first thing you notice is that the restaurant is hot.  Uncomfortably menopausal hot-flash hot (not that I actually know what that feels like, but I assume it sucks).

The decor is not all that exciting...dull and I don't get the gray stones stuck on the wall.

The hostess/waitress seats us and the leaves the menus on the table and walks away without saying a word.  Actually, I didn't even know they were rolled up menus in bamboo.

The (lunch) menu is about 9 items...bento box style set meals.
The second page was drinks.

I glanced around to see what everyone else was eating..  The salmon was popular served with... a plain bowl of white rice.  It looked pretty unimpressive.

We were already seated and we were willing to give the place a try...
Even though I could see the disappointed faces of my family members that the menu was so small.

We waited a damned LONG time without any type of service.
I told my family we should leave.
We got up.... The staff said their Japanese goodbye, not even realizing we were walking out.  Well, the hostess noticed but well at that point I was out the door and looking furious.

The ONLY good thing that came out of this experience was exploring the J-town center.  It's tiny, but across from Izakaya-Ju-Shouldn't-Waste-Your-Time-Here is a self-serve cafeteria with all kinds of wonderful snack-time treats!!!

Note: Dinner may be different, I went for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is good for a casual and easy meal, but don't expect spectacular food. While most items are cooked well, this restaurant relies too much on mayo, soy sauce and other savory sauces to give flavor to the food. So everything kind of ends up tasting the same. There are some unusual items on the menu for the more adventurous eaters. Prices are mostly reasonable. And most items are great for sharing.  

Sunagimo (Gizzard) $2.5: decent, has a bite to it 

Deep fried chicken wing stuffed with pork $7.5 - It was too salty and soggy with the sauce. The combination was odd. 

Osaka style fried rice with octopus $8 - It had the right amount of seasoning, but I barely noticed the octopus.  

Octopus balls $5 - This is my favorite as the dough is soft and tasty. Great texture. 

BBQ pork belly with spicy sauce $5 - REALLY DRY. Not what I expected with pork belly. It is also overwhelmingly sweet with no spice anywhere. 

Deep fried chicken knuckles $5? - Great crunch. I would recommend it if you like foods with crunchy texture, but I prefer actual pieces of meat. 

Also don't expect great service. My water glass was never refilled and the server completely forgot about my table."}
{"text":"We were having a birthday party at  Izakaya, and the services that we received were great. Their waiters are nice and always wearing a smile.

Food is good, I would recommend the mango sushi, it is a really nice combination.

Friend pre-ordered having fresh fish a day before and it was an overall great experience. After having the fresh fish, they will prepare fish congee for you as well. 

Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"My all-time favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto! Wide variety of yakitori selection, good lunch specials and great drink selection. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the most authentic ramen I've had since living in Japan and only around $10! All other prices are a little high, but the quality of the ingredients are worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for dinner and had a good time. The staff was so incredibly kind and helpful, they're 50% of why I would come back to Ju to eat again. I'm as indecisive as they come so I couldn't settle on what to order. We asked our waiter for suggestions and we were really satisfied with what he advised us to order. Plus, they were always refilling our tea (roasted rice tea, one of my favourites!) which I really appreciated 'cause I tend to guzzle my water at meals awfully fast. A+++ for service!

Takoyaki ($5): This was nice to start off our meal with, there were two skewers with three takoyaki balls each. It was nice and gooey in the centre, and both my boyfriend and I enjoyed it a lot. 

Teba Gyoza ($8.50): Our waiter recommended this as his personal favourite dish. It's basically chicken wings stuffed with a meat filling you would find in dumplings. So essentially it's like a chicken wing dumpling! The chicken was SO juicy and tender while the skin was perfectly crispy, and the meat filling was really flavourful. One order has three wings, my boyfriend wasn't a huge fan but I'm glad 'cause I got two wings for myself. 

Osaka Cha Han ($9): The waiter also suggested this dish, saying it was popular among customers. It's like fried rice with little octopus bits throughout. My boyfriend didn't taste/notice any octopus bits at all but they were there, just quite sparse. I didn't think it was all that special but my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He's already planning on going back just to eat this again. It's really filling as well, it doesn't look that big but it stuffed both of us.


Overall, I would dine at Ju again! It wasn't phenomenal (only because I'm one of those AYCE sushi fanatics and less of a small Japanese dish dining fan) but it was still a really enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"?? Combo (Grilled chicken Combo)
It comes with 5 kabobs of different kinds of chicken, such as chicken balls, wings, soft bones, livers and meat with leeks etc. They taste on the salty side but they go so well with the  beer.

Black Cod
The fish is so sweet though not much seasoning is added. This is a wonderful plain dish and yet tastes awesome!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad J-Town finally opened up some restaurants in the area. I frequented this restaurant with my aunt and loved the authentic Japanese food. The concept of an Izakaya is almost one of a Trattoria for Italians and this place is no exception. The food is exceptional.

I have been here for lunch and dinners and the atmosphere is really one of a Diner Dash game with one or two waitresses serving guests and a few cooks in the open kitchen. Izakaya Ju does not feature your typical Spider and California rolls, but rather, tapas items such as Tongue, Pork Cheek, Conch, Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Gindara slice, and BC Tuna. All the dishes are meant to be shared. My ALL TIME FAVE lunch dish is the Beef Curry with rice which is delish, filling and not expensive.

I was here for dinner and arrived at 8:30pm and the place was packed. We were lucky that one table just finished making room for us. In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant features specials written on the chalk board. I suggest you to try the stuff on the board. The food here is so good and fresh.

For tonight, I ordered a 720ml bottle of sake which comes in at $75 as the cheapest 720ml option. There is some black bottle at $150...in other words, sake is not cheap here. That being said, we ordered the sake of a \"1000 Long Lives\" and it was the hardest, heavenliest, sake I have ever tried. Well worth the $75 bucks.

FYI! When you order the chicken balls, look for the dedicated cook who is responsible for fanning the fire to make the chicken tender and juicy (in order to have that great BBQ taste).

All in all, I love this restaurant. There is another restaurant beside that has a mostly ramen/noodle menu so depending on what you fee like, you will not be disappointed. The place is small, but service is very homely and the food is so, SO, very good."}
{"text":"Restaurant space is tiny - as expected of all the places in J-town.  I found that when it's busy I'd rather sit at the counter and watch them grill my food, but that's just me.  There aren't any decent izakaya places uptown so this is a great place close to home.  This place is definitely not children-friendly - there is simply not enough space and the tables are too close together.

I've been here a few times and each time ask the waitresses for recommendations (in case I've missed anything new on the menu).  So far they've suggested different items each time.  The dumpling-stuffed chicken wing seems like a novelty thing to try, but I'd have to say that was the least impressive of the items I ordered.  Definitely try out their grill skewers, but I also enjoyed the squid sashimi too.  I usually order the squid rice just to fill up in case all the little dishes don't do it for me, but in the end I'm usually more than full.

I'd say the menu is definitely small.  While I still enjoy most of the dishes available, it would be nice to see more additions or variations of what they have."}
{"text":"The food there was so-so, it was actually quite bad comparing to other places that I've tried like Guu. I feel that their food doesn't even taste good so it's not worth the price that I've paid for. I went with my boyfriend yesterday. The service was not that great, when we got seated the waitress asked us what drinks we want. Then she came over 4 times within the 5-6 mins that we are trying to look for what to eat and it seems like she was rushing us. In the end we paid our bills which was 30 dollars and we paid $40 asking for the change, but they never gave us back our change. We waited for 20 mins sitting there and the waitresses were all staring at us waiting for us to leave so in the end we just left. It was a pretty bad experience so I would not go back again. 

The place is also very small, so we were lucky that we got there earlier and got seats because we saw people waiting for a long time for their seat."}
{"text":"Great place for unique and authentic Japanese cuisine. They offer a wide variety of izakaya, sushi and sashimi products. They're cocktail and sake choices are also quite good. 

Do expect your bill to be bigger than you expect, you get what you pay for; good food for higher price. They have seasonal items like horse meat tartar (picture uploaded) and other unique items. They serve dishes in small portions like tapas unless you order rice and noodles etc.

ALCOHOL : Only half of their restaurant has liquor license because they expanded afterwards when they took over the ramen place next door. SO, if you want to drink any alcohol i you can only order (for now) when you are seated on the side with the chefs (right side) until they get their license for the other side. 

Overall good place for good authentic Japanese food. I'd come back. Check out the pictures I uploaded to help."}
{"text":"Yakitori is OK, beef sashimi less than stellar. Out of 3 menu items of the 6 we ordered. When asked to sample some sake before buying a $90 bottle we were refused. Although prices were reasonable and sashimi was of good the poor quality of service, run down ambiance, and lack of management weighs heavily on this joint."}
{"text":"UPDATE:
I gotta give them the full 5 Stars!
Been there 3 times in the last 6 weeks and not once have I been dissappointed. Plus, everyone I took there says this place will definitely be a regular visit.
Called for reservations and they were able to accommodate my whole family for Father's Day lunch (7 adults and 3 kids), food was great, service was all smiles and quick.
***** Loving this place!


My first time at Izakaya Ju and it's a little too early to give them the full 5 stars... so they're getting 4.5!

Just like everything in J-town, it's a small space but they could handle a big group (12-15ppl, keeping this place in mind to take my whole family) and still have space for more diners without being squished or bumped around.  Staff greets you when you arrive or leave, but not as loud as they would at Guu. Service was quick and always with a smile.

I dined with a 2 friends for lunch.  We shared:
- Beef tongue soy sauce and mustard
soft meat and good flavour
- Grilled mackarel
I like mackarel, my friends not so much... more for me ;)
- Octopus balls (takoyaki)
Loved it! They are on the small side, but great flavour and they're loaded with octopus.
- Beef garlic fried rice
Mmmm... my only problem was I had to eat it with chopsticks!
- Pork cheek yakitori
O so tender and just seasoned with salt... Yumm!
- Chicken leg yakitori, sauce
Nice juicy dark meat
- Cod yakitori
Totally different flavour from the strong mackarel, but still good.
- Leg and leek yakitori, sauce
Nice and soft, the leek enhances the flavour
- Pork belly yakitori, sauce
It's pork and belly... can't go wrong with that =D
- Tsukune, sauce
ground chicken ball, always curious how they make it and it tastes good
They give you a choice to either have your yakitori salted or sauced.

Bill came up to $85 including tax and 20% tip which is very reasonable.
Everything we ate was soo good! Just writing about it makes my mouth water.

I need to go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Their lunches are great! My mother and I came for a lunch since we didn't want to go to Shiso, and we were quite impressed. We ordered beef tongue, chicken hearts, and roast duck just to try it. 

The beef was tender and flavourful with a nice, almost fatty texture, while the chicken hearts had the right amount of springiness and no bad aftertaste from cheap product. The duck was pretty good too, but the meat wasn't quite as juicy as I wanted it to be. 

My mother had a Mackerel set which came with a huge chunk of grilled fish. It was meaty and not tough at all. the portion was very large, and it was very affordable (I think it was $10 or $12). 

I ordered the Sushi Set ($17), not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw chutoro on my plate along with real wasabi. I go to many of the top Japanese restaurants in the city, such as Zen, Yasu, and Shoushin. While Ju isn't quite as good as those, their fish quality seems comparable to the likes of Aoyama! 

There was also a really expensive unagidon ($30). We were curious as to why it was so expensive, so we ordered a couple pieces of unagi sushi ($3.50 per piece). It turned out to be a great decision! It was obvious prepared with a lot of TLC because the sauce had this nice sticky sweetness to it, and the flesh almost melted away in your mouth. Nothing like the eel you get at all you can eat places; the meat just gives way to a grand flavour experience. 

Dunno about dinner prices, but lunch is definitely worth it! Service is friendly, food comes out fairly quick (unlike Shiso) and they're definitely putting out some quality items."}
{"text":"Never noticed this restaurant in J Town before as it is near the end of the entrance. We went for dinner around 8pm with no reservations. It's a nice restaurant, not too loud or quiet - we could have conversation without raising our voice.

We ordered Hotate sushi, baked oysters with mayo, octopus with seaweed, takoyaki balls, chicken balls, chicken wings, stuffed chicken wings and chicken karage (he decided to go all out on chicken) for our meal. I didn't find any of their chicken dishes that great (maybe because it's just chicken?) but I really enjoyed the octopus with seaweed - it has a strong wasabi flavour but not too overwhelming. Everything else we ordered was just \"nothing special\".

For drinks, I started off with the Yuzu sake (my all time favourite sake) which they serve over ice - other places serve it chilled so no ice required as it dilutes the drink. Then we moved on to Asahi Black. Finally, we finished the meal with a roasted green tea pudding - it was nice but tasted like melted green tea ice cream with gelatin. 

Overall, I didn't particularly enjoyed the food maybe because we ordered the wrong things. I would go back for the octopus and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome izakaya! It's a small place tucked away in the back of J-town but very cozy and is true to the modern izakaya feel. Grilled selection is excellent and tastey, cannot pass up over some Asahi Black beer (which I don't see offered often so it's a real treat for me).

Prices are not over the top but not cheap either. But hey, you are paying for someone to manually charcoal grill your meats to perfection. It's worth it. 

Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Coolest menu."}
{"text":"salty ramen, can't even take another bite. Foods are not proper seasoned. Don't let \" Japanese\" food attract you here. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here around 5-6 times lunch and dinner.  I like this restaurant overall as it is one of the few izakayas around Markham.  The menu is pretty special, stuff you won't find in all those typical sushi places.  You won't find california rolls here.

For lunch all their offerings are good, notibles are Gyu don, beef curry and the ja ja noodle.  My fav is the beef curry, a dish i will go back on.  The beef curry is not the traditional japanese beef curry, is ground beef mixed in with the curry.

For dinner, this is like a snacking place. You need to get a few dishes to make you full, and this is what Izakaya is all about, variety. Luckly most of the stuff is very  good quality. The yakatori (chicken skewers) are very good, they use coal.  The Osaka rice is one of my favorites.  There are other dishes that will scare you like the raw baby squid but the taste is very authentic.  The mackerel was very good as well. Tasted very fresh. 

This is why i come back many times.

What is preventing it from getting 5 star is the menu is not too diverse and hardly ever changes, and this is what seperates this place from a place like Guu Izakaya (downtown)."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and have enjoyed my meals both times!

I've tried the chirashi don, which is pricey at $35. However, the quality of fish along with the types they give you make it more worthwhile. Just coming back from a trip to Japan a few months ago, I would say the fish quality was at a similar level.

The ramen with pork is really good, the broth is tasty and the ramen itself is just the right texture! Again, on par quality with what I had in Japan!

I also had the chicken wings (I believe its 3 for $7?) which were huge and tasty! I actually ordered them because I saw that a lot of people in the restaurant had ordered it, and I'm glad that I did! The outside is crispy, the inside is moist and the sauce is tasty and not too sweet or salty. 

They have an assortment of skewers you can order as well, and we opted for the 5-skewer assortment set that is picked by the chef for $12. Each one was good, there was none that I didn't like.

Definitely going to be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Their pork meatball stuffed chicken wings are a must!  The beef tongue is also very good.  Unfortunately the place is small so it fills up pretty quickly.  If you want to get a seat at lunch, arrive early!

We brought our two small children and they had enough room and high chairs for us but it is tight so be ready"}
{"text":"This Izakaya was authentic. Staff is Japanese and polite. Very cozy restaurant, does not seat too many people. We ordered teba gyoza, which was chicken wings awesomely stuffed with pork. Tasty. Also ordered Osaka cha Han, fried rice with octopus. It is unique with their house sauce. Takoyaki balls were decent. They should consider expanding."}
{"text":"I forgot to write a review but we came here about 4 months ago. I came here with my boyfriend. I went on yelp to see what restaurants are around my area. We decided to try it out. The place is a hidden gem!! Everything we ordered was so good!! The wings, sushi and especially the fried octopus rice! The service was good too. One thing is that it was a little difficult to find since the signage isn't visible since it was dark and night time. I dont usually write reviews however I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"More like a 4.5, I reallllllly love this place. It's not fair to compare this Izakaya to places like Guu though, cause it has more of a laid back quiet vibe to it. So for haters of Guu who can't stand being yelled at as they enter & leave, this is the place for you. I also find that it's easier to get a more filling meal here. My bf and I ordered the:
 osaka style fried rice (awesomeness)
 yakitori combo (much better deal than ordering it individually, large portions per skewer and very yummy
 sake mussels (good sized mussels, avg quality, good for winter cause there's broth)
spicy pork belly (not spicy at all. still good, cause its pork belly)
 and the meat stuffed chicken wings (come on. its meat stuffed in a wing then fried. no one can mess that up! part of yakitori combo I believe)
Overall I really enjoyed my time here and I regret not trying the burgers that everyone talks about! Will surely return to try more from the menu.

**sidenote: servers here also seem to have better english here than guu for anyone who cares."}
{"text":"The menu was very small and therefore didn't contain much variety. However, some of their dishes are interesting in that they aren't standard for every sushi restaurant out there in Toronto. 

Overall the experience was okay. The food was decent, but nothing spoke highly to me. Wouldn't really come here or recommend."}
{"text":"My new favourite place.  I've been here several times now.  This time I tried just about every grilled item and wasn't disappointed.  I didn't like the soft bone as much as my wife did.  The pork cheeks were awesome.  I also had Zaru soba which was good.  I wish they had a few more selections on their grill selection."}
{"text":"There sign says they close at 11pm and last call was 10:45pm. I was annoyed to arrive just before 10pm and for them to say they were closed. It's not a good for business. :/"}
{"text":"I actually like this Izakaya in comparison to the other ones. The place is small though, which wasn't to my liking, but I didn't have to wait for long, so that was good. I had the Osaka styled fried rice with octopus, while my friends had Uni & Ikura Don, Yakitori Don, Sashimi sets. 

Other than the Yakitori Don, I wasn't a fan of the others my friends had. I did really like my own dish though. Extremely flavorful with hints of authenticity. It's something that I never had, considering how often my friends enjoy going to sushi buffets - so the only thing that ever comes to mind when someone mentions japanese cuisine is sushi and miso soup. The quality of the ingredients are really good though. Of course, you can't really compare to the cities that serve fresh-fresh seafood. But for japanese cuisine in Toronto, this place is satisfactory. For some reason I don't recall paying too much at Ju in comparison to the one located on Eglington."}
{"text":"I think an update is due as I finally got around to trying the dinner service here. I cherish my visits to this plaza as my fav grocery store is located here. Alas most of my trips are during daytime and few and far between (maybe that ought to change) and with the groceries loaded up I just grabbed a quick lunch on my last visit here. This was a planned visit so I took my time this visit. 
What I like about this plaza is if you don't sell authentic Japanese food you won't last here as it is frequented by people who know what Japanese food is supposed/ought to be. I came here to try their grilled items specifically as luv binchotan charcoaled stuff. I ordered the takoyaki as its on of the best in the city IMO. The Unaju looked tempting so had to order it. For good measure also added an order of Wagyu skewers. They have an OK beer and sake list which is worth a look. The takoyaki is still its old self i.e. great. The Wagyu is decent though I think I will order the mix skewer combo next visit. Now for Uanju oh boy where do I start I enjoy Uangi to an extent that I can devour a whole eel (frozen version bought from grocery store) without blinking. This is definitely another level. Perfectly grilled served on a bed of rice. This is an eel luver dream in GTA and worth a detour IMO. 
The specials menu also caught my eye as it had interesting items that aren't so common. Lobster miso, A5 rated steak from Japan (I know its getting more common elsewhere but I think I would like to try it here as charcoal grill has its charm)  some specials with Japanese fish and if you are a Sukiyaki fan they even have the Wagyu version sourced from FAMU (one has to order ahead if I recall) 
Folks I think this is best Izakaya in GTA! Now only it was in a location where I don't have to worry about driving home and can drink. 4.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for dinner. We got there before the rush, so the food arrived pretty quickly.

We ordered lots of meat: beef tongue, chicken wings, pork cheek, duck and karaage. All of the food tasted good and the portions were great, but it was all very greasy. Almost every plate had a pool of grease at the bottom. Nice assortment of cocktails and tasty!

We asked for the bill a couple times and they kept forgetting the bill, but kept our water glasses full. :P 

The place was packed by the time we left. Heard a lot of good things about this place, maybe I'll go back and try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for an authentic Japanese meal on a Thursday evening at 9pm. The food are in small portion and a bit pricey but you get what you pay for (good for groups of 2). Some of the things that I recommend is their takoyaki, Osaka- Cha han and the stuffed chicken wings. Also had their skewers combo and some sashimi sushi which were pretty tasty as well. All the waitress were really friendly and provided great customer service, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here on News Years Eve with my brother, and despite it being ridiculously cold, there was still a long line of people so we had to wait because we didn't make reservations (note: make a reservation, this place is BUSY).

We ordered:
- Japanese style braised pork belly with hard boiled egg and spinach (special)
- nankotsu (soft bone) yakitori: a little on the salty side, but we'll flavoured!
- waygu beef yakitori
- black cod robata
- teba gyoza (deep fried chicken stuffed dumpling)
- ebi chili
- maguro and salmon sushi
- eel avocado sushi roll
- zaru-soba (cold soba noodle with dipping soup)

The highlight me was the chicken wing. I originally thought it was going to be gimmicky, but it was actually well-flavoured and pretty different from everything else we had. The soft bone yakitori was good as well, but salty. The waygu was okay, but probably not really worth it. Several items were quite greasy though.

The ebi chili was kind of a mess - it was far too sour for my liking (like sambal sauce, but with extra vinegar) and was overly sauced such that I couldn't even taste the shrimp. The zaru soba was good, but the dipping sauce was too light, and we ended up mixing it with the sauce from the braised pork belly (OH SO FATTY) to help bring out the flavours.

It's an okay place overall - the service was really good, and it's clearly popular. Since I'm preggos, I chose not to eat any of the sushi dishes, but the eel avocado roll was quite yummy. Would I come back? Not too sure - probably not without an occassion, as the items we sampled weren't enough to make me really want to make a second trip here. But it's a decent addition to the little j-town area. Best of luck to them!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch not too long ago and boy, was I ever full! The lunch menu has a variety of options and the portion sizes are decent. I had the Salmon rice bowl which I had been craving after seeing a friend snap photos of his dish weeks earlier. My friend ordered the Osaka Cha Han which was flavourful and something I would definitely recommend if you don't like eating raw fish. 

For appetizers we ordered the takoyaki and the stuffed chicken wing. I quite enjoyed the takoyaki as it reminded me of the ones in Osaka! The stuffed chicken wing was good but I probably won't order it again -- there are other items that I'd like to try more. 

Service wise, the waiters were great but they aren't too attentive to our tea cups that remained empty for the majority of our lunch. 

Overall, I would definitely come back to try more things on their lunch menu! :)"}
{"text":"A cozy place. Had spicy salmon rolls and eel avocado rolls, 6 pcs each. The rice was a bit dry out. Their takoyaki was pretty yum though.

The service was alright. Not like other Japanese bars, no goodbyes on our way out"}
{"text":"8/10 for the quality of the food. 8/10 for the services. 8/10 for the value. 8/10 overall. 

Skewers have a good charcoal taste, and most are very good! However, I wish they had a bit more variety. The chicken skin in the Yakitori Rice was a bit burnt, but in general, it was really good.

Uni sashimi was really fresh! and the Octopus balls were also really good!"}
{"text":"The yakitori skewers here are great. That is what they are known for, you will not be disappointed if you \"stick\" to it. 

The grilled items are usually a hit or miss, depending on what you order. For example, the hamachi/yellowtail I ordered was not that great. The sushi rolls are also very medicore. I'd recommend just getting the yakitoris and you will walk out a happier person!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, but a bit on the pricey side. My cousin and I came here for a thankfully small dinner. 

We had the black cod, the BC uni, okra, sweet potatoes and squid in wasabi appetizer. I know we had other stuff but I don't really remember it. It was pretty good, but not mind blowing. I might try it again when I'm in the mood to do some spending. My enjoyment of the meal may have been lessened by the price tag."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my boyfriend. Food here is just OK. Nothing is amazing. The most delicious dish for me is Osaka Cha-Han. The stuff is very nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at jtown - a japanese plaza in markham. It is next to my office so very convenient. My fav item there is their ja ja men however i went today and they have discontinued that item - what a let down ): price wise is on the higher end... now that they dont serve that noodle , its very unlikely i will come often. Good quality, clean and good service however i do think some items are not worth the price tag. Ie uni sushi for 18 a piece"}
{"text":"So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to make me yakitori
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
Until Ju came along

Ju light up my life
Ju give me hope
To carry on
Ju light up my days
and fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey,
I like Ju
Never again to be all alone 

A nice little Izakaya place tucked near J-Town.  Not quite Guu, but an okay option if you're in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"3 hungry souls came here for dinner. We had to wait less than 20mins for a table. 

- dumplings - which was stuffed inside the chicken was flavourful and juicy
- kaarage was crispy but was too oily. A dip on the side would have been nice
- Osaka rice - really yummy, lots of different flavours and all of us enjoyed this dish a lot!
- Osaka omelette - not a lot of pork belly in it and tasted OK... 
- spicy dynamite roll - it doesn't look too special but the sauce they used tasted better than other places
- yakitori combo - $12/5 skewers is a good price. Strong grilled flavour. This was a good dish to share. 

Overall, this was a good izakaya place. Service was good. Keep in mind that portions are small and meant to be shared. It is pricey bar food so I don't imagine myself coming here frequently."}
{"text":"I told my coworker that I didn't want to write a [negative] review.  Perhaps this really IS good food and we just are ignorant?!?  
No, I owe it to Yelp to warn people about what the experience really is.

First, there is NO ambiance.  This small restaurant is tucked into a mall/retail area that is called J-town (Japanese).  I've been to Japan and it's not this shabby.  So this place is NOT suitable for business dinners or a date night, unless you want to relieve that small village feel of Japan.

Second, the menu is an abundance of the \"leftover\" parts of animals.  Liver? Check. Gizzards? Check. Bones? Check? Knuckles? (aren't those bones too?!?) Check.

I wanted to order a char-grilled item to try, but the only thing I could eat was the waygu beef.

My coworker and I ordered what we knew, or what we thought we knew...
-Edemame. Not that fresh or else it was over-steamed.  And where is the salt?!?
-Agadashi-Tofu. Honestly, this was the best thing we had.  The broth had lots of tasty mushrooms.
-Hamachi and Toro sashimi.  The yellowtail was fresher than then tuna, which was mushy and flavorless.
-Spicy fried shrimp.  It was not that spicy, nor flavorful.  
Finally, the \"dumplings\".  I guess we didn't that this is really \"fried chicken wings stuffed with pork\".  My coworker ate one.  I couldn't stomach trying it because of the feathers that we still on the fried wing.  So we left two of the three \"dumplings\" uneatened.

They serve most everything in three's.  Looking around, most groups were even numbers.  Do they want to cause more angst over food?"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Good for any occasion, lunch or dinner. Lunch specials are pretty affordable and you get a decent amount of food."}
{"text":"Located on the very outskirts of Toronto and in Scarborough, decent Japanese food can actually be found. It was a few blocks from the hotel I stayed at when I was in Canada for the night. - It was quite depressing when this was the last night being in Canada and I was not able to enjoy some delicious Toronto food, however, it all worked out in the end.

If you are a big takoyaki lover like me, you must try the Osaka Fried Rice. Every bite you take will taste like heaven on takoyaki land. $9 CAD for this is the best buck of your money and you will definitely not be missing out on anything. 

Another great deal was the Salmon & Ikura Gohan ($17 CAD). If you are a salmon and roe lover, this is a must have. The roe was not salty whatsoever. The perfect amount of pop when you burst the teeny roe. 

If you love baked oyster, definitely get the oyster mayo with cheese. Quite pricey for an oyster for $8 CAD, but it is hard to find places that bake its oyster with cheese."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Izakaya Ju since it was close by. We barely made it before they had their last call for lunch as well.

My friend ordered the Udon from the lunch menu which came with char siew or bbq pork belly in Ju's Special Broth, whereas I ordered their Asari Ramen which was limited only 10 orders a day - so I decided to give it a go!

Tea was served and service was good and they were attentive. The salad came first, presumably because of the lunch menu. We shared the salad, it was alright, nothing special about it.

My Asari Ramen noodles came next, which has tons of clams and it is supposed to taste \"light and rich in flavour\", which was very true. The broth tasted very light at first and the rich flavour after.

However the entire bowl of ramen was very plain as it was just tons of clams, with green onion and ramen noodles. For $16, they gave tons and tons of clams which I was delighted about, I mean, they had better gave a lot for charging $16.
A little tip that I did was to peel all the clams from their shells before tucking into the meal & I placed the shells in the empty salad bowl.

Next up was my friend's Udon, which came with 2 pieces of BBQ Pork Belly, green onions, drizzled with seaweed. My friend claimed that the meal was just alright, and had has better elsewhere. I've also tried the broth and their \"Special Broth\" didn't taste anything extraordinary.

They also had these condiments on the table. I would like to say that they are authentic Japanese spices but I don't know that much... It seems authentic with the Japanese writing and ingredients listed, etc. It is J-Town afterall! I just found it pretty cool:) .

Halfway down our meal, our server brought us the bill... I know we were late to their lunch service and they close before reopening for dinner service. But we still felt rushed and pressured to finish our meal without enjoying or savouring it... Ohwell.

Overall, this place was just okay to me. Even though I thought their Asari Ramen was their recommended/popular dish since they advertised it separately, it was just meh and nothing too special. Everything was just average here but I do like the service (before they rushed us by bringing the bill over). Servers were attentive, checked back on our meal and refilled our teas without us asking. It could also because we came late to the lunch service and there were not many customers were in the restaurant... thus we get all their attention, so to speak.

Felt like it wasn't worth the value and I definitely had better lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4
Service-3
Food-4
Strikeouts-0/3

Came here for lunch, and it is definitely expensive if you want to get full at lunch here. The combo portions are extremely small. Smaller than most other Izakaya places. The only good portion was the special order of Clams (Asari) Ramen, it was definitely a good dish, heck all this food here is good, but man the cost for lunch just isn't right. Definitely much better place to come for dinner. For an average sized guy, this place ain't gonna fill."}
{"text":"I came upon this place one day in J-town, due to being too lazy to drive far. A memorable dish was the pork stuffed chicken wings, however it was more like dumpling fillings inside the chicken wings, not actual meat, but the dish was enjoyable nonetheless.

The place is rather spacious, and quiet for an izakaya so would definitely recommend for large groups. (You don't have to yell to hear each other)

Price-wise, it is actually a bit pricier the north york or downtown izakayas, but the quality is just not the same unfortunately."}
{"text":"I first went here 5 years ago to show my folks what an izikaya was.  We had a great time.  Time has not gone well for izikaya ju.  We ordered the black cod, some skewers, sashimi and all of it was just such poor quality.  Normally black cod is good no matter where I go but they even managed to over cook it and it was just not that smooth and full of flavour that I was expecting.  The skewers were a little dry and the meat nothing really that special."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that hubby and wifey always frequent and always take friends along.

Hubby of course needs to have his chicken kaarage, which has been consistently juicy and done well. And his other favourite from this place is the chicken burger. Sounds unusual menu item for an Izakaya but is absolutely worth trying.

Wifey usually gets their popular Osaka cha-Han, which is pretty much a takoyaki-like fried rice. So delicious!!! Another you must try is the Teba Gyoza (deep fried wings stuffed with ground pork). Yes, I said it. Wings stuffed with meat!

Overall, the quality of their food has been consistent. We just love the mix of flavours."}
{"text":"We ate here and spent a lot of money on a very small quantity food that left us hungry (not all pictured).

The food itself also wasnt pipping hot such as the yakitoris etc. Seems like they were served at room temp/almost cool.

Portions are also way too small? The meat skewer had three chicken pieces that were like the size of my thumb. Comparing to other izakayas, definitely poor value.

Maybe they had a bad night as it was pretty empty. I only gave this izakaya a chance when Shiso Tree next door had a line up (I hate line ups).

A plus is that it is located in J Town so its very convenient for an after dinner Japanese snack at the mini supermarket across from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Always here for brunch, and love the yakitori salad, grilled skewers set and miso black cod."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch over the weekends. We saw that most tables ordered the Osaka style fried rice (Osaka Cha-Han) and therefore decided to give it a try. I liked the sauce on top, but couldn't finish the rice. The sauce was not enough to be mixed with the rice at the bottom and so it became a little dry near the end. 

We also ordered their deep fried chicken stuffed pork dumpling (Teba Gyoza) as an appetizer to share. This was not bad but I thought the ones from Kiu were better."}
{"text":"IF i can't make it d.t to have izakaya foods -- i'l just go here and have it!
things that i will still love and always will order is the osaka rice!! mmm too yummy!"}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju works for me...

An Izakaya is a type of Japanese drinking establishment which also serves food to accompany the drinks.  There are 2 elements at Ju that suits me quite well, but obviously not all people can be ME.  I think if you consider this a YAKITORI-YA, it'll be more enjoyable.

First, I am not an alcoholic by any means so not serving ALCOHOL here doesn't affect me one bit.  It might defeat the IDEA of Izakaya but don't forget that Izakaya serves FOOD too which most of us hungry people are more interested in during those lunch/dinner time.

I have been DREAMING of Yakitori and Kushiyaki for the longest time and this place definitely fulfills it.  We ordered ALL the Yakitori items from the menu.  We gave the cook full command on which should be SAUCED and which should be SALTED.  The all CAPS mean I will be back for those.

Salted: SKIN, Leg & Leek, SOFT BONE, CHICKEN WING, Gizzard
Sauced: LEG, Liver, CHICKEN BALL

Neba Neba: Chopped Natto, Okra and Japanese Yam on Salmon Sashimi, Topped with Wasabi and Seaweed.  This dish is quite unique and I'm glad I had a chance to try it.  WARNING! The SLIMY texture of Natto & Okra combination might not be for everyone.

Neba Neba reminds me of a Japanese version of Spanish Ceviche or Thai Mango Salad where the flavours EXPLODE in your mouth. It is a NEW flavour profile that I have not encountered before.

As for Rice & Noodle category, it can be omitted during dinner as I believe Jen K. had it better during LUNCH.  As for me, I don't want the rice getting in the way of my YAKITORI.  I wonder if this place would be anymore popular if they called it \"Yakitori Ju\" instead."}
{"text":"I remember the days when Ju would be standing under a little tent, grilling skewers of various meats by the doors of Heisei, rain or shine... 

Decided to check out his restaurant today for lunch. The lunch menu is of a reasonable size - not too overwhelming, which is nice. Ju's speciality is yakitori so if you're a vegetarian, it might not be the best place to dine. For my fellow meat lovers, choice is plentiful. 

Friendly to my tiny wallet, I enjoyed the Yakitori Chicken Salad. For $7, I got a good sized portion of succulent meat drenched in teriyaki sauce (hoping not to get drool on my laptop). The Father ordered the Gyu Don (thin slices of beef, marinated with a sweet soy sauce, and sauteed with onions and ginger over a bed of rice). Once again, for $8 you get a generous portion of beef slices. 

I go to J-Town on a weekly basis so I think Izakaya Ju might be my new lunch spot. Checking out their dinner menu, I'd like to come back to try it out. 

A solid 4 star ~"}
{"text":"Someone told me that Izakaya Ju is related to Guu Izakaya in some way. Well nevertheless, we decided to try Izakaya Ju to see what it's like. It's located in a small little area behind Shiso Tree Café in JapTown on Woodbine and Steeles.

Parking space is a little tight sometimes though I've never had trouble with finding parking space. If you want to avoid the possibility of it being hard to find seats, go earlier for lunch and dinner. 

Entering in, Izakaya Ju was a small restaurant with a limited amount of seats. Nevertheless, we were able to get seats without waiting.  Like the name states, this is an izakaya, where little servings of food are served. My favourite dishes were the Takoyaki balls, sashimi lunch and unagi don. Their prices are fair priced - takoyaki balls are $5, sashimi lunch was $17 (this was a very large plate compared to the rest). Other small selections are a few dollars. Have to warn you, the bill CAN add up, so have an idea of what you order! The sashimi was very fresh, I loved the salmon. The takoyaki balls were delicious, They had two small chewy pieces of octopus in them!

I would definitely come again when I am in this area."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the amount of food we got. The food also took an extraordinary amount of time to get there. We waited 30 Min for a bowl of rice with sashimi on top."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while since they renovated. I love the expanded version of izakaya ju, don't need to feel crammed anymore, and a lot more spacious and room for people to stand in the front and wait for a table. 

Their menu has changed, they have a special menu with higher end items like Toro, uni, salmon roe, most were 30+.

Since I haven't been here for a while, decided to try some of their popular items.

We got the Osaka fried rice. It was like a rice version of takoyaki. It was really good with all the sauce, pickled ginger, octopus pieces.  

We tried the yakitori combo with 5 skewers. All were really yummy and nice aroma of charcoal BBQ.  In the combo we got a skewer of chicken tail. Very interesting and fatty.  It's very small pieces like chicken hearts. 

Tried a cold started of yakko (cold tofu).  Pretty good and smooth. Onions and ginger adds a nice touch, and you add your own soya sauce. 

Got the friend chicken soft bone, this was freshly made, and very hot inside when we got it. Add a squeeze of lemon, and it has a nice refreshing taste with texture of crunchy and softness (from the batter).  

Lastly we tried the roasted green tea pudding. It was a pretty big portion good for sharing. It didn't have a strong green tea flavour, and more grey in colour.  It wasn't bad, but I couldn't locate the roasted green tea taste. 

The service here is good and attentive.  Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I went to Izakaya Ju last night for dinner with the boyfriend. We got there at around 8pm and we had to wait approximately 15minutes. The place had an authentic Japanese feel to it, which was nice. I liked how they seated people who wanted to drink on one half of the restaurant the people who won't drink on the other half. It wasn't too loud and the restaurant was very clean. Now for the foooooood!

We ordered:
1) Heart Yakitori ($2.5)
My boyfriend is the type to try the weird and different things, so he wanted to get the heart. There were five hearts on a stick. I think the thought of eating heart was what was getting to me, but it honestly wasn't bad, I ended up eating two of them. 

2) Wagyu Beef ($8)
It was a little chewy for being waygu beef, but it was still yummmmmy. 

3) Teba Gyoza ($7.5)
Teba Gyoza are dumplings stuffed in chicken wings. My boyfriend was the most excited about this one. It's really cool thinking about how they stuffed the chicken wing with dumplings. It was good, but I guess we just had high expectations.

4) BBQ Pork Belly ($5)
I love pork belly, so I obviously loved this dishhh, more fatty pieces please ;D 

5) Blue Fin Tuna Roll (Special - $8) 
This was one of the dishes in the special menu. My boyfriend wanted to get this one. He said it was really good, the fish was fresh and prepared really nicely. 

6) Spicy Salmon Roll ($7)
The spicy sauce was kinda weird for me. There was this certain ingredient that they put in and it had a weird taste to it. It wasn't too bad, where I didn't want to eat it at all, but it was different. 

7) Osaka Cha-han ($8)
The osaka cha-han is an osaks style fried rice with octopus. There were green onions in this, so I had a difficult time eating it, but i really liked it. And I thought the dish was nicely presented. I liked taking pictures of this dish.

8) Green Tea Pudding ($6)
For dessert, I got the green tea pudding and it was amazing! This was the highlight of the night for me LOL but then again, I love desserts, so I'm a little biased ahaha but it had a strong matcha flavour, so if you don't like the taste of matcha (green tea), then I'd advise you not to get it. However, if you love green tea, then you must get this! I love pudding consistency, so this dessert was perfect for me. 

Overall, I really enjoyed Izakaya Ju, but I think Guu is still better. That's just my opinion though. I would come back just for that green tea pudding tho"}
{"text":"quite authentic Japanese izaka-ya. Although each dish contains small portion of food, it tastes quite good."}
{"text":"This is must go to place in Markham in J-Town.   Lots of authentic Japanese Food.  Must have the octopus rice and cod!  Great service and good food.  Very busy so don't be surprised to wait a bit but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food! To update the reviews below - the entire restaurant is now licensed, so you don't need to figure out where to sit in order to get alcohol anymore. 

Osaka Cha-Han is definitely a star on their menu. Delicious moist fried rice with pieces of octopus served in an aesthetically pleasing half dome shape covered in sauce. What's not to like?

According to my husband and friends, the bincho-grilled chicken teriyaki burger is the best thing on the menu. I would tend to believe them as they are regulars and order it pretty much without fail every time they go. 

We had lunch - party of four. Service here is generally pretty good. Today was a bit slower than usual. In their defence they did get slammed with a few large tables right after they opened. Definitely not enough to deter coming back - but you may be taking your chances of you're on a time crunch for lunch."}
{"text":"We came here after going to pmall to buy some snacks and honey. We were snacking while shopping so by dinner time we weren't that hungry. 

I frequently go to J-town to pick up Japanese seasoning and snacks but I never notice there is a restaurant at the plaza. I am glad I looked it up on Yelp because I like the atmosphere of the restaurant.

We ordered:
Wasabi Octopus (Tako Wasabi)
Deep Fried Chicken Soft Bone (Nankotsu Karaage)
Grilled Pork Neck
Plum Sake

The wasabi octopus was well portioned and flavour was good. Nori for wrapping was cripsy. 

Chicken soft bone was hot and crunchy. Battered not too thick and chicken was not dry. 

The grilled pork neck could be seasoned a little bit more but overall I enjoyed all the food. 

Will come here again for late snacks next time."}
{"text":"Had a little teaser tasting here and can say Izakaya Ju offers a wonderful and authentic Izakaya experience. 

I've heard good things about their yakitori grill so I decided to get the yakitori combo - 5 skewers of the chef's choice. There was tendon, liver, teriyaki chicken, chicken legs, and chicken meatball. It was an interesting assortment and was really was grilled to perfection. While they were all tasty, I probably would stick to the chicken legs/teriyaki though. The tendon and liver didn't quite satisfy my palate. 

The osaka cha han was one of the cheaper entrees on the menu and don't be fooled, there's quite a bit of of fried rice there! It was really good. There's that sweet and tanginess from the mayo/HP sauce. If you like fried rice and/or takoyaki there is no doubt you will love this. There is more than enough to share. The takoyaki was piping hot and fresh. It was a tad crispier than the usual (in a good way!).

I have had the teba gyoza (the stuffed chicken wings) on my first visit here and really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it! It is a hefty half fried chicken wing stuffed with a pork dumpling. That's kind of a match made in heaven. It was pretty darn juicy. 

Service is SUPER friendly, the people here are awesome and you will feel welcomed. The price is undoubtedly on the higher side but it is worth it! With so many interesting items on their menu there is no doubt I will return here."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Thursday, it was quite empty so getting a table was no problem for 3. The place has large ceilings and it spacious. Their green tea is also pretty good

They have a bunch of lunch specials on the menu for a very reasonable price. I got the pork udon. The clearly broth came nice and hot, but unfortunately came with only 2 thin slices of pork but had a lot of leafy veggies. The noodles were nice and chewy, it was solid but nothing out of the ordinary, pretty mediocre. 

It was very busy, so we were there for a long time more than 2.5 hours just chatting and was never rushed or asked to leave which was nice and they kept pouring the tea. I will probably come back another day though due to the price and would like to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Pro: excellent food, friendly service, recommend the ramen, dried chicken, steam egg, uni

It's a little pricy. Sashimi is just okay. Sometimes wait for too long."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at Izakaya Ju for my wife's birthday.  She loved the place and the food...I just thought it was okay.  My first impression of the place...SMALL.  But the folks who worked there were very polite (Typical Japanese of course!) and the service was very efficient (Once again...Typical with their culture).  We had the Nankotsu kara-age (Deep fried chicken knuckle bones) and the Teba gyo-za (Deep fried chicken wing dumplings stuffed with pork) as hot appetizers.  My wife loved them.  I thought that the dishes were tasty but I'm not a 'bone' fan.  Then we had a variety plate of Yakitori grilled skewered meats and the Osaka cha-han (Osaka style fried rice with octopus) which I enjoyed the most because of the taste.  We finished our dinner with two different types of pudding, which I also enjoyed...rich custard and roasted green tea.  I would say that we might go back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Their yakitori don is amazing! They BBQ it over charcoal.
Portions and quality is excellent.  A must try if you are in he hood."}
{"text":"When I saw the curry rice on the menu, I was a bit hesitate. But I saw so many people has it on the yelp, so I ordered it. After the first mouthful, I was totally had no words to say. That was damn good! It contains everything I like in one bowl: curry, ground meat, Japanese rice, eggplant, cucumber, and a 70% done egg on the top. All of these things were bitten together with a little bit spicy flavour in my mouth, I felt so shocked and wanna taste it carefully and slowly but can't wait to have my next mouthful.
Oh, by the way, this wonderful dish is only $10, totally worthy!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in J-town. It wasnt too busy on a Saturday afternoon so my friend and I got seats right away. I ordered the Osaka fried rice, fish cakes, and fried chicken. I highly recommend trying to Osaka rice, it was super tasty and probably the best thing out of the things I ordered. The fried chicken was decent, but a little too fatty and soggy for me. Because this place is mainly for fried foods, try to order those rather than sushi! 

Service was great and fast. I always find the service in J-town restaurants really fast with friendly waiters. I'd come again to try some other dishes if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great izakaya place hidden in J Town. We were very generous with our orders, tried a variety of dishes on the menu. Everything is delicious, especially the lamb chop. Their sea urchin is really fresh yet there was no trace of fishy smell. We made reservation, sat down at around 6:45 on a saturday night, not as noisy as other izakaya i've been to. Patrons got build up at around 8, and there was a huge lineup as we were heading out. So try to go earlier rather than later for dinner. Three of us spent abt 160, a little more than what we expected, but again we did went for a good number of choices, and were more than full. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times because I live close by. Service is great (pretty much all Izakayas have good service). My favourite dish here is their Osaka fried rice with octopus. Though their food is pretty good, nothing is really outstanding or memorable. This is just an OK izakaya imo. I have been to better."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim; the place was cute and had a nice ambience; service was very attentive and kind.  
We tried: 
- horsemeat tartar - softer than some beef tartar I've tried; flavourful with a hint of sweetness; comes with a small egg yolk (quail?) which works well with the dish. Delicious and will order again!
- Osaka Cha Han - essentially takoyaki on rice; not bad for $10; didn't have large pieces of octopus like others have commented but that is to be expected if you are familiar with takoyaki balls... I enjoyed it.
- curry rice - my favorite of the night; just wished they game the same amount of meat and egg but doubled the rice (I love my rice).  It was a simple clean curry - but delicious nonetheless! Well done.
- karaage - crispy, flavorful, juicy - never was a big fan but this one is not bad 
- Ju Udon - broth was clean and nicely seasoned; didn't get to try the rest of it as it was inhaled by my slightly sick companion
- Yakitori on Rice - not bad as far as Yakitori goes... I've always found these to be too simple but the sauce is quite good
- Custard pudding - too dense for my liking... very much like a dense Leche flan
- Roasted Green Tea pudding - love green tea so naturally I love this pudding... very refreshing and a great palatte cleanser... I could've finished a second one!
This place definitely deserves a second try - curry rice, horsemeat tartare, Osaka Cha Han,  & green tea pudding will be making comebacks but I would like to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"3.5 star. They have excellent lunch specials. I always get the curry beef on rice or the grilled chicken on rice. Comes with a side Japanese salad. The staff greets your entry in a loud fashion, just as most izakaya places would. They expanded the restaurant a little while back, I think by double, so getting a seat isn't as tough this time around. Definitely recommend eating here, and then checking out the other shops in J-Town for awesome Japanese snacks."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago. I had the eel rice which was very expensive, I was disappointed to open the box and behold a bed of rice topped by eels. Nothing else. No vegetables. it was quite plain as one can imagine. The skewers didn't make an impression on me, the price did however, even though I did not pay. Overall for around $90 we came out not feeling satisfied at all nor were we full. Maybe if I ate sashimi it would be a different experience"}
{"text":"There's been a number of izakaya restaurants that have opened up ever since Guu invaded this city a few years back. When I think of izakaya I think of great food, great drinks and even better conversations. It's one of those nights out when your company is front and center and the food is really the side dishes. But of course there still has to be great food. For the most part Izakaya Ju delivers!
I had a great time at Ju because I had great company and really good food. Unlike the more popular Guu you can actually hold a good conversation in here. No rowdy teenagers screen and yelling and no communal tables full of drunks either. It's also a bonus that this place is cheaper than Guu with better quality food. Ju somewhat reminds me of the few underground(in the basement) izakayas I was so blessed to visit in Japan. Tiny delicious dishes of meats and vegetables prepared right in front of your eyes in a variety of ways to accompany your drink of choice. Since there are no designated course and order of eating, you can order whenever you like, eat it whenever you like and stay as long as you please. Because really the focus of this night is the friend, family, significant other... etc.. sharing your table and not just the food."}
{"text":"Here's an update for Izakaya Ju -  I come here quite often and I still love this place! :) 
They've renovated the restaurant by expanding it (kicked out the ramen place haha). It was a good choice because the customers are piling up.

NEBA NEBA
(Chopped Natto, Okura and Yam on Salmon Sashimi)
This is so delicious! I'm a big fan of natto beans. It's either you love it or hate it because of it's acquired taste. It's a mushy dish, yummy.

NANKOTSU - SOFT BONED CHICKEN
Crunchy cartilage, chicken. 

ANKIMO 
(Steamed Monkfish Liver with Ponzu Sauce)
After my omakase experience at YASU, Monkfish Liver became my new favourite! Tastes like buttery foie gras (on the fishy side :P).

GINDARA DAIKON
(Black Cod with Daikon soup broth)
This dish is soupy based and is more on the sweet side of taste buds. 

Yakitori:

MOMO
(Chicken Leg)

NEGIMA 
(Chicken Leg & Leek)
I usually get this with salt rather than teriyaki - salt has a lighter taste than teriyaki.

TEBA GYOZA (MY FAVOURITE!)
(Deep Fried Chicken Stuffed Pork Dumpling)
You must try this! This is one of my favourite items on the menu :) 
Plus, it comes with my beloved Okra.

OKRA
It's healthy & delicious."}
{"text":"Came here because my team had some meetings in markham. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious. 

Chicken yakitori lunch special was fantastic value, very deep flavor and sauce. Chicken was the perfect texture as well. 

I ordered the Tamago to start and was relieved by how it wasn't a vibrant yellow. the egg was a thicker, more dense, less sweet dish than most tamagoyaki. I really enjoyed this because I had a better chance to appreciate the egg. It was also huge.

The yakisoba wasn't as mindblowing as everything else but it was still 4.5/5 imo. well done.

The service was great, even though we were the last of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for awhile. I go once every 2 weeks or more with my co-workers for lunch and sometimes for dinner. 
Their grill foods are generally really tasty. In a previous review someone had said that they were serving 'leftover\" parts and the portions were small. I guess it depends what you expect. An izakaya is primarily a sake bar (drinking establishment), it's not suppose to be a restaurant with full meal sized dishes, which is why most of the menu items are small portions and grilled. It's customary for izakayas to serve snack portion foods that are usually easy to cook and grilled. As for the \"leftover\" parts comment, these are normal Japanese food items that are often served in izakayas because they're easy to grill and eat off sticks - similar to a pub/finger food environment - this might not be everyone's cup of tea of course.

For lunch, my co-worker and I enjoy the black cod - it's cooked perfectly with a tiny bit of soya sauce, it's actually my bench mark to compare black cods when eating at other restaurants. 
The chicken wing stuffed dumpling is really good, we order it all the time. it's always juicy and seasoned just right. 
The pork cheek and pork belly are also really tasty. 
Their salmon terriyaki is really good as well but not as good as the black cod.
My friends and family also enjoy the Curry rice immensely - for some of them, it's a go-to item to order. 
The reason I haven't given this place all 4 stars is because the service is not good. It's slow and sometimes the waiters forget things like refilling water or the bill. I think this is primarily due to the small space confinement which doesn't allow them to have more wait staff at once. Last week they were under renovations to expand and take over the space next door. I'm hoping they're open for lunch today to try out this new environment and extra large kitchen. If it's 4 star worthy i'll come back and revise my review."}
{"text":"So glad we visited this place! The quality of their fish is great, and everything tastes amazing. Went during Saturday lunch and was seated right away, though it gets really busy so try to come a bit early. They have great lunch specials, and I think the prices of most items are pretty fair for the quality. Didnt get to try the izakaya, but the things I did try (grilled eel, takoyaki, osaka fried rice) were all very good."}
{"text":"Popped by for lunch on a Saturday, it was very busy but we were lucky to grab a table. We ordered their sushi/sashimi lunch, udon and assorted skewers and octopus tartare. Their food is fresh, seasoned well and done with a lot of care. Their assorted meat skewers had a great charcoal taste without being burnt. Their broth for their udon was light, noodles were chewy and they had pork belly which gave the meal some protein. The sushi and sashimi looked fresh - rice was seasoned well and their fish looked fresh. Their octopus tartare was too chewy for my liking and the taste of wasabi was overwhelming. The service was prompt and quick - very friendly as well. The prices are on the higher end, for two people, it cost around $80."}
{"text":"If you want to eat authentic Japanese food, this is the place to go. 

Food is authentically delicious, I use the word \"authentically\" because you need to have a palate for authentic Japanese food. As well, this is one of the few establishments in the GTA that has a Japanese chef and servers. 

We ordered the Yakitori combo, Pork knuckles deep fried with a Panko coating,  grilled mackerel,  and a couple of other dishes. The food is reasonably priced but the portions are more Japanese size instead of the North American style t have at we are used to at the everyday Japanese restaurant.  Sushi was very fresh but the price was steep when compared to other casual dining restaurant.  Decor is devoid of any lackluster,  but is something you would find in a typical joint in downtown Tokyo, around the Ginza area.

I would award 5 stars for the food and 4 stars for the decor and service which was rather slow. All in all an enjoyable experience,  with a $30 tab per person which included sake and beer."}
{"text":"Overall 4.5 stars.  Round up to 5 stars due to services.

I don't usually like tapas because I think it only works when there is big group to share food.  In addition, the portion is too small for the price.  Izakaya Ju survives my 2 biggest criticisms of tapas well.

My family came to celebrate Chinese New Year.  We ordered so many dishes that I could not remember the names.  I did recall that the rice entrees (we ordered 2 to share) were excellent.  They were fresh, tasty, soft yet with texture, uniquely flavoured.  They were well portioned for 1 person as a meal, so I thought \"oh, even a lone diner can order a meal easily here\".  Just like that, Izakaya passed my first criticism.  I also really liked the stuffed chicken wings.  The wings were well fried and well seasoned.  I recommend them even they were one of the more expensive items on menu.  I was not impressed with the yakitori combo.  It sounded like a good platter on paper, except one of the items in the combo was just tasty soft bones.  For vegetarians, please note that Izakaya Ju had one vegetarian noodle entree on menu.  

As for my second criticism of tapas, the rice and noodle entrees, the stuffed chicken wings, the salmon in broth and the yakitoris were reasonably priced for the portion and representative of the skills and work it took to make them.  The mixed mushroom was over priced in my opinion.  The grilled eggplant was not memorable because the flavour was non-descriptive, as in not spicy, not salty, not sweet.  Just eggplant with a hint of soy sauce.

Services were excellent.  The various servers were helpful, polite and fairly efficient given how busy the restaurant was.  We had a party of 5 adults, 2 seniors and 2 children.  The restaurant was totally accommodating and gave us a long table, so we could sit together.  The restaurant was family friendly, and the waitresses were gentle with the children.  

We made reservation, so we didn't have to line up at the door in cold weather.  Reservation strongly recommend for large party."}
{"text":"I have not been here for years and so glad I re-discovered them. I would says it is probably the best uptown izakaya. Enjoyed everything we had and found the prices to be very reasonable. Also they had a great selection to choose from. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Husband wanted to eat their chicken wings that they sold at the Mississauga Japanese Festival, so we've decided to give it another try. Biggest regret and nothing changed!

We asked  to sit far from babies, and the rude middle aged man rolled his eyes and told us \"Customers can't choose seats\" and seated us RIGHT NEXT TO THE BABIES. He had tons of other seats to he could have seated us to. (Not that we don't like babies, we love them!)

If you guys can't provide BASIC customer service, then I suggest you to close your doors. We simply asked politely where we would like to be seated in a restaurant,  and you couldn't even accommodate that. We are deeply offended. If there were an option for 0 stars, this place deserves it! 

THE MAN SERVER SHOULD BE FIRED!

Tsk tsk. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju was just alright. I came here with high expectations and I left a tad disappointed. While there were a few highlights to my meal here, overall the food is just okay and in some cases forgettable. We ordered the horse meat tartare, seared tuna sashimi, uni sushi, takowasa, osaka cha-han, mixed mushroom robata, osaka omelette, karaage, assorted yakitori set and the custard pudding for dessert.

The horse tartare was one of my favourites. I'd never had horse meat before, and I must admit, was a little alarmed when it came to our table due to how red the meat was (although it is raw, lean meat, so I suppose that was to be expected). It's a fairly simple dish, but so full of flavour. I would order it again.

The tuna sashimi was forgettable. Way over-cooked, tasted like unseasoned canned tuna. It was supposed to come with ponzu sauce but I think they totally forgot because it was bone-dry and flavourless.

The uni sushi was quite good. They had uni from Japan and uni from BC on the specials menu; unfortunately the Japanese uni was sold out, so I settled for the Canadian option. So creamy with that unique bitter flavour. I really enjoyed the one morsel I had. (It was $4 for one piece.)

Takowasa was meh. I've definitely had better tako wasabi elsewhere, say Kingyo's for example.

Osaka cha-han hit the spot but was still disappointing. Fried rice with some scrambled egg, hardly any octopus at all and topped with the traditional mayo, okonomi sauce, aonori and bonito. It was good but not worth the price seeing as there was hardly any seafood to be found in the dish.

Mixed mushroom robata was your typical cooked-in-foil-with-butter dish. It was incredibly salty and even with a huge bias for mushroom dishes, I remained unmoved by it.

The osaka omelette was also disappointing. It was mostly egg and sauce with little filling to be had, and the same toppings as the cha-han. Again, felt like a waste.

The karaage here features some cartilage maintained with the meat, which I personally don't like too much (I've never been able to get over the texture of it) but felt it gave huge flavour to the dish.

The assorted yakitori set is chef's choice. Ours came with chicken leg which was pretty undercooked, almost alarmingly so. It also included balls, wings, hearts and sternum. I'm always willing to try off-cut pieces of meat, but none of it was really memorable. The sternum was interesting and had good flavour, but again, that cartilage texture.

Lastly, the custard pudding was quite good (although we actually asked for the matcha flavoured custard pudding and were given the regular flavour). It has a custard consistency on the top layer and is similar to a flan at the bottom. It was nice but not really enough to save the meal in its entirety.

Service here is very good, our teas were constantly being topped up and the servers are extremely polite and friendly. Unfortunately, the food falls short. For the cost, I probably won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Japanese food. Skewers are a must, takoyaki-style rice is fantastic. Good service and situated next to a great bakery and Japanese supermarket."}
{"text":"I love Izakaya Ju for what it is, an authentic Izakaya before Izakaya became a thing.  When we started frequenting IJ many moons ago, it used to be a dark crammed space.  On our recent visit, we were shocked to see how brightly lit the space was.  The dining room went from being too dark to too bright.  Why not find a middle ground where you can still see you food but don't feel like you're sitting in a TV studio?  

The skewer combo is a good deal and comes with 5 assorted skewers char-grilled to yummy goodness but if you're not a fan of \"different\" types of meat, I'd opt for a la carte for the skewers.  In our combo, there were chicken yakitori (the most standard skewer with teriyaki glaze...did not rock my boat), gizzard (still too chewy...I prefer the way Koreans stir-fry their gizzards better), chicken wing (salt only seasoning is a ok!), chicken breast bone (salt only and my favorite) and one other skewer I can't recall.  We ordered the tongue skewer which came out too chewy for my liking again.  

We had an a la sashimi combo (good selection and excellent quality, better than Taro's fish in my opinion) and manila clam ramen (the scene stealer!  was light and sooooooooo good.  Super umami!)  We also had the spinach appetizer and takowasa to start our meal.  

We had a chance to sample some beers from Japan (I forget the brand but it came in a little rotund bottle) which were also great.  I liked the fact that the staff paced our meal perfectly, only bringing out enough food at a time not to crowd our table or rush our dinner.  

The bill came to $150ish tax and tip included which is about fare for the food and service you get here.  :)  Will be back."}
{"text":"Everything my friend and I ordered, from the pork stuffed chicken wings and octopus balls to the pork belly skewer and garlicky beef fried rice,  tasted as if every dish was coated in salt, especially the fried rice (which I didnt even finish). Sorry Izakaya, this is one girl who wont be jumping on the fan bandwagon."}
{"text":"Don't let the small limited lunch menu fool you like it did me. Its limited because they make the food perfectly here as appose to offering many different items but doing them poorly.

Grilled salmon and rice $13 - the salmon skin was super crispy and portion of meat is a lot better than other places that offer it in a bento box (4 stars).

Tuna sashimi with rice $15 - once again the portions were great and the sashimi was fresh (4 stars).

Both meals came with salad and miso soup

Also tried the chicken and leek skewer $2.50 each - pretty good but I was never a big fan of the grilled innards of an animal."}
{"text":"This isn't a bad place, but I didn't find much that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Staff: Friendly staff, attentive and the food came quickly.

Ambience: I feel like they could've done a better layout. The centre of the restaurant has an open gap. Nothing was really special.

Food: I had the Tonkotsu Ramen. It had all the basic ingredients, but there was nothing else to add to it. I also tried their special chicken wings stuffed with pork dumpling filling. I've never really had anything like that but I wasn't a big fan. It was a bit on the saltier side.

It was quite average overall."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening with a pretty large group like 15 ppl (?). We made a reservation for 7:30pm for my friend's birthday. I had the Osaka Cha-Han which is basically octopus fried rice. It was recommended here on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. Izakayas are generally not for filling up ur stomach and the price range is quite high. This was like $11ish dollars before tips and one of the budget-friendly items on the menu.

Flavour-wise this was decent, not too salty which is good because I don't really like salty things. The rice in particular stood out to me because it was really well cooked and chewy (sushi rice). But there was barely any octopus in it at all, literally a few pieces. Instead, u get a ton of rice. I would recommend ordering this along with something else for sharing. It's too bland on its own since it doesn't have many ingredients but the rice is good. I did have their promo (tako wasabi). It was pretty salty lol and very strong wasabi flavour. So if u like wasabi a lot u'll love it. Overall can't say much about this place because I didn't try anything else."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars considering I paid much less for dinner than I thought.

I went to this restaurant in a party of five. We arrived at 6:30pm and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table to clear and us to settle in. We were presented with two menus: One with the specials and the other being your everyday menu.

We ordered the following:
Hotaru ika - Very good considering the presentation looked awful.
Tamago yaki - Good
Agedashi mochi - Good
Marinated beef tongue - OK
Octopus balls (tacoyaki) - Disappointing considering I've tried tacoyaki from many different places.
Conch shell clam - Very good
Grilled mackerel - Very good
Garlic beef fried rice - Too much pepper
Octopus fried rice - Very good
Duck soba - OK
Yakitori combo - Very unique selection of chicken
Sesame ice cream - Excellent! Highly recommended
Green tea pudding - Very good
Rich custard pudding - Excellent!

Considering the amount we ordered and the fact we were unable to finish a few dishes, we expected our bill to be in the high 100s. However, it was only $150 including tips! Definitely not bad at all and very reasonable.

Service was also good, however the setup of the tables did made it hard for employees to reach us.

Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"My bro took me here on my birthday and andi thought it was one if the best Japanese restaurnat I ever had even better than kinka izakaya starting off with their taoyaki balls hot when you bite into them and tender piece of octopus inside soba noodles dipped in sauce phenomenal. The rice with seaweed and sauce absolutely incredible. And it is so close to me definetly coming back here"}
{"text":"Decent Japanese Izakaya. I've been here numerous times and certain items are better than others. The rice dishes are very good, like the curry. However, I found the ramen okay and not that impressive. The seating is spacious and comfortable, good for small groups and chats. However the noise level can be a bit loud particularly if it's very busy. The staff like to greet their customers as they enter and leave in traditional Japanese style, so don't be taken aback!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I had their Yakitori Don and my bf had the curry beef. The skin on my chicken was grilled to perfection and had a great crispy crunch to it while the meat stayed juicy and tender. It had a good portion of thinly julienne green onions and bits of dried seaweed. The sauce was great since it wasn't overpowering or lacked flavor. Portion was a great size since I needed room to try their Yakitori. I tried my bf's beef curry and it had a great spice blend to it, not the usual sweet curry you get from Japanese restaurants. The miso soup and salad that came with my Yakitori don is pretty standard. Food came out rather quick since the restaurant was almost full when we got there. 

I ordered the Sapporo Premium beer and my bf ordered the Kubota shot glass. Although I love my beer, I will have to say his Kubota went with the food better. 

We tried the Nankotsu (Soft Bone), Teba (Chicken Wings), Tsukune (Chicken Ball), Negima (Leg & Leek) and the Kawa (Skin). I especially loved their wings as it was crispy, had a great charcoal flavor to it and the fresh lemon juice gave the dish a brightness. The Chicken balls were great as well, soft, moist, juicy and had bits of onions that added a great flavor. I wasn't particular fond of the soft bone, it didn't taste like much and i'm not a fan of it. 

The decor is quite friendly and welcoming. Clean but on the small tight side. The service was great since my servers were tentative and served us tea when we were running low. I loved how they were speaking in Japanese and the servers would answer \"hai\".  The washroom is a little small but it was clean and well maintained. 

I will definitely come back for their dinner menu."}
{"text":"So far I have been here twice with my friends, I liked their skewers, the meat was juicy and the cartilage was very well seasoned. The service was great, service speed was also pretty decent considering it was so packed when we went, with a lot of choices on their menu. I would recommend making reservations so you don't have to wait as long around dinner time."}
{"text":"This place is very very busy, but it's well worth the wait. I just wouldn't come here when you are ravenous, because the smells coming out of the kitchen will make you want to steal the food right out from under the other patrons. 

The service is prompt, but since the food is served tapas style turnover can be a little slow. Here's a run down of what we had. 
- skewers of chicken glizzards, chicken hearts, beef tongue, waygu beef
- osaka chan han
- osaka omlette, cheese mushroom pork belly
- vinegar mackeral
- clam sake soup
- fried chicken knuckles
- octopus balls
- japanese moutain yam with mentai

As you can tell there is a mountain of choice here and it's not your usual bento box and sushi. The vinegar mackeral and fried chicken knuckles were the instant hits, however the skewer of glizzard were the surprise of the night. The glizzards had intense chicken flavour and a very firm, but pleasant chew. I have no complaints about all the other dishes and it was definitely hard to pick just a few to talk about (this review would be chapters long if I did). 

Izakaya Ju is definitely a solid pick, especially in Markham when all the other good izakayas are all downtown."}
{"text":"Came here previously for my mother and sister's birthday dinner and more recently for my anniversary. I don't remember much from the previous visit - something about great chicken wings - but I was very pleased with my most recent! I was looking at the menu outside when I was invited inside by waitstaff. The waiter told me that the waitstaff had agreed to serve me without charge as the restaurant was empty and they wanted business. I said such an offer was unnecessary as wait staff (in Canada) should not be deprived from their tip. I appreciated their intention and felt welcomed so I decided to eat dinner there. 

The furnishings were spartan, but clean, and the waitstaff were incredibly welcoming. We ordered Osaka Omelette, Lobster Sashimi & Soup, Unagi-Ju (an bbq unagi don), Black Cod in Daikon Broth, Tako Wasa, Mushroom salad, and two beers. 

The Osaka Omelette was filled with BBQ pork belly. It was a thin egg shell, topped with the usual seaweed, bonito(? I can't remember and I can't see the picture while writing this), and Japanese mayo as well as a sweet, but tart brown sauce. The rich mayo balanced by the tart sauce and the flavour and texture of pork belly was a great partnership, but what else do you expect from a Japanese omelette! 

The black cod and Unagi-Ju were my favorites. The black cod had been boiled long enough that the bones were soft and edible. The daikon simmered with the black cod was SO GOOD! The Unagi-Ju is exactly what you would expect, though the portion was quite large and is best for sharing. It was very rich and the eel they used was a good balance of fat and meat. The sauce was a bit salty for the amount of rice that lay beneath, but it was well seasoned otherwise. 

The lobster was prepared as sashimi using its tail and simmered in miso soup using the remainder. The lobster sashimi had good texture and crunch, very unique to lobster sashimi in my experience, though I was disappointed as it was not as sweet as when I had it at the now defunct Tako Sushi formerly on Don Mills. Tako had their lobsters fresh from the tank, which may explain it. I think the size of the lobster was right for sweetness, but it just wasn't there. The overall flavor was also weaker. I did have this before the stronger flavored dishes.

The Tako Wasa came free as part of their instagram promotion. Hope you can benefit!  The mushroom salad was essentially a salad with sauteed beech, enoki, and (oyster? Again, I don't have the picture open) mushrooms on top. Much appreciated vegetables to balance the meal. 

Thanks Izakaya Ju. See you later!"}
{"text":"Japanese Izakaya restaurants are basically pubs with much better food.  Located in the J-Town complex near Woodbine and Steeles, it's a great place to try authentic Japanese pub food with the emphasis on grilled items and ramen.

The menu is limited to tapas style eating where you pick and choose thing from appetizers, skewers, ramen, etc..  They do have some set menus but most of them seem to be for lunch menus.  Going to an Izakaya restaurant, I do recommend just pick and choose off the menu, and keep ordering till you are full!  Eat like they do in Japan!

The food was wonderful!  Some of the stand outs were the Yakitori Combo (chef choice), Deep Fried Chicken Soft Bones, Asari (Clam) Ramen, Stuffed Chicken Wings and the Okasa Fried Rice.  The only weak spot was probably the lobster roll, but then again Izakaya places are not known for their sushi.  Other then that everything we had was fantastic!

For dessert, I highly recommend the custards (egg and green tea) as they are beautifully done.

The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice.  Not as rowdy as some other Izakaya places probably but that is probably because we are in the suburbs:)

Highly recommended and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best izakaya in Toronto! I tried every izakaya in the T.O. area and non of them can compare to this one.

Thing that you have to try:
Pork cheek Yakitori with salt (Traditional Japanese skewers grilled over charcoal fire), 
Hotaru Ika(Soy marinated baby squid) or chopped baby squid qith wasabi, 
Teba gyo-za(Deep fried chikcen wing dumplings stuffed with pork),
Asari sakamushi(Manila clams steamed in sake soup),
Osaka cha-han(fried rice), Ju's Cho-Shu Udon(best udon ever) and their puddings."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch, I thought this place off the courtyard of J-Town was ok.  Oops, read the reviews as to what to order after-the-fact, re:  yakitori...

Ordered:  Chicken Teriyaki Salad, Tokyo Ramen ($10), & Curry Rice ($10).  Portions were good for price, but I couldn't help but think, \"I could've had this stuff at J-Town By The Sea\" or one of those other places at the food court.  Truth be told was that I really needed to go to the washroom, couldn't find one, and eating here seemed to make sense since it was a restaurant.

We also ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll ($7) and a Salmon Roll.  I only tasted the Spicy Tuna and it was just alright.

Service was friendly/smiley, but on the slow side.  Not a very memorable place imho."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food. Ordered their \"special limited edition\" ramen which came with a ton of seafood inside. Also ordered a Nato which was only $1.50!! Friend ordered sushi pizza...it tasted average.
It's hidden in a small alley in j town between the Toyota and Lexus dealership, hard to find but a definite hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided on trying this place for lunch. Upon entry, the interior looked really nice, clean, and slick.

I got the sashimi lunch for $22. It took a while for the food to get to our table. When the food did arrive, I found it quite small for the asking price. I'm not sure the huge ass bowl was really appropriate for the amount served. The sashimi was fresh tasting. The yakitori don was another one of our orders. The bowl was very small! Not the size I would think to be served at this price. I tried the yakitori and found that it was also quite tasty. There was not enough meat with the bed of rice.

***BEWARE: when paying on their card moneypad.  The automatic/prelisted options to tip on their moneypad is the % tip on the whole bill after tax, which is very wrong!!! Tip should be on the bill before tax!  BE AWARE.

Our meal came to 33+tax=$37.29. I selected the 13% tip option on the moneypad, and I paid: $42.14. I didn't realize the final amount was so off until I came home and calculated it."}
{"text":"Ju Izakaya is my favourite of all the restaurants located with J-Town. While the selection of food for an Izakaya is a bit smaller, the food itself makes up for it. The set up of the restaurant is also split into two sections, alcohol and no alcohol.

We regularly order the Takoyaki which is usually pretty good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with a piece of octopus inside. 

My favourite dish is their Osaka Cha-Han which is an octopus fried rice. It's covered in the same sauce that the Takoyaki is made of which is sweet and tangy and is absolutely delicious.

Another highlight is the Negitoro-don which is a rice dish with diced pieces of raw tuna that you pour soy sauce and wasabi over. The tuna is fresh and the wasabi provided is real wasabi and not just paste.

Service is always friendly at this restaurant and food comes at a pretty good pace. If the restaurant is busy though, be prepared to wait a little longer for your food.

Definitely recommended and will continue visiting this place regularly."}
{"text":"Came here last night with 2 girlfriends after reading some of the reviews, I still decided to give it a chance. We ordered the salmon and ikura gohan, the eel rice, a couple of other dishes. Everything was extremely underwhelming and our bill came up to $50 per person including tips. You can get much better quality at a lower price at a different japanese Izakaya place eg. Nome Izakaya, especially on tuesday and wednesdays, they offer their oyster special. 

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Treated my daddybear and family for an early Father's Day lunch at Izakaya Ju in J-town today :) Greeted by friendly waitresses and even staff in the kitchen right when we walked into this cozy restaurant. You're right, it has that Guu vibe, but this place is MUCH QUIETER and I appreciate that very much! We came in at 12:15pm on a Friday and people started pouring in right after. So glad I made the reservations! Lunch service is from 12pm-3pm only.

I noticed most people ordered their lunch specials! Good deal, generous portion and comes with house salad :) On the side, we also ordered a lot of mini a la carte dishes - GREAT for sharing! For 4 people, we ordered enough to fill us up, bill came up to less than $100 after taxes and tips (yay!)

Some items stood out more than others, here are my fave!

1. Curry rice with minced beef & veg topped with poached egg
- not spicy, love the aroma from japanese curry, large lunch portion!
2. BBQ Pork Belly with spicy sauce
- not spicy at all, but melts-in-your-mouth good :D
3. Torched Vinegar Marinated Mackerel
- #love... topped with fresh sweet puréed radish, green onions and ginger!
4. Deep fried Chicken Knuckle Bones
- #crunch... looks like popcorn chicken XD very tasty.

Final note: I'm definitely coming back. I really enjoyed the food and service. Food flew out the kitchen (except the Octopus Balls, which came LAST... strange *scratches head*) and waitresses all have great smiles :D At the end of the meal, my dad took their business card and saw that the chef was actually named Ju, hence, Izakaya Ju. Omg, it just all made sense now hahaha."}
{"text":"Attentive staffs and good lunch menu. Kind of pricy and also quality worthwhile. With the expansion to the restaurant, I could imagine the dinner time be very vivid and alive. Look forward to my next meal.

One thing to add is that their menu design could be more interesting with more photos. This could be an improvement that help customer pick better more suitable meals."}
{"text":"I preferred the older menu before the expansion. Food quality is still good but it seems not as good as before. I now prefer Zakkushi in general, not just for yakitori. Still an excellent place if you're in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had the luck to book a service maintenance appointment on a very stormy night. so we had to walk and \"hunt\" dinner. we ended up here being the closest, our 2nd option. It wasn't bad that means its good. There's no wow factor to it. I guess you can say we've been spoiled by the so many Japanese restaurants in the city that our standards have been set higher. small menu , good sized portions.  Don't get me wrong, the food was prepared well.  Ramen tastes like okay ramen , rolls tasted well like rolls (huge portions) Chicken Karaage well of course tasted like chicken ...you know what I'm trying to say by now. service was great, very friendly. good selection of spirits. then that was it. Literally it was A-OK.  (\"_\")"}
{"text":"Great service.  Blue fin tuna and Chu toro is awesome. Uni sashimi and all the other sashimi is super fresh."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me.  After coming here for so many years, the food is still really good.   Came to J-Town last night to pick up a cake from Green Tea Lounge and decided to have dinner at Ju.  It was around 7pm and the place was quite pack with a few empty tables but marked reserved.  I totally forgot how busy this place gets but luckily there was 1 table free for the 3 of us.  It's great to see that the restaurant is doing so well since they were one of the first Izakaya places in GTA and with all the competition now, they are still able to keep it up.

There are definitely more items on their menu now compared to when they first open.  Love the yakatori here especially Tsukune (chicken minced meat).   Got a few yakatori, Osaka fried rice, Takoyaki and Karaage.  We also got a complementary dish of tako wasabi if you follow them on Instagram.  The food came really quickly and everything was delicious.

If you love Japanese Izakaya, then you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Best Izakaya in town for food! Love all of the yakitori offerings, my favorite is the cartilage. 
Ramen bowl is definitely in the top 3 for the GTA, the dashi blend adds a nice light finish to the broth."}
{"text":"The Osaka fried rice was probably the best dish as the sauce was tasty. The yakitori was good but nothing to write home about.  Overall the restaurant is quite comfortable as it is very spacious this is unusual for an izakaya. Prices did feel a little on the high side as well"}
{"text":"I came for lunch, and I am just a fan of their chicken wing gyoza =). Also had the tuna zuke don. It had mountain yam, haven't had that since I left japan!

They also have grill chicken soft bone, which was awesome.

Service was good, and a little less busy. They leave you alone and don't ask you the usual \"how is everything\" blah blah, but if you need anything they were a step away."}
{"text":"Japanese Izakaya tucked inside the J-Town plaza (at the end of the pedestrian street) with a strong lineup of cooked dishes. Reserved a weekend dinner with a small group of friends but there weren't lines so walk-ins could've been ok. The interiors were plain and brightly lit, more like a casual cafeteria compared to the typical lively/visually-rich izakaya atmosphere. Staff were attentive and helpful in recommending dishes to try.

Dishes I liked:
- Gindara Daikon
- Salmon Ochazuke
- Osaka Cha-han ($8): THE BEST - highly recommend!! If you ever wondered what takoyaki fried rice would taste like, this would be it. We ate two of these cause it was so good and affordable.
- Roasted Green Tea Pudding

While lacking in \"socially exciting\" izakaya ambience, the upside is that the food is better value for the taste and portion - and in good company, you have all the ambience you need anyways!"}
{"text":"Food: 
Sashimi combo for 2: 4 stars ($25 for 12 pieces)
Tokyo Ramen: 3 stars ($10)
Tonkotsu Ramen: 3 stars ($11)
Takoyaki: 4 stars ($5 for 6 pieces)

The sashimi was very fresh and was at the level of melt-in-your-mouth quality. I particularly enjoyed the scallop sashimi; they were big pieces and sweet. The sashimi combo included 2 pieces of each of the following: salmon, red tuna, scallop, octopus, red snapper?, and one other fish I am not familiar with but nevertheless, it was GOOD!
As for the two ramens, I thought it could use more toppings but they were still good overall. The Tokyo ramen was soy sauce-based and the tonkotsu ramen was pork bone-based. Both were sufficiently flavourful. I like how it's not too salty but not too bland. There is one big circular piece of pork belly? that came with the ramen; I wasn't a fan of it. Too fatty and not the kind that dissolves in your mouth. The fat was kind of firm...just didn't like it. I just gave it to my boyfriend. The noodles were firm and chewy, which I like. Portions were probably on the smaller end but it is an izakaya, so not fazed by the delicate quantities. 
Takoyakis were soft and gooey, and drizzled with all that yummy creamy mayo. Pretty standard fare for an izakaya and wouldn't say it's spectacular, but still put a smile on my face as I shoved them hurriedly in my mouth =)

Ambiance: 3 stars
Clean and brightly lit interior. It was very busy when I was there on a Friday night. Simple tables and chairs with a nice wooden bar area by the sushi chefs. Wouldn't say the place is cozy or comfy enough to sit and chat for hours but good for a casual date or friendly dinner.

Service: 5 stars
The lady who served us was very nice and always wore a smile on her face, which I appreciate. She was very good with clearing our dishes (our table was small) before serving us the rest of our food. They even had another girl who goes around refilling tea and water throughout our meal. The food came out quickly and more or less all at once. Must say, it was service worth the tip =)"}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju is a clean, bright, and cosy place ideal for knocking back a few beers and having some decent Japanese bar food to go with it. The menu shows an okay level of variety, ranging from standard grilled items to the sushi and sashimi. On my visit, my group ordered many delicious dishes including the Osaka pork belly omelet, yakitori set, shio wagyu skewers, a sashimi special, and a sushi special.

The yakitori set was very well put together play of flavours and textures, ranging from the cartilage to the liver; this selection of charred smoky and savoury skewers were naturally an excellent accompaniment to the beer.

However by a good margin, my favourite dish here was the omelet--- the combination of the sour pickled ginger, the savoury bonito and nori flakes, the creamy and sweet kewpie mayo/soy drizzle, the fluffy egg, and the fatty belly made for a really exciting bite.

Honestly, the omelet was only rivaled by the delectable chu-toro nigiri topped with a nob of creamy uni in my \"premium sushi\" set special. Plated on a long wood plank, the sushi set was thoughtful progression of fresh and choice morsels.

While the price point seems a touch steeper than expected (even for an izakaya), I am already creating a list of other items I'd like to try on my return visit."}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju has a pretty diverse menu with various grilled skewers options, sushi, ramen, and seasonal dishes as specials. We ordered the assorted sashimi, a mixed yakitori plate, and an okonomiyaki omelette. The sashimi is premium as you get a good mix of tuna, salmon, squid, octopus, hamachi, snapper, and mackerel. The yakitori plate is good but not great, with a chicken wing, two meatballs, pork belly, gizzard, and okra. The omelette is creamy good, though I wish the portion was larger. Overall it was a pleasant experience though it is a bit pricey for what you get in return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before they renovated and once again when they first opened. The new renovations was definitely a good choice, because every time I have been there it has always been packed and the tables are like 2-3 inches away from each other. Looks more modern and lots more space. 

The Zaru Soba and Negima (leg&leek) are my favourites, the soba is served as 'dipping noodles' and the sauce is not too salty and wasabi is a must! Definitely recommend. Negima (sauce) was flavourful, perfectly cooked and the leeks were delicious. Other items I have tried are the Tako Wasabi - octopus marinated with wasabi stems and served with seaweed paper (i believe its raw, has a funny/rubbery texture, but the wasabi goes really well with the octopus), Ju's Cho Su Udon (a very light broth not very flavourful) and Osaka cha-han (like a huge takoyaki, could use a bit more sauce because only the top is slightly covered.) 

As for the yakitori, I tried the lamb chop, momo (leg), chicken ball, chicken wings, pork bell, pork bell w/ green onions, and pork cheek. I enjoy them with 'sauce' over salt, because I feel the sauce makes everything slightly sweeter/like teriyaki and you can really taste that charcoal flavour in the meat.

Overall, I enjoy this place because its so much closer to where I live, the staff are friendly and the quality of the food is quite good!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this restaurant because I have watched it evolve over the years. I still remember when the owner set up a tiny booth in the winter outside Jtown selling grilled chicken skewers, and he told me he wanted to open a restaurant there. In a few months Izakaya Ju was open and they had a very limited menu with the focus being the Yakitori chicken, but over the years have expanded the menu and real estate to take the adjacent store space too. 

My favourite item is still the Yakitori don which is only available during lunch. The chicken burger is also amazing! Obviously their speciality is the yakitori, but I have tried almost everything on the menu and every dish is consistently good quality with good presentation. They hire all Japanese servers and so the service is great. It may be a little challenging for some people as their English ability isn't the greatest, but they are more than patient. 

Their menu may not be as extensive as some other izakayas, but it is a nice cozy spot with reliable quality and service."}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju is one of the rare places I recommend NOT to come here for Lunch Special.

Come after work to Izakaya Ju for a authentic Japanese experience. Watching my Yakitori being prepared on open flame did the extra excitement.

Kawa - skin (salted) $2
Negima - leg and leek (salted) $2
Tebasaki - chicken wings (salted) $3
Tsukune - chicken ball (sauced) $3

Takoyaki ($5) is one of the best I have yet in Toronto. There are 2 octopus bits inside each ball. Cooked perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. The sauces and the pickled ginger went well together.

Great Japanese cocktail list for around $6. I could not try any out this evening because I was too tired and driving too.... (Yelp Friend said Call a Taxi!)

I will be back again to Izakaya Ju for more... and of course will be with some sake/cocktail! Kanpai!"}
{"text":"Worth a visit by anyone who likes sushi, sashimi and izakaya. The fish is perfect. Quality of fish is head and shoulders above 90% of the sushi restaurants in the GTA. The scallop rolls. Wow. The dynamite rolls - with a hint of lemon - a classic roll balanced to perfection here. 

Wait to be seated. Sit down and enjoy. A buddy and I went and got a pitcher and truly pigged out. It came to about $125 with tip and tax. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Izakaya Ju for quite some time now, but every time it became an option to try, someone always recommended elsewhere. Since I am finally back in town, I finally had a chance to try it for myself! I now understand why so many of my friends recommended other locations as I was sincerely disappointed by Izakaya Ju.

Firstly, service and ambience. Very typical authentic Japanese owned establishment and friendly service to match. However, despite half the restaurant being full and being overstaffed (much of the staff was just standing around with 2 or 3 just standing around doing nothing), the service was extremely slow. We also finished ordering the food and waited 15-20 minutes before we had to ask the waitress for some green tea, which arrived right before our first dish. 

Secondly, food. Nothing really outstanding flavour-wise, but definitely outstanding in terms of price! I didn't really consult yelp prior to going to Izakaya Ju - but it wouldn't have changed my experience. My family and I ordered the sashimi combination for 3 ($24 for two people, +$12.50 per additional person) and the combination came out with disappointing portion and small variety of fish with three slices each. The sashimi was good, but wasn't as fresh as I would have liked, especially considering the price. I've had perhaps the same quality of fish at Mi-Ne or Gal's but for a much more reasonable price. We also ordered the horse tartare. Nothing special, wouldn't really recommend ordering it as there wasn't much seasoning to it - it was literally just raw meat placed on a bed of sliced cucumbers and a raw egg on top. The black cod was decent, the expected standard at different izakayas across the GTA. What was sincerely disappointing was the yakatori. The skewers were bordering the burnt side, charcoal flavour was very apparent if not overpowering, and they were all hard/tough to chew.

Overall, I probably will not return and I personally wouldn't recommend Izakaya Ju to any friends although the food is decent. I just find the menu extremely overpriced and the selection was sub par. You can get a much better experience and delicious meal at a different izakaya (ie: Guu, Nome, Izakaya Tsuki) for a better price."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a couple of friends. We liked the ambiance. They have a nice selections of small dishes, tapas style, great for sharing with a small group of friends as you get to try many different things; very small portions though. Server was friendly and attentive.
We had a number of dishes, couldn't remember all the names: 
1) Tokowasa: baby octopus mixed with wasabi sauce served with seaweed. Octopus was nice and fresh; you wrap octopus with seaweed. They were a bit stingy with the seaweed though; we had to order extra seaweed leaves 
2) BBQ pork belly: flavourful. We enjoyed it.
3) Satsma (aka deep fried fish cake): nice flavour, one order came with 6 pieces 
4) octopus balls (tako yaki): decent portion with 6 balls. Good flavour 
5) deep fried tofu: this was my least favorite, tofu was very bland, was disappointed 
6) chicken wings on skewers: were delicious, my fav out of all the dishes 
7) garlicky beef fried rice: small portion of rice with beef, peas and seaweed flakes. Just OK

We also had a few sushi rolls. I liked the snacks better than sushi. I don't think they do sushi very well here, definitely had better sushi else where 

We wanted to try Deep fried chicken knuckle bones but they didn't have it today.

Overall, we had a good dining experience. Will come back with friends"}
{"text":"I don't understand the fascination with the place. I get that it's an \"authentic\" Japanese restaurant but taste wise it's nothing special. 

Here is what I ordered:

- skewers combo (chefs choice): 3/5 honestly not that great but was the stronger one out of the three dishes I ordered 
- chicken karaage: 2/5 bland taste but crispy the sauce tastes like cheap mayo except yellow instead of white 
- dynamite roll: 2/5 below average in comparison to other restaurants 

Don't give into the hype, if you're looking for taste, I would go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Was looking forward to some good chicken yakitori but lacked in sauce (usually sauces are marinated thoroughly but  the inside had no taste of sauce) 

In fact the chicken for yakitori salad was RAW. Yup...gooey, and saw blood. Really grossed out at that point. (We did mention this towards the end and they took it out of the bill) 

Last but not least, the tuna donburi that we ordered was missing the yam. The waiters seemed busy to catch, but after being patient we finally mentioned this and received the yam that was forgotten. The meal was already half eaten at that point.

The kamo leek soba was ok...the broth was too light for my taste. But the meat was fine.

By the way, the menu on their website is old. old as in they raised the price. Everything is generally +3$ so don't be fooled!

So ya. Not coming back. So unfortunate since we were really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Last minute birthday party run in the dead of the coldest winter I remember to date (which is probably mild for those in Russia).

Had a party of 8 coming here to enjoy random food choices to try things out.  Normally this would've been pricey, but considering we had 8 people at just over $120 with tip, I would say it was a good deal.

Most of the food we liked.  Some like the chicken knuckles were just too exotic for my tastes.

The Ox Tongue donburi was excellent in terms of meat quality.  However, the sauce is no match for what my friend's dad makes.  The meat was tender and you don't get the cheap aftertaste that you get from Chinese Cafes.  

The Chicken Donburi was especially good.  It had a sweet taste and I would really like to try it again once I am off my diet, because the rice they use was well fluffed.

The Beef Gyu Don, wasn't as good.  It had too much onion and little beef.  It was also very salty.  So I won't order that one again.

I ordered takoyaki like I did before.  And like before, I know this isn't Japan, and I am pretty sure Japan has better, but this is one of the better takoyakis I had in North America.

Considering it was packed the service wasn't too bad.  Will come here again soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the take out  from izakaya Ju. Initially, I wasn't expecting too much since the texture of the food changes when it's not served hot or fresh. However, the yakitori's and the chicken skin was still juicy and crispy. The taste and texture of the yakitori's reminded me of the ones I had  in Asia. I am definetly excited about going there for dinner and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Izakaya Ju is an enjoyable and cozy place offering their own special variety of dishes, great service, and reasonable prices. 

Among the regular dishes, I liked their takoyaki and karaage. But I found the yakitori chef special to be average. Although the special dishes that impressed me were the teba gyoza and Osaka cha han. A must try! You can easily order and share with friends in order to have a taste of everything. 

As for service, it was friendly and professional. However, be advised that if you have a group of 3 or more, it might take a while before you get seated. So best make a reservation if you have a large group. 

Overall, I'd give Izakaya Ju a 4/5 and would be happy to eat there again if I'm around Jtown."}
{"text":"If you feel like having Japanese food, but don't want the same old sushi joint, check out Izakaya Ju. The majority of their menu items are cooked and their speciality is grilled dishes. I've been here 3 times since I found out about it in early January and that's a pretty good return rate for me! I love the maguro zuke don with all the yummy red tuna with soy over rice. The ikura and salmon gohan is a bowl of salmon and salmon roe over rice. If you like salmon roe you might like this, but I found that there was hardly any soy and my bowl of rice didn't come out yummy like the maguro zuke don did. The takoyaki and grilled cod were table favourites and the BC salmon on the specials board was apparently really good too (I didn't have it). 

The decor is weirdly cute... giant shower curtain at the entrance and plastic hearts over track lighting. 

I've found that, as an observation of the three times I've been here, it's easy to end up spending more money than you expect to here."}
