{"text":"Just tried this place out. I think they've been around a bit but for some reason I never made it over the hill to check them out. Kinda wish I had sooner! Looking forward to trying other things on their menu. I tried their regular medium pizza with canned mushrooms on it. Loved it! Not all places have canned mushrooms anymore so it's nice to see they do. Great hand tossed pizza with a good home made flavor. Great crust and lots of toppings. Reminds me of some of my favorite childhood pizza shops and the staff was friendly when I picked it up."}
{"text":"We love MM pizza and order it at least once a week. Always tasty and fresh. Customer service is always friendly and helpful.  They are an independently owned ( NOT A CHAIN!) business -- always happy to support a local business and with pizza this yummy it is a pleasure to do so!"}
{"text":"I order the spaghetti and meatball, and the Parmesan chicken.  It was very dry, and not a lot of sauce. In other words, there were more noodles than sauce. Due to using so much noodles, it made the meal appear larger than what was actually available. In addition, it came with a side salad and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was well done,and difficult to eat.  The salad had a huge chunk of iceberg lettuce that was not chopped done. I also purchase a burger for $6.  It was so small and not worth the money spent.  The taste wasn't too bad, just didn't get what I felt was worth the money I spent.  I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"We love Mama Meatball's pizza - best in the burgh! The cheese they use is especially delicious and adds so much to make this pizza amazing. We've tried most of the other places in the eastern part of the city and theirs is the best. Usually ready in about 20 minutes if you pick it up, and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!! Their pierogie pizza is to die for!! So potatoey cheesy and delicious. And you can't forget their AMAZING sausage and ricotta pizza. I swear, it's unlike any pizza you've ever tried.!! The employees always welcome you in like your part of the family, a genuine Italian atmosphere. DONT FORGET DESSERT! Changes daily and is always homemade. You can't go wrong with one of the brownies. Simplicity at its finest!!!!"}
{"text":"This little takeout place on Rte.130 isn't much to look at, but the folks are friendly, the menu extensive, and the prices reasonable.  Most important, though, is that the food is great!  I had one of the best meatball subs I have ever had here last week.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Hot garbage!! I ordered $31.00 of food including the tax and they over charged me by $6.50 somehow. I called and they played dumb about money. As for the food they say Jumbo Split Wings right on the menu and I get tiny wingdings so yeah that's a scam. The sauce was good but it was just sweet baby rays so nothing special there. The pizza was bland and atleast two inches smaller than every other medium in the area (or anywhere else I've ever seen). The hoagie was average and I can't really knock it. The lead time for delivery was 55min and I live 2 blocks away. They will be out of business soon and this is why."}
{"text":"Tell Bruno make it a Hawaiian with jalape√±os!! The best!  Can't go wrong with the famous meatballs, ricotta, and spinach pizza"}
{"text":"Tried another local pizzaria for delivery - with a houseful of hungry kids goofing around - and they sure did deliver! With the bad service and quality I've gotten recently with 2 other local shops, I was about to give up, but someone recommended Mama's...so I gave them a call. The fellow on the phone was polite and even recommended a better deal than my original order, which I'm glad I listened to. An XL pie and a steak hogue with everything came quickly, hot and very delicious! The price was reasonable too! Definitely my new order to deliver pizzaria! Excellent!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a while and have been wanting to try Mama Meatball's for just as long. Finally tried it, and it's one of the best pizzerias in the area, in my opinion. Very nice and friendly owners, ricotta sausage pizza delicious,  breadsticks delicious, and of course, the Meatballs are delicious. Crust is nice and thick, crispy on the bottom, chewy on top. Good sauce to cheese to topping ratio. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the new owners are really cool people. I like the gyros, The Italian hoagie and the Pizza of coarse !"}
