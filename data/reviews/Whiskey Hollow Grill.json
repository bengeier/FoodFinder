{"text":"I hadn't been to Whiskey Hollow for more than a couple years and the only thing that hasn't changed is the decor. Apparently it has changed hands. It's now cash only so hello 1980. The menus are cheesy thin glossy paper (my local pizza joint has a higher quality menu). The service was adequate and not a stitch more than what was absolutely essential to get food on the table. The food itself was delicious. My daughter, grandson and I had the seafood chimis, good but pricey at $14.95. Three bottled beers for $20. My s-i-l's crab cake sand was \"Good but I've had better.\" No more \"known for our desserts.\" Now it's ice cream with choc or hot fudge. Overall disappointing. Glad we had a living social voucher so our not-so-great night out for 3 adults + 2 kids was $60 instead of $110."}
{"text":"MY family and I go here all the time... The cocoanut crusted chicken is amazing I always get it on my California salad... I luv the homemade salad dressings also... The turkey Rachel is my favorite and the buffalo chic salad is the best!!! Don't miss the chic chimichanga this is one of the house faves!!! Finish it off with the banana burrito with vanilla bean ice cream which is perfection!!!"}
{"text":"My family goes here every monday. Yes, every monday! Well at least my dad does even if he is solo.  I think my favorite thing about the restaurant is the staff.  We always bring my nephew (1.5 years ago) and he can be handful.  I worked in the biz and I know how much of a bummer kids can be but the servers are awesome.    The food is always solid as well. Nothing fancy but solid american meals of a wide variety. Sometimes I can be picky ( esp if I am trying to be healthy) but they are always accommodating.    Pro: friendly service, full bar, wide variety, parking  Con: could use an interior spruce up  Overall: its a staple. always will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and custom cocktails are excellent and the cosy atmosphere with the help of friendly staff keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Just had to write a little something about my expierience here, I came with my boyfriend and a good friend of mine for a quick bite to eat before heading to an event later that evening. When we arrived it started out great our waitress Veira was friendly and got our drinks quickly. We ordered and the food came out fast and was very delicious!! UNTIL...I totally lost my appetite, Veira came over and asked how our food was which we said was very yummy. But while she was chatting with us she was picking her teeth, or lack there of. I couldn't have been more turned off by a server in my life. Etiquette 101 you should know to keep your fingers out of your mouth while addressing your patrons. I work in a restaurant and have for many years. My boyfriend did mention something to the manager who was very nice, and comped out bill which was not necessary. We were not looking for a free meal, but to just make sure that Veira knew to not do this is the future. Again, the food was delicious, but unfortunetly in my travels back to Pitt this will surely not be a stop for me. Sorry to post such a negative review but if this was done once just think of how many other times this has been done without anyone saying anything about it."}
{"text":"I went out with my friends here on a Wednesday night to have some drinks and a good dinner. They didn't have any beer on tap, only select few bottles which was disappointing.   The decor of the place was a drab and it was a little dirty. They had a mirror at my table which had ketchup splatter.   The food here is what saved the review. I got a mushroom and swiss burger which was very thick and handmade. The bun was toasted and the toppings where fresh. They had sweet potato fries which were tasty and much better then I had at any other place."}
{"text":"Another restaurant that was reviewed first by me has gone under! What in God's good name is going on??? Are they being slandered and libeled out of business because I reviewed them? Is it a curse?   Anyway, I rode by recently and saw that it has become Coach's. A posting on WHG's Facebook page has confirmed it. Supposedly, this happened a month ago.   Oy. Vey.   I swear I should just give up reviewing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here often and the food is always delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant.  I do not think we've every ever had a poor experience here.  Their Louisiana Seafood Scampi is outstanding & the buffalo chicken pasta is good enough to write home about."}
