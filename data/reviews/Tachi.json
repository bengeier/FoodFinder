{"text":"This is an \"okay\" place. It's average. There are pros and cons. And stand up omakase is more of a novelty. As one of my lovely friends who refused to go with me, \"I deserve to be sitting in a chair for $45!\" Lol

Service: Very attentive. Very on time. Chefs are polite in explaining each dish. No tap water option, must purchase some type of beverage. The servers will start wrapping up before the allotted 30 min is over. 

The visa machine didn't allow for tipping. So we just gave cash to the server after. 

Fish: Very fresh. Comparable to some other popular omakase places in Toronto. The tuna was melt-in-my-mouth good. 

Seaweed: Yes I am picky about my seaweed! This was disappointing. It was soft and didn't taste fresh and lacked in flavour. I've always felt that this is a make or break because a good restaurant will take care of their seaweed to keep it fresh. 

Overall... This isn't a place I would come downtown to try deliberately."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, it's good! Definitely one of the best quality sushi in the area. The omakase had excellent cuts of fish presented beautifully and expertly by the chefs, a wonderful combination of flavours and textures of the intensely fresh sashimi, combined with the deliciously warm sushi rice...a treat for the tastebuds! The reviews certainly don't lie about that.

But because the food was so great, I sort of wish I had more time to savour each bite. While it's true that you had enough time to just eat, I didn't feel that I could truly enjoy the taste of each delicate piece. Because the sushi came so fast one after the other, everything blended a bit together near the end and I wasn't able to salivate and moan over the fish as I usually do. Other parts of the omakase experience were also sadly lacking - the chef explaining each sushi, or demonstrating how it's meant to be eaten, for example. 

Service was...efficient. That's about it. I can't even really say that it was friendly. Reservations are made online, you're led to your standing spot when you enter, menus and utensils are already set up, you get your bill near the end and the machine is by your side even before the last hand roll arrives. Lol. 

Nevertheless, for a (extremely) quick and not too painful splurge on superb sushi downtown, this is the spot to go to!"}
{"text":"It's my first time experiencing omakase, so this review may be slightly biased. Note that Tachi is not as expensive as omakase typically is, due to the fact that it's a standing counter and they limit your time to only 30 minutes. The variety is also much more limited, with 11 pieces of nigiri and 1 temaki served (nothing fancy such as milt / cod's sperm). While I did enjoy my experience, I did find myself being a bit pressed for time and rushed, slightly so to the point where I don't think I was able to fully savour and appreciate each piece.

I will now review each piece individually (in order of serving), so bear with me!

Hotate
This was scallop from Hokkaido! Though quite mild in flavour, you could distinctly taste the slight sweetness. I found the wasabi to be slightly overbearing just simply due to the fine and subtle flavour of the hotate.

Kinmedai
Known as golden eye snapper, this piece was also fairly mild but also very sweet! It was a lovely delicate flavour, and I quite enjoyed the al dente bite.

Sawara
Known as Spanish mackerel, this fish is a very distant relative of the mackerel - and it tastes completely different! It doesn't have a strong flavour at all, but the texture is very sticky and mushy. Not a big fan, but I cannot deny that the fish was fresh.

Kanpachi
This amberjack had a great texture! Al dente, with a slight chew. The flavours were slightly bolder, but nonetheless still quite light.

Akami
This lean tuna wasn't very memorable. The flavours kind of fused together, but like all the other pieces, it was undeniably fresh!

Chutoro
This tuna was slightly fattier than the akami and so was a little tastier. Good, but I wish I could've savoured it sashimi style, as I found the wasabi to be on the stronger side.

Otoro
My absolute favourite!! The vinegar of the rice played a perfect balance to the fattiness of the tuna. I deliberately separated the rice from the tuna in my mouth to savour the fatty tuna. It was so good - I was in heaven! The fish melted in my mouth, with flavour exploding throughout. I could order 10 of these with no hesitation.

Katsuo
This was aged bonito with ginger and scallions. Because bonito tends to have a stronger, fishier flavour, the ginger and scallions helped mellow and balance the fishy taste. That said, you could still taste it slightly - I didn't mind it at all, but some people definitely do.

Ebi
This cooked shrimp came with sweet shrimp paste, where the sweet shrimp paste is made using ground up gray shrimp with some sweet seasonings, etc. To be completely honest, I felt a little cheated. I was hoping for raw ebi, but this was a slightly dry cooked shrimp. Nevertheless, the shrimp paste added a lovely and different kick of flavour.

Uni
While this uni was among the fresher that I've had, it wasn't the best. There was a slight bitter undertone and aftertaste, but for the most part, the uni was creamy. There wasn't a whole lot of sweetness, but it definitely didn't have any of the fishy seawater taste associated with the less fresh uni.

Anago
This was also one of my favourites of the night! I honestly prefer anago over unagi any day. The anago was simmered until cooked, and the sweet anago sauce was drizzled on top. It's actually interesting how they make their sauce! It's made using anago, and they continue brewing and simmering it while adding more anago. It's a continuing process to make a very flavourful sauce, and there's a shop in Tokyo that had their sauce for five years.

Temaki
We finished our meal with a negitoro temaki, where there was fatty tuna bits with scallions and wasabi. Unfortunately, I found my piece to be overseasoned with wasabi (similar to some other pieces), but it was still really good and a satisfying finish to a wonderful meal! The scallions were sliced thinly and then soaked in water for an hour, before being drained - therefore, there was none of the biting tones typically associated with scallions. Very wonderful!

This meal was amazing, and definitely worth it. If you're looking for a mid budget splurge, look no further! Loved every bit of it, but if I had to nitpick about the food, it would be the relative lack of variety, the ebi, as well as the slightly overpowering wasabi (though it could very well be that I'm used to lighter flavours and tones). Well done, Jackie Lin!

*As a side note, I was slightly irked by the couple beside me that kept asking for substitutions... Less rice (shari), no scallions in the negitoro temaki, no uni (slightly more understandable). The point of omakase is to entrust your meal to the chef, and leave it in their hands. Further, there should be a distinct ratio between rice and fish for the perfect balance of flavour. Maybe I'm a food perfectionist but I was a little annoyed, haha!"}
{"text":"Stand up sushi bar at Assembly Chef's Hall!
Most of my omakase experiences usually take 2 hours but at Tashi, you only have 30 mins to enjoy 12 pieces of sushi. And don't think about ordering a beer, you won't have time to enjoy it (yes I tend to nurse my drinks so I'll need more than the alloted time) but mainly it's because the server comes back with your drink order 5 pieces in -   by then you're already halfway through dinner. Overall, I love the novelty of standing to eat my dinner (although it's a normal thing in Japan), the fish was fresh, and you get to watch the chefs prepare each piece infront of you. However, 12 sushi later, I left hungry with a half empty stomach."}
{"text":"Amazing omakase for an equally amazing price that cannot be beat ($45 + tax, no tips allowed). Better than Yasu. 

I was worried about the quick in, quick out concept but the pace was just fine. 10 nigiri and 1 temaki in 30 minutes. All the fish was fresh, tasty and flavourful. My favourite pieces (oh man, possibly all of them?) was the anago saltwater eel which melted in my mouth, kanpachi, medium fatty tuna, hotate and the ikura which I usually don't like. The rice was warm, didn't fall apart and was not dense. Our chef spoke limited English but watching her work was wonderful. 

If I could add one change, it would be for there to be complimentary water or green tea. Unlike other omakase joints, there isn't an option to add additional pieces that you enjoyed at the end, although they had a special feature (amaebi) for $7 which could incorporate into your meal. 

Don't expect to be able to have a heartfelt deep conversation with your friends here. You are here for the food.
If you like to slowly eat your food, this pace would not suit you. The nigiri are expected to be eaten in one bite while your next piece is being prepared.

Make your reservation online and be on time. 
When you enter the Hall through the Richmond entrance, continue all the way to the back and you'll see it on your left."}
{"text":"****I FOUND A LIVE PARASITE****

It was found in the chirishi attached to the white fish. It was still moving. I posted a pic and video.

I had to check with a number of restaurants as to how this can happen. I've been eating Japanese for +30 yrs and I have never encountered this. All the sushi chefs I speak to tell me the handling and cleaning process is poor. Chefs often find parasites but they put it through freezing process that would kill all parasites, which can cause sickness.

The restaurant operator refunded my meal and offered me another experience. But honestly, why would I trust it? Poor handling of food doesn't only happen once

Also, tachi uses the same fish as it is a joint restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh boy this place had high expectations. This being a landmark review for moi I so wanted it be a perfect meal. This came close.
45$ for a set menu and a 30 min time limit this is Omakase for people on the go as there isn't even any seating. What we do get is a private place with a small group to share wonderful sushi. I would go as far as saying this is conductive to a quick conversation with fellow diners. After you have checked the boxes via reservation or a lucky walk in one is brought into the dinning area. The menu is posted outside so you know what to expect (great in labeling pics as its too fast to label and post pics). The few questions that were asked are whether anyone has any allergies and whether one would like to order a drink. Here is a play by play
Hotate: Excellent start. Gleaning fresh 
Hirame:Fluke/Flounder isn't my fav type of fish for sushi/sashimi. I personally am not a fan of white fish for sushi/sashimi so I thought this was OK
Kinmedai: Seabream fared better. Again very fresh
Kanapachi: Decent for a yellowtail
Akami: Good start for a taste of the tuna trio. Good starting point for maguro
Chutoro: Excellent. Popular cut of tuna done well here
Otoro: a bit of an acquired taste but I do enjoy my fatty tuna this was very good
Sawara: Not a fan of Mackrel
Katsuo: Smoked version. OK
Ikura: A bit of acquired taste I found it to be decent
Anago: I am a big fan of Anago. Done well here so I enjoyed it a lot. Perhaps the top dish for moi
Temaki: Fellow diner recommended this as explained the special nori they source. Tuna version for the hand roll. Decent
This is very good sushi and at this price a steal IMO. Now I wouldn't treat it as an event meal by any means. This is a quick meal designed to make people not linger around and savor much. There are no options to add on the meal (one can always eat back to back :) 4.5 Stars all said and done.
Yup this is the 1000th review folks who thought we would come so far!"}
{"text":"I felt like I was whisked away to Japan for my 30 minute meal!  

The pieces were amazing.  The quality was top-notch!  Toro, chutoro, uni, etc... 

It may not be enough for everyone, but it was just right for the average person.  

I did feel a tad rushed as I am a slower paced eater.  

Overall, I was very satisfied though.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"I call this.. speed sushi.

This place is an omakase-only restaurant, standing room only. This place serves high quality sushi--right up there with Yasu. Today's menu consisted of Hotate, Kanpachi, Ishinagi, Kinmedai, Akami, Chutoro, Otoro, Katsuo, Ebi, Tako, Anago, and a Negitoro Temaki.

As in all omakase style restaurants, the chef introduced what the fish was and where it came from. He told us that wasabi and sauce are applied on the sushi already (much like yasu), and that we could (or should) use our hands to pick up the piece to eat (although chopsticks are provided too). Both the chefs who served us were very nice.

Normally, I'm all about awesome Otoro. The Otoro was indeed awesome (as expected), but I was pleasantly surprised by the Ebi and Anago sushi. The ebi had amazing texture, and the anago had a great melt-in-your-mouth softness. Both the ebi and the anago might be the best I've ever had.

In a brief chat with the chef, he mentioned that the menu changes from time to time, but it usually stays the same for the week. He mentioned there was Uni last week or the week before. Arg, too bad... I definitely need to come back when there's Uni (Otoro and Uni are my two must-haves).

This is the first restaurant I know in Toronto to refuse tip, citing \"Japanese style\" because tipping is not a custom in Japan. Their machine was not even set up to let you tip. So the total cost is only $45+tax. My round of seating only had 2 people, including me. Total meal time: less than 15 minutes. It was probably even faster than normal considering they only had to serve two people.  I gotta say this is the best omakase experience for the price. It felt like Yasu omakase quality for half the price. 

There's a little counter/shelf at knee level for people to just place their coats, purses, backpacks, etc.

If this place were any closer to work, I'd be coming here all the time and become broke. The surrounding restaurants look like they're worth a try too. Some people might be turned off by the \"rushed\" feeling, but I honestly love it. I highly recommend this place, and it is arguably my new favorite place. I can't wait to come back to try it again.

By the way, I just found that this place is opened by Jackie Lin, the sous-chef of the old Scarborough Zen and the current head chef of Shoushin.

Quality: 9.5/10. Service: 9/10. Value: 9.25/10. Overall: 9.5/10 (Not an Average)."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about this spot. The omakase a fantastic way to start an evening. I say start, because there's no way you'll be full. There are about 6 pieces, and you stand at a little sushi bar hidden behind a screen. The chef we had was outgoing and seemed to be having as much fun as we were.

The sushi was incredible. Fantastic quality, right up there with Zen in Markham (my fave fancy sushi spot).

Definitely make a reservation, definitely start the night off with your friends here!

One tip: don't buy a can of Asahi. You won't be there long enough to finish it, unless you shotgun it at the end *cough*. They have smaller cans of sake available."}
{"text":"Too rush of a meal for 45+tax. Good quality fish though. Stand feels kinda ghetto. The shop just seem cheap for the price they are asking for. You only have 30 min for your meal. You have to be on time or you will have to finish your meal with whatever time remaining. Overall the fish is good but the experience doesn't feel it worth the price."}
{"text":"Tachi is located  inside of the Assembly Chef's Hall, an upscale food court with many different food vendors to select from.  Our reservation was at 6:15 pm, and we were allowed to enter through the folding panel screen door by 6:10 p.m. to get settled.  The dining area is very intimate with only 8 standing spots to enjoy your morsels of sushi.  The sushi chef was prompt and started our omakase experience right on time.  Each of the 11 pieces of sushi are placed in front of you on a banana leaf, and are meant to be enjoyed immediately.  The finale piece was a negitoro temaki.  The fish variety does vary from what is posted on their website, so you will not necessarily be eating the same fish from what you see.  Hence, it being an Omakase meal.  However, you can get a preview of the types of fish being served the day of your dining experience by looking at the wooden plackets in front of the restaurant.  
If you're looking for a unique, quick and amazingly fresh sushi meal.  Tachi is not to be missed. At $45 a meal, I consider it very reasonable, since you are paying for the high quality fish.  Also, reservations are recommended as mentioned before, there are only 8 standing spots and the time limit per session is a maximum of 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and great experience.
When service starts, the hostess / waitress will pull the wooden slated blind and you are transported to Japan. 

The chefs move their hands swiftly and lyrically, you are mesmerized and within seconds, another piece of nigiri will be placed on your leaf plate.

One critique I have is the hostess will be bringing you the cheque and within minutes you will be forced to pay. My man friend had to scramble for his wallet and credit card as the chef was presenting the finale: the temaki hand roll with the crisp seaweed - meant to be eaten immediately. 
After the meal, I asked if he had enjoyed the temaki hand roll, he said he don't really know, because it was just too rushed to be enjoyed. 

Maybe the credit card can be pre-charged when the diners check in or ask the client to have their card or cash ready at the end of the meal as not to disrupt the last course? 

Regardless, I still enjoy the sushi and would go again. I can still feel the sensation of the fresh Ikura popping in my mouth!"}
{"text":"One word \"Amazing\" Basically, it's Omakase in less than 30mins for ($45 + TAX) Everything is so fresh! Hirame-fluke Uni from Boston, the Katsuo, Kanpachi-amber jack-toro, Hotate-scallop, Ikura-salmon roe, to name a few. 11 pieces of sushi and one Temaki-hand roll. Very fresh and tasty! I told the chef this is addictive! (even standing to eat in my heels after a long day of work is well worth it!)

I walked in at 6:30pm and they have a seating for me at 6:45pm. The chef brief us to eat it with our hand with the three fingers to pick up each sushi. In between each sushi, we are supposed to eat ginger to clear our palate. The fish is so fresh that no soya sauce or wasabi is required. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the sushi here. I think my favourites were the hotate and ikura. They unfortunately didn't have uni on the day we went. The only place I've been to that's like this is Yasu and this is way cheaper."}
{"text":"Can I say wow ! You will never be able to get these fishes at this price ! They have a great selection and omakase for $45 you will not find this any where else ! Its fresh and great selection ! Highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Great value for omakase if you don't mind having to eat quickly and feeling slightly rushed. 
This is a timed meal that requires reservations. Make sure you show up on time as you get about 30 mins to finish the chef's sample and you eat standing up (there is no seating). The fish quality and selection was delicious. 
If I were to just just the food itself, I would give it a 4/5. 
We expected it to be quick service however the service can really improve. The waitress gave us our bill before our courses were done and then brought us the machine (to take our payment) while  we still have sushi in our hand and were chewing. We had to tell her to come back later as we didn't want to handle the machine while we were still eating (we were also told to use our hands and not chopsticks to eat). Service was 2/5."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious dining experience. High quality omakase at a fraction of the price. The piece vary day to day so I'll definitely be back soon to try more.

Reservations are easy to book online and your dining is limited to 30 delectable minutes. Like traditional sushi restaurants in Japan, no tipping required."}
{"text":"Snug in the corner of assembly chef's hall, Tachi offers an unique omakase experience with a fun standing concept in a bustling backdrop. Fast and convenient, this traditional standing sushi bar offers some premium quality sushi at a reasonable price point. 

Don't be late for your seating or be prepared to either lose your reservation or inhale your sushi in record time. We arrived around 10 minutes late and because each seating is less 30 minutes, we were offered our first piece of sushi less than 2 mins of getting settled. Strikingly efficient and not a moment to waste. 

The sushi flowed quickly starting with really fresh and sweet scallop to tuna, unagi, mackerel and salmon roe on top of quality sushi rice. Amount of seasoning on the sushi was also well balanced. Bit of a bummer that they didn't have uni tonight but the o toro and tuna hand roll at the very end was really buttery and delicious and wrapped up the meal nicely. 

For $45 per person, it was good value for the amount of quality sushi. Minus one star for me because we did feel quite rushed between each of the pieces so be prepared for a get in get out service. However, there's also an unique appeal to tasty fresh sushi with a low time commitment - Definitely a spot worth checking out!"}
{"text":"High quality sushi and really nice place. 
Great idea for a quick lunch or dinner. 
I recommend it to omakase sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now for lunch and it's quick and simple and simply delicious sushi for great price."}
{"text":"Very nice place, stand-up omikase.  Quiet and welcoming.

Suggested that you make reservations."}
{"text":"A few tweaks will possibly make this place everything it can be. For those who don't want to stand up while eating... stop reading and don't go. You stand through the whole meal at a counter suitable for about 6 people. 
The sushi was fresh and fantastic - but it was a RUSHED experience. 
It's coming at you at a rapid fire pace, basically as fast as the 2 chefs are cranking out each piece .... placed on a leaf on the counter and not a lot of time to savor the uniqueness of each piece. 
We were in and out in about 17 minutes.  
Why no Toronto tap or distilled water? Dislike having to purchase a plastic bottle.
Happy to see this unique addition, but not sure how often people will pay $54 for it."}
{"text":"Great place for introductory omakase. You get 11 nigiris and a handroll, mainly comprised of fatty/ medium fatty tuna. Most of the fish were from New Zealand, Florida and B.C. We were also served mackerel and shrimp on Sunday. My least favourite sushi in the world!!! They make the mackerel taste somewhat better here, I guess.... but it was still a mackerel!!! I was also really anticipating uni, but unfortunately they're not in season. :(

Very reasonable price at $45 + tax. I didn't feel like I was breaking the bank. Tip was also already included in the $45! How nice...

15 min is sufficient amount of time to eat up all your sushi... even for the slow eaters. Experience was not rushed, but you do get a maximum of 30 min for 'dining' in."}
{"text":"Tachi is a stand-up sushi bar where you have 30 minutes to finish up your 11 nigiris and one handroll. It costs $45 + tax and no tips. I enjoyed my experience here - just be mindful that it is VERY RUSHED. This place is good for a quick meal alone / with one other person because there are only 8 spots available for each time slot. Be sure to book online because the 'seating' is very limited. I came here twice for omakase! Technically not really omakase because you're free to substitute anything that you do not like, which I prefer! Note that water/ hot water is not an option.. (which is the part I didn't like) if you want any kind of drinks, you have to choose from their drink menu.

I thought the highlight of the nigiris were:
* Scallops
* Otoro & Chutoro 
* Seabream"}
{"text":"Loved the concept of a stand-up sushi bar, the only one in Canada! The quality of the fish and rice were very good, an affordable and good value omakase altogether (45$). Pieces included, fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna, bonito, salmon roe, sea eel, scallop and so on. 

The sushi is only served at the stand up counter and the chef is welcoming, which is a plus. 

The time limit of 30 minutes felt a little rushed, but any longer would have been too long standing up. Being on time is also very important since they take groups at a time. Despite that, the decor was authentic and newly renovated! Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I love Sushi. Visiting Toronto from New York for the first time, heard Toronto has great sushi and saw this place near my office, so decided to give it a shot. I have not had stand-up sushi before but know it's quite popular in Japan, so wanted that experience as well. I went on my own as I was on business travel; and then realized it might be the best way to have the experience, as it's a short window for you to enjoy the meal, so it's best to focus on the food vs. having a conversation (though people around me are indeed having quiet conversations).

The sushi was so good. Not just the freshness of the rice and fish; it's also the quality of the fish, and the flavor. It all added up to be a really unique, unforgettable experience. The scallop was so fresh and sweet, I've only had something similar ONCE among all my Japanese meals (and I eat Japanese food 2-3 times a week). The fish all had a special fragrance that lingers in your mouth, unlike other, even very good sushi that maybe \"melts\" in your mouth but doesn't leave something beyond that. The sea eel was not cooked the usual way - sauce was added on top of the fish vs. cooked in - and it was... as others mentioned... al dente... odd word to describe sushi but delicious. Everything was so flavorful from the ingredients themselves, and the mild saucing bonded the ingredients together vs. overpowered them. LOOOOOOVED!!! Definitely coming back. Hopefully they will have uni next time - wish you could pick the fish!

Thank you Tachi for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved lunch at Tachi! From the very first bite of scallop to the last bite of tuna handroll, everything was fresh and delicious. Even the rice was good.  However, I think I was only served 10 pieces of nigri instead of 11. 

It is recommended to use your hands instead of chopsticks for the full experience. 
I asked for tap water and the server was nice enough to pour us some from the bar. 

Standing up was not a problem. The time limit of 30 minutes is enough, but you sort of have to focus on eating instead of carrying a full conversation."}
{"text":"One of the few standing sushi bars in Canada.

You're allowed to be there for no more than 30 minutes

The menu is a $45 omakase (chef's choice), with option to add whatever is the special if there is one.

The sushi was good, not omg amazing though.

Literally the moment you finish your negitoro handroll, they bring you the cheque.

I would recommend making a reservation, as it's located inside the Assembly Chef's Hall, which is a trend food hall."}
{"text":"We've been to Japan many times and have tried a wide range of sushi. From the $1 standup sushi to conveyor belt sushi to 3 Michelin Star sushi and always crave good sushi when back home in Toronto. Toronto's sushi scene has evolved over the years and overall it's gotten better, but the price that you pay is still quite exorbitant given what you get.

When we heard that Tachi would serve Omakase for $45 in Canada's first stand up sushi environment, we were excited to try it out as it had the backing of Shoushin as Shoushin quality is very good but really overpriced.

$45 + tax gets you 11 pieces and one hand roll, with gratuities included as it's meant to mimic Japan where tipping is not common. The sushi comes garnished with wasabi and soy sauce so there is no need to do anything besides eat the sushi.

Tonight's menu consisted of:

Hotate (Scallop) - super fresh, absolutely delicious with the right amount of wasabi and sweet soy sauce.

Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper) - not too soft nor too crunchy, has a wonderful texture that is rare to find in other types of fish. 

Sawara (Spanish Mackerel) - this sushi isn't for everyone as it has a \"fishier\" taste but for those that appreciate this flavour, real Spanish Mackerel is absolutely sublime as it has a very strong and sharp seafood flavour with a firm flesh.

Kanpachi (Amberjack) - extra lean fish with firm white meat and a mild flavour. 

Akami (lean tuna) - forget the \"tuna\" you've been eating elsehwere. This is the real deal and is why tuna is more popular in Japan than Salmon as it has a taste that is unmatched, even when it's the lean cut of the tuna.

Chu-Toro (Medium Fatty Tuna) - personally one of my favourites as it has a great balance of fat and lean flesh. Can really taste how fresh and good tuna is when this is served correctly.

O-Toro (Fatty Tuna) - the granddaddy of sushi that is generally the most expensive because there isn't much of it on a tuna. It's very fatty and melts in your mouth and is something that you have got to try.

Katsuo (Smoked Bonito) - very similar to mackerel but this had a nice smokey taste to it. Again, very \"fishy\" if you don't appreciate the different types of fish and has a strong flavour.

Ebi (Shrimp) - the only sushi I was disappointed with. The shrimp was overcooked and didn't taste that fresh as it tasted frozen. Shrimp is out of this world in Japan and when you get to try real fresh shrimp sushi, it'll change your mind on the hard, chalky tasting of \"shrimp\" that we often get here in Toronto.

Ikura (Salmon Roe) - delicious popping bubbles of salmon eggs. The eggs looked like they were marinated briefly in some kind of sauce that gave it an absolutely delectable flavour.

Anago (Fresh Water Eel) - not to be confused with Unagi, which is the more popular eel when eating sushi in Toronto. Anago has a more delicate feel and the sweet and thick soy sauce that comes on top compliments the eel very well.

Temaki (Hand Roll) - today we were served a negitoro hand roll, which consisted of chopped tuna and green onions. The seaweed was very fresh and crispy while the negitoro was perfect. The consistency, freshness and flavours were to die for.

Overall, Tachi is a welcome addition to the Toronto sushi scene and I suspect that the price will rise soon as $45 is an absolute steal for what you receive. Similar places in Toronto cost $80+ but the tradeoff is that you have to stand for 30 minutes, which isn't a big deal as the sushi bar here is gorgeous and tucked off to the side in Assembly Chef's Hall so it's not noisy. Only other gripe is that they don't serve real freshly grated wasabi that I'd be willing to pay more for as real sushi isn't served with the wasabi flavoured horseradish that has become mainstream."}
{"text":"Had their standing omakase meal. What a great deal for $45. The fish was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. Make sure to make a reservation online to secure your spot. Great date night experience and it's different but affordable still. My favourites were the haikado scallop piece, hand roll with tuna and toro!"}
{"text":"Maybe we should have tried this place as soon as it opened, but was so disappointed by the quality & whole experience that \"Imma get on Yelp in a minute and review this [Insert adjective] place like only a [disgruntled customer] know how.\"


[What didn't it fly?]

- No option for regular tap water. So if you want a drink, you must pay extra for it. Starting at $2 for tea

- The neta ?? (raw fish on top of the shari ??? = vinegar rice) was sliced thinly

-  All nigiri ?? were luke warm. 

- All netas ?? were pre-cut super thin

- Felt like one of the itamaes were disinterested; didn't want to be there

- No soy sauce offered (It is offered in most omakase places)

- You get crappy squared tipped chopsticks (ones that splinter easily)

- Given the bill in 12 minutes

- Dinner finished in 15 minutes

- The thing that got me the most was replacing all the delicious and worthwhile pieces such as uni & katsuo with lesser fish such as shima-aji ?? & anago ??.

MENU - March 31, 2018

1. Hirame ?: Warm & not impressionable - Ok

2. Kampachi ????: Kinda of fatty and al dente. Pretty delicious. Very good

3. Katsuo (Bonito) - Replaced with Shima-aji ??: Lean and bland. Was very meh!
 
** 

Order would have been served by the fattiest to leanest Ootoro, Chuutoro & Akami, but it was reversed in this case. Praying it isn't bluefin tuna (probably is)

4. Akami ??: Meh! Ordinary

5. Chuutoro ???: Pretty tasty and fatty

6. Ootoro ???: It was good, but sliced extra thin that it didn't reach its optimal flavours 

** 

7. Saba ?: Would have tasted better with a drizzle of lemon juice to emphasize its flavours

8. Hotate ??: It was tasty and sizeable

9. Ebi ?: Was told this was sweet shrimp which I am thinking \"Oh? Amaebi?\" Nope! It was just regular ol' c-grade grab-&-go shrimp. Can forego this one. Hate this one the most.

10. Ikura Gunkan ?????: I liked it, but it wasn't al-dente enough. The ikura were too soft and broke apart so easily when you bite into it.

11. Uni - Replaced with Anago ??: Looked forward to the uni but was so disappointed it was replaced by a salt-water eel nigiri instead.

12. Temaki ???????: Fatty tuna &  green onion. It was good, but a bit bland

[Final verdict]

Interesting concept of fine-dinning faster than eating at a fast-food restaurant. Quality was not top notch but not terrible. Really didn't like the fact that netas were warm and pre-cut. I don't quite enjoy watching the itamae place neta over shari all the while skipping the rudimentaries of fish slicing.The shrimp was just a slap in the face and the last straw. Perhaps a hit & miss but won't be returning here anymore. Again, I don't like to feel hungry after a $103.96 meal only to spend another $30 at Colibri for more food. Nope nope nope!"}
{"text":"Amazing Omakase experience for a fraction of the price! 

Came here with my husband on a weeknight and it happened to be the chef's birthday as well. He explained that we should eat the sushi as soon as it is made, preferably in one bite with our hands as it it done the traditional way, and that's how we both attempted to do it, though sometimes the \"fish\" was too big and required two bites (though this is not a complaint!). 

The quality of the food was spectacular-easily one of the best sushi we've had in Toronto, and we have Japanese food (not the AYCE kind) around once a week! The rice was seasoned perfectly with the right balance of sweet and sour, and the fish were extremely fresh. Each bite was a pleasant surprise of flavour in the mouth. We had a variety of tuna like Akamai, Chutoro, and Otoro, and others like Hotate (scallop), Kanpachi, Ikura, Ebi, and Uni, just to name a few. The scallop was definitely the best we've had in Toronto, with a hint of sweetness. The tuna pieces were all melt-in-the-mouth regardless of the type. Even the seaweed they used to wrap around the Ikura and Uni had a unique smoky flavour and crispiness that we've never tasted elsewhere. When we were served our last \"piece\", the negitoro hand roll, we were already missing the experience and thinking of when our next visit would be.

This place is a definite must-try for lovers of quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Amazing omakase experience in downtown Toronto, you won't feel disappointed with the experience. Try to make a reservation, but they also accept walk-ins. It's a small spot, only 8 standing spots, but with reservation you won't miss your dose of great tasting really fresh fish!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing time at Tachi! It was truly unique experience - feels as if we had been transported to Tokyo!  The quality of fish is amazing. The setting was intimate (only a few spots so you need to reserve ahead of time!). Each piece of sushi is presented one at a time so you really get to fully appreciate each tasty bite! I would highly recommend- I'll be introducing omakase to all my friends by taking them to this Tachi!"}
{"text":"An awesome taste into what omokase is all about. This stand up sushi spot that is located at The Assembaly Chef's Hall serves top notch sushi for $45 per person and is a 30min session which only takes 8 people in at a time - so making a reservation is a must as well as coming in a bit earlier. My bf and I sadly came 2mins late and was disappointed to have the chefs not seat us in - they are very strict on being at the restaurant for you to check in at least 5mins earlier to your reservation. Lucky for us the manager was truly kind to reschedule us for the next seating. Upon coming in, my bf and I appreciated that the chefs apologized and welcomed us back with saying they were glad we were able to get re-scheduled (though we humbly said that it was our fault for not arriving on time). Once guided to our spot at the table, you are able to see the chefs cutting and preparing the sushi that is to be served that day. Before starting a server comes to take orders in drinks and before the start of the meal the head chef asks of any allergies/food restrictions/preferences. 

The day that I went with my bf, the fish that was served was as followed: Ishinagi 
Hotate, Kenmedai, Akami, Chutoro, Otoro, Bonito, Ebi, Ikura, Tako, Anago, Temaki. Each one was exceptionally fresh tasting. Was truly worth the experience and money... and was much better than our experience at Shoshin!"}
{"text":"Modern Urban Japan is a cramped maze of deliciousness at every turn.   You often will find the absolute finest eating experiences tucked away in department stores, subway stations and alleyways.    Tachi is the first place that I've been to outside of Japan that captures that energy and essence while delivering at the highest level. 

There are no seats.  You stand up.   

You circle around a sushi counter while the chef creates an 11 course Omakase experience.   You eat each bite immediately while served.   Every piece is better than the last.  The rice has a perfect tinge of vinegar.  The tuna becomes progressively fattier.  The attention to detail is stunning. 

The best part is how it's the kind of gem that's hidden in plain site.  A small nook in the heart of the city's best food court. 

An exceptional experience."}
{"text":"When my co-worker first suggested this place for lunch my initial thought was: $45? Each? For lunch? And you have to stand the entire time??

However once the fresh sushi started rolling my misgivings fell away.

Yes, it's definitely pricey for a lunch, even when compared to all the other pricey vendors within Assembly Chef's Hall. But the sushi is definitely first rate and I dare say one of the best I've had in Toronto, stacking up against Miku, Kaji, Ja Bistro in terms of quality and freshness. The rice was soft and delicious, really separating it from normal sushi restaurants.

In terms of the ambience, they did a good job of recreating a slice of Japan in the intimate stand up setting (only 8 seats available each sitting, tucked away in a quiet corner of the busy assembly hall), down to the no tipping rule. The small space encouraged conversation between the sushi chefs and patrons and we learned about each piece of sushi. The sushi, while high quality, is not overly exotic or unusual.

Overall it's a great place to get high quality sushi, fast, Japan-style. This is not the place to go for a sit down meal to catch up with friends.

I would rank it higher if it was a bit of a lower price point and my personal preference of getting more of a leisurely paced meal and service for that price point. But it's definitely worth trying once."}
{"text":"Hidden inside Assembly Hall right off of Richmond, you have to enter in the main entrance, which looks a bit like a residential building.  The Assembly Hall is not overly busy during lunch time, and has a nice bustling atmosphere.  Tachi is hidden right inside, with two hostesses on the outside helping guests.  

Once inside it is a cozy space where there are standing tables.  Luckily for us women there is a cubby space right underneath for purses and jackets.  It is omakase style, and it is fast!  It is just piece after piece of delicious mouth-melting sushi.  I've never had better sushi in Toronto.  This is now my favourite sushi place in Toronto.

The chef is entertaining to watch and I thought he was also very cute and charismatic as he spoke to the party.  The entire experience was quick and delightful.  There's a small selection of drinks.  I opted for the green tea, which was served in a to-go cup.  My friend opted for sake, which was served in a can.  This makes a lot of sense because there is no time (or seats) to sit and enjoy the drinks.  The drinks are all made to-go.  

Aside from the sushi pieces, I also enjoyed the hand roll, which was more of a tube rather than a cone shape.  It had the perfect amount of filling, unlike your usual rice-filled hand rolls.  Amazing.

The bill came out as our experience wrapped up and there is no tipping.  It is what it is, and you just pay for it.  With my green tea, everything came up to roughly $56 if I recall correctly.  I would definitely do it again!  It's perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Very unique experience and I'm glad to have this place in town. Completely worth it. However they never have the uni (sea urchin) :("}
{"text":"Stand up sushi bar similar to the ones in Japan.  Chefs were friendly and engaging.  The price is reasonable for omakase and tips is not excepted so just $45 plus tax.  I thought only 8/12 pieces was good quality.  Ebi was just the typical shrimp you get in restaurants, Ikura and anago was basic.  I would come back and hopefully I'll get a better range of fish  The experience is rather rushed so you don't get to savour each piece but still good in my opinion."}
{"text":"From a value perspective, this is great. Shoushin guys at 10 course omakase for $45, with a no tipping policy. Excellent. This is unbeatable for downtown Toronto. It's in line with Zen Sushi, who do a 20 piece Omakase for double the price. 

Contrary to Toronto Public Health Ordinance and as per stipulations of having a Liquor License, this place however doesn't offer free tap water. For a place that serves seafood, i'm surprised by this given the impact of bottled water on marine life. Disappointing to see restaurants breaking law, and not supporting the anti-bottled water movement."}
{"text":"At $45, Tachi is a good intro for anyone who has never had omakase. The pieces are more common so you're not going to find any uni and whatnot but regardless, the fish was fresh and tasty.

The experience itself can feel somewhat rushed for some people (30 minutes including payment) and there are no chairs since everything is served at the bar. 

Don't come here for a sit down (literally) dinner to chat with friends, but it's good for a team lunch or quick bite before an event. 

If you're still hungry after, Tachi is conveniently located in Assembly Hall where there is a variety of foods to choose from."}
{"text":"One word - RUSHED. 

I could not truly enjoy the experience because I felt pressured to continue eating without being able to take the time to enjoy each piece. The various fishes my girlfriend and I tried were delicious, but we felt there was a bit too much rice in each piece. All in all, Tachi is definitely a great way to introduce people to omakase given its low price point."}
{"text":"Love it!!! One of the best omakase I've ever tried. I was impressed by the concept, and the fish was super fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Quality fish and great omakase experience. Their 11 course menu changes all the time according to seasons and everything was very fresh. However this isn't really a romantic spot since you only get to eat for 30 minutes and you stand up the whole time. Really enjoyed it though - quality sushi for $45pp.

Reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Delicious stand up omakase bar inside Chef's Assembly Hall. I loved this concept. You get thirty minutes to go through dinner and are standing at the bar watching the chefs the entire time. I made reservations about a month before and it's 45$/person + tax. They still offer a range of drinks but no dessert!  Do not go here if you want a relaxing, non-rushed meal. I got full after this for sure!"}
{"text":"To a normal person , lunch for 45$ is kind of excessive, but when you factor in the quality and the experience you get from Tachi, it's well worth it. 

11 pieces of nigiri including 2 generous pieces of scallop, Chu and otoro, sweet uni and ikura as well as sea bream, and then a handroll to finish it off was more than enough to fill me for lunch. 

I'm super happy Tachi is around and can't wait to come back again. 

10/10 would come back again"}
{"text":"Stand Up Sushi is a really popular concept in Japan. Especially in Tokyo and other bigger Japanese Cities, there are numerous small sushi joints has this set up.

It is kind of exciting that Toronto getting our own Standing sushi bar. Tachi is small with only 8 standing spots with each 30 minute time slots. Reservations highly recommended but they do take walk in.

$45 for an Omakase experience. The nirgri was fresh and well made. Just like any omakase, the offerings is seasonal and based on availability.

If you here for a leisure and fine dining experience, you will be disappointed. The pace is fast but good if you want quality sushi at a reasonable price.

I enjoyed my lunch here and will certainly be back if I have a chance. Perfect for sushi lover like myself!"}
{"text":"Tachi is the definition of a good deal for the value of sashimi you get. However the only thing that I'd like is for the actual ebi to be the one that is raw and not the cooked one. Otherwise, this meal was really delicious and I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Nestle inside the corner of Assembly Hall, is the stand up sushi bar Toronto has been longing for - Tachi. Tachi serves omakase style sushi in less than 30 minutes. 

Forty-five dollars plus tax for 11 nigiris and a handroll! Nigiris includes Hotate scallop, lean tuna, medium fatty tuna, fatty tuna, Saba mackerel, etc. All delicious with distinct flavours. The chef is charismatic and humorous. He shared a little \"sushilosophy\" (get it? philosophy shared while having sushi) on the meaning behind the hummingbird tattoo on his forearm, sometimes you have to step back or take a pause before moving forward. 

Overall, I highly recommend Tachi! Remember to be on time! :) Also, try to resist from take photos of the nigiris (which I clearly could not)! The chef warned us that each second delayed in eating the nigiris, results in equal decline in quality!"}
{"text":"Super high quality sushi but reasonably priced. I highly recommend this place for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Great, quick experience with authentic taste.
The restaurant is located inside the Google building, on the ground floor within the fancy foodcourt. As the name comes from the term \"Tachigui (stand-up eating)\", this is a standing sushi bar. There's only one 30-min omakase/chef's choice menu which comes with 11 pieces of sushi.

While you are chewing one piece, the next one is served. The space is very intimate--'stands' 7 people--right in front of the chefs, and you can watch every move the chefs make. Although definitely not good for a relaxing night out with a long chat, it is entertaining.

Food:
- The rice was prepared in an authentic way, good warm temperature that enhances the scent.
- Not all fish pieces were fresh, but most of them. Considering you are in Toronto, this is more than acceptable.
- The gradient of tuna variation was impeccable. It goes from Akami (lean red part of tuna), Chu-toro (fatty tuna), then to O-toro (extra fatty tuna).
- Another thing worth noting is the surprisingly delicious Nori seaweed. I believe it was Yakinori, nori seaweed torched to enhance the flavour.

Service:
- This is a very interactive way of eating. There are two chefs in total. They serve 2-4 customers each. They introduce each fish to you, and if you have questions, you can ask them right away.
- Other service was okay. It does feel like being very rushed, but a 30-min omakase is what you signed up for. I really like that they don't charge or even ask for tipping (no screen for tipping on the card machine). It's all included in the price; very simple, organized, and shows confidence. (*Correction: second time I went, they had started charging tips...)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! This place is lovely; it's all about the experience!  Timed 30 minute dining, one piece  at a time so you can savor every bite, and you will!! I will visit every time I'm in town. Thanks for this great place!!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience here over Doors Open weekend here in Toronto.

Arrived at around 5:40pm and there were openings for our party of 3 at 6:15pm time slot (surprisingly - for a Saturday!); giving us time to wander around the rest of Assembly and grab a snack from another vendor.

We arrived promptly before our reservation time, and was quickly led into the dining counter.  There's lots of space under the counter to place bags (2 shelves), and there are hooks along the back wall for your coats.

The hostess quickly took our drink orders - for which there 5 options: tea (3 types), ramune (4 flavours), water (bottled or sparkling), Asahi beer, and Kikusui one-cup sake. 

Then the chefs asked if we had any allergies, and informed us that the best way to eat (if you didn't know) the sushi is with your hands. (They give you wet naps to clean your hands at the start of your meal)  They are equipped with chopsticks, if you so choose. Everything is served on a banana leaf, making the food pop & look very nice on top of the green back drop.

The food was good, with distinctive flavour for each piece and sauces all pre-added for you.  Was hoping for uni - but it wasn't on the menu that day.  Tuna was the clear winner.  It was interesting to end on the hand roll.  Flavour-wise it could've been an earlier course, but I suppose it fills you up at the end.

At the beginning of the meal, it was pretty quiet - but once we engaged the chefs in conversation, things got more lively! 

Overall a good experience. Worth going at least once - and would be fun to go solo since the space is so small!"}
