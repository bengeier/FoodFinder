{"text":"Great little sushi spot. Fresh and affordable - great menu options. The service is really fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at the mediocre reviews here.  I'm an avid sushi eater and this place is just fine, not the best I've ever had, but definitely one of the best ones in the neighborhood. The service is quick and friendly -- although there are sometimes language issues -- and the food always tastes fresh. I'm particularly a fan of the ramen lunch special (five stars for that!!). Overall I consider this place a great value and a go-to spot for tasty (but not gourmet, special-occasion type) Japanese."}
{"text":"I was just at Yumi for dinner and I'm always pleasantly surprised about how consistent it is.  It has a lot to do with the owner being present nightly.  It's also because the owner is not behind the sushi bar or in the kitchen.  He's constantly walking around the room supervising.  The menu is safe and boring, but the food is tasty and prepared with care.  I rate Japanese restaurants on two criteria, sushi and tempura.  In Yumi's case, the sushi rice is properly prepared and they create their sushi with the right amount of rice.  The tempura has just the right amount of batter and does not resemble anything from a fish-and-chip place.  Yumi is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Specifically signed up for Yelp to write this review, thought the Sushi was excellent, had the dinner for two, california rolls (small easy to chew!) excellent tempura, excellent beef teriyaki. Overall I was very pleased, not a lot of great sushi places in the area it seems, this is the best I've tried"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Bloor West Village. Great service in the restaurant or for takeout. Our favorite is the Yumi  roll with tempera shrimp."}
{"text":"This place was a random pic and a pleasant surprise! It was me, my husband and our two kids. When you first sit down you get some soup, which was great so we could look at the menu and our hungry kids could start eating. We ordered spicy salmon, tori and salmon sushimi and chicken teriyaki. The food and the service was very good. For dessert were each given a nicely sliced orange. Overall we had an amazing dinner and would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi place since moving to the neighbourhood a few months ago. Always friendly and fast service with fresh and quality ingredients. The first time I picked up the chef made me a complementary hand roll for the walk home. Their party platters are amazing  value."}
{"text":"I live in the area and usually go to Sushi 2 Go.  I thought I should give Yumi another try and went there last night for take out.  I was really disappointed.  The rainbow roll only had fish / avocado on the top, not wrapped all the way around.  3 of the pieces had avocado and no fish on top!  What a rip off.  I'm going back to Sushi 2 Go."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite Japanese restaurant.  Reasonable prices and their bento box specials are delicious!  Great location in bloor West Village."}
{"text":"The portions were SOOOOO small!!!! It was actually quite hilarious.   I ordered a combo with maki and sushi, there were about 18 pieces and I was able to eat the entire thing and not feel full. Keep in mind I am 95 lbs, pretty small stomach.  The service was fine, and the food tastes good, but not worth the money"}
{"text":"I got take out just before Christmas - first time here.   The location is perfect for me, prices are not the best I've seen, but certainly reasonable.    The food was good (hot food hot, cold food cold, tasty, good portions).  It wasn't extraordinary, but I was not disappointed.    The service however, was lovely!   As mentioned, it's quite funny when you walk in how, literally, everyone looks up and shouts a greeting.  When I read about it initially in someone's post, it seemed odd.  But experiencing it, it was not.  It was really cute and welcoming.  I just got take out, and staff were so friendly, helpful, quick.  Sat me down with a cup of tea.. Most surprisingly, as I was there, I got a tap on on my shoulder and one of the ladies handed me a small Gift with a \"Merry Christmas\".  She said it was hand made soap, and was wrapped up in a sweet little paper box.    It was such a nice gesture to customers.     I would certainly return as a result of this experience.  While I had no complaints about the food, perhaps my experience would be even better dining in, rather than judging after having driven 20 mins home."}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. We have never been disappointed. This is our go to spot in West Bloor Village very consistent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was going to be in the High Park area and it was up to me to find a restaurant near there. I felt like Japanese food so I promptly typed in my criteria and up popped several Yelp lists to help me. Somehow I was drawn to this one and I was apprehensive at first since some of the reviews highlighted small portions and frustrating service. But I decided to give Yumi the benefit of the doubt and quickly made reservations.  Well, I am happy to say that I really enjoyed my experience here. Upon entering, I was greeted warmly and promptly given a warm bowl of noodle soup (very welcome on that cold day). I ordered warm sake and had a chance to study the menu before my boyfriend arrived. Because I didn't want the hassle of choosing a-la carte items, I wanted to get the set menu which included soup/salad, sushi/sashimi, choice of beef, chicken or salmon teriyaki (we got the beef) and dessert. Overall, this set dinner was filling and we enjoyed the food a lot!  This is definitely a local-neighbourhood spot. But if I am ever in the area, I would totally come back here. Service was really friendly. Price wise I didn't think it was that bad - around $80 including tip and booze."}
{"text":"I have never eaten in the restaurant, I've always got take out.   The food is consistently very good, fresh, and properly seasoned & plated.   I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ignored when I first came in as staff was too busy eating to actually SERVE a customer!!! I've been here before but this time they really blew it! Food was ok , service deplorable!!! No water, no question of any beverage.... I was going to take away but couldn't even THINK of encourage this level of disconnect with customers!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, nice variety, exceptional service and a nice chilled out atmosphere. We recommend."}
{"text":"Yumi is fairly small and is perfect for a quiet lunch.   The bento boxes are a great bang for your buck. They are very filling and have a great variety of food. The agedashi tofu, miso soup, and tempura are great.   Be sure to come before 3pm as that is when the bento specials end."}
{"text":"Yumi is probably the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to.  The food is prepared perfectly, it's a quiet and friendly environment, and the owner is always present, ensuring excellent customer service and a high-quality experience.  I once forgot an item when we took food home from the restaurant and the owner himself drove the food to our home to ensure we didn't miss out on our food.  Incredible food, incredible service, incredible experience.  Yumi is DEFINITELY worth the visit."}
{"text":"I have been coming to yumi sushi for 3 years as a regular, but I will find another sushi place. I was finishing my meal with my friend and the sushi chef brought over an Xmas present and placed it in front of my friend and I looked up at him -he made eye contact and walked away. He's normally very nice and always says hi and goodbye and I am always treated well by the staff.  I have been spending my hard earned money at this place,bringing friends here and supporting their business and they ignored me while pampering my friend? If they didn't have two they shouldn't have given it at all! What a slap in the face!!!   Someone said the same thing had happened to her down below however at least she was acknowledged. I was not acknowledged as a paying customer. How insulting and awful"}
{"text":"I've dined in about 5-6 times and find that the service is decent, but one thing that sticks is that the staff always all chime in together to greet you whether you're entering or leaving.   Sometimes they give you complimentary miso soup prior to your meal and sliced oranges after your meal, but not always.  Their menu is boring, nothing out of the ordinary but they're one of the very few places who make spicy salmon maki rolls the way I like. The prices of the sushi rolls here are not significantly higher than other places, but they range from around 5-12 dollars or so. I'm a big fan of their Alaskan roll and spicy salmon maki.  I've decided to opt out of dining in and usually now I just stop by for takeout whenever I'm in the area with my boyfriend. We always get the spicy salmon maki because we know it's good."}
{"text":"Quite surprised how the ratings here are all over the map. I've been to Yumi several times, and every time the food is excellent, the service is great, the prices are reasonable. It's clean, cozy, a hidden gem. I highly suggest it."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Toronto, I spend time on Bloor West Village. After a walk and an exercise class, a treat for me is to go for some sushi. My favourite sushi place was \"Yumi\".  On December 23rd, they gave out little gifts. Every other woman in the restaurant was given a lovely mug with some soap...except me...I received a piece of charcoal soap!  A \"lump of coal\"!!!!  You know...the coal Santa gives bad kids!!!   I smiled, said thank you, and tipped my usual 20%. Then, I left my coal on the table.  I will never return.  I hope this was a cultural faux pas,but I will never be sure."}
{"text":"There are a lot of sushi places out there. This is simply one of the worst I have been to in recent memory.  Three issues:  1. The sushi was not fresh. The rolls reminded me (both in look and taste) of the last rolls at No Frills at around 9 pm. 2. The quantity was small. For a 20$ plate you will leave hungry. 3. After eating here, I had a lingering aftertaste of MSG in my mouth.  The best thing here was a cold/frozen sliced orange they brought out at the end of the meal. Likely to try to cut the MSG."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Yumi, the first was dine in and I ordered the lunch combo. Service was great,  food tasted delicious as if everything was fresh, and we got a lot of complimentary side dishes as well.  This time around I opted to take out a dragon roll as I was heading to work. The total came to ($15) and when I took a bite the roll was warm and salmon was warm (like room temperature). It was definitely not a good experience."}
{"text":"Yumi is one of the last great non AYCE Japanese restaurants. The interior is warm and clean, the food is fresh and flavorful and the service is excellent. During the holidays they even provide you with a gift of a mug wrapped in cellophane. Nice touch.   The dinner for two provides a good amount of food with 4 courses including some sushi. The chef seems to control the seating from behind the sushi bar and greets all visitors.   All this combined with a nice walk along  Bloor Village after dinner makes for an overall excellent evening."}
{"text":"This is the sushi go to place in the hood.  I am always pleased with the service quality and the attentiveness of the staff.  The miso soup is a touch of comfort while deciding what to eat.  You always know what to expect when eating here as the quality of the food is always consistent.  I am always amazed about the amount of take-out this place does.  It is like a steady stream of people coming in for take-out however I personally would miss the full experience if I did the take-out option and choose to dine in."}
{"text":"The go-to sushi spot in the neighborhood; decent prices and food quality. They also don't charge for spicy mayo on the side...WIN!   I usually grab dinner here after work with coworkers and it's never too crowded. The staff greet you upon entering and bring small bowls of warm broth with a few slivers of noodles to cleanse (?) the palette. The fried tofu and shrimp and assorted tempura is delicious...perfect batter to item ratio. I ordered the umi sushi today and it was alright...I'll probably stick to salmon, tuna, and eel next time. The makis aren't the prettiest...sometimes the ends of the rolls are evidently the ends, but I'm okay with that for the price I am paying. Green dragon roll is great! Ample avocado slices. My coworker ordered the Florida roll and loved it. I have yet to try their teriyaki entrees...but the ton katsu is pretty tasty; I love the tangy sauce for the breaded pork and it's enough to split between two people (two big slabs of breaded pork). I also love that Yumi gives you oranges at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Food was good but we had to wait for so long to get our food. The table next to us was getting quite upset too because their food didn't arrive for an hour."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is delicious, the prices are good, and the service is quick and efficient. The tempura here is the best I have had. Ever. Ever ever. It's light, crisp (not crunchy thank goodness), and very tasty. My only hiccup today was the service. They have a new waitress, and she's still learning. She made a mistake with our order (there were 5 of us), but corrected it when we mentioned it to her. She felt really bad about it too. On the upside, when we asked for some takeout before leaving, the manager gave us a few free pieces is sushi to make up for the mistake. Yum! I should mention that this is the first time (I've been here often), that I have had any service problem at all. Overall, this is a great place for authentic Japanese cuisine. I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed with this restaurant. The first issue was with the quality of the food. We ordered the dinner for two. It started out with a couple of skewers of chicken yakitori. The chicken was over-cooked and had the consistency of wood. The next quality issue was that the chicken teriyaki (served on a bed of soggy bean sprouts) was flavourless. Although there was a dark sauce on it, the sauce was very bland. The next issue was a customer service issue. One of the items on the dinner for 2 menu was 2 servings of green tea ice cream. My dining companion did not want to eat the ice cream at that time and asked the waitress for a to-go container. The waitress told us \"it is not our restaurant style to give a to go container for ice cream\".  We asked her again because we thought she misunderstood. But she repeated the same line. We were very shocked and quite frankly annoyed by this. We had just spent roughly $50 in total at this establishment (in which the food was sub-standard) and we could not take the only enjoyable part of the meal to go? Really?? Not very good customer service. We will not be going back to this place. The only reason that I did not give it a one star was that we did order sashimi and it was pretty fresh and tasty. But, I can find fresh and tasty sashimi at plenty of restaurants in Toronto, without the attitude!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood sushi place. We had sashimi and mixed sushi and all of it was  fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is nice, and they pay attention to details in the food and presentations. The service was very friendly and attentive. The complimentary soup and fruit were delicious as well. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered the first meal for two. Great food, however we felt they were a bit skimpy on the sushi (only about 10 pieces) and it was slightly dry. Miso soup was normal (I love miso so no complaints), yakitori was delish and the beef teriyaki was done perfectly medium rare. Service was great and it was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday night (for most of our meal we were the only two in the restaurant). Considering this is primarily a sushi joint though and our sushi was the least impressive bit of the meal I had to bring it down a star."}
{"text":"Ate here, well, by accident.  I was having dinner with my cousin and he made reservations at Yama at the other end of the block; he always gets addresses wrong so after I sat in Yama for 20 minutes waiting for him, I decided to check out the other place on the block with a similar name and lo-and-behold, there he was... He was too embarrassed to go to the place he actually had the reservations at, so we stuck around.  I spent 12 years living in the San Francisco Bay Area so my tastes are... well, somewhat snobbish. There's nothing like living on the West Coast to teach you the finer things about eating raw fish. I find that most of the really popular sushi places in Toronto taste like supermarket sushi to me.  I miss having access to dozens of restaurants that serve the kind of ngiri and maki that, once you take a bite, you *have* to stop and savour and have little mini food orgasms. I've only encountered one Japanese restaurant in Toronto that offers that, and unfortunately, I can't afford to go back there more than for VERY special occasions.  So I go to Yumi.  Are they up to the standard I like? No. Are they better than the average Toronto Japanese restaurant? Yeah.  It's better than decent, the service is good, the prices are reasonable, the place is clean, well-lit and well-maintained, and all in all, worth a visit or two.  Well, three for me in the last month. :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic neighbourhood Japanese-run restaurant, you have found your place! Such a rarity to find an actual Japanese-run Japanese restaurant in Toronto! They have the perfect amount of variety on their menu, including classic teriyaki dishes along with sushi and rolls. You can expect freshly cut sashimi, well proportioned sushi, lightly battered crisp agadeshi tofu, everything presented beautifully. They have a few options for dinner for 2, which is perfect amount for the stomach and the wallet. Service is excellent. I also like that they give you a small bowl of soup right when you sit down, a nice way to warm up a bit on these colder days. I'm pretty sure we will be back again and again to this gem of a place."}
{"text":"Tried the sushi here instead of my usual spot and found it alright.  I got the Tempura and Sushi bento box, which in the picture doesn't look like much, but it definitely filled me up. There was a lot of tempura included, which were battered a bit on the heavy side. The box also came with a fried gyoza and tofu, but the tofu was cold and had this gooey sauce on it which I didn't really enjoy. It also came with one piece of a california roll(?) and 4 fresh pieces of sushi. The quality of sushi didn't disappoint, but I found myself feeling icky after from all the fried foods. For $15 it wasn't bad, but I'd probably bring a friend to share a combo or boat."}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp entree and they gave two shrimps.  My friend ordered a salmon entree and two thirds of the plate was covered in sprouts.  Then my friend asked if dessert came with the meal and she said yes and it was ice cream.  I asked if mine did as well and she said it did.  Then when she brought the bill she had charged for the ice cream.  I will not be going back.  I also found their menu very lacking on sushi rolls."}
{"text":"This place is a great find!  I don't often find myself in this neighborhood. Once in a while, I'll cover a shift over here for work but that's about it. Additionally, I'm quite the sushi-snob.   I had ordered a takeout meal for lunch and was in heaven! I order their katsu bento box with a roll... I can't remember what I ordered exactly. All I remember is that it was amazing bang for my buck as well as great quality. Definitely my go-to for this neighborhood and when I need my sushi fix.  Plus the interior is super cute! Highly recommend!"}
