{"text":"The best thing to happen to Verdun since the metro system. T&C hits a homerun on so many levels: culinary experience, taste, service, passion, staff knowledge and friendliness, local/fresh ingredients, presentation, cocktails, value for you money.... you name it! Definitely for the adventurous eater, John-Mike will wow you with some of the whacky creations he puts out on a plate/bowl/rock/tree trunk/etc. Say hi and revel in the passion he has for food, it's contagious. Manu behind the bar whips up some unique cocktails that'll keep you going all night long.   Small groups or large, they'll hook you up with an unforgettable meal. Everything is good really. Right now they've got an amazing gazpacho, pigtail tacos, TCFC (Flintstones sized Turkey leg wrapped with squid), whole suckling pig...   A really fantastically unique spot in Montreal, like nothing else out there. And no, Verdun is not that far. Go to this place now. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We had a really fun and enjoyable night!  The food and drinks were fantastic, and the service was amazing.  We will definitely be back the next time we visit Montreal.  My wife and I dined on a Saturday night and we ordered the 5 course tasting menu with the cocktail pairing.  The food was really amazing.  The standout for us was the first course of salmon belly.  I also really enjoyed the grilled octopus fourth course, but by that time we were so full it was getting difficult to finish.  Our only critique of the food was that it was very rich and very heavy.  Understandably, that is the nature of this restaurant, but I think we really could have been helped out by a bowl of rice or something to cut through some of the richness.  Also, it was fine for us because we had never dined here before, but most if not all of the courses we received were regular items on the menu.  On our next visit, this might prevent us from ordering the tasting menu again.  The drinks we all very good.  There were four cocktails and coffee included in the cocktail pairing option.  I have to say, they were matched very well to the dishes.  Little subtleties in a drink might mirror something in a dish, or the drink was the perfect weight to cut through and help out the particular course.  Although the drinks were all very good, I was disappointed that all four of the cocktails were sours.  I'm not a huge fan of sours, and I would have preferred a couple of stirred drinks thrown into the mix.  I would have even preferred a smaller volume of individual cocktail in the name of getting something a little boozier to change it up.  They did however, use Turkish raki in a cocktail, which seems like a no-brainer to me but it is actually the first bar I have ever seen this done in.  Nice job!  What truly stood out for us about the evening was the atmosphere and service.  It was a really fun, relaxed place.  The bartender who took care of us all night was fantastic.  He was friendly and chatty, and still understood when to give us some space and privacy.  The servers were all very nice and friendly.  And, even though it was pretty busy, the chef was frequently out of the kitchen making hurried but genuine rounds of the place checking in with everyone.  He was very nice and very interested in making sure everyone had a good experience and a great night.  It was a really fun and lively place without feeling roudy.  A large group in the back ordered the whole suckling pig and some kind of large format dessert.  Both looked amazing!  The desert presentation was like a piece of performance art.  I wish we knew 10 people in Montreal!  We would be here in a second!  Overall, it was a great night that we will remember.  We can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"What a jewel in disguise!!! We randomly stumbled on it, while driving by. Everything on the menu is different, surprising and exciting! Like pig tail tacos??? Whaaaat???? Or duck liver tartare??  a bit scary, but it turned out to be delicious! I had the lobster roll and the pain perdu. The lobster roll was made with a pan fried raisin bread which was deliciously caramelized, it gave the roll an extra kick and surprise! Also the roll was accompanied by popcorn!!! How fun is that??? All in all, I would recommend this place. However, the only thing that was a bit bizarre for me is the dead fur of a boar- just lying around, yaaaaaaaaks!!! Do not wanna see that!!!  Oh and also- not a fan of ketchup bottle as a soap container in the washroom, whyyyyy??? Whyyyy??? Kina a bit creepy, but I guess some might find it innovating :)"}
{"text":"Coming from New York City, I wasn't just going to settle for just some \"good\" restaurant, especially since Montreal is known for great food, so after some recommendations we decided to go to Tripes & Caviar. I was not disappointment. The food was delicious, different,  and made meticulously. The menu, which consisted of items such as bone marrow, calf heart, sweetbreads was chosen carefully and executed well. For appetizer, I went with the bone marrow and after the first bite, they had my attention. It was cooked perfectly, and sent me into that happy place we all have when we eat great food. For dinner, I decided to go with the pig tail tacos which were delicious and layered with flavors that made them unique and addicting. After I finished them, I almost wanted to get another order because I knew it may be while before I would get to eat these decadent creations again.   But it wasn't just about the food in this place. The ambiance was different. The place is simple yet was set up with decor that made you look around over and over to make sure you caught a little more of the details. I was also impressed by the music. This particular night they had a playlist of old-school hip hop, which was not too loud, but, at least for me, sent me into memory lane and some the good times of my youth. It was perfect. Good food, good music. And finally, the service. The manager was well versed on the menu, and he was a great bartender as well making us some cocktails showing us he was not messing around with his craft. Before we left the owner greeted us, gave us some great recommendations on places to go and made us feel right at home in his city.   People who live in Montreal need to go here and people from out of town need not to miss the opportunity. From the downtown it takes less than 10 minutes in an Uber or cab, so there really isn't an excuse...that is if you want to settle for mediocrity.   I wish these guys only the best and expansion of their great work with this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing....the food, although seems a bit out there, is to die for! You have to try.....well, everything. When a chef knows how to cook good food, whatever they make will be amazing....it's the case here. Come for dinner, come for brunch on the weekend....you'll get great service and won't have to wait in line forever...like those overpriced breakfast places! I'll come back, over and over...."}
{"text":"La fameuse équipe de Tripes & Caviar qui se fait déjà un nom à Montréal et à Québec depuis 2 ans avec leur traiteur et leur food club a maintenant ouvert son restaurant. Depuis que j'ai mon blog (la boufferie), je me fais un devoir de me rendre à toutes les ouvertures de restaurants.   Comment j'ai trouvé ça? Bien. On n'est pas dans de la haute gastronomie, plus dans un fast food étonnant. On y va pour un snack entre amis, pour leurs cocktails aussi délicieux qu'innovateurs et leurs plats surprenants."}
{"text":"Impressed!  I basically indulged on essentially the whole menu with several friends visiting from Toronto.  The chef's take is outside the box and a very welcome change to people who are more adventurous.  Standouts were the tendon, brain, and pig tail tacos.  The portions are fairly large (bone marrow had at least 4 bones) and the prices are very reasonable making this a really good spot to stop in by, pound back a few drinks and a snack, in addition to a full dinner.  Service was top notch including a thank you from the chef/owner before leaving.  They also have a tasting menu option that pairs with cocktails, but your whole table has to order it.  What blows my mind away is that we stepped in here at 8pm on a Saturday night at it was deserted.  We were literally one of two tables, plus a few people at the bar.  The decor is great (think bear rug) and the restaurant is huge, too - maybe a bit too well lit.  I had also got wind that this was on vice munchies.  I later found out that the location was way out of reach from the main restaurant hubs in Montreal and a borderline shady area.  It's a real shame because I could see this place booked solid through the evening in Toronto.  Judging by the lack of customers, I really hope they survive until next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! We did the tasting menu paired with the cocktails which was super reasonable. The mixologist Laurin was fantastic. The chef and entire staff were so friendly and genuine.  Food was farm to table and every dish from the bone marrow to the beef tongue to the Salmon head were very flavorful. So happy to have experienced this gem. Definitely a my must try in Montreal. Neighborhood is kind of up and coming, causal atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went with a big group of friends late one night and we were the only people in the restaurant save for the staff and a few of their friends (or that's what it seemed like). It was awesome. The food was super delicious and the staff was friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable about what they were serving us. They brought the table two orders of pig tail tacos on the house and later gave all 12 of us a round of free shots.   I had the mackerel which was suuuper tasty and my boyfriend had the marrow plate which was surprisingly inexpensive and good.The drinks were delicious and they were nice enough to make a non-alcoholic version of my favourite one (the Bangarang - so refreshing!) for a friend who doesn't drink booze.   We'll definitely be back! Can't wait to try their brunch..."}
{"text":"I loved everything I ate there. Great service and atmosphere. Every bite of food had different layers of flavour and I was just having fun tasting everything. I'm still dreaming of their duck heart tartare, so delicious!  Definitely going back and bringing my friends with me :)"}
{"text":"Really cool spot. Great for groups. Love the decor and the food is delish."}
{"text":"Sorti un peu de nul part sur la rue Wellington  ce resto vous accueille avec une ambiance feutrée, très cozzy. Old-school hip-hop en background. Quoi demander de mieux.   Ici, on sert des abats version 2014. N'ayez pas peur, dégustez de la cervelle, de la langue et même de la ratte. Tout est apprêté de façon à vous faire oublier ce qui est vraiment dans votre assiette. Excepté la tête de saumon ; difficile à camoufler, celle-la! Franchement, c'est tout simplement extraordinaire.   Niveau service, c'est bien aussi. Le chef et la sous-chef visitent souvent avec les clients et le staff de service et bar est toujours bien friendly (et font d'excellents cocktails pour accompagner les plats!). C'est vraiment une gang d'amis qui vous reçoivent comme si c'était leur salon.   Vraiment un beau spot à découvrir et je recommande fortement d'aller faire un tour à Verdun pour aller donne du gros Yelp love au T&C (ou au Castle, comme ils aiment l'appeler).   Sur ce, je vous offre en guise la prière du T&C : \" je suis ce que je mange, et je mange avec passion tout ce qui se mange. Je ne mange pas pour vivre mais je vis pour manger. Santé à tous mes amis et à la famille T&C.\""}
{"text":"J'avais très hâte d'essayer ce resto, j'adore les abats et le menu m'intéressait beaucoup. Nous étions un petit groupe et avons essayé presque tout sur le menu.  Les points forts:  - La pieuvre était cuite à la perfection. - L'assiette de charcuterie était très bonne. - La langue de buf était très tendre et bien assaisonnée.   - Le ragû était très goûteux.  Les points faibles:  - La salade de céleri qui accompagne l'os à la moelle était beaucoup trop salée, presque immangeable, ça gâchait complètement l'assiette.   - Le morceau de pieuvre servi était vraiment trop petit pour le prix payé, et l'accompagnement de patates bravas rend le prix (17$) un peu difficile à avaler (désolé pour le mauvais jeu de mots).  - Trois des plats étaient accompagnés du même chimichurri (qui était correct, sans plus), c'est un peu paresseux.  - Sur une facture de plus de 200$, ils ont chargé un supplément lorsqu'un des membres du groupe a demandé un morceau de pain supplémentaire pour terminer le ragû (qui était servi avec du pain, mais pas assez). À la limite c'est correct, mais le serveur doit au moins spécifier à la personne qu'elle sera chargée plus cher, ce qu'il n'a pas fait.  - La musique était insupportable, une compilation de soft rock 80s, je comprends qu'ils veuillent se donner une impression de second degré pseudo-cool, mais ça tombe à plat. J'avais l'impression d'être chez ma tante et d'écouter un greatest hits d'Hall & Oats."}
{"text":"We have to make some noise about this restaurant, write more reviews, spread the word how good is the food. According to our T&C host the idea of the menu is to shock the clients and bring to them some anti foodie experience. Can't agree with this, every dish on our table was a foodie experience: bone marrow with snails, tongue, piglet tails, beef heart, la ribollita, horse steak, la raie (most probably stingray, but couldn't confirm what was exactly the yummy fish in English) were delicious and cooked with imagination. The abundant use of fresh garlic in some of the dishes was perfect to enhance the taste. Note some of the dishes in the menu change depending on the available ingredients. The dessert list is a must try, at least share something with your dining companions. T&C has small list of good wines with prices for every pocket. More impressive is the list of cocktails, fantastic mixes of alcohols and flavors. Some of my beloved sake concoctions arrived in tea cups. The idea of using fine colorful porcelain for some of the drinks and dishes is actually pretty cool. Last but not least attentive service and perfect knowledge of the menu. So if people are wondering if eating in T&C may be an adventure, just go, you would love it."}
{"text":"Just delicious.  Love that Tripes & Caviar uses parts that are off the beat and path.  All of their entrees are a blend of multiple ingredients that work so harmoniously together.  I had the bone marrow and beef cheeks - both incredibly tasty.  Tripes and Caviar would be my go-to if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails! My boyfriend loves all the food but it's pretty meat heavy. Wish there was more vegetarian stuff on the menu....I'd go there more often!"}
{"text":"This place is WAY off the beaten path for most Montreal visitors but if you are an avid foodie or like things that are a little off tilt then you need to make this place a must eat ! Disclaimer: the menu is only in French BUT the staff was more than willing to translate and explain all of the menu items for my ignorant non-French speaking A$$...  I originally came here to try out their twisted pastrami sandwich but unfortunately it was done for the day.   I ended up eating getting a few milder items on the menu: Clam Chowder Lobster Roll  Tuna Spine Tar tare (not really mild)  Holy cow!!! The food is out of the world!  If I had one word to describe the clam chowder I would be texture! I am not sure what was in it but man something has a nice crunch to it (no it wasn't a shell). Delicious to the very last drop.   The spine tartar was phenomenal! It's was not like Japanese negi but more like a thick chunky consistency.  The lobster roll was good as well but nothing out of the ordinary.   You have to be a little on the adventurous side for many of the culinary and drink creations but rest assured, if it's on their menu, trust that it must be good.    One last tip: If you catch wind of on of their secret dining events, you should go! I saw the menu for their last 2 events and they were insane creations!   Love this place!!"}
