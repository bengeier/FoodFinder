{"text":"Super cute little place. Nice decor and amazing food. Fancy plating and unique rolls. Buttttttt pretty over priced for a smaller place."}
{"text":"There is a lot of different options on the menu. The service is always good. For example it's nice that they bring extra miso soup for the kids. 

I was surprised by the ramen. It's quite good. 

The lunch deals are better than what's available at dinner , but that's to be expected

Tacowasbi portion was generous and their sushi is always fresh."}
{"text":"They dont open on time. And the guy was rude. We came in 4 mins past 11 and the man didnt even let us sit down. Just promptly told us they arnt open. If your not open why is the door unlocked? Why does it say open at 11 when no one is ready? How come you didnt let us take a seat and wait?

Disappointing."}
{"text":"Over priced and does not deliver quality. Basically every element is either bought from supermarket or cheap supplement of what it should have been.

Maki is massy and soggy. Rice was warm, no salt, no vinegar. 

Dumplings is over cooked, grease and again bland, also pretty sure is store bought low quality stuff.

Rice is not even sushi grade, just some cheap white rice with no body and no taste 

And \"star\" of the bendo unagi is store bought and only four piece served for $11 price tag.

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. waited for over an hour and food didnt even come. Waitress didnt even explain why it took so long. Gave some poor excuse as its too busy. Ended up leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"I like it this place 998 naruto sushi ..I been there many years ..I feel friendly and kindly .."}
{"text":"Me and my family came here for lunch for the first time. We ordered the lunch special \"bento box\" I was very please and got really full. 
The place is tiny but nice and clean.
The staffs are A okay.
Looking forward for another lunch date with my family."}
{"text":"Must try the oshizushi! It was delicious. We ordered the spicy salmon oshizushi, passion roll, and spicy caterpillar roll (I think that's what the last one is called). By the way, none of the \"spicy\" items were actually spicy.
Oshizushi is pressed sushi and this one had salmon pressed into the middle with spicy salmon and a creamy sauce (maybe mayo?) torched on top. It was very flavourful with some smokiness.
The spicy caterpillar roll (which I am not entirely sure if that is what it was called) was alright. It is wrapped in rice paper without rice inside so it's kind of like a salad roll with imitation crab and spicy salmon.
The passion roll was meh for me. It's pretty much a California roll with a lot of cucumber and topped with slices of mango.
Will come back for sure as the sushi was fresh and yummy! The 25% discount (during the soft opening) is also a plus. Otherwise the sushi would be a little pricier than most sushi places in Aurora."}
{"text":"Nice place. lots of choice of sake. Sashimi is realy fresh. Ramen is good as well. I went there almost every week."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaurant in York region.  They have a special fish menu not found at most Japanese restaurants.  The quality is top notch.  We've always received friendly knowledgeable service from the wait staff.   I can't give them a full 5 stars because it can take longer than usual for food to come to our table, even when they're clearly not very busy."}
{"text":"Great sushi place.  Tornado sushi was delicious.
Good service, prices a bit high but still worth it.
We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"There was way too much rice on all the rolls and the pressed sushi. The sushi boats are quite expensive considering how much fish you get. If I want sushi again in Autora, I would rather go down the street to Mi-Ne"}
{"text":"i love this place,the sashimi is really fresh and the service is really good.this is definitely my go to place !!"}
{"text":"We ordered Delivery (free on purchases of $30+) on Halloween and were blown away by the quality and variety of fish in the Sushi Deluxe ($26.99) and Sashimi Deluxe ($34.99).

It was the best sushi we've had in the GTA; better than places three times the price. Food came fast, about 40 minutes from time of order. 

Izumi flies their fish in weekly from Japan so there are fish that we've never tried before. And the variety is terrific wherein you don't eat the same fish more than once or twice in a sushi / sashimi deluxe platter. 

The sushi rice was very tasty and fresh, a bit sweeter but delicious. 

The tonkontsu ramen was on point as well. The broth was very rich and flavorful. 

This is easily my new favourite sushi place. I couldn't wait to eat again so I came back today, 2 days later, for lunch!

Lunch was not nearly as good as dinner but still good value for the price. I ordered the sushi lunch for $13.99 and comes with 8 Nigiri sushi, each piece different, and 6 California Maki. The rice is not as good as dinner. But overall, still probably the best place in Aurora. Dinner is a must try!"}
{"text":"fresh food with good service?I like the rolls and beef udon, reasonable price with 25% off dine in. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Authentic jap resturant, I true hidden gem in an otherwise quiet plaza. They have a variety of fishes and seafood, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a decent sushi place in Aurora. 
They have lunch specials that range from $12 to $20. 
I usually opt for one of their bento boxes to help kick my sushi craving. I would say their sushi is pretty good, but nothing to rave about and I usually decide to come here when I want decent quality sushi."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR TORCHED SUSHI MENU!!!! Plating is amazing and very tasty. Service was slow and price was on the high range but overall I will recommend this place. Friendly crew, clean store, variety of food was great. Will always come back for a good splurge on sushi"}
{"text":"Love love love - the atmosphere is fantastic here! It's cozy, very clean and quite modern looking. Also has a touch of Japanese to it with the cloth entering the washroom area.

The staff here are so friendly and respectful. They really look out for you. When I visited I didn't get a tea kettle/pot for my table, but she served us tea every time we were running low. Such great service, so many places can learn here.. 

In terms of food, it was great as well. The sushi was fresh, meat rice and all. Ramen was great as well, very delicious and the egg was perfect! I will come back and try other things next time!"}
{"text":"A restaurant which had a great start when it first opened and quickly went downhill. Fresh fish brought over from Japan, friendly staff, and even though portions were on the small side it was flavorful. Ramen wasn't the best but fair quality. This is no longer the case.

Ordered a bowl of ramen and the corn in it came out frozen and flavorless. Literally frozen to the core. When I asked the waitress to address this, she took the bowl and microwaved it. Its corn. The cheapest ingredient you could use. A whole can costs a buck at Walmart, yet they somehow was too cheap and froze corn. If they can't even get this right, just imagine how \"fresh\" the raw fish is.

I truly enjoyed this place when it first opened. I will not return again and wouldn't recommend you to eat here. Mi ni sushi just around the corner and much much better."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. The place is decorated nicely. But the food was rather disappointing. The sushi rice came out very mushy and when you eat it, the texture just doesn't feel right. Nothing special for what they served and the prices were high for the offering."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few months back. Service was excellent. The sushi was good but a little bit pricey. We had one of the sushi dinners which was probably the best value for a party of 3. It included miso soup and salad (like many other similar sushi restaurants)."}
{"text":"I'd never dine in at the restaurant before, I had always ordered delivery on the app just eat and I really liked their foods. I was very satisfied with the food that I get, but it is little but expensive compared to most sushi places I order from. Plus I recommend not to deliver because I've been experiencing longer waiting than was told to me, especially when it's only a 15min drive."}
{"text":"My friend had recommended me to come here and had an enjoyable experience.

Food: great tasting food (although the uni was a little bit too fishy for my taste)
Service: The server was great but at one point there was only 1 server so it made things a little slow
Atmosphere: small cozy restaurant

I would definitely recommend this place but hopefully at a time when there is more than 1 server working."}
{"text":"Stay away. Sat down and waited at least 45 minutes and still did not get our food. Not to mention the group that came after us got their food first!  Waitress did not even serve tea unless we asked for it, and when I asked she told me to be quiet and wait LOL. Ridiculous. (was a middle aged Asian lady with glasses) Rude ASF. In  the end couldn't wait any longer so we left.
Would give this place negative rating if I could. Worst Service Ever experienced."}
{"text":"Price and quality of sashimi was well worth it.  Fish was very fresh.  If you come here you HAVE to get the sashimi!!!  If I was in the Richmond Hill, Aurora, or Newmarket area I would definitely come here for some sashimi.  Service was good.  Waitress always made sure ur tea cup was full.  Roll was decent nothing special. Roll was big with lots of cucumbers in it.  Fois gras unagi pressed sushi was nothing special (mostly unagi with a little bit of fois gras).  The rice for the sushi & roll kept falling apart.  So the rice doesn't stay together very well.  Once a lift up the sushi half the rice falls off.  Very clean bathrooms.  Overall pretty good experience.  Would return.

Sashimi 5/5
Sushi 3.3/5
Roll 3.8/5
Environment 5/5
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"We are a family of 4 and we love having their Ramen noodle soup!   Me and my wife would each have our Ramen noodle soup and the two kids would indulge themselves with the Dynamic rolls and California rolls."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I would say the quality is equal to food court type but in a sit down restaurant. Own by Chinese not Japanese. Portions are relatively bigger but I did not finish due to taste."}
{"text":"I had the Tonkotsu ramen, which was surprisingly good. Soup broth was flavorful and rich, with 2 reasonably sized soft pieces of chashu. Kelp instead of seaweed slices in the bowl, which was nice and the noodles were reasonably tender. Unfortunately, the Egg was cold, demonstrating that they just took this out of the fridge and placed it in the bowl (not good, should always be warm). My friend and I shared the Alaska roll, which the menu said would be spicy. Turns out it wasn't spicy at all lol. Torched salmon was indeed torched, but seemed to lack in flavour. Scallops as expected were small, but that's no big deal for this price. Overall, as far as I can tell, decent sushi."}
{"text":"Love it!  Been here many times and each time the fish is so fresh and yummy!  Highly recommend this sushi.  Best sushi in Aurora!"}
{"text":"This place is now my favorite sushi place in Aurora. Wow! The sashimi was fresh, the sushi was on point, even the chicken teriyaki was well can cooked. I'm glad they decided to make Aurora their home because we are coming back for sure! A delight for the foodies! Well done Izumi, well done!"}
{"text":"The sushi was bland and made with low cost materials. We don't understand why it can be priced at this range. We had a maki set and sushi set and God, we would rather have eaten from mall/grocery store sushi booth. There is better sushi joint in Aurora. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Damn...this is another case of personal greed.  I don't want to write about this place because it's like a block away from my house and I want it all to myself!  They just opened a few weeks ago and it's the real deal.  The ramen is up there with the best I've ever had.  The broth is outstanding and that's half the battle.  The sushi was very good too.  If I'm going to nitpick, the sushi rice was a tad mushy, but the quality is still top notch.  The tuna tataki was good, but missing maybe a citrus note and a bit more of a salty edge to make it great.  Overall, we'll totally be back...good service, decent prices and really, really good food.  Can't wait to try other stuff off the menu...like the tip says, they are in \"soft opening\" phase for dinner...so 25% off right now on dine-in."}
{"text":"Visited here on a weekday and really enjoyed the food. The restaurant was at max capacity for a good portion of my meal and we could tell they were struggling to keep up with how busy it was. They did apologize for the delay without us following up which I appreciated.

Food wise everything was excellent. The sushi was fresh and their rolls were carefully made and well presented. My favourite item was the Izumi roll which was a lightly torched roll.

The soy ramen was also delicious. The soup base was not too salty but full of flavor. The texture of the noodles was great too.

Definitely will go back to this restaurant and will be recommending this to friends!"}
{"text":"There are lots of mixed reviews, so I've decided to check it out for dinner last night :) 

I believe it is a Chinese-owned Japanese restaurant. Nice and simple Japanese decor inside. Attentive and friendly service - and yes, they did automatically refilled our tea just like Alfred A. had mentioned in his review ^^

First thing I did when I sat down was to order a can of Ikezo ($11.99) lol. Love this stuff - it is a sparkling sake with jelly inside - definitely a novelty when living in Aurora.

Sushi at Izumi is certainly NOT 'grocery store' sushi. C'mon, have you had the ones from T&T before? Those are awful. I can see that they have put a lot of effort coming up with those specialty signature rolls. I wanted to get the Tornado Roll but DC ordered the wrong one :( We ended up having a torched Izumi Roll (8 pcs for $17.99) with cucumber, snow crab, salmon and sea urchin. I wish there were a bit more sea urchin but overall quite tasty with a bit of a spicy kick to it. 

We also ordered a Deluxe 26 pcs chef choice sashimi dinner ($34.99) to share. It was beautifully presented on a long wooden platter - absolutely love the presentation. I also love the 11 variety of sashimi offered and they were fresh - totally worth getting :) The only one I didn't get to try was otoro, can't believe DC ate BOTH pieces without letting me have one -_- #ahole

Price is a tad much if you ask me but you do get the quality in the overall dining experience. One pet peeve I noticed was that one the sushi chefs did not wear a hat to keep hair in place while preparing food, another was wearing a winter toque - please kindly take note for food safety.

I would come back and try more items! Keep up the great work, Izumi. Yelpers, remember to check for their 15% discount dining in when you spend $50 before tax (excluding alcohol)."}
{"text":"A good find in a town like Aurora. First thing to impress me was the interior design of the place and its unique ability to detach you from the environment outside and preemptively signal your senses for the food you are about to try. I appreciate places that put a lot of thought into this. 

Food was definitely above average. Ordered the baked oyster ($6 for one, huge serving, excellent dish), tako wasabi (never seen any place be this generous with nori), Izumi roll and the saba pressed sushi. At this point I was gonna order more but our server stopped us saying weve ordered enough (explaining that pressed sushi is very heavy.) i appreciated this honesty because in the end, we struggled to fit the last few pieces in.

Only criticism is that the Izumi roll was a little bit too heavy on the mayo, and the saba pressed couldve used less rice."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the aurora neighbourhood. 

I have to first give a shout out to our server for the warm and friendly service she provided us. She was the only server of the night but didn't drop the ball once. She introduced us to the specials and popular items on the menu as well as took the time to explain the types of fish in our deluxe sashimi and sushi dinner.  Our tea was always refilled promptly and she checked up on us after every course to ensure everything is ok. 

Between the 5 of us, we orders the deluxe sashimi and torched sushi dinner, the black dragon roll, chicken yaki udon, fried tempera and ramen. All dinners were served with miso soup and a small salad.  The total bill camp up $122 with taxes and gratuity.  We got 15% discount because our bill was over $50, scorrrrre!  

Everything was very tasty and high quality. They import very unique fish directly from Japan that I've never seen or taste before so that was a real treat.  For dessert, We got to choose between a free scoop of mango or red bean ice cream. Perfect way to end a delicious meal. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New sushi place in Aurora. Overall very good! Price is reasonable and matches the quality of fish that is served - very fresh and a good variety.  The sushi rice isn't the best though, a bit dense. 

The service is fantastic, very attentive and friendly.  Got a party tray and tempura to share for two people and we both got soup and salad, which is a nice plus.  The tempura was friend very light and not too greasy. The party tray we ordered had sashimi, sushi and maki. Very good variety and great cuts and portion size for the fish.

Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"I was super excited that a sushi place would have a legit ramen in newmarket/aurora! I ordered the spicy ramen but when it arrived it was regular and not spicy or red at all like their pictures. My boyfriend ordered the regular ramen. (Definitely looked like the same ramen..) We also ordered spicy salmon maki rolls and there was someone's hair stubble on one of my rolls. The fact that they were sooooo nice I did not want to complain at all but that kind of sucked. The sushi was amazing! Melt in your mouth amazing! The ramen was so yummy! Despite that I like my food super spicy, the ramen was good! Place was super nice, nice ambience and you would never suspect such a chic place from an ugly plaza outside. Price is actually pretty expensive too."}
{"text":"Was coming back from collingwood and decided stop by here for dinner given it was on the way and had good reviews. Ended up being a disappointing experience.

Black cod ($12.99)
This was a really small piece for its price. The cod meat was not melt in your mouth kind of tender, and lacked flavor.

Foie gras and unagi pressed sushi ($19.99 for 10 pieces)
Presentation was nice. But I do gotta say you don't get much for what you pay for - definitely way too much rice than protien. At a glance you won't even notice the foie gras. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that a lot of it melted as it was torched. Tastes good, but not worth $20.

Izumi roll ($14.99 for 8 pieces)
Originally we were going to order the tuna story roll (spicy tuna roll) but saw that their Izumi roll had sea urchin for the same price so obviously we went for the better value roll. Turns out it was a bad idea. When we got the roll I saw absolutely NO sign of sea urchin. I asked the waitress showing her every single piece in the roll and she just says it's there and points at an orange dot claiming that was it. She then says \"it's not a lot, very little but it's there. I watched the chef put it in.\" And she walks away. Not pleased with that answer at all. Had we known there would be only a single sesame size of sea urchin in the roll we wouldn't have ordered it at all, and they call this their signature roll?! Essentially we paid $15 for a salmon California maki roll with mayo on top. For the record, the menu says it's snow crab inside but I can assure you it was imitation crab, definitely not snow crab. When we paid, the waitress said apparently sea urchin is not in season so they have very little to offer and they were going to take that roll off their menu, so to compensate she is going to offer 10% off. Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? You just reconfirmed that we got tricked. Appreciate the discount gesture but yelp check-in is 12% off when you order $50, and because she gave me this \"10%\" off, my meal was no longer under $50 before tax so I didn't get the discount...

Definitely not coming back.
I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 as the food tasted ok. It's just really expensive and I don't agree with how they run their business. All their rolls are over $15, with so little ingredients that they claim to have in it. There are definitely way better izakaya places with better quality and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"First time at this place and service was definitely on point. Felt very welcomed and didn't wait long for our food at all. The place is clean and simple, kinda small I wouldn't bring 20 people for a party because you wouldn't fit inside, but definitely a nice place for an intimate lunch or dinner. 

I ordered the spicy salmon maki roll which was amazing! The Ramen I didn't go crazy for but a great choice. I don't usually drink miso soup but there miso soup was great and clean washrooms! 

The menus were easy to read and there was a lunch menu which I loved to see, there's options you can choose from. Boxes or a la carte sushi

My overall experience was an amazing one. Had nothing negative to say about this place and will come back next weekend."}
{"text":"Please listen to the 1 or 2 stars reviews, I didn't, so here it is 1 star. It was a very hot day, and craving for Japanese food, not whole lot options in aurora area. I ordered sashimi dinner and spicy scallops maki roll. 

Sashimi diner: The fish wasn't good at all, tasteless, mushy, gross. I had couple pieces that's it. 
Spicy scallops: it was okay, covered a lot of spicy mayo. I will eat anything with mayo. 

The scary part is I had volleyball practice hour later, I was worrying I might get sick, imagine myself throw up in the gym or worse (you got the picture) thank god I was okay. Had a good time :) 

Besides my own craziness worried about food poisoning, this place was okay. 
p.s. is dog allowed in the restaurant? Someone brought a dog ( not a service dog ) with them."}
{"text":"Sushi Lunch Set ($13.99)

Great value as the ratio of rice to fish is high. You will be full with all these shari rice. Shari rice was cooked a little too mushy. Fish quality was OK. Not something I would recommend for a special trip but only when you are in the neighbourhood.

Maybe with all these 4/5 Star reviews I came with a high expectation?? Or just Lunch always not as good as dinner because the price is lower?

Izumi might be one of the Japanese restaurants that has the most diversify menu in Aurora for dinner. Worth coming if you lives in the area and don't want to drive too far.

Just stick with dinner.... I will say just passable for lunch."}
{"text":"Small, cute restaurant. I ordered the salmon terriyaki bento box $10 lunch.  The miso soup it came with didn't have a lot of flavor. My salmon was very salty. My friend ordered and enjoyed the omega-3 bento box. It came with fresh, thick slices of salmon sashimi and salmon maki and rolls. Service could be better."}
