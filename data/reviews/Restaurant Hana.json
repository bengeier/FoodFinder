{"text":"I ordered from Restaurant Hana recently when I realized I had access to a new Asian place that delivered!

The food was acceptable. As a control, I always order Broccoli & Beef the first time I eat anywhere that has it. The upside, the Broccoli was crisp and the beef was tender. The downside, there was significantly more oil than there should of been and so little sauce the food ended up tasting fairly unflavored.

I also acquired Beef Kushiyaki (Teriyaki Beef Skewers) and Yakitori (Teriyaki Chicken Skewers). The beef was significantly better flavored than the chicken and is worthy of praise, especially for the price. The chicken was acceptable, but for $1 dollar more I could move up to a simply better option.

Overall, I found the prices to be fairly reasonable (especially for Chinese delivery options in my area). The delivery driver was swift and called to let me know when he was outside.

I would consider eating here again, though I would not get my favorite entree of Broccoli & Beef."}
{"text":"Ive gotten take out from here a handful of times and its always been great. I usually get the hibachi chicken or beef and they give you a huge portion. Ive tried a few of the other typical asian dishes and everything ive ever gotten from here has been far above typical."}
{"text":"So disappointing! I went in during lunch time and ordered the hibatchi noodle. It is supposed to come with clear soup and they said they were all out of clear soup, offering nothing to replace it. Above the entrees it says \"all lunch entrees come with fried rice\" they bring out a plate of Lomein that they are calling \"noodle hibatchi\" no rice. The only vegetables in it are carrots.  This is NOT Hibatchi. And it came with no sauces! I ask if I am getting rice and they say \"that's a misprint on the menu\" ... Okay. My fiancé ordered General tsos, it was supposed to come with a crab Rangoon which they also didn't bring. I will definitely not be going back here. Ever."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get sushi in Pittsburgh. The Steelers and Crunchy Phillips rolls are a must have. We have tried several other places for sushi, but have yet to find one that compares."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere!! The house salad and eel cucumber roll were delicious. They make their ginger dressing in house. The food is reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have a sushi spot to pop into in Lawrenceville. We went in the late afternoon for an early dinner and were the only people there. The space is clean and the lighting is good- not too bright, but not too dim to read the menu. We tried the cooked sushi combo (eel, crab, and shrimp with a tempura shrimp roll), a California roll, the miso soup, and a chicken lettuce wrap plate. The sushi was delicious and well-prepared by their sushi chef and the service was quick. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of their great lunch prices for sushi combos and take-out often in the future. A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went to Hana last Friday and was pleasantly surprised with my experience.  Arriving, the server was pleasant and accommodating.  Took our beverage order and returned quickly.  We were then left alone for a few minutes to look at the menu being first timers.  The hot and sour soup was great as was my partners miso soup which lead to the calamari appetizer.  The breading was amazingly light and the calamari cooked perfectly.  The accompanying sauce was also very good.  I opted for the steak teryaki which came with a small side salad with a great Asian dressing.  Also included was fried rice.  My partner had the Happy Family which included pieces of lightly breaded chicken, shrimp and Asian vegetables and white rice.  We were checked on regularly, water was constantly filled and staff was always pleasant.
I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great sushi/sashimi bar as well as Asian dishes and entrees."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here for the first time. Very delicious. It is a little pricey but I think that's pretty normal for sushi!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant twice now. Once with Grubhub and after having issues with PayPal (not a fan) I opted to go \"old school\" and call directly. Both times the delivery was faster than told. The driver was polite and the food was hot like it came right from the kitchen in the restaurant. The food is absolutely the freshest and highest standard ingredients. The presentation is great and I will continue to get delivery anytime I have the hankering for Asian or sushi. Really great!"}
{"text":"came in for lunch on a friday afternoon and it was very quiet... hidden gem... had the seaweed salad and naruto roll and it was to die for. friends had sashimi lunch special and chicken with broccoli.  plenty of food and everything was delicious.  wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Hana is my first yelp review and for good reason!! My dining experience was perfect in every way...portion sizes, presentation, flavor, staff, etc. I can honestly say I've never had such prompt service. Our meals were served no more than 10 mins after we ordered! 

We had crab rangoons for a starter which were delicious and paired perfectly with their house-made duck sauce. The manager/owner brought us an appetizer of deep fried tofu with lettuce and jalapeños in a teriyaki sauce. Aside from the fact that this app was on the house, I absolutely loved it and will definitely order again! It's not something I would have ever tried but was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered the hibachi chicken, which was served with a ginger dressed salad & miso soup, all of which were amazing. I can't forget to mention the ginger dipping sauce which I legit poured all over my dish! So tasty!! My boyfriend ordered the Haiku roll & Tuna Mango roll. He raved about the tuna one and said it  was some of the best sushi he has ever tasted...and he eats a lot of sushi so that is a compliment for sure! 

Overall I would give this new restaurant 6 stars if it were possible. I highly recommend to anyone who is craving sushi or hibachi in the Lawrenceville area! Kudos to you Restaurant Hana, you will be seeing a lot more of me after this experience!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the sushi at all. Spicy tuna wasn't great quality and cucumber mixture in the rolls was kind of rubbery and made it hard to eat. Egg rolls aren't good and neither is the general tso"}
{"text":"Since moving to Lawrenceville I have been looking for a new place to get Chinese food, and I just found it. I got the general tso's lunch special with rice and wonton soup. The chicken was real chicken that's only lightly fried (which means you actually taste chicken and not just breaking and oil). Even better the sauce is actually spicy and the broccoli that came with it was crisp and fresh. The wonton soup was slightly salty, like it should be. The broth was clear with thin slices of green onions and the wontons tasted fresh and not mushy. I think they just put them in when I ordered. I will definitely be going back and trying much more of their menu."}
{"text":"I'm very pleasantly surprised.  Restaurant Hana seems to traffic primarily in takeout, as the restaurant was nearly empty but many, many takeout orders went out of the door.  The hot and sour soup was AMAZING - I will definitely go back/order just to have it again.  Bryan had kung pao chicken and I had udon noodles with beef, both of which tasted extremely fresh and as light as was possible, considering.  The staff was extremely friendly.

Not probably that great for a date, more like a quick meal with friends

{"text":"The boyfriend and I ordered take-out from Hana last night and our tummies were very pleased! We tried the Vegetable Gyoza, it comes in green pasta, which is totally fun. As well, we ate the California Roll (the BF isn't into raw food, yet), the Pittsburgh Penguins Roll, and the Naruto Roll. All were fresh, the flavors were tight and and I enjoyed every bite. He ordered the Chicken Hibachi with Veggies and Fried Rice. That kind of dish is usually passé for me, but I gotta tell you, it was savory and delicious. 

It is so nice and convenient to have a decent Asian restaurant within walking distance of my home, been too long! We will definitely be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"I ordered Hibachi and there wasn't enough food for the money, not even close. So, I called and complained to Jason. He showed up at my door with another order for free. The second order had two times the food that I received the first time. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the 1st time yesterday. We both ordered hibachi, I ordered chicken and noodles and he ordered a combo platter with chicken and shrimp. Staff worked quickly and were really friendly. The place was not packed however there were some people there. We did go on the early side though! The food came out quickly and it was yummy. Pretty standard hibachi, tasty and fresh. We did not try the sushi, they had a small sushi bar. Next time we will try it though, it looked very fresh. I think this place might be byob. I didn't see a drink menu. So I think it would be a great take out option for LV. My only complaints are there was no hibachi table and with our entrees we got salad that I did not eat because the lettuce looked like it had seen better days. We will try it again in the future though!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people who have not tried the food are leaving bad reviews, but this place is awesome! I've been to Hana at least a dozen times since it's opened and have never been disappointed.  My go-tos are the seafood Udon and the salmon hibachi.  The udon is delicious, tons of seafood and veggies. The salmon hibachi has enough fish to comfortably feed two people. Well worth the price.  

The rolls are great too.  The rainbow roll has a good sample of fresh fish and the spicy tuna roll is simple and delicious.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have been really happy with the food, service, and the space. They offer some great lunch options that are very affordable. I've tried sushi and hibachi steak - both awesome options, very fresh and well-presented."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch. The Hibachi Noodle with Chicken was nicely cooked, and had nice mellow flavors. I opted for the salad with my lunch, and while the salad had very fresh ingredients, I thought the ginger dressing could have had more flavor. (More ginger less carrot perhaps?)

Looking forward to going back and trying more items from the menu at a more relaxed pace. Love the curtains that have Jiji from Kiki's Delivery Service!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Sunday afternoon, on the way home from the symphony. My 10 year old was hankering for some oriental food.
We ordered a number of appetizers - the sushi sampler, salmon sushimi, beef and chicken served on sticks with a nicely seasoned sauce. I also got a small salad with their ginger dressing - very good dressing!. The restaurant was not busy...more folks coming in for takeout than seated. The food took a while to table, but we weren't in a hurry. 
It was pretty good. Decent food and certainly a step up from the normal 'Burgh formulaic oriental fare. The sushi was fresh and presented nicely. The final entre ordered, steak with udon noodles, was hot and tasty. My sometimes finicky son enjoyed the variety of tastes and had at it all with chopsticks, smiling. 
Price was very reasonable, service friendly...a good stop."}
{"text":"I took my fam here after the unpleasant discovery that La Gourmandine was not a sit-down place to eat brunch. Oh, well, already parked so off to the nearest place that served hot food with a place to sit--bingo. 

Wow, prices are high here. We came during lunch time but since it was Sunday, full dinner prices apply at like 1pm. Both my sister and I were fooled by the \"Hibachi Noodles\" which was just lo mein. My \"steak\" was just stir fried pork-looking beef. Also, lo mein is usually around $9, maybe $10 for beef, but it was a full $13 here. Hubby always orders the pricey sashimi at every Japanese place but even he was surprised at the tiny portion for $28. There were 8 pieces of fish on a skinny appetizer sized plate and a pile of clear noodles that you don't eat. That was a huge rip-off. We know what the sashimi dinner looks like at every Japanese restaurant and this is definitely the smallest portion yet for the same price. 

It really sucks that all Asian restaurants have their bento box and lunch specials only during week days. Don't they know those are my unhappy-eat-at-my-desk-and-read-emails days? They would make so much more money if bento boxes could be had EVERY day. 
Also, no parking lot so get ready to vie for a place on the crowded street. 

Skip this pricey joint and get the same Chinese/Japanese fare anywhere else."}
{"text":"Restaurant Hana is the epitome of average. Not bad, not great, and definitely not memorable. We came in for dinner tonight, a Friday evening, and were surprised to find we were the only customers in the restaurant while the rest of Butler Street was buzzing with nightlife. This didn't bother us as we often prefer quiet dinner settings, but the hostess proceeded to blare rap music from her phone the entire time we were dining. I enjoy rap as much as the next person, but the lack of professionalism was what caught me off guard. Our waitress was slightly awkward, and we could feel her intense stares piercing through us from across the room. Though, when it came to serving us, she was very diligent and efficient. 

Their menu offers a large variety of vegetarian options because almost every dish can be substitute in tofu as the protein. I ordered the General Tso's Tofu ($10), one of my all-time favorites. The tofu was fresh, but not very crispy. The sauce tasted fine in the beginning, but towards the end, it was clear that they made it a bit too sour. To top it off, they don't give nearly as much rice as they should and charge $2 for an extra scoop. Pure thievery! 

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai ($11) which he described simply as mediocre. He was especially not a fan of how wet the noodles were. Stay away from the Pad Thai, I guess."}
