{"text":"I figured the wait on a Sunday would be long and it was. 25-30 minutes turned into an hour for a table in the restaurant not a high top at the bar. Server was just ok. Never checked on us once to refill drinks until we were ready to leave. Probably because we didn't order beer. Wings were excellent. We ordered dry rub with 2 sides of sauce. Hubby's burger (Thick Rick) and fries were delicious - enough for 3 people! STAY AWAY from the Bay of Pigs Cuban pork sandwich. It was nothing like the sandwich described by the PD food editor. Unless you like 80% fat and gristle. It was gross... I'd definitely come back but stick with a burger or chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by Fat Heads for a relatively quick beer(s) and bite to eat. First off, the place is much larger than I anticipated. It's a pretty fun atmosphere and blends loud/energetic with casual very well. 

I ordered the Trail Pale Ale per the waiter's recommendation and it was great. For a second I had the Sunshine Daydream, which I've had before and really enjoy.The food was really good, almost unexpectantly so from a bar/grill. Ordered the onion rings to start which were done perfectly served with a somewhat spicy side sauce. For the main course I had the Brewben which was easily two meals in itself. Stacked with meat and nicely toasted.

All around great experience and will absolutely be coming back. The service is solid, price is right, beer selection is great and the menu is extensive...what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I did not arrive until 11 pm, but the place was dirty, bartenders were disinterested (more interested in watching the NBA game), and the bar smelled a little like barf. Made my way here because I thoroughly enjoyed my Pittsburgh FH's experience a few years ago. Didn't love the Cleveland version."}
{"text":"Came here with a regular who had been telling me for months how awesome it was. The menu alone is a dream come true for a foodie who's  into pub food like myself . An incredibly inspired and creative, deviation from standard bar/brewpub food. The \"headwiches\" which are described as \"a sandwich roughly the size of your head\" are a knockout! I got the Italian one, sorry I can't remember the name, but it was the best sandwich I've had in recent memory. I shared it, and my half was plenty of food. Overall the menu was very reasonably priced, and the portions are extremely generous, and indulgent. I also got to try the pierogi app which was 6 potato and cheese, deep-fried pierogies and a ramekin of sour cream. Very delicious and filling. Back to the Italian sarnie: if i can remember correctly, it had ham, capricolla, and salami, crumbled Italian sausage, hard boiled eggs, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, and a sundried tomato mayo. The bun was beautiful and the textures and flavors were a perfect match.  We also had the \"artery clogger\", which was a melt of sorts with ham and bacon and was another home run. Both sandwiches came with thick sliced housemade potato chips which were crunchy and delicious. I was excited to try the beer as I'm into local brews, and am a big IPA drinker. The IPA was not very complex. I'm a big hops fan and the beer nose was 100% big, piney hops, which I was happy about, but to me the beer was like hops flavored sparkling water. I finished it but opted for a Sierra Nevada the second time around. I also got to try the Christmas ale and the blueberry something or other that someone got. Ok, not great, but the beer list was pretty amazing. I'd totally keep trying their other beers when I return, but the food will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to Fatheads now for about 2 years.  Since we live right down the street we are able to go there quite often, which is both a blessing and a curse.  I absolutely love it! It is easily one of my favorite places.  I've had almost everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed.  You can't go wrong with any of the Headwiches or the pizzas.  They have these smoke house wings that are gigantic and this beastly BBQ sauce to smother them in that's out of this world.  I'm addicted to their chips and this sandwich called the Breuben (it's like a Reuben, but better).  There's defiantly a lot to choose from.
Fatheads isn't just about delicious food though.  They also have some of the greatest local beers.  I especially like their Headhunter IPA and I think that their Christmas ale rivals Great Lakes.  They have a kind of beer for everyone, from Belgians to stouts, even some Iambics.  The atmosphere is cool, unless you go in there on a weekend night and it's madhouse with a two hour wait for a table.  Their only downfall is the parking lot.  It's way too small for the capacity of the place.  On a busy night you'll end up trekking from the Drug Mart parking lot.
I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First time at Fat Heads. I went in a large party and they accommodated us well. I stepped outside of my Paleo and Gluten Free diets for this place.

For an appetizer we had the Headhunter Onion Rings. Excellent! The breading is made with one of their award winning IPA's and a little spicy-- okay a lot of spice. They are very tasty, with an extra kick from the horseradish dipping sauce.

Everybody's entrees were great with no complaints from our 15+ people. I had the Brisket Sandwich which was the size of my head... Literally and figuratively. The lady had the Fat Italian. Both excellent choices. Order the brisket with extra sauce for more enhanced flavor. The sandwiches are accompanied with a heaping portion of really good homemade chips.

The beers are definitely award winning. I had the bumbleberry beer and tasted a few samples of the others on the extensive beer menu. I can't wait to try the others.

The only downfall is the place is SUPER loud. Almost headache loud. 
 The Reese's Pieces Bread Pudding wasn't worth writing home about.

Definitely a must go if you're in the area. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This review is not based on a particular dining/drinking experience, but rather a general review based on the combined 20-30 times I've been to Fat Head's since I discovered it a few years ago.  This is without question my favorite place to drink in the Greater Cleveland area.  This place is always crowded, however its very large on the inside, and you rarely have to wait long to get a table or a seat at the bar.  This place is all about the beer - I'm a home brewer and craft beer snob and can honestly say Fat Head's makes the best beer in the world.  No matter how many times you visit, there are always a few new styles on draft.  The food is comparable to Melt - gigantic portions of creative pub food.  I've no particular complaints about the food, but be aware this place is famous for the quality of its beer, not its food.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"If they let you switch chips for fries I would be there all the time! As it is, I end up at two other places that are happy to do so, (which is a shame because Fathead's sandwiches are awesome and I love their beer sampler.). Oh well, maybe someday......."}
{"text":"Very nice brewpub atmosphere. The smokehouse wings are excellent, charred with a variety of sauces to choose from. I had a sampler of beers from the rotating draft list. Samplers were $1.50-$2.00 on average for most selections. Portions are huge so show up with a group!"}
{"text":"I can't want to Saturday evening at about 6 PM. We walked right in and was immediately seated. The menu was huge and had tons of options. The bathroom was very clean! The set up was nice spacious. I tried the Pear Cider Ale, very lite and refreshing. For appetizers we tried the nachos The stuffed mushrooms and the smoked wings! Everything was hot and amazing! Everything was seasoned perfectly! For dinner we ordered a fat Italian, a triple bypass, and the fish and chips, and a order of wings and fresh cut fries. Everything was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are very lucky to have this high quality of a brewery in our backyard of the Cleveland suburbs. The beers are brewed in two rooms right by the bar, you can see the brewers in action which is very interesting. You will never be disappointed by their house beers (haven't seen the other non fatheads beer they have on tap.) The have great food and excellent service. I have not been to their middleburg location, but I heard its just as pleasing. If you live for craft beer, especially local, this is your place to be!"}
{"text":"I'd had their beers around town before but I finally went to the \"saloon\". It was much more open and spacious than I expected. Lots of people and moderately noisy, but I had no trouble moving around or hearing my booth-mates.

My girlfriend and I met up with 2 friends who already had a table. Unfortunately they had waited 45 minutes to get it, Thursday ~7pm. They didn't seem too happy about that.

However the menu was big, the service was timely, and the beers were great. Actually the menu was almost too big. I finally decided on the cheesesteak sub due to the superlative description. It was surprisingly fresh and non-greasy. However the taste was a bit bland, and honestly with a cheesesteak I was actually hoping for a little bit of grease. For some reason they would only give me potato chips (fries were ~$4.50 more!) even though my buddy got fries with his burger. Thankfully the chips were good, thick-cut and extra-crispy but not burnt at all. Also got the blueberry cheesecake bread pudding, which was awfully good but could have used some actual blueberries instead of just sauce drizzled on top.

The highlight is really the beer. They brew a full spectrum from hoppy to sweet, from thick to refreshing. I tried the Milk Stout which was the creamiest beer I've ever tasted, and the Sorcerer was a respectable dark Belgian strong ale. A friend had some kind of summer IPA that was crisp and fruity. All delicious!

I might go back if I know I can avoid that long wait for a table. Otherwise I think I'll just buy their beer at a local shop."}
{"text":"You gotta love Fat Heads!  Not only is their food delicious, but it is a fun place to visit!  Eighteen of us went there last night for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful time, although our wait was lengthy!  We got there at 5 p.m. and sat down to look at the menus at 6:25 p.m.!  Their Aloha chicken sandwich with their homemade chips was yummy, as well as their green peach iced tea.  The pulled pork burrito was a hit with a few of my family members, while others enjoyed their pizzas.  The birthday celebrant enjoyed sharing her bread pudding dessert with all of us, a nice perk compliments of Fat Heads!  It was a fun time with excellent service!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and decided to try as it was close to where I was working. Went on a Monday night and it was very busy but no wait. Impressed with the size of the place; incredibly large for a brewpub. Ordered some teriyaki smoked wings and the hogzilla sandwich. The rub on the wings and the smoke flavor were excellent; definitely recommend. The hogzilla (pulled pork) was very good as well. Split a sampler of beers with a friend and closed the evening with a couple of the imperial stouts. Good beer, good food. Service was also very good. Will definitely go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Best breaded mushrooms a large portion plenty to enjoy and share"}
{"text":"This place was awesome... huge bar/restaurant with games in back.  Very family friendly.  Great food, portions huge.  And the best part... the blueberry beer was amazing!!  Ended up buying a growler to take home on my way out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was perfect. Tv was huge and beer was great. I had the wings and grilled cheese and both were straight fire . Lol this place made my day"}
{"text":"Great food.  We had buffalo calamari - yum!  Good service!  The bumbleberry beer was refreshing and the IPA was rich and flavorful.  The one negative was the acoustics - maybe some alteration to the ceiling would allow for conversation.  We will return with the whole family as the kids will like it too!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner at this brewery.  I was not impressed - at all!  I guess I should have known when walking in at 7pm on St. Patrick's Day and immediately being seated that this wasn't going to be a great experience.  The atmosphere was rather dull and did absolutely nothing to add to the experience.  Boooorrrriinnngggg.

The food was average at best....and certain items were just plain bad.  One member of our party ordered the onion rings which were delivered to our table a nice shade of...hmmmm....what's the best word??  BURNT!  I guess that wasn't too bad because at least it gave them some flavor (which was missing in any other form.)  Another member had grilled cheese.  Fat Head's tries to make this pretty basic sandwich \"adult\" by slapping on some goat cheese.  It doesn't work...back to the drawing board chef!  The sandwich was average.  The potato chips as well.  They didn't have any sort of distinguishing characteristic.  Just boring.  The \"kid\" of the group ordered a pepperoni pizza.  This should at least be decent, right?  I mean, it's a simple pizza!  WRONG!!  As someone said, it tasted like frozen pizza.  But, not DiGiorno (hat tip to Joe Tate).  No, this was Tony's.  Most of it was taken home to the dogs.  

I can't really comment on the beer since I stuck to Guiness on this glorious St. Patty's Day.  Other members of my party said it was decent.  

The service was good.  The one good part of the evening.

All in all, I will not go back...even if you pay me.  My belly hurts just thinking about it.  With all of the wonderful dining choices in the Cleveland area, this is a definite waste of space in my opinion.  If you are looking for a fun brewery with good food stick with Great Lakes!"}
{"text":"Beer Selection is great. Food selection is great. Staff is generally great. Overall, I love this place. Has something for everyone. I head here.

Only problem I have with this place is that it generally is loud and gets louder which isn't a big deal and there's typically a wait around dinner. Both minor issues."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a tribe game. It was pretty busy but service was excellent at the bar. Tried the smoked wings and the were awesome. Beer is great. Love the Bumbleberry! Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, incredible beer. The kitchen sometimes misses out on special requests, so if you make one, be sure to check your food carefully before digging in!"}
{"text":"Out of town guy here. First off this place was awesome. One of the local recommend to me since I love craft beer. Got here super selection choice of local brewed beer and it was great.  I had the class Ruben sandwhich and went perfect with my beer.  Definitely go during happy hour which ends at 7pm  dollar off of all draft. Oh if you like spicy stuff as for their in house spicy sauce.  A good heat to it. 


Ps awesome customer services"}
{"text":"On a snowy day in Ohio, I walked Into the brewery/restaurant and was greeted by a smiling staff, and the delightful smell of food. I knew I was in for a treat. I ordered myself a bumblelberry (blueberry with notes of lemon and hops) and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh blueberries floating around my beer. Browsing the menu was a daunting task. There was so many options (all of which were calling my name), I eventually decided on the Bay of pigs with chips. 
It was an amazing combination of sweet and spicy.
I was a tad nervous when reading the description that the sauce would be too spicy to enjoy, but I was proven wrong. While having a kick, it had a very good and deep flavor.  The waiter was very good, the food was outstanding, and of course the beer is the icing on the cake. I will be back to conquer the whole menu! A must for foodies and beer snobs alike."}
{"text":"Went to Fatheads with a group of people and we all ordered lots of food and appetizers.  Many ordered the hamburger.  The meat must have been the cheap ground meat because they found gristle.  The meat had no taste to it either.  It was the worse hamburger I had ever had.  A friend of mine ordered a fish sandwich and it happened to be one of the only things that tasted good there besides the beer.  I know that we all want to save money but sometimes quality goes along way.  None of us have been back or will ever go back.  When you have a great concept as Fat Heads, you need to make your food exemplary with great taste because it makes a big difference in the end.  Word of mouth can either make you or break you.  I think people who go there get numb from alcohol and don't really taste what they are eating.  It's my opinion and of my group also."}
{"text":"Lovely wife and I had dinner at FH Tuesday night and we won't be going back any time soon. It's definitely not our style of food but we found a couple promising items. Our wings were dry and had very little flavor, wife's salad had some rotten lettuce and my chicken sandwich was small with dry meat.  The server seemed pissed off too.  I guess I can see the attraction here but I hoped for better food."}
{"text":"I love Fatheads! The sandwiches and burgers are all great, I've tried probably 7 of them at this point. The spicy Cuban sandwich is my favorite, I'd only recommend it if you can handle some heat. Portions are always huge as well, I often take half a meal home. The beer is always good too, I love trying all of their seasonal rotating beer. Their Sunshine Day Dream is one of my favorites there. Check out this place if you haven't."}
{"text":"8 pm, Saturday night. It was packed and we waited 50 minutes for our table as Fat Head's first timers. I am a big Bumbleberry fan and have had a variety of their beers which I've all enjoyed, so I was excited to come here. Very open, family friendly (read: kids screaming and running everywhere underfoot) and all beer making equipment is in plain sight. 

The restaurant itself is quite large, much bigger than I thought it would be. Pretty casual, unpretentious environment that quite loud, which I enjoy. I ordered a Jungle Juice ale, which I was not especially satisfied with. Don't get me wrong, it tasted great- but if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between GLBC's Elliot Ness and the Jungle Juice. I might as well have ordered a Bud Light for the originality factor. D. ordered the Duke of Lagerfest which was clean, crisp and delicious- would definitely reorder.

As someone else said, come here for the beer and do not expect great food.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. Expect Panini's/Cleats quality, with the exception of their wings. We ordered garlic parmesan and smoked bbq wings, both of which were excellent. D ordered quesadillas (not good at all- cheese was not melted, altogether was rushed) and pulled pork chili cheese fries. Now I realize chili cheese fries are not the epitome of health, but the sheer amount of oil that was contained within the fries was unheard of. No doubt due to being busy and quick fryer turnover, but regardless we were disappointed. 

Our waiter Chandler was hilarious. He had one liners for days and was the perfect mix of attentive, witty, and didn't hover. You go, Chandler. 

Overall, was it worth the wait? Go here for good wings and great beer, and don't expect to have your mind blown from food quality. For me, Dina's still reigns supreme."}
{"text":"Your classic brewery restaurant doing it right. On a Friday night we were told it was a 45 minute wait but ended up only waiting 15 minutes or so. Grabbed some beers and mixed drinks. High praise on the Moscow mules and my Head Hunter IPA was excellent along with the Hippy Sippy was a clear winner. While we were waiting someone from the kitchen came out and offered us a sample of wings on an order they messed up. What a great idea and awesome sampling of a huge wing that simply got seasoned wrong!

I have never had calamari buffalo flavored rings but these were amazing. The cod father was enormous and enough for two alone but the fish was flaky and fresh. 

I have a long list of beers to try from them still so I will be back and their beers aren't distributed locally to us. Their concept is funny and translates well to food and their theme. Thanks for making a fat head out of me."}
{"text":"Having limited access to some of their bottles here in Indy, I wasn't sure if I'd like their beer much. An in-person visit sold me though. Noteworthy foods: Onion Soup (Seriously I can't say enough good things about this soup-it was AMAZINGLY yummy!) The Parma Karma was good and a perfect pairing with lots of beer samples. Beer faves: Spooky Tooth, Trail Head and IBUsive IPA. Went home with a growler of Trail Head Pale Ale. Bar seating was loud and crowded, due to the football game, but we had no issues getting seated and our waitress was attentive and nice. Woot!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the foods that my friends and boyfriend ordered were good (pizza, burger and grilled cheese) but my veggie sandwich was just okay.  The portions are huge so I took half of my sandwich home where I found a hair in it the next morning.  Definitely not happy.  I would give them a higher rating if not for the hair.  I would probably try it again, but would double check my food or just drink beer."}
{"text":"Love this place....  The foods are amazing...  Tried many different sandwiches and all are Great !!!!"}
{"text":"I had been here the other day and loved it. So I told my co workers who were arriving from out of town we should eat here. Walked in with a party of twenty on a Wednesday. Front desk thought I was joking until they walked in behind me. They said forty five minutes and we could grab a drink at the bar. We grabbed a round and less than half way through our beers we were seated. Food was great, buffalo calamari makes me happy, BEST ONION RINGS IVE EVER HAD! Then we just ran through the beer samples, a couple bucks at most for some of these beauties?!! Sign me up! My server last week was Dale and he was super accommodating with split checks, and tonight we had heather and she was also awesome. Only downside... Y'all aren't in California. But thanks for making my stay in Cleveland amazing. 


Also the prices here are super friendly, especially when the portions are that huge. Well done fat heads!!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Fat Head's for the first time. It was a very pleasurable experience. The atmosphere and design are great. It feels very open. Lots of seating and tons of bar space. I had the DLA sandwich, served hot, and it was delicious!  Holy smokes, the Hop Ju ju is excellent. If you like the head hunter, you'll love that one. Make sure to get a headwich if you're going to be drinking a few of their \"head\"ier beers!"}
{"text":"Delicious margarita pizza! Didn't realize it came with goat cheese.  

Nice place to sit outside and chill."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I've waited so long to try Fat Head's!  I think I was secretly or subconsciously protesting the demise of Danny Boy's market and avoiding going here.  That was clearly a mistake and thankfully, I've corrected it.

Our meal started off with a pint of the Blueberry Ale.  Great aroma and subtle blueberry taste.  The fresh berries floating in the beer were a bit strange, but as I bit into one, it totally worked with the beer.  And, they kept rising and sinking in the beer like a lava lamp, so that was pretty cool.  

My second pint was the house Hefeweizen and was delicious.  Subtle hints of cloves and banana made this perfect.  

My sidekick and I split an order of Smokhouse wings and they were tremendous. Whole wings, drums, the other part, and the tips are all attached.  They were meaty, with a rich, smoky flavor, and a zesty sauce. 

I decided on one of the sandwiches, appropriately called \"Headwiches\" as they really are the size of your head.  I selected the Paul's Pro Pastrami, a great combo of nice, fatty pastrami with hot sausage, a fried egg, cheese, onions, pickles and a zippy mayo, all on a bun that was reminiscent of a Mexican \"torta.\"  Nice crust, soft inside, but it doesn't fall apart or suffer from \"sloopage\" (a Sniglet for when the food falls out of the bun) as you eat it.  The house-made crisps on the side were crunchy and salty and the perfect side.

The bar area is very nice with enough TV's so you can watch the game, but for some reason, there was no audio.  They were playing the \"K-Tel Soft Rock Classics\" collection or something like that...not sure what's up with that.  The dining room is very big, lots of tables, all within viewing distance of TV's as well, but I was surprised at the huge amount of kids running around.  It's a bar, people!  Take your kids to Chuck E. Cheese, for crying out loud!  

Fat Head's is a great place!"}
{"text":"The beer here is top notch...the food?  m'eh....first of all...I wish places would stop serving chips as their main side...I realize it's cheap...but when you bite into them and they're either soggy or burnt (sometimes in the same order), you realize how cheap they are.  

Second, smoke your wings longer...they should pull off with ease...I shouldn't have to worry about them flying away when I'm trying to separate them...and lastly...shrink the menu...it's always better to do a couple things well as opposed to a million things just ok.

location is great...building is beautiful... but once again...top notch beers...just m'eh food...."}
{"text":"Come earlier than later cuz parking fills up quick. Great portions, bold tastes, awesome wings ... and good brews!"}
{"text":"Their Head Hunter IPA rocks. Piney, with a grapefruity finish.  Their guest beer list is awesome, and it changes every time I visit. The smokehouse wings are superb, and the Fatwiches are great.  I've been there 5 times and the food gets better each time."}
{"text":"I have drove by this place a million times and never once thought to stop until we were invited to a friend b-day party. All I can say is WOW! will be back with the rest of the family.  Great place to eat and have a good beer."}
{"text":"My first time at Fat Heads - this place is huge! And now I know why it's always busy. They're food is amazing! I ordered the fish and chips which was super good. My husband got the wings- wow. I wish I had ordered those!! I'm not normally a wings person but these were out of this world. Perfectly smoky and grilled. Not greasy at all. I can't wait to go back and get my own wings! Service was great too! Even for a busy night."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY! The beers are excellent. We have a flight of delicious beers fir only $13.50!  The menu is extensive and well paired. The atmoshpere and design is well plannef and efficient. The service is excellent. All around a great place to visit. Prices are good, portions are large. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Great beer.  Food is good, but pretty heavy (even for bar food).  Great for large groups, but it get's pretty loud at times.  Indoor and outdoor seating, TVs and game room give you options.  I'd go there more often but it's a drive from my house.  The tasting room in Middleburg Heights (at their production brewery) is really cool.  TV's minimal kitchen, Saturday tours of the brewery, and they have a gift shop.  Overall worth the trip."}
{"text":"Place is boss..  Might need a doggie bag.   This is a solid 5/5."}
{"text":"Great beer, decent food, stupid policies.

Fat Heads is a great place to grab a beer and wings with friends. The beer selection is solid with many great in-house brews and a solid list of guest beers. The smokehouse wings are also absolutely fantastic. I've found myself going here just for these wings on many occasions.

The rest of the food menu is only decent. The appetizers are generally far too large unless you have a group, nothing here is sized appropriately for one person. The sandwich platters also suffer from the same issue, gigantic portions at higher prices due to their size. The quality of the sandwiches and apps are also only good. One or two shining stars but much of it is average.

My biggest criticism of this place is the stupid potato policy that they even took the time to print on their menu. Obviously you printed it there because complaints would be at an all time high otherwise. In what Bar and Grill today can you not substitute French fries or chips or a healthier option whatsoever? If Fat Heads wanted to charge a dollar for a substitution they would collect a lot of dollars (in my opinion). Instead, someone's pet peeve becomes no choices for the customer.

3 stars."}
{"text":"Fat heads is hands down one of my favorite places to go for a burger ! They have an extensive menu with many options to choose from both food and beverage wise. I always request Branden as a server when I done ! He is very welcoming, funny, attentive, and knowledgable about the menu. He always makes great recommendations. If we can't have him as a server, we will return another time ! Great place to dine with friendly service!"}
{"text":"Made the trip from Columbus and it was so worth it.  Great selection of their own amazing beer, with some limited release offerings. Solid guest beer list as well. We had wings and let me warn you- they are ginormous!! They are full leg/wing sections, and delicious. The rest of the menu looked impressive, wish we had room for more.  Surprisingly large bar/ restaurant space, decent parking, attentive bar staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fix the parking for a fourth star. Since you are based out of Pittsburgh, you will never get a fifth star .  

Love the beer. Food is also good, but secondary to me since I'm basically an over achiever when it comes to assaulting my liver. 

The damn parking lot probably couldn't fit enough cars even if it wasn't shared with an entire plaza. For that reason, I avoid this place like the plague. But I still buy the beer in the stores. 

Your product is good, but it's hard to get. 

Go Browns."}
{"text":"Why the steps out front. I'm drunk. How do you expect me to walk down those. Jeez Louise."}
{"text":"I have been to Fat Head's several times and it is my go to place for when I have company in Cleveland from out of town.

The building is huge, as well it should be, because it use to be a farmers market and they give tribute to this with a wall of pictures and a small history.

Fat Head's is foremost a brewpub. When you work through the front door the first thing that hits you is the smell of the hops and mush from the brew process. The large bar is on the left with plenty of room to sit and have a drink or two, maybe three.

This place is great for large parties, as they have massive tables that easily seat 10 or more people with plenty of room. The menu is large as well, with something for everyone. They have their signature  headwich, which is simply a large sandwich that is one of the best I have ever had. If you plan on getting a salad be warned that they are also massive. Everything about this place pays tribute to the name Fat Head's because everything is so large and it will go to head as one of the best places to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The The pulled pork chili was awesome as well as the smoked wings. Lots of beers on tap I liked everything I tried"}
{"text":"Bottom line up front: friendly and original brewpub with outstanding beer and tasty food.  I hope Clevelanders recognize and appreciate the good fortune of having Fat Head's in their 'hood.

Passing through the Cleveland area, I visited Fat Head's for dinner on a recent Friday night.   I had two great cask-conditioned, brewed-on-the-premises beers -- a smooth chocolatey porter and a super-hoppy IPA.  Food consisted of a tasty and generously-sized taco salad featuring home-made potato chips.   

The service at the bar was friendly and responsive.  Fat Head's is worth visiting.  Along with Bar Cento in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland and Feve's bar in Oberlin, Fat Head's is on my list of NE Ohio food and drink experiences which I would recommend to anyone (especially those old enough to drink the beer).  

update: back again for dinner on 10/21/11 on a road trip and visit with friends: Fat Head's is still a major keeper!  The beers were fresh and interesting -- the list is amazing.  Buffalo chicken salad was tasty and ample.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The draft beer selection here is great. Try the bumbleberry or any others they make there. Food is good but sometimes the fries are a bit overlooked. Unfortunately fries only come with burgers. The pretzel sticks or loaded cheese fries are both good apps although a bit overpriced for what they are."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great micro-brew and grub place, look no further!  Agree with John B. below on the portions, they are huge!  I've eaten at both here and Great Lakes and there's not even a competition (food wise).  Everything I've tried on Fathead's menu is incredible, the beer selection is awesome and for any pallet."}
{"text":"Had a great night out at Fatheads! We were seated quickly for a party of 12 and our server was totally on his game. All our food came out hot and was delicious! The servings are GINORMOUS so if you are going to eat and not just drink then maybe you'd better fast for a day or two ahead of time! 

I had the Bumbleberry Beer which is a smooth brew with low undertones of blueberry and the mellow sweet flavor of honey, served with a few blueberries bobbing in my glass. For dinner I had the Prime Dip; prime rib thinly sliced in some crusty brioche, melted provolone, mushrooms and onions along side a hefty serving of home style potato chips, seasoned with salt and pepper.

Altogether a thoroughly enjoyable evening with our friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a solo venture to Ohio and knew I had to hit up this place. It is sports bar, brewery, and home to ridiculously large sandwiches - three things with which I can easily fall in love, but be super critical about as well.

Fat Heads did not disappoint. Though busy, I got a seat at the bar and was greeted almost immediately. The tap list was extensive, with not just Fat Heads beer but a nice, varied selection of other beers too. I nearly fell out of my seat when I saw they had FFF Gumballhead on tap and, given my irrational fear of kegs kicking before I get to sample, I ordered that first.

The menu was just as extensive as the beer list, but I knew I had to go with the special: kielbasa, pierogies, mustard, Swiss, and kraut - all on one hero roll. Given the location just outside Cleveland, I knew it would be done right, and many of the ingredients were locally sourced. The sandwich was a behemoth and I didn't even get through half of it, but it was very good. All the components of the sandwich somehow balanced each other out despite being a total gut bomb. Homemade chips were tasty.

My tab with the sandwich and  three or four beers was incredibly cheap - I don't think I paid more than $30. As someone who's used to NY/NJ prices, it felt like highway robbery! 

I love visiting my friends in Cleveland, but now this will be my excuse to return.

When you go, don't forget to get your four-packs of Head Hunter or fill your growler!"}
{"text":"Great. Tons of tasty beers, and the food is really good.  The menu is huge and I've never heard a complaint about a single dish.  My personal favorite would be the killer flavored smoke house wings.  Solid level of heat and the smokiness of the wings is top notch."}
{"text":"We have friends in the Cleveland area that brought us to Fat Head's when we were there visiting them last month.  No one was drinking so this review is only for the food and service.

There were four of us.  Orders were 1 Twisted Brisket, a Bay of Pigs (mine), Prime Rib Bacon Club and an order of wings with potato chips.  Everyone thought the food was good.  My Bay of Pigs (just lots of porky goodness!) was good.  The seem to make their own potato chips, which we really liked.  The portions were large and no one left hungry.  

The ambience was similar to something like a Buffalo Wild Wings - maybe a bit nicer than that.  The dining area was large and they also had a large bar area. 

The food was good, not great, but overall it is a place we would go to again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The fried calamari blew my mind away and I was quite pleased with the huge selection of burgers."}
{"text":"Wings! Wings! Wings!!! Go with the beasty BBQ Smoke house wings or the parmesan buffalo style wings."}
{"text":"The beer selection is 5 stars. The food is...eh. The smoked wings are good but not much else. They really need to step up the menu to include meals that represent quality over quantity. Whenever I browse the menu for something that sounds appetizing, I feel like I'm choosing what kind of heart attack I'd prefer. I mean, I love some fried food but not everything needs pulled pork or buffalo chicken on top. I would love lighter, or even tastier menu options so that I can save room for more Fatheads beer!"}
{"text":"While out of town on business we tried this place and we're not disappointed.  The sandwiches could feed multiple people.  Will defiantly make this a must stop every trip.  The beer selection is insane and all we tried were awesome."}
{"text":"I'm confused. I'm sitting here in bed after having drinks and dinner there tonight. While the bumbleberry beer was good and the server was friendly, I probably wouldn't go back.

The food just wasn't good, and I'm generally put off by large portions. It's not funny or appetizing watching 300 lb people gorge themselves on sandwiches the size of their heads made of subpar ingredients. With amazing markets and options for purchasing meat in this city, maybe I just expect better.

The smokehouse wings had very little meat on them and were cold by the time I got through 3 of them. My friend's hamburger looked like prison meat. We all ended up bloated and none of us actually even came close to finishing our meals.

The atmosphere reminded me of the Walmart of breweries. Get some character or something.

Sigh. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Good food ,there seems that the employee's were out on the outside deck and drinking. That would be a great place to work. I hope no one gets a Dui on the way home"}
{"text":"Went here after escape room Cleveland and love the food they have to offer here. Just great I recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Great food and beer. Customer service was friendly as well. Recommend calling ahead in the evening to avoid the wait. Recommend to patron this establishment if you find yourself in the area. The only thing I found disappointing was the shirt selection for sale to take home as a souvenir. First it was disorganized and second the designs were poorly created."}
{"text":"Outstanding. 

My wife, daughter, and I were in the area for an art show, and were sort of rambling around looking for a place to eat. Having tried their beer before, we spotted fat head's and decided to stop in. 

What a pleasant surprise. The food, traditional American fare, was excellent. The beer was fantastic (though I did just have the one glass of their session IPA), and the environment was family friendly. 

The service was excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. It is a superior example of what is possible with a tavern restaurant."}
{"text":"Fat Head's is a chain that takes on the quirks of the city it's in.  The Cleveland one (in suburb, North Olmsted, OH) is in what used to be Danny Boy's, a large produce market.  It was a staple and most in the area were sad to see it go so it's nice that Fat Head's displays some nostalgic items from Danny Boy's past.

The place is huge and is well known for its beer selection.  The food might appear to be pricey but the quantities are enormous.  Hence one of the burger names, \"The Artery Clogger\".  Take half home or share - or clog your arteries.  Even the salad I once got was \"as big as my head.\"  Another time I went I got the \"Parma Karma\" which is off the appetizer menu.  It is PLENTY for a meal.  Parma, a suburb of Cleveland is known for its Polish delicacies.  mmmm perogies.

I enjoyed the clever meal names, whether they were based on the extreme size of the meal or Cleveland fun facts."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Love the Parma Karma, pizzas and well pretty much the whole menu. We drink the Goggle Fogger which goes great with the Parma Karma. Great service and the staff really gives you a great education on beer selection. Top notch joint."}
{"text":"Love the beer...but the food is very average to below average. But who's going there for the food??!! Bumble Berry bear is incredible."}
{"text":"It's one of the sad and unfortunate realities of life for us left coasters....   As you travel east, the quality of food gets better with each passing mile. 

Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon does not disappoint. This is my first trip to Cleveland. And while I don't have an overwhelming desire to return any time soon (no offense middle America), if I do, Fat Head's will be on my \"must visit\" list. 

The Beer
This is a microbrewer that's producing some very unique, interesting, and flavorful beers. I had blueberry ale that was complete with fresh blueberries swarming around in the bustle of carbonated bliss. It's not overly fruity, nor does the ale fade into the background when consumed with spicy BBQ. Rave reviews were abundant around our table for several of the other brews.

The Food
This place makes the little fat girl inside of me squeal with delight. Deprive yourself of food for a few days leading up to your visit...and live off of the gross excess for a wee after. All of the portions are HUGE. 

We started off with a variety of appetizers...wings, onion rings, mushrooms, etc. While I'm not into deep fried slimy things, I did sample the wings and rings. Both are outstanding. The wings are treated to a dry rub, smoked, and then grilled to perfection.

I had the Twisted Brisket sandwich, which was the size of a Cadillac. Not a Cadillac of today...but the Boss Hog of Cadillacs. The fresh bun was piled high with crispy onions, perfectly cooked brisket, a fried egg, and cheddar cheese. Your cardiologist will love this! On the side....a heaping pile of homemade chips. 

The Service
Our waiter had a great attitude and sense of humor. Drink cups never reached the bottom, sauces were aplenty, a towering pile of napkins were at our disposal, and we never wanted for anything. Good job, Fat Head's crew!

My only complaint and suggestion...open one of these in southern California. Please open it just far enough from my home to allow for an occasional visit, but not so close that I'm there nightly. After all, that would require a new (and much larger) wardrobe."}
{"text":"We had the smoked wings. Huge. Would have been better if they got the sauce right. We made it a point to say my friend could not do spicy. It was suggested we get the smoky bbq, what came out, after we tried it, was some orange, vinegar and pepper flavored sauce. We both ate one and realized no way is this bbq. We were not offered a new set of wings, we were not comp'd only an insincere sorry and \"it might be the medium or  chipotle?\"the server didn't know which flavor she put it or what came out. 
I have the beauty and beasty, again portion is huge. And it was not bad. Wasn't the best pulled pork I ever had, but you'd have to be bad to mess up pulled pork.
I finished it off with the bread pudding. Came out hot but also very dry and burnt. I could not eat it and the server seemed offended I did not want to take it with me. 

I bought a shirt and some beer in growlers to bring back home. I realized when I got home, I did not receive the 10% discount in the gift shop, the 3 dollar discount on growlers (thought this happens M-W) and I was given the incorrect shirt size. 

Just an overall sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last month. The place was packed. I wish there was better sitting area during our wait. It was raining, so everyone was inside. The menu was vast. My food was pretty good. I can't wait to go back to try something different."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i decided that instead of our usual beer bar options we would try something new, and boy were we glad we did! 

Fat Heads is located in a huge building in the suburb of north. there was a wait on a friday night, so we decided to grab some beers at the bar while we waited. the bar staff while busy made sure to give me eye contact to let me know that they knew i was there, after i ordered my beers (which were fantastic by the way) and paid with my credit card, they made sure to make note of my name on the card and thank me BY NAME when she gave me the receipt to sign. it really is the little things that make the entire experience better. 

our waitress also was very personal and eager to make suggestions and opinions on the menu and beers. the food is well priced and HUGE! the sandwiches are gigantic and so are the burgers. the wings, while a little expensive are on the larger size and the sauces are quiet good. 

We went there because of the good reputation of the beer, but the food really puts it over the top. it's a destination location and i will be back again many times."}
{"text":"My husband and I were up on a visit from Florida and had wanted to go to a brewery while in town.  The day before, we had gone to another brewery but I wasnt that jazzed about it.  My dad suggested we go to Fatheads as he and my brother had both been there previously and he had wanted to get a refill on this cute little growler you can buy and refill with the different brews.  OMG I love this place!!!!!  There are so many different brew selections your head will spin!!  Thank goodness they have this sample plan and that's what my dad, my husband and I did.  My mom was quite happy with her pop!  Both my mom and dad ordered sandwiches which looked incredible and huge!  My husband and I split appetizers of wings and, being the good Clevelander I am, pierogies.  Not a peep of disappointment was heard because the food was delish.  And the beer was amazing!!!   I ended up sampling 4 different selections, all very tasty, from pale ale to fruit beers.  I am sad that I missed oompla loompa when I was there but there is always next time, and I will return!  Or even better, Fatheads, come to Florida!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night spots! Obviously they have an amazing beer selection & we almost always order a few samples of their newly tapped beers so we can try them all. The headwiches certainly live up to their name,  they're giant. We have yet to find anything on the menu that we don't like. They do get really busy though so expect at least an hour wait on Friday & Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Always a treat. Great beer selection, never enough time to try them all. Great appetizers in large portions, especially the fried mushrooms with the peeppery batter. After all the great apps, it's difficult to finish the large sandwiches, which themselves are difficult to choose from the huge selection.   And the whole meal still leaves a few dollars in our wallets!  Fatheads is rarely a disappointment, and although almost always crowded, seating tends to be quick, typically only waiting long enough to finish one beer (making the wait that much easier)."}
{"text":"PROS: Great beer list, friendly service, good atmosphere, decent food

CONS: certain food can be pretty heavy...they use way too many spices. pulled pork is so hot it's practically inedible"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening with friends and the place was packed! That's a good sign in my opinion..means they must be doing something right! We waited about 1.5 hrs and sat outside on the front deck. We were able to bring our drinks from the bar so all was well. I got the bumbleberry beer. Its won awards and I can see why! Its was amazing! A total \"girl beer\" as my hubby calls it. Whatever. Its was yum. When we got sat, I was amazed at how many selections of different foods were offered. It was so hard to choose! I ended up choosing the French dip. I was just as pleased with my sandwich as I was my beer! Our server was cool and very tentative considering the volume of business this place gets. The prices are good for the amount of food you get too! I don't know how I haven't been here before recently. I feel like I missed out! Can't wait to go again! Best brewery. Best food. Neat place. Good service. #winner"}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting at the bar.  I just finished a over done burger and I'm drinking a coke because I have a professional engagement.  My meal has been finished for close to 20 minutes.  I mean, plate empty, glass empty, waiting for the check finished.  So where is my server?  I don't know, and if you find him, could you send him over with my check, I got somewhere I need to be.

UPDATE: 20 minutes later as my server was leaving for the day, he notoced I was still there.  Amazing."}
{"text":"The beer is excellent.
The food is very good and I dare you to eat everything they give you.
Friendly staff and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Noisy, very noisy.  Could not have a conversation.  Love the bumble berry ale.  Just do not love screaming across the bar, ugh.  Female bartender sucked, rushed and rude.  The wings were great."}
{"text":"Went at 6:00pm on Friday with a group of 7.  The wait was 1hr 20min, which isn't surprising based on the time and our group size.  The portions are huge, and everyone's food was pretty good, but not great.  I was not very impressed with their house beers.  Again, not bad, but not worth a return trip.  The service was above average.

Overall the place is fine.  I didn't come away with any complaints.  But for the calories consumed, I'd much rather have eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"The beer was great, I went with a few friends and not one of us was disappointed with what we ordered. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food wasn't great, large portions but a bit bland."}
{"text":"Positives:
-gall darn ENORMOUS. (no, I don't usually say things like \"gall darn,\" but the cheesiness of this place makes my inner Midwesterner come out.)
-really great beer! Especially the Stone Age Imperial Stout, but the Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen (which sounds vaguely dirty) was not bad either.
-pretty good food -- GREAT fries.

Negatives:
-Super saccharine wait staff. This guy was like someone straight out of Tchotchkes' from Office Space: \"Yo duuudes! How about some pizza shooters, jalapeño poppers or extreme fajitas?!\"
-the menu is blindingly busy and made me wanna barf it was so childish. It had little lame catch-phrases that didn't make sense, such as the long-winded explanation about why you could only get fries with the burgers and chips with the \"sandos.\" (- much like THIS long-winded sentence.) I used to love menu features like this when I was, like, twelve.

both positive and negative:
-it's waythefuck out in an area I never go to, ever. This could be annoying, but it's sort of fun to have a destination to go to for good beer.

I'd go back for sure, so long as I'm drinkin'.

P.S. The \"Damn Straight\" burger is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Travel to the Cleveland area had me looking for a good brew pub and found this place had good reviews on Yelp. Started with the Chicken Spinach Artichoke Dip with fried Pita bread. It was very good. Shared a Twisted Brisket \"Headwich\" with my wife and we left totally stuffed. The portions here are large and the quality of the food is very good. Our server was top notch too. So why four stars and not five?  Their beer was sub par. I tried the Black Lager and was not impressed, and then ordered the Imperial Chocolate Stout and it was only okay. I had heard of Fat Head Brewery and was expecting something better. Maybe I tried the wrong beers. I will definitely come back for the food and try something deferent from their brew list."}
{"text":"I find this restaurant/brewery to be average in food and excellent in beer. 

The proportions they give you for meals are huge and for someone like me I usually take half of my meal home for lunch the next day. The food is good but to me it's average. It fits the classic bar food menu for me just with more options. The one thing I absolutely love that no one what has is the Bumbleberry Poppy Seed Balsamic Vinegarette dressing! 

The beer...well always be fantastic.  Spooky tooth is my favorite but I also enjoy the classic lager and kolsch. 

If you have never been you should check it out. It's one of the few restaurants in the area that is not a chain!

Tip: Happy Hour is $1 off all drafts and M-W you can get $3 off growlers all day."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked wings. The Headwhiches are all phenomenal, especially the brisket and the South Side Slopes. The beers are fresh and top notch, worthy of every award they win. Even more amazing is how they transformed the old Danny Boys Market into a brew pub, keeping the style and memories of Danny Boys in tact. I recommend to anyone looking for a great eatery and pub."}
{"text":"Best beer around, and always have something new on tap to keep things interesting.   Don't worry about the long waits this place has at times, there is a reason so many people want to eat and drink here.  It will give u extra time to sample their extra tasty beverages at the main bar before u r seated"}
{"text":"The smoke house wings here are so finger licking good! Also delicious burgers. Haven't really tried many other food items here as my fiancé and I love the wings so much we get them every time. Not to mention we are a huge fan of the beer here."}
{"text":"If you like customization this place is not for you. If you order a wrap you get chips. Burgers come with fries. Too bad? Well you can pay an extra $4 for fries with your wrap. That sucks. The best part about this place is the beer."}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of craft brews to choose from. Its always busy for this reason. It's worth a wait if there is one. You will not leave hungry. Portions are truly filling and at a good price. We always take home extra food."}
{"text":"Service is good.  Beer is good. Food is good. 

If you're looking for some creative bar food with a few good beers to wash it down this is a good place to go in the burbs.  The place is pretty big and sat our party of 12 pretty much right away.  Even with a large group our service was fast and server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best microbreweries in Ohio and easily the best place to grab food/drink in North Olmsted. I was here on Saturday for dinner and drinks and was lucky enough to snag two spots at the bar on a busy night. The decor is modern and the venue is huge. They have giant bottle caps with the iconic Fathead displayed throughout the restaurant. Service was pretty quick for how busy it was and everyone was friendly. They also have an awesome patio outside, and a billiards area great for parties. 

I started out the night with Zeus Juice, mistakenly not looking at the alcohol percentage before ordering. The Belgian Ale was over 10% alcohol and was served in a snifter. I took my time and enjoyed the great flavor, with hints of banana and clove. My friend and I split some of their full smoked wings. These are AWESOME! We could not even finish 12 between the two of us. Fatheads is known for having \"sandwiches bigger than your head\". Well these are easily the largest wings I have ever encountered. We got the medium and the honey chipotle - both delicious and tender. The honey chipotle had a bit of a kick to it, but I am a fan of spicy. I capped off the night with one of their award winning pale ales - the Trailhead. A great, crisp beer for the summer - and some of the proceeds are donated to the Cleveland Metroparks! 

They have a wide selection of house craft beers and a few seasonal rotating taps. They also have a great guest tap and bottle selection that changes often. If you order a bud light here, you may be asked to leave. If you have not been to Fatheads, get your butt up there for some award winning craft beer and huge chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Short and simple...hands down my favorite brewery to visit! Love the beer, so many food choices and great service. Can't find anything to complain about, I don't live in Cleveland and I've visited about 8 times. I really wish we got a Fat Heads in Buffalo!"}
{"text":"Great place if you have a big appetite, very good selection of some excellent craft beers and the food is served in huge portions - even the salads."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Everything I have ever had has been delicious, and the portions are huge!  The prices are great as well.  Big fan of the nachos and Bumbleberry beer."}
{"text":"Never been blown-away with my meals here, but the food is decent and their beer selection is quite extensive.

They are known for their overstuffed sandwiches, but last time there we had a BBQ burrito that I thought was better than the sandwiches.

One last thing...if you order the Cuban sandwich and do not want it to be off-the-charts spicy, ask them to hold their fiery sauce as it overpowered the taste of the sandwich."}
{"text":"We have always wanted to go here and what a better night than my husbands birthday. First, the place is always crowded- I know this as we have attempted many times before with no luck as the lines are crazy long.
Today, we snagged a little table as soon as we got there and managed to bypass the 1.5 hour wait. Phew! The food is fantastic and while a little pricey for pub food, it's worth it. The beer is oh so good and the Cap'n Crunch beer was fab! Overall, the experience was great sans the crazy wait. Side note and worth it for all things: that brisket sandwich! It's life changing"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good although not too many healthy options. Lots of beers to choose from including a good selection of in-house ones. The Christmas seasonal rivals Great Lakes. My biggest complaint has been with the game / party room which is pretty good, but we've been kicked out many times for private parties. I suppose they get more money for these, but it's frustrating when four people just drop $16 in the Golden Tee machine and then get kicked out for a party."}
{"text":"Very impressed. The beers are top notch. Any of the IPAs are a good choice and the Pilsner Take 2 Pils is a great easy to drink beer. I had the Buffalo chicken salad. The salads are huge with lots of good crunch to it and house made dressings. All the food looked great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow everything about this place was fantastic! Good cold beer, the wings were ridiculous, the Twisted Brisket was amazing and the bartender was a lot of fun!  Thanks Monica and Fat Heads for making a boring dinner on the road for business worth while!"}
{"text":"First off, met my wife and her co-workers after 6:30 on a Friday night. Actually got seated right away!!!!  The food was amazing. The wait staff was hustling. Tried 5 different beers. The Starlight Lager was my favorite by far. I know this is short but, just trust me, this place is great."}
{"text":"Beer is fantastic but the bartenders couldn't care less about their customers. I'm here from Chicago so rest assured I do not hold a grudge against this establishment... The bar tenders seemed like robots who cared little for human interaction. 4 of our 5 beer orders were taken with no words. At the end of our evening the bartender was eating behind the bar and checking out a fellow employees new prescription. Weird. Never felt like less of a guest than this. BTW, the beer is pretty good. Just don't expect to be tested like you're welcome. Also, bar back guy is awesome."}
{"text":"#2 sandwich spot behind Melt.  Always excellent beers (Head Hunter I.P.A) and wonderful service."}
{"text":"The fries were very very good! The buns that the burgers are served on are exceptional and the music they play in the restaurant is a plus! 

The seating is super uncomfortable (hard wooden booths) and I didn't really like my burger but it's a place I'm sure I'll come back to in the future."}
{"text":"If you are near here and hungry, stop in. Place is great and Im not a drinker. The Fat Italian (minus egg) is top notch."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you want halfway decent service.  Have been here twice.  The first time was so bad, they did not reduce the bill, but gave us a gift card. Service was just as bad the second time.  The good thing is the food. Their burgers were tasty and the onion rings were wonderful and spicy."}
{"text":"I had a fun time here even though I had to wait a very long time for a table on Saturday night. I wasn't expecting to really like the place, given it is a Pittsburgh transplant and I try to stick with Cleveland local spots. However, they did an awesome job of making the place feel local. Stadium mustard, sausage, and pierogies were everywhere. It was just the sort of food you want to see in a brewpub from Pittsburgh. However, I did get a little depressed about eating the food with the constant reference to \"fat.\" Really? Do I want to get fat?"}
{"text":"Great time with family here.  Called ahead and they made every attempt to get us seated quickly.  Sat a group of 12 within 15 minutes during a busy day over the holidays.  They were great, service was solid, beers were all excellent, and the food was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The food was good, not excellent. HUGE portions. Can share everything, even the side salad. The bumbleberry salad dressing was great. My husband loved the grilled wings. Cuban sandwich was good. The Battle Ax beer and black night were BERY tasty. Next time, appetizers and brews!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed! Great selection of beer and the servings are huge! Try the fried mushrooms! You can order whole pizza's or the regular pub fare there but the real hit is the house brews! Check out the back area for pool tables and to watch the games!"}
{"text":"pretty nice place. even if you aren't a beer drinker they have a decent list of wines and even cocktails."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a proper review about the food because from what everyone else is saying this place is great.


Placed an order over the phone and confirmed my price.

Go to pick it up and went from $40 to $50.  Explained that wasn't what I was quoted over the phone and got the \"let me get my manager\" line.  Wait a few minutes for that person to come back so they can tell me the manager is on their way.

I have better things to do than to wait for someone to renegotiate my price with me.  Left the food there and walked out.  Really REALLY wanted to try this place.  Oh well...."}
{"text":"Great food here at Fatheads; as a matter of fact, of you have a craving for baby back ribs, you will not be disappointed; they are very tasty and tender, but I would at least order a half rack; their ribs are already filling enough.  I also once ordered the fish and chips dinner, and I got one or two HUGE SIZE fish fillets, very tasty as well.  And the beers?  Well, one of my very favorites is the Bumbleberry, even better when you ask for double the blueberried for a garnish.  All their beers are excellent; gotta support your locally-made beers.  No crap on tap - only CRAFT!"}
{"text":"Best wings and root beer ever!  With TVs and great service, what else do you need?  Some pretty amazing sandwiches on that menu too!"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite beer place, but some of the bar backs have been less then enjoyable for what they do. 
Just wanted to say that Brandon has been a great addition, this is the experence that a coustomer is suppose to have at a place they love!"}
{"text":"Great brewpub with a wide variety of beers brewed on premises and consistently good food to complement the beverages. The bar area is a great place to have a few beers with friends or watch a game, and the dining area is large enough that you shouldn't have to wait long for a table even when the place is busy."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a wide variety of beers. Some of which are brewed in house. Nice people. Cool games to play. Love it."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars for the category it's in - brewpub. I come to town once or twice a year, and we will get a meal or two here, so about 10 meals so far. (I grew up with Danny Boy, so this location is bittersweet.) This review is for food and root beer, I don't drink these days and can't comment on the beers. 

The food has been consistently good. The fried items are sometimes a little greasy at the bottom of the bowl, but the batter is delicious, and the veggies underneath (mushrooms, onions, or pickles) big and perfectly cooked.  The wings are nicely smoked and generally tender and juicy. I would prefer the \"spicy\" wing sauce to actually be spicy, but I'll live. The \"spicy\" chipotle sauce is a dead ringer for Frank's Redhot.  The housemade ranch is delicious and creamy.  I'm a big fan of the root beer, it's different every time. This week it had strong notes of clove.  The only change I'd like is that I prefer more veggies on my meat sandwiches.

I've always had good luck with servers. On our most recent visit there was a snafu with the food, and the competent server corrected it and offered us a dessert for the trouble. Very fair. 


Accessability note: for the mobility-impaired, this is a tough location, and not set up well. The handicapped entrance is on the opposite side of the building from the parking. And the host station is on the opposite side of the building from the handicapped entrance. This location needs a wheelchair lift at the main entrance, which is next to the parking lot."}
{"text":"Great beer. Really bad food. I got a party melt and there was a small 7 oz burger in the middle of a huge Pirerce of bread. So much bread left over, the server asked if i wanted a box. The chips were in edible. So old, and soggy, that i could not get my teeth through them."}
{"text":"Fatheads, you're delicious and your beer is great... but where did you take my Jalapeño Cheddar sauce to? :(

Soft Pretzel sticks are a win. The burgers are fantastic - try the ParmaSutra (it has a pierogi on it!) And the chips are great with any dipping sauce or none at all!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  Portion sizes are out of control, so its definitely a quantity over quality type of place.  Smoked chicken wings were enormous, but were tough and had little to no flavor, which was disappointing.  Loaded fries as an app were good, and the enormous portion was enough for 4-6 people.

Prime rib sandwich and 1# hot dog were alright, but nothing to write home about. The menu is very large and would probably go back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Great place ! Lots of parking and an absolutely outstanding selection of beers ! I love the bumbleberry the best . Food is above average for a brewery . Just stay away from the bar seating area . Very unprofessional, sexual references and a lot of off beat comments . However , I will return but will sit away from the bar !!"}
{"text":"Hefty portions, and the quality is not bad! My favorite item is the smoked chicken wings. The beer selection is obviously mostly their own, though they have other beers on the menu as well. Good place to catch the game and mingle with friendly patrons.

They don't take reservations, and if you are not interested in waiting, I would patrol the bar area for an open seat. It usually takes me 30 minutes - 1 hour to find a seat this way during the peak hours, but still shorter than it takes to get a table."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short. Been here dozens of times and love the beers. Their wings are my current favorites. Never bad. 
Their sandwiches can be hit or miss just due to there being too much going on but you'll never leave hungry. 
I gotta try their pizza and the pulled pork chili yet. 
Favorite beers: Bumbleberry, Bean Me Up Koffee Stout, Spooky Tooth Imperial Pumpkin and Holly Jolly Xmas Ale."}
{"text":"Awesome time.  Great food and lots of it. Our waitress Alyssa was so awesome and freindly, we had a great time. We will definitely go back. You have to experience it youself."}
{"text":"Its always so talked up. The food is meh, but you wont leave hungry. 

The beer selection seems wide, but I don't overpay for beer so its lost on me. 

Go for the beer if you know what you are ordering. 

Always a wait. Always feels dirty, given last visit the roof was leaking which was obviously not intended. Parking is terrible. Annoyingly loud people.  Not much positive to say... oh blueberries in the bumble-berry was actually pretty sweet. But that is all I got. I'm dropping the over-hyped card on this one."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Fatheads! They have delicious wings, their fish and chips are my favorite around Cleveland, and they make in house root beer that is phenomenal. This is one of my go-to places for friends visiting the area!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for not just the craft beer but the food also. The steak sandwich I had was excellent and huge.  Sandwiches come with house made potato chips.The onion rings on the top were very dark brown in color but not burned.  They were also quite spicy.  Their beers are well known in Cleveland.  The Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen was good as was the service.  I am told its can be difficult to get a table as a walk-in.  We got there early on a Saturday afternoon and had no problem."}
{"text":"My favorite dish from them is the \"big Cleveland\" or \"Clevelander\", it's got kielbasa, bratz, and some other stuff and it's amazing.  It's a large sandwich and you can't go wrong with this one.  Their fullsized wings are large and their sauces are quite nice.  Bumbleberry is my favorite beer from them and their food is priced very nicely.  I never see any workers in the brewery, but then again I usually go at night so they may be off for the day.  It's got a nice vibe and touch to the place and I go regularly.  I have had 1 bad experience with one of their female bartenders but it may be an isolated incident so I won't include that experience in this review."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, mostly for the beer but the food is pretty good too.  Everyone in their reviews is correct about the large portions.  Sandwhiches are huge!  I've never had a bad meal here. Definitely not healthy food but always have lunch for the next day.  

The beers are great!  Haven't had a bad one yet.  

Service- Eh.  It's okay.  They're busy most of the time that I've been there.  None of the servers I've had have been particularly attentive.  If you don't order a drink they definitely treat you a little differently.  My newly pregnant sister-in-law noticed that right away.  

Great atmosphere and the patio is wonderful on a nice night."}
{"text":"I came out to Cleveland for business and found myself coming back to Fat Heads 3 or the 4 days I was out here. I've gone to many microbreweries over the past few years and this has by far stood out as the best non-dive bar to date. I really enjoyed trying their beers but what's really sold me is their food... come hungry and order the Hogzilla or Twisted Brisket and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Perfect combination of excellent beer and comfort food. The pizza is crisp and the burgers are juicy. Excited to see this local establishment getting regional and even national attention for the selection of brew!"}
{"text":"Great beer huge sandwiches 
Enough fries for 10 people.
Efficient but we had to work to get our server to smile"}
{"text":"I just had a sampler of their beer.  The bartender was great.  Interesting person to talk with who had an excellent knowledge base of the company, its history and their products.  The beers were all very good.  The blueberry was a surprising hit.  Not wicked sweet and tasted like beer, not fruit.  The place is huge so there's plenty of seating.  That's critical because the place rocks!  Constant turnover which was managed exceptionally well.
I'm coming back for the food.  If they can do beer this well the food must be amazing!"}
{"text":"We love fat heads! Although we are big beer drinkers they do offer a great selection or favorites. It is exactly what you'd expect for a bar and restaurant combo. It can get loud but I don't think it's anything that should turn you off. The burgers and sandwiches are awesome. They also have some really great appetizers."}
{"text":"Fat Head's is a great place to grab a really good beer and a ton of food. Chef Derek is an old coworker and we've always loved his food! My fiance and I are both bartenders so we tend to sit at the bar and the bartenders at Fat Head's were friendly and fun. On several occasions the bar is full so we'll grab a table. We always start with a cold refreshing beer. We usually shoot for the honey blueberry ale, the headhunter IPA, or the sampler which offers smaller portions of 8 great beers they brew. Next we move onto a few appetizers and I highly recommend the smoked chicken, spinach, and artichoke dip. We usually ask for more flat bread to make sure we get every bite of the dip...it's that good! On separate visits we've also had the deep fried pierogies and smokehouse wings, which are both amazing! After appetizers and wings we're pretty full but order \"headwiches\" anyway, you can't go to Fat Heads and not try one! They are extremely large but are a great late night snack so get one. My fiance's favorite is \"The Bob and Martha\" and I actually prefer a sandwich by the name of \"Artery Clogger\". We've also tried the pizza and they are also very delicious. All in all, with a large menu to choose from and an amazing beer selection, you simply can not go wrong at Fat Heads!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is larger than it appears but does need more parking! Sandwiches are as big as your head so plan to share when you can. Love getting an adult rootbeer with Jager but the Vanilla Stoli is good too!

Enjoy pierogis for an appetizer and definitely try out their whole wings"}
{"text":"The only down fall to this place is the wait. It is that popular that every time we go we have to wait for an hour and half. They are plenty of beers to sample while you wait. They brew their own beer at Fat Head's and it is quite tasty. Plenty of room of large parties and the parking is made for the busy restaurant. I recommend really any burger on their menu! Great place for a burger and a beer!"}
{"text":"Wow factor everything I come here. Good food and the best beer in the city! Trust me!"}
{"text":"Fabulous beers and heady brews! Sometimes up to two hour wait which is nuts!  But definitely worth the wait. Have a headhunter or two to pass the time!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Fat Head's since they opened, and it is always worth the time. I'm not a fan of their food, in general, but there are some good things on the menu(pizza and wings are ok). What I mainly come here for is the beer, the best in NE Ohio. The guy that said the beer sucks here either thinks Bud is the best beer on earth, is a troll, on crack, or all of the above. The brewer here nails all styles, but the IPAs and IIPAs keep me coming back.

This place can get crazy crowded, so come during lunch, or expect to wait. There is a large game area in the back that is worth checking out if it's swamped up front. Also, I will say the service can be slow at times... even when it's not crowded. But all in all, it is usually pretty good. 

If you like beer, this is the place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"2nd time here from NC. Good beer (Jack Straw pilsner), but food is not good. In our group, ribs came out burnt, when returned under done, sandwiches are big, but a lot of bread. To me, typical of Ohio- a lot of quantity, but food quality is lacking."}
{"text":"Great find in the Cleveland area.  After a long day of traveling and delayed flights, my colleague picked me up from the Cleveland airport and seeing my condition rushed me to Fat Heads for some emergency revitalization.  What a cool place.  

The parking lot was filled to capacity and over flowing into the next lot.  That was a great sign from the start.  The place was packed but it was also huge and well staffed so we were seated immediately.  A sheet of 15 or so different beers currently available was handed to us.  Once we chose, it was delivered cold and prompt.  

Fantastic beer.  I tried two different ones and both were very good.  My colleague was driving and they had a non-alcoholic one for him. 

We ordered some signature sandwiches and when they came they were mind boggling.  Mine was the \"full Cleveland\" and it stood about 6 inches off the plate and was the diameter of a salad plate.  Multiple layers of sausages, sauerkraut and hot sauce held together with large wooden stakes.  I had to tackle it with a knife and fork.  I couldn't finish it but I sure did try.  It was delicious. 

So we left revived and sated.  The place has a sports bar atmosphere.  Lots of people and noise.  Everyone seemed in a good mood and the staff was top notch."}
{"text":"Great beer, awesome location, hit and miss food. 

I have yet to be let down by the beer and the vibe inside is awesome. The food is good, depending on what you get, I think. I got a pizza and it was great but the nacho appetizer is so weird because they use potato chips. I've had another app that was weird, too. 

The staff is also hit and miss. Very rude sometimes, very fun other times. It's a good place to stop in but I don't go often because it's so hard to know if it'll be a good experience."}
{"text":"If you want good beer and a really filling meal, this is your place! The beer is top notch and some of my favorites from around Cleveland! I was a server here for a little while when I was going to school so I have tried a LOT of things on the menu and know that the owners really take pride in their beer and the fatheads brand (I like that in a business).

Here are just some of my favorites: 

The smokehouse wings might be my favorite thing on the menu. My husband is from the south and says that they are as close as you get here in Cleveland to some good bbq smoked chicken. The garlic fries, head hunter onion rings (spicy) and the Parma karma are my favorite apps. As far as the sandwiches, the steakout is my favorite although i really like the Bob and Martha too. They have a huge menu so you really can't go wrong. The only issue I have found it that it is difficult to find something healthy. Salads are an option but they are not nearly as good as the rest of the menu!

Another plus is their bonus room which is a really fun way to spend the time when you have a long wait. I believe they have started having servers in there on busy nights so you dont have to crawl over people at the bar to get a drink! For sure a place to check out if you haven't already! My husband's family likes it so much, we go there pretty much every time they come in town from Kentucky.

{"text":"I like to come to Fat Heads when I am in town visiting family and friends. The food, honestly, is pretty average. They do have a huge menu though, so if you are looking for a place for a big group with varying food preferences, Fat Head's is a good choice. The menu includes an array of chicken wings, salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and pizzas.  

I enjoy Fat Heads more for the beer than the food. They have a daily draft list, along with an extensive list of their own brews. Their local brews include a variety of stouts, IPAS,  porters, pilsners, and wheat beers. I am a fan of the Bumble Berry beer, which despite sounding super girly, is a tasty beer. I also like that their beer list includes different food pairings to go along with the beers.  

Service is always great here. The servers are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"So I really want to like fat heads, but they keep letting me down.  Time and time again.  Here is some advice, if you want fat heads, eat there, don't get carry out.

So I'm having a gathering and want wings. Fat heads use to be my go to place.  I place an order ahead of time, calling at like 2, to pick up an order of 60 wings at 6... No problem they say.  I get there at 6, wait 25 minutes in line to speak to someone to tell them I'm just there to pick up my order.  Another 10 minutes goes by and they tell me it's almost ready.  Really? You had 4 hours.  So I wait another 10 minutes and I'm like, where are my wings I need to go I have people waiting for me.  They had the nerve to say, I'm sorry, we didn't get the order in, they are just piloting them on the fryer now.  I call shenanigans...  BANNED for 6 months.

So I got wings to go the other day.  I get home, they are soft and almost cooked with almost no backyard BBQ sauce on them.  BANNED again.  Maybe I'll try again in 1 years.  

Good luck if you order from their."}
{"text":"Passing through town and found this place on Yelp. They had an extensive menu and was hard to choose something but went for a pierogi & kielbasa sandwich with cheese and the sauce on the side. When I got it, it literally was the size of my head so I opted to put the bun to the side and eat the yummy cheese & onion covered meat & pierogies. It was also served with house made chips that were delicious. I had a peach cider to drink which was sweet (which I like) and definitely a strong peach flavor. My husband had a Bonehead Red beer which he thought was tasty and strong. If we lived any closer, we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place feels like Budwieser bought an Applebees.  UGH!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Not sure why we don't come here more often. Went on a Thursday and it seemed packed. We only waited for 15 minutes however. The place is big enough to accommodate lots of people. They also have great outdoor seating. We ordered the smokehouse wings. Holy smokes! They were amazing. They are WHOLE wings, so be prepared to share with those at your table. The beer selection is fantastic. Highly known for their IPAs, you can never go wrong with their house brews. The sandwiches are truly bigger than yo' head. I ordered the hogzilla. Bbq pork at its finest....overflowing with bbq goodness! The homemade chips are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Busy Busy place, and for good reason, This is the gold standard for beer and bar food. Recommend Head Hunter if you like your beer hoppy. But there is a choice for everyone in beer AND food! The Classic Reuben is honestly one of the best I have had. Pulled pork anything will be great also. The smoked wings are the best! MMMM-MMM"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY disapointing!!!  Food was terrible!  Wings were dry, fries were soggy.  My husband got a pizza ($15) and we laughed because the  $4 frozen pizza we ate last night was better than the crap they served.  Service was mediocre. I gave 2 stars because the french onion soup was decent and we were quoted over an hour wait and waited about 30 min"}
{"text":"Has rotating beers on tap.  Food is great and wonderful atmosphere for watching the game or just having a beer.  Plus if you don't know what type of beer you want, you can get the sample size and try them all."}
{"text":"First, I must say, the best wings I have ever eaten! It's up to you to pick your own poison when it comes to sauces, but, do yourself a s favor and order the smoked wings. Killer! As expected the beer list is quite extensive and everything we tried was rock solid. And yes, the Headwiches are \"Huge\" and a flavor explosion. Their homemade chips are a home run as well. The parking lot was packed when we arrived but we were seated immediately, the place is that big. Service was also spot on. Would definitely hit this spot again if in the area. Hell, the wings and beer alone are worthy of a roadtrip."}
{"text":"Parking was in the back at a strip mall, but it only went up from there. Took my family of 7 out for a late dinner (we were all hungry) and we were all impressed by our first visit.  Service was best I've ever seen ... I think all of the kids got 4-5 refills on their sodas.  The kids meals were huge! Pizza was not quite as big, but big enough.  Burgers were 1/3 pound and delicious!  Restaurant was clean, albeit loud. I'd come here as a businessman, with a family, or as a couple. Joclene was our waitress and she was busy...and incredible!  Fatheads was awesome, but Joclene could make any restaurant look good.  I'm still nibbling on my salad...and I'm a 250 pound man...the thing was HUGE. We ended up taking home despite large appetites and splitting courses. I didn't mention the obvious, but the beer was incredible.  I had the heffeveisen, the Belgian triple, and a session ale. For a small restaurant with two? Locations, the theme was clear but didn't distract from the quality of the meal.i type this as the kids speak of how great cedar point and the food was...

I may never have a reason to visit North Olmstead, OH other than Fathead's...but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The beer sampler is a great way to diversify your pallet. The blueberry beer is phenomenal. The sandwiches are huge but it was a bit bland I had the massive steak egg and cheese. Though it was at 1030am when we got there to watch the US world cup match so I'm letting the bland part slide I still give it 4 stars for the beer selection and affordability."}
{"text":"Well we first went to this place when it first opened and got poor service and terrible food. We thought we would give it the benefit of the doubt for it being new and busy. Tried it again and it's still a bummer. 

We'll start with 5 stars.
-1 for being Pittsburgh based.(yes it's silly, but that's how I feel, I like to support CLE)
+0.5 for the \"Head Hunter IPA\" ----Wasn't amazing, but yes, it truly is a well made beer.
+0.5 for \"Bumble Berry\"-----Clean and refreshing with fresh blueberries swimming  in it
-1 for the spinach dip which we were told by the server \"excellent choice\" the pita chips appeared to be fried in old fry oil(dark and very oily tasting) and the spinach dip tasted like they poured bacon grease in it (perhaps this place is really made for fat heads)
-2 Ordered Medium Rare Burger which came just about over Medium Well. I faced the facts that they clearly just don't have capable cooks in the back for being second failed attempt food-wise. So I ate with a sad face.
-1 for sirloin sandwich(like I said, seems to be made for the fat people of Cleveland, everything was way too greasy)
-0.5 for slow service....

 All in all, if you like bad food and wash it down with decent brew from Pittsburgh then maybe this is the place for you, but not for us. That 2nd trip was our last."}
{"text":"Awesome bar set up. ..with great craft beers! ! Love Gogglefogger! Menu is huge. ..never had a bad meal!  Appeals to everyone!"}
{"text":"My family eats here every week. We love it. It's great. I love their variety of craft beers. I love the Garlic fries and also recommend their Cajun chicken spinach salad and south side slopes sandwich to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent Food ! Been there multiple times and never came back Unsatisfied . Killer Ranch is to die for"}
{"text":"This place was pretty much what I expected and I would be giving them about three and half stars based on my experience, but the smokehouse wings put them over the top.  I was here with some family for dinner and wanted to try the smokehouse wings as my entree, so I ordered a dozen.  Big mistake.  Actually, a HUGE mistake because these were the largest chicken wings I have ever had... and it wasn't even their size, but the fact that they give you the whole wing (they don't separate the humerus portion from the radius/ulna portion) that really did me in.  I got the honey chipotle wings and only finished about half of them.

I don't get wings very often, but I did the \"Lakewood wing crawl\" this summer and I think these wings would have won that contest."}
{"text":"Went here for Fathers Day and the entire visit was great! Our server Ron was prompt and knowledgeable. He greeted our table immediately and had our drinks to us shortly afterwards. We ordered the nachos and wings as a starter and my husband had the pastrami sandwich and I had the ribs. The food was absolutely delicious! I told my husband it was one of the best meals we have had for less than $100! We will come back and we will recommend this place to our friends! Thanks again Ron!"}
{"text":"Solid. Huge portions of creative bar food. All beer is excellent and the service is some of the best around. Typically very busy, even on week nights. Beware the smoked wings...HUGE!"}
{"text":"Oh, holy cow.  This place.  Why do I not live in Ohio anymore???

The husband and I usually end up at the same two or three restaurants when we visit our old stomping grounds, because nostalgia and hunger, but on this visit we told our friend to take us somewhere new.  And now we're going to go to the same three or four restaurants when we visit...

Anyway, our friend told us to prepare for giant portions, but we were not prepared enough -- our humble sandwiches could have been meals for days if we had planned it out right!  I had the fancy spicy Cuban sandwich with chips, the husband got a very tasty pulled pork sandwich with fries, and our friend got a smoked chicken pizza, all of which were basically the greatest.  The bread on the Cuban sandwich did not last in the fridge, but picking off the cold meat and cheese a couple days later was more than tasty enough.

Also, beer!  I had a bit of a spat with the waitress over the fact that they wanted to charge me for a sample of beer, but then she explained to me that Ohio laws are different from Florida laws and I sheepishly paid for my sample.  Luckily, it was the super-delicious Trail Head Pale Ale, which, in addition to being worth the sample price also benefited my beloved MetroParks.  My friend had hyped up some sort of salted caramel porter that was depressingly missing from the taps, but hey, that's just something to come back for in a year or so!"}
{"text":"Huge menu, huge portions! Next time, I'll definitely split a meal with my husband. Beer is delicious, of course. Our server was awesome and had great recommendations. We will definitely come back if we are up this way!"}
{"text":"If you have skimmed through any of my reviews you can probably tell I am pretty nice with my stars. If the food is delicious, service is excellent and I like the atmosphere, I'll most likely put you at a 4 or 5 star. I also like to think that because a place had a bad moment once they can certainly redeem it next time around. BUT, something about Fat Head's just didn't really leave me loving this place. 

Atmosphere: Nice but I'm not sure- maybe it seems to commercial for a local brewery? To me it just feels like there is a hundred other places like Fat Head's out there and it's missing something. Call me picky, I don't know. The bar at this place is awesome though. There is definitely a good amount of sitting and also some high tops and booths. And since we prefer sitting in the bar we were happy we didn't have to wait. 

Service: Our waiter was a grouch, not going to lie. I just cannot stand when waiters act like they are doing you some kind of favor for taking your order and then giving you a tip. You're in the service industry, it was your choice, cheer the heck up or go sit behind a desk away from human contact. The only time he was happy was when he delivered our beer and didn't have to wait on us anymore. By the way, my food was OK, thanks for asking. 

Food: Husband had the artery clogger sandwich and loved it and I agree, it was really, really good. I did the basic bacon cheeseburger and ordered it well. It came out maybe medium but since nobody came around to ask, I ate would I could. Fries were delicious though. Also we had the pierogies for an app and those rocked, so good! 

I might stop back if I am in the area but right now it's just \"meh\" There are plenty other breweries I'd put before Fat Head's."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, clean environment and a large variety of food and beer! Enjoy the patio when the weather permits."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the second time in about 6 months yesterday. The first time we thought everything was so so and this time it just wasn't good. I ordered the Euclid Beach medium and my wife got the BBQ burger medium well. The Euclid is a basic cheeseburger with the works. It was cooked a little more than medium which was fine but the bun engulfed the burger...there was a solid inch of open bun around the burger. Way too much bun Fat Heads. The meat was dry and pretty flavorless. If it wasn't for the french fries and the excellent service I would be rating 1 star. It was that bad. My wife's burger wasn't much better...flavorless and dry and the onion ring on top was burnt beyond recognition. I don't know how it left the kitchen looking like that. After the Euclid beach I kind of understand why their burgers are so dressed up...to hide the poor quality of the meat. One more thing...the French fry/potato chip rule is really stupid. I don't care if they are \"free\" with your burger/sandwich...they really aren't bc the price they charge for a sub par burger more than covers the fries/chips. The rule is ridiculous and people should have a choice. I don't get the hype with this place...and most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place!  Our whole family loves it!  No matter how busy they are the service is always good and the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken sandwich with banana peppers, onions, mushrooms & Swiss cheese. Salad everything included & blueberry beer taste good"}
{"text":"Fat Head's opened just a few moments ago and I had to be one of the first to give it a try.  Sitting quietly for months and months now, the idea of a new brewery in the 'hood made me thirsty just thinking about it.  I'm not good with being patient, which is why I went today and why I sat at the bar due to the 30 minute wait at 2:30pm on a sunny, Saturday afternoon.

Fat Head's offers 10 brews on-tap, made in-house.  You can try a \"sample\" in a cute little glass for about $1.45.  I tried a few, my friend tried a few.  So far the favorite is the Tree Hugger Ale.  My friend liked the blonde.  The stout isn't half-bad either.  All are drinkable with no crazy or overwhelming flavors.

Brewmaster Matt was workin' the bar & answering questions about the brews.  Nice guy, next time I'm in, I might buy him a drink.

The other beer offered rotates in & out.  A nice variety if you can't find a Fat Head to quench your thirst.

Food:
Ok, I know I'm not always real sharp, but seriously, couldn't they have one vegetarian option on the menu?  I understand a Brewery is about das Bier first!  (As it should be)  But when offering a menu as large as this, give a girl a vegetable, please!!!  Heck, I'll even take a fish not deep fried.

We ordered nachos with pulled pork, French onion soup, and a Reuben. 
The Soup did not have the usual thick & beautifully melty cheese on top.  I'd say it was beef bouillon w/ a few croutons & onions thrown in on a handful of mozzarella.  Not to be ordered again it was a far cry from good.  The Nachos, while appealing to look at, lacked certain oomph.  They do come on Fat Head's home-made potato chips. (YUM!)  But again, maybe the cheese is a problem for the place.  Yeah, its bar food, but really we can't do better than stadium cheese spread on the chips?  The pulled pork didn't have much flavor either.  I must say though, the toppings were nicely spread throughout the mound of chips and not just thrown on top.  The Rueben came with a mound of those yummy, yummy chips.  Bread was nicely toasted.  The meat was good & the crout not bad.  Overall a decent sandwich.

Service:
Matt rocked it out.  I like that he worked the bar and is the crafter of the beer.  Our server, well, she was overwhelmed and didn't mind letting us know.  Eh, she could have been better.  The GM did chat with us quickly before we were leaving; checking on the service etc.  I like that.  A good manager needs to know what his customers think.  Service probably could use some tweaking, but I'm hopeful that GM does a good job and it will thereby get better.  As I mentioned, the place us brand spankin' new.

Overall I give it an A-OK 3 stars.  They're off to average start.  I'll go back, pray for better service and maybe eat a snack before I go."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great atmosphere. The food is amazing. Burgers, headwiches, salads, wings, shrooms. Patio is a great place to enjoy in the warner weather."}
{"text":"Smoked wings were fantastic.  Large, cooked perfectly and just the right amount of sauce. Great beer as well."}
{"text":"We are pretty lucky in Cleveland to have amazing breweries on both the east and west side - however I truly feel that Fatheads owns the crown...truly no contest.  For instance the Belgian powerhouse Sorcerer brewed with rock candy or its lighter sister Head Trip - both smooth no nonsense brews that range in abv from 10-11%.  Or the hop fest of award winning Headhunter, Hop JuJu or DankeSinatra.  Maybe it's seasonal you prefer with Pimp my Sleigh, Oompa Loompa or St Fattys - you really cannot go wrong - well except for that Battle Axe beer that, yeah that tastes like what I can only imagine cat pee tastes like.  You are in craft beer Mecca and you should recognize that instead of asking the server \"what one would taste like Bud Light\" as that makes fellow patrons wish upon a star that someone would ask you to be relegated to drinking only water. 

Now food - don't do the pizzas - they are soggy messes.  And salads - are you really considering that? You should probably just go somewhere else if u want a salad and a Bud Light...

Now for appetizers you can't go wrong with wings, the garlic parm fries, the Bavarian pretzels (will be a last meal on earth request) or the nachos.  The burgers are all good and do have fries - the Parma Sutra is my favorite - I mean bacon cheeseburger topped with a pierogi - can it BE more Cleveland?  Headwiches come with homemade chips (ask for ranch) the bay of pigs (delish), the beauty & the beasty (amazing), the clevelander hot dog (yes please) all worth the time and effort.  Chicken sandwiches come down to the Aloha Chicken for me - tonight I order that and my only complaint was the wing sauce looked like two small dribbles and that was all.  Service was good - attentive and made menu suggestions.  Even took desert home - Baileys Cheesecake - but we are to full to try it; tomorrow's another day right? 

Bottom line I would pay them to open a place in the east side - i miss this place so much! Keep doing the fabulous beer work you are doing; the dedication shows!"}
{"text":"Big portions, definitely on the pricey side (at least for broke college students it is) but there is a LOT of meat so you get what you pay for. I came here on a Wednesday night with two friends and we waited for about two minutes even though the restaurant was pretty full. Service was good, extensive menu, tons of meat. I ordered the spicy cuban burger, my friends ordered the black bean veggie burger and a plate of wings. Flavors are excellent, very very filling. Definitely would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. If your a craft beer person it is a great place to go. However I am not."}
{"text":"Good beers and great food! For beer I usually just stick to bumble berry, which is great. I try something different each time when I eat here and it's so good every time. Fat heads is a must if you've never been!"}
{"text":"LOVE Fat Head's! This is my go-to place to take visitors from out of town. Their beer is excellent! They change the beer menu daily and there is always an excellent variety for dark and light beer lovers. My favorite is the Bumbleberry which they put actual blueberries in :) Their appetizers are huge, my friends like the onion rings (which have at least 2 inches of spicy breading) and the nachos are massive. I've loved the salads and sandwiches I've tried. Mondays they have $1 off beer till 9 and M-W you can get growler refills for $3 off. Service has always been good everytime I've been here. Another plus, they always play the Tribe games and have TVs throughout the restaurant. Definitely worth a try for a relaxing night out with friends for good food and beer."}
{"text":"Go to Fat Head's for wings and beers (bumbleberry, starlight varieties are my faves). I wouldn't recommend any of the sandwiches because besides the meat portion of it, the rest is carbs-and greasy ones at that. They serve them with potato chips that are made in-house but are not tasty. Service today was good, and we sat on the patio. I'd definitely look to try more of their appetizers but not the main entrees."}
{"text":"Service is excellent even when they are slammed.  Everything we have ordered has been top notch.  My only complaint is having to settle for chips over fries, although for $3.99 you get a large basket of tasty fries."}
{"text":"True to my word I brought my boyfriend back last week.  This time the food was jusk OK.  Not bad...but not great  I hope this visit was just a fluke.  I'll give it a 3rd try to find out!"}
{"text":"Killer wings. Killer Sandwiches all over the board. Italian by far my favorite. Chips are perfect. This place is so top dawg. I don't drink beer but it supposedly the beer is rippy. I can't emphasize more how much this place means to me. Fatheads Vs. Lizard. FATHEADS"}
{"text":"My first visit was on a Thursday night and it was quite busy! Parking can be tricky but you can usually find a spot soon enough. Part of my party arrived earlier than me but the wait wasn't that long at all. This place is humongous! 

Our server was very attentive and helpful. She was able to give suggestions on beer. I really liked that you could get samples of their beer. I tried an Amber ale, their pumpkin latte, and a weizenbock (don't remember their actual names). All were very good. As always, their bumbleberry was perfect (with real blueberries floating around). 

We started with the onion rings as appetizers. As a party of 5, they were a perfect size and prepared us for the big meals ahead. The dipping sauce has a bit of a kick but very good. 

I got the cheesesteak, I was a bit apprehensive because the only review on it was a poor one but that was in 2012 so I risked it and I'm glad I did. It is a great and filling sandwich. Nothing was too overwhelming, very well-balanced. While the chips are good, I was disappointed to learn you can't substitute fries. 

My mom got the Cajun spinach salad. The chicken was very good. She got the bumbleberry poppy salad dressing, it is fantastic! They did forget to put the egg in her salad but she decided to not say anything. It was a huge salad! My dad got a pastrami sandwich (not the melt) and he ate it but he said it was salty. 

My brother got the pulled pork burger, he liked it and I liked it as well (though I am not a huge BBQ person). I also got to try his fries which were good. My sister-in-law got the grown up grilled cheese.She is a bit of a picky eater but she thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Overall, it was a amazing visit. It's kind of a drive from our home but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Laughed when I found out that this is part of a Pittsburg, PA chain.  So...Pittsburg owns former National City Bank (now PNC), Fat Heads and...Cleveland BROWNS????"}
{"text":"If you are a craft beer lover and can't get enough of comfort foods, then this is the place for you. Fat Head's has 20 house brews on tap and another dozen or so guest brews for your drinking pleasure. The menu is extensive and sumptuous featuring wings as the house specialty. I always order a flight of beers in a brewery to fully sample its offerings, also ordered pierogis with cheese & beans and pepper jack cheese cubes. The food arrived quickly and was fresh, hot & tasty. The bartenders are very knowledgeable about beer and always ensure your glass stays full. I highly recommend a visit to Fat Heads for an awesome time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BEER!  They brew it right on sight.  I love their Headhunter IPA.  I highly suggest you get their sampler on your first visit.  It offers 12 different 4oz samples of their own beers.

As other yelpers stated this used to be the old Danny Boy's Farmers Market, and the owners did a wonderful job of remembering that they were there first.  In fact they still sell a crafted root beer from the original recipe from Danny Boy's.

The food is pretty good - the wings especially.  They are offered in two varieties.  Smoked (highly suggest), and then the regular deep fried variety.  They have a great selection of sauces to choose from, too.  The sandwiches are not exactly what I consider to be home runs, but it's not for lack of effort.  Fat Head's seems to be following the \"hyper sandwich\" formula by offering more than just burgers, or to use their nomenclature \"Headwiches\".  They have one called the Parma Karma that is loaded with perogies, brats,and bangers among other things.  

It's not that I'm against that type of sandwich, but when you visit a place like this often it tends to get too much.  I do recommend their buffalo calamari.  Their take on this has roasted red peppers, blue cheese, and buffalo wing sauce.  Really yummy.

Seating should never really be an issue as the place is huge, and they can certainly entertain large groups.  If you're looking to sit at the bar it's a different story as these seats fill up the quickest.  There's also outdoor seating for the summer time,"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch.  Overall we enjoyed our visit.  The place is a new renovation of what used to be an old market.  It's nice inside, nothing incredible, basically what you'd expect from a brew pub, but it was clean and tastefully decorated.  There are logos from local breweries painted on the wall, and some Fat Head's artwork around along with some of their beer awards to round on the decor.  Our only complaint was that the high ceilings and large amount of hard surfaces made it kinda noisy inside.  It wasn't bad during lunch when the place wasn't crowded, but with more people it might have been bothersome.

As for the food, I ordered a club sandwich and my wife ordered a burger.  Both were good and portion sizes were very (very) large.  I felt like I definitely got my money's worth.  There were also some homages to Cleveland on the menu with dishes featuring brats and pierogi.  Everything tends towards the large size though, even advertising some of the sandwiches on the menu as \"As big as your head\".  So if that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it, but if you like smaller portions you might struggle to find something order.  My advice is just get a takeout box.

Now we come to the real reason we went to Fat Heads; the beer.  Fat Head's own brews are award winning stuff.  Their own Head Hunter IPA has won many awards and is considered the best IPA in the country right now.   They also have many high quality micro-brews from other breweries (Bell's, Bear Republic, Great Divide, Founders, etc.) on tap.  If you love good beer and are in the area you owe it to yourself to stop by.

All in all we like out visit and will probably go back when we're in town."}
{"text":"This is an awesome brewery! This place is absolutely enormous!! They are busy on the weekends though, so I recommend calling to make a reservation. They have a large bar to hang out at while you wait for your seat. They also have billiards and darts to play, with several flat screen tvs to watch sports games. 

The beer selection is great. The Holly Jolly is a wonderful Christmas ale that they brew. This visit I had the Head Hunter IPA, which was hoppy but great. 

The food selection is vast. Our table got three of the marvelous sounding appetizers: Shrooms, Frickles, and pretzels. The pretzel was so soft and wonderful with the cheese cup on the side. Loved the shrooms, but beware because they come out HOT. Burnt the roof of my mouth a bit. 

The smoke house wings were talked up a lot, so that is what I went with. They are big and have a great amount of meat. Had the honey BBQ and honey chipotle sauce on the sides. Honey chipotle has a decent kick! The fresh cut fries had the perfect amount of crunchiness. 

The waiting staff is very fast and friendly. I have absolutely no complaints. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It is with mixed emotions that I write this review.  I have to say first off, I love their craft beer and food, but the service received on my first and probably last visit was unacceptable.

As I love their brew and have heard great things about their food, I decided to try the brewery out on last week----maybe because it was Friday the 13th I was destined for bad luck.

There was an hour wait, so I sat at the bar---amazing service there I might add.  Then off to the restaurant where it all went downhill. 

We ordered wings and some kick ass sounding sandwiches.  The server asked specifically if we wanted the wings out first, and we confirmed yes.  45 minutes passed and no server or food.  Eventually a runner brought out all the food together, and everything was cold.  The server arrived about 5 minutes later and noticed immediately that the wings didn't come out first, and apologized.  We said no problem, but then made him aware of the bigger issue, that everything was cold. He took the food back and said one round of beers were on him for the inconvenience---nice gesture overshadowed by later events.

15 minutes later all the food comes out again.  This time the wings were hot, and very tasty I may add, but the sandwiches were still ice cold.  Only difference is the bread was toasted, along with the wilted olives on toothpicks, holding the sandwich together---clearly the original sandwiches were placed under a heat source allowing the bread to crisp, olives to shrivel, and mayo to heat up, but leaving center ice cold---not good.  After a few minutes the server checked on us to see how things were.  We informed him that our sandwiches were still cold.  At this point he stated he would check on what happened, again, and then disappeared.

Eventually he did reappear, 25 minutes later, and his whole demeanor had changed---The once jovial server was now rude and condescending. He asked if we wanted our sandwiches boxed up---which clearly we hadn't touched.  We responded we don't know (as in disbelief over the situation), he took them away, and I assume threw them out since he came back empty-handed.  Upon his return we explained that the sandwiches were still ice cold and had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for some time before being served (Again, bread toasted and olives shriveled).  Basically we didn't want to reheat them one more time---we ordered a hot sandwich, not a cold nor reheated one---but fresh from the get go.  With much attitude, he proceeded to tell us that he personally threw out the old and watched them make new ones.  Hmmm odd, this was the first time it was mentioned, even before he left us for 25 minutes to figure out what happened---blatant lie.  With a chuckle he asked if we wanted dessert---umm no---and stated he would bring us the check right away.  On a positive note, this is the most attention and time the server spent with us during our 1.5+ hour ordeal.  

The moment of truth, check arrives and we are charged fully for everything. I was more than happy to pay for the wings and beer, but the cold, reheated sandwiches?   And once again chuckling, he stated that he hoped to see us again soon and asked that we give them another chance---doubtful based on the way he handled this and himself. 

The name on the check was Captain, so unsure if this guy goes by that name, or happens to be the dare I say \"lead server\"---either way worst possible service, and this review is all due to that fact.  I can handle the food issues (timing and cold), but coupled with attitude, insincerity and being made to feel like we did something wrong, is something I cannot overlook.  I went in excited and looking for a good meal, but left annoyed and hungry.  

Bottom line, I love their beer, but will buy it from the grocery store next time and alleviate the aggravation."}
{"text":"We came in with a group of friends. It's obviously pretty popular because we waited 45 min to get seated. (They don't take reservations.)

I started with 3 samples of beer since it was my first time here. As a person who doesn't usually LIKE beer, I actually enjoyed the ones I had. I got the Google Fogger Hefenweizen, Spooky a tooth Imperial Pumpkin Ale, and the Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale. I liked them all equally! No complaints there.

For dinner, I got the Cheesesteak. It says it's the best on the menu, but honestly, I've had better in a mall food court. It wasn't bad though, but lacking in a good seasoning on the steak, as well as the amount of steak on the sandwich. It was served with chips (as all their sandwiches are) and they were my favorite part of the meal.

My husband had pulled pork and I definitely should have gotten it. It was delish!! (And it had bacon on it...so....DUH!)

All around a good experience. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is not for me.  If you don't like enormous portions of beef between buns, the menu has very little to offer.  I'm not a vegetarian or anything but really the menu appears huge until you realize that it's all variations on a carnivorous theme.  I don't mean to be to harsh, there are a couple of things on the menu that look like they'd be worth a shot if I accidentally find myself there again.   The service was quick, friendly and responsive to my gal's request for ranch dressing.  The beer is good but I can get that at the drug mart down the street from my house.  Pretty disappointing place."}
{"text":"Bumbleberry is the best!  Food is awesome and the service is always top-notch.  Love seeing what beers are new on tap....."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Beer selection is excellent. Their beers are usually great, and they always have a great guest beer selection.  Food is very good. My only wish is that they allowed chip/fries substitutions. Getting in there on Friday or Saturday nights nearly impossible. Staff is excellent, and they know their beer.  These folks win many beer awards, and they deserve them."}
{"text":"this is a terrible place for mushrooms that i was looking for to eating & enjoying. they were expensive $8.95 for a basket of them that our friends didn't even want to eat they were that bad. the paper was greasy also & i called the MANAGEMENT to complain about this & they said that they would send me a gift card i haven't received it yet & I do not live that far away from this place that it takes them 2-3 weeks to just send a card or a complimentary card out to me. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. the only reason is we were with friends from work & they said for us to meet them there. don't waste your money by going here."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch during the week and the food was pretty good. Sat at the bar and service was pretty good too. My only critique was that the bartender was overly focused on making chit chat and wasn't listening to the order."}
{"text":"Love the beer at this place. Matt Cole, head brewer, is in my opinion one of the absolute best brewers around, if not the best. His award winning Head Hunter IPA is a must try, even if your not an IPA person. It is AMAZING! Food is good, portions are good size that should fill almost anyone. Only thing I don't like is \"no substitutions\" can be made. So if your choice includes potato chips, your stuck. You either eat them or you don't. Try this place and the beer. You will like it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but lately the food just isn't that great. The sandwiches are soooo big but over-priced. I really wish that all the sandwiches would come WITH fries instead of having to pay extra for a side of them. The blueberry beer is good, however, it tastes different depending when you go! Wish they had some tasty fried pickles and that the soft pretzels were fresh like they used to be!"}
{"text":"We planned visiting here during a short trip to the North Olmsted area after reading the great reviews here on Yelp.  We were not disappointed!

A group of 5 of us stopped in for a late lunch and were surprised to encounter a wait for a table despite seeing several empty tables in the restaurant.  Boo.  The bar area was quite large and had both booths and high-tops for open seating (the booths were a bit on the smaller side though).  The restaurant itself was quite open and fairly noisy even though not all tables were occupied.  I can only imagine it gets quite loud in here during a peak Friday or Saturday night!

Once we were seated, it took our waiter quite some time to come over and take our drink orders (perhaps they were understaffed?).  It took a fair amount of time for him to return, but the beers did not disappoint!  I only wish he had let us know that flights were available if we wanted to sample the various types - we saw other tables ordering them on the way out.  

As for the food, the menu was great with plenty of great options.  Most of our group opted for a burger and everyone was quite pleased with their selection.  I ordered on of their salads and was impressed with the large portion.  The vegetables were all very fresh, though I was a little disappointed that the toppings were a bit on the \"skimpy\" side.

Prices were reasonable and the only real issue we had was with the service.  We had to flag down our waiter several times and everything took forever to come out.

I would definitely recommend this place and would certainly stop back in if we're ever in the area."}
{"text":"The best dining experience I had so far in the area. The place was crowded, but the service was fast. Beer was good and cold. The  burger was great. There was six in my party and everyone was happy. This place is a must if you are in the area. My burger and homemade chips were enough for two. And all for $10.50."}
{"text":"I will tell anybody the craft beers here are off the chain and they have the real deal NYC hard apple cider.The portions here will give you a heart attack and high blood pressue.I know the place is decent because the saturday night we came the place had atleast 500 to 1000 people in here eating and the bathrooms were clean.I will say give FATHEADS A try."}
{"text":"Great personable service!  We arrived here after a sudden change of plans.  Great drinks, good burger, tasty wings."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here, last week! Great atmosphere, great selection of food and beers. I ended up getting a Pesto Chicken Sandwich and a Bumbleberry Lemonade. Both were delicious and would recommend! I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Took my father in law for his first visit here.  He loved it.  Always a winner with me and he already wants to come back.  He had the brewben and I had the beauty and the beasty.   Both were huge and delicious!  He can't stop raving about the crafted beer or the food.  Waiter was knowledgable and gracious.  Will be returning as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I've been to Fat Heads more times than I can count: sometimes they're fantastic, other times pretty average.
To start, I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on the brewery side of things, though the rest of the family thoroughly enjoys their beers. I went with a friend and we shared a couple sandwiches (French Dip and Chicken with Basil) and they were wonderful, completely delicious.
Another trip, I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and was disappointed with the fact that the chicken breast was dry and tiny for the price. 
Another note is that they won't swap chips and fries. Burgers come with fries, other sandwiches are served with chips. Both are good, but it's just something to be aware of. 
Overall, I'm sure I'll continue going to Fat Heads, and it's worth a visit, but the service and food quality does vary in my experience."}
{"text":"Good beer and food selection! 

Waited for over an hr for a table on a Friday night...but it was worth it.... I think this is a nice place to go with friends for drinks and dinner. This was my first time here but, yes I would come here again, and be willing to wait again if I had to :) I'm relatively new to Ohio and liked this place. It's pretty big and there's a huge parking lot.

Staff is genuinely caring and helpful. Nice place all around.

I'm told the head hunter beer is what they're know for and the burgers with regards to food. Had the beer, IPA, it was good - and I'm not a beer person. I got a buffalo chicken sandwich, was good too. 

Recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Oatmeal stout was very good, but ruined by the pompousness of the bartender who served it to me.  He was slow, not very knowledgeable and kind of a general douche unfortunately. Experience would have been better if the service was. Rocket Man Red Ale was good as well, but not as good as the stout.  Got an appetizer with kielbasa, bratwurst, banger and pierogies. Pierogies were delicious, sausages were just grilled sausages...nothing exceptional.  The portion was great though for below $10.  I could only finish half.  
Looking around me, all of the potions are enormous.  Odd menu note though, pompous must be a theme at this place because there was a whole diatribe on their menu about not substituting chips for fries.  Anyway, I was a bot confused, didn't feel particularly welcome, and was very surprised by this from a small local chain in Cleveland of all places...
Plenty of other brew pubs to spend your $ at in the area...skip this one."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, food is fantastic & super large portions. Staff's very knowledgeable. Open airy space tables not cluttered... The Beer is awesome. Look forward to going back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food is terrific their beer is terrific and their service is terrific. I can't say enough good things about this place. I've been coming here for almost 8 years now and I've never had a bad experience. I truly believe it's a point of Pride and Cleveland and I'm very glad we have it Fatheads is the bomb"}
{"text":"Went last night and had an amazing time. The beers are delicious and presented nicely. Food was A+. Don't miss out on the bacon cheddar fries. I literally just salivated thinking about them. 
Service was excellent as well. 
Highly, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to just have fun and get a few drinks. The options are endless for finding a tasty beer to ur liking!"}
{"text":"Had the smoked wings:   The were ok.  Served as whole wings which was a bit weird.   The sauce drowned the smoke flavor.  some of the beer was okay, some was way not (this coming from an admitted beer nerd). Had the steak and egg burger.   Again, okay."}
{"text":"I had the burger which was pretty good but not incredible. the service too was good but nothing unique. I enjoyed the company the best... it that has nothing to do with the restaurant. so...just an average rating."}
{"text":"VERY mediocre food but giant portions of it. Nice beer selection...the three stars are for the homebrews. If my review were based solely on food, it would be a two at best."}
{"text":"Fatheads!! Please stop giving divine food. I am going there every weekend. You won't be disappointed with any item on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Great food! The environment is certainly fun. We went on halloween night and all the waiters were dressed up. The food took a little while to get to us but it sure tasted good! I really enjoyed eating here and every time I am in Cleveland we go here. It definitely helps that it is close(ish) to the airport!
Go here if you are in Cleveland! This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Fat Heads is officially A-okay. I had a great burger there, and everyone else at my table were really happy with their food too. The wait is still stupid and the place is still crazy loud, and the beer just okay for me. So 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"As my first experience here I was a little under the weather from a hard night out in Lakewood, it was a bit overwhelming to say the least.  Now as  more of a Fat Head's veteran, I have to say I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  You can't go wrong with any of their beers, and every time I try a new dish I like it more and more than my last. 

To all my fellow cheese sauce lovers... their cheese fries are delicious!!! A large plate of fresh cut fries covered in cheese sauce and bacon.  It's a fat kids heaven :)  and mine.  

Another new favorite of mine is the Mo Betta Beef N Chedda Headwhich. Perfectly cut brisket, mushrooms, bacon and of course cheese with an incredible chipotle mayo.  Please get it and tell me you didn't fall in love! 

Enjoy your next trip!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a Sunday just after opening. I had been looking forward to this for a while and was not disappointed in any way. I've loved almost all of Fat Head's beers that I had previously tried, and those that we had were top notch. The food menu was huge, and it was all reasonably priced. It took us forever to decide what we wanted. If we lived closer, I would probably live here due to the affordability, the great beer and the huge variety of food. The burger I had was excellent, although a touch overcooked from how I ordered it. The portion size was huge and I didn't finish the fries. My wife ordered a pizza, and it was about twice as much as she expected. I helped her with a piece, but that was all I could handle. I definitely recommend stopping at Fat Head's any chance you have. The earlier in the day the better, as it definitely can get packed in the evenings (from what I've heard)."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, good staff but a bit high priced . Parking is scarce during the dinner hours and weekends."}
{"text":"Get to Fatheads. Order Smokehouse Wings (Extra Medium) and prepare for something completely unexpected.

Go ahead. I'll wait."}
{"text":"Great beer! The food is MASSIVE and GREAT! The beer is brewed in house and tastes as great as can be. However; Fathead needs more tv's. If your looking to check out a sports game you might want to get a table by the bar. Like I said great food and beer but if you don't have a tv by the tv good luck. All around a great place."}
{"text":"AMAZING beer and food!

The hubby and I created our own sampler of beer.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and was a great help.  They were some of the best craft brews I've ever had.

For lunch we had an order of 'shrooms (battered mushrooms), a crock of chicken Parmesan soup, and a meathead pizza.  The shrooms were incredible.  The batter was fried perfectly crunchy and was well seasoned.  The soup sounds strange but it was delightful and not as heavy as it sounds.  The pizza was good but the capicola was surprisingly spicy.  

We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love our server Catie. She is a cutie petuttie with a great personality and good service!"}
{"text":"First off, the bar tender was superb. If I owned a place this is exactly how I would want my employees to act. The beer is so good!  I knew that going in already. I had the nachos and they were pretty terrible. Tasted like yesterday's meat, had to be. I did hear people say that the smoked wings were the best part of the menu. Next time."}
{"text":"Good environment. Good food. Tons of selections from various kinds of food and tons of beer. It took me a bit to figure out what to order because there were so many options- it was amazing though."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened.  Great bar grub and beer selection.  As a gal from Pittsburgh, it's only natural that I would love Fat Heats."}
{"text":"Highly overrated.  Gave it several tries.  On my most recent visit, we waited 30 minutes to be seated, even though there were empty tables everywhere.  We didn't get any food on the table for another 40 minutes, so it was an hour and ten minutes from when we arrived to when we actually had something to munch on.  The waiter was nowhere to be found most of the night.  A few times we saw him just standing there, watching the football game on TV.  Almost all the plates got served with horrible, overcooked homemade potato chips (which they refuse to substitute out - I suspect because no one would ever order them otherwise), which were universally disliked by the entire table.  The prices are rather high for the type of dining experience you're getting.  This isn't a fancy restaurant, this is a boisterous, chaotic family-restaurant type environment, with kids running around and playing in the aisles.  I ordered a chicken sandwich which was gigantic and looked amazing, but was far less impressive when I saw that the \"chicken\" was actually frozen factory-made breaded \"chicken\".  And it wasn't just my dish.  Most of the menu item seem to be cobbled together from various pieces of processed food.  If I wanted to eat processed garbage, I'd go get fast food.  I want real ingredients when I eat out, and especially at these prices.  And the other reason for my low rating involves the the ceilings, which are sloped inward with no attempt whatsoever at sound dampening.  To call this place noisy doesn't do it justice.  No, noise doesn't really begin to describe it, it's more like a cacophony.  I found it really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great food and great price.  Huge burgers well worth the $10 bucks.  Excellent service food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Torn about this one.  I had lunch there- lots of delicious food and good beer, great service.

Dinner?-called in for reservation for 4 at 6 pm- told it was a 1 hour wait; showed up 45 minutes later and was told another 30 min delay (OK 1 hr 15 no problem).  After that time was told it was another 45 min (so it would be 2 hr).  15 min later I asked again and was told another hr to hr and 1/2. In the waiting time some people were seated, some were screwed with like us.  We left and walked across the parking lot to Nuevo Acapulca and were eating in 15 min.  We were texted at 8:40 that our table at Fat Heads was ready; we just finished our NA meal and drinks.  Like I said we were torn- lunch- great!   dinner- service sucked"}
{"text":"Fat Head's is a giant restaurant that reminds me of an upscale Applebee's. The rooms are huge, spacious, dimly lit and way overcrowded. Despite the large amount of room, there's still way too many people in this place on a Saturday evening. 

There wasn't all the crap on the walls that Applebee's usually has, but the atmosphere was the same. Maybe an Outback Steakhouse or Winking Lizard would be a better comparison. Whatever they're going for, I didn't love it.

Luckily, the food is way better than Applebee's, even if the atmosphere and décor isn't. The French onion soup was above average and the smoked chicken wings blew me away. Full wings that you have to tear apart yourself, highlighted by a pink smoke ring for authenticity, and topped by a great sauce. 

Next time I'm in, I'm trying the sandwich Maxim called the fifth best in the country - a giant piece of bread stuffed with sausage and perogi!

The beer was decent, but not spectacular. I was slightly intrigued by the fact they have a ton of guest beers on tap to compliment their own. Again, this speaks to the \"commercialized\" feel this place gave me. 

They featured eight of their own beers, all of which I would describe as being above average to very good. The one that sticks out in my mind, though, is the pilsner. It was very true to form, which is hard to find in a country dominated by American lagers; often mistakenly dubbed pilsners.

The service was decent even though they were crazy busy. The one mistake was that I ordered a roasted red pepper soup and got a bowl of French onion instead, but I'm thinking that was the mistake of the people in the back, and I didn't bother to correct her."}
{"text":"By very unpopular opinion, I have to say that I'm not as impressed with Fat Heads as many others are! While I'm sure that there is a specific crowd this place is GREAT for, it's sadly not for me. My husband and children love the place simply for the smoked wings, but even those I have had far better for a much cheaper price. 

It's a bar. Really, the restaurant portion is overcrowded and often filled with people standing and waiting in crowds for drinks and chatting loudly to hear over one another. It doesn't make for the best eating environment, especially when you've got kids (which they happily promote having with you when you come to dine in), and god forbid you want to talk to someone across the table from you. With minimal seating space (the tables only being a good few ft. wide), you end up kicking each other under the tabletop and generally having a difficult time sitting on uncomfortable chairs. 

Often times the food takes a while to get to your table, you can't find your server, and the temperature is either incredibly warm or incredibly cold depending on the season. 

Overall I've yet to have an entirely pleasant experience at this location (and I have been 5+ times) and added on top of the ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS parking, its going to be difficult to sway me at this point. The saving grace here is that the beer is phenomenal and there's lots of flavors for every kind of palate. Sorry but not sorry ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"What do you say when the only major issue is that portion sizes are too large?   Not much!!!

The beer is great and there's a flavor for everyone's tastes.   I'll say they lean a bit on the hoppy side which is not ideal for me but it's the American trendy beer type now.  

There are many excellent bar good menu items.    Basically take the best of a kid menu and tune it up for adults in terms of flavors, spices and toppings.   As I said before, the portion size is massive so don't expect to finish a meal.   I'm someone who hates to waste food, honestly. 

I'm a tough grader and it takes a lot for me to give a five.   I could sit at the bar here for hours or be at a table eating a feast.   Come here and enjoy the crowd."}
{"text":"Flatheads is simply easy and consistent. Yes the portions are huge, yes they have a great selection of award winning beers and nice revolving guest taps yes you will not enjoy it if you are on a diet so stay away! I have been their at least 100 times and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"No just no. Horrible service !!!! When will  they learn it's okay to substitute. I'm the customer I want it me way. Lol"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 places to go for a beer. Excellent selection of beers and food. Sandwiches are huge and the price is great. On my last visit we weren't too hungry so we just opted for fried pickles and their nachos (which use potato as chips) the nachos were huge and delicious. Their beer samplers are also a great addition for the ability to sample their craft beer and see which you would like to have. I ended up getting the Trail head pale ale, a great beer with some grapefruit and citrus notes which are perfect for summer! Overall the food I would give a 4 star but the beer made me go with the 5. Watching the world cup was also easy there as they have a lot of TVs and good seating to accommodate you."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, enormous craft beer selection, gigantic servings of food, and a fun lively atmosphere. Highly recommended restaurant but be sure to sit the appetizers amongst several people!"}
{"text":"I was In Cleveland before, and I couldn't make it here. The locals told me this was one good microbrewery to visit. They were right. The place's atmosphere is really relax. It was very busy. The bar  as huge and they have a lot of beer on tap. We had a few tastings and the one that stood out the most was the arriba jalapeño lager. The beer was incredible. Just like any other lager it was crispy. Full-flavored well balance of malts. However, the jalapeño gives this beer distinctive and unique smell complementing with a nice slight heat fish! They really nailed the flavor with the jalapeño!"}
{"text":"I've been encountering so many good restaurants in Cleveland lately, that I'm almost now searching for faults so that I can stop doling out so many 4/5 star reviews. Regardless, I found few faults with Fatheads. Great prices, HUGE portion sizes, and delicious food. I had the fun guy burger, as well as tasted some of the barbecue wings and the pizza margherita. I felt that the burger could have used a bit something more to make it stand out, perhaps a bit more spread, another sauce, or another ingredient to break up the texture. Even though I'm not much of a beer drinker, this place has a massive selection of beers on tap and cask ales, which is a big plus for those that are."}
{"text":"Wow this place is pretty descent for the homie feeling and yhe sandwiches are nice. Dec. 26 we order the rootbeer and the cinamon was very strong not sure if i like it or not. But overall our waitress is nice
.."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon. Was a nice atmosphere with families eating food and then half the bar full. Sat at the bar and got service quickly. No rushes and no delays. The owner ended up coming in and saying hello and making sure everything was okay. Plenty of different beers to choose from. I didn't give it a 4-star because I didn't get any food so I don't know how it is. I will definitely be back and next time try the food."}
{"text":"I must have been here on the wrong day. We were out shopping and decided to stop in for a burger. The place was packed and it was pretty cool inside. I don't know what my burger was called but it was just a basic bacon cheeseburger nothing fancy. It took almost an hour to get our burgers and about an hour after eating it I was sick. After my first bite I said it tasted kinda funky but I kept eating it. That was a big mistake. 

Several of my friends go here often and love it. They say the food is usually great and they have a huge selection of craft beers. I'm not one to blast a place with one star reviews but after a good 24 hours with my face in a toliet it's pretty tough to give them anymore."}
{"text":"This place was great! One of the first nice days and we got a table for four on the patio. The drink list is huge and the menu was even bigger! Our waiter was super accommodating and patient while we took probably too much time deciding on things to eat and drink. The food turned out to be really good. I was honestly expecting sub par tasteless food only because the menu was so insanely big that it seemed impossible for everything to be good. If I had to complain I would say the cheese sticks were probably frozen and then were cooked enough, but over all the beer was great and the food was also. Would recommend!!! 
P.S they let your dog on the patio too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great local brewery.  Very busy place, get there early.  I like better beers and Fat heads delivers.  The Goggle Fogger is always a fan favorite.  Pizza is a good homemade new york style pie. Daily specials are usually very good."}
{"text":"I used to love Fat Heads Brewery a few years ago, but every time I've been in there for the last year the staff is not friendly and I am not pleased with the food. I just had the worst fish fry I've ever had in my life. The fish was so overcooked and greasy that I had to soak it up with multiple napkins. To top it off they smothered it over my French fries, which now made them extremely greasy. I didn't even finish a piece and was ready for the check. Any great food service staff would see that a plate is barely touched and would've asked what was wrong. I will never be back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Terrific beer, great food... Go on a nice day and use the patio..."}
{"text":"Sandwiches that are bigger than the average person's dome

Solid brews 

Usually packed, but can slip in on not peak times

The chicken little is my go 2

Underrated pizza and wings

Only bad thing is that it is in North Olmstead."}
{"text":"!!!!PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE!!!!* Being gluten free, beer isn't exactly my thing. So, I don't ever come here looking to try the newest brew. I have been here many times though because I have found a few menu items that I absolutely LOVE....and it keeps me coming back for more. This building is the old Danny Boy's location (think open air farmers market and bakery.) I love the rustic feel that it has here and they really kept the essence of how Danny Boy's interior used to feel. Amazing vaulted ceiling with exposed brick and wood beams and industrial concrete floors. Really lends to that \"brewhouse\" feel.

I get two things each and every single time I come here:

1) Smokehouse wings: These beauts are truly a clucking amazing find. Whole wings, not pieces. Nice and meaty and always fall off the bone tender and juicy. I LOVE the fact these are smoked and not fried. That smokey flavor is really what gives these an edge. The honey chipotle and BBQ are both stellar sauces to get on these wings. I also ask for the killer ranch...but BEWARE, your nose will run. For me, the more my nose runs, the more my mouth burns and the more my eyes water.....the better. Makes for a mucus fest of epic proportions, but makes me smile!

2) Housemade chips: Sweet mother of monkey milk. These things are a religious experience. Crispy, thick sliced potatoes....deep fried in a vat of yummy oily goodness. Seasoned perfectly too. Dip these in the killer ranch too. Foodasm. Plain and simple.

This last time I tried:

1) The pulled pork chili: Wow, this is not at all what I expected....and not in a bad way at all. It was not spicy (which I hoped for) but the flavors were there for sure. Just the right amount of meat and beans too. Awesome if you ask me.

The service here is always great. I have yet to have a server I didn't like and the food always comes out in a relatively expedient fashion. The place is as clean as one can expect a bar to be and the bathrooms have plenty of space to accommodate. I love that they use the NoWait app, makes it easy to check in remotely and not have to stand and wait for hours (which is common here.)

* The parking here is HORRIBLE! When this place is busy, there is NOWHERE to park. And, do not try parking near Drug Mart. They will tow your car."}
{"text":"In my view this is the best craft brewey in Cleveland.  The HeadHunter IPA is just the perfect balance of hops and citrus tone.  Multiple layers of flavor.  Food is excellent.  Today they have Lake Erie Perch."}
{"text":"While not a Cleveland institution (they're based in Pittsburgh) Fatheads is definitely gaining ground here in a big way. Their line of beers easily rivals those of local favorites Great Lakes and Brew Kettle and the recent opening of their production brewery in Middleburg Heights is a testament to their success. Now I'm not one that's terribly impressed by beer awards, after all, I don't need a bunch of haughty beer judges to tell me what's good,  Fatheads has plenty of them - GABF, World Beer Cup, the list goes on. I guess what I'm tryin' to say is that they know their way around a mash tun and if you want some of the best beer in NE Ohio, nay, the Midwest, you owe it to yourself to pay them a visit. Oh yeah, and I do agree with the other Yelper who said their Christmas Ale rivals GLBC - actually, I think it's better.

The restaurant, sorry, brewhouse and saloon, is quite sizable. You enter through the back and you're immediately greeted by shining stainless steel and copper and the smell of boiling hops and malt. One whiff and you know you're in a brewhouse. I love it. Since we don't visit late in the evenings or on weekends (crowds aren't our thing) I can only attest to the atmosphere when we've been there - normally 6ish on a weekday. We're always greeted immediately when we walk in and have never had to wait for a table. 

We've dined here three times in the last several months so I guess you'd call us regulars. The menu (http://fatheadscleveland.com/Fat%20Heads%20Menu.pdf) is pretty extensive at 7 pages and it has just about everything you can imagine a place like Fatheads would have - salads, pizza, wings, burgers, and headwiches. Yeah, Headwiches. Headwiches are the signature sandwich of Fatheads and they are massive. Easily able to feed two (or one Adam Richman) they come in about a dozen different styles like the Southside Slopes with kielbasa topped with fried pierogies, American cheese, grilled onions and horseradish sauce and the Beauty and the Beasty with pulled pork in their spicy Beasty BBQ Sauce. Topped with creamy cole slaw, pickles and raw onions. Sure it's a kitschy novelty but it's worth getting one just so you can say you did. They are also moderately priced with just about all menu items falling in the $9-$10 range.

Overall, Fatheads gets my seal of approval. As others have mentioned the food can range from the ho-hum (I'd pass on the potato chip \"nachos\" and the smoked prime dip) to the holy hell I've gotta have that again (the triple bypass burger is a work of art and the 4-onion honey and ale soup is worth bathing in) and the service is, like every other place, completely dependent upon who you are stuck/blessed with that night. Just keep in mind that your servers are in the \"hospitality\" industry - how happy do you expect them to be? Our experiences have been pleasant and our service good. Your results may vary.

P.S.
They do have the whole annoying \"fries only come with the burgers\" rule which I don't necessarily get. But it is their place and I suppose their entitled to do whatever the hell they want. As long as they keep the beer flowing I'll look the other way."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sandwiches and Beer!!! My fiancé and I went here last night with another couple LOVED it! We ordered the fried mushrooms to start, a HUGE pile of full sized mushrooms fried in beer batter and a horseradish dipping sauce. For dinner I got the Head Banger sandwich, so delicious! Banger sausage, fried egg, bacon, tomato, chipotle mayo. I loved it, but it was so large I could only eat 1/2. Great service and my fiancé loved the beers too!"}
{"text":"Good food - cheese sticks and prime rib dip were on point. Unfortunately, there's a pretentious rule that you can't sub fries for chips, and it's apparently not communicated to patrons politely. Not everyone enjoys thick-cut chips. Bartender service was inconsistent; one rolled his eyes over a request of ranch while others offered prompt, courteous service. We waited 15 minutes to cash out the tab. Not many patrons enjoy feeling they're at the subservience of the establishment. Important to note, the bartenders had plenty of time to check their phones repeatedly..."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal and the beer selection is very good. They brew their own beers. I recommend the bumble berry, which comes with fresh blueberries floating inside the beer. The service however is very slow here. The wait to place an order, get more drinks, and get my check was unbearable. Dinner took about 2 1/2 hours on a Thursday at 7pm. Overall I would check out this place if you have never been, but make sure you schedule yourself a lot of time. You are not going to be in and out of here."}
{"text":"I went to the Fat Heads in Pittsburgh a few years back and enjoyed it. And since Head Hunter IPA has gone viral in the craft beer-world, I decided I needed to check out the Cleveland location and see what else they were brewing up.

While the Pittsburgh location is in prime real-estate down on the South Side, the Cleveland location is out in a nondescript suburb, next to a Dairy Queen and in front of a strip mall. So minus one star for the lame suburban location with no decent transportation except for driving (a real problem when going to a brewery to drink a lot of beer), but once you get over that, everything else is pretty great.

The menu is mostly bar-type food - sandwiches, wings, etc. The Headwiches are excellent. The homemade chips that come with them are OK, though I typically prefer fries. Overall the food is above-average for what it is, but hardly gourmet.

Atmosphere inside is OK. The bar area is great and you get clear views of the brewing room and fermentation tanks as you drink; the \"dining room\" area feels a lot less inviting for some reason. 

The real reason to come to Fat Heads is for the beer. Lots of great stuff on draft. Most of it is way better than your average Rock Bottom or Gordon Biersch type brewpub. They had a cask version of Head Hunter as well, which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I can't describe how good this place is. You really just have to try it.  They know how to make beer and have all kinds of interesting options!!!(If anyone in charge over there is reading this could you make granny gear pilsner more widely available??? it's better than jack straw and turntable pils) FOOD IS INSANE.  My go-to orders are the fried shrooms, smokehouse wings (beasty bbq), and the cuyahoga burger or the bay of pigs. Get a side of the killer ranch with everything. This is the restaurant I frequent most and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Given other choices in the area, Fat Heads is one of the better options and it's obvious by how busy it ALWAYS is. We waited an hour at 5:00PM on a Saturday and there was no Happy Hour. 

Was it worth the wait? In my opinion, no. Fat Heads has great beer and OK food. They have a huge menu that could use a trim down so they could focus on doing a few things REALLY well versus a bunch of things just alright. 

I ordered a french onion soup and a ruben. The soup was bland and mostly bread and cheese. The sandwich was enormous, but lacked flavor. The corned beef was tough and fatty. There was barely any kraut or sauce. I didn't finish it. 

Dad ordered a smoked french dip and liked it. Brother ordered the Pistrami Primo which was huge. The pistrami was better than the corned beef. 

I the future, I'd suggest to stick to burgers or wings. Seeing those being deliver to other tables looked like better options. Their pizzas looked disappointing, 

Our waitress was pretty good especially for how busy she was. 

Overall NOT worth an hour wait. Pick up a growler of the Alpenglow to enjoy at home."}
{"text":"Fat Heads is always fantastic!! Had to wait a bit but I didn't mind! Had the nachos and the DLA headwich which never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome sandwiches! This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to have dinner in the area. The menu probably has 40+ sandwiches on it so lots of choices. The smoked wings are very good and are large in size. This place is a brewery too so, they have a lot of good beer on hand. Not just Fatheads own brewed beer but, many other craft beers on tap as well. 

So whether your looking to have dinner and drinks or your just looking for an oversized delicious sandwich, this is a great place to go for lunch or dinner. Most sandwiches range from $8-$11 but they are huge and are worth the money. 

My favorite sandwich that i've tryed so far is the \"SouthSide Slopes Sandwich\". It was rated by Maxim Magazine as being the 5th best sandwich in America!"}
{"text":"Miss this place if ever back in Cleveland this will be a must hit! Good food too. I enjoyed filling up my growler there tues it is like 5 bucks. The Tree Hugger is by far my favorite brew they have!"}
{"text":"Beer flight was great way to sample their various brews. Personal favorite was \"Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale\"!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been there, GO. This place, though usually packed, has a great atmosphere and the BEST beer. I love to get the fish and chips which can feed two. Their smoked wings and delish burgers NEVER disappoint. #TeamFatheadBrewery"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fresh salads! Awesome beer! I love fat heads!!!!! The service is great. The perfect place to watch games. Certainly a family/kid friendly establishment. The beer samplings/tastings are very good and a nice size."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the portions are HUGE. I haven't been able to finish my meal when go. Their burgers and sandwiches are really good. The craft beer is excellent. Very casual and it gets busy on the weekends. They have a pool table which is great when you're waiting."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place. A hidden little gem. Not any more. While the food and beer have stayed the same, the atmosphere hasn't. They have recently added a bottling machine to the brewery. It is unbearable! So loud, you can't have a conversation. Do not go here anymore. Go to the one in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"I have been to several breweries over the year and I can honestly say this is my favorite, by far. 
Great beer and equally great food. Way to go Fat Head!"}
{"text":"Crazy beers on tap .16 just from guests , 18 beers from fat heads. Friendly staff .Even the people that were not my bartender were still friendly .That's what every brewery needs . This place will never fail if it keeps having good beer and great staff . Smoke house wings were insane good and a very solid price for what you get ."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim just passing through Greater Cleavland. The menu was impressive, the fries were fantastic, the burger was flavorful and perfectly cooked. I loved how spacious the restaurant portion was. It was so nice not to have tables practically stacked on top of each other. My husband loved his giant pork sandwich. Our server was pleasant and attentive. Fat Head's will be a regular stop for us when we are in the Cleavland area!"}
{"text":"Love Fatheads. 
Great beer. 
Headhunter, Bonehead, Goggle Fogger, Bumbleberry, Hop JuJu, Trailhead are all incredible beers. 
Great food.
Always get the Beauty and the Beasty. The smokehouse wings are excellent. They're messy as hell though. Don't wear white anything. 
Service is good and knowledgable. Great place to experiment with beers. Ask for a suggestion and a sample if you don't know what to try. 
Cheers all!!"}
{"text":"Was headed to Sandusky Ohio and wanted to stop in to FatHeads for lunch.  As a native of Pittsburgh I'm familiar with FatHeads and love their beer.  This location did not disappoint.  Their were 18 FatHeads beers on tap.  Some of the regulars and some hard to find.  My mom, wife and I spilt two fish and chips and their was a lot of leftover.  This kids and grilled cheese and loved it.  The growlers to go was great and the gift shop was cool.  Only thing was they did not sell bottles just growlers."}
{"text":"Heaping portions of really average, somewhat tasteless food -- that was our experience of Fat Heads. If you go for the beer (and we didn't), it may be a different story. Food was really uninspired in all 4 of our meals. Just really MEH."}
{"text":"Fat Heads is a really great place to hang out with friends or family and enjoy a nice brewery atmosphere with great beer. I have eaten dinner here twice as well and the food is much better than most comparable places. The portion sizes are huge and prices are reasonable. They have a pretty extensive beer menu too.  

The best thing I've had was the smoked whole wings. Wow! I am still craving them again. And they are huge, the order of 3 wings for $6.99 with celery and blue cheese dressing was my meal!  

They have a full parking lot in back too, so that's always nice!"}
{"text":"3rd time here and my service was as not up to par. Hank was our server and he was not personable and could care less. Came and checked on us but didn't care about our questions. Beer is good, I think the menu needs to be larger with more options like steak and less sandwiches. I did the advance checkin with yelp and that was amazing and a time saver. Would I come back, yes. But will it be often, no."}
{"text":"Stopped for a beer before dealing with the family, like to ask my partner in crime what my beer tastes like, got the Bonehead Imperial Red, she indicated \"tastes like resin of pine in mud\" which is exactly what I was hoping on Christmas Eve seriously great beer and yes that's what I think it tasted like!?  Keeping kicking arse with unique flavors."}
{"text":"Stopped here during our cross country trip and while the location wasn't great, the beer, cider and food was good. My boyfriend ordered the Full Cleveland sandwich and said it reminded him of the kielbasa and sauerkraut from Poland. Would definitely recommend this sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried Bean Me Up Imperial coffee stout, very good for coffee fans. Samples are a little pricey, food was good. One late night I was disappointed when I found out they close at 11pm. Worth trying."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Fat Head's on a recent trip to Cleveland and were definitely impressed! We tried pretty much every beer on tap (over 10 of their own brews at that time) and liked almost every one. The Headhunter IPA was definitely among our faves, which doesn't surprise me seeing how many awards it's won.

For food, we started with the Smokehouse wings (delicious) and each enjoyed our sandwich as well. The pub chips are excellent. And it also helped to have a very attentive, friendly and well-spoken bartender. His name was Kevin - great guy. So long story short, I would for sure check this place out if you're going to be in/around the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"If you're going to eat - go early and go hungry! Wings are very good. Sandwiches are MONSTERS! Flatbreads are good too. We actually prefer the bar seats - less wait time and we like to see their beer taps. Speaking of beer - bring your growler cause you're gonna wanna take some beer home with your leftovers. No growler? You can buy one there. PS: Last time I checked there is a gift shop discount at the bottom of your receipt you can use to buy your growler (not good on the fill up though)."}
{"text":"Nice environment.  I had an Avocado Ranch Chicken Pita and a Jack Straw Pils.  They were perfect.  Thanks. PWC"}
{"text":"First time here, heard great things about the place.  Love the beer, but thought lets see what the restaurant has to offer.  

It was alright not horrible.  We had a large group, my food was warm-coldish when I got it, disappointed in that. 

-They do not take reservations, BUT, if you download the 'no wait' app you can put your name in as soon as you are within 25+ miles of the place.  So that helps.

-Inside is cool, all fat head related attire.  Id like to have them actually offer a tour like great lakes does.

-Food was not bad, similar to cheesecake factory menu, and MELT portions.  

-I had the  Triple Bypass Burger ($13, not 9.99 like YELP menu states)  It was ok, you tasted more burger meat than anything else, burger wasn't seasoned 

-Service- very good

Not 5/5 because:
-Prices a little steep, thought for selling their own beer, they would be cheaper
-Food was warm/cold, burger was ok, not enough flavor
-No reservations

Id go here again to give it another shot before calling it quits."}
{"text":"Love Fatheads.  Despite its large location, there is almost always a wait.  Put your name in ahead of time if you can.  The great beer selection is a given, but they also have an overwhelming menu with a vast array of choices.  My personal favorite is the pulled pork burrito which combines my two favorites-- bbq and burritos!"}
{"text":"Let me rephrase, I'm a fan with conditions.

The house beers are actually pretty solid. We tried all of them via their inexpensive yet generous 4.75 oz pours and there wasn't a clunker in the bunch. It was nice to give my tastebuds a reminder of the summer to come with their peppy Heffeweiss and the doppelbock was lovely cold weather option. Even my cynical beer snob self was reluctantly won over by the blueberry beer, which I had for dessert. 

Caveat: If you're on a diet, want to eat healthy, crave a salad and/or don't want to die of a myocardial infarction right there under the dart board, you may want to avoid the menu in its entirety. It's fried, it's enormous, let's face it - it's why we're fat dot com. 

My fish and chips was pretty solid right down to the house-made tartar. My friend's pot roast sandwich (you read that right) was the size of your six month old baby's head and that is no joke. Service was attentive and friendly, the prices were pretty fair and while the menu is really overwhelming, it's a great spot for groups and beer nerds. Come to think of it, groups of beer nerds."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and unique setting for a restaurant and brewery since this use to be a farmers market. I love almost all of their beers, both the quality and selection are great for any beer enthusiast. The headwiches in terms of food are what make this place very popular. They are as advertised, very large and the size of a small head, but also very delicious. Their onion rings are also amazing as they are tossed in a homemade beer batter that also have some heat to it making them much different from any other beer batter I have had. Make sure if you are going there to get there early as waits can be long, but in the mean time you can always stand by the bar and have a few while you wait."}
{"text":"If you want some great great food and great beer this is your place.  The place was packed but we did not have to wait for a seat. The menu is HUGE, like you could count it as one of your kids summer reading books!  I settled on the Cuban, tell them to hold(also suggested by the waiter) the suace/mustard.  One is a super hot wing sauce and the other honey mustard.  I swapped it for their wasabi whole grain mustard, which was perfect.  The sandwiches are big, ladies you can easily split one.  Their Fuzzy Wuzzy beer is great for a hot summer night.  Their beer flight is 8 healthy samples and well worth to try a range of what they have. Oh and they have cute swag."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and in massive portions but I wanted to write this review to comment on the best service I've had in years. I think her name was Sherry or Sheryl or something? She was wonderfully attentive, helpful, and welcoming. 

Go for the food, stay for the Sher(yl/ry)"}
{"text":"Just wow...I'm a beer snob and they don't have a beer I don't like. Food selection is great too!"}
{"text":"I'm torn with this one, you guys. 

It was my first time here, I opted for chicken fingers and a side salad. I know--boring... and probably not the best thing to order to see if a restaurant really shines. Obviously I wasn't \"wowed\" by this selection because really it was just your ordinary ingredients. The chicken fingers were most likely Sysco brand, frozen. Whatever. 

I did get to try some appetizers--the pretzel sticks were OK and so were the fried pickles. My sister got down on some nachos and I didn't hear any complaints from her. My friends like the smoked chicken wings, but my guy did not. And honestly, I don't think I would have either. The sauces were too sweet for my palette--and the wings were full chicken wings. The whole thing--it was huge! I like crispy flats, vinegary sauces--and smoked anything really isn't my thing. 

The service was good, but the wait was super-long. I didn't try any beers, but my sister was all about this Zeus Juice? She was a huge fan. 

It's not that I wouldn't come back, in fact, I probably would just so I could review something more \"signature\" on their menu. But am I in a rush to? Meh... probably not."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches (headwich's) the call em. Busy place with lots of craft beers. Great place to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"Second time going here for lunch and the food was as good as the first. The service wasn't great, but above average. The menu also has a huge variety."}
{"text":"I love FatHeads! The food comes in large portions, and is always top notch. They have a huge menu with a lot of options. 

The only catch is you cannot sub fries for chips, which is a bummer. No one wants chips... Would be 5 stars otherwise!

None the less, if you need a great place to eat- go to FatHeads."}
{"text":"Four of us sat at the bar on a weeknight to watch the Olympics.
Server was busy but good
Nachos: plate of their potato chips (which are tasty and good), ground beef, jalapenos, tomato chunks, and covered in a baseball-stadium-like nacho cheese: we were pretty disappointed. I was hoping for a better mix of ingredients, of which their was little, including no beans, guacamole, salsa (just a few small chunks of tomato). And the nacho cheese was just cheap and gross - though if you like nacho cheese, you'll love these. I like real cheese and quality ingredients. This was cheap and tasted that way. Their chips are good though."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches, huge portions.  We shared the \"Steakout\"--spicy and good ."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an anomaly, but the root beer floats are pathetic. The root beer to ice cream ratio was completely off. A tall glass of root beer with a single scoop of ice cream floating on the top. That is not a root beer float, that's an ice cream float. Thumbs down Fatheads. However your buffalo wings a super yummy."}
{"text":"Had a weekday (Wednesday) dinner at Fat Head's.  The place was fairly full, but we didn't have to wait for a table.  There clearly wasn't enough parking to accommodate such a large and popular eatery, and I can imagine that it would be hell on really busy days.

We started out with some appetizers:  Smoky BBQ wings and Deep Fried Pierogies (accompanied with a side of sour cream).  It's hard to miss with appetizers like those, and both of them were really good.  For dinner, I got the South Side Slopes which, as the menu will inform you, was voted the #5 Best Sandwich in America by culinary reporting giant Maxim magazine.  I found this a little surprising because, as a subscriber to this magazine (and ostensibly for articles such as this), I must have somehow missed (or been distracted away from) this piece about best sandwiches in America.  How odd . . . .

In all seriousness, the sandwich is pretty good, but I think more so as a spectacle than an actual sandwich.  Biting down on to a double layer of kielbasa topped with American cheese, horsey sauce, and onions is every bit as tasty as it sounds.  I thought, though, that adding the pierogies was a little overboard, and the sandwich is substantially less exciting if you find yourself in the unenviable position of only having left some pierogies in between two pieces of bread.

The beers at Fat Head's are quite good.  I first tried the Christmas Ale which, inevitably, has to be compared to Great Lakes Brewing Company's own Christmas Ale.  I personally prefer the GLBC take, primarily due to its stronger (and spiceier, but not in the \"hot\" kind of way) flavor.  The Fat Head's version seemed to me like a dulled version of the popular GLBC beer.  Maybe they should put some cinnamon sugar on the rim of the glasses!  The Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale is excellent.  The taste and aroma made me think of eating blueberry waffles, surely pegging this beer within the top-five breakfast-tasting beers in America.  When is that article coming Maxim?!?"}
{"text":"Beer was amazing.  I had a flight and didn't find one that didn't impress me.  The food was delicious and in huge portions.  Get the smoked wings for sure."}
{"text":"Farrrrrrrr from impressed. You can get better food from anywhere. The place was really cool, large, and festive but the food was very mediocre. No one finished their food or took boxes to go. When this happens with my family you know we were farrrrr from impressed. Burger buns were hard and the cheesestake was not impressive. What sucked so much is that we were dying to eat here and left wishing we hadn't wasted our money."}
{"text":"Holy crap...
I went in wondering how bad this was going to be because quite frankly I didn't trust them...
So on the menu...Burgers get ff and everything else gets our homemade potato chips and we won't substitute...Really? Didn't think a restaurant was an Oligarchy but I was going to order a burger anyway so pbtppppppppbt....
Ordered a Triplebypass medium rare and dang! came out perfect and DELISH!!!!!!!
I got picked on cause I was the first one done and had the biggest burger...
Yeah so the inmates had to bust my b--ugh--chops about that but it was REALLY good and again....
Simple done right....
Yeah if we choose to head to the West Side again Fatheads will be in the loop!!"}
{"text":"Eating at Fat Heads leads to a Fat Belly. I enjoyed a nice business luncheon at Fat Heads today, and it was my first visit. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. The beer menu looked great, but I stuck to business for today. The menu was an interesting read unto itself, with all sorts of unique and uniquely described sandwiches (or Headwiches as they call them), burgers and melts. Despite all of the options to choose from, I ended up going with the Prime Rib and Bacon Club melt. The homemade chips were fantastic; although I'd probably only give the sandwich a 3 because the prime rib was a tad fatty and the bacon wasn't as crisp as I like it. But it was still delicious - and the overall experience definitely warrants a 4-star rating. I can't wait to go back (for a non-business occasion)!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food, great beer, at average prices!  Considering the fact that you should probably really get two meals out of anything you order, this is a very reasonably priced menu!  Headwiches are enormous, as are all of their other sandwiches; salads I'm pretty sure use an entire head of lettuce (downside is that it is iceberg, except the chicken spinach salad); most apps are large enough to share with a group, or be a meal shared by two people!  Don't forget to try some of their pizzas and smokehouse wings, you will not be disappointed!!

The beer here is outstanding, and they typically have 12-15 house beers on tap at any given time, plus guest beers.  I believe they have about 36 taps, plus a beer engine that serves 2 more.  This is truly a destination for people into trying craft beers in the Cleveland area!  Out of towners should really make an effort to get here for the beer alone, if you are really into quality beer!

A couple precautions to enhance your dining experience: if you have a large group, go early, or you will have a wait!  The typical dining hours are pretty busy, and an hour and a half or two hour wait, for a moderate group of people, is not uncommon on Friday and Saturday evenings.  If you have kids, go early as well, unless you have some way to occupy their time.  They do have a game room with pool tables, dart boards, and an old style bar bowling machine, but it would be better to just go early, especially if they're having a private party, which they host in the game room.  It also gets pretty loud in there, so if you're looking for a nice, quiet evening, this may not be your best choice!  One last very minor downside: they sell growlers of their beer for you to take home, but they no longer sell bottled beer for retail out of the North Olmsted location!  You have to go the production brewery for those, but that will be another review!

The staff is very friendly, and knowledgeable when it comes to their beers, so don't be afraid to let them recommend something for you!  Overall, a very fun, and laid back place to enjoy the company of good friends!

They now use the No Wait app, so you can jump in virtual line before you arrive, and you can remotely to check to see how long the wait will be.  Downside with the app, you have to be within 10 miles to check in because it uses your phone's GPS, so if you're coming in from farther away than 10 miles, you can't do it.  It is a time saver if you're close, and pretty accurate time wise for seating."}
{"text":"First of all, this place was jammin' on a Thursday night.  Easily near 90% capacity from what I saw...took that as a good sign.

Seated at a large circular-style booth in the back which was perfect because I had three small kids with me.  Perfect seating arrangement.

Service was outstanding.  Charlie, our server, was very friendly and helpful.

Apps - shared some mild buffalo wings and onion rings.  Wings were solid, onion rings were very tasty, and as Charlie warned, very spicy.  Probably ate more of those than I should have.

Main - kids meals were big hits.  Triple Bypass Burger and Head Banger for my wife and I.  Burger was very tasty, Head Banger was decent.  Neither could be finished due to how big the sandwiches were.

Beer - I had a couple of the Pumpkin Ales, which were very good.  Wife had the pilsner, which was also pretty good.

If we lived closer, we'd eat here frequently.  Had a very good meal with happy kids, and the bill was very reasonable.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is second year we've gone here after the IX Center Auto Show. The food is unique and very good food. And they give good sized portions. Service has always been good. Do the call ahead seating. This time I had the Southern Slopes Sandwich, voted #5 Best Sandwich in USA by Maxim. Also had the fried mushrooms and Crawfish soup. All were excellent!  Had the fish and burgers last year. All also excellent. 
Because I have a 65 mile drive home I haven't been able to try the beers. Bar area did have a slight \"college bar beer\" smell but, place seemed clean overall. Going to take a designated driver next year. 
Will definitely go back. 
I have never given 5 Star so this is about the highest rating I give. It is a great place to eat after going to an IX Center event and gets you cack to highway in low traffic after."}
{"text":"Dude awesome beers here and perfect location.  I love the headhunter. I come in from LA and fatheads is my first stop.  Cubano is a solid choice for a sandwich. Usually it is very busy."}
{"text":"The beer is always excellent, the food is reasonably priced and portions are more than generous. That being said the food isn't exactly low carb or low calorie but let's be honest you go for the hand crafted beers and everyone deserves a cheat meal once in a while."}
{"text":"I wanted to drop a note to say this is one of my favorite places.  as a foodie, and a master of taste....Fatheads does it right in a fun environment.  

pros:  food, beer, staff.......breaded mushrooms are amazing

cons:  might be a little pricey for some....but splurge.

this guy is a fan!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet place for dinner, Fat Heads is not the place for you. If you're looking for a restaurant with some healthier options, Fat Heads is not the place either. Ifyou're looking for a place with good energy, hearty menu selections, and some of the best micro brews in Cleveland, then look no further than Fat Heads. 

I've been to Fat Heads to dine on two separate occasions, and while I would not recommend indulging in their dinner/lunch menu items on a daily (or even weekly) basis, the food itself is great! I've had two different sandwiches, and both times I could only finish half. HUGE portions of all the unhealthy goodness you can stand! 

Fat Heads is known for the beer and beer is where they really shine. Their Head Hunter IPA is one of the best IPAs around. Bumble Berry is another year-round favorite; a honey beer with a slight blueberry finish. Not my cup of tea, but really good nevertheless. There are also a number of seasonals to choose from, and for those not so inclined to drinking micro-brews, they offer a selection of domestics as well, which I think is a smart play on their part. 

The ambience here is loud. That's about all I can say. Service is friendly, and attentive. We had a party of 14 one time and 8 the other, and neither time did the service miss a beat. 

As I said, if you want a fun place to have some good beers and some good food that you probably shouldn't eat, then Fat Heads is your place. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Everything in moderation, right?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brewery in Cleveland. Their goggle fogger and Cinnamon Toast Crunch beers are my favorite! Their food is great but the portions are LARGE. The service is always friendly. If you expect to come on the weekend, be prepared to wait an hour or more for your table. The game room makes the wait more bearable if it isn't booked, or for when you're just going to hang out with friends. Lastly, it's pretty pricey. I usually pay about 80-100 for a dinner for two."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! Great beer, love getting a flight. Best fried pickles, fried mushrooms and smoked chicken artichoke dip!!"}
{"text":"HEAD HUNTER!!!
garlic fries are too good.  All the food at Fatheads is amazing - pulled pork, burgers, Killer chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"The beer here is great and that's about it. We have never not had to wait for a table which isn't really their fault but it's frustrsting to see several open tables and people not being sat. The food is just OK - it's definitly \"bar food\". We probably won't be back again for these reasons but we do still enjoy the beer."}
{"text":"Come here for beer stay for beer and then take home some beer but if you eat be prepared for a gut bomb meal that doesn't offer much in the way of a lighter fare"}
{"text":"Great beers....Gogglefogger is one of the best.  They describe it as a banana bubblegum taste but dont let that scare you.  Ask for a sample and try it.  Huge portions.  Sandwiches are called Headwiches because they are the size of your head.  One great perk is ALL appetizers are half off after 9pm everyday."}
{"text":"How have I just realized that I never reviewed this place.  As far as what I ate when I was there over the summer, I honestly don't remember but I do remember it was delicious and I loved the home made chips that came with it.  Our server was good as we had no complaints about that.  The beer.....  Perfect.  I love all of their beers, does this place make even one beer that is not good?????  As I'm a huge hop head, I love all of their IPA's.  They really are the masters of hoppy beers.  Of course, head hunter is always perfect.  My favorite beer I've ever had, and I've had beers from all across the country and the world, and the best is by far hop juju.  It really is the perfect beer.  I can't say enough great things about Fat Heads, and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"One of our go-to spots. The Headhunter IPA and Beauty and the Beasty, are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Everything here is big. The sandwiches, the drinks, the growlers. There is another like-named place in PA but this is not exactly affiliated with them. 

As dear readers know, I do not drink, but my companions did - and really liked the beer that they sampled (please don't ask - one was \"fruitier\" than the other \"hoppier\" one). 

Got the 
 - Codfather - Lotsa for fish - lotsa bread
 - Buffalo Calamari - the table consensus was the dish was a little spicy 

ONLY complaint - they give cold chips with hot food - LOL.  But the sammy made up for it.

Try it and pick up growler to go - TSA approved!"}
{"text":"Christmas Ale & smokehouse wings it does not get any better than this."}
{"text":"I would have rated this place higher if they didn't charge for a sample taste of their brews. $2.50 for a sample...c'mon! Granted it was a 5oz glass, but when I say I want to \"try a taste\", don't hand me 5oz and then charge me for it. 
The food was good. Not great, but good. Portions are very large, so you do get your money's worth. Atmosphere is very good. I'm just very hung up on the sample charge."}
{"text":"Amazing, portions are crazy big!  You could share!  Will save going back for a while though.  Still stuffed!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best wings I've ever had. Great beer selection, great food, and chill atmosphere. I went here in 2012 and I still think about their wings. I wish there was one in LA!"}
{"text":"Just consistently good. Yes there are long waits almost every night of the week, hmmm must be a reason. The beer is outstanding, food is too big in a good way and service is great."}
{"text":"I enjoy good beer, good food and great company, this place has all three! Visited on a Saturday around 8:30pm. We had a 40 min wait, but three spots at the bar opened up and we scooted right into them. I sampled the Blueberry beer an ended up buying a six pack to bring home. Enjoyed the Pils, pizza and the Smokehouse wings. If you enjoy craft beer, this is a great place. Only open for the last 4 years, but a huge success! Now, if only I can find the Blueberry beer in Michigan! Ps. The bartenders are super nice and cute too."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food has been consistently good and there's a lot of it! Ingredients are quality and they don't skimp. Staff members are upbeat, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere is unpretentious and upbeat. It's also fun sampling all of the beers"}
{"text":"This a great local brewery.  Fun place for anyone especially out of towners.  The bumbleberry beer was refreshing and the sampler size was well worth 1.50$. The food list was as expansive as the drink menu.  The sandwiches here are enormous, think Melt size and dont be surprised if you have to take half home.  They are know for their smoked wings which I'll have to try next time."}
{"text":"Beer is great, the food even though they have a lot of unique things on the menu have always been average at best. My wife and I will come for dome apps and beer but pass on the food."}
{"text":"It's okay.  I don't care about beer.  Their menu is big enough so that everyone can find something but probably not if you are trying to eat healthy.  It's a bar.  Sure they have salads but they are boring and not interesting at all.  At the same time it's pretty cheap.  We would go back if we were in the neighborhood but it's not the kind of place we would go out of our way to get to."}
{"text":"Charlie is the newfound glory of the Fatheads, North Olmsted location!! He says he's been here for years, but we have never had the pleasure of his amazing skills thus far, and we have frequented this establishment for many many years!! The reputation for the No Olm bartenders, I think, is typical of crass, entitlement... Charlie has put that to rest tonight.  I truly believe he could build the rep back! Breath of fresh air!! Friendly, knowledgeable, and just works naturally to make the guests happy."}
{"text":"I have been to Fat Heads about 20+ times. I have never been overly impressed with the service or the food, but the beer is awesome. My staples are the Bumbleberry Blueberry beer, and the Head Hunter IPA. I really think that they're a little overpriced for the area that they're in, but if you are just going for one or two it's not too bad. Also, I do believe the Choclate Vanilla Stout is the best beer I have had in a long time and the wings are a pretty good value foodwise."}
{"text":"Comfort food heaven if you're looking for just plain old bar food don't look here. Everything has been kicked up two notches. I can usually tackle one headwich myself but it is definitely enough for two. One bite into one of these and you know why they're famous. Not to mention of course the beer selection. One of my favorite IPA's (the headhunter) is always on tap. And the only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is you don't always get the friendliest service and I've been both in down times and busy. Consistency in service is not there."}
{"text":"I LOVE FATHEAD'S. The BF and I tried to go to Melt at 4 p.m. on a Saturday and there  was a 2 hour wait. Our PLAN B was this place because we loved the original location in Pittsburgh so much. I think we were both secretly hoping that we'd be eating here. Good thing.

The inside is huge. Had about a 15 minute wait for a table of  4 at 5 on a Saturday. Loved the bumbleberry beer I got, it was a bit fruity but not overbearing and had blueberries in it. Mom liked it too. She gets pretty giggly so I knew she was loving it.

BF had some IPA and he liked it. I don't even  know what that stands for so I can't really elaborate. 

We both ordered the same thing we had the last time. He got the Beauty and the Beast and I got a chicken philly sub. They both come with homemade chips that are delicious. We ordered wings as an appetizer and I swear they were the biggest wings I have seen. Out Quaker Steak to shame.

Although huge, he was able to eat the entire sandwich but I'm guessing he was wishing he had leftovers. Step dad had a burger that came with fries and I stole a few (ok quite a few) and they were great. 

Sandwiches with chips are between $7-$12. Not shabby. Our waitress was polite and prompt, but not too friendly. Liked her.

Love this place, I will use it as a back up plan anytime I  am in Cleveland looking for good  eats. Then I will work out triple hard the next day. It is worth it."}
{"text":"I love Fat Head's so, so much.  I avoided coming here for the longest time because based on its proximity to the mall and other chains, I just assumed it was a run of the mill, bro-laden sports bar.  Imagine my surprise when I walked in and found my new favorite beer.  

Here's the thing, Cleveland.  My love for you runs deep.  You know that.  So I hope you can forgive this blasphemy: Fat Head's blows Great Lakes clear out of the water.   Don't get me wrong, I love Great Lakes (I'm drinking a Lake Erie Monster right now), but whenever friends from out of town want good beer, this is where we come. I've had just about all of them, and while I may not care for all styles, I've yet to have one that I'd consider \"bad.\"  Their \"guest beer\" draft selection is always top notch as well.  I've had some beers on tap here that I've never seen on tap anywhere else.  

Same goes for the food.  The Beauty and the Beast is one of my all time favorite sandwiches, and I could eat the fried mushrooms 'til I pass out.  Considering the portion size (they're called \"headwiches\" for a reason) and that one sandwich turns into multiple meals, the prices are very reasonable.  I've brought friends, family and co-workers here, and everyone's loved it so far.   I also like that there are only 3 locations, so you're not handing money over to a giant chain.  

As much as I sound like a rabid fan, I'll admit it's not perfect.  Like others have said, you can't swap out the sides.  At all.  Not just chips-for-fries or vice versa.  There's no swapping out for a side salad or broccoli here either.  That can be a deal breaker for some, and I totally get that.  It's a very, very odd policy (even the wait staff say it's dumb and can't tell you why the policy is there), but the chips are good, so I'm personally willing to overlook it.  You're also in a restaurant named \"Fat Heads\", so don't complain if you find the food greasy or heavy.  Again: Fat. Heads.  Not \"Health Heads.\"  With that being said, I've never found the food overly greasy.  

Bottom line: best beer in NE Ohio and delicious, bad-for-you food.  Can't be beat."}
{"text":"I had the best service I've ever had here tn. Andrew was my server and he felt very personable and endearing. Everything was perfect. Please promote this guy he goes above and beyond for his customers!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food and beer. I recommend the beer sampler, and the French onion soup. The sandwiches and wings are delicious. Just beware: they have a very strange potato policy about not allowing substitutions. That's ok, though, because their house made chips are AMAZING. Also, my favorite waitress is a woman named Shelby. I highly recommend you request her for the absolute best service you can ask for. A+"}
{"text":"The sandwich selection here is amazing and we ultimately settled on the Mo Betta Beef and Chedda and the Fun Guy Burger. The beef and cheddar was delicious! The Fun Guy Burger was overcooked, dry, and not enough toppings and burger to go with the bun. We tried the smoked wings and felt that although the flavor was great,  they were extremely overpriced ($7 for 3).  My biggest complaint is the \"potato rule\" (see photo). I'm dumbfounded that a $14 sandwich includes \"free\" homemade chips with no choice to swap for fries or (for a non potato eater like myself) to swap for a salad.  If the potato is actually \"free\" then $14 for a sandwich is overpriced.  With all the other wonderful restaurant choices I'll stick to places that are willing to be  more flexible with  specific dietary needs/requests."}
{"text":"Fatheads has a great selection of beer and beverages that are brewed in-house! The BLueberry Honey beer is so good, and they even put little blueberries in it. The food is amazing, the burgers and sandwiches are HUGE. I managed to eat half a burger (which was as big as my face), and the whole plate of fries. I couldn't resist!"}
{"text":"Fathead's Brewery is probably the best micro brewery in the Cleveland area and very well in all of Ohio. Their selection in house brewed beers is normally around ten to twelve draft beers. Then there are about 20 more guest beers. All craft and all draft. Except for miller light, which gets a diminutive tap handle and a hilarious description in their ever changing beer list. Seriously, the list changes almost every day. In only seven months of existence, they have entered three beer competitions and walked away with three medals - two of them being golds.

The food is just as excellent as the beer. Huge portions no matter what you get. Definitely try any of the Headwhiches or Smokehouse wings."}
{"text":"have been here many times.  there  are some must haves.  
smoked wings.  fries   onion rings.   
stay away from the ribs.   
everytbings else is very good.  clean. bathrooms nice. parking a little tight.   beer choices are awesome.  all in all the best place on the west side."}
{"text":"Typical of what you expect bar/brew pub food to be. It is very good burgers, a huge menu, lots of different beers to try, and huge portion sizes.

Be aware this place is busy, had to wait about 1 1/2 hour for a table. It is also extremely LOUD. You can not hear the person next to you if they are not shouting in your ear. I would recommend, just be aware no reservations taken, long wait and again very loud."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Amazing food, beer and atmosphere. Great place to watch a game. The only thing is the wait can get pretty lengthy on the weekends, I've waited up to 90 mins for a table there before. But I assure you it's worth the wait! Bumbleberry is my favorite of their year-round beers, but their seasonal beers never disappoint! Holly Jolly and Spooky Tooth are must haves during the fall and winter. I look forward to the one opening up in Middleburg Heights! Looks like it's going to be huge!"}
{"text":"LOVE the beer and cheese soup here, love the beer, the sandwiches are great...but the fries or chips (depending on whether you get a burger or a sandwich) aren't so fantastic. The chips are almost always overdone and undersalted -- no thank you. One of these days I'm going to learn my lesson and just order two of the four-onion + cheese soups for dinner instead of having a sandwich! The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's ALWAYS miserably crowded, and often tough to get a table."}
{"text":"I love the food at Fathead's, and the Bumbleberry is a great beer for a gal who doesn't typically enjoy them! Their smoky BBQ ribs are the best ribs in town, and I frequently order the Taco salad to go. The main downside to this place is that it is always PACKED and is so hard to get into nowadays. I live right down the road, but don't go much anymore because of frequently running into couple hour+ wait times."}
{"text":"Fat kids rejoice! Your Mecca is in North Olmsted!

First, I love Fat Heads beer.  So why wouldn't I like the place that has the most Fat Heads beer available?  This place has plenty of the namesake beer in so many varieties that it makes me sad my body harms itself whenever it sees a molecule gluten.  But, when I feel like making really bad dietary choices and I want to risk feeling like hell in a few hours after... I head here.

But the awesome doesn't just end with the beer.  The food is huge and plentiful.  The menu is actually too big.  There's just way too much that sounds great.  For crying out loud, the menu reads like the perfect choice of seasoning for a sandwich is essentially stuffing it with another sandwich.    I normally find that places with these huge menus of fat-kid-food don't really deliver.  The food at such places is usually bland, of poor quality, and smothered in sugary sauces to cover up the crappiness of the edibles.  That's not the case at Fat Heads!  This is the place to go to break your diet.  Don't feel bad, just unbutton your pants and get to it.  You can cry about it in the morning, but it will be totally worth the harm to your circulatory system.

And with great beers and food comes great service.  I always have fun servers who seem to actually enjoy the job.  Not the forced fun you get with a server at Friday's or Applebee's.  No, these are people who like the customers and the job.  It shows in how well they treat everyone, how accurate the checks are (even when split crazy ways), and how eager they are to make sure everything is up to snuff.  These folks have quality of service down!"}
{"text":"Food is still awesome! Went here on a Friday and got their special, the fish and chips..very good especially with my IPA....Long wait, but with the beer it didn't see that long ;)
I love all the different choices of beer, they are all really good, and I still recommend the sampler!"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich and burger joint. They have excellent salads as well. While I don't drink beer, the beer selection is amazing. Great casual eating in a pleasant atmosphere with good service.  It is enormous, so even when it is busy, you don't feel crowded in."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer connoisseur but for what its worth I love the Bumble berry beer.  The bar is a fun place to hang with friends.  The food portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Let me start with a confession: I can't stand beer. 

It's an awful thing, I know. Particularly since my entire family are beer snobs. But as hard as I've tried, I simply can't stand the stuff.

So the fact that I really like Fat Heads has nothing to do with the brew. Except on the word of my family, who all say the beer is GREAT.

For me, Fat Heads is a comfort-food winner. Great sandwiches, great salads, and if you are in an artery-hardening mood you cannot beat their fried mushrooms or their onion rings. 

The building is HUGE, with a comfy, barnlike atmosphere. The bar is a great place to watch a game, and the restaurant area is filled with cozy booths. If you are looking for hearty sandwiches, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I came for the fatter version of Peter Griffin's head and stayed for the great beer lineup.

Sitting a the bar during happy hours and/or a baseball game is nearly mission impossible."}
{"text":"BEST reuben! 
The portions are HUGE. My friend had the taco salad and had leftovers for a solid 2.5 days.
Awesome panini's and cool atmosphere. 
You seriously cant go wrong with anything on the menu.
A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Huge portions! You certainly get more than you pay for; I always have leftovers! The menu here is delicious and I have yet to order something I don't like. The beer selections are equally great (the Bumbleberry is outstanding). 

There is certainly ample seating...the place is huge inside, with most seats having views of the large screen tv's to watch games. I have to say I am slightly disappointed by the patio, as it feels like a slightly neglected space. They could have put some touches like lighting and decor out there and some sturdier tables (with umbrellas), but I guess they spent the bulk of the money decorating the inside. 

Overall, a great place for dinner and drinks with friends...certainly a better place to go with a group of people, as it's not really a \"date night\" type of place."}
{"text":"Best Smoked wings by far I have ever had in my life ... 
Great selection of beer ...
Bumble beery beer is great .. 
The burgers are humongous size ..."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had here! This was our first time at this location, but we have been to the brewery, and the Pittsburgh location before. This was by far our favorite!

Don't be worried if the parking lot looks crazy... This place is HUGE! We almost didn't go in because the lot was so packed, but there were plenty of tables to spare! There was a massive bar, and they also have a variety of games, such as darts, and table bowling. It was a louder environment, but not so loud that you couldn't enjoying talking with those at your table.

Our waiter was great! He was helpful and attentive, but he didn't rush us at all.

They have a wide variety of their beers on tap, and on this trip my husband was able to enjoy the Hop Juju. It is one of his favorites! They also had some summer, and fall beers on tap. They have growlers to go!

We got the spinach and artichoke dip, which was probably the best either of us have ever had! This smokey version came with large chunks of artichoke hearts, lots of cheesy goodness, and chicken. It was served with toasted pitas sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Do yourself a favor, and order this! For a main course, I got the teddy burger, which was a BBQ burger with onion rings, cheese, bacon, pickles, horseradish, and BBQ sauce. While it was good, it was just too much for me. It was HUGE, and while all the flavors were good, they tended to compete with each other in my opinion. I would get it again, but just take out some of the components.

We brought our daughter with us, and they had a decent, and reasonably priced kids meals and drinks. Our daughter is little and learning to feed herself, and no one batted an eye at the mess she made while doing so. Many of the friendly staff stopped by to say hi to her."}
{"text":"Great beer, Great food, and Great service! We visited Cleveland for a hockey tournament and ate at Fat Heads on Saturday! Loved it so much we went again on our way out of town!"}
{"text":"Fat Heads is always crowded for dinner.  I've learned this after three attempts to go there and decline a hour or more wait time.  OK, it's a extremely popular place, I get that now.  Finally, I smartened up and visited in the early afternoon.  2pm in the afternoon - Boom!  Immediately seated! 

The menu is massive and we realized it was going to be awhile before we decided what we wanted to eat so we started off our early dinner with a basket of Shrooms. They're coated in a beer batter, fried, then served with a horseradish sauce.  The basket could barely contain the massive amount of mushrooms.  I suggested they upgrade to a bucket.  Anyways, there was probably enough to feed six for a appetizer.

We both ordered 'Headwiches' (You know, sandwiches that are relatively close to the size of your head).  She ordered the Devine Swine, and I got the Fat Italian.  When they arrived they had two very large wooden skewers holding the ginormous sandwiches together.  The chef, taking extra care, stabbed each sandwich with a knife just to be sure they had a safe trip to the table.  My wife agreed to cut our sandwiches in half and go 'halvsies' so we both got to try each - I think that's why I love her.  Her Devine Swine had some of the best pulled pork I've ever had and my Fat Italian was like no other Italian sandwich I've had. On it was your typical Italian sandwich items PLUS crumbled hot sausage and hard-boiled egg.  Amazing!  They have a sandwich called 'Southside Slopes' that I'll be trying next time as it was given the honor of being the the #5 best sandwich in America according to Maxim Magazine.

Lets not leave out the fact that Fat Heads is also an award-winning brewery with several different handcrafted beers brewed on-site for you to enjoy.  So wonderful, they will soon be opening up a standalone brewery in Middleburg Heights to increase production and distribution.  Woo-Hoo!

My tips: Go early, with a hungry tummy, and check out the menu before you visit!"}
{"text":"The place is terribly good. Terribly - because you are eating pure and drinking pure lard - cheeseburgers and beer. Good - because damn, its sooo good. 
Service was good, they accommodate large groups easily , staff is pleasant. 
I loved the name of the sandwiches,  so freakishly honest : \" triple bypass\" will guarantee you exactly what it says if you eat it more than once in your lifetime.
So if  your New Year's resolution was not to star in the \"Nutcracker\" next  holiday season (like mine), please check this place out and also say\" hi\" to my liver. I think I left it there in the third booth by the window after the last hefty dinner I had there."}
{"text":"Beer is excellent, food was just ok. I really like their beer, so I go for that and just get a burger. Always crowded."}
{"text":"i am a huge craft beer girl, so the beer selection here gets an A+! i love the bumbleberry. nice add with the fresh blueberries floating in the drink. 
food. ahhh. i am ALL about huge portions and lot of choices. i love having a hard time making a meal decision. menu is huge. the portions are equally huge. 
nachos. one word: AH-MAZING. absolutely amazing. seriously. did i mention how yummy they were? fresh cut chips.....so not your ordinary nacho presentation, but man. i wanted to lick the plate. again. very large so we easily split between four of us. 
i can honestly say, i have never been disappointed. good food=good beer. what more can a girl ask for?! 
watching your diet? uh, probabaly not the best place to go. cheat day? then head on out. order yourself a bumbleberry. :)"}
{"text":"They have some good home brews and some not so good, but they carry other micro and macrobrews too. The smoke house wings are amazing, but the regular wings always taste frozen and mushy. Other food portions are gigantic, and decent tasting... I didn't try the burger yet, but the pizza is good. Don't let the constantly packed parking lot fool you, the place is huge and the wait isn't too long."}
{"text":"Good HUGE WHOLE wings! Half off Monday nights! Great garlic fries and awesome ranch!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. I had the Parma Sutra which is a burger topped with pierogies and onions with a side of horseradish sauce. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. And filling. Extremely filling. Washed down with a couple of Fat Head Brews and there is nothing more satisfying. They even have a good guest draft list - I ordered a Kasteel Rouge from a brewery in Belgium and it was delicious.

Would not come here if on a diet or looking for a light meal. Even their vegetarian options are enormous."}
{"text":"nice place to go for a burger. really crowded tho. nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love this place. We usually sit at the bar and we love the atmosphere. The beer is always good, the bartenders are usually pretty attentive (obviously depending on business), and the food is to die for. Literally. We only go on cheat days because we load. up. Haha. If you've never been, I don't know what you're doing with your life, but go. Eat. Drink. Eat some more (seriously, those fries)."}
{"text":"Headed in for pre-airport lunch and socializing. This place is huge! They probably seat close to 300! Definitely good for a crowd. 

I tried the bumbleberry brew due to a clevelander's recommendation. Fresh Blueberries floated in my ice cold beer. Delicious. 

Me and hubs shared wings, fried perrogies, and a smoked prime rib dip. The portions are ginormous! The fried perrogies were awesome! They were crispy on the outside with fluffy potato cheese filling. Served with sour cream. The prime rib dip was huge! It was good on it's own but the au jus was a cup of liquid salt. It destroyed your palette with a burning salty sensation. It was served with crispy housemade chips  The wings (regular buffalo) were cooked fine but had a strange sweetness we didn't like. 


My sister had a Burger. Can't remember the title but it had bacon, cheese, and a fried perrogie on top. How can you argue with that?! Really really good burger. 

My mom was pleased with her \"brewben,\" a Reuben twist. Guess it had a spicy pepper kick. 

All in all, a great spot for casual family friendly lunch and good beer."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings around- you have to get the smokehouse ones, they're so much better than the regular wings. The beastly BBQ is our favorite - spicy and delicious. 
Our favorite sandwich is the Southside Slopes that has kielbasa and perogies on it...it's a must try. 
We also recommend the breaded mushroom appetizer - it comes piled high in a basket and is enough to share with a group of people. It comes with a horseradish dipping sauce which is also tasty.
The service has always been pretty good.
Now, the beer. We are ALWAYS happy with their beer!! They have many different styles to choose from....we love them all, especially their IPAs. You can also do flights to sample them all! 
The parking isn't plentiful, I wish they had a bigger parking space. Also, there's a ton of windows in the restaurant and it's pretty cold during the winter to sit in a booth next to the windows."}
{"text":"Fourth time I came in to get calamari Togo with let me say pretty subpar customer service from your hostess slash Togo especially when it comes to knowledge of menu items especially an appetizer  like calamari I have been charged for and asked for extra sauce haven't received it once. I have asked for extra cheese every time stating the cheese that comes with it twice I got a side of nacho cheese then once I got it without cheese and the last time I had to clearly tell her the bleu cheese that comes on the dish because she didn't understand. The thing beyond all of this that brought me to complain was the METAL PIECE OF A BROKEN FRYER BASKET in the calamari. I work in the industry I rarely complain but I think this is a opportunity in which you guys can fix system break downs. Thanks and I look forward to getting more calamari when I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The beer is awesome!! I can't say the same for the food... So I'm giving it a 3 star. The food was OK. Nothing great. I've eaten much better at different restaurants. Love the beer tho!! I would still recommend giving the place a try, just thinking I may eat a salad or something next time. Keep it cheap... Spend more of my money on the beer :)"}
{"text":"We had lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a huge group and had great service. This place is huge and great for both big and small groups, the young and the old. The food is really good with enormous portions....enough for 2-for sure. Don't skip on the wings. They are some of the biggest- and best- I've had. We ordered the sauces on the side so we could get the true smoked flavor; the wings don't' need any sauce but it's hard not to use them because they are soo tasty! The pretzels (with amazing mustard horseradish sauce) were so good, we had to get a second order. And the ginormous pulled pork sandwich was definitely a win for me, along with the homemade chips and fries. Oh- and how could I forget the homemade root beer. Yes, homemade! They brew it there and it's so satisfying to end the meal with. Wish this place wasn't so far away so we could go more often!"}
{"text":"An hour and a half wait for an out of towner, that beer better have been touched by jesus... 

They should open up a second location because this brewery was as packed as a school dance. We ended up going next door."}
{"text":"I'm a brewpub lover so, when I randomly drove by this place on my first night in Cleveland, I decided to try it, even though I had other stuff to do.
This place is very large, apparently inside of an old market. You're greeted by the brewing facilities behind glass and a very long bar, which leads to the table seating in a raised area.
I sat at the bar and was quickly greeted and gave my requisite shpiel: water, your food menu and do you do a tasting a tray? They had eight of their own beers on tap, and that's what came in the tray. I think it ran about $9.50, which is good relative to other brewpubs.
While he poured, I looked over and saw their guest taps. Wow! It's like a who's who of regional micros and, not being regional, I had never tried the majority of them. They also had an Avalanche and a Stone (a very good Stone) on tap, which was a total surprise. Altogether, the guest taps numbered at least 15, putting the total at about 25. But wait, there's more: They had two more cask taps, featuring two more guest micros. Wow, again!
When the bartender returned (he poured quickly), I got the skinny on the place. Fat Head's is a relatively famous Pittsburgh restaurant on that city's south side. Strangely enough, I had walked by the place the previous night but didn't go in because it was packed (this was during a Penguins' Eastern Conference playoff game). That location and this were their only two though, and this was the only one that brewed beer.
The food menu yielded a plethora of fabulousness. Something that says \"brewpub\" to me is a reuben, and they had two, including what I can only call \"a reuben on steroids\" called the \"brewben\" (cute).
A lot of the menu was Pittsburgh-related, with lots of sausage, a couple of perogi dishes, and lots of burgers and pizza. It was really quite extensive, but all looked really good.
But they also had a definite Cleveland twist on things. For instance, the \"brewben\" (which I ordered because it looked too damn good) came with Cleveland's famous Stadium mustard and hot peppers. Sounded weird, but, I have to say that it was one of the best reubens I've ever had. None of the various ingredients were overwhelming, the meat was nice, and the bread was just awesome. The sandwich was served with a side of \"fries,\" which were actually thick, lightly fried potato pieces (chips, essentially). This all ran about $9, and I had about half a sandwich to take home (a lot of food).
Per the beer, I can't say that it's the greatest I've ever had. I did like a few. The lager was really nice (even though I don't usually like lagers) and the heff was smooth and very drinkable (even though I don't usually like heffs, although this was definitely filtered).
The bartender was really, really nice and quick, my food came out very quickly (5-10 minutes after the order was placed) and it's kind of a fun place. Weird location, but I couldn't help but share the bartender's enthusiasm, as he optimistically discussed potential plans to extend to Columbus and ship the beer brewed there down to their Pittsburgh location."}
{"text":"Ridiculous sized portions and great comfort food! Beer is good and ice cold. I would eat here more often if the calorie count wasn't obscene and the beer so dang good! Alas, I must watch my figure and reserve this place only after fasting for 3 days."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have built a solid feeling for the place. The food portions are HUGE, and is generally really tasty! Wait staff is hit or miss. We've had both very friendly staff and the absolute worst staff you could imagine. 
Being a beer snob, I have to say their beers are fantastic! They have a very wide variety of styles to suit all drinkers. 
One negative is they can be VERY expensive! Both beers and food seems to be overpriced in my eyes."}
{"text":"Cool place, very popular - at least on the weekends - so be ready to wait a bit if you're heading there.  Tons of beer and the menu is just huge.  We had the onion rings which were fried in a darker beer batter.  They were good but nothing too special taste-wise.  We also tried the wings which were good but a lot of work because they weren't seperated into flat/drummie.  Didn't think it was worth the work to consume those, but they did taste good.  The buffalo chicken pizza was very good and I would get that again.  Good food and a good atmosphere.  If there's one thing to remember about this place it's that portions are HUGE.  Go there hungry."}
{"text":"The service here top notch!!  The food portions are overwhelming.  I made a decision to try not to always order the same thing.  It is tempting to stick with the tried and true but have been working diligently to expand the horizons.  This last time I had the Fat Italian, served hot.  OMG!  and now I have a new favorite.  Frankly, there has only been one sandwich that I had that didn't hit the five star mark and that was the steak sandwich.  Everything else and I mean everything, is very good.  

There is also a huge variety of items.  Hamburgers, wings, soups.  Get the nachos which are made with potatoes.  Not only are they awesome BUT because they are made with potatoes, you can reheat the leftovers.  

We love bringing friends here.  The food is good and if they want to try different beers, you can't beat Fat Heads!"}
{"text":"Like the consensus says...great beer and good food!  Always packed but for a good reason.

Enjoy sitting outside in the summer and their patio, just a solid experience all around.

Portions are fantastic and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Large and loud dining room. Booths are all wood and quite uncomfortable. Some tvs but not as many as I expected in such a large place. 

Surly waiter. He was good at taking clues as to when we needed refills and were ready to order. 

Highest priced wings ever- and they're not any better than the ones I've had elsewhere. Average sandwiches and super-gready chips that you are not allowed to substitute under penalty of death."}
{"text":"Five stars for beer, two stars for everything else.

----

Let's cut to the chase: the reason to come to Fat Heads is the beer list--they have a nice combination of their own brews and other local craft beers on tap. Their Head Hunter IPA is particularly worthy of trying, but all the Fat Heads beers are good.

I'm not sure what the people who think Fat Heads has great burgers are thinking: in my experience, they are average at best. Tremont Tap House, Nano Brew, Hodge's, B Spot, and TownHall all have far better burgers as well as beer that's every bit as good as Fat Heads. On one visit, I was also served a pathetically wilted salad, which there is just no excuse for.

Service is average. For being a brewery, many of the servers seem to know astoundingly little about beer. That said, food and drinks were delivered promptly and as ordered.

One of my main complaints about Fat Heads is the space. It's huge, and not in a good way. It's awkwardly laid out, there are TVs but you're likely to find yourself sitting in a corner where you can't see one, and some of the park-bench style seats are neither comfortable nor interestingly designed. Before Fat Heads moved in, this place was a grocery store/farmers' market hybrid, and it shows; the atmosphere just can't compete with other brewpubs in Cleveland.

Worth it if you're in the area, at least for the beer, but definitely not worth venturing out to suburbia for on its own accord."}
{"text":"Fatheads is one of the best breweries in Ohio. Great atmosphere! Very large establishment equipped with a wrap around patio, full bar, and tons of seating. My boyfriend and I went for dinner and it was stellar. We ordered hot wings as an appetizer - they were finger licking good. We also ordered a beer flight which consisted of an array of beers (i.e. Ipas, lagers, etc.). Our entrees consisted of a bacon cheeseburger and the triple bypass. The burger was SOO good and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was Angel he was very attentive with a great personality. All in all a great experience and I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Portions are so huge that ordering any sandwich feels like a waste of food, but everything is bar food at its finest. Their smokehouse wings tho.... Best wings I've ever had. Worth going out of my way for those wings"}
{"text":"I had a chicken club sandwich that was amazing. My husband got some monstrous burger that he loved. We live out of town but will definitely come back when we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"The menu had many interesting bar food items to pick from.  We had wings, sandwiches, and the calamari that were all good.  We asked the server to bring us their highest rated house brew and were served the Head Hunter IPA.  Do not, I repeat do not try this stuff unless you really like eating pine scented air fresheners.  It was almost undrinkable.  I know it has won awards and many people rave about it, but unless you have some idea what you are dealing with, stay clear.  
The atmosphere was very good and the place was packed.  Just don't venture into the exotic beer selection without serious guidance."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Great food and beer selection. We have never gotten a bad plate of food here and have tried multiple dishes. The atmosphere is very unique too, but I would like to see the dinning area a bit cleaner. The carper seems old and very worn and they get so busy that sometimes the cleaning isn't a priority."}
{"text":"First off this place is huge. They have so many draft beer options and food options. It was so busy on the Saturday night I went here, because there was an Ohio State football Game on. So the locals know that this is the place to be to watch a game. Huge Portions of really tasty food! I ordered a few apps and a burger which were all great. We sat at the bar to eat (Something my wife and I love to do anyways) because the wait was quite long. I am so blown away by how good this place is. I've been a fan of Headhunter IPA for a long time, and I was upset that I never knew this place existed until recently. I'm an Eastsider, and this was so worth the drive."}
{"text":"However much you think you need to order, food-wise, order half that much, and MAYBE you'll be able to finish it all.

You know when you go to Olive Garden, and they bring that huge bowl of salad for the whole table to share?  Okay, now imagine that just being your salad, except it's 12 times better, and that's about my experience at Fatheads.  My wife's grilled cheese was the same story again.

The beer selection seemed pretty impressive compared to a lot of brewpubs I've been to, but I'm not a big beer drinker, so I can't really compare the quality.  Although I did get a couple of samples, and they were super tasty. 

I'm not a big fan of the \"text you when your table is ready\" system.  I don't get the advantage over just using the pagers, especially when my phone doesn't really have a great signal in the bar area, but it's not a huge deal.

I'm glad we found the place.  The food was fantastic and obviously more than enough to feed a small town, our server was super-friendly, and the price was great :)"}
{"text":"Hell yeah, this is a great place. Hungover on a Sunday morning, kinda the last thing on my mind was a burger, but friends suggested this place and I'm not a big enough dick to outright veto a pal's suggestion. I am glad I went along with the crowd, because the food, beer, and service at this restaurant/brewery was fantastic. The \"Triple Bypass Burger\" cured all my ills and then some, complete with an egg on top, which basically made it a breakfast dish. So many places craft great burgers but use shitty buns, but here they used a nice and dense ciabatta bun that left zero of my fingers soaked in burger/cheese/sauce ooze. They will also let you sample up to four of their beers if you're indecisive about their selection (there were almost two dozen Fat Head's own brews on their beer list). All in all, a great place for bar grub to which I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visited Fat Heads one evening for a beer tasting...

My flight of beers consisted of the following beers/ales:

Starlight Lager (5.0% ABV)
Head Hunter IPA (7.5% ABV)
Sunshine Daydream Session IPA (4.9% ABV)
Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale (5.3% ABV)
Alpenglow Weizenbock (7.5% ABV)
Autumn Fire Smoked Lager (5.5% ABV)
Trail Head Pale Ale (6.3% ABV)

All were interesting brews, my favorites were the Head Hunter IPA, Trail Head Pale Ale, and the Autumn Fire Smoked Lager. The Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale was well done for what it is - and was served with a whole blueberry floating in the beer.

I also ordered a plate of Nachos. What I did not notice when I ordered the Nachos was that they are a plate of their potato chips - NOT Tortilla chips, slathered in a cheese sauce which tastes like it came out of a can/jar. I'm not a fan of Nachos made from Potato nor the kind of cheese sauce they used. Not very good.

The place was packed on a weekday night. Service was good, albiet a bit slow at times due to the fact that they were massively slammed the entire time. But they were friendly and got to you as quickly as they could."}
{"text":"So the only reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the smoked wings. They really are fantastic and not your average wing. The beer selection is very good as well but the wine is something to be desired. I get that this is a brewery though so I can forgive the wine. We tried a grilled cheese that had goat cheese on it, not the worst but absolutely not the best. We also tried some regular wings and they were sub par. I had the sandwich called the 'bob and martha' and it was over cooked. The pastrami was better than the corned beef (which you had to pull just to take a bite) and the peppers were a good touch. It was so dry though that I couldn't even eat half of it. 

So if you do go here do yourself a favor and get a beer, some homemade chips with sauce, and the smoked wings. Put the sauce that comes with the chips on everything. It has a pretty big kick so watch out but I could eat it off my shoe it was so good."}
{"text":"New servers suck and they will overcharge you for beers even if you didn't even drink em... stay classy!"}
{"text":"Great beer.Matt Cole has matured into a great craftsmen.
Food is pretty good overall.
Smokehouse wings are the best in C-town.
The Brewben is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
The root beer floats are an old timey treat for desert.
Giant portions,be warned."}
{"text":"I love Fat Heads beers! Bumbleberry is my favorite beer because it is so refreshing. It isn't too sweet so it appeals to an audience who likes a good light beer. 

The service is hit or miss. I have had good service there but more times than not, the service has been slow. 

As for the food, it's okay. I would like to see smaller and healthier options. The sandwiches are unbelievably large and it is almost impossible to eat in one sitting. And I am really not a fan of their chips so I don't like how you can't switch out the side. I know a lot of people love their chips but I am not one of them!"}
{"text":"Had a few hours after a conference so decided to stop by this place on the way back to the airport.  Did not disappoint. 

Large menu featured many different sandwiches and pizzas.  One of the more unique items was the smoked chicken wings.  Menu described it as smoked whole chicken wings grilled then sauced, and lightly pink because of the smoking.  Tempted, but then I was more tempted by their \"Parma Karma\", which was a sausage sampler of Kielbasa, Brats, and Bangers grilled with grilled onions and perogis.  Pretty dang good although I admit I am not an expert in these types of foods.  

Large beer list on type, and many types of other brews including an impressive selection of west coast IPAs such as Bear Republic Racer 5 and Green Flash.  I had their Headhunter IPA and Pack a Wallop SPA, both were excellent.  The SPA (an american pale ale) was hoppy enough (more than regular american pale ales like a firestone pale ale or sierra nevada) with excellent malt tones.  Bitter aftertaste reminds you of the hops.  66 IBUs if you're into that sort of thing.  The IPA featured some pretty piney hops, with some sweet undertones.  The best feature of their IPA and SPA is probably their drinkability.  I can go all day drinking these without feeling bloated.  Very light bodied and flavorful.  

I also had a guest IPA by Buckeye called the 76 IPA, I guess because it's 76 IBUs.  I didn't enjoy this one as much because the hops was too bare without any other sort of flavoring.  Not much sweetness or malt at all.  

Apparantly this place only started brewing about 7 months ago.  I think this one will go far.  Compares favorably with Victory IPAs, in the same region."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a night out to get drinks this is your place. The bar area was quite large and I would have preferred to eat in a booth away from the noisy bar since I don't drink. The portions were massive! They definitely mean FAT head. I had the Turkey Spinach and Mushroom melt on rye bread. I loved that the turkey was carved turkey and not a slab of deli meat. It tasted very good, but it was a  little greasy. Not a healthy choice."}
{"text":"Good craft beer,especially IPA's. I like the Oompa Loompa,and a handful of others. Food is very good,big ass portions lol"}
{"text":"Wonderful house beer selection; as well as beers from other breweries. Onion rings with killer ranch are SPICY and delicious. Hot pretzel sticks with dijon are great. We've eaten almost all of the different sandwiches and they are all fantastic! Favorites are Southside Slopes, any of the ones with pulled pork, Bob & Martha and the Goonie Bird."}
{"text":"Great local brewery in an area where there aren't many unique options. You definitely get what you pay for and \"headwhiches\" literally are the size of your head. Their patio is dog friendly and brewed beers are pretty good especially infamous Bumbleberry."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly cheesesteak because the server said it was one of their more famous dishes and it was less-than-inspiring."}
{"text":"First time vising with our friends and honestly they served me one of the best burgers I've ever had! Portions were huge! Prices were reasonable. Staff was friendly. Our one hour wait turned into a 2 1/2 hour wait but the hostess never lost her cool and she went above and beyond to get our party seated. If they do a little better with coordinating the front end and seating I'd give them 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, pretty nice facility, good food. Very loud in here though, they need some major sound dampening to cut down the echoing."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here, Fat Heads is basically the only reason to come to North Olmsted. 

As a self proclaimed Head Hunter aficionado I have to give the brewery a glowing review. Head Hunter is their flagship IPA and my all time favorite beer. If you don't like IPAs steer clear from this choice because it lives up to it's tagline of uncivilized and aggressive. Have no worries though! There are tons of beers available on tap if hops and bitterness aren't your thing. They even do collaborations with other breweries throughout the season which I think is such an amazing idea. 

As for the food the portions are massive and it's usually executed near perfection. I finally tried the smokehouse wings (it's the whole wing) and they definitely lived up to all the hype I've heard about them. Fat heads also has one of the best spinach and artichoke dips I've ever had. I could probably get that as my meal and be completely content. I usually get the beauty and the beasty which is a spicy pulled pork sandwich. Recently I got the Bay of Pigs which could have used more sauce for me personally. Again, these things are massive. The only downside is there potato famine fiasco. You can only get fries with burgers and chips with sandwiches. No substitutions. Ugh. 

They do decent sized samples for around $1.50 - $2.00 so I tend to get a collection of samples and a beer or build up a flight. All and all one of my favorite stops that I always know will be decent. 

PS they serve the Bumble Berry with fresh blueberries. I don't love (again I like bitter not sweet) it but I recommend trying it if you're there!"}
{"text":"I think i went to Fatheads like 6 times before i ordered food.  Matt Cole is a beer genius!  Some of his concoctions blow my mind!  And the food is ridiculous.  You can eat 1meal for like 3 days.  Never had a bad sandwich there.  I try something new every time.  Did i mention the beer?"}
{"text":"First time here - stopped in after a flight and glad we did I had a great lunch chicken pesto sandwich and bean me up Scotty beer   the staff was friendly and helpful with our questions as the menu is large !"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place or even heard of it. But I have bought fat heads beers many times. The food is delicious and the beer....... The beer. I got a growler of the triple Belgium, I'll be back next week"}
{"text":"I had a killer chicken sandwich, I can tell you it truly was killer.  I don't think I have ever had a sandwich that was so hot (spicy).  Usually when items say they are hot...they don't even come close to making my mouth and body feel like they are on fire.  This sandwich was ridiculous and I loved it.  The place overall is great, only downside is that it was packed and we had to wait an hour before we got called for our table.  Upside was we just drank and ordered food at the bar.  I definitely would recommend this place, the beer was great and I am not the biggest fan of beer, but really enjoyed my Oompa Loompa Stout."}
{"text":"It is terrible it only takes one person, who is in charge mind you to ruin a otherwise great experience.  The manager on duty was glued into his iPad, completely unaware or concerned about his surroundings. When asked if he could change a tv or two back to the game that was nearly over to opt to put the beginning of the Ohio State game on every single tv, his only response was sorry man, it is a Ohio State thing.  You changed the tv's go multiple stations before.   Lying to your guests, no flexibility?  You could pay a team member 9 dollars an hour to clear tables on a iPad.  Seriously not after the customers satisfaction older gentlemen manager with nose in iPad."}
{"text":"Tried to get into here a couple time (in the evening) but it was always jam packed.  Went on a Friday after lunch.

First off the beer and food was great.  I had the cheesesteak and it was right on the money.  Usually I just like fried pickle chips, but their picked spears were on fleek.  Also the smoked wings were awesome as well.

The beer is. \"Forget about it\" their brew is killer.  No question.

My complaint is the overall vibe of the place.  The staff was not overt friendly or rude.  It was a complete indifferent feel.  Very bland. It's like hey we know we draw a big crowd, so be happy your here.  I love a place that has a warm welcoming feel.  This was not it.  

In this case for me 2 out of 3 was bad."}
{"text":"Providing a rich diversity of microbrews eclipsing even Great Lakes (blasphemy in certain circles, perhaps, but absolutely true) and a menu comprised of nearly every incarnation of pub food imaginable, Fat Head's is a phenomenal experience. The restaurant is enormous with multiple cavernous dining areas. It fills up quickly through, and there are no reservations, so try to get there early. While that ubiquitous, pungent brewery smell pervades the bar area, the dining rooms in the rear of this enormous expanse smell only of the pizza and burgers being  consumed there. The beer list, as mentioned, is encyclopedic. One will encounter, in no particular order: porters, IPAs, coffee stouts, strong ales, golden ales, weizenbocks, etc. ad infinatum. Getting a flight is recommended: they are not only cheap, but lift up in a nifty way for carrying purposes should you move from the bar to a table. Most of the sandwiches (called 'head-wiches' for reasons that are quickly apparent when viewing their enormity) are often meat-centric, but vegetarians would do well to try the pizza, or Danny Boy's Farm Fresh Veggie Sub--a real salad on a bun! Overall, Fat Head's is the epitome of what a microbrewery should be. If you don't believe me, scope out the staggering assortment of globe-trotting fan photos that adorn the wall by the bathroom. This place has a bit of a cult following, and with darn good reason!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal.  We ordered the cheddar bacon fries as an appetizer, and they were enough for four people.  I'm not a fan of the kind of oily \"nacho\" cheese you get from a place that sounds like Smaco Yell, but this melted cheddar was was real deal, and piled on with bacon to boot.  The generosity of this plate made me want to call my mother.

I ordered the dry rub wings, which had a nice level of spice that grew as you ate them.  They could have perhaps had a little more saltiness overall... but let me tell you, I ordered six wings thinking I'd have to order more later and I was so very mistaken.  

These wings are enormous things from albatrosses, with the whole wing-thigh combo.  Check out the picture I posted, I have never ordered wings like this.  Between them and the fries, I took two of six wings home, and I am not a man to leave a wing hanging.

I ordered a root beer growler at the end of my meal, and after I got it home I discovered that it is a surprisingly complex root beer - absolutely worth trying, with a strong hint of vanilla and other flavors.  I find myself sneaking into the fridge to take a swig every time I walk by.

With beers, growler, appetizer and two meals, it was a little expensive, but we got a hell of a lot for the money.

We are moving to this side of town in the next few months, and on the day of our move, we're taking our heavy lifting buddies to Fat Heads."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. This place is always packed. The food is great and the price is ok. I've had the cheese steak which is amazing! Never dry and the bun that it comes on is not dry or hard. So many flavors when you bite into this. I've also had a huge hot dog from here. Totally worth the price for a hot dog this size. Their pizzas are great, sometimes the dough is soggy. The less toppings the better. I've noticed the more toppings the soggier the dough. My favorite burger is the mushroom Swiss burger. So much cheese and mushrooms on this and always cooked perfect. The beer is great here as well. The location of this place could be better. They really need a bigger place with their own lot. There are other businesses here and people forget that they have their own parking and not to park there to go to fatheads. Some of the staff can be really snooty, rolls eyes and sighs when you ask for something. I get it, it's busy and you're tired, but when your patrons can see this, it doesn't help the business. You feel like you're interrupting their day. The food even though it's good, it does take some time to come out because it's always packed, which isn't their fault, but when you pay for food, you expect it to be hot, not warm. I've had to send food back because it's cold."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and friendly. Wish they would take reservations. It's a great place, but not wait 2 hours for a table great...

Updated March 2012- The more I go, the more I like this place. The Cleveland Club is a favorite and the house made chips are great."}
{"text":"Very fun good beers lots of choice on menu. Ver busy but hard working help got us lunch as quick as poss. Cool shirts and stuff for sale"}
{"text":"We love this place! Come hungry! The food is seriously bigger than your head! Plus the rock at making beers"}
{"text":"I've been to Fat Heads Brewery several times over the years on trips back to Cleveland to visit family. The sandwiches are HUGE! When I was a vegetarian who ate seafood, my go to was the Codfather. It is delicious! 

On my most recent visit over the holidays, I was trying to buy a mug club membership for my little brother, who just bought a house nearby. For those of you who are interested, they are highly sought after and are only sold through the brewery once a year in April. Disappointed, we had to console ourselves with a holiday brew. We tried the Zesty Holly Jolly, which is even better than regular Holly Jolly. We liked it so much, we left with a growler to share!

Fat Heads has had much popularity over the years, and they are opening a new location in Middleburg Heights. We will definitely be back next time we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The beer here alone is worth 5 stars.

First, this place is SO packed. Like crazy crowded, I think we were given a 2 hour wait, but since we came for it, we stayed. You can grab a beer while you wait, so it's no big deal.

Fathead's is available, at least Bumbleberry, Head Hunter, and a few others, at a few places around. I've had Bumbleberry on tap here in Florida, but it's better here where they put blueberries in it :D The speciality beers you can only get here are really where to focus. Favorites from the night for me included a smoked Helles and the Goggle Fogger hefeweizen.

Food is great for bar food, and while not the best food I have ever had, it was good and amazingly priced. We thought we got the wrong boil at first. The BBQ pulled pork pizza was too heavy on the crust, but the flavors were great. The loaded fries were good and a perfect pairing for beer. The food alone is good, but the beer is what makes coming here great.

Service was also good _ despite the crowd the staff was still awesomely nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming here for a long time.  They do not take reservations so we attempted to get a seat at the bar on a Friday night and it was successful.  The girl bartender working was extremely rude and wasn't helpful at all.  The moment we sat down she was asking us for a credit card, annoyed that we didn't know they don't serve bottled beer, and was pained over getting us a menu.  They have a lot of beers to choose from but she didn't seem interested in telling us about any of them so we both just got a miller lite draft.  

My friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger and the male bartender said \"a miller lite and a bacon cheese burger...really?\"  How rude!  I ordered the Aloha Chicken sandwich.  It was an OK sandwich but very boring and didn't have much flavor. My friend really enjoyed the burger, but it was the lack of service that left a bad taste in both of our mouths.

When we finished our beers and our food they never asked us if we wanted anything else and we both couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Two huge sandwiches, 3 homemade craft beers, and it all came in around $35...everything was fresh and delicious.  Friendly/caring service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic assortment of beers and the servings are ridiculous. A little loud at times, but all in all it is a fantastic place to eat!"}
{"text":"Visited Fat Heads for the first time on a Saturday night right before Christmas.  We had a mediocre wait, which I expected.  What I didn't expect was that this place is HUGE!  I had no idea how big this place was inside.  

I started out with Christmas Ale from the bar.  I have to say I enjoyed it much more than the offering from the other place in Cleveland.

The boy and I shared an order of fresh baked pretzel sticks that were serves with a Wasabi/beer/mustard that was amazing.  I never would have thought of that combination, but they hit the nail on the head with that one.

I got a huge and tasty perch sandwich with their chips and the boy got the triple by-pass burger with fries.  Both delicious and we got out of there for around $30.

Highly recomend"}
{"text":"I've never seen a sandwich so big!!!  It tasted great as well.  We've been back a couple times and even when they are busy they have great service.  Cool atmosphere.  The next trip will be with a designated driver so I can sample their huge selection of beer."}
{"text":"What can I say but \"WHERE'S THE SERVICE?\" How can you have so many servers running around and still not get any service. I am not sure if it is lack of training, the age of the servers or just their attitude towards their job, but it will sure hurt their business if they don't address the issue. Restaurant owners need to understand that their staff can make them or break them. I know we will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"Yes, this is an offshoot of a Pittsburgh business, but you'll soon get over it if you're a fan of craft beer and fatty food. The menu is huge and covers just about every category of stuff that goes well with beer. The Headwiches are appropriately named, the smoked wings delectable and enormous, and the pizza just right. Sandwiches come with really nice house-made chips. As for the beers, I'm partial to the Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen and the blueberry ale, but I haven't had a bad one yet. My sole complaint about the place is that service has never really been impressive. Last night, I was the last to join my party, and I waited 10 minutes before someone came by for my beer order. I was about to send up flares to get our server's attention. My evening finished with the to-go portion of my order being incorrect. Not a terrific way to inspire loyalty.

So, Fat Head's isn't my first choice for my food and beverage needs due to the lackluster service, but there's a certain group of beer-swilling friends I meet on a regular basis that finds this a convenient meeting place, so I'm willing to keep coming back. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but we'll say that the presence of the bar bowling machine bumps it up to 4."}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich and it was far and away the best I've ever had. The pulled pork was fantastic. Also had the Bourbon Barrel Aged Hippy Sippy Stout, which was great as well. Only issue was that the chips weren't the best. All in all, great food, great beer and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and beer was phenomenal!!! Been raised in Cleveland majority of my life and just found out about this place from a bartender when I went bowling last night... so glad she suggested this place... Their burgers were big and juicy and full of flavor!!! I am so satisfied at the food, beer, and service given to me tonight... would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"So just how does a Pittsburgher who languishes on the sidewalk waiting to get into Fathead's get in quickly?  Go to Fathead's in CLEVELAND!  Fathead's is in Cleveland, you say?!  Yeppers.  Okay, so it doesn't have that gritty, hip vibe that the original has, but I'll gladly sacrifice authenticity for their fabulous food....equally wonderful in Cleveland!  BUT!  Why, oh why isn't the steak salad with fried pepperoni, hot peppers, fries, cheese, etc., etc. on the menu in Ohio?!  It isn't like Clevelanders have an aversion to over-the-top cholesterol any more than Pittsburghers!  Then again, Pittsburgh doesn't have those succulent smoked wings....almost worth going to Fathead's Cleveland for alone!  No matter which one I go to, Fathead's never fails to make me a happy woman.   Oh...and the Hubby fell in love with the inhouse brewed beers as I did the well-spiced Bloody Mary. GREAT atmosphere and surprisingly attentive service. Fun! Go!  Pittsburgh OR Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drink. Place was packed but the staff still brought us everything we needed. Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"only 1 word describes this place............. yuck!
bad food, bad beer, bad service, bad atmosphere..............."}
{"text":"Smoked wings are amazing here. They are huge and full of flavor. All their beer options are great, obviously! Great menu and atmosphere. We enjoyed the patio."}
{"text":"I come to Fat Head's for the beer, and not necessarily the food. It's descent pub food but as a Veg-Head I can't really judge it too much. 
But I LOVE their beers! I definitely prefer IPAs and hoppier beers, and they have so many different ones to try. When I typically go to breweries I might have one or two that I drink and really like, but at my most recent visit there were at least 6+ that were soooo good. 
Other great ones to try are the bumble berry and pumpkin beer. Yum, we are so lucky to have this in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Recently I have given up my normal go-to drink and have switched to Fat Heads Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale, which I found at World Market. This beer turned out to be my new go to and something I search the store for. Upon hearing that there was a Fat Heads restaurant in North Olmsted, I immediately decided to check it out. The service was okay, however the food was awesome, and the beer was better. I ditched the Bumbleberry and went for the Sunshine Daydream, and needless to say I have a new favorite. The walls were lined with detailings of the success that Fat Heads has received, and boy did it live up to that. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Toledo to catch up with friends. We've seen Fat Heads at a Brewfest. It was worth the trip. 

We came for the beer. But the food was excellent. I had the Fat Italian. Much better than your typical Italian sandwich. Might be the addition of egg. Tasty. Large portions. With handmade chips that were very good. 

For beer, we split a flight - 8 samples. Which seemed bigger than fights we've gotten elsewhere. Then we went back for our two favorites: Hippy Sippy Imperial Stout and Spooky Tooth Imperial Pumpkin Ale. Not if available back home. But they are now on our list. Very good. 

Service was good. We will look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting the area and loved it! I wish there was a Fat Head near us in Dayton, it's awesome! The beer selection was first rate, kind of a no brainer here since the place brews its own and serves lots of other fantastic beers, something for everyone. The food is crazy huge and has a flavor to match! I ordered a sandwich that was about as big as an infants head, hence the name I think! My wife and ordered the pretzels with a some sort of mustard that was amazing, the pretzels were the best we've ever had. If you find yourself near a Fat Head, check them out! You may want to fast for 24 hours prior to eating here though, bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"Impressed. 

A single on a crowded Sunday evening. 

Greeted with confidence at door, pleasant people behind the bar, super selection of their own stuff, a menu that can keep you entertained for months. 

Splendid evening. 

Only complaint is that portions are too large. Yes, only complaint."}
{"text":"The beer was great and the food was pretty good too.  It is really loud in there so make sure that you don't want a quiet evening out.  It's a great place to chow down on some really well done bar food and pizza and enjoy beers with family and friends though."}
{"text":"Giant portions, delicious beer. The beauty and the beasty is my go to with some bumbleberry to mellow out the spice with its sweetness. 

Apps: aren't necessary but they are so very good. I live for the breaded mushrooms they are delicious and fresh (they don't travel well so polish them off). The smokehouse wings are very flavorful and come with so many choices of delicious sauce. 

I couldn't tell you a thing about their dessert menu because I'm always taking something home."}
{"text":"Been here weekly on Wednesday nights after my frisbee games with teammates and the service has been stellar. Before our season started, our captain called them to make reservations for 10-15, every Wednesday at 9:00 pm. 

Among my teammates and I, we've ordered nearly 100 entrees, 100-200 beers: ALL of our orders have come out correctly. Separate checks ? No problem, we've had separate checks for each of us all of us every time, and we've billed correctly every time. Our servers (Kim and there's other I'm forgetting) all have been excellent, bringing water refills without asking, remembering orders, they do a great job. Looking back, it's incredible that they haven't erred even once. 

The sandwiches - triple bypass, cheesesteak, as well as others I'm forgetting - were all solid, none of the ingredients tasted canned. You also receive a generous size as well as potato chips which aren't greasy. 

The only related problem was once out of the 6-7 times, we had to wait 20-30 minutes. 

We'll be back here next year and if I'm around this side of town between then, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out now that Holly Jolly is out. Holly Jolly is a Christmas Ale, and one of the best if you ask me. Overall the brewery and saloon were nice. It was a big spacious place, lots of TVs, good beer, and pretty good food. The portions of the food were enormous so if you go to eat, bring your appetite with you. I got to try several beers while I was there. All were good and the variety is such that there is something for everyone. In the end, my favorite was the Holly Jolly though. In summation, I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Shrooms were overrated and flavorless. Sandwiches were a bit greasy and bread was hard."}
{"text":"Hour wait, already knew that going in. Go to the game room where the bowling alley and pool tables are, grab a server and I USUALLY open a tab. They were very busy so I did not get any service. Went to the bar to get my beer, it was crowded at the bar and Kelly the bartender took our order with a terrible attitude, as if she had stock in the business. When a customer asks, this is what he wants. Don't try to change his mind. I don't care about your opinion, I've been here a hundred times, just give me what I want. My wife and I and son ordered four beers. Again, she asked, \"Who are these for?\" I looked at her, \"Us.\" Again, \"Well, wouldn't you like to try the samples?\" No, I've been here a hundred times, I know what I want. We were finally served our beer, paid for them, and went back to the game room because there was nowhere to sit and an hour wait. After five minutes, Kelly came back to the game room and said, \"Who is drinking these beers?\" I looked at her in disbelief. Then she asked four our Id's. Now, I'm a 53 year old man, my wife is 50 and son is 27. I can see her asking my son. Be careful of Kelly, she is very rude. Why didn't she card us at the bar, when she sold us the beer? We each grabbed a beer and I grabbed two. Thank god for Robert the waiter! He really made up for the whole experience and the food was excellent as always. 
Thank you, Robert, for excellent, excellent service! You are one of the best servers I have ever met and I lived in Las Vegas for 15 years and know the service industry. Kelly, leave your problems at home and get a clue how the service industry works, especially as a bartender."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a beer. The list was immense and impressive as were the beers we tried !! The only thing more impressive was the service ! For a busy saturday, our bartender was attentive and fast ! Cant wait to go back !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants and breweries that I've been to. The food is phenomenal and the beer is too. Bumbleberry is the go-to beer. I like that they offer brews from other breweries too. The headwiches and smoked wings are a must, but come with an empty stomach and prepare to take food home. My favorite sandwich is the chicken little; the hogzilla is good too. You can almost never go wrong with anything from their menu."}
{"text":"I've lived in several states in my lifetime, and my visit to Fat Head's was easily one of the WORST restaurant experiences i've ever had!  Where to start?!  Our server was extremely unfriendly and un-enthusiastic from the get-go.  We were missing silverware, and she acted as if I told her someone had died when I asked her to please bring us some!  In addition, I simply did not like the taste of their root beer, and she kept trying to sell me on it's taste and unique-ness, implying that I was crazy!  On that day, they had a salmon sandwich 'special', which was brought to me uncooked and raw in the middle.  When I asked the server to please have it cooked, she was frowning and literally grabbed the plate from me!  I could NOT BELIEVE the attitude that she copped, and I had my sister-in-law and 4 year old child with me to witness her shenanigans!  One would think that the presence of a 4 year old 'supercutie' would have had a positive effect on this lousy server's disposition!  What really 'blew my top' was when I repeatedly asked for the check, and it arrived 20 minutes later!  Clearly, this psycho server was playing infantile mind games with me by this time, so when I finally got the check, I left the bill amount on the table, but did not want to leave a tip.  ANY tip!  I've NEVER done this before in all my 48 years alive (at the time)!  I stormed out of there so visibly upset that I told one of the managers that I will NEVER return, and I meant it.  For me anyway, this place is a JOKE!  What an insult dining there!"}
{"text":"If you love big meaty American sandwiches this is the place to be. I'm not a fan of beer at all but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Fat Heads! I have enjoyed almost everything I've tried here. Only thing that didn't catch my fancy was the wings- the sauces are good but the wings themselves are just okay."}
{"text":"What can I say about Fat Heads that hasn't been said already? It's delicious with an excellent beer selection. They truly take a creative spin on beer flavors and labels. 

The best advice I could give is come hungry! Sandwiches literally as big as your head. Hence the name...

I also recommend the Bumble-berry beer. It's fantastic! Blueberries come standard in every glass and it's so much fun to watch them rise and fall in the beer. I am easily amused if you couldn't tell... 

The reviews are true! Delicious and probably not nutritious, but who cares about that anyways? Not me, that's for sure. Great for groups and just hanging out while drinking exuberant amounts of unique beer. Responsibly of course!

Realistically, any restaurant that puts pierogis on anything is ok in my book!"}
{"text":"Undecided. Every time I come here it's over 1.5 hour wait to have food that is meh. We are going again tonight I hope that it changes my mind otherwise I'll probably never come back.. I'll keep you all updated"}
{"text":"Wish I had tried this place sooner!! Went last night, and we tried #1, imperial head hunter, and the bumbleberry honey blueberry ale. ALL excellent! The food was amazing too. Typical bar food, but done right! Also, surprised that the GM was running food-- seemed like a super nice guy. Only disappointment was, I had noticed something on the beer menu about double chocolate stout cake, and when I asked about dessert, I was told \"we're not known for our desserts.\" So I didn't bother. But I shall return for awesome beers and good food."}
{"text":"If you're a Beer Snob, this place is for you;
With around 30 micro brews on draft you really can't go wrong.  Fatheads own brews are always very interesting the Apenglow Weisenbach has been one of my favorites (Do not let the description of this beer scare you), several of their seasonal brews are also great (Spooky Tooth in particular)

Fatheads, being in a old Farmers Market  and with the brewery on location really add to the experience; The aromas of hops, yeast and so on just hit you when you walk in. 

The food is very heavy, but good.  Those who complain about the heat obviously are not reading the entrees complete description before they order.  Be prepared to take home some leftovers,  in addition to the food being dense the portions are comically huge.  The only thing I haven't really been a fan of is the Pizza, its ok but not great I would not order it again.

The only reason I gave Fatheads 4/5 Stars is because the service is sometimes lacking, I know its probably because the place is packed with an Hour plus wait when I'm usually there (Fri & Sat nights) but sometime its ridiculous.  On several occasions I have had to waive down other servers to get a check, etc.  With that being said I keep on coming back to this place because it is just so much fun."}
{"text":"Good food, good variety!
Family friendly although honestly a little too dark. 
Menu varies slightly from Pittsburgh locations which disappointed my son.
Family Burgers were great, I enjoyed my  taco salad. Portions are large and waitstaff was on point."}
{"text":"And to think I once believed micro breweries needed to be located in gritty urban neighborhoods or gentrified touristy areas to be considered \"serious\".  I was wrong.  North Olmsted is as suburbia as towns come and this brewpub blew away all my expectations of what a micro brewery could be.  Arrived with a party of 10.  We were split up at two neighboring booths but did not impede conversation and the staff did their best to accommodate us.  Just keep this in mind if you are bringing a large party.  This seems to be a popular place for large parties and I don't think they take reservations.

With respect to the food, everything that came to our table was large and awesome.  No one had anything to complain about -- other than fact that maybe appetizers were not necessary after all!!  Waitress recommended a relatively new smoked brisket and cheddar sandwich that was a really nice alternative to a burger.  I had a chance to sample the Southside Slopes and that was a nice surprise as well.  Onion rings and fried mushrooms were nice starters.  Just remember -- the portions at this place are huge!  You will take home enough for next day's lunch.

Not familiar with Fathead beer as they do not distribute to my hometown of Chicago.  I stuck with the Head Hunter IPA and would definitely recommend.

Great food.  Great beer.  Really friendly service.  Incredible value for what you get.  I will definitely come back next time I am in town.  The only suggestion I have is that they enclose the outdoor seating area with a fence or greenery to make it more inviting.  No one wants to sit alongside a busy road."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was pretty good. We split a wedge salad and it was very good. Then we had the philly steak. It was pretty good but they used the liquid cheese which we do not like. We would return but order another sandwich."}
{"text":"Visited on a recent trip home to CLE. The beer was delish. Sandwiches were insanely large, very creative!  Most impressive were the apps. The basket of mushrooms was enormous and the wings are the WHOLE wing. Not the two separates pieces. Needless to say, we over-ordered. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for bar food, beers, and socializing.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of their beer selection.

Beer selection is top notch, not only with their house beers, but their visiting taps are great too.  Recommend the Head Hunter IPA and the Foggy Goggles (if you like a hint of banana in your beer).  The smokehouse wings are phenomenal and their sandwiches are top notch.  Would definitely frequent if I were a local!"}
{"text":"Beer was very solid and the food is fantastic. Smoked wings w buffalo sauce perhaps the best in history. The portions are insane and the name is certainly fitting. This place is Legit."}
{"text":"Fatheads is a decent spot out in the west burbs to go if you are looking for a casual spot to meet up for some food and beers. 

Huge bar area, huge dining area, huge menu, huge portions. Sensing a theme here? 
This place has an almost annoyingly huge menu. It takes you 15 minutes to even look through all of it, another 10 to decide what to order. Pizzas are huge, sandwiches are huge. Definitely enough to share unless you're a yeti. The food that we've had has been pretty good and it's reasonably priced. 

Sometimes the service at the bar can be slow. Getting a seat can take forever. They'll give you a little pager thingy but it seems like a year sometimes when it doesn't seem like there are that many people waiting. It can be really really loud in the bar area too so I wouldn't take anyone who's hard of hearing there on a Saturday night. There a few booths in which the air conditioner will drip all over you in the summer. Look up before you sit down. 

Some of the food is over-spiced. The spicy pulled pork is, as some others have mentioned, SO RIDICULOUSLY hot. Even Sean who generally likes a good forehead sweat and can eat some spicy stuff was not feeling it.

The beer is just ok. Usually there are a couple of their house brews that I like. The scotch ale is nasty and Sean who is a beer snob just isn't that impressed. I however, love the Bumbleberry. Call it girly if you want but don't knock it til you try it. It's not a fruity -tasting beer. Just the slightest hint of blueberry and it's fantastic. 

Overall, this place is decent. It's an easy meetup spot for a lot of my peeps scattered over the west burbs. It's not an awesome spot, but it is A-OK with me."}
{"text":"I found this place hit or miss. The beer is always excelling but the food is just eh most of the time. I would recommend getting the sampler of the beer and to find one item that you really know that you are going to enjoy and stick with it. I've had two food items here before, their Black Bean burger (I'm trying my best to be a vegetarian, or at least eat less meat) and their Triple Bypass burger. The black bean burger is forgettable and it is probably one of the worst \"burger\" I have had in a long time. I know, I should've known this from the get-go that I should get a real burger made from beef but I wanted to give it a shot. The Triple Bypass burger on the other hand was delicious when I had it. Though the burger itself wasn't the best, it was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed it when I ate it."}
{"text":"A big fan of Bumbleberry so thought we'd try the restaurant. Unfortunately we were sorely disappointed. Dirty restaurant, slow service, rude service, flat beer, I could go on. Food was okay which is only reason it gets a second star. I really wanted to like it, but just couldn't do it. Stick to buying the beer via retail."}
{"text":"Awesome all the way around. ..I'm not a craft beer drinker but they had a large selection.  Food was awesome,  great portions and tasted great.  I had the brisket sandwich which was amazing. Bf and mil had the smoked wings which were huge and tasted great.  Ordered the nachos, it was a huge and tasted great.  Wish we lived closer so we could eat here more often"}
{"text":"Fatheads again proved why it's my favorite destination.  Amazing service coupled with oustanding food and beer."}
{"text":"Wish we didn't live 1100 moles away. If you like anchovies order the Great Carmoni. If you are a beer geek you won't be disappointed and should order a flight of all 8 on tap. Be sure to specifically ask for fresh potato chips."}
{"text":"Beers are great and atmosphere is too .... Could do without the consistent long waits, but I guess you'll have that. Beware-portion sizes are huge. My salad was a whole head of lettuce. So come hungry!"}
{"text":"Another stop on our short trip to Cleveland was to Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon.  I actually planned to check this place out before our trip even started. A friend of mine is a frequent visitor of their Pittsburgh location and I've watched their brewery rise to much fame at the Great American Beer Festival the last couple of years.

Fortunately Fat Head's was just a few minutes drive from our hotel in Westlake, Ohio. My parents joined my wife and my son for a nice Friday lunch before a wedding later that evening. We arrived to find the very large restaurant mostly empty, though there was a growing crowd at the bar and a few other tables throughout the spacious dining areas.

I forgot to take pictures of the beers we sampled, but they were all delicious. Their Head Hunter IPA has won back to back medals at the previously mentioned GABF and is wonderful. My dad and I both started with a tall glass of this. Altogether we also sampled the Kolsch, Citra Pale Ale, Up In Smoke Porter, and a few others that I cannot remember. I enjoyed everything that I tasted and wish I could enjoy them more regularly.

As good as the food was, I was really impressed by the food. Not only are the portions gigantic but everything tastes very good as well. I had the Aloha Chicken sandwich with a grilled chicken breast topped with ham, provolone cheese and grilled pineapple. Finished with a splash of Extra Medium Sauce ($8.95). My wife had the Beauty & The Beasty sandwich with pulled pork in Beasty BBQ Sauce. Topped with creamy cole slaw, pickles and raw onions ($10.95). Both were great sandwiches and the accompanying home-made chips were very good too.

We all really enjoyed our lunch here. I definitely want to go back sometime in the future. I just wish it wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"The food is average, but the beer list is amazing.  (Although, I wouldn't recommend their own brews.)  The beer list is the reason that I'm giving it four stars.

Also, the too-cool-for-you bartender is no longer there, which improves the experience."}
{"text":"Husband and I sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks last weekend. Didn't order any food even though I heard it was great! Will definitely be back for dinner at some point. Beer was delicious and the service was impressive! Quick to check on us and even quicker to get us our order. Fan"}
{"text":"Upon entering and sitting down at a table near the bar area, it took awhile for anyone to come over to us.  When someone finally did, they brought chicken fingers....oops, they weren't ours, since we hadn't even seen a menu yet.  Finally, someone came over with menus....but we had just come for drinks, and didn't try any food.

More specifically, we had come for the Bumbleberry Ale, which was a 2010 Midwest winner.....and they were out of it.  I was sad, as it was what I came from out-of-town to try.....  the waitress was unable to tell me when they would have it again.  So, I settled for the Apricot Wheat, which I wasn't too impressed with.  It was a bit malty for my taste.  I sampled and then got a glass of the Summer Haze also, which I did like.  I was going to try another beer (German-like with banana and clove notes), but they were out of that as well.

If the waitstaff were more on the ball and their inventory were more in order, I would have rated this higher....but...maybe better luck next time."}
{"text":"With so many reviews I was excited to check this place out but was a lil disappointed in that it had a chain feel.  The beer was delicious and I got the mushroom Swiss burger.  No complaints and service was friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great beer! Great food! I have been here about 10 times now. My first visit was disappointing and I had no intentions to ever return. My burger was dry and I hated the Mafioso Chips! At least that's what I call them because they don't let you substitute their chips for fries. (WHY DO PLACES INSIST THAT YOU TRY THEIR CHIPS????) So instead u have to order your fries as a side order and the chips are forced on your plate and your wallet whether you want them or not. So that's where the 1 star deduction is! The chips actually are good but I'm just not a chip guy. But whatever, it's where everybody wanted to go another time so I gave it a 2nd chance and I'm glad I did. 

Since my first visit they have been flawless and my second experience made me wanna go back for more. The service has always been pretty good and with the exception of my first experience and the Mafioso Chip racket they run, I haven't had a bad meal. If you like a little spice in your life I highly recommend the Killer Chicken or the Cuyahoga Burger! 

Tip: Get the NoWait app to request a table. It saved us a 2 hour wait on our last visit. This place gets packed on the weekend!"}
{"text":"This place was very busy for the cavs finale game 4. The hostess was great at helping us find a good seat to watch the game. Server was great with helping us find the perfect beers. Just a fun atmosphere with good service"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. Was not a fan the first time at all. Came yesterday and OMG, it was just incredible. Though the menu is a bit overwhelming but the choice I made was AMAZING. Hands down the best Italian \"sub\" ever! Server was just as great as can be. Wish I could recall her name! I will be back no doubts!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Pittsburgh saloon but never the Ohio locations. The space is great and much roomier than I expected. I have always been a fan of their beers, particularly head hunter. Now that j live in NC, it was so nice to drink and feel nostalgia. This was definitely the go to spot for watching the Ohio game which made it very exciting atmosphere even for a non-sport fan. Service was equally great  with very nice servers and bartenders. I have no complaints about my visit and I don't think that's just the beer talking :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite before heading to the airport. Service was great and food was good."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the beer! Fat heads, which started in Pittsburgh has kind of become a Cleveland staple! My favorite beer that they make is the Bumbleberry! They serve it with blueberries.  They also have some really great season beers, with my favorite being the Holly Jolly.  I would compare it to Christmas Ale but better.  (That might offend some people)
As for the food, prepare for large portions.  The sandwiches especially are massive and I usually just do not eat the bread since the bun is just too big.  My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwhich prepared with their Garlic Parm wing sauce. 
The restaurant itself is large and they have a huge bar area.  Be prepared to wait if you come during dinner hours on Friday or Saturday.  I have never had bad customer service here.  One time thy brought me the wrong sandwhich, so they comped my husband and I for our beers.  Really great place and I will be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to fatheads a lot. Enough so that I owe then another review for all of the fun nights out and meals I've had here. For starters, ask my boyfriend what his favorite restaurant of all time is and without even skipping a beat he will tell you Fathead's.  This is mostly because headhunter is his favorite beer and the great bar food/large portion sizes.

They have a beer for every taste here. I always go back to my old faithful, bumble berry. If you're into strong hops and IPA, then reach for a headhunter. If you are into more wheat based beers like myself, try out the bumble berry or the heffeweizen... always a safe choice. Mug club, we're coming for ya!

Service has increasingly gotten better since I wrote my first review a few years back. It's always crowded here so don't expect top notch service but the servers are always friendly and knowledgeable. 

Let's breakdown the highlights of this massive menu so you don't get overwhelmed when trying to decide what to order. Pro tip: Everything you order is going to come in a larger portion than you think! 

Appetizers- The best apps here are the breaded mushrooms with horseradish dipping sauce and the nachos. The nachos use thick cut potato chips and are more than enough to split with 6 people. Sometimes we order these with 6 wings as a meal!  Don't overlook the cheesy bacon fries if you're into eating a delicious pile or greasy cheese smothered fires, but I would pick the nachos or mushrooms first!

Wings- The smokehouse wings here are probably one of my favorite foods. They are seriously so good and filling. You are getting the WHOLE three piece wing here, so a half order is more than enough. Beasty BBQ is my favorite sauce along with the honey mustard and buffalo.

Headwiches- Headwiches are the star here.  They're really only large because the bread they use is massive but don't get my fooled they are still great. The twisted brisket and chicken little are not to be missed. The come with chips, no substitutions.

Burgers- If headwiches are the star, then burgers here are Cinderella. I just recently tried a burger here and will most likely better ordering on every time now! The different combos are creative and they were cooked perfectly. The best part here is that they are the only thing on the menu that comes with their amazing fries. Don't be swayed by the large headwiches, check out a burger.
 
Lastly, they opened up the game area as a place to wait for a table is horrendous (At least on hour on weekend nights). The best part about this is they have servers taking you're drink and app orders while you wait. It is such a great system! To say I like Fat Head's is an understatement, but when we haven't been there in awhile it's also good to know that most major retailers carry their beers when I'm searching for a bumble berry fix! 

Check out their production facility in Middleburg Heights, fun beer tours and limited food menu (they have wings!)!"}
{"text":"We went with a large group and they were able to easily accommodate us. It was very busy but we got great service. Great beer selection and the pizza I got was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the smokehouse wings. They are so delicious. This place gets super packed on weekend nights. The beer selection is unique. Awesome burgers too. You will get full after dining here."}
{"text":"We tried this after using Yelp to find a good lunch spot. We had just gotten off the plane and couldn't quite check in yet at the hotel! Yelp had a good rating so we decided to check it out. It was super close to the hotel. 

We got there early so not many cars. My only complaint is that we passed about a hundred tables and they took us all the way to the back. My mom with a bad knee could have used a closer table. 

The menu is GIGANTIC! Like there is something for everyone! Wings, burgers, wraps, chicken I could go on and on. We both decided to go for the burger. Classic bacon cheeseburger with fries. They specifically say on the menu no substitute so we had to get the fries, other items come with chips. 

The burger was great! Cook perfectly to how we ordered and the fries were crispy just how I like it. By the time we left it was packed with people!! 

I don't like in Ohio but if I did I would definitely check this place out again. They had a outside courtyard where they had an event later that night. If you like beer, they had a lot and good food, this is a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best brewpub I've ever been to. You may have a short wait at dinner, but it's MORE than worth it. Flights of 8 of their top house beers runs about $12 - $13 and the food and service are nothing short of amazing! They even have text-based reservations so you'll have an even shorter wait in line once you arrive. We'll DEFINITELY be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Come for the food and stay for the beer, or is the other way around?! I so love this place and all it's about. My only gripe is the parking situation, which is to say good luck in finding a parking spot on most nights, especially Friday and Saturday. All of the food here is tops, but the beer is the main draw. The smoked wings with dry rub are some of the best in town. But the beer....oh my God, the beer. Fat Heads is at the top of the pecking order for local craft breweries in Cleveland, if not the entire US. No matter what style your heart desires, they have a beer for you. I'm a hop chaser, so Head Hunter and Hop Juju are my all time faves. If I'm feeling stouty, give me a Bean Me Up! Summertime calls for Goggle Fogger! I much prefer the taproom at the main brewery in Brookpark, but this place is still nice with a ton of seating. Just remember that parking can be a pain, thus the 4 star review instead of 5. Chill out, man! Have a beer!"}
{"text":"I am very torn in this review. I feel like fatheads does some things very well and other things, not so great. 

We go here for the beer. It's some of our favorite. The food is passable. Not the best, not the worst, at least not from what we've had. I love the atmosphere at the entrance and around the bar but the dining room isn't as interesting or warm for me. 

My big beef with this place is all of the staff who mill about the entrance area of the establishment. I've yet to have a good experience with a hostess in this place. The last time we were there, the wait time they gave us was wrong by 45 minutes! They are generally rude, have called us up accidentally, and seem to spend more time chatting with other workers who wander into this area than greeting and seating patrons. 

This area can also be quite crowded on a busy night or a moderately busy time for that matter. I don't really mind that staff are running around up there but I do mind when they are pushing by without as much as an excuse me. We haven't tried the bar on this end, it's just a lot of hassle to get over there to get a drink when it's busy enough to make having one while we wait to be seated worth it. 

Our waiters have always been great so between that, the beer, and okay food they land solidly at a 3."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place for over a year and today I finally had a chance to experience the place for myself. First off; this place is way bigger than I imagined it would be. They can definitely accommodate large tables and plenty of guests.
The beers are incredible, I'm a huge craft beer fan and have always known Fatheads to have good brews, and it was definitely nice to try some of their tapped specials.
Service is friendly and super quick. The waiter was always quick to grab another beer for us, and the food came out 5-10 minutes faster than I expected. I will definitely go back, prices were fair, environment was great, and the menu was huge!"}
{"text":"Being a  huge fan  of craft beer and always looking  for  something new, I knew I'd be  an  absolute  dumb  ass for going  to Cleveland  to see the Tigers  beat the  Indians  without stopping in North  Olmsted to eat and drink at Fat Heads.

At  around 4pm on   a  Saturday,  the  place was pretty  packed.  We walked  through the place to  be  escorted  back  outside  where  our  table  was. The place has  a great aesthetic  and is  surprisingly  big,  but would it hurt  to have a little more lighting? It  was  almost like  a  theater   in  there.   Regardless,  I'd  love to  revisit and stay  inside...  just not when  the weather is so  perfect  outside.

I wound  up  getting a sample  of  five beers (you can pick as many as  you want, and  the Cuyahoga burger. We  also  split the  Bavarian  pretzels  and the  Frickles. The Frickles were well   received  as the breading  wasn't  a soggy mess  like at  some places, and  the Sriracha  dipping  sauce was  great. The Bavarian  pretzels  are also  really good,  but  some didn't  care for   the  spicy  honey  mustard dipping sauce -- wimps! It  tasted great and had  a nice heaty kick to  it. As  for  the beer (I  mean,  it IS a brewery...), I got  Prohibition Pauly  Porter  with Coffee, Goggle Fogger,  Trail Head,  Angels for  ALS IPA, and Bumbleberry. No, I  didn't   get  their critically acclaimed  Head Hunter   IPA because I bought a  four-pack  to  bring home and  enjoy. As  I figured,  all  the  beers were  good  or  better. I'm  not usually huge   on fruity beers,  but  the  Bumbleberry is the perfect fruity  Summer beer.

The  food came out   surprisingly fast  despite  how  busy the place was,  so  the  guys and girls  in the kitchen  know  what  the hell   they're  doing.  I  got my burger cooked  medium   and that's   just how  it  came out.   As  for the  thing   as a    whole,  I've had better  burgers,  but the  value  of   the thing   is  ridiculous, and  it's  still  a  really  enjoyable one.  There's  a good  portion of  pork,  spicy BBQ   sauce,   and  jalapenos.   Really, I  like  really  spicy food,  and   this  made  my nose run  a  little bit. I wasn't expecting it.  Messy, but  not  too  messy  -- the  buns  they  use  really help  with that.

I'd be a fat,  fat   person if  I  lived  in the  area. The  menu   is loaded   with   options  that basically all  sound fantastic, and the portions are  absolutely  huge... I  was  one of two at  the  table  to finish our  order,  and I wasn't  exactly comfortable after  finishing  it  either. There are  a bunch  of items   on the   menu  that  I'd like   to try  next   time I'm anywhere   around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Visited this place while I was in town for work.  I was a lone diner, sitting at the bar.  The bartender was friendly, and his recommendations for both food and beer were spot on.  The beers made here were really great, but I also appreciated the very nice guest beer list.  Not a lot a places will bring in strong competition as guest taps if their won beers can't match up.  This place can.  Food was good and it was a HUGE portion. I wish I was in Cleveland more often, as I would totally come back here."}
{"text":"Building is HUGE. It's a lot bigger than I imagined ... and .. my imagination is vivid! 

It does NOT come across as bland and corporate ..... not over the board sports Bar, either. 

You actually get a warm neighborhood feel from it .. I'm loving their vibe.

I did enjoy their smoked wings .... they were tasty for sure. They were borderline tough ... borderline .... not the tenderness I was expecting.

The house chips were decent.... opt for the fries instead.

Some onion rings went to another table, they looked so good I almost took them off the tray!!!

I ordered some normal wings to go. They were ok ... that was all.

I can't speak on everything but I really enjoyed the smoked wings,!

Enjoy!

There is a cookie store in the plaza where you park. They are delightful and the local cookies are great!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a perfectly cromulent brewery. That's the best I can say. It's a huge, LOUD space, with seating for a couple hundred, along with a smallish patio outside for a bit more seating. 

Pros:
- There is a large and diverse beer selection. They've got quite a few of their own beers. I tried several, and they were all OK. Nothing special, and nothing to write home about.
- The food portions are ridiculously large. Share something with your spouse. Neither will go home hungry.
- Service was fine, aside from a lack of knowledge of the beers.

Cons:
- The menu is so large it's convoluted. They could certain stand with simplifying some things and making it both more streamlined and easier to read. The beer descriptions were hard to make out - and there were some on one sheet and some on another. 
- The server wasn't willing (or able, perhaps) to tell me much about the beers. I'm a huge beer geek, and he could basically read the menu descriptions to me. That's not enough at a brewery.
- I had a bacon onion ring cheeseburger. The onion rings were essentially blackened discs of onion batter - and were far too overcooked. Shouldn't have left the kitchen.
- The kids menu was pretty bad. All the basics, but his pizza was a sad little affair that I felt bad for him having to eat. He's 2, so he isn't picky, but have some pride, folks."}
{"text":"Classic brew pub. The food was really good and portions sizes  are large.  They utilize the NoWait app I suggest you use on busy nights."}
{"text":"Excellent beer brewed here.  Crazy, adventurous & bold American menu.  If you don't like it, you're the problem.  Currently, the reason I love Cleveland."}
{"text":"While Christmas shopping with a friend last week, we decided to leave the mall and journey down the street to check out fat heads for our first time.  We decided to drink samples of each beer as well as order 2 different versions of steak sandwiches.  I thought it was amazing!  I can not wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So normally I wouldn't write a review about a place I frequent, however, I am in the mood ( probably due to the Bumbleberry Beers...my absolute favorite here.) I have never had a bad meal and the portions are huge but appropriately priced. 

Today, I ordered the Steak Salad...my favorite meal.  I could bathe in that bumbleberry dressing...seriously so good.

Their homemade chips are such a good choice if you are just drinking their absolutely delicious craft beer or ordering a side with your meal ( I recommend a side of their ranch to go along with their chips).

And above all, today in particular, as busy as they usually are, their service was excellent. We sat at a high top in the bar area, and our server Dale was excellent.

Best restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"I would of def gave a 5 from my last experience but for my 2nd experience it was just okay. I went there for the first time about a year ago around this time and it was amazing. My boyfriend and I did a date night on a Saturday night. We had a wait so we did bar bowling and darts, had some brews and shared a beer sampler. The holly jolly is amazing. We were pretty tipsy by the time we got to our table so we needed food stat. We both can't remember what we got but it was amazing and we have been talking about going back ever since. 

We went back for our 2nd experience a couple weekends ago for my Dad's 60th birthday. It was on a Sunday and it was around 3pm so it was a late lunch early dinner. The service was not favorable but she did do okay.. she forgot some things here and there and didn't refill any drinks or come back to check on us when we got our food. (she seemed busy though- so not going to fault her). Everyone's burger or sandwich was just 'okay'. I was disappointed because no one in my family has been there before and i was talking it up like it was amazing.  Something definitely lacked that day and i'm sorry it did. It's not going to stop me from trying it again though because the first time was amazing and everyone else that I have talked to said it is really good as well."}
{"text":"Bumble berry is simply the best. I love Fat Heads for a local, close watering hole with some good eats too. The menu is pretty typical bar food, but there is certainly something to please everyone."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Food is good quality but not creative, way too long of a wait for the type of food served. Pretty much the Applebee's menu lol. No veg options that are worth ordering unless you like veggie wraps. Fries are really good and the servers all seem to be super with it. Good spot for larger groups of you don't mind the wait and all the portions are shareable."}
{"text":"Fat Heads Beer was great. Food, was just okay. A lot of deep fried options."}
{"text":"OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDD.

I love this freaking place!

The smoked BBQ wings are out of this world fantastic! I got the Artery Clogger cheeseburger, and I have lived to share my delicious adventure through Fat Head's menu.

Their beer selection is really fun to browse; I ended up choosing a craft Bumble Berry, complete with fresh blueberries in the glass.

The brewery is located inside of the restaurant. 

I think this place is so great, because one of the founders of Great Lakes Brewery (the late Michael Jackson - no, seriously, that's his name!) ventured off and started his own thing, thus being the awesome Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon.

The place is huge, there is a big bar with their original 10+ beers on tap.

Service is great!

Please try this place the next time you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Fat Heads again after a five year hiatus. We had reservations, so we only had to wait about 20 minutes while others waited 1.5 hours! As expected, the beer was excellent. I had a Bumbleberry, which I really liked. 

As an appetizer, I ordered breaded mushrooms, which were delicious, plump, and plentiful. This appetizer fed five of us! We also ordered some jack cheese bites, which were tasty. For dinner, my wife and I split the fish & chips dinner. It was very tasty and well cooked. I'd order it again, but those burgers look very tasty. My wife also ordered some whole BBQ wings, which she liked, but I didn't try.

This time, the food was better than before, so I'm giving another star. The beer is still very good and I can't wait for the new location in Middleburg Heights opens.

Great beer, massively crowded."}
{"text":"We went yet again and had the most awesome waitress. Carmella. She was such an upbeat pleasant person. Very engaging and attentive. Thanks to her suggestions she saved me from burning out my taste buds. She was patient and attentive with the little one and an absolute joy. I wish more wait staff were like her. The food was delicious, as always. But she enhanced our dining experience greatly. Thank you Carmella for the awesome service and for saving me from the killer sauce!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Fat Heads to meet some friends for dinner and was completely impressed by the size and set-up of the brewery. This place is truly built to meet friends and enjoy some great beers while catching up. 

Beers: The selection is plentiful and despite not being much of a beer drinker I throughly enjoyed a couple of the selections. What I really was impressed with was the size of the glasses. I kept it to the small tasters glass, which was about 8oz. This allowed me and others to sample a variety without worry of driving drunk to get back to the hotel. If you're a beer drinker or if this review was solely based on beer it's a 5 Star brewery.

Service: Excellent service from the moment we walked in to the time our server brought the check. We were constantly checked in on, glasses refilled and given guidance on the beer and food selections.

Food: I ordered Fun Guy Burger with an extra order of Onion Rings. The rings were good but a little greasy and heavy on the fry but otherwise pretty good...better than most. The spicy sauce that came with the rings was outstanding. I used it with my burger as well. The Fun Guy was cooked correctly with plenty of the meats juice (so no pressing on the burger while it was cooking, a big plus)! It was topped with portobello mushrooms, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, goat cheese and a one or two other items that I'm sure I'm missing. Overall it was really good and I was pleased with the taste. The fries that came with it were also pretty good.

Cleanliness: I didn't make it to the restrooms nor did I mosey up to the bar so I can't comment there. What I did see at the table was pretty good, especially for being a brewery. 

Overall: The food was good bar food and the beers pretty dang good for non-beer connoisseur as I'm more of a neat whiskey and vodka drinker. As far as I know the beers could be outstanding. Either way I'm going to have to give it a 3.5 on the food and 4 Star on  everything else. Thereby giving it an overall 4 Star with the recommendation of hitting this place with a group of friends as I'm sure you'll have a ball."}
{"text":"Beers are great, food is great. Expect a wait as this place is popular. Parking lot is too small but be patient because the food and drink makes up for any flaws."}
{"text":"The beer and wings are amazing.. some of the best buffalo sauce you can get. However, my one complaint is that their menu is just too large. They don't specialize enough on things they do really well, and there's a lot of food on there that's ok at best. Also, the chips suck and you can sub them for fries."}
{"text":"Fatheads is the premier brewery and restaurant in the general Cleveland area, there's a reason that there is nearly always a wait even during the middle of the week

They consistently grew world class beer and serve up some really solid food!"}
{"text":"Always a favourite. I have been here many times and have had wonderful experiences. Yesterday was no different. Shown are a couple of \"Handwiches\" from their menu. Their food is not for the calorie counters and there beers are legendary in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I have been to Fat Heads more than a few times and I also used to have a roommate who used to work there as well. This review is based off my latest experience about a week ago, on a Thursday @ 8pm. I was with my girlfriend and another couple and there was a wait time of about 15 minutes. From past experience, the place is packed on the weekends, with waits up to two hours on Friday and Saturday peak times. The parking is also challenge with how busy the restaurant is as there is not enough spots to accommodate the guests.
 
We sat down and were greeted shortly after by our server. I was with 3 people who don't necessarily enjoy beer as they all tend to like wine or cider. I ordered a Headhunter IPA from there draft list and I must say this is one of my favorite beers of all time, just the right amount of hops. My girlfriend and her friend ordered a Bumble Berry beer, which in my opinion is wonderful during the summer time, too bad they didn't really enjoy it, oh well more for me! Lots of house brewed beers definitely make this place have an identity. 
 
Our food was brought out shortly after we received our drinks. I split a chicken/artichoke spinach dip with flat breads that was awesome, great flavors and more than enough for 2 people. For our entrée, I got the honey barbeque REGULAR wings and the garlic parmesean REGULAR wings.  I stress REGULAR wings as Fatheads is known for their SMOKEHOUSE wings, which I have had before. They're alright in my opinion but I prefer a more traditional chicken wing. The honey barbeque was up to par with your standard fare but the garlic parmesean were definitely a disappointment (it was as if they just rolled a chicken wing in parmesean cheese and served them, NO garlic taste at all), would NOT get these again. We did also order the appetizer onion rings that are FANTASTIC. They're large and breaded nicely and come with their \"Killer\" Ranch sauce (aka a spicy ranch).
 
The other couple we were with had a mushroom pizza (that was HUGE) and a buffalo chicken wrap. NOTE to people who haven't eaten here before, the BURGERS come with FRIES and the SANDWICHES come with CHIPS (both are the fries and chips are good, especially with the Killer Ranch) and you can't substitute. They also have TONS of crazy types of sandwiches and burgers, along with pizza, salads and burritos. Everyone can find something they like.
 
Our server was top notch, I'm sure he was happy that we were ordering drinks but he was attentive, made sure we had what we needed and got our bill to us right when we asked for it. I must say Fatheads is a good time for beers and greasy food and I would recommend if you have never been before. Although I would recommend heading there on a weeknight rather that the weekend to avoid the place when it's too busy. I would give a 3.5 but everyone knows how Yelp works so I'll give a 4 because of the beer selection is great."}
{"text":"We tried Fat Heads Brewery and I'm not sure what all the great reviews are about.  The beer was NOT good, we tried 4 different beers and none of them hit home with us - then no cold mug or glass just doesn't sit well with me.  The food was NOT good, I had a ham and cheese sandwich which was worse than any fast food place around - it was NOT edible - one bite and I was done, the chips were burnt. Husband had a pulled pork, again subpar - he pulled the meat off the sandwich and ate it, but we've had so much better.  Will NOT return again, not sure what all the positive reviews are about - totally gross!  The bartender was nice though, and she really tried to make it a good experience it just wasn't."}
{"text":"Take out steak salad was just plain awefull. I've had it in the dining room, and it was great...take out sucked. 

It had one quarter of one red potato, no grilled peppers, and the steak was 75% grizzle. The \"greens\" were iceberg lettuce. If I got this dining in, I would have returned it...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Took my wife here on a date. We went on a Friday night and got seated within 20 min. Our server wouldn't stand still long enough to get our whole order, I actually had to stop her from walking away so I could order a beer (I could never get her stationary long enough to order my wife a drink so she stuck with the water that never got refilled).
  My wife got the Rubin melt it was OK but she said she wouldn't come back for it. I had the Triple bypass burger and it was one of the best burgers I have had. Their beer (brewed on site) was amazing. The atmosphere was a little loud but hey it was a Friday night
 I would have given this place 4 stars if the service wasn't so poor."}
{"text":"Time/Day: Various, mostly mid-afternoon, early evening. 

The first thing I love when I enter Fatheads is the unmistakable, beery-hoppy-grassy-oak smell. I live in Ohio City near GLBC, and every time I can smell it in the air, I stop and take a whiff as I smile. Ah, well anyway, onto the review. 

First I'll say I'm not a beer connoisseur. Give me a High-Life, and I'm good. Give me a Miller Lite, hey, I'm doing fine. That said, I'm willing to experiment. On our most recent visit, I had the \"Lazy Magnolia\" (not house made) southern pecan ale. It was very good, and nicely not as syrupy as I'd expected. My inner fat girl said, \"This would be good to use as injectable in a roasting thanksgiving turkey\" -- and if anyone uses the idea, she demands credit. My dining partner had a vanilla porter something or other that to me tasted like flat doctor pepper, which while not bad, was not \"beery\" enough for me. BUT... The BEST drink choice we made was a local mead brewed in Mogadore. The \"Autumn Harvest\" mead was .... nothing short of ambrosial. It wasn't something to drink with a hearty meal, but to be sipped alongside perhaps, with conversation (about how freaking good the mead is), or saved for desert itself. 

Now - I've never had anything \"bad\" at Fatheads. I had pizza once, and I don't think it's fair to judge, because it's not a pizza place. Sure if they offer it, they should know how to cook it, and again, it's not \"bad\", but for me, it was so-so. Fatheads shines at the massive burgers they offer, the wings, and oh, do yourself a favor and share a basket of deep fried, house-beer battered mushrooms. They're not the teeny button mushrooms - they're huge. They come with horseradish sauce... ask for ranch and mix them together. Yum. That alone can and has been our meal. 

I've had good and bad service at Fatheads. Most recently on what shall henceforth be referred to as \"the day we had that awesome mead\" (yes, it was that good), our waitress was rather unattentive. I  had to think it was because we didn't have that big of a check? Anyway, like I said, good and bad service. Like most brewery-restaurants, it depends on what time/day you go. 

I do recommend the place, heartily. We'll definitely go back time and time again, for mushrooms, mead and more."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get to Fat Head's since it opened a couple of months ago. I drive by the former Danny Boy's Farmer's Market everyday on the way to work and had been watching with great interest as the renovation progressed over the last couple of years. 

The doors finally opened to the public recently, but the frequent crowds were pretty good at keeping me from completing my mission.  As it turns out Sunday afternoon was a great time to visit this surprisingly large establishment.

I'm not a drinker, so I can't speak to the beer that seems to be the main reason to visit, but I can say the selection was impressive.  

Prior to visiting, I had checked out the Pittsburg location's menu online  and was interested to see what changes were in store for the Cleveland one.  Most of the items were carried over, with a few nods to our fair city (the Parma Karma, etc.). 

The food was great.  Incredibly large sandwiches stuffed full of deliciousness, accompanied by homemade chips (or fries with burgers).  After much deliberation and a lot of hemming and hawing, I settled on the Bay of Pigs Cuban sandwich, and was glad I did.  Lots of pulled pork, ham, cheese, and pickles with honey mustard and a very hot \"killer sauce\".  Not pressed, like your usual Cuban, but delicious none the less.

The gf had the Euclid Avenue burger, which was pretty much a standard cheeseburger, but she was really happy with it, remarking on how well the meat was seasoned.  The chips and fries were very good, but nothing you couldn't find at most places.  They do, however, compliment the excellent sandwiches.  

We plan on returning, as we barely made a dent in the menu, but it may take a while until the evening crowds subside.  I suggest you make it a point to stop in as well, if you are a sandwich person, I suspect you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Service was beyond bad. First we were seated at a table, a water was brought to us and we then waited over 10 mins for our server to come back, I made it clear when she brought us the water, we wanted to put in an appetizer right away. She then proceeded to help all of her other tables. So I decided it was time to move to the bar. The bar is massive, it's nice. But to have two bar tenders to serve that entire bar is a joke. There were multiple customers with empty beer glasses and drinks at our end of the bar. I even approached the bar tender to ask for a drink and to put in an appetizer and she said I will work my way down...This was my first visit and I was stunned how poorly understaffed the place was for a busy Sunday evening. There are three hostess, really? How about putting one behind the bar..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even more amazing brews. They have a large menu of food and beers on draft. They are famous for their headwhiches aptly named because these sandwiches are giant! And they have a wide selection of their award winning beers available for samples, flights, by the glass, or in growlers so there is something for everyone. Good quality ingredients are used to make their food and the menu prices are very reasonable especially for the large portions they offer. The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is so much fun. It's always a great time spent at fat heads brewery. If you're local it's a must and if you're from out of town it is absolutely worth the trip. 

Check out their website to see the latest beers on draft and what events are coming up"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is awesome and the portions are huge. It's mostly a sandwich place when it comes to food,  but there are many to pick from. It's a brew pub with an outstanding selection of beers which they are always changing so there is usually something new every time you go.   I couldn't ask for much more out of a brew pub.  It's hard to point out where they could improve except for more parking."}
{"text":"First time at fat heads brewery in North Olmsted, and I must say why haven't I been any sooner. The beer is good the food is good the atmosphere is good.
 
All around great place to hang out for the evening with some friends and family. This place is caters to all...

I definitely will be back next week to try more beer and food."}
{"text":"Make sure they give you the bacon you are due. 

My triple bypass burger came with a half slice of bacon and when I asked about the menu description, \"lots of bacon\" they said that was a play on words. 

How does lots of bacon become 1/2 slice of bacon. Do they mean bacon molecules????"}
{"text":"The goods - Head Hunter IPA, Zeus Juice Golden Strong, The Steak-Out

On an overnight stay in Cleveland, I was jubilated to see that there was a brewpub only 1 mile away serving up award winning beer. We were seated immediately upon arriving on a Thursday evening - however the hostesses sat to many tables in a row for one server so we had a bit of a wait to receive our libations. 

As a craft beer \"enthusiast\" (my wife tends to use the term obsessed) I had to try the World Beer Cup gold medal winning IPA  and Golden Strong Ale. Both were delicious and well deserving of their accolades. I was disappointed that the other medal winning beer, the imperial IPA, was out. Win some, lose some. Seriously though, big hoppy beers are my thing, and their IPA was one of the better ones I have had. Highly recommended.

We split a \"headwich, big as your head sandwich\" and, well, it was nearly as big as stated. This was a steak sandwich with onion rings, roasted red peppers, spicy ranch and delicious cheese all piled high on an enormous bun. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned beautifully, the sandwich as a whole was extremely enjoyable and had a nice spicy kick to back it up. It was served with really tasty homemade chips. 

When it was all said and done we had a great meal and extraordinary beers for a perfectly reasonable price. I would recommend this to any craft beer enthusiast."}
{"text":"Love Fat Heads. The beer is the obvious but the food is great too! Big portions and everything is very fresh.  The chips are awesome with your beers!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't visited this place before.  They make a nice assortment brews and also offer a nice selection of guest beers as well.  One of their award winning beers is \"Head Hunter\" and you should try it if you are in to a good hoppy beer.  

On the food front be warned in that their portions are huge.  Nice assortment of sandwiches and I would suggest the \"melts\".  

Great local place and if you are looking for good beer & food you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"They make great beer. I had the pulled pork and my friend had the steak and sausage. He said it was good, mine was alright. The waitress was not good but oh well, it is not like I was in a rush anyway or ever have anything or place to go in a hurry. I don't see why people are always in such a rush. Such as rush hour. You are going to just end up at home 9 times out of 10 and be mad regardless. End up yelling at the wife and hanging out in the garage or whatever married people do."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great beers. If you're ever in the Cleveland area, well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place for birthdays, celebrations and, oh, just because.  The beers are always good.  The food is excellent with the portions being HUGE, not big, but HUGE.  The nachos are made with thin sliced potatoes.  When you order it, tell them you want the sour cream on the side because you are going to be reheating your leftovers for dinner the next day.  Really, you will be unless you are sharing the appetizer with four other people."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland Ohio for the weekend and my boyfriend took me to Fat Heads Brewery to grab a bite to eat. I didn't know what to expect when I first say down but boy-oh-boy was I pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Steak & Egg Headwhich and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Little. Both meals were delicious! DELICIOUS! They were both surprisingly very well seasoned. I don't know why, but I was not expecting that! We also ordered the Smoked Wings with dry rub. They were slightly bland on their own but when combined with the ranch and bbq dipping sauce, they perfection!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time and sat outside. We sampled 6 different beers and they all left a bit of a piney aftertaste, not my favorite but they are award winning. Serving portions are really hearty! The outside seating is right at an intersection which is not fun. It's time to fence that off or move the seating to the back parking lot. Invest in some oversized umbrellas for greater protection from the sun too. The apple tree is pretty neat. Inside has a great energy and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Know you're walking in to a wait and that you're blowing that diet at this place, but if you're looking for beer and comfort food, you're at a great choice.

A favorite of my husband as we both used to live in Pittsburgh where Fat Heads in Southside was just a great way to grab a sandwich to pair with some beer. This brewery is no different. 

If you're looking for a generous portion of some comfort food Fat Heads has you covered. While there are better options for smoked meat in the area, the combo of wings and beer works here. The pizza is decent, but the real shinning star is the selection of sandwiches. The chips are an excellent touch and something you can appreciate more with each drink. Great for game days, laid back family meal, or a casual date night. 

Fat Heads beer menu has a large selection so if you're a beer drinker, there will be something here for you to try. As you can find Fat Heads outside the brewery, take the time to work your way through a few new ones you want to try and grab a growler to go home. 

Oh and don't forget the pretzel appetizer, because obviously...beer and pretzels."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place but be prepared to wait! It's always super busy!! Great beers , great staff! The bartenders know lots about beer!! Split the food with someone  or come super hungry bc it's HUGE !! The parm fries are amazing! So good!! Great wings, and even great desserts! We would join the mug club but have no idea how to!?!?"}
{"text":"Delish food! Super large portions, yummy beers and you can get samples of them in cute lil glasses.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to the Saloon as we had been to the tap house in Middleburg Heights. We started with the pretzel sticks which were good but not as good as the pretzel you can get at the Tap house. After the pretzels we ordered the pulled pork chili fries and we were not disappointed! The chili itself has to be in my top 5 alone. Add it to the fries with a sunnyside egg on top and you have a masterpiece. The party I was with all ordered 1/2 a dozen smoked wings. We had the backyard BBQ, honey chipotle, and beasty BBQ. Now just to clarify, the wings without sauce I amazing in their own right. The smoky flavor is just the right amount of charcoal flavor. These wings are easily in my top 2 ever. Adding the sauces just enhances the flavor. I highly recommend the beasty BBQ if you like spicy. The beer was excellent as well. We had the starlight, bumbleberry, goggle fogger and duke bier. Out of those the bumbleberry was my least favorite. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"When I think of Cleveland, I normally think of the many times I visited Great Lakes Brewery.  However after visiting Fat Heads with a friend to watch the Browns play, I am about to switch loyalties.  The food and service was great, but the beer was even better.  My husband and I ordered the sampler, and we were impressed with the quality of the beers.  Their holiday stout was superior."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner with friends while we were dropping off my brother-in-law at the CLE airport.  We went on a Saturday (late afternoon).. it was pretty busy but we had only a two or three minute wait.

The burger/sandwich/sub/panini list is huge.. almost overwhelming at first.  I'm sure I could have picked at least a dozen options I'd be more than happy with.  I settled on the Parma Sutra, which laid cheddar, bacon, onions and a pierogi on top of a half pound burger with a side of creamy horseradish.  It's a great concept for a burger, and it was as good as it sounds  We also shared a few appetizers - the spinach artichoke dip w/ fried pita was especially good.

I tried the flight of house-brewed samples.  I wouldn't say I was blown away by any of them, though the Bavarian-style was quite good. Their holiday varieties were also commendable.

I don't think I can quite dish out five stars on Fatheads.. but I considered it.  Maybe an 8.25-8.50 ish if you're looking for a more specific score."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at fat heads. Have yet to have a bad experience. Tonight I took the family there for dinner. We were seated quickly for a Friday afternoon and our server was there instantly. She was very polite and attentive. Our meals came pretty fast and she came back to check on us often. They changed the selection of beer that I was used to and she even went to ask if they had one similar to one of my favorites which they did! We all left stuffed and happy! Definitely returning !"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on the 4th of July. We didnt have to wait to be seated. Took a few minutes for our server to arrive and take our drink orders. She was apparently not happy to be working on the 4th and it showed! We ordered the  sampler of 8 different beers. They were ok, nothing great. My husband ordered a sandwich. It was giant, but he said it wasnt anything great. I ordred the black bean veggie burger and it had no taste at all. Overall we were disappointed. The service was not very good and the food was mediocre. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Called ahead for a large table... when speaking to the host on the phone she assured us that we would have a table upon arrival. When our large party arrived they claimed that we had not called ahead..... I pulled out my phone and showed the manager my recent calls and provided the name of the employee I spoke to.... this was a huge inconvenience for all of us. Will not make arrangements to come here again."}
{"text":"First time here happened to be Friday the 13th. It was a late bday dinner with a good friend and my daughter. She left earlier, then the taste testing started :)

Needless to say, beer selections awesome. The Pumpkin seasonal is real real good. Head Hunter is my go to. The food selection is overwhelming, not in a bad way, its just huge. I had a chicken sandwich, it was pretty amazing tasting, cant wait to go back. They definitely give you a bang for your buck. They're no slouches on their portions, that's for sure. 

The service was excellent, friendly atmosphere and cool environment. Friends, families, co-workers, any situation you'll fit right in. All the merchandise gives it a cool look. It smells very strong like hops when you walk in, I wasn't attracted to that. Not too appealing. Id suggest sitting in the back section, if possible. 

Awesome place though, definitely do attend, I know ill be back. Its not the last they've seen of this man!!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why Fat Head's is packed on a regular basis. I came with a friend that raves about this place week after week and finally had to come see for myself. 

The wait for a table of 7 on a Saturday night was supposed to be about 2 hours but the table opened up and we realistically waited a little over an hour. We ordered some appetizers which came relatively quickly - onion rings and nachos. The onion rings looked burnt but they weren't and had a definite kick to them! The nachos were a massive pile of chips with toppings and while not my personal preference (jalapeno smell from across the table) they were gone from the other table mates.

I split a \"headwich\" with my bf since the appetizers were so much food. We ordered \"The Fat Italian\" served with a big pile of homemade chips. And it's no joke that the sandwich is roughly the size of your head. I cut into it and all the fillings came sliding out. The sandwich was delicious and for me was the highlight of the meal.

Note: I'm not a drinker so I can't vouch for the beer but my beer connoisseur friend certainly can! There's a reason why he's a regular here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fatheads for years and I must say it's always a pleasure. Just note that their food menu is typical bar food but they give you a lot of food so don't over order! The Beer is fantastic beyond any other Brewery, these guy's do every style perfect. If I had one bad thing to say which isn't even an issue is that if you want fries you have to order a Burger they will not substitute chips for fries. But in their defense the chips are damn good especially with the cheese dip."}
{"text":"Great place...great food...great beer.Busy... but they move you thru pretty fast. So many beers...got the Holly Jolly..."}
{"text":"I will make it real simple.  If you like great beer go here (seriously its as good as it gets).  If you like food that makes you ashamed of yourself but is so good you dont give a $%^&....head on in.  

Problems with FH's:
Parking sucks
Packed to the hilt on the weekend

If there is a way to tear down that strip mall but somehow keep Ohashi Sushi spot and expand FH's I would not have to think so much about where to eat on the weekend."}
{"text":"Place is packed  good selection of craft beer. Huge food menu. The other party chose order of fried mushrooms. A badketfull of fried shrooms for the tqble. We picked mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce  4 thin sticks for 7.99. Def not a good value.  We had burgers and fries and buritto and homemade chips and a large salad   the shredded bbq pulled pork was humongous and gave 1/2 away. Would have preferred more rice in the burrito. But def had a lot od meat.  Def a great place for large groups"}
{"text":"Caveat Fudium.  (Let the Foodie Beware.)   Updated from 2/24/12

An example of F.F.T.H.  (Fell for the Hype.  Pronounced 
f-f-t-h;  often a sudden, epiphany-like state.) 

It hurts me to update---because the manager was understanding and apologetic---but I felt it was my civic duty to inform anyone out there who eats food.  And if you haven't yet tried Fat Heads, don't let this deter you.  Read the other commentaries---you just might miss out on something you'd fall head-over-drunken-heels with.    

The food on a recent drop-in---just about 10 days after a 4 star visit---was responsible for 3 stars being \"Chopped\".   Of the three different menu choices, two were unacceptable and one was inedible.  While all eateries can plate up losers once in a while, 3 out of 3 in a single order even made Fat Head blush with embarrassment.   (Red-cheeked image on the new beer OOPS, perhaps ?)

*  The beef CHEESEBURGER was so dry that it was nearly indistinguishable as a meat product.  All that could be tasted was bun and cheese.

*  The BABY BACK RIBS were also dry, and tasted as if just plain-old-oven-roasted---a preparation anyone with no cooking skills at all, can achieve---and without a hint of  \"char-grilled to perfection\" stated in the menu description. 

Now, the worst.

If something isn't 100%, I won't hold it against a restaurant as long as it passes my Edible Test.  That's generally about 75%---when I'm in a good mood, which I usually am.   I do have higher expectations for the $$$$$, but bend more readily for the $ and $$.  

Menu descriptions that simply list ingredients are enough for me---and safer for the food spot.  Any embellishing, however, can backfire for the establishment, as is the case with \"FAT HEAD'S ORIGINAL CHEESE STEAK\".   \"...best...you will ever eat.  Really.  Honest....\" ---even a shamelessly arrogant (but harmless) tongue-in-cheek reference to Philadelphia's Liberty Bell.  I'll admit, that after reading, I couldn't wait to order.   WHERE'S OUR SERVER??!!   If anyone had tried, NO ONE could have convinced me to choose anything other than that Cheese Steak off Fat's extensive menu.

Ahhh...  Impressive looking and HUGE---enough for 3 average healthy appetites to share---and it was ALL MINE.  LET'S EAT!   

uh.  I can't remember tasting the many extras layered within.  It's a blur.  It was the meat that drew all my attention.  At the very first bite I knew that I'd have my work cut out for me.  Gristle.  I don't like it.  Never did---never will.  I discreetly removed the generous portion, hid it in a napkin, then crunched on a few of their homemade chips (quite good).   No Cheese Steak Bite Number Two for me.   No way.  Working up the courage, I cautiously lifted that top bun.  

I'd discovered the mother-lode.  

After finger-prospecting through just the top two beef slices for any good parts, I soon knew it was a lost cause.  If I took the time to trim it, I'd be there until closing.  Not just on the edges, but like a topographical map of Minnesota and its thousand lakes, the slices were permeated throughout, assuring chewy inedibleness.   

With the manager present, we testified one by one giving accounts of our displeasure, and in summation I presented a slice of cheese steak evidence for him to see with his own eyes.  He'd been apologetic and understanding from the onset---explaining how things are prepared, that's the way it's delivered, etc, and offering to get us something else we might like---but when apprised with visual proof by way of Exhibit G, by then he probably knew we'd pass on any alternates.  We declined his offer, he said (of course) no charge, and we left.  But not before urging him---at the very least---to have their steak meat precision-trimmed before serving (quite honestly?  not possible)---or even better---switching to an edible, fit-for-human-consumption grade.

Gristle.  Pretty much a fact of meat life.  Other than the esteemed filet (if prepped properly before cooking), most steaks that are intended to be eaten with a knife and fork will likely have some.  BUT---it can be removed easily enough because IT'S VISIBLE.  Gristle should NEVER be hidden---lying in wait---between buns, rolls, or slices of bread.  That's at the top of my Culinary Sins list.  Unappetizing for the eater, and for anyone who happens to glance over during the Act of Detection and Ejection.  

Major disappointment.  Especially since we told a newie about our better-than-average visit just days before, and convinced him to accompany us that second time.   

Despite all this, my suggestion is to \"go for it\".  Who knows?  You might luck out just like we did the first time.  And if our experience with management is any indication of Fat's overall commitment to customer satisfaction---they'll make it right if it's wrong.

{"text":"Stopped here on a work trip to Cleveland. I tried many beers and some food and overall thought the beer was really good and the food was nothing special. I will add that the food here is not the style of food I like (makes me think of a chain restaurant) and that certainly influences my opinion. But if you like humongous portions of food of mass produced chain restaurant quality (I honestly don't mean that as an insult) then you will probably like this place. I came here with a large group on a Tuesday and they were super busy and packed. We ended up just eating and drinking in the area by the pool tables while standing and sitting on stools. If you are coming here I would recommend maybe checking if they take reservations since they were so busy on a weekday. But they do have plenty of room to stand and wait and even play pool or skee ball so it's not that bad if they don't.

First the beer. I was not real familiar with Fat Head's before coming here. I had only heard of them but never tried their beer. Due to this I wanted to try a sample flight so that I could try multiple styles to get an idea of what the brewery offers. Their flights are huge with eight beers included and you don't get to choose which beers go on the flight. It includes the first eight beers on the menu which is a little disappointing because some of those styles I definitely wouldn't have ordered. I am also used to flights at other breweries only containing four or five beers so that if I find one I really like I can drink a pint of it afterwards without having to drink too much beer. But this would be fine if you wanted to split a flight between two people. After the flight I also ordered an individual sample of another beer because I wanted to try all the medal winning beers they had on tap.

The nine beers I tried were Pumpkin Chucker Stout, Head Hunter IPA, Angels for ALS IPA, Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale, Rye Saison, Boogaloo Belgian Blonde, Caveman Keller Beer, Alpenglow Weizenbock, and Bonehead Imperial Red Ale. The Pumpkin with chocolate and spices was good and I am not the biggest fan of pumpkin beers but I do like a good stout and this wasn't overly spiced or sweet with good malt flavor. The Head Hunter is a quite good west coast style IPA with a real piney hop flavor and I can understand why it has won multiple medals. The Angels on the other hand was a real citrusy fruit forward IPA which I loved and would definitely drink again if I had the chance. The Bumbleberry is a blueberry ale and was definitely my least favorite because I just don't like blueberry beers but it wasn't overly sweet but it had tons of blueberry aroma on the nose. The Rye Saison was good and was also one of my favorites with some good yeast flavors. The Boogaloo was a pretty typical tasting Belgian blonde with the yeast being the prominant flavor and some sweetness to it. The Caveman was also one of the beers I didn't like as much with noticeably less carbonation and nothing that really jumps out as a defining feature but it would be good for someone who likes a more ordinary beer without much hops and a little sweet malt flavor. The Alpenglow was another favorite as a wonderfully balanced and tasty wheat bear. The Bonehead had a sweet flavor expected from an imperial and with noticeable hops and was a good overall beer.

And now for the food. Before I ordered any food an order of Bacon Cheddar Fries was ordered as an appetizer by someone to share. It came out as a mountain of fries that would have killed anyone that tried to eat the whole thing. It was covered in copious amounts of cheddar cheese sauce (yes, sauce, not cheese but cheese sauce) and topped with a large amount of crumbled bacon. The quality is something I would find at a baseball game with cheese sauce being the defining point but for what I would consider to be total junk food it served it's purpose and others liked it. I then ordered The Southside Slopes Headwich which came out once again looking huge and unwieldy. The bun itself was the biggest thing dwarfing the contents of the sandwich but the fillings themselves were abundant as well. It contained a large keilbasa sliced lengthwise, pierogies fileed with cheese, american cheese, onions, and horseradish sauce. Once again I would complain about the processed American cheese on the sandwich, but otherwise I thought the sandwich was good. I liked the sausage and the pierogies were actually really good on a sandwich and every so often through the mouthful of bread, meat and cheese I would taste some zing from the horseradish. I wouldn't eat here regularly because I would surely have a heart attack but it's not bad sometimes while drinking a lot of beer.

Overall, I liked the beer a lot and would defintely drink Fat Head's beer again. The food is overbearing chain restaurant food but all things have a place and the food was not bad just nothing special in my opinion. The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Monster Menu, Fantastic Beer List. Something for everyone! 

Every time we're here, it's a great time and fantastic food/beer.

A terrific place to take out-of-towners for a taste of local Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place - mostly from my Pitt friends. Before we moved from CLE, I had to try it out. 

Disclaimer: I am not a huge beer fan. But, I did really like the blueberry beer. They even had some blueberries floating in it! Cute. :) 

We both ordered burgers. The fries that came with them were perfect. The burgers were just OK.... they should probably focus less on making them HUGE and more on making them have huge flavor. I wasn't the biggest fan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Breweries in the Cleveland area. It's become a must stop at every time we're in town. Some of the best beers on tap and the food is absolutely fantastic. This is the one brewery that I talk about to all my friends that they have to visit in Cleveland. So if you're planning a fun night of food and drinks. Think Fatheads! Try the Fried Mushrooms!!!!"}
{"text":"Beer was ok, food was ok. Nothing bad, just not the best"}
{"text":"If I would've written this after my first few visits, I would've given this place 5/5. Unfortunately, the past few times I've dined there the food took FOREVER to get to the table, drink refills were scarce, and the food just was not as good as it was early on in their business (or for the check total). I'm not saying that I'll never dine there again, but I also won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"You gotta eat the wings with bumble berry at this place. The wait is a bit longer than expected but its worth it.  The waiter was a little strange."}
{"text":"Wow the beers are great (gogle fogger was the big winner of the night).  And the food was great too, loved the fresh cut frys. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how big their menu is here and at how good the food was!!  Huge portions and lots of beer options.  This was definitely a nice addition to N. Olmsted.

It sounds like this place still gets packed on the weekends so be prepared for a wait unless you come in at an off time."}
{"text":"One of the best breweries in the US.  Whenever my friends fly into Cleveland, this is always our first stop as a \"welcome to Cleveland\" from me. Great atmosphere, great beer, food is great if you get the right things.  (Parm garlic wings, Italian headwich, burger is good, parma karma app is great,  mushroom app is awesome, pizzas are good.  Amazing IPAs!  They just opened one in Portland, OR.  Looking forward to seeing how they do on the west coast."}
