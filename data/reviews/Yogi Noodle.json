{"text":"First time at Yogi. Had the laksa soup base with Shanghai noodle. It was just ok. Also had the lemongrass pork chop which was pretty good. The restaurant was bright and clean, however with non ergonomical seats. Menu is extensive. Would come back to try other stuffs"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here before, so decided to drop by with a friend around 9 pm on a Tues night after going to the gym together.    The $8.99 Sizzling Plate Special menu instantly caught my eye. Pretty rare finding sizzling plate items under $10.   You choose: 2 meat items (Add $2.99 for each additional item),  a side, a sauce & a drink    My order: Steak & Italian Sausage, upgraded to Fries ($1 extra), Gravy & Hot Milk Tea My friend's order: Deep Fried Chicken & Italian Sausage, Spaghetti, Black Pepper Sauce & Hot Milk Tea   Portions weren't too big, but just enough for me. Steak & Sausage were pretty standard. The Fries were the extra crispy kind I like (they are the same as Costco fries my friend informed me). I tried a bit of my friend's chicken and it was really dry. Actually a lot of the other meat item choices are deep fried before they place it on the sizzling plate. This i didn't like. I expected this to cause the meats to be really dry so I was limited in my selection. The black pepper sauce was a bit too salty. My friend realized that after mixing her spaghetti with it and couldn't finish it. I ended up mixing some of my gravy into her spaghetti to mellow out the flavour and finished it for her.  All in all, if you make the right choices, the sizzling plate specials makes a decently priced okay meal. I'll probably be back to try other stuff.  Bonus: free wifi, pw is posted near the counter (not many hk-style cafe i know of that offers free wifi)"}
{"text":"Best Hong Kong-style Stir-fried Rice Noodle with Beef () in Toronto.   The other Yogi in Richmond Hill is not the same.    Their milk tea is good as well!!"}
{"text":"great restaurant , has the HK cafe feel , food is quick and many selections . The staff is also really friendly , ive noticed on different days there are different chefs . i like to go on similar days to catch the chef that cooks my food order the way i originally tasted it. nothing wrong with the other chef but it is a different style of cooking. Anyways  i reccomend to get the HK milk tea or Cold lemon tea when visiting"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Ordered a korean style beef noodle. It was ready in 5 minutes and when i saw it. I realized it was instant noodle with three slices of beef... Seriously?!  At least change the noodle so I wouldn't see the curly instant noodle and I probably wouldn't notice it was instant noodle with the same sauce from that instant noodle pack. Even the vegetable was the dried veggies from the same pack.   I understand cutting cost but this is just pathetic. I know it is a cheap place but I never thought a legit business can go this low."}
{"text":"Comfortable environment, price is ok. I like the Udon. They used to serve Japanese style Udon. But no more now. Just regular udon for $4.75 with hot drink."}
{"text":"Been at this HK style restaurant a couple times now so I thought I'd write a review.   Service is decent, mainly Cantonese but can understand English.  Food is pretty good. They can adjust your order based on how you eat too.   Pricing is decent. I come here for one of their awesome specials, pick any 2 sizzling food platters for 8.50 including rice, sauce and a drink (coffee, tea, cold soy milk). I usually get beef steak and chicken steak cause that right there is where the money's at. Extra charge to change it up, obviously.   They only accept cash but there is a Scotiabank nearby.   Parking is average since the place is situated beside a Chinese grocery store, but you can find parking. I suggest you park a bit farther to walk off what you eat.  Pretty typical HK style seating and noise level: Mild.   Overall, decent place to eat if you want something quick and delicious, like steak! Free WiFi as well, just remember noodle123!   Honesty, I can't emphasize how awesome their 2 sizzling food plate combo is!"}
{"text":"I only come here before 11am. This is when you can get really good deals here for HK breakfast food. We had the Satay beef macaroni in soup and butter toast with condense milk (highly recommend for hangovers). It was extremely cheap and worth it ($5)."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible congee...idk how you can screw that up but they managed to. Got the clam and salted yolk congee and the clams were barely opened and there were barely any ingredients in it except for the hard stalks of this bitter vegetable. The steamed cheung fun that came with it was soggy and they didn't bother cleaning the sides of the plate before presenting it. This place used to be better but is going downhill and you can tell with the lack of care in the food and service."}
{"text":"Visit time: Sunday morning around 10:30am. Ordered from the breakfast menu (serve till 11am)  You can still ask for the lunch menus.  3 people, ordered: ================= - set M) fried chicken fillet on soup udon, with buttered toast and hot milk tea, $5.50 I think  - set N) preserved vegetable with shredded pork on soup vermicelli, with buttered toast, omelette (choice of ham or mushroom) with hot coffee, $4 I think  - HK style French toast with hot coffee, $2.99  Pros: ============== - have wifi, heard table next to us asked for wifi password, I didn't use it though so can't comment further - set M is quite filling! the chicken piece was huge, thick, juicy and tasty. It practically covered the whole bowl. I barely could finish the meal. Left half a piece of toast. - set N ham omelette was very well cooked and good portion, looks to be about 2 eggs - French toast was well cooked to perfection - decor is new, modern and clean (we had booth seats near the back) - HK TVB channel on TV - speed of service is reasonable, consider there's probably is 1 guy working back there at that hour, but good thing everything seems fresh and made at order. e.g. chicken piece wasn't pre-fried or something :)  Cons: ================= this is where I must dock stars...  - the woman worker who took our order give me the impression she's a bit impatient, her tone could use a bit more friendliness (just her, the young male server who took care of our dishes and bill seem more polite, the same goes for the male owner from observation) - set N, preserved veggie with pork portion is a bit light for the bowl size - soup flavor of noodle was bland, had better - milk tea was OK, not the worst, but definitely had better, I still prefer the milk tea at Lai Doh in Splendid China   So thrown off by the woman and the so-so noodle soup and milk tea, thought about giving 2.5 stars, but that seems a bit harsh, considering I didn't actually tried their lunch and dinner offerings. So I'll give 3 star.  So based on these breakfast items, prices are reasonable for the amount of food. Quality is generally OK. But HK style breakfast is really not exciting foods to rave much about :) I'm still not sure if I would be coming back any time soon, considering there's other choices.  Sorry, no pictures."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this establishment for a few times during my high school years since this restaurant is conveniently located near Dr.Norman Bethune Collegiate Institute. This is a typical Hong Kong Style restaurant. The service is very good. The waiters understand mainly Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. The food is very tasty, especially their lunch specials. I would recommend ordering either a Porkchop with rice served with either a Curry/Garlic/Black Pepper Sauce. The dinner You can expect to pay $8-$10 for a meal, but it is worth it for some homestyle HK food.  The dinner selections are very decent, I would recommend the Stir Fried Beef with Chinese Broccoli. Overall, come to this place if you are looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I think I lost 5 years of my life eating here. =O  My arm/shoulder started feeling numb after eating here! It must be all that salt / MSG. This never happens to me!  I had the custom order special Noodle in Soup. You choose your noodles, 2 meat and soup base for $8.99. The meat choices are low quality. It does come with a hot HK milk tea. $1 extra if you want it cold.  It's conveniently located in the Foody supermarket plaza, with tons of parking ... and fast service. But I just feel like the food is low quality. It took 2 hours to get the feeling back in my arm.  =/"}
{"text":"Avoid the bench seats. I found them very uncomfortable. Decent food, fair price and sevice otherwise. Good place to get quick lunch before a grocery run at Foodys."}
{"text":"Food was not great, but not terrible either.   Only thing was that the service sucked. Had to ask for tea and they had to redo my order - which took a long time.   Not memorable. Very mediocre."}
{"text":"So 6 of us came since they said it was very good. I had the fish and spaghetti. It was ok and my friend was the same. The service is pretty good. The owner is not cheap because I wanted a different sauce for my fish and she didn't charge me. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Above average HK cafe with lots of food options. Yogi Noodle is better than Phoenix Restaurant when it comes to price, service, and food quality. In fact, Yogi Noodle may be one of the best HK cafes out there.  I tried their corned beef sandwich and I find it tasted better than any other HK cafe around, and it is one of the cheapest too. The corned beef is not salty at all, and has good bun to meat ratio.  My BF tried the minced pork in soup, and found the noodle is very tasty. This is definitely a new place to try out if you'd like cheaper HK food with good quality.  To drink I got their cold milk tea and it was soo good!  I will be coming back to try their dinner specials, especially their baked spaghetti bolognese."}
{"text":"It's a hidden little noodle/Hong Kong cafe stop, but a great place to go!  I really enjoy the build your own noodles. I highly recommend the no msg fish soup base. It's so milky and comforting and you can drink it! I usually get thick vermicelli with fish skin, octopus balls, and beef tendon which are marinated with a delicious flavor!  The baked dishes are a great selection as well. Good portions and never too salty.   Definitely a place to go if I'm in the area and hungry. :)"}
{"text":"The rice in Hainanese chicken rice is very hard, like uncooked rice. The chef said they hv no problem with that.   Extra sauce needs $0.50   Everything is meh....."}
{"text":"Yogi Noodle is a solid HK style restaurant in my opinion, I frequent here when I come to get groceries at Foody Mart.   Environment: There are lots of parking space at the Bamburg Plaza, in comparison to the T&T plaza slightly off North, coming here is a wayyyy better experience for me. The restaurant itself itself is quite small, they have some 4 person booth seats and some larger round tables for around 6 people. Kids high chairs are available if needed.  Food: The menu is gigantic, it basically has everything you can imagine in Chinese Southern Cuisine and some more westernized food. Personally I like their Vietnamese Chicken on rice, the Sizzling Steak on Hot Plate, and the make it your own noodles (the fish soup base is pretty good). Usually all these dishes comes with a hot drink on the side and it costs extra $1 if you want to substitute for a cold one.   Service: Your typical Asian restaurant service, no designated waiter for your table, free for call for anyone for service."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Never had congee so terrible.  The congee was blend and the meat in my congee had blood oozing out."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Yogi Noodle has been in existence for a while, but I usually never bothered going to this plaza since it's always so busy. I decided to this past weekend because I was nearby and figured I'd have dinner at the least busiest of the popular establishments here (Yogi, Pho88, D&R Wings). Sure enough Yogi Noodle attracted me the most, so that was my place for dinner.  This place has a lot of dinner or other related specials, so it took me a while to read through all of them. At the end, I decided to opt for the $8.99 sizzling plate specials, in which you were to choose two of the several selections available. I opted for an angus beef steak and black forest ham.  The funny thing with my meal was that I enjoyed the black forest ham more than the angus beef steak. The ham was thick cut and juicy; just the way I like it! The steak, on the other hand, was thin cut, but I guess considering it was $8.99 I shouldn't have expected much from it. Still tasted great though. A suggestion though: Whatever you normally order your steak (medium, medium well, etc), go one notch down for this place. I like my steak medium, but ended up with a medium well steak cause I didn't realize the steak would be so thin.  The meal came with a drink, but no soup of the day. The iced lemon tea I ordered was passable, but I've definitely had better.  Service was good considering the setup of the restaurant. I was seated at the back corner of the restaurant, but they were largely aware that they had customers there, so it wasn't too hard waving someone down.  Another restaurant to add to my pool...if only the parking lot wasn't so busy."}
{"text":"Hainan chicken - 3/5 very mediocre. The chicken was tender but was not very juicy. The rice had a solid chicken taste stock but a bit mushy. The sauces were not paired accurately. The meal was good for its price but room to improve authenticity.   Calamari - 4.5/5 bit crispy outside and tender on the inside, very flavorful, recommend"}
{"text":"Service was great and the fish base noodle soup we got were really large I wasn't able to finish and my bf did but we both didn't end up having dinner after coming here for lunch. Would definitely come and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"My personal favourite & Maybe the best HK style restaurant in Bambirgh Circle, I love their Hainan chicken combo with delicious everyday soup and an 0.5$ add on for either Milk tea, Coffee or Lemon Tea( recommending milk tea so well-made:), which makes it an 10$ combo including tips. Their Wanton Noodle is well-served as well with an free drink-with the same price you get more from Yogi, and with the same quantity you get lower price here as well, plus the friendly service that is rare (not kidding:( in Bambirgh circle, Yogi is definitely becoming my first choice here."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy crispy tofu with rice and had a taro bubble tea. Service was fast, food was hot and all was good! The tofu was delicious.  The bubble tea was just okkkkk they added some extra lychee jelly because they ran out of tapioca which I wasn't a fan of. I know for next time to ask for no jelly. Been here a couple different times, usually busy and always open late. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food is delicious especially their Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice or the Baked Seafood Rice. I mainly order their rices their because it's just so tasty!  Fair prices for the taste and portion of the food. Almost all dishes are complimented with a soup/drink.   A great selection of Chinese dishes to choose from. Service is decent."}
{"text":"We ordered three dishes: Guilin-style soup noodles, a pork chop on rice, and a baked garoupa on spaghetti. The dishes also came out in that order, but with a gap in between their deliveries. There was about a five minute gap between the first two. The last two had a huge gap - maybe half an hour or more! The first two dishes were completely eaten by the time we got the last one. My poor mom had to wait as we kept reminding the waitresses. One of the waitresses even suggested that we had already eaten it! The sad part was that the baked garoupa was the only bad dish; the other two were pretty good. We've eaten here before with no problems, which is why they're getting two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Yogi Noodle?? Yogi going to Yogi Noodle??  Yogi Noodle has nothing to do with yoga in any shape or form. It is just a HK Style Restaurant.  The selections here is pretty good. And the price is reasonable. They have all day specials or Breakfast or lunch Specials. So you can always order something that has free drink!  The Satay Beef with Noodle is $5.25 that comes with a drink is great choice for lunch. The portion is sizable and I was full after eating that for lunch! You can upgrade your drink to cold drink for 75 cents.  The service is quick and friendly!  Cash only!  Parking can be a problem since there is this big grocery store in the same plaza. I even have problem finding one on a weekday lunch time!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want cheap, comfort food. I wouldn't say it's the cleanest place, but the food is cheap and good enough to compensate."}
{"text":"Yogi Noodle ... not the cheapest HK cafe out there...   keeping in mind i did not come during any of their specials... i ordered the steak and fish with pepper sauce and spaghetti bolognese.  pepper sauce is not bad... its your typical HK style diner.. but expect to pay maybe a dollar or two more."}
