{"text":"We made a reservation for 9:45pm and we were seated immediately. Isabel was our server and she was amazing! She went through the entire menu with us and also helped us select a fabulous bottle of wine. We started with the grilled calamari, fresh mozzarella, and rabbit tourine. All incredible. We had a 2010 Pinot Noir (movia modri) from Slovenia. It was so interesting- not like an American Pinot at all. Earthy, leathery and tannins. Excellent selection. We also had the poached halibut in olive oil and the lobster spaghetti (best pasta dish I've had since visiting Italy!). We ended with the cornbread cake topped with corn ice cream and also the oatmeal cookie with raisin sorbet. An outstanding first meal in Montreal! We love this place!"}
{"text":"totally not worth it, we order lobster spaghetti and lamb shoulder,lamb too salty, spaghetti stick twister, for this price, u can get much better,not recommended at all"}
{"text":"I know you'd probably expect a better star rating but I'd have to say I  also expected more than I got. 

First of all, the food is good. It's really quite good. But not always excellent. The portions are copious but the presentation is non existant. It feels like you're on a farm almost. I can see how that's fun but in that case, it might be a little pricy for the farm experience. 

Second, service is good but it left me with the impression that the emphasis was on the upsell and not on the dining experience. If you go, I recommend the  second service, that way, you'll stay longer and enjoy the evening. Wine selection is good but not all the waiters are apt at suggesting the right bottle. 

All in all, it's definitely worth the visit and it probably it would have earned at least another star if not for the price or the impersonal experience."}
{"text":"Def up there with one of the most memorable meals I've had. Decor/ ambiance is very hip - dark room, tables stuck close to one another, blackboard menu. The food was outstanding. I shared the eel nuggets and asparagus/goat cheese plate for appetizers. Both were very good. Mains consisted of the lobster spaghetti and joe beef steak. The lobster was amazing- large chunks of lobster in a creamy pasta sauce. The steak was one of the best I've ever had- juicy, cooked to perfection,  come with sautéed buttery spinach. Yum! Dessert was good but not as good as the main meal- a layered cake of chocolate and hazelnut. Service was friendly and efficient. Overall, I had a great evening! Of course, the prices are up there, so best to save up for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"It's worth the wait. It's worth the cost. It's worth the crowds. It's worth losing your eyesight due to the crap lighting and microscopic chalkboard writing they call a \"menu.\" The food at Joe Beef is nothing short of edible sex. Great sex. Hot, steamy, mind-blowing sex with your ex.  The ex you hate as a person, but could fuck every day for the rest of your life.  That sex.  I had the horse steak and almost ejaculated at the table (it was wrapped in bacon)."}
{"text":"Ein echter Geheimtipp in Montral! Essen ist super, nicht nur das Fleisch, auch der Fisch! Nicht ganz billig aber echt jeden Cent wert! Nicht ohne Reservierung hingehen, da es nur ein paar Tische gibt die immer voll sind!!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food was the service.  The food was tasty, filling and an exceptional variety of tastes that were mouth watering.  Fresh oysters, the house Bloody Caesar, smoke meat nuggets, burrata with veg, small portion of lobster spaghetti.  All of it tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"Though the food was good, it was not at the level I had expected. The double down foie gras was excellent, but the canard aux cherises was, I felt, cooked unevenly. Some pieces were great and others gave my jaw a good workout. The service was nothing special...but it was adequate. The The ambiance was nothing special except the buffalo head. My preference is for The Tuck Shop down the street.

I would go back, but only for the foie gras."}
{"text":"always a great time... the servers are expertly trained in their knowledge of wine and have great recommendations. One of the best restaurants in Montreal, hands down."}
{"text":"What an experience.  Once I got over reading the menu off a chalk board in French.  Thank god for 3 weeks of culinary French in college.  I settled in to what was one of my most memorable meals to date.  

I tried Cheval for the first time- Amazing!  I had a yummy St. Joseph Rouge!  Amazing!  The service staff were young, hip, and very well educated.  Also the music was 90's hip hop- Amazing!"}
{"text":"I do not complain often but.... pretentious staff for a bill of 800$ for 2 peoples. They think they are over their \"shit\"especially the blond manager. Obviously, they have no respect for customers. Low level of customer service or class. 

A big reputation for a restaurant is never enough if the service is crappy. Not everything is worth it, there are a lot of good restaurants in Montreal...

We ordered duck meal... they should always tell us it is the hole duck! Unfortunately, they didn't and it only show their arrogance. We didn't sent anything back to the kitchen, but we were asked to leave the restaurant before we were done with food and wine... 800$ bills my friends! Basically, the manager kept repeating she was the manager at one inch of my face after a comment a made. I asked her to back off a bit, she really didn't appreciate it and took it personally and believe it was ok to ask customers to leave because of her own \"fit\" she was having. 

The rest of the staff looked pretty submissive, I bet with some good reasons."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is a great dining experience. The restaurant was not gimmicky at all after being featured by Tony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern's shows. 

The menu is in French and it's written compactly on a chalkboard on the wall in the middle of the restaurant. And, it's ok if you're not French savvy. Our waitress was really good at explaining all the dishes and recommended a tasting menu. She made sure my guests and I were ok with things like foie gras and horse tartare before deciding with the kitchen staff on what to serve.

For starters, we had the scallops and sea urchin. Both were yummy, but not a must-have. Next were the Mattones shrimps. Not your conventional shrimp cocktail. The shrimps are much smaller and sweeter and head intact and all. Very nice. Moved onto the horse tartare and it was served on a thick piece of country toast. It was good and not what I expected. 

Entree wise, we had the strip steak, lobster spaghetti, braised pork shoulder, and the breaded fish (whatever the catch of the day is). Lobster spaghetti was really good. Heavy cream sauce with the lobster pieces served and very nicely cooked al dente pastas and prosciutto/bacon bits. Steak was tender and cooked very nicely as well. Pork shoulder ok. Perfectly cooked, but it wasn't a show stopper for me. The fish dish was surprisingly good. Nicely breaded with panko and was really tasty.

The food is really good. Service is outstanding. The staff is professional, but warm and friendly. Their drinks and wine list looked amazing as well. We saw other people order the Bloody Mary and it was a gauntlet of proportions in a mason jar. They had two giant shrimps cocktails served with it just because why not? The food is on the pricier side, but I think it's well worth it. Portions are generous. And, overall...It's a really good dining experience.

Tip: for their seafood appetizers, the staff will bring out their signature hot sauce. It's really good! They sell it too and I was very disappointed to have forgotten to buy it before I left. It's similar to cocktail sauce, but better.

Also, make reservations online about two months in advance. The staff is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend from out of town and it was a great experience. We managed to find a table a couple of hours ahead and we were lucky. The waiter was super friendly and explained the entire menu and gave some recommendations too. Make sure you share some of their appetizers because their portions are huge, especially for the main dishes. The place was a bit tight, crowded and we were stuck in the corner by the door but overall a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Mon cher Joe.
Ton steak était délicieux.
Je crois que j'ai oublié mes invités pendant 15 minutes.
Mes yeux étaient fermé pendant que je dégustais ton steak.
Merci, c'était très bon et très cher.
Mais très bon."}
{"text":"I went to Joe Beef thanks to Anthony Bourdain. Four people with wine and appitizers we spent almost 500.00.  I wish I could say I liked it, but I can't.  The food was good, but not great....meh. I feel real foodies can go elsewhere and still feel 'hipster cool' while eating local farm raised food.

Also, our server (female and don't know her name) was really nice. We had a ton of questions and she took her time with us, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is a super popular spot well recommended by foodies around Canada! 
My husband and I decided to take a trip to the East part of Canada and were told  Joe Beef was a must! The gastropub has a very relaxed atmosphere, very casual, rustic look, tons of sea shells around with a super cute, flower filled terrace area. 
The menu is written on chalkboard and their wine menu is also written on a thin paper like notebook that is leather bound! Super original! Although everyone speaks English, the menu is mostly written in French, so having a bit of French food knowledge is definitely a plus. 
The food can be described as an explosion of flavored in your mouth! We started with 4 different varieties of oysters and  razor clams that were served with apple and foie gras shavings (combo totally works)! As main dishes we had the lobster salad and rump steak Reuben style (sorry don't remember the name). We were able to get a last minute reservations through our hotel so make a reservation in advance! We sat at the bar and the guys were extremely attentive, fun, and knowledgeable! 
Definitely great experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal I had in Montreal...and this is coming from a New Yorker who loves food and just came back from a Paris trip. The waitress guided us through the meal from beginning to end selecting the perfect wine to pair with the food, and she was never wrong. The appetizers are second to none: horse tartar (don't miss on ordering this life altering dish...ignore that it says \"horse\"), foie gras (rich and succulent), the smoke meat croquette (don't underestimate them) and last but not least half-dozen oysters which had the perfect balance between brine and lightness. 

For the main course we went for the classic lobster spaghetti (did not live up to the hype but still excellent) and finally the best dish of the night: \"pork happiness\" with a pork belly wrap-around with a side of bone marrow and escargot. 

For dessert we went for the hazelnut/chocolate cake and it was the perfect end to this once-in-lifetime experience. 

Our meal was bliss and any trip to Montreal without including Joe Beef...is just not complete. If you find a reservation, make yourself a favor and GO!"}
{"text":"C'est probablement le meilleur resto de Montreal! Et encore mieux, apres avoir goute a leur cuisine, vous pouvez la faire chez vous et impressioner vos invite!! Achetez absolument le livre! 5/5"}
{"text":"My rating is actually somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.

I recently visited Joe Beef on a Thursday night fresh off the train from Toronto. It was my first time there and I'd be very happy to go back to try them on another night.

Joe Beef is a Montreal mainstay and came highly recommended to me by, well, pretty much everybody. While the wine list and menu prices are at the higher end of Montreal's very accessible dining scene, the coziness of the room and the casual friendliness of the staff help stave off that sometimes uncomfortable fine dining feel that should really only be encountered in 3-star Michelin temples of haute cuisine (and hopeful aspirants).

(I say \"cozy\" but our table of three was perched in *almost* cramped quarters in the front window of the right-hand side room. I would have enjoyed slightly more space.)

The menu and the wine list are written on chalkboards; the menu can be seen in both rooms, but unfortunately the same isn't true of the wine list. I think that the menu really fits into the vibe of the establishment; they didn't have to do the same to the wine list - which really oughtn't change so often that it really makes sense to leave it impermanently scrawled on slate, especially given its extensiveness). I really do appreciate the opportunity to look through a wine list on my own, even with Joe Beef's attentive and knowledgeable staff happy to recommend what turned out to be a delicious bottle.

The food (the main event of the evening) is what actually disappointed (relative to my high high expectations). To start I had horse tartare, in this case  spread on toast and served with horseradish cream. Though there was nothing wrong with it, with the spicing on the tartare and the cream I didn't really have the opportunity to enjoy the main event (the meat), which was itself maybe overworked to the point that it wasn't necessarily recognizable as a former animal, either visually or on the palate. (This is perhaps what most diners prefer).

For my main I had the Lievre Royale, which is basically a forcemeat of hare (and in this case rabbit, I think) wrapped around foie gras, which Joe Beef then tops with a small slab of foie as well. It's served hot with a jus made with blood, foie, and truffles, and puree potatoes on the side. A beautiful, rich, and mouth-watering dish in my mind, but the kitchen's preparation of the that night was overseasoned to the point of saltiness. I kept having to go to the (rapidly disappearing) potatoes for relief, and couldn't really taste the delicate flavors. I ended up leaving a third of the meat on the plate, which made me a little sad. This is supposed to be a rich dish by all means, and I don't mean that it was too rich. It was salty.

For desserts, we had an over-the-top decadent pineapple concoction, and pistachio soft-serve on the side. Both were enjoyable and expressed the personality of the restaurant.

The closest comparison I can draw to Joe Beef's attitude towards food and dining has to be Au Pied de Cochon in the same city. Both have no time for pretense and prefer to reserve finesse for the preparation of their product, not its presentation to the diner. Both have cozy, noisy rooms filled with happy eaters. But the excessive, gluttonous meal I had at APDC some years ago was prepared perfectly; I couldn't stop eating through 3 dishes of animal fat served with animal fat and a syrupy, heavy dessert. At Joe Beef I had to stop eating, and not because I was full. I hope I just hit an off-night because this is a restaurant I ought to love, and which I'll definitely return to."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is definitely delicious, but a little steep for the end product. I ate there on a cold March evening, and it was filled to capacity. There is a good ambiance, and the staff works in sync.

The menu is written on the chalkboard behind the main seating area, as it changes frequently. The wine list is also featured on the board, with the cheapest beIng around $40/bottle.

We shared an appetizer, each had a main (lobster spaghetti & rabbit with foie gras) and we shared a dessert... save room for dessert, because ALL of them looked amazing and well-thought out.  For example, our \"baked potato\" consisted of meringue shaped like a potato with homemade orange ice cream as \"sour cream\", candied orange peel and almond \"bacon bits\" and burned caramel \"gravy.\"

The food was rich, just the right quantity, but about $15-$20 overpriced for the mains. 

I am glad we didn't drink, because with a shared app, two mains, a Coke, coffee and dessert, we were at $175 including tip. 

Watch your budget and treat yourself to Joe Beef some day."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the 5 star ratings are coming from. We got seated an hour after our reservation but that was OK because we got reservations that afternoon and they gave us a free glass of wine while we were waiting. However, once we were seated, our waitress implied that our food would be coming shortly. This was a surprise to us because we had not even ordered! Our waitress had ordered for us! We immediately said that we would like to choose our own meal. She ran to the kitchen to cancel what she ordered and then returned to take our order. After that, the service was a bit frosty. The food was only OK. Probably because we already had a bitter taste in our mouth from the strange service they think is \"hip\"."}
{"text":"We came here on Tuesday, unfortunately it is closed. But, when we entered in the restaurant, we stood for around two minutes, even the guys saw us, they did not say anything. We are very disappointed about their service. We think that we will not be back for the famous lobster spaghetti."}
{"text":"Really, really heavy food.  I like meat and they do it well but there is no balance to their meals.  An experience, undoubtably, but this place really comes across as a gimmick and not a restaurant run by professionals.  A salad on the menu would be nice.

That said, the service was spectacularly good."}
{"text":"I had an exceptional meal here. despite its global reputation, I came here with modest expectations, and I was blown away - Joe Beef is truly special. had the croquettes, foie gras with brioche, horse tartar, fries, and a pistachio paris brest, and everything was delicious. Anthony bourdain said Joe Beef is \"the place to be\" in montreal, and it's true."}
{"text":"This place rocks and is worth every cent! Best steak I've ever had and appetizers and dessert were phenomenal. Great wait staff that never shoved you out the door despite the fact that the place was booked solid. A MUST stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"Where should I start my review... appetizer of course. It was a good start, very good terrine called jambon persillé. This is it, that's the only positive thing I can say about the restaurant. The main course was chewy and overcooked. The waitress was a bit pushy and trying to sell us more food than we needed.

I would have given 3 stars if it wasn't that expensive but unfortunately this place is so overrated."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best dining experiences ever. Perfect balance of incredible ingredients, perfect preparation and impeccable service.

We made reservations several weeks in advance of arriving in town and within three bites of th3 apps we asked the host if it was possible to squeeze us in the very next night.

The second evening was just as perfect as the first."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I myself heard about Joe Beef, like many others, because of Tony Bourdain. Shoot me. I love just about everything about Montréal and I visit many, many times a year but I had never been THAT far down Rue Notre Dame. So, naturally, after watching the Québec episode of Parts Unknown, it was only natural to try it. I was, however, rather dissuaded by some of the negative reviews here. After all, just because it's on TV doesn't mean it's good. It could just be hype. But, after making reservations a good 2-3 months in advance, I decided to go for it.

And, let me tell you, I am glad I did because, from the ambiance to the waitstaff to the wine list to the food, Joe Beef provided me with the single best dining experience I have ever enjoyed. The waitresses were abundantly friendly, helpful, and attentive from the moment my girlfriend and I stepped in, even though we chose to operate \"en anglais.\" We started with a lovely Burgundy from the rather extensive, French-heavy wine list. And, while I'm not the kind of person that can thoughtlessly drop hundreds on a bottle of wine at a place like this, having recently been to a comparable French restaurant in New York City where even the Côtes du Rhônes were nearly $100, the Joe Beef wine list impressed me. For food we started with oysters and the lobster-pork sausage, both of which were great. And for the main course we split the Ribeye (20oz!) which was marvelous and described by the girlfriend as the best she's ever had. Indeed. For dessert we split the gâteau marjolaine and espresso, both of which were great. When it was all said and done, although we had had a rather early reservation, we emerged from Joe Beef nearly 3 hours after entering, something I've never before experienced. An older Italian gentleman proprietor of an old-school restaurant on the Emilia-Romagna episode of Tony's show, to paraphrase, talked about how he liked providing \"two hours of pure happiness\" in his establishment and, as far as I can tell, that is just about the perfect justification for dropping a lot of money at Joe Beef."}
{"text":"We had one of the most memorable meals at Joe Beef.  First of all, Reservation should be made way in advance.  We booked a bit too late, but was lucky to get bar seating.  Our waiter was super knowledgable about the menu, taste, preparation.  We ordered the Smoked Trout and Raw Oyster as our appetizer.  The trout was out of the wold!  For the main meal, my husband and I shared the Rabbit which was wrapped in bacon, smoked to just tender enough to stimulate every taste bud.  Then we ordered two desserts to complete our night.  I don't remember the names of the desserts.  The meal was just wonderful, not too salty, not too greasy, the flavor comes in layers.  We were left speechless."}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant in Montreal. 

Get the ribs and melt away in joy!"}
{"text":"I was able to land a reservation at the bar on the day of. If you are looking to land a table with a party of two or larger, it could be a little harder to get a spot in the restaurant. I called in around 5 PM and had a confirmation for 9:15.

I had a very pleasant experience, and ordered most of the mainstays. I have some dietary restrictions (no pork, no alcohol), and I was blown away by the staff's attention to my dietary restrictions. My past experience has been most fancy restaurants can only make food in a certain way and don't really allow for any customizations. The people at Joe Beef were not only okay with customizations but would openly warn me if any of the menu items had anything that doesn't comply with my needs.

I ordered a delicious asparagus dish that was doused in a white sauce that wasn't too creamy. I also had the beef tartare and half of the lobster spaghetti (without the bacon). For dessert, I had the marjorolie (sp?) slice. The lobster spaghetti was phenomenal, and the food presentation was exquisite. Beautiful dishes.

I also want to tip my cap to Gabriel, who was working behind the bar that night. Since I don't speak French, Gabriel deftly helped me through the menu last night. The first asparagus dish they sent out had ham in it, and he was very apologetic about sending it out. They quickly remedied it by sending out a dish without the ham -- I was very pleased with the level of service.

The only reason I docked a star was the length of time. I sat down at 9:15, and probably ordered by 9:25. I received my first dish by 10:15 (mind you the first dish had ham, so I had to return it), and was out of the restaurant by 11:15. I thought it could be a little faster."}
{"text":"Awesome food.

Go there with a open mind. Their menu varies daily. And it's an experience. The place is small and seating is limited. So u have to make reservation  weeks or even months ahead. 

Other than the seating.....I can't say anything negative. ...it's a must place to go.."}
{"text":"If you don't think this resto is the best you are a F-ing Idiot!  This Resto is better than the hype. They grow their own veggies, have a smoker and just added a fish holding pen. The food, vibe, and service is the best, if you can ask to sit on the outdoor terrace. 
Make a reservation and go and stuff food in your gullet until you cannot eat anymore. Roll home drunk and happy. Save money and go back again. Then go see your DR for Gaut  and it will be worth it because you will die happy. If you disagree with me you may be a douche who needs fancy table cloths, valet parking, and shiny clothing. If you are looking for a place that is fancy shmancy this is not your place. Just great food great vibes!"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Didn't look to great from the outside but once inside it was really cool.  Loved the oysters and sea urchin.  Had the trout and squab very good.  Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I can think of few spots in the world that left such a mark on me as Joe Beef. The decor, the wine, and most inportantly the food. This will stand as one of the best meals of my life without a doubt the best wine/ food pairing of my life."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is the type of place that already has its reputation established and no longer tries or cares. The food was good, but I've never had such slow and uninspired service, been given such infrequent and ungenuine attention, or felt such an uncaring and unwelcoming attitude from serving staff (particularly from our absolutely awful server, Patrick) at any restaurant in my life. This restaurant is far from one of the greats in Canada. It is a stronghold for pretention and bad attitudes directed towards those it considers unworthy. I am sorely disappointed with my experience here, and I strongly recommend against dining here to anyone who might be considering. Try any other high end restaurant in town that actually cares and puts effort in beyond just the food, and there are many: PDC, Toque, Bouillon Bilk to name a few. Really anywhere but here. In its current state and with service from staff with attitudes like Patrick, Joe Beef does not live up to its reputation whatsoever."}
{"text":"I've had one of the best and most memorable meals ever in this place. It's a tiny resto-pub located pretty far out of downtown montreal. 

Nevertheless, they really know their clientele and their menu is great. The Oysters are amazing, and my strongest recommendation. I've also enjoyed the huge portion of Lobster pasta and a beautiful dessert. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was so romantic its a great date spot away from traditional Montreal spots!"}
{"text":"Joe Beef's reputation stretches all the way to L.A., so when I found myself in Montreal, there was no way I wasn't going to find out what all the fuss is about.

We had been warned over and over again that getting into this place was akin to strolling into the Pentagon without clearance. But somehow, with enthusiasm and ambition, we were able to stroll into the Pentagon around 8:30p on a Saturday, and get seated right away.
We started with a dozen oysters, which were tasty and fresh. Ok, not the BEST oysters I've ever had (see my L'Orignal review), but solid.
Next, we ventured to the fresh burratta that was flown in from Italy that day. Prepared with carrots 4-ways, it was a very original twist on the traditional salad. Buttery and tangy, the cheese bounced nicely off the crispy, semi-sweet carrots. 
For our main courses, we split the Joe Beef Steak and the reconstructed lamb (I forget the Polish term used for this style of taking all the meet and arranging it around a bone). The steak was tasty, but nothing special. In fact, I only took about two bites of it before concentrating all of my attention on the lamb dish, which was phenomenal. The meat was tender and succulent, and the accompanying escargot and pieces of fried bacon, pearl onions and reduction sauce were pretty unforgettable. 
Heavy fare for sure, but so worth it.
The fries dusted with parmesan and the creamy polenta made for well-matched starchy sides to our very rich main courses. 

Everyone on the staff we interacted with, from the bartender to our waitress to our busser, was friendly and knowledgeable. It was very apparent that they're all proud of being part of this establishment. The fantastic service and the pleasant atmosphere of our garden-side table rounded out a really wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh, what an expensive disappointment. After having AMAZING meals at Bar Henrietta, Wilfrid, L'Express, Au Pied du Couchon, we thought we were saving the best for last. Instead, we were met with distracted servers, mediocre food, and an outrageous bill. While all the tables around us were laden with food, we waited at least an hour for our appetizers which were timed oddly and felt completely out of order. The server tried to pass the vichyssoise as a palate cleanser, but really, it meant they couldn't pour the weird fishy concoction into tiny bowls and get them out to the table any earlier. Meal went down hill from there. Worst part was a train wreck of meat and shellfish passed off as a signature dish. It's not easy to cook all these ingredients separately and boy did they miss the mark. Save your money and go somewhere were you'll be treated and fed well--there are too many places in Montreal to enjoy that far surpass this one."}
{"text":"We took a weekend out of NYC to find a place like this.  It has the rusticity and uniqueness of an April Bloomfield restaurant but the charm/essence of a restaurant deeply hidden in a perfect little town in Provence.  I was so charmed by smell, the ambience, my Chinon, and the epic service (friendly, warm, accommodating, witty), i basically handed my wallet to the waiter.  They change the menu daily so your waiter will tell you in epic but succinct detail what your mouth-watering options are.  The oysters and the urchin were a great place to begin, followed by a perfectly dressed green salad that was hopping off the plate with buoyant, fresh greens. Another glass of Chinon, and then we received a lobster spaghetti that had 1.25 lbs of lobster on it held together by bacon and creamy perfection, along with a grilled trout that was accompanied with beans and some kind of parsnip puree.   Whatever it was - it was perfect.
We finished off our meal with the cake - the cake was as good as the beginning and the middle of our dinner.  Steakhouse prices but it doesn't take away from the experience.  Pier and our waitress were A+."}
{"text":"Not so cozy and no menu, everything written down on a chalkboard.It wasn't easy to read the menu. However, I ordered the lobster spaghetti and I was in lover with it. A friend had a horse steak and another couple got jarret d'agneau. Huge portions. Food was great along with service. The restaurant is noisy and loud. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing...fun, tongue in cheek and loud....menus writtenin french on a chalkboard...waiters great to help if you need it...The menu is extensive and very meat oreinted...beef, lamb, pork, chicken...but great fish and oytsers...Food fun and with a twist..try the Double Down or the Pavlova...bathroom in front room is so fun....1/2 a bison in there!! Great wine list..great music...one of our best meals ever...will be back...
Great wine list....lovely cremant....good cocktails and apres dinner drinks...get the cookbook too!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with coworkers we all agreed that we liked the restaurant ambient, really good service and great food!! We ordered oysters for appetizer and homard lobster pasta which was little $$ but worthy. Great place."}
{"text":"Yes, you have to go. Yes, it will be memorable. They are irreverent, charming, hospitable, and they know their way around the kitchen. We had the double down (OMG), a rabbit dish, a pork chop, and cheese. The only disappointment was the Canadian pinot noir, but hey, it was Canandian wine. That's what we get for ordering it in the first place. The waitress decanted it for us, which improved it considerably. Our reso was at 9:45pm, and honestly, it was the perfect time. I don't think this place gets cranked up for a while. It was prime time to dive in by the time we arrived. I bought the vanity cookbook, which is hilarious. I may be enjoying it even more than my night at Joe Beef. The tables are tight: they have to pull it out for the inside person to be seated. We chatted with our neighbors, who were charming, but it woud've made for a miserable experience if they sucked because there's no escaping the people next door. 

All that said, I had a better experience for a slightly less pricey ticket at Au Pied de Cochon. Try to do both, but if you have to choose just one, I'd go with APDC."}
{"text":"We had one of the best meals of my life here. The foie gras parfait with pickled rhubarb and half roasted chicken with albufera sauce were knock-outs. Our server was welcoming and so excited about the food, which made ordering and chatting periodically a pleasure. She also helped us choose a wine in our price range that was special and to my taste, but stretched my wine experience. The marjolaine on the dessert menu is terrific and has apparently been on the menu for ten years. The spectacular food and convivial, no-pretense service makes this one of my favorite restaurant experiences."}
{"text":"Great dining experience!  Food was great, staff is knowledgeable, portions are generous!  Had the double-down foie-gras, deer and patate au four for dessert - each and every dish was delicious!  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Recommendations; foie gras, oysters, rabbit, suckling pig
Very nice atmosphere
Knowledgable and attentive service"}
{"text":"Most decadent, rich meal I have had in ages.

The other half & I were in town for Osheaga. Pretty much as soon as we decided to attend the festival, I made the reservation. Joe Beef has been on our list for ages.

Arrived at 9:30pm, seated promptly & ordered drinks. I had a Negroni, the other half had a cocktail that included bourbon & lemonade.

Our server was incredible, wish I remembered his name. We put our meal in his hands & had him put together a tasting menu for us.

First Course: Bone Marrow & Foie Gras with chicken wings: the bone marrow was roasted then the bone was hollowed out. Pâté made with marrow and Foie, then put back into the bone & served with chicken wings to dip. Rich, succulent, pretty incredible.

Second Course: Pappardelle pasta with smoky tomato (BBQish) sauce, bone marrow & ribs. Pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce had a great smoky flavor, ribs were fall-off-the-bone.

Third Course: Scallops & corn. Favorite dish of the night. 4 plump seared scallops over a bed of corn, lardons, greens & a corn based purée (I think). Loved it.

Fourth Course: Can't remember. Might or might not have something to do with all the booze that night.

Fifth Course: Horse Steak wrapped in bacon, cooked medium rare with about half an inch of herbed butter on top. Served with creamed greens, micro-green salad, more bone marrow & a massive side of incredible fries. We didn't come close to finishing this course. So much food.

As mentioned, service was very good, atmosphere great, amazing music, loud. 

Can't wait to go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I've read the cookbook, everyone and I know (including Anthony Bourdain) is goo goo gaga for this place, and I love hedonistic Quebecois cuisine as much as the next person, but seriously???  I don't get it.

Love Dave's perspective on things (particularly on the beverage program side of things), but the food is sloppily presented and just not that good.  When I read the menu off the blackboard I get super excited, but then it arrives and I eat it and I'm like \"Really? Should have gone to Hotel Herman... or shit, Schwartz's is better, haha\""}
{"text":"Disapointing, after all that hype... I had to book 3 months in advance!!!

The staff is wonderful, everyone was nice and very amiable, and they all seemed laid back and relaxed. Service here is good, except I don't rate on service just food.

I was hoping to try the foie gras burger, where the buns are fried foie gras slabs instead of bread, cuz you know I'm on a low carb diet lol but sadly it is no longer on the menu.

We ordered a half portion of the lobster pasta, which is one of the signature dishes here, the salade gourmande, the smoked duck and soft shell crab appetizer.

Of all the dishes, only the soft shell crab was really good, it was lightly battered and fried, serve on slices of zucchini with a nice vinaigrette. Light and fresh, crispy tempered with soft.

The lobster spaghetti was disappointing, it was super rich and yet bland. It could have used a little more salt or cheese. The shell was not exactly pre-cracked so it was a chore to get the flesh out. The portion was huge even for half portion, and the spaghetti was cooked al dente just right, when the dish got cold it wasn't soggy.

The salade gourmande was good, it had foie gras and terrine, boiled egg string beans and apple slices. Taste and textures were nice, the whole thing was topped with a few leafs of lettuce. We were warned that it wasn't really a salad, but it stood up to its name \"gourmande\" . It was pleasant but I felt like it needed a hint of sweet somewhere to balance out the the fat from the foie gras and terrine, a chutney or some glaze would have been nice.

The smoked duck had a very nice flavor but it was very dry. We had to dip it in the thick glazed sauce for every bite. In the end, we got this sauce overload after taste and it became very salty to finish. The roasted bulbs of shallots and mushroom were very tasty but did little to temper the salty sauce. I think roasted carrots or root vegetables would have been nice.

All in all, disapointing, what's all the hype about?"}
{"text":"I had a dozen oysters at the bar. For steak I enjoyed a bone in sirloin with a mushroom sauce that was nothing short of spectacular."}
{"text":"So much has been said already, and I agree with all of the positive points.  One recurring negative is the menu on the wall.  I can see how it is somewhat annoying, especially for those sitting right under it, being constantly crowded by other customers.  

The reason for the 4 star rating is directly related to the choices I made.  The double down foie gras was tasty but over the top rich with the deep frying and breading.  Then I had the bacon rib.  Delicious again, the veggies and apples went well with the dish.  The rib itself is a thick, bone-on slice of bacon slowly braised - addictively rich rich rich.  Tasted great!  Dessert, fantastic.

Coming back home, however, I could feel the fat, the richness rolling in my mouth (you know what I mean right?).  Somewhat unpleasant.  

The menu is full of dishes that are not as rich as what I sampled.  I will return and be more diligent in my selections not to exceed the over-richness threshold that even a few shots of grappa could not temper.  

David McMillan stopped by to say hi, that was neat!"}
{"text":"I love this place! 2nd visit with 5 friends so we knew we needed to get our favorites from the last trip again, and try something new. The menu only has a few things that never go away, the double-down being one of them. Deep fried foie gras, surrounding bacon, cheddar and mayo. To die for! But please share it or it may kill you. Standard suggestion is also the joe beef steak, I think it's 18 ounces, so either share or go there starving. We shared the horse tartar, found it to be a bit spicy, but the horse steak with a sausage was perfectly yum! Flavourful, tender...oh and if you're a seafood fan, have some oysters or the joe beef ceasar that comes loaded with goodies, an oyster, jumbo shrimp and a skewer of olives, onion and cornichon."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers' complaints about Joe Beef: 
Chalkboard Menu 
Wine List 
Prices 

My take on these: 
The chalkboard is charming and in French even! Tetes de violins are fiddleheads, don't you know? (Figured that one out myself!) 
The wine list-I don't care! I don't drink. Thank you Bill W. 
Prices. Are you kidding? My portion was ultra large. Well worth it. 

Now, to the meal. Our waiter brought out an amuse bouche of pork rillette and pickled vegetables. Very good and as far as amuses go, one of the largest servings ever. It could have been passed as an appetizer. 

We ordered appetizers of parfait of foie gras with plum jam and ricotta gnocchi with those fiddleheads and ham. Both were delicious. The gnocchi were so tender, the fiddleheads crunchy and the ham added the saltiness and flavored the sauce. The foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth good and very spreadable. It tasted great on the brioche it was served with along with the plum jam and a sprinkle of sea salt-like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for aristocrats. It's a good thing we had extra bread to mop up the gnocchi sauce and finish the foie gras.

The main course came-duck and lamb with seasonal vegetables and each meat was served in a sauce reduction. It was a fairly straight forward presentation. The plates were delicious. The meat was very tender. We weren't expecting sides to be served, but we got scalloped potatoes and root vegetables which made our ordering of asparagus seem like overkill. But, we happily ate it all and shared the beignets for dessert. 

The service at Joe Beef is fabulous. The wait staff was very attentive (and cute), filling water at the right time, clearing plates and seeing to our well-being. Our waiter was very well versed in understanding the menu in two languages. 

I say hooray for Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourites in Montreal. Joe Beef is able to blend a cozy atmosphere with extraordinary food. It's a little cheaper then it's close sibling, Garde Manger, in the part of town that I prefer. The staff is always inviting and will take the time to help if needed.

The food is out of this world. I've been a few times and I'm always amazed. If you enjoy a mix of rugged meat with refined toppings, you'll love what they have to offer. 

Soon they will be expanding so more people can go through the Joe Beef experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing french food, wine, service, atmosphere. It's world class."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service by Sarah! We started off with croquetas di smoked meat & aspergas vertes and blanches, oeuf di cane with hollandaise. Then, my husband has the strip steak (Monsieur Beaujeu) & I had the Spaghetti Homemade Lobster. Everything was absolutely perfect, mouthwatering, and fantastic! The food was on point and Sarah provided us with stellar service. Book your reservations in advance. They begin in advance up to 3 months and go quickly. They opened at 1800 hrs and there was a line waiting at the door, in the rain, when we arrived."}
{"text":"I went to Joe Beef for my birthday and what an amazing experience. The restaurant inside is cozy and has a wonderful ambiance. Make sure you reserve at least a month in advance ~ otherwise you might have a difficult time finding a spot. It's definitely on the pricier side of Montreal restaurants but worth ever penny. I had the lobster pasta, and my boyfriend had horse meat. The pasta was very yummy and creamy with huge pieces of lobster. Personally horse meat isn't for me but I imagine if it was, it the best place in town to eat it."}
{"text":"I want to give this between 3-4 stars

Everyone told me that \"we had to go\" - admittedly, I was very excited, I had read the cookbook and seen the wonderful pictures of the food.

But to be honest, I was not blown away.  The oysters were delightful - done escargot style and we had the fried foie gras - which was silly and too rich and the cote de bouef which was fantastic but HUGE. But I guess I was expecting a more french touch - subtler, nuanced flavors.  I was v happy that I went - and nothing was wrong with the food - just not a must have.  Nothing that any decent restaurant in Brooklyn isnt doing."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm not a foodie.  I'm a lady who likes great comfort food and fair prices.  DON'T go here if you are like me.  First two positives: this place is very cute inside and the staff is great.  

Negatives:
- menu constantly changes, so if you liked a dish in the past or were recommended a dish on Yelp, odds are that it is not present
- the menu is on a chalkboard (due to the menu turnover), very awkward to read it standing around other diners
- the menu seems very French and experimental, the chef may be the French-Canadian version of Gordon Ramsey.  This is great for diners who are wealthy and can experiment with odd food combinations
- VERY expensive, dinner for two with wine will run you around $135."}
{"text":"This isn't just a dinner, this is an experience. If you are wanting quick service in and out type experience this restaurant is not for you. This is the type of restaurant where you spend an evening. First off I have to say there are few restaurants with a better staff. We are American and speak absolutely 0 French and the staff were as patient and helpful as they could ever be. Literally translated the entire menu to us. Cool aspect regarding the menu. It is written on a big chalk board up on the wall. Kudos to that, I have never seen that before. The food was superb. We had an amazing shellfish starter with great appetizers sandwiched in between a mix of rabbit, duck, quail, and salmon. Finished with dessert and some coffee. 3 hours later I am a better human being for enjoying this great meal. Couldn't recommend this place more. 5 stars in every aspect. Bravo."}
{"text":"Food ? Top Marks.
Pretense ? 10 out of 10!!

First we were shown to the blackboard menu on the wall (they do not give you a printed menu), so you have to stand, with other diners, in a cramped dining room, and decide on your meal & wine, while standing over other diners (I later experienced this, with people standing behind me throughout my meal, bit weird).

First issue, most things are spelt in French, second issue, a lot of things lack decent descriptions, so if you have a question, you have to wait standing and ask a server.
The wines are very overpriced too.

Next major issue, they have cramped the tables in so close that they have to slide the thing out from the wall so you can sit down and you have to get their attention to do this every time you want to use the restroom. Crazy carry on.  You are way too close to the strangers either side. 
The food is excellent but everything else takes away from it.

I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Joe Beef has the buzz, and it lives up to expectations. We were greeted at the door and asked to review the chalkboard menu prior to sitting. The menu was a lot to take in all at once, but our waiter was helpful in navigating our order.
We immediately struck up a conversation with the friendly Montreallers sitting at the next table. They were there for the first time after hearing so much good from their friends.
My beef, no surprise at Joe Beef, was excellent with a spicy creamy sauce and the cheese on top was divine. The atmosphere is very relaxed and convivial. All together a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Every single bite was extraordinary, and I say that without exaggeration. Simply the best meal I have had in Montreal.  2 of us ordered 3 small plates and 2 deserts and everything blew our minds. The menu changes so just do what we did and have the (incredibly kind and helpful) server make recommendations. And when the weather is nice, you might get lucky and get a table outside in their amazing terrace surrounded by their vegetable garden. Super cool!"}
{"text":"One of our foodie acquitenances- Peter Meehan - said this was one of the best restaurants that he has been to in the world.  So even though we read that it was overpriced, we decided to give it a chance.  The ambience is cute - very typical LES restaurant with menu on the chalkboard, hipster servers, casual seating.  There were about 15 starters and 15 mains, plus a lot of it was in French, so we didn't know what to order.  Our server made some recommendations, but nothing really seemed that amazing, so we decided to go on our own.  We ordered:
- foie gras terraine with toast - we are in French territory after all so we had to have some foie gras.  It was actually pretty eh.  The foie gras was very fresh and clean tasting, but the toast was just a piece of bread, not French bread or even toasted.  There was a raspberry/Dijon jam on top, but it wasn't sweet enough.  Would not order this again
- corn flake eel nuggets - this sounded pretty interesting, but it actually turned out to sound better than it tasted.  It's basically round breaded nuggets with little bits of smoked eel.
- oysters - Not very frenchy but I really wanted some.  These turned out to be one of the best dishes, though.  SUPER fresh and delicious. 
- Spaghetti with lobster - I really wanted to eat this, but it sounds so typical so we went back and forth on whether to order it.  The server said it was their classic and always on the menu, so we decided to get it.  It was about a pound of fresh lobster with spaghetti and red sauce.  Very fresh and cooked to perfection, but it was very \"typical\" and I wish in hindsight that I had something more unique.

Summary: I would not recommend this place, not because the food is bad but because I think there's better for better value.  there really wasn't anything exceptional about the place, and I don't think the prices justified the outcome."}

{"text":"Food 5 / 5 decor 5 / 5 service 5 / 5 

We were 4, made reservations 2 months prior. Everything about the experience was perfection, one of the best part of joe beef is that you get top notch quality without the snootiness. You can get there in a suit, or in sweats, it won't matter because everyone is there for one reason: hearty, meaty, and delicious cuisine du terroir. The staff knows the food inside out as if they've cooked everything themselves.

1. Smoked trout 26$
2. Duck terrine 17$
3. Large pulled pork with butternut squash gnocchis (regular 27$ large 40.50$) 
4. Roasted Fowl 66$
5. Side of bone marrow 16$
6. Order of fries with parmesan flakes 8$
7. Pear pie with housemade Pear and clove ice cream 16$
+ 2 bottles of wine (white 65$ and red 65$)
+ 3 coffees (3$ each)

Everything above was shared. With tax and a 15% tip our total was 435$. For me, the pulled pork stole the show,  it's as if the meat just melted in your mouth, it was so tender. And the ice cream I would buy by the gallon if I could."}

{"text":"So excited to try and know so many people who love it. Went for dinner with new people we were entertaining for work,  one was from Quebec City and he was excited too. Wowowow,  this place does not live up to its hype AT ALL. We tried 8 different dishes among us and 6/8 were waaay too salty. I couldn't even finish my main which was deer in puff pastry. No one finished their food in our group. I eat out a decent amount and this is one of two restos I will never return to due to over-salting their food. Service was good, nothing special. As for not being able to recommend cause the menu is made the day of, that is BS. Many places of the same caliber have their wait staff taste the menu and learn it before shift starts. And seeing as how the same entrees keep being talked about on yelp, they most certainly can recommend something. Our meal was paid for but prices are just a bit higher than many restaurants in Montreal but not bad. Truly overrated. Go anywhere else on the same street for better."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food was excellent service was good! Def recommended if your in the area!"}

Two courses and two drinks for two people was $120 before tip and a  great experience."}

{"text":"I'll make this brief - the food is indeed incredible (see below), but this gets 3 / 5 stars because of this restaurant's terribly inconvenient approach to presenting its menu to customers.   

Let me make it clear - (a) the menu is written only in small print, 6-8 feet high, on a massive chalkboard in a dark room and (b) it is written entirely in French.   I am all for rolling with the punches in unique restaurants, and I've enjoyed many a fine meal in places with an unconventional approach.  But seriously, in a place where a generous dinner for two can exceed $300 with wine, I want - I NEED - to sit back, leisurely review a food/drink menu, and get excited about what is on order.   I'm terribly sorry, but forcing your customers to hastily try to interpret a large menu between walking in the door and sitting at your table is simply not acceptable when you are dealing in food and price points at this standard.  I don't need a fancy/branded menu engraved in leather - I need something I can sit and read without craning my neck and squinting my eyes, with at least English hints as to what the items are.   Even the best restaurants in Paris and Tokyo offer abridged English menus - Joe Beef, get over yourself.  How much/how long would it really take to whip off 20 menus on an Inkjet before the evening begins?  Don't put the onus on me to foolishly take a picture with an iphone or hope that the server is feeling generous enough to be overly helpful (which ours definitely was not).

Seems like a minor thing to worry about, but the frustration I felt from this problem dominated and threatened to ruin my night.  But thankfully, the food and the food alone saved the day - it was absolutely delicious, approaching perfect, and I would return for it.   My date and I shared 12 of the most amazing oysters I've ever had, a fois gras double down, fried egg with morels, lobster spaghetti, and a cheese plate.   Who knows what other secrets the menu holds...."}
{"text":"We had a truly memorable experience at Joe Beef, one of the best meals I have ever had.  Larry who greeted us, our server Sam, and the bartender Sarah, took exceptional care of us at our table in the garden amongst the herbs and veggies.  

The menu changes frequently, so I will not tempt you with specific plate descriptions, but we had a selection of original, unpretentious, peak-of-season farm-to-table dishes that seemed simultaneously effortless and ingenious.  The cocktails were on point, and we enjoyed an unusual but wonderful bottle of Chardonnay from Jura at Sam's recommendation.  

There is a reason David Chang (of Momofuku, et al) called Joe Beef his favorite restaurant in the the world."}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Montreal.  Everything was fantastic.  We had reservations for 9:30 (a must as the place is small and packed).  Our table of 4 got a great table in the back, ordered some amazing wine off the caulk board, the proceeded to dinner. 

Appetizers - Fresh tomato salad, rabbit ravioli and veal tartar - all of them winners

Entrées - Cheval (Horse), Joe Beef Steak and two orders of sucking pig.  I must comment on the Cheval as it was the first time I have had it.  It was a wonderfully prepared dish, a medium rare, bacon wrapped fillet, topped with blue cheese, anchovies and some other stuff.  The flavors and textures were spot on - highly recommend!

Dessert - they brought us complimentary Cognac shots

Staff - all extremely helpful and courteous.

Overall - make a reservation and spend a couple hours enjoying this great place"}

How many places offer a garden salad where the ingredients are selected from the restaurant's backyard garden? Amazing salad. I ordered the Lobster spaghetti and it was excellent!

We started off sharing a dozen oysters that were totally fresh and tasty. We each then had a house salad that did not disappoint. For my entree I had the Lobster Spaghetti - super delicious.  My friend had lobster sausages that he loved. People around us at the bar were all upbeat.  It was all fun!  One more thing... I inadvertently left my mobile phone at the bar and the bartender had the wherewithal to find my friend's cell number on my phone and call to alert us about my mistake.  Over the years we've tried out a lot of restaurants in Montreal. Joe Beef's is now right up there at the top."}
{"text":"Food - 3.5 stars
Service - 1 stars
Ambiance - 3 stars

To me, this looks like a restaurant that used to be great but they're now being complacent and relying on their reputation a little too much.

While I have no complaints about the food, I am expecting service to be a little better from a restaurant of this stature. The waiters were somewhat slow to come take our orders and never really checked on us during the dinner. They also forgot one of our appetizers. On top of that, we ordered the lobster spaghetti with bacon and it came without. Too many mistakes for a restaurant of this quality. 

Food-wise, I shared the joe beef steak and the lobster spaghetti and I thought both were very tasty. If I'd have to pick between the 2, I think Id go with their lobster spaghetti. 

The Bloody Caesar are very good but they are a bit on the pricey side (16$).

I also liked the vibe of this restaurant. We sat outside on the patio overlooking the impressively large vegetable garden."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the night we visited Joe Beef, it did not live up to the hype.

The menu was creative but when it came to execution, the chef seemed to phone it in.

The good news: We thought that the staff was incredibly attentive, the bloody Caesar with gin was amazing, the foie gras parfait with hot cross buns was mind blowing, and we enjoyed the classic country music.

The bad news: we did not enjoy the old fashioned cocktail which seemed to be measured with a thimble, the head cheese had too much gristle, the ox tail ragù pappardelle was not seasoned properly, and the mixed lamb grill was too raw.

Also, never underestimate how a romantic evening can be ruined by a screaming infant seated at the table next to you. The restaurant staff tried to compensate by turning the music up louder. By the end of the evening, we skipped dessert altogether and went back to the hotel disappointed and $250 poorer.

Perhaps the chef was having an off night because the Montreal Canadiens were playing (they had the match on TV in the restaurant). This is unfortunate because we had traveled for over 3 hours, booked 2 months in advance, and we were hoping to have a special night. I don't think we will be back.

However, we will go back to Liverpool House! The difference in quality was night and day!"}
{"text":"fun, adventurous, delicious food. cool atmosphere. the mad geniuses behind joe beef are the epitome of canadian cool. go."}
{"text":"I agree with Amber... I was there on Friday night (Feb 19) and despite the food being tasty, the prices no way near proportional to how tasty.  Also, it is incredibly annoying to have to read an entire food and wine menu while standing up in a narrow passage-way.  It makes it very difficult to discuss with your dining companion what to share/have (which is usually an enjoyable process).  I had to keep getting up to see the menu to remember what went with what.  Also, with 2 main dishes included a $49 steak, one might expect more sides than some lonely green beans.  

But my biggest disappointment with this restaurant was being lied to in the worst case scenario, or fobbed off in the best.  I asked our waitress if the skate was a sustainable fish and she said \"oh yes,  there are so many of them, they need to get rid of them.\" with an air of confidence which made it seem as if she knew what she was talking about.  This is completely false.  According to this website, http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=147, \"Skates have been severely overfished and most are caught with bottom trawls, which result in high levels of accidental catch and substantial damage to the seafloor.\" If she did not know the status of sustainability of this fish, I would have preferred she say she didn't know or ask the chef.  If she had done so, I would not have ordered this dish.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"As an appetizer, we ordered the foie gras parfait which was amazing! The foie gras so smooth and creamy. For the main course, we ordered the duck dish and lobster spaghetti. I am not a huge fan of lobster but the sauce was creamy and the lobster was delicious! The duck dish was by far one of the best dishes I've ever had. It was perfectly cooked, almost melted in your mouth and the sauce really complimented it. There was also a bit of foie gras on top and little fried mashed potato like things on the side. I would highly recommend it. To drink, I told the waiter that I wanted something with gin and a little bit fruity. They were able to come up with a drink that was not on the menu and was delicious! It had an herby, sweet taste and complimented my meal. 

The service was amazing. The staff was polite and offered to explain all of the menu in English. We went on a Wednesday night around 8:30 pm and it wasn't too packed. If you are in town and don't have a reservation, I would suggest checking early in the day through the app \"Dinr\", they list this app on their website for same day reservations and it is great! Overall, it was a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"No too good. We came and had to wait for our table which is fine. Then we had 2 drinks before we could finally get 1 appetizer for my boyfriend, I had to wait for another  30 Min to get mine. 45 min later still no sign of our main course. 1 hour later I asked our waitress if everyone is okay with our order she stated \"of course Madame\" we waited another 10 min. Here it is undercooked salmon and over papered steak. Couldn't  wait to get out but it took our waitress another 30 min to check on us. We definitely will not come back!!!"}
{"text":"I went back and got the lobster spaghetti.  So darn good, worth all 10000 calories."}
{"text":"I think the best food I've had in a long time...perhaps ever! I planned a trip to Montreal just for Joe Beef but hadn't made reservations in advance. I was so lucky to sneak in at 9:30 on a Saturday night for dinner, and am so happy that I did!

The food was the best I've eaten in...since I can remember! I chose the cheval with fries and a cress salad and my friend had the pork schnitzel. Both were so much better than I thought they could be! We also shared the beer cheese....fantastic!

The staff was all friendly, helpful and warm. I felt like I could (and should) have spent all night there! 

Though I did spend a lot of time twisted around trying to read the menu (which is only written on a chalk board...nothing to read at the table!) I think that we chose the perfect wine for our meal. The list was HUGE and I doubt that anything on the menu was bad. 

Overall, the most happy and comfortable place I've eaten in to date. These folks really understand what is important about food. I wish I lived closer so that I could eat here more often...then of course, my pants might be happy that I don't!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic.

Although I don't like fois gras, I ordered a 1/2 order of the \"double down\". Big mistake, I should have ordered the full portion. It was the best thing I've ever eaten! It's had the perfect balance of light crunch and melt-in-your-mouth sweet goodness. Every bite was better than the last. By the time I finished it, I had a food high I rarely get, and I couldn't stop bragging to my wife that I made the best ordering decision for appetizers. For our main, we ordered a special for two, neck of lamb. When it arrived at our table, I imagined how I would feel after dinner, it was a lot of meat! It was also probably the best Lamb ever. No meat hangover either!

If I had to point out any weakness, I might say it's that the menu is located solely on a wall chalkboard, which although the staff was happy to take the time to explain preparations, I felt a little awkward standing in the middle of the small dining room trying to decide what to order - although others were doing the same.

I also imagined we'd be packed in like sardines. Definitely not the case, nice space between tables.

If at first you don't succeed in getting a reservation, try try again. We got lucky the day of, you might too."}

{"text":"From my review on Food Network Canada.. \"Joe Beef: Discovering Montreal's Eclectic Food Culture\" Google that if you want to see the full post. 

Montreal is quickly becoming known for its vibrant food scene as Quebec's distinct local culture is being celebrated throughout its many eateries. Living and eating well are paramount there and often a meal in Montreal becomes a feast. The culinary heritage has its roots in France of course,  but with the benefit of a uniquely Canadian influence, dining out in Montreal can be truly magical.

One of the most celebrated restaurants in Canada is Joe Beef. Taking its namesake from an irish-born 19th century tavern owner who catered to the working class and the down and out.  The Joe Beef of yesteryear served labourers, beggers, longshoremen, sailors and ex army men with easy service and most surprisingly, \"a menagerie of wild animals.\" Joe Beef current day is a massively popular restaurant serving whimsical French market cuisine to locals and vistors alike in the not-so-quickly gentrifying neighborhood of Little Burgundy. The animals are gone, for the most part (the washroom boasts a bison...).

Since 2005, Owners Frédéric Morin, David McMillan and Allison Cunningham, have transformed a small street just north of the Saint Lawrence into a bonafide culinary destination. Joe Beef is well regarded, popular, and often fully booked.  In order to keep up with the influx of diners, The Joe Beef team opened Liverpool House (a tavern) and McKiernan (a luncheonette since closed) within the same block.

 A mid-autumn road trip to Montreal called for some quality cuisine and I was lucky enough to score reservations for Joe Beef. I could not have been more excited.

If Joe Beef has anything, it's personality. The decor is eclectic, in a 'found-and-meaningful objects' way. The walls are lined with wainscotting, subway tiles and a hodge-podge of collectibles and old maps. Chalkboard menus spell out the evening's offerings, changing weekly and featuring five or six new dishes at a time.  Renowned for a number of things, (rustic decor, oysters placed on inedible objects, liberal use of foie and seasonal ingredients) the Joe Beef kitchen creates whimsical dishes with intense flavour. 

 We were seated at a table on the heated back patio overlooking the impressive garden. A Series of raised planters and garden beds provide fresh vegetables and herbs for the kitchen. A DIY smoker in the backyard allows the chef to serve home made, house smoked, homegrown and thoughtful dishes with an artisan approach.  Joe Beef is all about the locally sourced and seasonal and having relationships with the purveyors, as well as top notch hospitality.

Unassuming, cabin-life decor, comfortable with decedent eats; Joe Beef is on any gourmands must-dine list, and is a  true testament to the spirit of Montreal."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be the next phone call after a cancellation for a group of five at 9:30 on a Saturday. This was like hitting the lottery so plan ahead and get reservations early because this place is worth it.  My friend and I all split appetizers and the smoked croquettes were a hit. We also had Moishes pickles (which are great) and a few other delicious appetizers.  I had a ribeye and two of my friends had the ambassador.  They were good aged steaks but I have to say the meal of the night was the spaghetti lobster. It's enough for two but our friend at the whole thing because it was amazing. If I ever return (and I'm thinking about it now) I will have the that meal (spaghetti lobster) along with as many appetizers as possible."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The evening started out with a bit of a wait because of other guests lingering. Wasn't a big deal but the host did bring us each a glass of a wonderful white wine to tide us over. That gesture pretty much set the tone for the rest of the night. Service was wonderful and the food was delicious. We had the eel and croquettes de smoked meat for appetizers and the lobster sausage for two as our main.  All highly recommended. Looking forward to our next visit. A shout out to the staff for a memorable dinner."}
{"text":"Called Saturday afternoon and they had a cancellation so got in for 7pm supper. Husband ordered gnocchi with mushrooms to start, beef short ribs with escargot as a main and bread pudding for dessert. I had smorgasbord to start, followed by a HUGE pork chop (I only ate about a third of it) and Greek yoghurt with honey and fruit. 

Apps were amazing. Mains solid and tasty. Desserts yummy. Will definitely return on future trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"Thanks to Anthony Bourdains show \"The Layover.  We found out about this place when we visited montreal.  We hopped on the subway in downtown montreal and got off just blocks from the restaurant.  We made reservations for 9:30 and showed up at 8:30 and we were immediately seated.  

The only thing I did not like about this place was the only written menu is written on the wall in chalk and we were at a table where we had to get up and look and then I took a picture with my phone.  The waiter was great and was able to help us translate the menu since my girlfriend and myself know zero French.  Also give us great recommendations.

 The food itself was delicious.  Oysters were sweet.  Foie gras
Double down was perfection in my mouth.  For entrees my girlfriend had a horse filet mignon wrapped in thick bacon which was cooked perfectly.  I myself had the duck which was the best duck I have ever had.  Great meal!  Will def be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The space is so welcoming and warm. The service was spot on... always there when you needed something but never intrusive. The team was friendly and they genuinely seemed to be enjoying the company of their guests. The menu was diverse enough to make the decisions a little tough but ultimately any choice would have been the right one. The food was delicious! Prepared with expertise, beautifully presented with being pretentious and the balance of flavors/textures were perfection. Highly recommend Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"What didn't happen at Joe Beef.

Up to Montreal from NYC for a celebration with 9 friends.  Had 2 reservations.  One for 6 pp and one for 4 pp.  Two dropped out, so I called to change the 6 top to 4.  The staff refused to sit the 8 of us together, much less in the same room.

I was told this was resto policy.  I acknowledged and asked for an exception, to try their best.  

We sat down at 9 pm.  Beside us stood a 4 top empty for over 45 minutes.  Bar had 8 empty seats as well.  My friends had a 9:30 pm resy, but since we arrived together, I asked for us to be seated together.

Server told me flat out that they \"never\" do that for anyone.  Eventually (9:45 pm) a 2 top was seated beside us.  My friends were seated in a completely different room.  

Server kept asking how things were.

How do you think things were?

We didn't travel all the way to Montreal to be separated.

I am a chef and own a restaurant in NYC.  It is small and I have to play table tetris to accommodate my customers too.  Even if I can't honor an initial request, throughout the dinner service I make it work.  When possible I move them to their desired table.

We all ordered plenty of wine and food (even though they are listed on blackboards that no one can read), so much so that we were the last tables in the resto.  Do you think at some point they could have combined us so we could finish our wine together or at least share dessert?  \"NEVER\"

What didn't happen at Joe Beef?  HOSPITALITY

The food was hit or miss.  Cold foie gras appetizer was one note.  Squash flowers was over fried with too much batter. Rabbit was overcooked.  Better duck in chinatown back home.  Spaghetti with lobster a winner.  The menu is too ambitious for this gastro pub to execute.  Good wine list. I skipped dessert. 

I can forgive inconsistent food if the hospitality is there.  

Joe Beef is a gastro pub masquerading as a full service restaurant.

I have read this is part of the restaurant credo.  Take it or leave it.  And some customers enjoy being treated like their patronage doesn't matter.  Good for them and good for you.  This restaurant is review proof and people will continue to fill the seats.

But you know what happened at Au Pied du Cochon, Salmigondis, Le Fantome, Magpie and even Trou de Beigne, a donut shop? 

Hospitality

I received better treatment at Tim Horton's.

Forget that in my party were various industry people who have traveled and dined all over the globe.  Forget that we were there to have a good time.  This isn't about a spoiled American always getting his way.  I know how hard it is to accommodate requests.  But I try.  I put in the effort. At some point during the evening I make something happen.  We didn't need a dessert comp or an extra dish.  We just wanted plain old fashioned hospitality.

People visit my restaurant and often ask me for recommendations for NYC and other cities I have visited.  Top of the list as one of the worst dining experiences of my life.

Good luck to you Joe Beef.  

Make all the money in the world treating your customers like they don't really matter.

Buyer Beware."}
{"text":"Thank you Gilbert for getting us this last minute reservation!  Another fellow reviewer summed this place up perfectly...F'ing ridiculous!  First, the wrong thing to do is to order two (yes two) double downs to start the meal...ugh!  They were good, but it ruined me for the rest of the meal.  The eel nuggets were ok, but not bad.  The duck eggs were just sunny side fried with a hash brown side and truffle on top.  Yes, the chalkboard menu was hard to read, but the atmosphere was interesting, our waiter was personable, our very close table mates, who we chatted with throughout the meal with Allison and Greg trying to figure out what the menu said.  And the bacon wrapped cheval...well, let's just say mommy will not be telling the kids about that dish..."}
{"text":"I came for my bday after hearing many great reviews and all I have to say is WOW!!!  From the oysters, horse tartar, the ribeye, etc. Joe Beef definitely is the best restaurant in Canada."}
{"text":"Tasty, out of the ordinary, french-american fusion."}
{"text":"I had great expectations for Joe Beef because it took us two months to score dinner reservations. The ambiance is a very intimate setting. It's like walking into a bed and breakfast kitchen diner. Everyone is squeezed in together tightly.  The host takes your coats and hangs it up and we sat in a small booth for five. Dinner menu was written on a chalkboard wall that was barely legible. 

Our waitress was easy on the eye. She was beautiful so when she informed us we only had two hours for drinks, appetizer, dinner and deserts we all just agreed to the rules and nodded our heads. Two hours later on the dot. We empty out our purses and wallets and walked out of the restaurant happy and full."}
{"text":"Our dining experience here felt like we were invited to hang out at a very cool friend's very cool house with very delicious food. In spite of its ridiculously long wait-time to snag a reservation, the place is far from pretentious and the service was casual and warm.

Our table wasn't quite ready when we walked in so we were invited to sit at the bar where the host poured us wine and made small talk, modestly downplaying the success of the restaurant, giving huge props to the great kitchen staff and talking about the various dishes on the menu as though they were children he could never be forced to choose between. 

Every detail of the decor feels random and perfectly kitsch-y but expertly placed; from the makeshift library of cookbooks near the bar to the giant gallon of gin and six pack of bitters above our table.  The music was equally eclectic - from Dolly Parton to rap in one sitting!

My only pet peeve is chalkboard menus which force you to squint and invade other diners' personal space...but its a necessary evil of fresh cuisine. 

The menu was seafood heavy on our visit; as a meat eater I asked our host for a suggestion and was directed to the \"chou-croute\"  which was a huge pot of sausage and cabbage with potatoes and a rich broth....impossible to finish but delicious!

Our waitress, Samia, was fantastic. Sensing how full we were after dinner she brought us a serving of their home-made ice cream - a light concoction of rum and pineapple and all manner of goodness - and chatted with us like an old friend. 

The prices were more than reasonable - an entree, main, glass of wine and tea came in at under $60. 

Definitely worth the wait for a reservation!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant ever! Service was awful. The waiter forgot to put in out entree order which resulted in us waiting two hours for a piece of fish. We were there two and a half hours and didn't even order dessert. The waiter said he would comp part of our bill but conveniently forgot when the bill came. I reminded hi and he comped two glasses of wine only.

The place was hot and loud and crowded. The menu was entirely in French with no translations.the food was good but not great, and the fish had bones in it when it arrived. Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Never before have I been so happy from a baked potato that I shed a single manly tear. And I guess booking months in advance helped us to get the romantic seat by the window. 
This is one of the best places I have ever had the privilege of eating in. Our waiter Patrick was very accommodating as me and my lady barely speak any French. His suggestions were phenomenal and his service was superb, as well as the chemistry between all the employees. A very friendly and cool environment. 
We started with the caviar dish that came with minced onions, egg whites and egg yolks, sour cream and these teeny tiny pancakes. ULTRA NOM because holy shit was that good. I'm Jewish, potato pancakes an caviar with sour cream are my life and no one makes them better than my mother. So sorry mom but now I want this dish every Hanukkah. 
I got the steak and potato. The steak was just... Ugh. Perfection. I felt like a white teenage girl who just passed Justin Beiber... With every bite! And the potato topped with bacon, mushrooms and escargot made me want to blubber like an infant. 
She got the lobster spaghetti, which was very good, but we both thought my steak was better, especially when dipped in her lobster sauce (thanks again to Patrick for the suggestion). I am a huge fan of lobster though and adored her dish. 
One bottle of wine and several shots of moonshine later, we were ready for desert (can you believe we are average weight and height? I know we sound like gluttons... We are). Triple vanilla ice cream on top of pear sorbet and topped with melted chocolate. By this point, we were stuffed, but the dessert was so crazy good that we got it down to the halfway mark before listening to our rational side and stopping. 
I've never had a meal or dining experience quite like Joe Beef before and I doubt I'll ever have anything like it again (New York City service is shit compared to the kindness of Montrealers). 
Thank you Joe Beef. Thank you Patrick for being our demigod for our time spent in your glorious house of gastronomical worship. Thank you for making a grown man nearly cry over the joy-infused baked potato."}
{"text":"JOE BEEF.....Joe Beef is one of my favorite restaurants in N America, not just Montreal.  I could write about the food, which is great, but I would like to write about the staff....they create a vibe which I really love.  I live in NY and I always keep thinking how many times a month would I be at JB if it was here.  But, I don;t think it would be the same.  Joe Beef captures so many of the great things about Montreal. The laid back, really easy vibe, great food and NOT a scene.  That I think is the best part.  Everyone there (staff included) seems to really want to be there.  Not \"thinks\" they should be there. I think all of that comes from the top.  If you get the Joe Beef cookbook you can feel the energy in the book."}
{"text":"After hearing loads about Joe Beef and making a reservation ahead of a trip up to Montreal, I reeeally wanted to LOVE this place. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe it was just an off night, but the lobster spaghetti was good, not great. Overly rich, yet lacking in the breadth of flavor we had expected. Maybe it was the overpowering amount of tarragon or savory that I thought I tasted, but it just didn't do it for my fellow diners and me. The ribeye steak (which the waiter took it upon himself to order for us, rather than the horse tartare we had  actually ordered) was decent, but with the generous layers of fat, large slab of blue cheese on top, and foie gras mousse rubbed all over, a bit too insane. Clearly, covering anything with a bunch of fat will enhance the richness, but after awhile, it becomes kinda boring. 
On the other hand, the foie gras mousse with brioche was excellent in a small dose and the pickled ramps that went with it were the perfect chaser. The oysters were fresh and briny. The garden salad, which had supposedly come from the Joe Beef garden, was light and crispy - just right after the heavier part of the meal. Dessert was great and included a pastry with pistachio ice cream covered in sour cherries. It was definitely a great ending to a better than ok meal. 
The service was kinda spotty. Maybe it was a cultural thing, but coming from NYC, I've experienced plenty of great service along with a fair amount of crappy and pretentious service. This seemed a bit in between. On the one hand, the older/balder/tattooed server didn't offer to take our drink orders at any point, forgot an item and added something that we hadn't actually ordered, which we were ok with accepting, but if you're not going to write down an order, you should at least be able to remember everything.  He was also a bit condescending when taking our order, with a couple of warm and fuzzy moments later that we could all appreciate. Maybe it was his shtick, but it didn't quite work. When we asked if we could order drinks, he did choose a few great wines to go with the food though. 
Perhaps this review was unfair, since we only tried a small part of the menu and it depends on ones personal taste, but overall, the mythical status given to Joe Beef seemed highly unjustified by the end of our dinner. I've definitely eaten much better meals with way greater and more professional service for half the price, after which I immediately wanted to go back for another meal. Sorry if that disappoints anyone, but I'm doing my best to be honest."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas l'engouement pour ce restaurant, un effet de mode probablement. Les plats sont excessivement salés, et le sel est un bon exhausteur de goût quand on ne sait pas réveler les saveurs autrement.
Le staff vous accueille de façon hautaine, victimes de leurs succès il faut croire.
Et à la fin ça fait très mal au portefeuille pour une expérience que je n'ai pas trouvée mémorable. Alors certes les portions sont gigantesques, mais même si j'ai bon appétit ça ne m'intéresse pas de payer pour une assiette que je ne finirai de toute façon pas"}
{"text":"Our ne favourite in Montreal. It used to be Europea  (which is excellent) but this is a happening spot.
Very interesting menu and great staff. 
Just go, and say \"What should we have?
You will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Grabbed a last minute reservation on DINR while in Montreal... We were blown away. The dinner rush is quite crowded and loud, and the environment was off-putting initially. However that changed as soon as the drinks and food landed at our table. The entire meal transported us to a different state of mind and we enjoyed every lingering taste and sensation of the evening. Before we knew it, we were the last people in the restaurant enjoying a drink with the staff as they were closing up shop. Do yourself a favor and do whatever you can to pay a visit. Set up daily notifications on DINR and cross your fingers!"}
{"text":"Great place for a relaxed night out with amazing food and drinks. Best Bloody Caesars you will ever find!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. The staff is amazing and knowledgeable. The food is tremendous. 5 stars is not enough. Merci!"}
{"text":"Lived up to all the hype

The menu changes daily with only some staples remaining. One of those staples is the lobster spaghetti. It sounds simple and boring but it was spectacular. 

I've been to Montreal a handful of times and this was the first time I was able to get a reservation. I'll definitely plan ahead next time to ensure i go again."}
{"text":"A Montreal institution. It's tiny, packed, noisy, crowded and generally amazing. The food was really good. The service was fantastic. And the experience is one of those dinners that you'll never forget. 

Go.  Listen to your server's suggestions. The desserts were amazing - so when they recommend dessert after an amazing dinner, listen!  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"We were visiting from the States and heard about Joe Beef from the concierge as well as trip advisor. The ambience in the garden was nice and weather absolutely beautiful.  The food was also out of this world but too much food for the both of us. In hindsight we would have shared one steak. The waitress was well informed about the menu and everyone accommodated our non-French speaking. One draw back is the price. It is extremely expensive so be prepared!  If you are visiting from the states, be prepared for 2 taxes and our bill with tip for 2 was nearly $300.  As I said before, excellent food but very pricey."}
{"text":"Que c'est bon! Oui oui vraiment bon.... Réserver votre place ( c'est long) mais ça vaut vraiment le détour ! Partagez vos plats pour goûter à tout..."}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the single greatest meal I've ever had. Every single part of it, from the wine recommendations to the friendly, helpful service, to every single bit of food that was placed on our table was completely flawless and to-die-for delicious. 

The Blue Cheese and Endive Salad was a complete stunner. Occasionally salads are a bit of a throwaway item, ordered more to ease the guilt of the decadent items to follow, but this was...like...I have no words. It was massive, and we polished off the whole bowl because it was so great.

We also ordered the razor clams, roast beef, arctic char, and for dessert, vanilla and pear ice cream with chocolate ganache and poached pear. Everything was the best thing I've ever eaten. Every single thing.

It kind of breaks my heart that I have to go back home to a city with no Joe Beef. It honestly would be worth coming back to Montreal to do nothing else but have dinner here though. 

I'm in love."}
{"text":"Love Joe Beef. Been here a few times and always something interesting and new on the menu. We like to pick the most unusual items on the menu and are never disappointed. Service is always excellent, even if seated at the counter or seated at a table hidden in a corner. A place we come back to because the menu changes so often and seasonally."}
{"text":"We both had bavette and.it was.insanely delicious. Ended our meal with the almond cake. I still dream.of this meat. And we will definitely come.back soon. It's worth the long waiting list."}
{"text":"Great food wish I could go there every night. High prices though will make it a special occasion restaurant for me. 
Had the soft shell crab thought I had died and gone to heaven
Totally unpretentious  friendly service."}
{"text":"Top ten meal.  Whenever I told anyone I was going to Montreal they mentioned Joe's Beef.   Two friends and I were in for the weekend.  Last night it was two of us.  My dining companion's flight was late and I waited for about 40 minutes at at the bar.  What first stuck me other than the appeal of the hipster-foodie/lumberjack decor and vibe was how totally nice yet casual every person working there was. 

The bartender made me a killer vodka Moscow Mule. He then translated the entire menu, written on a board, to me.  The menu is almost shocking in its combinations of oddness, strange coherence and it's outright appeal. Ordering would require a lot of thought. 

The hostess knew I was waiting for a late friend.  She kept coming by to check on me to make sure I knew they they where cool with her being late and to make sure I was happy.  When Karen came the bartenders and others were audibly happy enough that the woman next to me asked us who we were. 

We ordered three appetizers and two mains.  We made a comment like \"We are ordering a lot.\"  Our sweet and funky server said \"Oh no.  There is no ordering too much here.  Everyone eats here.\"

The first dish was a smoked beef ragu pappardelle with a fried egg.  It's was fantastic; eye-rolling. 

Next came a dish Karen ordered.  A crab dish with a soft boiled egg encased in a savory jell.  I had now intention of eating it because of a mild crab allergy but when I saw the contrast between the rustic salad-like crab covered in fingerling chips and the elegant egg which frankly looked like a desert you would see in a bakery in Vienna I had to check it out.  The chips where fried in crab fat. I'll repeat that.  The chips where fried in fricken crab fat.  It's was worth the hives. 

The final appetizer was a split toasted long roll with a mixture of local mushrooms and morrel with a light ham, ramps, fiddle heads and a mornay sauce. It came to us with each saying we where topped off and would only taste it so we could also try the mains.  We polished the entire thing off.  Quickly. It's was amazing. 

For my main I had a dish of braised pork shoulder, white beans, lettuce and sausage.  It was another eye-roller. The pork was steak-like but cut across the grain and both crisped and falling apart at the same time.  We where both gob smacked and talked for a bit to try to figure out how it was prepared. 

Karen's main was the petit steak (a meager 10 ounces) topped with smoked beef, provolone and raw tomato served over the most unctuous beef jus I've ever had.  This dish was the first and only stumble of the night. But it was a stumble soon to be turned into virtue by our excellent sever.  The dish was stone cold.  We told the server and she apologized with a slight tinge of doubt in her voice.  She came back 2 minutes later and said with a measure of agony and embarrassment \"You are right it was cold.  We are so sorry.  You will have best hot steak you have ever had in a few minutes.\"  It came back and unlike its tepid forbearer it was amazing.  Impressive because the combination could easily be obese-person-food but it was a combination of over the top things that somehow managed to seem subtle and right together (when served hot).   

At this point we were both uncomfortably full but Karen went for a dessert.   It was a pretty yet rustic chocolate puff pastry filled with a kirsch chocolate pastry cream roughly coated in chocolate topped with a boozy cherry.  I managed a lick of a spoonful.  It was great and seemed as light as a rustic chocolate puff pastry filled with a kirsch chocolate pastry cream roughly coated in chocolate topped with a boozy cherry can possibly be. 

Great experience. Amazing food.  Lovely people.  Our mistake was eating at Joe's Beef as our first meal in Montreal.  All of our subsequent carefully chosen meals this weekend will pale in comparison. The third of us is arriving today.  The experience at Joe's will be even more delicious because we are going to tease the shit out of her because she missed a truly stellar frame shifting meal."}
{"text":"We tried this place in January. Make sure you take a reservation and you may have to plan weeks ahead. The Double Down Foie Gras is a must but beware of heart attackss! The Petite Truite du Quebec had an interesting presentation, how it was wrapped with its skin, taste was ok. The Lobster Spaghetti was a huge disapointment and way overpriced. Though it was not lobster season so that may excuse the poor meat texture but the pasta did not seem home made at all. We were charged for the bread. In summary I would say overpriced due to the hype and you can find much better restaurants at this budget."}
{"text":"Perfect evening at Joe Beef during our honeymoon trip to Montreal. Small plates were the real star of the show. As the menu (chalk board of daily dishes) is all in French, we had the waitress create a meal for us which she was happy to do. Courses were perfectly timed for a very leisurely experience. Total for 2 people with a $85 CAnadian bottle of Wine was about $310 CAnadian before tip."}
{"text":"So I stalked this restaurant for months before my visit to Montreal, having been told it as a must try while in town.

At the two month mark they were already fully booked for the two days I was planning to be in town. Devastating!

Determined to eat there, I called back daily to ask if anything had opened up. After about two weeks of this the staff kindly informed me that my best bet was to wait until day-of. So come last week during my trip, I started calling as soon as the reservations line opened. 

Heartbreakingly - no cancellations and according to the reservationist, no openings at their reservation only location. Did I give up at this point? No way!

Showed up at the restaurant about twenty minutes before it's 6pm opening. They were still having a staff meeting. Whoops. Around 5:55 those with actual reservations began lining up and when they came to start seating them - the hostess found us a solution right away! We got to eat there!

While I guess there is no guarantee this would happen to you, I can say this approach was absolutely worth it for me. Where else are you going to eat:

-a deboned quail stuffed in ricotta and wrapped in pork, covered in lobster broth and chunks of lobster
-foie gras in a ravioli immersed in duck broth
-French fries fried in beef fat
-Veal sweetbreads covered in braised antelope and mushroom gravy 
-the most delicious hazelnut chocolate ganache almond and vanilla cream cake I've ever had
-lobster spaghetti (ok to be fair you can get this at their sister restaurant nearby)

They also have their own branded sparkling wine!

Interestingly there is a garden in the back but I'd be hard pressed to name many or any vegetables in the meal we ordered here. 

So yeah. Would I stalk this restaurant again? Absolutely. Maybe 3 months ahead instead of just 2, next time."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from locals we met who seemed somewhat cool, and reading reviews promising extremely good meat, we rode bixi bikes here from old town on our second night in Montreal. It took much longer than we expected for some reason, this city is bigger than it seemed at first. But we arrived around 10 pm and were surprised (in a good way coming from NYC) to still see a line out the door waiting to talk to the hostess at that time. We didn't have reservations but they were able to fit us in at a tiny, but private area of the bar in the back room. We felt like we were at a larger version of five leaves in Brooklyn. We were confused about the blackboard menu and couldn't really see it at all from where we were, but had already been told to order the lobster spaghetti and ribs so ordered those two dishes and a salad, which we were told came from their garden. Everything was excellent, bartender who took our order and talked with us during the meal was very cool
and friendly, we had a couple of glasses of good wine and they even gave us free dessert because there was an extra one someone ordered on accident. We had no idea how much any of this was costing since there was no menu we could see, but we were buzzed and on vacation so didn't really care. We were slightly alarmed when the bill came and the entrees were $50 and $30. Everything else was pretty normal pricing. We still don't know which was $50, but guessing the lobster spaghetti, which was amazing and worth almost any price. 
All in all was excellent food, very cool place, slightly overpriced and confusing ordering system/menu but worth it, just not for everyday. I would actually recommend sitting at the bar, I felt like we had better service (it was like having our own private waiter) and it seemed more comfortable than the tables I saw, the tables looked tiny and cramped."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Definitely lives up to the hype with outstanding PEI oysters, decadent lobster spaghetti, delicious cod fish with five different kinds of sauteed onions - as well as a perfectly cooked filet mignon.   Pleasant attentive service and a homy yet upbeat vibe add to the experience - but if you want truly awesome, tasty food - don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Limited seating so reservations are recommended. We lucked out on a Tuesday night at 8:30 with the one free table. We enjoyed the tripe appetizer, horse steak and duck. Since they don't print the menu, the server was essential in guiding us through our options. Happily we also bonded with the couple next to us so we were able to try the rabbit as well. Everything was wonderful. Definitely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to score a reservation here last night!  It definitely lived up to its reputation. 

We needed help with blackboard since we don't speak French. No problem because the server was very helpful. She went over everything..good thing. 

I started with the oysters which were excellent. My husband had the half double down which I think enough has been posted about. He loved it as much as everyone else has on this board. 

For mains it was rabbit for me and lamb for him. The rabbit was so amazing with a carrot sauce and tortellini. I ate every bite...extremely rare for me. The lamb was so unique. It was in the shape of a giant ball and served with polenta and braised greens. He just about licked the plate. 

We typically skip dessert but had to have it since everything else was so amazing. We ordered the meringue and it was perfect- a completely unique twist of a dessert just like the other yelpers said. I highly recommend it and everything else we had. 

So glad we went here! Go if you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"Punishing and decadent. In a good way. Joe Beef is where you go when you've had enough of clean living and want to give your arteries a workout. It's been a couple years since we've been here as recent media appearances by the owners (Bourdain's shows etc) have rendered this the go to spot for out of towners, and reservations are hard to come by. We met 5 groups in line (more on that later) and none were from Montreal. In that time Joe Beef seems to have morphed from a neighborhood restaurant into hipster central. Reggae and rap blasting all night, super informal service and packed with kids (we're in our 30's and felt on the cusp of irrelevancy amongst this crew).  The only sour note of the meal was waiting in line in the rain while looking through the windows at 15 year old servers languidly setting the five free tables while the five sets of diners outside who had reservations looked on. Come on guys, getting your customers indoors and seated should be the priority!

But once seated all was forgotten. Perusing the chalkboard we settled on an opener of lobster and caviar, New Brunswick oysters, and raw scallop with pumpkin seed. Paired with a light and bubbly Rosé from Italy and our eyes were rolling back in our heads. 

Next up was the infamous Foie Gras Double Down. Twin pieces of deep fried foie forming the \"bun\" of a bacon and cheddar sandwich slathered in Quebec maple syrup. My informal calorie count had this somewhere in the the two thousand range. No problem since we paired it with in season local asparagus. Oops, the veggies are swimming in a tangy bechamel with more aged cheddar on top. Still the best asparagus I may have ever had, peeled and lightly steamed they were crisp and flavorful and offset the foie nicely. 

Our eyes were bigger than our stomaches and so we were only able to choke down a third of our shared steak. It came with fresh grated horseradish, and a fat slab of tomato on top with the whole thing resting in a gravy made and served right in the pan it was cooked in. Oddly antiquated presentation,  but the whole meal had something vaguely seventies about it which was actually kind of fun. 

We ended with espresso (way too bitter!) and an amazing rhubarb dessert. All in all one of the best meals I've ever had in Montreal, so despite the rocky start and the Peter Pan feel of the place the food lives up to its reputation."}
{"text":"So dinner was absolutely delicious and a fun time as well. We shared Tete fromage (head cheese) frisée with cornichons, greens and chopped egg on top .... Light and perfect! My husband had scallops infused with vermouth and I had a venison and foie gras pie topped with a scalloped potatoes crust - to die for. Dessert was some amazing Portuguese-type tarts with maple syrup and foie gras and they were perfect ... Accompanied by 4 types of cheese served with pain grille and fresh honey. The food here is phenomenal (why one of top 100 reataurants in the world) and the atmosphere is fun and laid back ... Wear jeans ... Whatever. We couldn't get a table for months but phoned and got seated at the bar - an event which helped make an already great meal thanks to our server Leo. He is knowledgeable about the menu and his wine suggestions were superb. We wanted a bottle and one was having scallops and the other game and he came out with a wonderful Pinot Noir that was full of minerals and lingered on the palette. Menu is written on a blackboard which adds to the casual and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really extraordinary.

Canadians, you have no excuse, you all have to go dine here. Fabulous.

In short: It seems pretty difficult to get reservations here, even at the bar. Book way ahead. Or call day of- its a long shot, but sometimes people cancel.

It is hard to spot this place from outside but this totally fits with the motif, Joe Beef is not trying too hard to win your affections, but it frigin wins them anyway with great service and wonderful quality food prepared elegantly. 

The food? Come on, its a joke its so great. Lobster spaghetti, foie gras apps, bloody mary with a clam and oyster, gorgeous veal shoulder with bone marrow risotto? Get out of town. I'd get this meal over and over again. Delicious, honest, sumptuously prepared favorites that taste of comfort food yet are delicate. 

The night my boyfriend and I went we were served by the sommelier, Alexandra. She told us she would take care of us and she far exceeded our expectations. We sat next to a wonderful couple and ended up eating, drinking, and laughing the night away with them. We had the most amazing night and Alexandra was a big part of it (girl deserves a raise!). We were never rushed and the staff work and flow like a family together. In the end, a kind young server called us a cab and told us where the driver should turn so we were not on a wild goose chase as tourists in from NY. Clearly, this experience was great in a lot of specific ways but I think across the board the exemplary service, great drink, unpretentious atmosphere, and all-star food is sure to win you over too."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant in a bustling atmosphere. We couldn't get a reservation, but walked by and took a chance - and were able to grab the last two seats in the restaurant. The extensive menu on the black board is impressive, and the wine list is enormous! Do whatever you can to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"We ate at Joe Beef on June 1 and found it lived up to it's legendary billing. Huge menu with varied options and killer wine list, mostly from Burgundy, my favorite. The raw bar was very impressive. Lots to choose from and all fresh. My wife and I split a dozen assorted oysters to start and they were very fresh and briny. I got the Porchetta seasoned ribs and they were fabulous, and a steal at $26 as it was a full rack. They were served with frites topped with finely milled brined Italian vegetables. My wife got the famous house lobster spaghetti and there was too little lobster and too much spaghetti, especially for $46. The downside was the service was slooow. We drank a bottle of wine while waiting about 40 minutes for our mains. Also, the music, which we loved, as so loud we had to yell at each other. All in all, I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"De loin mon restaurant haut de game favori. Tous est delicieux ici."}
{"text":"The food was good ,but the service was the stand out .. Our waitress was really friendly and had a good knowledge of the menu.she was very informative .If I was to give a score just for the service it would be 5 stars !
I went there with my wife and another couple .. We were very satisfied with our meals , big portions and real tasty .. The only thing was my steak , it was good but I think I was expecting to have one of the best steaks I have tried.. It was not even close but it was still enjoyable .. The stand out dish was the pork and also the smoked trout , both were delicious . Overall it was a memorable dining experience , will definintly be back ."}
{"text":"We went to Montreal for the weekend and when I called here there were no available reservations. However in our wanderings, we managed to stumble upon it and got a table! We started with a seafood platter which was so fresh and delicious, we also shares a fois gras double-down. I loved the high brow/low brow combination. It also had a honey sauce on it which was very, very good. 

I ordered the steak there, my boyfriend ordered the horse. I Ioved my steak - I can't speak much for the horse. But in short, if you're looking for great food that is innovative and creative, definitely check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of hype about Joe Beef, so when my parents asked if I wanted to join them in trying it out, I jumped on the offer.  I am happy to report that it did not disappoint!

The space is small.  Tiny.  But it has a lot of character.  We were a group of 5, so we got a cosy banquette.  Like others have pointed out, the menu is written on the chalkboard wall, and is tiny and somewhat hard to see in the low light.  I was a bit overwhelmed, everything sounded great!  The waitstaff are very helpful in describing the dishes, but make it even harder to choose because everything sounds amazing.  After the slight stress of ordering (and making sure everyone at our table tried something different), the rest of the meal was pure enjoyment.  

The food.  Oh the food!  Everything was delicious.  We split a few apps amongst us, and we were especially delighted by the eel cakes.  The breading was really light, the inside a little mushy (in the best way possible) and the dipping sauces made things fun.  The winner of the mains was a toss up between the duck breast (with smoked meat and pickles), and the rabbit dish.   Yes, this was definitely a meat-tastic meal!  The rabbit was really interesting as it combined more traditional rabbit meat with what could only be described as a rabbit cabbage roll.  A cabbage roll from heaven!  The other dishes we had included the lamb, the Joe Beef steak and the scallops.  If you like greasy french fries, definitely get an order of them.  They are coated in some sort of spice/cheese mix that is addictive.

By the time we were done with our mains, we just couldn't do dessert, as much as the waitress tried to tempt us.  Portions are huge.  They don't seem so daunting when they arrive, but partway through we all gave up and gave in to a takehome bag (which they package up quite nicely for you).

Joe Beef doesn't go all out with their presentation nor their decor.  It's comfortable and homey and loud, so that you can sit back and relax and have an amazing meal.  This is definitely going to be my \"special occasion/let's go out and celebrate/save up for an indulgence\" restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"I had massively high expectations for Joe Beef but was somewhat disappointed. Most of our dishes were somewhat cold and underwhelming. Had a better overall experience at their sister restaurant Liverpool House. I hate to be so critical but this place is hyped beyond belief. Staff was very nice and the wine was excellent though."}
{"text":"We came into the meal with high hopes based on the reviews and hype. Ultimately, the food was really just OK. They're known for Lobster Spaghetti and it was the best dish we ordered. The 16 oz steak was also quite good. Our final two dishes, the horse and the lamb, were pretty forgettable. There are better restaurants in Montreal where you get more for your money and don't have to wait weeks for a reservation."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten this well in a very long time.  I live near NYC so I've been spoiled by the quality of good food there.  Joe Beef wasn't the best meal I've had but it was probably the best meal I've had in Montreal.  I totally love how it has a different menu every day.  That means there are so many different dinner possibilities. I will definitely come back here in the near future. I want to try everything!

The wait staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  They are also very knowledgeable with the items on the menu.

There were four people in our party and we were seated at a nice cozy booth right across from the menu on the chalkboard.  It was dimly lit and very homey.  I wanted to take a nap after my meal.  We also noted the music was very good and a whole variety of old classics from the 90's. Haha.

The four of us opted to get the special beer made especially for Joe Beef.  It was served in really large old fashioned beer bottles.  It was very refreshing and it went very well with our meal.

For appetizers, we got the Foie Gras Double Down (how could you not get that?), single portion; raw oysters, a salad with cheddar cheese (sorry for the description but I cannot read French) and a white ham sliders appetizer.

The double down was everything I hoped for. We split it 4-ways and it's a good thing I did.  It was delicious.  The two slabs of foie gras was deep fried, like fried chicken and in the middle was a bacon slice, some cheese and some greens. It was delectable.  A double portion would be very tempting but I think I'd die of a heart attack afterwards.

The oysters were very fresh and served with cocktail sauce and a mignonette sauce. They were soo good. I wish we had more but one of the kinds were sold out.

The salad was nice and fresh and it was a nice balance to the foie gras.  The ham sliders were also very good but very filling because of all the bread.

For the main course, we ordered the rabbit, the Joe Beef Steak, the pork chop and smoked ribs.

The rabbit was good - it tasted like non fatty chicken but that was my first time I had rabbit. My husband raves about rabbit and he seemed to love it.  The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and I ordered the Madame portion of it (10 oz). There was a Monsieur portion available at 18 oz but that sounded way too big with all the other stuff I was eating.  The meat was perfectly seasoned so I had no need of the steak sauce that came on the side and the bed of spinach was also delicious.  I don't know why it tasted so good but I just remembered it was like heaven on a plate.

I was really impressed with the pork chop. It was a huge pork chop too and it was cooked to perfection.  Totally tenderly and it seemed like it melted in your mouth.  The smoked ribs was a surprise.  It was probably the best ribs I've ever had.  Smoked to perfection and falling off the bone. So freaking good.  These guys really know how to cook their meat!

By that time, I had no room for dessert but my party each wanted their own dessert so I caved in.  I ordered Financier on the Cob and my group ordered the Patate au Four, the chocolate mint sundae and a panna cotta that came with some melon granita.  They were all delicious but I think the Patate au Four was the best one.  The coffee is also very good and I had some herbal tea that was presented really fancily. I should have taken a picture of it but totally forgot in my happy food coma.

I will definitely go back again and that's a promise.  Make sure you make your reservations early. I thought I had made my reservation relatively early but only the 9:30pm openings were available on certain days.  This is a must go to restaurant if you enjoy meat.  It's perfection.

I have a more extensive review on my blog complete with pictures but Yelp made me take the link off of this review.

{"text":"First... The food is good. I can't add much to what has been said. My beef with Joe Beef is the way the menu was communicated to us. Menus are written on a board on the wall, common enough, but we could not see the menu from our table. When our (very nice) server came to our table to tell us about the menu she only told us about half of the menu... We told her that we preferred beef or other meat over fish and she really only told us about the meaty dishes on the menu. We had to inquire specifically about the vegetables and never got to some items we would have ordered had we known about them. On one hand I should've definitely  asked her to run through the entire menu, on the other hand should I really have had to ask if it was not in front of me?
The menu is in French... I don't speak it but my girlfriend does though that wasn't really an issue - simply the menu should be easy for all to see or communicated in full to ensure that diners make the best choices for them."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal, and we knew we had to come here. We had called for reservations 1 week ahead of time, and we had the 930 time slot. We had been walking around the area and came about 10 minutes early to check in with the hostess. We were expecting bar seating, but the hostess surprised us and seated us right in the cozy, front window seat. We were greeted by a fantastic waitress, who went through the whole menu with us and suggested appetizers. We had a lot of duck, and it was delicious! My two friends had the tripe appetizer, and we shared the other duck appetizers. My friend and I shared the New York strip steak with brussel sprouts, and spinach. My other friend had duck with potatoes. For dessert, we had a chocolate mousse cake and a several layer cake with hazelnut. The food was delicious, the beer was delicious, the servers were fantastic, everyone was pleasant, and it was a fantastic night in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! The lobster pasta is a must try
! Highly recommend this restaurant. Expect to pay the big bucks though. The menu chances all the time except for the lobster pasta that is the most asked for dish on the menu. They always write their menu on a blackboard."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most famous restaurants in Montreal.  I never get a chance to go because you have to make reservations like months in advance.  I called a few weeks before my trip and luckily they had one spot open up.  Me and my cousin decided to take advantage of this opportunity and ordered like 5 plates to split.  We basically just asked the bartender for his favorite dishes and ordered those.  Overall, the food is very well cooked and delicious.  The only thing holding me back would be the price.  It was a bit under $200 for 2 heavy eaters.  Good thing the American dollar was strong at the time :)."}
{"text":"En amoureux... nous étions les seuls du restaurant... Mais avec raison, car il était 22h passé et c'était le seul restaurant qui ne fermé pas ces portes à cette heure-ci. Nous étions désespérés de trouver une place où se poser pour se rassasier. Ce fut le seul restaurant ayant les moyens de subvenir à nos besoins: manger au chaud! Oui l'anecdote s'était produit en février.
L'endroit comporte une ambiance et une déco conviviale! La nourriture est de qualité, mais il faut se préparer à avoir de quoi payer sur sa carte bancaire. Avis: ne pas y aller en temps de crise, afin de survivre pour le mois ;)"}
{"text":"I'm here because of Anthony Bourdain's Montreal episode on Parts Unknown. This was my boyfriend and I's first time in Montreal, we chose this restaurant as our one \"fancy\" restaurant where we could splurge and no doubt we made the right choice! This place was easily the best meal we had on our trip.  We are originally from CA so we went in wanting to try food that we could not get in the States. For our appetizer we got the foie gra (duck liver) parfait served with two Texas-size toasted brioche slices. The parfait had a layer of spicy red pepper jelly on top and a side of a home-made garlicky chilli paste (that packed a big spicy punch in the mouth) which balances the richness of the foie. This dish was so well thought out and balanced, the inner foodie in me could not be happier. 

Our entrée consist of chicken with mash potatoes and peas, Horse filet mignon served with a side of beef-fat fries sprinkled with herbs and parmesan cheese, then finished off with a couple of hand-crafted cocktails. This is our first time trying horse meat, it was definitely a YOLO moment for me and it was amazing! According to our waitress, you had to eat it on the rare side to fully enjoy it. She didn't really asked how we wanted it cooked, she pretty much told us you're having this rare haha. It was definitely one of those moments where I felt that \"real restaurants\" that truly respect the food and ingredients, tell you how to enjoy the food which I totally respect and it didn't bother me at all. The steak was tender and not gamey. It reminded me of beef steak with less beefy flavor?, but the texture was the same and I probably would have assume it was beef if not otherwise informed. The chicken dish was also amazing! I tend not to order chicken at restaurants because the kitchen usually overcooks it becoming extremely dry and borderline inedible. But not this place! Most tender and juicy chicken ever! 

Cons: We barely touched the beef-fat fries because it was so heavy. The cocktails we got were mediocre. Mine taste like lemonade and a splash of vodka in it, for hand-crafted cocktails I guess I expected a little more of a \"wow factor\" and I was underwhelmed. Also, the double-down is no longer on the menu but the les parfait de foie gras totally made up for it."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend's dad a couple years ago. Just Wow."}
{"text":"Je ne sais même pas par ou commencer tellement nous avons adoré !

Le resto est situé juste en face du théâtre Corona sur Notre-Dame, c'est un coin que j'affectionne particulièrement. Je trouve ça tellement beau. Sans prétention, la vitrine du Joe Beef nous montre quelques tables, ce n'est vraiment pas grand, et ça explique un peu la difficulté d'y avoir une réservation.  On nous installe dehors sur la terrasse, exceptionnellement ouverte en raison de la douce température d'octobre. 

D'entrée de jeu, le service est impeccable. Je teste toujours l'habileté des serveurs/barmaid  en leur demandant de me préparer quelque chose de leur cru, une spécialité de la maison. On m'apporte un drink style mojito, mais au gingembre et citronelle, au gin Hendrick's ( mmmm), contenant des ingrédients directement pris du potager, adjacent a notre table. Délicieux ! Le dry Martini de mon homme est également a son goût, et ce n'est pas peu dire ! Nos deux autre convives optent pour de la bière, mais ne sont pas impressionnés. Pour le repas nous prenons une bouteille de rouge italien, je ne saurais dire lequel. 

En entrée un Double Down ( genre de chair a saucisse fourrée au foie gras en guise de pain avec une tranche de smoked meat et choucroute a l'intérieur ). Et les pétoncles sauce crémeuse au crabe avec caviar noir. Un vrai délice. Pour la suite des choses, les hommes optent pour le steak Monsieur ( une EXTRA généreuse portion de steak de boeuf avec une sauce au vin) et pour ma part je prend le mignon de cheval enrobé de bacon et servi avec un fromage crémeux a la bière. trois lettre W O W. jaw-dropping. Les cuissons étaient parfaites. Juste un petit avertissement le fromage sur le cheval est excessivement fort et vieilli. Pas pour les fines bouches. 

Une soirée coûteuse mais qui a valu la peine !!"}
{"text":"After listening to the hype and reading the reviews we decided to try Joe Beef on our last visit to Montreal. What a terrible disappointment. 

The place has charm and an ambiance that is genuine. However, there are some real deficiencies in the way the place is operated. 

When you walk in the door you'll be told to look at the giant chalkboard on the wall on the left hand side of the room. It is HUGE. And, written on it in very tiny letters is the menu. Entirely in French with no hints whatsoever. This is the only menu. In a packed restaurant you have no choice but to go back to the front, stand at someones table, literally, and try to quickly read the French menu. It's absurd. If you don't get lucky with an extremely patient English speaking waiter you are out of luck. The wine list is also on the board, and also French. 

Let's move on to the food. I don't know how to re-define the word \"heavy\" when it comes to food. Let's just say Joe Beef does a good of trying to do just that. The food was OK, but certainly not a top restaurant. It's a tourist attraction, and you should be prepared for exactly that rather than a dining experience. The \"Double Down\", their famous fried foie gras appetizer, was awful. It was so heavy it tainted the remainder of our meal. The buratta was good but far too involved with added elements and completely unnecessary ingredients. The beef was good, but it was not \"shout from the mountaintops\" good. It was a decent piece of meat, that's all. Desert was great; chocolate something or other.  

Our fellow diners were a combination of rookie foodies and tourists; an unsophisticated crowd to say the least. It's the type of place you take an out of town guest so they can go home with a story. It's not the place for a fine dining experience. Though we had good service and a great bottle of wine, the $362 tab for the two of us felt like a total and complete scam. From my perspective, Anthony Bourdain damaged his reputation with his over the top recommendation of this place."}
{"text":"I always think of Joe Beef as being one of the top restaurants in Montreal. However, on my latest visit they did not live up to their reputation. The food was good but far from outstanding and the service was also good but not at the highest level. The prices however, remain high.

I eat at Joe Beef ever now and then and always greatly anticipate my visits. I expect to love the food but have been disappointed on my last visit. At our last meal at Joe Beef I found the food not to be up to its usual level. There were three items that disappointed us. In the buffalo mozzarella entree the fine flavour of the smoked cheese was completely overpowered by the overly strong sour flavour of the pickled vegetables. The cheese should be the star of this dish but you could not even taste it. 

We then had the lobster pasta which use to be served with a delicate bisque that was so wonderful I would have loved the dish even if there had not been an entire lobster sitting on the plate! This week the sauce was think and heavy and not nearly as enjoyable. We also had the halibut, which I expected to be light and melt in your mouth perfection. Unfortunately the fish was heavy and very chewy. 

One other disappointment was the server who took our desert order (not the same person who took the rest of our order). When describing the ice cream she failed to mention that there were nuts in this dish. Luckily my wife, who is allergic to pistachios and cashews, noticed the topping before digging in and possibly sending herself into anaphylactic shock. This same topping of nuts was also on the Hazel Nut cake and again our server failed to mention it. I was shocked that at a restaurant of this quality a server would fail to mention such an important detail."}
{"text":"Yassssssss this place is amazing! I hate spending money but I would happily spend money here. We went big and got a huge oyster platter to start; amazing selection of oysters from BC, PEI, and Maine that were delicious. We also got the smoked meat croquettes that were tiny bites packed with flavour. My partner obviously ordered the most expensive cut of red meat on the menu and I got the lobster curry. We accompanied with some cocktails and a bottle of red recommended by the waiter that was delicious. He was super helpful and clever and made the experience even nicer than it already was. We finished with a pear and chocolate ganache sundae that I literally still dream about. The food was really spectacular and the wine and service matched. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is, no exaggeration, the best meal we've ever had. When we sat down our waitress, Isabelle, said there was several ways we could do this: she could tell us all about the menu & we decide what we want or she could make the choices for us. After telling her that we didn't want snail, she took it from there. Every course was a well thought out, spectacular surprise. We wouldn't have ever chosen the things she chose for us! The lobster spaghetti was a highlight, but truly every dish was incredible. This is a night we will never forget!"}
{"text":"The best food I've ever eaten. My wife and I shared the foie gras parfait entree (appetizer) and we ordered a 1/2 poulet (chicken) and jarret de boeuf (beef shank) for plats (main course)- all we're absolutely amazing. 

This was my first experience with foie gras and I now get the hype; this was like the Rolls Royce of liver pâté; a must try! Both mains were excellent as well but I must make mention of the portion sizes- inhumanly large. So large I would even argue that Joe Beef is in a way a value restaurant. At C$28.00 for the mains we ordered and considering the quality and portion size, Joe Beef is comparatively not as astronomically priced as its reputation; especially if, like us, you're American with the current exchange rate. The issue is that it is near impossible to finish the meal; my wife couldn't finish the shank and I would say I ate about 95% of the chicken before cutting myself off. I should've stopped sooner but it was seriously the best chicken I've ever eaten! While locals could certainly taken leftovers home, as tourists in a spartan value hotel we don't have a fridge to keep left over beef shanks in so that became a little inconvenient! For the  future we are wondering if you could share a plate... I feel like for two ordering two entrees and one plat to share would probably be a bit better as far as the amount of food goes.

Service was overall good but I felt a bit of awkwardness in how casual or formal they were. On one hand the prices demand a certain class and formality but Joe Beef certainly has too much personally to be stuffy and the waiter made some welcomed jokes with us but at other times came off just a little bit aloof. The menu is a little intimidating for non French speakers but could certainly be worse. The waiter was also more than willing to answer questions and make honest recommendations; that is to say when I told him that I was in between two dishes he immediately answered and named the significantly less expensive choice- that concern for the customer's satisfaction over the potential for a bigger bill gets you big points in my book.

This is definitely a must try if in Montreal. Just remember to book far in advance; I booked three weeks early and the best I could get was a Wednesday at 9:45 PM!!"}
{"text":"Off the wall entrees, rich food, cool peeps, a bit pricey - but worth the experience. Bring your cardiologist's cell number just in case."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the most overrated place I've been to. We were lucky and had a reservation for 4 people. For the amount you pay and the taste of the food, I don't get the hype about this place. I know my review will probably be over looked and lost in the sea of Yelpers over the top reviews, but it's a place you try once and never go back. Just to see what all the hype is about. At the end the cost was $160 per person. If you're looking to save on some money, stay away from the wine. It seems like they are gouging. I'm no wine expert, but when your wine list starts at $80, it's fishy to me. The menu is very hard to read (not just because it was in french, but on a chalkboard on one side of the room with little lighting). 

Luckily the waiter was patient with us( I guess he's used to tourists coming in and asking the same questions). Very patient and helpful for sure. The best was the creamy frois grois that was added to our smoked duck. I still have dreams about it. THAT GOOD. The trout was pretty good too. All the other dishes were pretty good but not what you would expect with this hype and price. 

He wanted us to try the steak there but we decided not to. It seemed like the popular choice, but since we were going to have steak the next day we decided not to. Maybe try it out and see how it is. He also said the lobster spaghetti and oysters were popular. 

Overall, 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down on it. 

Best advice, take a picture of the menu. Helps so much. From my time there, the left was entrees then white wine then red wine."}
{"text":"Good but not great. They definitely have an inventive menu that is the main appeal to me. Corn Flake Eel Croquettes??!! Tried it and it was different but good!  Staff was very nice but service was spotty. I had the lobster Spaghetti which was very good but served lukewarm. Also, the boys ordered the ribeye for two which they couldn't finish, but liked it. Overall a really noisy spot best enjoyed with friends where you need to shout to be heard which I thought distracted from the overall experience. I won't be a regular, but would go back if asked."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Both the staff and the food will make your visit amazing. Have the trout with pickled veg and the lobster pasta. Any choice won't be a wrong one."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is one of my favourites. It's in a great location, has a great cozy ambiance and the food is spectacular. 

I realize the double down is a joke, but when I was pregnant it was the most delicious food I'd ever tasted. 

The oysters are amazing; lobster spaghetti is decadent; duck delicious; and I once had a dessert here that has set the bar for all desserts thereafter - and none have lived up to this one: a pistachio cake covered in brandies cherries. It looked gorgeous and tasted better than it looked. 

This restaurant lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Food was amazing! Service was fantastic! We were lucky enough to get late reservations the night we flew into Montreal. This place is a must when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Lives up to the hype in every way.  We had the trout, fried soft shell crab, lobster spaghetti and NY strip. Within the top 5 meals of my life."}
{"text":"I tried to get reservations at Joe Beef for MONTHS before I was able to score a table for 2 on a weekend in the winter, so that may be why I knocked down a star. Who knows. We were SO excited to try this place out - after all, reviews are great, and it's hard to get a spot to eat there, so it must be great, right? RIGHT. Everything from our steaks to our desserts was great. Service was good but just a touch snooty. Prices are as expected. Would I be back? Not sure I'd be so persistent to get a seat to be honest. It was great, but I still prefer Gibby's as my go-to steakhouse!"}
{"text":"It's normal to travel 370 miles specifically for a restaurant, right? As soon as my boyfriend and I booked our flights to Montreal I reserved Friday dinner here. Three weeks away, and all I could get were two seats at the bar! This wound up being better in the end. Joe Beef's menu is ever-changing, written on a chalkboard on the wall (in French). The friendly bartender read us the entire menu, sharing recommendations as he went.  We ordered:

The freshest oysters I have ever tasted
Two appetizers - the famous foie gras double down (half order), a menu staple consisting of two fried pieces of foie gras with bacon and maple syrup sandwiched between; and a shredded turkey leg concoction that was reshaped around a bone to look like a drumstick.I could have stopped here and been satisfied. The foie gras was out of this world. Life changing. I am so lucky that I do not live in Montreal, I would turn into a foie gras double down

For entrees, I had veal scaloppini and Jamie had the half hen. Both came with generous sides of rice, mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. The veal was a bit salty, but everything else was perfect.

The courses were well-paced, and the bartender informed us that the restaurant allots at least three hours for each reservation. A refreshing and leisurely experience for us New Yorkers! Three hours later, the friendly barkeep gave us some maple sorbet to finish, and we were on our way, full and happy."}
{"text":"First the good...the food was very well prepared, interesting and creative. Spot prawns appetizer was out of this world. Our server was friendly and they were very accommodating with reservations. The chalkboard menu is very long, small, hard to read and impossible to see from many seats in the restaurant. Our server recommended we \"take a good look\" before sitting as we would not be able to see the menu again. Standing over someones table in a busy restaurant and staring at a LONG menu (still rather far off and hard to read) was not exactly what I felt like doing. Probably prevents many diners from really exploring the menu's options. Intentionally making things awkward for diners is weird. The food was great if you're into that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants I have ever been too. I will say my experience was incredible. I had a great seat at the bar and got to have some raw bar items and the house beer. I also had great conversations with other patrons and the the bartender. 
I ordered the horse filet with sausage, I might be rating this 5 stars just because the fact this was my first time trying horse, or because its one of the few places I could find that actually prepare it in a restaurant. But this might be one of the best \"different\" types of meats I have tried and everything on the plate was outta this world. This also had a great crowd, atmosphere, and the price was reasonable. I highly recommend trying this place to locals and anyone passing through, its worth it."}
{"text":"Well my budget only allowed me to go once over this institution and it's probably the best money I've ever spent. I know how ephemeral it must be for some but they clearly don't know the experience. Because Joe Beef is an experience. First you enter the room waiting to be seated like any other restaurant but you have to reserve your place to be sure to have one. It took us 2 months to be able to write this review! Anyway, then you have a dedicated waiter or waitress and they're not here just to take your order, they actually care about your choice and spend the time explaining which is which and for the wine lovers out there what goes with what. You don't feel like a simple customer and that's good in my book! Then the food. I took a half-duck with fries while my girlfriend took some spaghetti with lobster. A-MA-ZING! And it's not because it's expensive that you'll have less in your plate. Quite the opposite actually. We had a lot to eat and enjoyed it as much as we could. Believe it or not, I actually couldn't finish my meal! So I had some for the day after and it was still great! Now I understand why it gathered this reputation. That and the cozy atmosphere. Great place! Please make me rich so I can go back there more often!"}
{"text":"Nous avons réservé là pour notre fête un jeudi soir.

Le restaurant est beaucoup plus petit que je ne m'imaginais. 

L'ambiance est romantique.

En entrée, nous avons partagé 3 variétés d'huîtres  et des couteaux de mer avec deux verres de vin blanc. Un riesling je crois.

Pour le plat principal, nous avons pris la côte de buf pour deux qui était très tendre et goûteuse. C'était parfait, un très bon plat, mais il manquait peut-être un peu d'accompagnement. Nous avons pris 2 verres de vin rouge pour le repas. Pour le dessert, mon frère a pris une crème glacée. 

Le service était cordial, sans plus. 

Pour le repas, 6 huîtres, couteaux de mer, CotÈ de buf et une crème glacée, cela nous a coûté 200$ (avant taxes et pourboires). C'est le prix pour ce genre de restaurant qui est très bien réputé et qui mérite amplement sa réputation pour sa cuisine. La seule critique est à mon avis le prix pour le vin. Le prix du verre était près de 13$ et ça ne valait pas ce prix là à mon humble avis."}
{"text":"Its tiny and even cramped depending on where you sit, its old but the decor is OK but f*ck it!  Its all about the food!  

Smoked meat nuggets.
Chicken!!?? At Joe BEEF? Yup :)
Lobster and pasta? 

If you haven't been, go now.  If not to at least try it once."}
{"text":"It was difficult to get a table here so we got seats at the bar.  The service was warm and knowledgeable. The menu was inventive and tasty. It was one of the pricier meals we had in Montreal but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Menu is a huge pain in the ass for an American with no French skills....food is great, extremely eclectic but delicious and staff is great.  Worth every star."}
{"text":"Decided to come here. Got a reservation same day. Arrived on time, sat around 6:15 because the staff was having a prep meeting.

Decor was comfortable. Leather and wood, candles on tables, dim interior, walls filled with interesting knick-knacks, strings of lights. Romantic, classic restaurant vibe. We sat in the second room, in a row of two tops opposite an extensive wooden bar counter. There was also an attractive covered patio with heat lamps. Noise level was a pleasant bustle, intriguing rather than irritating.

Friendly and helpful wait staff - from welcome to service to departure. No individually written menus - everything is on chalkboards. As many others have noted, this means that we leaned heavily on conversation with the attentive staff and they helped select our menu to a large degree. Recitation of the entire menu in French or English, selection recommendations and the advice \"if something caught your attention while you were listening, get it!\" This because the menu changes frequently. If I had to say something less than positive it would mention the pacing of service - everyone had such extensive interaction with the wait staff and it felt like we needed to wait our turn occasionally.

Shared everything. If there is too much variety and not enough decisiveness, getting several starters and one entree seems like a great idea.

Starters: foie gras tart with fresh apple and textually complementary crust, garnished with shaved celery root waves and a dollop of bone marrow & foie gras parfait. The second dish was a stew of beans, root veg, and tripe served encircling roasted bone marrow. Satisfying to the extreme. Really wished for a bit of bread to sop up the gravy-like remains.

Entrees: perpetually available spaghetti with thick bacon bits and lobster - left delicious grease all over our lips, easy to shell, and as decadent as advertised. Was skeptical but there is a reason why this dish is always on the menu. Our second dish was smoked rabbit prepared several ways, alongside fresh bacon, homemade sauerkraut, and house mustard. Tasty but frankly I am wondering how much better the rare roast beef, veal liver, the sharable 32oz steak or the steakhouse sausage entrees might have been. (Pictures of most of the menu attached).

Dessert: enormous apple pie we almost skipped. Ordered after the couple next to us got it as well. Puff pastry, apple halves, caramel sauce and a heaping twist of fresh vanilla ice cream. Amazing if you are in the mood. Other options included layer cake, squash baked good with ice cream (w/ sparkler if you've just gotten married), and vanilla ice cream twisted with apple sorbet.

Dinner was great - go here if you like food."}
{"text":"arrive very hungry, and ready to eat high caliber food in a casual enviroment. Menu is on a chalk board and only in french but don't be intimidated, the waiter or hostess will go over the entire menu in great detail with you. Menu changes frequently but  the double down is famous and indulgent. It's two pieces of fried foie with cheese and bacon in between. I took a stab at the filet mignon of horse....literally. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, lovely wine and a comfortable room.  This place hits all the ideal restaurant characteristics for me.  We had this plate of gorgeous ham with a mustard sauce and a piece of seared foie, snow crab covered in decadent herby butter, a first for me - horse which was done tartare with brioche and wow they were all just great.  Also the famous lobster spaghetti just keeps getting better as you eat it.  They really pre crack all their shells well.  Wine list is on the pricier side but some really beauties at the 55 level!  

Oh and they actually said - finish your wine and then we'll talk about dessert!!!   So many times I've had to make that point to our waiter I don't think they've ever done it for me - I was in heaven."}
{"text":"One of the very first things we did when we found out we were going to Montreal was to book a reservation for Joe Beef, and we're thankful that we did. 

Everything was delicious and we did not walk out of there hungry. 

The tables are very very close together. When we arrived, they asked us to take a look at the menu (written on a chalkboard) and then to let them know when we were ready to sit down. Tip: I took a picture of the menu on my phone so I wouldn't have to stand there and look before deciding what I wanted to eat. When we were ready, they pulled out the table so I could get in to the other side, slid the table back to sort of trap me in, then my husband sat on the other side of the table. Doesn't sound too great in words, but I'm just trying to explain how close everyone is in the restaurant- we didn't mind it at all and enjoyed being able to see what everyone else was ordering as well. 

The menu is in French so I didn't really know what to order. The waitress was great at explaining items on the menu and making recommendations. We ordered too much and still got dessert. 

Foie gras double down - rich and tasty
Crab gratin? - good but not something I'd rave about or order again
Joe Beef Steal - delicious - I really liked the horseradish on top of the tomato and didn't need any of the sauce that came on the side
Husband had pork with a surprise egg in the middle - it was tasty too but sort of reminded me of the flavors of a roasted pig in Asian markets. 
Chocolate baked potato for dessert- I wish I got a picture of it before they chocolate sauce was poured over it but the reaction from others around us when this came out was worth ordering. 

Great service and very good food. I'd try to come back if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"A-ma-zing! I know the wait is like 2 hours, the service is a hit or miss and the price is sky high, but the food, oh the food, is freaking awesome! Had a four course meal starting with oysters, then appetizer, main and dessert. Drank an amazing bottle of wine and then crawled to my hotel in total ecstasy."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is a very very pricey place for the regular foodie. Be smart and ask the incredibly knowledgeable staff what their favorites are, this may also be necessary because of the dark ambiance in the resto. Ask and you shall receive I had the beef bourguignon which was amazing and decadent.Joe Beef is for those that enjoy rustic and fancy blended into a delicious combination of wow! If you love food this is a place that is very close to foodie heaven."}
{"text":"Oh Yes...what can I say that has not been said already by all culinary critics and food magazines?....There is Joe Beef and then, well there is everything else!
When in Montreal for a few days...first thing first...grab the phone and make a reservation at Joe Beef, they will do there outermost to accommodate you, which is not an easy task for a restaurant that is packed every day.
The place is small or at least it seems so because of the ongoing traffic of foodies, but delightful and hip. If you are very very lucky, you might even get the table standing in the middle of their produce and herb garden, but if you are not, the experience is all the same in every corner of this place, meaning: eclectic food at its absolute best and amazing service filled with knowledge and care.
Stop searching the internet for a menu, because you will find none. The menu is scribbled on a chalk board and varies with every season.
If you have the firm intention of ordering a specific bottle of wine, let it be, the owner will choose one for you anyway.
Whenever you get the bill, just throw your credit card on top of the unopened folder and forget about it, the one thing you do will remember for a very long time, is the best meal most of us will ever have. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a hyped up experience and that is what Joe Beef delivered only the food was really good. I would advise anyone going here to be watch out if they do not like organ meat because the table next to us ordered rabbit and duck but all I could smell was kidneys? There food smelled like piss and it made me feel a bit sick. My wife and I ordered whatever the waitress said. My 12 years of cooking experience in professional kitchens did nothing for me in terms of understanding the full on French menu on the hard to read chalkboard. The waitress very proudly said we sold out of this and that etc... Interesting point of view? Here in my city heads would roll if we ran out of anything really people get fired from kitchens for under prep anyhow. We got the sea bass for two as a main and I had a very interesting beet soup my wife enjoyed god knows what? It looked like a snow globe with currents and oil? She let me taste it and it was some kind of cheese unlike anything I have had before with artichoke and could have been pancetta I am not really sure. The most interesting part of the evening was the music guess just guess???? Wrong it was Biggie Smalls bitches eastside all up in the joint for real. I wanted to toss my folk and knife over my sholder and show off my gang signs. I prefer 2 pac myself not even kidding. For a 150 dollar dinner after tax and tip I should have dam well requested it. Peace out bitches... Westside!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. My wife and I had a wonderful time here. Service and food were great and worthy of the reputation."}
{"text":"Heard a ton about it and saw on anthony bourdain so had really high hopes. The service was excellent and although we had bar reservations they gave us a table instead which was nice. A downside is the impossible to read chalkboard menu which was behind me so either you have to awkwardly stand behind diners and stare at it or crane your neck 180degrees which is not comfortable at all. The bread was soooo good, best bread i can think of. The asparagus with egg and duck sausage was a great flavorful and rich appetizer and I was basically full after it but had already ordered the lamb which was succulent and fall off the bone. My boyfriend had the double down half which he did not think was the revelation everyone else seems to think. His lobster sausage was good but didn't blow his mind. Overall a hearty rich meal, came out to 120 with top which I guess isn't horrible but for no drinks or dessert is quite pricey!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experience my husband and I have had after waiting for months to snag a table on a week night. We had to settle for their Liverpool House on two separate trips, unable to get a table at this restaurant, where we also had wonderfully satisfying meals.The staff was spot on, explaining the dishes on the classic blackboard (written in French) with patience and enthusiasm. We started with a dozen oysters from four different bays off PEI (Prince Edward Isle). Tasted like they were just pulled from the water. We shared an endive salad, but not just any endive salad. It was beautifully presented like flower petals with a simple vinaigrette, blue cheese and candied walnuts. After listening to the server expertly run down the menu, I ended up having the shredded duck confit topped with a beautifully seared foie gras and a side of deliciously poached turnip. This was paired with a Gamay from the Loire Valley. Absolutely amazing! My husband had the ribeye, thicker and juicier than he expected, medium rare, and paired with a Joe Beef beer. The accompanying mashed potatoes melted in your mouth, creamy smooth. Dessert was a softserve vanilla icecream with caramel and toasted coconut. Still hung over and smiling from this great dining experience."}
{"text":"A colossal disappoint for the beginning of our epic bachelor weekend in Montreal. My group was so excited to get a reservation at this restaurant and didn't know the sadness that would follow. The menu, first of all, is hidden under a dim light with ineligible cursive writing. Their trick is to let the waitress come over and suggest the plates for you to order. She of course suggests the meals that are either expensive or the food that is probably overdue and they need to get rid of. In our case, we were all poisoned and it ruined our night and the next day as well. Disappointment all around for us. 
I hope \"Joe\" is proud."}
{"text":"This place is exceptionally good!
Geez- I don't know where to begin. Our table of four shared about a dozen dishes. The highlights being the Horse Tartare, a pasta with Fois Gras and deer shoulder, the smoked crispy fried trout, and the New York Strip with blue cheese.
The cocktails were kinda meh.......... but the service and general experience was all on point.
I would visit Joe Beef again in a heartbeat. It's one of the best dining experiences I have had."}
{"text":"Five stars.  Five.  For courtesy, attitude, ambience, and simple good manners.

No, I didn't expect to be writing that, either.  Not after having read the previous reviews here, at least.  But I've been there twice, now, for oysters and a drink after vernissages at Parisian Laundry a few blocks away, and both times I've been quietly treated like Royalty by their barman.  And the oysters have been fresh and delicious.

Don't expect to be able to read the menu, though.  If you need supper there some night, just sit at the bar, and ask the barman to read you his cheat sheet.  You'll be taken care of."}
{"text":"I read about Joe Beef being a must visit place if in Montreal. I was excited about having some Duck made from the duck press they have but was sad they didn't have any duck on the menu. We got the steak for two, steak was a little chewy but the flavor was good. The waiter was awesome and recommended items to us since we couldn't read the menu, it was all in FRENCH! Not the best steak in the world but decent I guess. Their in house beer is good!"}
{"text":"Such a hot spot - but if you dine after 10p - you could get a table last minute. Foie Gras w apple chutney and sauce -- very tasty way to start ur meal --  I was taken aback by Bossy wait staff who dictate your meal and wine choice (so French) - but they seem to know what they are doing as the grub is legit. The beef was the standout of the night (Cote de Boef) - aka ribeye for two w fresh horseradish and pomme frites w spicy aioli and corn w cheese curds - so amazing.  The lobster spaghetti was good but not out of this world -  overall, a good meal. I would lean to 3.5 stars but since that doesn't exist - 4 it is. Would I come back? Maybe with a meathead -- but if you're into anything else- I would prolly venture to Its sister restaurants down the street.  I'm a fan #joebeef but not head over heels in love.  It's takes a lot for me to get there- maybe the next time I'm back in #montreal. Until then, Merci!"}
{"text":"After years waiting finally got a chance to eat here.  Tried Horse Tartare, Belon Oysters, Calamari Stuffed with lobster sausage. For entrees tried the roasted duck and foie gras, lobster spaghetti, bacon wrapped porchetta and escargot.  It was busy, staff was very nice and knowledgeable.  Our food took a while but we understand  it comes with going out on weekend.  Best things were actually horse tartare and porchetta.  Pricing was reasonable.  Chefs could've  made a very big difference by not under or over seasoning rest of meal.  I would go back based on my understanding that this restaurant doesn't try to be more than a fun place to eat first and foremost.   Im very picky so people should make their own minds up."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype for me: 
*the smoked meat croquettes were little salt bombs and a bit one note for me.  The sliced pickles just added to the sodium.
*seemed dingy inside and there were flies in the restaurant, but thought all the knick knacks strewn throughout were nice photo ops
*the horse tartare is phenomenal, loved the shaved matsutakes and the brioche, heavenly.  Best red meat tartare I have ever had.  
*if you must get the lobster pasta, get the half portion, it was just okay, pasta al dente, the shellfish could have been better, heavy, creamy, could have used more fresh herbs and again, a lot of the same flavor
*veal, escargot and bone marrow, impressive looking dish and was more like short rib type meat than a steak-just falls apart.  Very good and very rich.  

Tip: take a photo of the chalkboard and read the menu from your device.  Everyone was struggling and craning their necks.  

It's been rather warm the last week, no AC at JB.  Loved our little window nook booth, but I think the garden would have been a great alternative.

Reasonable pricing $160 CAD for 4 items, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  We were stuffed.  

Great servers and interesting meal, but my least favorite planned meal of the trip."}
{"text":"I went to \"Joe Beef\" for the Beef!
Turned out they only had 3 choices! 
#1 was a veal chop that was pretty good but it's not a steak. 
#2 was something like a 36oz Rib steak for 2....
I love rib steak, it's my favourite cut, but 36oz is a bit too big for just me and I know it would be at least 2\" thick and that tastes more like a roast than a steak. 
#3 was a bone in New York strip or sirloin, whatever you want to call it but I call it the tough side of the T Bone. And it was! I left quit a bit of unchewable fat and gristle on my plate and the cost was $60 before tax for a 2nd or 3rd rate steak. 
Service was very good and very helpful but it's too jammed in and tight for me. But obviously it's fine for a lot of people. 
I'm hoping one day I will go back and they will have a nice 20oz rib steak on the board and I can give that a try."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is a big dude, and his place is larger than life. 

We ate here with friends who are locals on the hottest night of the Montreal summer. Without exaggeration, it was at least 92 degrees (yes, Fahrenheit) inside the restaurant. Despite our sweat and misery, we had a legendary meal. 

But before a few words on the meal, a toast to the real star of the night: the bison in the men's room. What a guy.

OK, the meal: We ordered off the blackboard menu. The tomato salad and cold soup were perfect amid the perspiration. The cocktails, Chilean red and Willamette Valley pinot kept us as cool as could be as a snap thunderstorm pierced the heat and humidity. Then, the beef, and lots of it. 

It's hard to imagine how great this place would be with air conditioning.

Hats off to Mr. Beef and the bison."}
{"text":"How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  

Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  

Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  

Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.

Even the soft serve ice cream was yummy.  A refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  

Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would recommend it to everyone!

I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?

Imagine a mid-life crisis taking place in a tiny New York style restaurant that insists on reservations for the bar (4 stools in the traffic zone to the kitchen) even if the bar is empty? Luckily I did make reservations earlier in the day with a snotty hostess.

Joe Beef is full of the crap I'm guessing Joe's wife said 'no way' to when they combined their belongings 25 years ago in wedlock. 
Maybe they broke up, maybe he finally opened the restaurant of his dreams. Whatever happened, all that stuff is now in an overpriced restaurant in Little Burgandy.
Look, I appreciate fresh ingredients and a menu that changes so quickly that you can't be bothered to print menus, but really? Making your patrons stand in the middle of a tiny dining room, in the way of servers and freaking out seated diners by looming behind them, gawking at a blackboard that is so jam packed with overpriced food and seriously overpriced wine? That's just mean Joe. 

The food was not bad but really, if you cook anything in a stick of butter (steak, potatoes, greens) it will taste just fine.  Either sass up the menu to match the high prices or clear out some of your swag and take a more honest, down home cookin approach to your price list.

Oh and minus three stars for the spoiled 21 year olds running back and forth from the bar to the bathroom doing coke. Ew."}
{"text":"Très bon resto! Très bon service et cozy comme ambiance. Produits du Quebec! Nourriture très riche."}
{"text":"It seems like some people save special reviews for their 100, 200 and so on.  Well, I guess that I felt like joining the club, and I felt that it was appropriate to review my best meal of 2013 for my 100th. You may be thinking to yourself, but \"2013 is not over, how do you know that it was your best meal of the year?\".  Trust me, I know. 

While this was our second visit to Joe Beef on our recent trip to Montreal, to me it really was the whole culmination of our week long stay there.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was the wife's birthday and we were there with great friends.  The only drawback was that the outside patio area was not available on this warm May day in Montreal.  For all we know, it could have been too hot out there for dinner anyway and we may have lucked out.  Next time the patio will be ours. We did, at least have our same fabulous waitress, Morgane.

The menu had changed somewhat since 2 days prior and there were some good additions that were calling my name.  The oeuf en gelee were an immediate choice for my appetizer and the sweetbreads were a slam dunk for my entree.  It's like they knew what I wanted to eat and they made it happen. I can't really vouch for their psychic abilities at Joe Beef, but they nailed this meal for me.  Also, from now on I am getting the bloody mary as my drink since it comes with its own appetizer of raw oyster and crab leg or some other shellfish.

We also ordered the conch fritters for the table, which were a nice surprise. I think that the only other time I had conch was in Key West a long time ago. The others ordered halibut, fois gras double down and another whole fish dish that the name escapes me now. After polishing all that food, dessert seemed again from psychic intervention to be appropriate for the group, Charlotte aux fraise.  Morgane recommended that we order 2 for the table.  We should have probably listened to her.  We also opted for the trio of mini eclairs.  The Charlotte came out with sparklers for the wife's birthday.  Once the sparklers were out, it did not last long.  The eclairs were also tasty.  Morgane was nice enough share some calvados, as a digestif with us, before we left to finish off the meal of the year.

Next time the patio in the back will be ours!"}
{"text":"While the place is authentic and the food is good , but it's supper tiny, with no privacy and the seating is very tight and uncomfortable, the same applies on it's sister the Liverpool House. One other thing ; the owners should finally printed their complicated menu on a peace of paper , not everyone is willing or capable of struggling to pass through the tiny tables , get hit by rushing waiters and wear magnifying glasses in order to see the distant black board with a tiny hand writing listing hundreds of plates, in a very dim lighting , and let's presume one of the group has volunteered to do it, what about the rest, even a couple will struggle with this. The other option is to be obliged to get the help from waiters in a rush, who certainly don't have the time to explain all what's on the menue, that part it self ruins the experience before the overpriced bill comes and destroy it all together"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to give a restaurant a review above 4 stars without having gone more than once or at least tried more than 50% of the menu, but damn.... this 1 dish KILLED IT.  I didn't think I was going to eat lobster spaghetti at a place that has beef in its name, but this is the one dish that doest change from the menu.  it's so freaking good with really well seasoned lobster, pairing perfectly with every spaghetti bite.  and for those that need more savory salt, you can add some nicely cuts lardons to your bite.  

the bar staff/oystet shuckers/waiters were friendly, attentive and warm. 

I'll definitely come back and try to make this $50 dish at home."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant night out ever.  Owners and staff deserve credit for creating an atmosphere and delivering on product.  If you are super lucky Colville Bay oysters are available.  If you are just generally lucky you found your way to Joe Beef."}
{"text":"My first experience here -- as part of a trip with my son before he starts college -- was disappointing, mostly for me.

First of all, right off the bat, just know you are going to spend a lot of money. The entrees here easily cost twice of any other dinner we had on our week-long Canada excursion. Not saying this is a negative, necessarily, but for this kind of pricing, you anticipate having a certain kind of experience.

The place is very bubbly and friendly, very gastropub feeling, with all the dishes written in French on large blackboards. Our waiter patiently, but fairly quickly, went through every single dish with us in English.

We had a choice of three beers -- we picked the IPA, which was on the bitter side.

THE PLUSES: Lively, fun atmosphere. The opener we had -- sort of a jarmon ham dish that my son and I split -- was quite good. My son loved his lobster spaghetti -- he definitely made the much better pick for entree. Easy to get to from the Lionel-Groux station on the Metro, and a nice walk.

THE MINUSES: I ordered the main course steak and it was really fatty. Much too much fat for this kind of price. The fact that they topped the steak with tomato slices made me think afterward that they were trying to cover that up. Maybe not. I am just not used to going to good restaurants and getting a steak with this much fat. Very disappointing. It also took a good 90 minutes (!!) between our arrival at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday night, and when our entrees first arrived. That is just TOO long.

I really expected a better overall experience from Joe Beef."}
{"text":"I hate to do this cause I never do. I'd rather write positive reviews and not be negative. Like I'd rather talk winning war strategies, not losing ones. 

So here's the thing. Danny Meyer, even though you are always right, your wrong here. This is not the best restaurant in North America. 

The horse meat tatar was just that. Horse meat. When I need to ask for some limes that's the death knell of your tartar. Then my date started ordering shots, that 3 bartenders participated in and no one asked me. And the bill came to $160 and we had just ordered 2 appetizers and no main course. 

When things start getting out of control, someone needs to ask the man in control. That's what there are generals on the battlefield!!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Other than my appetizer being a little over seasoned (fresh pasta with venison), I only have good things to say. Our waitress did an excellent job guiding us through a somewhat cryptic menu on the chalk board and the end result was a memorable three course dinner. The next time a friend from out of town asks me where they should eat when they come to Montreal, I'll probably tell them to go to Joe Beef."}
{"text":"Like a well-informed traveler, I make a reservation for my boo and I a few weeks in advance (recommended), and be forewarned that regular dinner hours are most likely booked, so if you're like us, you will most likely find openings in the 9pm and after range. That said, Joe Beef is SO worth it.

At night, the space has an unpretentious romanticism to it: soft lighting, lots of fun and strange decor to gaze at, with the sometimes changing menu written on a large chalkboard on one side of the room. Oh and the best food service staff I've ever encountered. We arrived around our 9:45pm reservation time, and the kind host informs me that our table is still occupied, which was expected. Realizing our wait would be a while, the host thanked us for our patience, took our coats, and another server came by to take our wine order. Finally our server, the wonderful Alexandra came by to welcome us and carefully explain the menu (my boo speaks some French, I speak none). By the time we got to our table, we were a little tipsy and very ready to grub. 

Our order: 

Blue Point Connecticut Oysters - Simple, fresh, delicious. Served with lemon, horseradish, cocktail sauce, and a vinegary sauce on the side. Oh and Joe Beef's own hot sauce. Which, along with a little lemon squeeze, I used to season my little oyster. Perfection.

Breaded Head Cheese  - Great execution, the breading on the head cheese adding a nice texture, sitting on light greens and topped with a mustard seed sauce and tartar sauce. Boo isn't a fan of mustardy or pickley things, but for someone who usually doesn't eat head cheese, I loved it. 

Lobster Spaghetti - Perfectly divided and meaty pieces of lobster with spaghetti pasta in a creamy tomato sauce. Popular for a reason. Kinda wish we had a little bread to go with it. Otherwise, it was the bomb-diggety. 

Vanilla Berry Soft Serve Swirl - Great end to the meal, served with pieces of meringue and cranberries. 

We were one of a few couples who were out on a nice little dinner date, and let me just say that there is something about Joe Beef's ambience and vibe that makes it great for a special night with that special one. 

Alexandra was charming, knowledgeable, and super helpful in our food decision, making sure that we didn't order too much or too little. Towards the end of the evening she shared a little bonus taste of sparkling dessert wine. Her hospitality and down-to-earth attentiveness was so wonderful that we hugged at the end. While the food was some of the best we've ever had, the service blew our experience out of the water. Thanks Alexandra!!!

While Joe Beef ain't the most inexpensive place in the world, it is definitely a place to consider for a special occasion. Can't wait to come back here, hmm... my birthday?"}
{"text":"Joe Beef was fantastic. It reminds me of Le Petit Trois in Los Angeles with 6 times seating capacity and fantastic music that will take you back to your youth (born between 1970-1975) - very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"After an anticipated 4 months wait time, I finally got a 6:15 pm reservation  at this local food Mecca. (I had a reservation for a month ago but it was a  9:15 pm slot- way too late if I'm going to indulge). Mind you,  I saw a man get a seat at the bar with no reservations! So there is a way to bypass the website for 1-2 ppl.

It was an easy walk from the Lionel Groulx metro. I got there at around 5:50 pm - and it was freezing, there was quite a few people waiting outside -the doors strictly opened at 6 pm after what seemed to be a team huddle inside. 

The venue was nice - real cozy, dim lighting with Christmas lights, authentic decor - seafood house vs hunting club? (including hanging trout vs stag head). It was cool to see pictures of \"joe beef\".

The menu changes daily that could explain the crammed up bad hand writing on a chalk board that you could barely make out in low lighting. Even with a snapped picture -everything is written in French with no space for item descriptions. It's kind of overwhelming-so your only bet is your server explaining the menu, why not get printed menus?

My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers: 2 entrées, dessert and a cup of tea totaling to 66$ per person. All items were enough to share for 2 ppl- Amazing deal for that much food! The wine selection was quite vast and can easily add up the bill!

Rating on 5 stars: I don't have exact names of items from memory , so I may be off with some ingredients) all these dishes were good to share for 2 ppl.
Appetizers: prices around 15$-17$ per item
-venison tartar ***(comes served inside a lightly toasted piece of bread topped with an egg. The tartar was well seasoned, not too gamey, with the broken egg that complimented it so well); goat cheese croquette? ****(absolutely loved this dish, that came as a ball of finely cut potatoe strips/topped with a baked goat cheese, in a light butter-like sauce) 
Entrees: prices start around 20$ and up..
pork chop ***(came with a side of mushrooms with a hint of cilantro. The pork chop was really tender but there was a lot of fat); famous lobster spaghetti ****(what seemed like 1/2 lobster in a reach butter cream sauce, pretty heavy - good to have as a main course on its own)
Dessert: was frankly disappointing- but I get it , this is not suppose to be its forté! We had a flakey pastry crust filled with chocolate mousse, whip cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Pass on dessert for a glass of their fine wine.

I ended my hearty meal with a cup of warm chai tea. Glad I got to try a part of the rave. Am I likely to come back? Most certainly- but hopefully in the summer -when the back garden has opened up!"}
{"text":"Food Excellent 
Music is my genre and I love it . 
Young and fun definitely a Montréal hot spot !
My waiter at the bar was excellent and helpful, all staff was friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"This was a highlight of our trip. Food, service, and atmosphere were all amazing. Make a reservation a month in advance, or take your chances like we did and get seated right away due to a last minute cancelation."}
{"text":"The quality of this restaurant is touching upon Michelin 1 star if you order the right things. Overall I am very impressed with this restaurant. 

The Good:
The signature pasta is a must have. 
Traditional french cuisine
Exotic looking foods
Seasonal

The Meh:
The steaks are pretty much the same compared to other high end steak houses like \"the keg\". The multi layer colored dessert thingy is pretty mediocre. 
Raw oysters"}
{"text":"Very very disappointIng ! Uncomfortable! We were seated at a table that would comfortably seat 4 but we were 6 people and were very uncomfortable. The appetizers of white smoked salmon, oysters and a salad were nothing special with the best one bring an average salad. Two of the main courses were good, a trout and a chicken. The other four people ordered the 18 ounce steak. All four people did not like the taste of the steak, the way it was seasoned and the quality. The steaks were mainly uneaten. The waitress asked if we wanted the steaks wrapped up - we said no we didn't like the steaks. She did nothing, did not offer anything else or call a manager. The wine was the best thing that was consumed that evening by 4 of the 6 people. The bill was presented and there was nothing taken off the bill despite 4 uneaten meals. Not impressed. Overrated. 
Customer service uncaring . Thumbs down !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have gotten a reservation via DINR. If you reserve through the actual Joe Beef website, it is booked a few months out. We got there at 630 on a Thursday and the place was packed. We were seated at a tiny table which had very little space between other tables. It was cramped. The inside was dark and stuffy. The menu was written on a blackboard tucked in a dark corner with words i could hardly decipher. I felt frustrated for not being able to review the menu. We had to rely on our server. She was so awesome but i still would have wanted to review the menu by myself to determine what i wanted to eat that  night given the options. Anyway, we went with our server's recommendations on what to order based on the lobster spaghetti dish we had set our mind on. The smoked meat croquettes came in 4 teeny tiny pieces for $15. I thought it was overpriced. The stuffed quail was good. We also had 2 oysters each and 1 scallop each, all very fresh. For our main course, we shared the lobster spaghetti which was delightful. The lemon tart for dessert was too sour for me. The bill was around $180 including tip. Personally, i wasn't blown away by the overall experience. I felt cramped the whole night, couldn't get out of my seat without the fear of toppling over the drinks of the ones beside us. The food took forever to come out...i would say around 45 min just for the oysters to come out which don\"t even need to be cooked. Dining for me is not just about the food but the overall experience and unfortunately it wasn't what i was expecting."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to eat here, so when I got the opportunity to do so I was super ecstatic. Keep in mind that you will probably need to make reservations several weeks and possibly months in advance depending on when you want to eat there. The  atmosphere was warm and inviting, the dining area was actually bigger than it looked, and there is also an outdoor patio area. Overall, the food we ordered was mind-blowingly delicious. All the flavors were very well balanced and seasoned nicely. Food here is on the heavier side and very rich because the dishes are mostly meat based. Our server was excellent, very informative, and attentive to our needs. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience in Montreal, this place far exceeded my expectations. I would be thrilled to return if given the chance."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite restaurant in Montreal, ranked only below it's sister restaurant, Liverpool House. Before I get into my review, first, a confession. I came here, too, because of Anthony Bordain. I am not proud of it, I wish I was a cool-kid Montreal-er, but alas I am merely a uni-lingual American.  In fact, my boyfriend and I designed a whole vacation around getting a reservation at Joe Beef. 

The atmosphere: Joe Beef is simultaneously sexy and casual. It has dark mood lighting, but hockey memorabilia decor. They play Neil Young and French singers I do not recognize. Your plates and glasses are mismatched, and appear to come from a cool thrift store. The bar is boisterous-  ladies cackling, men singing, loud debates amounting, etc. ( an example from our dinner: whether Americans are bigger prudes than Canadians). The staff are irreverent and knowledgeable. Almost all of them seem to have a gleam of mischievous in their eyes. 

The Food: I ordered some sort of lamb sausage plate, the cocktail of the day (x3), and PEI oysters. My other half ordered the pheasant and wine. We were both very happy. If I had to describe the food, I'd say it was decedent,and intense. My lamb dish was so huge, it presented like a dare. It wasn't prepared like your usual lamb, in that it was not Mediterranean inspired. It actually reminded me a lot of the food I ate in Prague - made to keep you full and warm. It had a dark aroma - of spices I did not recognize but enjoyed. The Oysters were meaty and briny, and served with a very spicy homemade hot sauce. 

The star of our night was desert, Marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake). It was the best desert I've ever had in my life. For those Anthony Bordain fans morjolaine was featured in the No Reservations, Quebec episode. There is also a recipe for it in Joe Beef's cookbook. 

Anyways, making a pilgrimage to Joe Beef should definitely be on any foodie's vacation itinerary. The food, atmosphere, and service were wonderful. I felt right at home in my comfy booth, tearing through animal parts and slogging beer."}
{"text":"This is my perfect restaurant, food is decadent and unbelievably delicious. We had dinner last May and I still remember what we had and how phenomenal it was. I also liked that the decor is casual, so you can just release the fat kid in you and go to town. 

An absolute must, unless you hate life."}
{"text":"Knowing that we were going to spend a night in Montreal, my PIC (partner in crime) mentioned Joe Beef.  I Yelped it, tried to get a table, no luck.  
So I did a little research and found out that the best way to get a table is to call.  I was so happy to snag a reservation for a Saturday night diner.  
As soon as we arrived, we were seated and were promptly attended to.  

The restaurant isn't small but it's divided into a couple of dinning rooms and it's quite snug.  The decor is unique.  The menu is written on chalk boards that are posted but wasn't very easy to read because of the lighting and the angle we were sitting at, but our waiter went through the entire menu - he was very helpful. 
We ended ordering 3 appetizers- the sea urchin with the jalapeño aioli, Headcheese croquettes and the Scottish egg wrapped in smoked eel.  All the appetizers were good. For our main dishes we ordered the famous Lobster spaghetti, the sweetbreads with a side of foie gras and fries. 
The lobster spaghetti was \"ordinary\" IMO, nothing special about it and the sweetbreads had no flavor.  I was disappointed with both main courses.  
Overall, Joe Beef is a great place to gather with good friends, have drinks and to share plates.  Reservations are highly recommended - be prepared for a wait and not much elbow space."}
{"text":"Where do I start? This place was exceptional. Joe Beef has had a lot of attention because it's great but also because Bourdain has made mention of it many times when he talks about Montreal. You should not expect to walk in and get a table, yes that is how in demand this place is in the restaurant scene. My friend Matt was committed to getting in to this place during our guys weekend to Montreal alas NO RESERVATIONS. We decided to call Joe Beef a couple of hours before they opened and please our border crossing, meat loving, fine dining case to whoever would listen. After a bit of persuasion we were accommodated with a table that the staff described as a low table and not that exciting. It would turn out to be, in my opinion, the nicest place in the restauarant. They have a concrete patio table and benches in the middle of their garden in the back of the restaurant. It was a casual affair so it was perfect. We had not been there before so we asked our server to bring us (5 guys) the menu you think we should have and we will go with that. From the GIANT steak, salad, oysters, and so on it was really good on every level. A lot of there menu is seasonal so I will not dive in to specifics because it will be different and updated possibly when you get there. If you have an opportunity i would recommend you check it out. Bourdain did not miss the mark on this place and whenever I am within range I will try to talk them in to giving me a table for dinner."}
{"text":"Joe beef was wonderful, the first meal as soon as we reach Montreal! Although it was too dark to see anything, especially menu in French, we went with the server's recommendations. We had the foie gras with ham as appetizer, follow with two mains which we settled on 1.5 lbs lobster spaghetti and the steak. It was wonderful, especially the lobster spaghetti, the flavor of the sauce was full of the freshness from lobster yet creamy which compliment well with both the lobster and spaghetti. Next was the steak, it was again very very good, especially the fatty part of the steak, it literally melts in your mouth! For a group of four girls, we could only fit one appetizer and two mains as the dishes in Joe Beef is very rich in flavors and super filling! It was memorable and I hope to try again next time I go to Montreal, perhaps a different dish, but I probably have to bring a French dictionary and a flash light!"}
{"text":"Updated Review:  I have taken some time to step away after my experience and give what I feel is an honest, critical, and logical review.  I am trying to approach this from a logical perspective and remove any brash and quick emotional response.

Joe Beef... an establishment that is beyond well regarded and coveted by many who enjoy unique dining experiences.  Unfortunately, the experience fell short for me.  It may have been the hype from friends, the consistent and raving reviews from well respected critics, and perhaps just the level of anticipation that left me looking for more.

We spent a week in Montreal and made the rounds to the cities must do spots.  I'll be frank, my French is beyond poor and I usually outwardly express my lack of the language.  For 6 nights we didn't face a single issue, we were met with respect and were offered either English menus or someone well versed in the English language.

Service is important and Joe Beef fell short.  Our waiter, a tall bald gentleman (with forearm tattoos) fell short.  He was quick, disingenuous and it appeared he was bothered we did not speak French.  The menu and wine list was not covered, it received a quick \"check it out and ask if you have any questions\".  This is direct contradiction to the couple sitting at the bar, English speaking Americans who received a thorough and spirited review of the menu by the bartender.  I should have spoke up and asked for a new waiter, that is my fault.  I know that these things happen, the place can't be perfect all the time.  I'm just disappointed it came on the last night of our stay after a week of nothing but perfect service.

We made a wine selection from the available wines by glass, no complaints and a nice glass.  The oysters were wonderful, a nice selection of West Coast and PEI varieties.  Our entrees fell short.  My wife had the leg of lamb.  Overall she enjoyed the dish but it lacked some depth as a dish.  A slab of meat with simple peas was not what we expected but it was still a decent dish.  

I choose the Lobster and Spaghetti, which is regarded as a classic amongst many reviewers.  Unfortunately I found myself wanting more in the dish.  The lobster was cooked perfectly as was the pasta but the sauce itself was rather simple and boring.  I had read in the past this dish was served with a delicate lobster bisque sauce, perhaps they changed this up.  It lacked depth, flavor, and added very little to the dish.  As a New England-er I eagerly awaited this dish, I wanted to see how a new city would handle a classic meal from my home.  As a dish it was certainly edible but I would never order it again, especially at the price of 50 CAD.  

Update:  I received a voice mail from the manager of Joe Beef regarding my experience and poor review here on Yelp.  I appreciate them reaching out.  I've yet to decide if I will speak to them regarding the matter.  Unfortunately I am 5 hours from Montreal and that would be quite the trip to give it another go.  If I find myself in Montreal again I'll certainly be coming to Joe Beef again I'll just make sure to have a waitstaff member who delivers what they are supposed to do."}
{"text":"I honestly loved my supper! I went there with my boyfriend's birthday we had oysters, lobster spaghetti and the duck with foie gras on the top! i LOVED the duck!! crispy skin with tender juicy meat! I agree that somethings maybe overpriced, but the food is good. The quality and taste is simply delicious! The bill was not as bad as I expected it to be. I would defiantly recommend trying it at least once. The only thing I wish they did differently was writing the menu on both sides of the room. Instead of having it written on only on one side. I was sitting my back to the chalkboard, which means i had to keep getting up to see the menu, pretty inconvenient.But other than that good atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"IncreIBLE!!!! Incredible. Delicious. Phenomenal. Exceptional. The vibe, the restaurant. Nelson behind the bar! Every staff member/server was exceptional in service and the food was a cut above. So good so good so good. Can't wait to go back. Friendly. Beautiful. Merci merci merci bocu!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner. Friendly servers that know the menus well. Which helped because I don't know how to read the French menu. I ordered the 'cowboy steak',  it was the best steak I had. The steak was decent sized, thick, crispy outside,  soft juicy inside,  paired with a dijon sauce to perfection. A bit pricy,  but definitely worth it. Must try. Wouldn't mind having it everyday if I can afford it."}
{"text":"What can I say- completely lived up to the hype. Best pasta of my life (lobster spaghetti), and I love pasta."}
{"text":"Made reservations 3 months ago for 4 people and it wasn't worth it at all!

1. Food took an hour to come out

2. One persons food came first before the other 3 and sat there for about 5-6 minutes.

3. My father ordered medium rare and it came out medium 

4. I ordered medium and it came out well done.

5. I asked to return it, which I never do and they asked me if I was sure I didn't want to eat it. OF COURSE I didn't want it, it was well done!

6. It then took 15minutes to get my new steak to come out. It was okay, but not great. It was a rib eye that tasted more like a roast. It was served with horseradish and HP sauce (C'MON! HP Sauce)

7. At the end of the meal they didn't offer anything for making all of us wait and for ruining my meal. No complimentary anything, no apologies from chef, from manager... Nothing. 

8. We then mentioned to our waitress that we were really disappointed with everything and she said we should have asked for something in return. Well it's her job and the restaurants job to offer that. 

Either way, not worth it, much better places out there

Won't go back or recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing food, courteous service, lovely evening ambience. One of Montreal's top-rated restaurants and you can be assured that it's for a reason!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It epitomizes everything you would want in a restaurant named Joe Beef and combines it with impeccable service, awesome attitude and a great ambiance.  

Joe Beef isn't a large space (I believe there are two sides) so reservations are a must.  We had a party of 8 reserved into two groups of 4, but the hostess didn't drop a beat when we told her 2 in our party were delayed.  She seated us in an awesome table for 6 but most importantly paired us with one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  

She clearly saw that we were tourists, but that's one thing that I loved about Montreal.  Many of the cool places that we went to, they welcome and are friendly to tourists and this place was no different.  It looked like it was full of French Canadians, but you couldn't tell as they effortlessly switched from English to French catering to their customer.  

The menu is a revolving one and written only on the chalkboard nightly, so describing the dishes accurately is almost impossible.  Suffice it to say everything was amazing and it was easily one of the best meat-centric meals I've had in my life.  I was in heaven.  

We started off with drinks and I never saw a cocktail menu but the waitress was able to order everyone drinks they loved based on just a brief description of base drink preference (ie: gin, vodka, etc.)  The drinks are strong and tasty and while perhaps not as complex as the artisinal cocktails we had at Lab just before, they were good.  I had no idea how much they cost either.  

Then we started off with appetizers.  She knew we were familiar with the famous Foie Gras double down but informed us they no longer sold it.  She saw our sad faces and said would order a selection that would make us happy.  Our waitress never pushed any item (ie: their oysters are famous, but we didn't feel like any) and it really was one of the most fun and engaging ordering experiences I've had.  

Foie Gras Small Bites - deep fried and filled with tiny bits of foie gras and potato.  Delicious.  This place knows meat, fried, and smoked.

Mozzarella served with Toast - fresh mozzarella cheese sliced and served with toast.  A nice change and balance to all the meat.

Sunnyside up Duck Eggs with Pomme Frites - I've never had eggs this good and I've sous vide many eggs. This was better.  It was super rich, seasoned perfectly and the fries were amazing.

Foie Gras And Ham Sandwich - this was to make up for the double down.  Split 6 ways, we each only got a small bite, but the salty foie gras sauce and milder ham went with the decant biscuit bread with sauce.  

Puff Pastry with Smoked Turkey - our waitresses favorite appetizer.  It was good but tasted a bit like turkey with small bread puffs.  Not interesting enough.

Minced Duck and Seared Foie Gras - the duck looked like a steak but broke into parts of duck meat.  The seared foie gras on top was delicious and the berry sauce was a perfect contrast.  

Venison Sausage - loved it.  Did I say they do meats well?

Lobster Spaghetti - another famous dish.  Whole lobster with cream sauce and perfect al dente noodles.  One of my favorites of the night.  

Seared Rib Eye Steak - seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, finished completely.

Horse Meat Filet Mignon - wrapped with bacon and served with potatoes.  This was a novelty as I've never had horse meat.  Cooked perfectly medium rare the meat was delicious and a very different texture than any meat I've had.  Worth trying once.  

Deep Fried Cauliflower - covered in cheese but an obligatory vegetable.

Lamb Steak - yet another meat, cooked so perfectly and completely different flavor.  

Duck Fat Fries - the perfect starch to complement the meat.  

We were too full from drink and food for dessert but finished our meal with laughter with the staff learning French phrases, sharing the best spots for food and merriment and finishing with shots on the house.  

Our bill wasn't cheap but the final price was less than I guessed.  It also was one of the best meat meals I've had in my life.  I missed Au Pied du Cochon but I don't think I would have wanted to trade away Joe Beef.  

Joe Beef accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"Strolled in at 10 on a particularly wild night. Had the oysters, foie gras, steak, lobster spaghetti, and an embarrassing amount of wine and champagne. Loud and drunk, yes we were Those people. Despite that, the service was great. Our bill was horrendous, and my memory is foggy from that night but from what I can remember the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Overpriced sell out. 
All meat. And just ok.  No great favors. 
We had trout spretzel and blood sausage. 
Sausage was good trout was ok at best. Bland and normal. 
Rabbit slider was good. Some taste in the mustard. 
Had the 'bone marrow' pate which had pre mixed bone marrow and other good things , made a paye, and presented it back in a bone. 

One of the Joe beef guys was at the bar, should he have been in the kitchen?

No emphasis on local. 
No veggies. 
Isn't it tomato season?

Very disappointing. 
Wine was great. Oysters great 

Joe beef books and sauces adorning all parts of the block. It's bubba Gump shrimp. Not a 5 star place or close.

Fucking disappointing.  And overpriced."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with the salt?  Ordered the steak main course with side of fries.  Could not believe how salty it was....

Enjoyed the oysters the most.  But even with this, found bits of shell in my last oyster. 

Too much hype.  Was an early fan but, for what you pay for, not going back.."}
{"text":"Great steak and burgers. Make sure you book a reservation as it is pretty jammed. service and food all is great"}
{"text":"I was told by friends and friends of friends to try Joe Beef. I made a reservation online using their website. For a Wednesday night for 2 I found a 7:30 and a 9:30, we opted for the 9:30 so we could fit in two dinners. 

Food was great, service was great, small, intimate restaurant."}
{"text":"Clearly, based upon the prior reviews of this place, Joe Beef is as polarizing as cilantro.  Unfortunately, I'm in the camp that didn't care for it at all.  I generally don't have such a huge problem waiting a few minutes for a reservation, but this place doesn't get it.  There is virtually no space at all to wait inside the restaurant, so you're either waiting on the sidewalk or packed in like sardines by the tiny bar.

We opted to be cramped by the bar with no seats and watched the bartender/oyster shucker cut his finger while trying to open one of the oysters.  Ok, so he can't shuck an oyster, but what made it worse was that he proceeded with finishing the order without cleaning up his bloody finger.  Shortly thereafter, said shucker then smelled another recently shucked oyster, made a face, poured out the liquor and put it on the tray.  Needless to say, I was passing on the oysters.

After watching that horror show for about a 45 minutes (we had a 9:15 reservation and were seated about 10:00) we were finally seated against the wall with the chalkboard menu.  (We asked for a seat in the courtyard, and were told that we were getting one - their response was, \"oh, sorry about that.  no seats outside.\") 

Fine, since my wife couldn't see the menu, and doesn't speak french, we asked the server for some help.  Some people at the bar were sharing what looked like a veal chop with fiddlehead ferns - he said that it was a lamb shank and that it was spectacular.  We thought he knew what he was talking about.

Given the late hour and the fact that we were grossed out by the oyster debacle, we skipped on starters.  Fast forward another hour.  I try to summon our server to ask where our food was.  His answer - well, your order didn't go in right away since you didn't order an appetizer.  Seriously?  It's 11pm, bring me my dinner that I ordered an hour ago.

The food came, and it was not the same thing as what the guys at the bar ordered.  It tasted fine, but at that point, I was so disenchanted that I couldn't even enjoy it.  One thing that stood out was that it was a little too gamey.  My wife wound up eating some fiddlehead ferns for dinner since she couldn't get over the gaminess of the lamb.  The server came back to apologize and brought us dessert on the house - but who cared at that point.

If I could give this place negative stars for my overall experience I would."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved it! Ok so the chalkboard menu and wine list are a little inconvenient but the food makes up for it. I had the best lamb shoulder roast (for two) with a side if polenta. I wanted to cry because we couldn't finish it. The meat was so tender, gives falling off the bone a new meaning. Apps of raw oysters and gnocchi were also hard to beat. Will definitely go back for more Joe Beef!"}

bloody caesar was delicious

All AMAZING"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I wrote a review but I've been busy enjoying life.  Anyways, here goes a review of a highly recommended restaurant I went in Montreal earlier this month.  I came with a friend I haven't seen since college so needless to say, there was a lot we had to catch up on.

The setting is quite intimate but it didn't hinder a good conversation.  What we didn't like was the menu.  It is a blackboard hung up high in the wall and written in French only.  The handwriting was like a doctor's prescription and the blackboard was not properly erased so it made reading the menu immensely difficult (not to mention I didn't bring my glasses or read French).

I thought the service was ok.  My friend thought our server was a little pretentious.  Anyhow, at least they offered to sell me a half portion of their famous lobster spaghetti.  That allowed me to enjoy some oysters and Canadian sea urchin (uni) as appetizer.  It would be too much food otherwise.  Taste-wise, everything was on par and predictable.

It is a pricey place so do save it for a special occasion.  Reservation necessary."}
{"text":"Delivers on it's promise. In a party of four - 4 appetizers + 4 mains - every single dish was great. Plus 2 of us had the leftovers today - and it made for a killer lunch. AND - we are still snacking on the leftover fries and Brussels sprouts right now."}
{"text":"I lived for 14 years in Lyon, France, arguably the gastronomic capital of Western Europe, so I know fine dining. What I love about Joe Beef is its decadence and, even, irreverence. I've eaten there 3 times in the past 18 months, and each time the experience was a delight for my taste buds (if a little hard on my ears).

My last visit, at the beginning of November, was as pleasurable as previously. The service is always excellent, with staff ready to explain the menu and make recommendations. You really need the explanations because the chalk board menu just doesn't do the dishes justice. The problem is that, once you've had the full description, you'll want to have everything!

I went with the eel nuggets, which made me think of seaside treats or a Dickens novel. Read Michael U's review for the perfect description. Suffice to say, they were delish. However, they were perhaps not the ideal starter to follow with guinea fowl stuffed with foie gras.

I've said in other reviews that I like strong-tasting meats. Guinea fowl is more than chicken and less than duck, and more succulent than turkey. I couldn't finish this divinely yummy dish (picture me saying \"mmm\" with every mouthful), but it was just as good, if not better, (since I wasn't full from the eel), at lunchtime the next day. Other posh-ish restos might frown at a doggy bag, but Joe Beef staff know it's all about the taste experience and offer it before you can ask.

A tip to get a table without booking way in advance: pop in and ask."}
{"text":"Small place in a up and coming area of Montreal.  Food was spectacular, I had the lobster spaghetti, but I sampled from everyone's plate.  Perks to being a fast eater.   

Best drink, The Bloody Caesar, it's meal of its own, and yes I said meal.

A few negative things that prevent a five star rating is the service and wine selection.   

It took the waiter 15 mins to come to our table.  Once there, he was very helpful in explaining the menu which is written on a chalkboard and is in French.  

Overall, I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"We recently had an amazing getaway to Montreal and had a recommendation to go to Joe Beef. Seeing as its in the top of Canada's best restaurants and we love food. We went on our last night(with a reservation) and anyone we spoke to said we were definitely in for a treat. We were so excited to see what our night held. When we arrived, we were told that we didn't have a reservation. Yikes!!  She checked and unfortunately my husband had mistakenly made it for the following week. Our hearts sank but she told us that she would fix it for us. We waited a couple of minutes and then she came back to take us to sit at the bar.  What a relief!  It's a cool and quirky place that has the menu written on a chalkboard because the menu is based on what's currently available. The tables are close together and the seats were all full but it still felt cozy. The guy behind the bar introduced himself as \"David, the English menu\". He translated and explained the whole menu for us. There were so many options that it was hard to decide. However, we did know that we wanted to have the lobster spaghetti. We started with the Montreal-smoked Meat croquettes, grilled asparagus with shaved white ham and cheese and smoked Arctic char. The portions were perfect and everything was delicious. The spaghetti was incredible and not a drop was wasted. After all, that's what bread is for. Even after all that food, we still had room for dessert. The fresh baked madeleines with lemon cream sauce for dipping. As they say, oh mom Dieu!!  We had the best time. The staff are incredible and fun and the food exceeded every expectation we had. Be prepared to spend some money (worth every penny)and make sure to book a reservation at least 2-3 weeks in advance (double check that you have the right date). We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"buildup might be a curse for Joe Beef.  I've been fortunate to dine at several semi famous restaurants and my experience shows they can be hit or miss.  with Joe Beef, here are my thoughts:

Pros:
1. Cool environment
2. Great service
3. Owner was very friendly and treated us to a nice glass of wine and great conversation while we waited for a table.  Really, super grateful to him.

Cons:
1. No printed menus OR menus with English translation.  yeah, I get it, Montreal, part of Quebec.  Still, seems aggressive when a big portion or the folks there were American. The menu is printed on one chalk board in small print and in French.
2. The food was really just OK.  We asked our server for suggestions based on our preferences and he said they had tuna for the only time this year.  We ordered that and also a hanger steak.  Somehow the tuna and the steak had the same dark caper sauce.  The sauce was overpowering for the rather thin piece of tuna which was overcooked."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need another 5 star review, but it deserves it. Smoked meat croquettes- amazing. Horse tartare, amazing. The mains were the weakest part, but still pretty good. The wine was incredible, the waitress charming and friendly, but the best part of the whole meal was the dessert- choux pastries with violet cream. Epic!"}
{"text":"Quoi dire? Cet endroit possède un hype incroyable et une réputation mondiale. Je crois que c'est justifié. Les chefs sont créatifs, c'est certain, mais aussi d'incroyable techniciens qui connaissent les classiques et savent les réinventer. Vous ne trouverez jamais rien de farfelue ici, par respect pour la clientèle. L'ambiance est casual style pub, et cela fait gagner des points. C'est un \"grand\" resto qui n'a pas la prétention des \"grands\" restos, tout est vrai et axé sur ce qui est important. 

C'est un reste à l'image de Montréal, un endroit emblématique a rendre jaloux les touristes.

Il faut s'y prendre d'avance pour une table ou être chanceux à la dernière minute. S'assoir au bar est un must."}
{"text":"If you haven't gone, you should.
It's one of those bucket list places - it's on every chef's favourite restaurant list for a reason.
I'm a huge lover of good food and this is one of those places that will have you spending a lot of money at the end of the night but you won't regret it.
The service is incredible and they try to make your experience there one of a kind.
It's hard to recommend any particular dish because the menu is constantly changing but if you dare.....yes, you need to try the Double Down.     I'm a huge foie gras lover and this beast does not disappoint in flavour and decadence."}
{"text":"After glowing remarks from Anthony Bourdain, my fiance and I knew we had to give it a go.  Not only am I in awe by their awesome wait staff, the simple yet rustic ambiance completes the chill vibes all throughout. 

We visit yearly and each time we've gone, we have a great experience. 

On with the food: The double down (fois gras), the rabbit, duck, lobster spaghetti!! are all rich in flavor, thick in sauce but each morsel melts in your mouth. Get the oysters, try their beer and enjoy your company. You'll love the experience. (One last thing, know that you'll be spending a couple of hundreds, it's not even moderate in price but well worth it)."}
{"text":"Anniversary Year number 3 was celebrated at Joe Beef. Oh how we have now set the bar high! For starters: Make reservations well in advance. Luckily I knew this going in, since the hubs does business in Montreal often. The service was great, the menu, all in French and written on a chalkboard...that part was...difficult. It didn't matter. The waitress asks us, \"Do you trust me?\" and my first instinct was to say \"No...\" but knowing the reputation of the place, I figured there wasn't too far we could stray before having something pretty mind blowing...so we agreed and so opened Pandora's Box of gluttony...

For Starters: Oysters & Clams. All were absolutely delicious and I don't think I could pick a favorite, (or remember the names) if i tried. Shortly after came the onslaught of gluttony...next dish was Beef & Veal tongue with truffle shavings a parsley pesto and topped with watercress. I am not a fan of gamey tasting things and I fear that this dish definitely falls into that category. It was well masked by the parsley and the fresh watercress flavors, but overall, I just don't think tongue is my thing. Then, the waitress brought a truly punishing concoction: the double down fois gras. The Joe Beef chefs are being cheeky with this one. Do you remember KFC's \"sandwich\" where the \"bread\" was two pieces of fried chicken? yeah, well that's this dish...two pieces of fried fois gras sandwiched in the middle was aged cheddar and smoked bacon. It was PURE heaven / heart attack on a plate. 

For our main entrees, the waitress brought the Lobster Spaghetti & the New York Strip with sliced tomato and fresh horseradish. The Lobster Spaghetti landed in front of my face and I swear I could hear a choir of angels singing \"AHHHHH\" and that light came streaming from the heavens...goodness gracious...that plate was something to behold!!! The lobster meat was ever so generously mixed in the heavy creamy pasta. The flavors of the pasta were mild. Not in the sense that it was under-flavored...no quite the opposite...more in a sense that the person creating this dish understood the benefit of restraint. The flavors were luscious...velvetty...ever so rich but somehow not too heavy.  The lobster was so sweet & fresh and buttery. Thank you Frenchies for not being shy with your butter. My tastebuds will never be the same after this dish. It was a life changing dish. Every star of those 5 is well earned solely for this dish and this dish alone. I cannot think of a better way to spend 49 dollars or whatever the price was. It is WELL worth every penny and THEN SOME. The steak was plenty good, nicely cooked, all old school with it's tomato and horseradish. Ron Swanson would approve. But it's just a steak. If you need any further convincing on which to chose, GET THE LOBSTER SPAGHETTI. Just do it. I expect thank you gifts & songs of praise. ;-)

No room for dessert. No way Jose. No need. I am drooling thinking of you, Lobster Spaghetti. You will go down in my list of most memorable culinary experiences to date!"}
{"text":"I love Anthony Bourdain, and one of his TV shows featured Joe Beef. Its a very popular restaurant and you gotta book this place months in advance, so I was really excited when I got a last minute same day reservation...but unfortunately I only liked this place, I didn't love it...its definitely overrated and a victim of its own success. 3.5 Stars.

The rustic space is hipster casual and packed with a few too many tables crammed in, and definitely not romantic. At all. That's okay, I'm cool with that, I know its more about the food here than ambiance, but the diners to the left and right of us were way too close. The waitress's and busboy's butts were both very nice, but their derriers nearly knocked over wine glasses since the tables are so crammed together. Their butts are literally resting on your table as they deliver and remove plates from your table or your neighbors' table. Following on that, its loud in here. Really loud. Between all the voices and the music it was hard to talk with my lovely wife(This might be a good thing if your relationship is on the fritz). Besides their nice butts, the waitress and busboy were both super friendly...but overworked. These two, and the bartender, were trying to cover 7 tables and 8 bar stools that were rarely empty. The poor couple next to us were ignored for at least 20 minutes(we tried to keep them some company). The food comes out relatively fast, but the wait staff just can't keep up with the kitchen staff. Expect a 2+ hour dining experience, and don't plan on catching a show or movie afterwards. 

Joe Beef was gonna be the big splurge of my 8 night Canadian vacation. But the cheapest wine bottle was $45, which is a bit high for a hipstery casual venue. Whatever, the waitress hooked us with a nice bottle of white since they were out of the $45 and $50 options, but still only charged us $50. Only $50...
$3.50 Oysters...fresh and delicious! We only ordered 3, but they still gave us all the extras. 
$14 Lobster meatball pastry...awesome! Or I thought at least, the wife was not impressed with the lobster meatball, but I liked it. We both loved the creamy lobster sauce, and ordered extra bread($2.5 btw) to soak up and chomp on that deliciousness. 
$35 Lobster Spaghetti...my pick, and I found it very good, and a good value! The lobster cream sauce was rich and light at the same time, somehow, and worked well with the al dente spaghetti and generous lobster portions. At $26 in American dollars this was a great value in that sense. 
$41 Seabass...not so impressive. It was generous piece of seabass, but lacked flavor and the tomato based sauce was bland...maybe they were counting on freshness to pull the dish through? Nope. Sad Wife = Sad Life. Don't order this.
$11 15 layer cake. Or is it 11 layers? 13? I don't know, but this was pretty good overall, though too thin and dry for my tastes. Its a mix of vanilla, chocolate, and I think hazelnut. It was around 10:15pm, so maybe it had been sitting out a bit too long. It probably tasted better at 8:00pm. 

With taxes and tip, the final bill came out to just over $200+ Canadian dollars. My wife was relieved that this was more like $160ish in American dollars, thank gawd! Due to the overworked staff, it took us 20 some minutes just to get and pay the bill. Do I regret eating at Joe Beef? No, but I was disappointed and not sure if I will bother coming back...maybe...and maybe we should've ordered one beef entree in place called \"Joe Beef\".  Maybe."}
{"text":"Steak was spectacular - i still dream about it. Melted like butter. However, when they charge you $6 for a bottle of tap water and aggressively kick you out after 2 hours because your time is up, that tells me that I will never go back..."}
{"text":"Reserved my table at least 2 months ahead. I was really looking forward to my dinner! I was not disappointed!

There's no actual menu. Everything is listed on a chalkboard. This is a bit inconvenient, as people sitting at the banquet won't be able to read it. So we actually have to move around to read what's on the menu and then go back to your seat. Since their menu changes, I suppose it's the best way for them... not for customers though.

The service was great! All along, they made sure that everything was fine. They would change our plates/utensils between each dish to make our tasting experience better without contamination!

Food was good! As entree, i tried the seared scallop and the smoke meat croquette. Both was amazing! As the main dish, of course we took the lobster spaghetti, it's as good as you can imagine! However, to eat that plate alone, I probably won't be able to finish it. The sauce was a but heavy. Also tried the deer neck with foie gras. I was disappointed with that dish. It was way too salty. Only took 2-3 bites and couldn't take it anymore. When you eat it along with some foie gras, the saltiness is a bit less bad... 
as of the dessert, it was amazing! Orange farci avec Five Alive. Basically sorbet in an orange with marshmallow on top! Very refreshing (especially after all the salt ingested...)! Was definitely a good pick!"}
{"text":"celebrate our anniversary today and love the food there. my hubby booked table 3 months ago and it worthed waiting. we ordered fois gras?pork chop and steak. they are delicious."}
{"text":"What is it guys ... Bourdain? Finished eating here and everything was ... .. ..... fine."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner. Went here to celebrate graduation with my girlfriend. I had a perfectly cooked Rib Steak. It was quite large and very filling. The service was very friendly. The menu was a little hard to read since it was on a chalkboard. Overall, this was one of the best steaks I've had in my life. I would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"F'ing ridiculous.

How does one make lobster spaghetti with that much flavor?

Eel nuggets were a bit lacking, but overall, there are 95% 5-star dishes and 5% 4-star dishes."}
{"text":"I have to admit...I was a bit skeptical of Joe Beef when I was planning our food adventure in Montreal. We had 6 days and a ton of must try restaurants on our list...Toque, Olive + Gourmando, Bocata, Le Club Chasse Et Peche, Au Pied Cochon and Maison Boulud to name a few. Joe Beef barely made it into our plans on our last night in Montreal but I am SO glad it did. 

Amongst all the wonderful restaurants we went to, Joe Beef absolutely blew all of the other restaurants out of the water. The food is phenomenal but what really made our night was the incredible, incredible service. We sat at the bar (I love sitting at the bar), and our two servers/bartenders took such great care of us. The attention to detail, the unpretentiousness and just the genuine desire to make you, as a customer, happy made this one of my most memorable dining experiences that I will never stop gushing about. We will definitely be back again! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!

Now onto the food...

Veal tongue - super tender and flavorful, very generous portions

Lobster spaghetti with bacon - omg this was every bit as good as everyone says it is. Super generous with lobster and the sauce is perfection.

Cheval steak - bacon wrapped and topped with an egg. The man friend loved it. My first time trying horse meat and it was pretty tasty. The winning bite is actually eating the steak with the sauce from the lobster spaghetti. That was POW...delicious!

Hazelnut cake - slice of heaven. Moist and not too sweet. Perfect way to finish off our meal. 

Now I'm hungry after talking about all this good food...."}
{"text":"Arguably, THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE! Coupled with the best service with that meal, provides and unforgettable experience.

Had no clue that were ever going here, and quite honestly haven't heard of this place. My buddy got the recommendation and we just walked from our hotel following him to the restaurant not knowing where we were going. In fact, I don't even think we had a reservation, but I upon arrival, the stars aligned and they said they will squeeze us in.

They quoted about a 25 minute wait, so we awaited in the front for about 5-10 minutes then told us to come in and wait in their patio for another 10-15. That was fine as we started off with a bottle of wine.  After that, everything went by quick. Our server, Isabella(?) was stellar. We wanted to try everything so she asked if we line exotic stuff like horse meat, or \"regular\" stuff like their beef dishes and corn.  She then proceeded to make her own tasting menu based on what we told her we liked.

All her choices were mind blowing! Since this review is already long, I'll try and make it shorter since I got overly excited about writing about this place.  I can't remember all the names of the dishes and what was in them, but at least I have the pictures! Started with the salami plate and the just kept getting blown away. Even one of their simple dishes such as the corn was heavenly, but their grass fed steak was my favorite dish. Better than some of my favorite steakhouses here in la. Also, their lobster spaghetti is a must try as well!!  

Service was so good, a lot of the staff came in to check on us...then next thing we know, we were all sharing a few drinks with everyone! Awesome.  Even the chef came out to greet us. We felt like vips for sure.  

There's more to write about other dishes we had, and even our crazy 4 dish dessert, but I'll leave it here and you can check out the pictures."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD. There's a lot of hype around Joe Beef, so the expectations were high and it it delivered spot on, validating its rank as one of he best places to eat in Montreal (or Canada really). The food was REALLY, REALLY good. They set a casual/comfortable atmosphere and the shuffle of songs included classic rock and post-punk. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, passionate and helpful ... no pretension here. 
It is, what I have come to refer to as a \"Chalkboard Bistro\"; an excellent, creative restaurant that provides their menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I find this a little annoying especially for the wine selection process ... maybe they know you'll be back and want you to be able to review the menu for the rest of your meal. 

TIP; try to avoid seating times like 6:30 / 9:00pm. This practice often leads to several tables being seated at the same time and the servers getting slammed."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is quite an experience.  In a dimly lit dinning room, the menu and drink list are written daily, in French on a chalkboard.  So to an English speaker whose comfort in French is pretty much limited to fries and manicures, the initial though of ordering food is pretty daunting.  However, after a little bit of a wait, a waiter comes over and effectively walks you through the menu and you breath a short sigh of relief followed by an immediate panic wave of how could you possibly choose?? So, you order more than you should but it's completely worth it because every single dish exceeds your expectations.  Chef David McMillan came out as dinner was winding down and chit chatted with the guests.  Chatting with him was an experience in itself! 

On a side note, Owen Wilson came in for dinner :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the world! This was the only restaurant I really wanted to try in Montreal and my friend Sarah and I luckily got 2 seats at the bar due to a cancellation. The food was exceptional and the guys who work at the bar are super friendly. We got the uni shot starter ($5 Canadian), the lobster spaghetti ($35 Canadian), the \"minute\" aka skirt steak ($28 Canadian), and the corn cake with strawberries and creme fraiche for dessert. Everything was delicious. The lobster spaghetti is a no brainer. I don't especially like cream based pastas but wow, the flavor was amazing and lobster was really fresh. The portion was on the smaller side. Sarah and I shared but I think we could've easily ordered our own :) The minute steak comes medium rare but actually came out more as rare. If you don't like rare meat, you should ask them to cook to medium. Even though skirt steak is sometimes tough and not as flavorful, Joe Beef executes well and I really loved this dish. The corn cake dessert was really good. It's basically corn bread and perfect if you don't like dessert too sweet. It was just sweet enough to close out our perfect dinner. Total bill was under $120 Canadian including tax and tip."}

The style is non apologetic indulgence and unlike APC the staff is genuinely friendly and the food even better. I had the 1/2 double down, and thank GOD it was the 1/2, so rich a 1/4 would have been better. The sous chef at the raw bar steered my to try the little limes, amazing oysters! Then I had the famed lobster spaghetti for dinner. The 2.4 mile walk back to the Sheraton was not penance enough."}
{"text":"Been waiting a long time to come here. Worth the hype, worth the 5 hour drive and -10 degree weather. Food was exceptional, wait staff was wonderful with suggestions and guiding us through ordering. Felt very at home; unpretentious food, service and atmosphere. Upon leaving we did encounter a man who asked for our left overs. I gave him five bucks instead, I think that speaks for itself. Thanks for an unforgettable meal."}
{"text":"My experience at Joe Beef was nothing short of terrible, and it does not comfort me that I am with all evidence not the only one.

My girlfriend and I booked a table for Saturday night as part of a nice getaway to Montreal for the weekend. As we were warned about the popularity of the place, we booked several days in advance. I should have seen the red flag in the first place when someone from the restaurant called 90 minutes before the reserved time to ask if \"we were still willing to go on with the reservation\" (they didn't say they'd call to confirm when we originally booked). I was a little puzzled but did not think much of that at the moment.

We entered the restaurant right on time only to find no one welcoming us. No smile and \"I'll be with you shourtly either\": we were instead left waiting in the minuscule bar area for five minutes while being pushed by busy waiters before someone approached us and opened us with an \"Aaah, ok\" after I stated we had a reservation. Said waitress then goes away for another two minutes before a different employee leads us to our \"table\".

The table was outside, which no one alerted us too during the reservation process. It was not even a wooden table like the rest of the restaurant had, but a small, short, uneven-legged, metallic *garden* table covered in towels (yes, towels) as smaller objects would otherwise fall between its pierced surface. No word of apology or checking the table was ok for us, or reason why it was different from all the others was uttered at all. It took us a minute to realize it was places so that it was impossible to read the (French-only) menu on the blackboard while seated: we had to stand up and walk ten steps to contemplate it. No wine menu was present on the blackboard.

At that point, I thought back at the confirmation call and it all made sense to me: they were fully booked and just wanted to get rid of the English-speaking Yankees to make room for a better-connected party: as we confirmed the reservation, rather than decline the late bookers they just gave them our table and places us on a add-on, preposterous arrangement whose most immediate relative is the children table of your family wedding. A quick look at Yelp reviews from my iPhone confirmed this was exactly the way Joe Beef does business: you stay classy, Joe Beef.

We should have left the place at once, but we went on to order an entree and a main course (no wine, as there was no wine menu in sight nor we were asked if we'd like some by an overly hurried waiter). The food came in (rice with beef Indian way, zucchini flowers, veau liver and salmon a la Provencale) and was good in an absolute sense but not remotely excellent or consistent with the prices Joe Beef asks (the two of us paid $120 with no dessert and wine).

The climax was as another waitress approached my gf with the line:\"Don't you feel like in Italy with this small, romatic table?\". The girlfriend, actually being a citizen of Italy, where such a treatment at a restaurant is unheard of, could not help responding with a dry:\"Not really\". Surely enough, word came to our designated waiter we did not like the towel-covered table and he came in offering the usual free dessert you can read about in so may Yelp reviews. He did so in a hurried, annoyed way and did not accompany it with the slightest hint of an apology. We turned the cake (of his choice) down and proceeded to pay and not let the unfortunate incident of walking into this establishment ruining our night any longer.

I have the utmost respect of anyone working in the restaurant business and the highest admiration for the daily miracle most of them make happen in the face of countless logistic and financial obstacles and risks, in order to make a living for themselves but also to put a smile on the faces of their guests, from whence comes, I believe, their professional realization. For this very reason, it deeply saddens me that the restaurant business is also populated by the likes of Joe Beef, which, in the light of all the similar experiences here, is obviously cashing in some early success by reguarly ripping off and disappointing their guests, especially the new ones. In the age of Yelp, this is a strategy for meeting one's demise, a fate that I believe will touch this establishment sooner than later. In the meantime, don't do yourself a disservice by believing your travel guide, and steer away from 2491 St. Catherine Ouest: I am sure you'll find dinner spots more deserving of your money and, above all, trust."}

{"text":"Has earned and continues to earn its place in the foodie elite league."}
{"text":"One word: OVER-RATED. Just got back from dinner at Joe Beef and I could not have been more disappointed. Our reservations were for 9:30PM and we weren't seated till 9:50PM. What's worse was we waited 40 minutes after we were done with our appetizers to get our entrees!! I am not kidding: FORTY minutes. The waitress came by twice to apologize and said she'd \"love to offer us dessert\" which meant she'd love to but can't. The food was good but nothing extraordinary, especially for the prices they charge here. I will not come back again to this place and will recommend Au Pied De Cochon to everyone over this establishment any day of the week."}
{"text":"Left completely puzzled at the critical acclaim of Joe Beef's food and restaurant compared to my experience as a diner here.  All I can think of is that Joe Beef kitchen and wait staff actually tries to give a good meal when critics come to the restaurant, but that this is not the average dining experience.

Disaster service and uneven food where good elements were far outnumbered by mediocre and outright bad dishes.  

-Poor service (although with a smile).  Wait staff was unprofessional, but they were pleasant.  Other reviews cite the staff as pretentious, but I saw them as hipsters playing no supervision.  Late in the meal our waiter revealed that both owners were not at the restaurant, and I wondered if both food and service would be different had they been there.  It was a Saturday night.

-Food was incredibly uneven, and the good didn't make up for the bad.  

Oysters were phenomenal, and were the highlight of the meal.  (Once we ordered, it took 45 minutes for oysters to arrive.)

Next, among four entrees (appetizers) to share among the table - all of them, including the signature fois gras sandwich, were non-descript.  Fois gras sandwich and eel nuggets were just fried without any distinct flavor; a baked clam was overrun by runny and nondescript filling; chilled asparagus had flavor but whatever combination of flavors used (I can't put my finger on it) made me nauseated.  If these dishes are usually flavorful and good, then the execution for our table was way off.

We ordered two plats (mains) to share. Joe Beef steak was very good; a sausage and mussels dish also made me nauseated. Mashed potato side (puree p.d.t) was fine; kale side was flavored in a similar way to the asparagus entree and again nauseated me.  

Two desserts were as nondescript as the entrees.  Homemade soft serve in a cold (literally, served chilled!) beignet.  If it was supposed to be a novel service of beignets, it is one that will not catch on.  It was disgusting.  The other was similar - homemade soft serve on a fried dough with some very unelegant looking strawberry pieces.

-Presentation of all dishes revolved around just flopping food onto a plate.  So unappetizing.  

This was a disaster meal, and I left totally annoyed.  Montreal has so many good restaurants (we had an impeccable meal the night before). Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really amazing experience was lucky enough to get same day reservation with DINR app :) We decided to pretty much give the waitress carte blanche and took everything she recommended to have a great experience.
Started out with an old fashion cocktail with bourbon was pretty strong but also kind of average.
The appetizer was to die for ! The veal tartare was so fresh and amazing! The dressing on the salad was like an explosion in my mouth !!! I'd say the best tatare I've ever had and I love tartare...
After came the Quebec lamb, the piece of resistance paired with a nice Pinot noire suggested by waitress ! The size was huuuuge and presented in a nice casserole with potatoes, carrots and other veggies. It was the perfect dish to share, the lamb just fell off the bone and the sauce really complemented everything especially the veggies. 
Last step was dessert, again took the waitress's recommendation with an \"Easter Sunday\" after asking for something light I was a little scared lol when it came out it was a beautiful sorbet with lots of colour and different kinds of flavours all made in the restaurant of course. Perfect way to end the meal, skipped the coffee since it was midnight and felt like sleeping !

A well deserved 5 star review !!!! If you want the full experience with a bottle of wine expect around 150$ person or if you just want to go for main course like 50$."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had service with Nelson, one of the bartenders.

Very memorable and delicious dinner.  

Lobster spaghetti was very good and I'm glad I got it, but probably wouldn't get it again next time (it's a bunch of butter and pasta and lobster so of course it tastes good).

Quail special with liver mousse and pickles was the best dish we had and a fantastic combination of ingredients.

Side of escargot was perfectly buttery and seasoned.

Marjolaine cake was simple but great."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went to Joe beef last week to celebrate our anniversary.  We've heard so many good things about it over the years so we decided to give it a try. 

We of course started with two caesars. Joe Beef is famous for their caesars. They were very good. I'm pretty sure they put horseradish in them which is key. Then we started with a plate of oysters. They had a choice between a few different kinds of oysters so we tried both the pacific and the Boston. It was the first opportunity I've ever had to try pacific oysters and I really liked them. They are softer than PEI oysters and taste a little sweeter. 

We then shared the smoked trout with pickled vegetables and potato cakes. The waitress informed us that Joe Beef has it's own smoker outside which we thought was pretty neat. When it arrived, the waitress asked if we wanted it deboned, and proceeded to debone it in front of us. Not sure if it was suppose to be a form of entertainment or not. I would have preferred if it just came already deboned. 

For the main meal Shannon had the lobster pasta dish and I had some cod in a white cream sauce. Following that, I had the desert which was a layered chocolate cake with some white cream on top. It was really decadent and rich. Probably my favourite part of the meal. 

We both thought our meals were up to par for a fancy restaurant standard. However, neither of us was blown away by the food either... given the price. Plus, I think their focus is probably on meat dishes and I don't eat meat."}

We luckily got a table.. well two tables.  When booking, there won't be anything open for more than 6 people.. we booked two 6 people reservations, and requested to sit together if possible.. unfortunately we could not sit next to each other.  When we arrived, we still had to wait past our reservations, which we did not mind much.. but how their attitude was toward us, was unforgettable.  They gave us this demeanor as if they were too good for us.. as if they did not want to serve us.  I hated that the menu was on chalk board only.. and in French only.. I did not mind that it is French only, but its kind of hard to look at the menu in the dark, and in the corner of the building where the menu is out of sight.  We wanted to try some horse ribeye and foie gras double down, both which was not available when was there, so we just asked the waitress to suggest some stuff for us.. we had the following:

- Oysters - fresh, sweet and salty

- Horse tartar - just wanted to try some horse, was okay

- Duck fat fries - delicious and crispy

- Bone marrow - rich and flavorful

- Blood tart - I did not care for this much, a little too bitter for my liking

- Lobster spaghetti - the lobster was cooked perfectly, the sauce was okay

- Duck - cooked perfectly, pack with flavor 

- Beef - also cooked perfectly, delicious

Overall, the food options were great, just very crappy service.  We probably would not come back."}
{"text":"Come here prepared to for meat and calorie overload!  But it is exceptionally good and the service was remarkable.  Very simply if you're traveling to the Montreal area you have to go to Joe Beef.  Oh, but plan ahead, they were booked 2 months in advance. I just got lucky with getting a last minute seat at the bar."}
{"text":"There is a reason this is one of the most renown restaurants in the world. If you are one of those people that have to have the staple dishes, go ahead and have the lobster pasta and a steak. My recommendations: go with small side dishes, and a lot of them. Trust the staff, the are knowledgeable and with a little guidance they will create the culinary experience you came for. The wines and atmosphere are great as well. This is a well organized institution of quality food that is made with love. If you didn't made a prior reservation- no worries- just go to the younger sister restaurant next door- Le vin Papillon, they will take you in."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience! I tried getting reservations online months prior to our trip, but it was completely booked! Not one to give up that easy, I called to see if I could get reservations! The hostess who answered was very helpful, and let me know I should call the week of to see if there were last minute cancellations. Called on Tuesday and was able to get a reservation for 2 on Saturday 7pm at the bar.

We arrived 10 minutes early and was seated immediately. The bartender was friendly and his drink suggestions were on point! The menu on the wall is only in French, but the staff is more than willing to talk through the menu. We ordered bouef cru comme une waldorf (AMAZING) to share and then the petites lasagnes and the ribeye d'Hemmingford. We finished the meal with the renverse a la framboise! A truly fantastic meal in a cozy but quirky establishment. I can't wait until my next trip to Montreal to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I really liked Joe Beef.  The ribs were some of the best I have ever tasted.  Their rabbit gnocci was also great.

I was sated facing the blackboard, which I have to say greatly enhanced my dining experience.  unfortunately for my wife she had her back to the menu and was frustrated that she had to be \"Ms. Memory\".  However the kitchen was generous to her and created a special off-menu dish that was exactly what she wanted.

Most of the guests were great, but the guy from Chicago seated immediately next to us was exceedingly loud and annoying."}
{"text":"Nothing gets more decadent in Montreal than Joe Beef.  The daily menu is on the black board from raw bar, wild game, lobster and of course big slabs of beef. All fresh ingredients from Quebec or Canada. Their raw bar selection is quite impressive covering both Canadian coasts.  Everything on the menu is cooked to perfection, but it's very RICH.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful in ordering both food and drinks.  The biggest downside is that you must book your table many weeks in advance, unless you can get a lucky table from a cancellation on that day.  Expect to spend at least 2.5 hours drinking and eating your meal, despite you might have a table at 9:30PM."}
{"text":"We drove to Montreal last Friday after work just to go to Joe Beef and damn was it worth it.

Our life changing meal started with ham slices with foie gra and horse tartar. Followed by lobster pasta and duck breast with duck sausage topped with a duck egg slices of foie gra in a sauce of duck heart bolognese. It ended with a beautiful slice of marjolaine. It was fantastic.

The service is was excellent. We had Alexandria as our waitress. She essentially ordered everything for us as the menu was entirely in French. Alexandria was so knowledgable that it was hard not to trust her -- I'm so glad we did. She did an excellent job. The restaurant itself was simple and beautifully lit. 
 
I am usually dubbed as a pretty cheap person but when our check came in I was shocked. I almost wanted to give them more money for the meal. And I'm not saying that it was cheap either. It was worth every penny. 

I would definitely drive back to Montreal just to dine at Joe beef again!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience must go while in Montreal server was fantastic great recommendations will absolutely go back every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"It does live up to the hype. If you can, sit outside. Great service and great food. Pasta with lobster, salami, lamb, frites. Nothing disappoints. Terrific wine. Yum. Will return"}
{"text":"It's rare when a restaurant lives up to its hype in Montreal, but Joe Beef is the real deal. When the guy who is elbow length of you is nagging you to try the lobster pasta, don't refuse the suggestion. Too be honest, there were so many things that sounded delicious that choosing one dish just insulted the other. As the waiter recited the long list of everything on the blackboard (because there are no menus), all I can hear from everyone was \"get the lobster pasta\". Now I'm proud to join the Joe Beef elite in suggesting the lobster pasta on my next trip to the famed restaurant, because my eyes always has room for seconds."}
{"text":"This restaurant was definitely worth the wait.

We allowed the chef to surprise us, and we were not disappointed.  The trout that we received was the best seafood I have ever eaten, and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Lobster spaghetti did not disappoint.

Fantastic service, the waitress was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I happened to be visiting from New York and my friend suggested we try this place.  We got lucky and they happened to have a table for four available that night.  I honestly didn't have any idea that a place called Joe Beef was actually one of the top restaurants in the city. Definitely a pleasant surprise!

We had pork fish sticks to start. Pork with fish stick batter and shape. It comes with mustard and pickles. Just a fun and interesting bite to start.

For mains we had steak, a soup in a pastry (don't recall the name), rabbit, and lobster spaghetti.  Every single item was absolutely phenomenal. The rabbit had the most delicate flavor and the lobster spaghetti was perfectly al dente pasta, amazing sauce, and perfectly cooked lobster.

The dessert is really what blew our minds.  The server dropped off a bagel with salmon and cream cheese and just waited for our reaction.  After a few puzzled moments, we told him we hadn't ordered that.  He said, that's the dessert, break into it and try it.  The bagel was pastry, the salmon was candied fruit, the onions were apple, and the cream cheese was ice cream.  What an amazing mind-bending treat!

I've been to several Michelin 1 and 2 star restaurants in NYC and San Fran and I would say the quality of food at Joe Beef easily surpasses them in a much more casual atmosphere.  If you visit Montreal, I highly recommend making reservations well in advance so you won't have to trust in luck like we did. It's absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food excellent service. Takes a while to get a reservation! I had a 40oz stake, wow it was soo good. They tell you the source of the produce, like what farm the meat came from, age etc... good quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"Went to Montreal and was told by NUMEROUS people that I must go to this restaurant. Was super last minute but was able to land a reservation a week in advance by calling in. You may have to try a few times for someone to pick up but it's just because they are that busy. Once we got in there we were blown away by the service and food. It was a dim lit place, perfect for dates and fine dining. Our server was amazing and suggested everything we should get. We started with three different oysters as a starter then moved into the lobster pasta and rabbit for mains. Washed it down with some red wine. Amazing. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"A good restaurant, but not a great one at the time of my visit.

We were able to squeeze in a reservation for two at the bar, and were very excited given all the hype this restaurant has. But it just didn't meet those expectations for me. 

We each had a glass of wine, then followed with the local buffalo mozzarella appetizer which came with 2 slivers of fish and 2 slices of rye toast. The cheese was lovely, but nothing to write home about; it's fresh mozzarella? Next we had the smoked meat croquettes which were really good, easily the highlight of the meal -- it's everything you love about smoked meat squished up into a little tater-tot sized bite with a pickle on top. 

For entrees, we split the gentleman's steak with bleu cheese and while it was extremely well cooked (rare) it was really pricey for what amounted to a properly cooked steak with a scoop of garlic spinach on the side. However the portion is huge, so if you split it between two it's actually pretty reasonable. 

For dessert we had the strawberry and pistachio gratin, which was hyped up a lot by the bar staff. The berries were too early to be flavorful so they macerated them in sugar to increase the flavor. The creamy pistachio flan was amazing though! 

In all, it was a meal with highs (pistachio flan in the strawberry dessert & smoked meat croquettes) and okay points. For a restaurant of it's reputation, we expected more. The ambiance is great, the staff is helpful, but if you're and english speaker you're out of luck -- the menu is in french and only written on one chalkboard. Thankfully I speak french and was able to get by, but I can see how it's hard for others."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.
I need to preface this review by stating that I have been going to Joe Beef for the last half decade. I loved this restaurant. LOVED IT. My husband and I make a yearly trip from NYC to Montreal, and make it a point to go to Joe Beef. And every time we've gone, we've dropped a serious amount of cash on it--we actually save up to do so, because we love it that much.
We went this year, having missed going last year because it was closed so the owners could open their new restaurant, and believe me when I say we lamented the loss all year long. This year we took my husband's parents for the first time, and were very excited to have them experience it.
When I say this was the worst restaurant experience of my life, understand that it pains me to do so. And when I say that not only was the initial experience bad, but the follow up and subsequent experience trying to contact Joe Beef for an explanation was worse, please understand what an incredible disappointment that was. When you're a loyal customer who has actually sent friends and family over the border to spend money at a restaurant, has purchased your cookbooks to give to people, and is in general one of the people who has helped you, with dollars and loyalty, get where you are, and you're completely disregarded, there is nothing more shameful or sad. And I say this now, again: you should be ashamed, owners of Joe Beef. And for all those who have had good experiences there, please understand, the second you have a TERRIBLE experience, you'll find yourself on the same side of the fence I'm currently on, and realize that these restauranteurs care about nothing more than your dollars.
The experience, to sum it up as quickly as possible: the oysters were wonderful, but they're always wonderful. I found it odd that they've abandoned serving the oyster sauces in metal cups, instead opting for those strange disposable paper cups you get medicine in at the hospital, but whatever. My fault for ignoring warning signs of lower quality. After the oysters, it was all terrible.
We waited over an hour for our appetizers. My husband got some kind of spam-like thing with macaroni in it that was oversalted and made me ill to even try, and both my FIL and MIL got a cold soup. Both of their soups came out luke warm. It being a 90+ degree day, and the fact that the AC was barely working in the restaurant, my MIL sent it back and told the waiter it was fine, she would go straight to her main course. We had already waited over an hour for apps, so we didnt want to risk pushing the mains out further by waiting for another soup, and besides, she said it was way too salty for her to eat. The waiter came straight back with the soup, and to cool it down, what had he done? He put ICE CUBES in it. We immediately sent it back.
We waited another hour plus for our main course. At this point, we should have left. My favorite dish, the lobster pasta, was missing every ingredient but the lobster, cream, and pasta; my husband's steak was overcooked; my MILs duck was chewy and the sides that came with it, too salty to eat. We barely ate our meal. The bill came (approx $400) and there was an extra alcoholic beverage thrown on there, I guess to push some salt in the wound. Nothing was comped, no apologies, just thanks for your money.
THE WORST PART: Husband and I left completely defeated and dejected. It felt like someone had died; it felt like a loss. Our favorite restaurant in Montreal was gone. I went on the Joe Beef facebook page to leave a comment, which was neither nasty nor cruel, and within 10 minutes, the comment was gone: no response, no nothing. Just deleted. I took screenshots of course, and posted something again, screenshots of the original comment included. Again, deleted. No comment. The least they could do was respond to me--even a \"We're so sorry for your experience\" blah blah blah would have been honorable and nice, but no. Nothing. So I posted a screenshot of the last deleted comment, and commented again. I don't think I need to tell you how quickly it was deleted. And that I'm now blocked.
To me this speaks to restauranteurs who don't care for their customers, don't stand by their food, and don't respect the people who pay their bills. I've never had an experience where a business has just deleted bad reviews and ignored their customers in such a way. I'm shocked and saddened by the immaturity and senselessness of it. If I were eating at McDonald's, whatever. But to drop almost half a grand on a meal and be completely ignored and disregarded? That isn't right; they should be ashamed. For all those with good experiences, I hope they continue, because I know what a good Joe Beef experience is like, and it is wonderful. But I hope for your sake that you don't ever have to go through what we went through, because Joe Beef has proven he won't care."}
{"text":"We'd heard a lot of buzz about Joe Beef so we knew that when we got to Montreal we'd have to check it out. On the whole, it was a great experience.

*Service - excellent. Even though our servers were BUSY it didn't keep them from being on point about order taking/food delivery/drink refills etc. Our waiter even went through the entire menu with us (as it was only in French). They were also really affable and friendly which is always a plus.

*Food - 
Foie Gras Double Down. This is a MUST. This may be the most flavorful thing I've ever eaten. I don't know if I could stomach a whole portion because it's sinfully rich, but the few bites I had were heavenly. 
Lobster Spaghetti. this looked like it might contain at least 3 whole lobsters, was cooked perfectly al dente, and had a rich creamy lobster sauce that somehow succeeded in not being overwhelming. Very nice, perfectly executed dish.
Steak Joe Beef. So deliciously soft the way steak should be. It had a nice strong peppery flavor (which I actually tend not to like). One note: it is a very fatty cut (NY Strip I believe?). Not usually my thing, but this wasn't my entree so I wasn't too concerned.

*Decor/Ambience - The place looks like a log cabin inside, which I actually really dig. The music was a mash up of things (think Tupac & The Smiths) which was very cool. Props to them for not censoring the music - this isn't a place for children.

Why not 5 stars? A few reasons:
- It's unbearably hot. Unfortunately, I had dressed for the 65 degrees it was outside, and couldn't remove enough layers to be comfortable in the stiflingly hot place. At $30-$50/plate, this always packed restaurant can afford another AC. 
- No printed menus. I get that it's part of the charm, blah blah, but many of the seats are not in a place where you can comfortably see it. I, for example, would have been interested in the wine list, but it was on a chalkboard far away in a high traffic area and it just wasn't worth the trouble (or added heat/claustrophobia).
- About the prices. Totally fair considering what you're getting, but it'd be great if they did half portions on the entrees. They're all MASSIVE. 

Bonus: Try their house brew. It's really tasty - but be aware that a bottle will set you back $10."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere very casual feel, great service, fun crowd, menu changes daily, main items are there daily like their lobster spaghetti which is to die for, they grow there own herbs, they have great choices of smoked meats, seafood, and a cool raw ouster bar. The best seat in the house is at the oyster bar or in the glass windows facing the streets. This place is just down right cool. Please check them out!"}
{"text":"food was great as expected.  would not go 5 star cause menu only on blackboard. hard for us old folks to see( espec in this poorly lighted environment) Server was good and very familiar with her offerings; just a little pushy and got us to order more food than we should have.  I would absolutely recommend.  My wife loved the duck and I went with the lobster pasta...very rich and delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to dine at joe beef on a recommendation from a friend of a friend.  Open table was showing the restaurant was completely full so we decided to call, when we called they offered us a 9:30pm so we took it (later we found out this restaurant books months in advance).  We arrived to a line out the door (that must be a good sign).  So after waiting for about 15 minutes to be greeted....finally someone approached us and took us to our table.  

They sat us outside which was nice, I immediately thought it might be cold but we noticed large heaters so my fears were calmed.  There is an adorable garden, that the restaurant uses for there fresh produce.  

Being that it was almost 10 pm we were anxious to start drinking and eating.  Several wait staff moved from table to table around us but no one actually approached our table.  After 15 minutes I decided to take it upon myself and approach the bartender.  When I mentioned to the bartender that I liked full bodied California red wines, he sort of snickered and said that they do not serve full bodied wines because they over power the ingredients:/......hmmmm.  

I would not have had to approach the bartender if they had a printed list at the table.  The wine list is on the wall in the main dining room (in French) which is strange because we were sitting across the restaurant.  So to make a wine selection you have to hover over the tables in the main dining room.)  

Finally a very friendly waitress arrived!  She helped with a wine selection and read the menu in English to us.....yes the entire menu.  We quickly regained faith that the evening was going to be fun.  

For our appetizer we order the pickle and bread plate, the bruschetta with ham, and the tomatoes and mozzarella.  The pickles were to die for, the rest was just ok.  

We decide to get the VERY large steak and share it, it was a gorg presentation.  We also ordered roasted cauliflower, French fries, and creamed spinach.  Although the steak had an amazing presentation it was \"just a steak\".

So although the Florida girls I was with were a little freaked out by the menu(which included horse meat).  It was a fun and memorable night!!!"}
{"text":"Note the comment about seriously overpriced wine list--that is so true. And they source a lot of the wines through private bottlings so there is even less excuse. $50 for a totally lame cotes-du-rhone.  On another visit (to McKiernans, adjoining) I chose from a sadly limited selection a glass of Puglia Chardonnay that was thin and faintly corked.

Brings LOTS of $$$ if you hope to drink well."}
{"text":"After building an entire trip to Montreal around Joe Beef, the hype was high. There was no way it was living up to expectations. I was preparing myself for a letdown. But in the end, I've never had a better overall dining experience. From food, to ambiance, to service, I've never felt more satisfied satisfied leaving a restaurant. If you can only eat at one restaurant in Montreal, try to make it Joe Beef. I could eat there every weekend, and I don't think the experience would ever grow old.

We were seated in a corner table by the window and next to the bar, protected from some of the restaurant noise and bustle. I think it must be the best seat in the house, and if you're eating in a party of two or three, I'd do your best to reserve it.

Our waitress, Alex, started off perfectly, offering to guide us through the entire meal. We put down our menus, and Alex surprised us with everything (we selected the category of drink we would be having, and told her we needed the lobster spaghetti). I'd recommend this style as well - if you're at Joe Beef, sit back, accept that you are going to spend a bunch of money, and enjoy the ride. Alex was the best server I've ever had. She made great selections, picked on us, made recommendations for other restaurants, and gave us her email for any returns to the city.

Three hours later (I should quickly mention that you don't go to Joe Beef for a quick meal - food service was slow, but our servers were always attentive), we were full on a perfect meal and drunk off fantastic cocktails. 

For appetizers we had montreal smoked meat croquettes (a must) and a clam salad (decent - more of a palate cleanser). For entrees, the horse steak (perfectly prepared, fantastic sauce, definitely worth ordering if you've never had horse), the lobster spaghetti (read other reviews, this lives up to the hype), and pork schnitzel (I was betrayed by my first bite, which thought it was a run of a mill schnitzel. The flavors are complex, and this is also definitely worth ordering).

For dessert, a classic French cake (forgetting the name) that I loved but my dining companions found mediocre. My review is the correct one - I don't love cake but loved this cake, and that's saying a lot.

Throughout the meal, we enjoyed a wine selected by Alex, and some of the best cocktails I've ever had. We also were given two rounds of free drinks - one a celebratory shot shared with the kitchen staff, another a \"just because\" drink. 

Come here, enjoy one of the best restaurant experiences you'll ever have. But do so fully prepared to let go, to spend money (we dropped $175 pp, but also drank quite a bit), and to eat a lot."}
{"text":"The greatest food & service ever in my life! My friends and I did Omakasa style and had the server choose our meals. 

We went all out and did not regret it. Every meal complimented each other which enhances the overall experience. So good I'm making a YouTube vid about the experience!

{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here while in town. We ordered scallops, foie gras, steak, and the lobster spaghetti of course. Scallops had an overload of shaved carrots, foie gras was alright- nothing spectacular, and the steak was kind of weird... not your norm you'd eat in the States. The lobster spaghetti was the best! Also the dessert- some weird ice cream that was yellow/brown lol. Not even sure what it really was. Came with a sparkler and it completed my night! The server gave us a complimentary round of shots we shared with the table next to us. 
Steak was weird. I can't explain it. The meat wasn't as tender. It came with a side of these huge leeks that didn't even taste like leeks! (good thing, btw.) Overall nice experience, but don't understand how this is one of the top places to dine in Montreal...
Make a ressie if you go!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner  4 nights ago and was impressed . The food was good and the service  was great. The restaurant had a very cosy vibe.

Just letting you know it can get very loud but they do play the notorious B.I.G"}
{"text":"This place has huge portions and great good. Also, the atmosphere is really quaint (read small) and therefore reservation are a must.

Liverpool House (same chef and owner) is also worth trying out!"}
{"text":"This was our most anticipated stop in Montreal and we made reservations a few weeks before we arrived.  

We started off with a couple of cocktails which were delicious and well made.  We were lucky enough to have a view of the bar and watching the lone bartender make drinks, take food orders at the bar was quite a sight. 

There is massive wine by the bottle list on a chalkboard in the main dining room; by the glass isn't as extensive but has numerous choices.  Our waitress was friendly and enthusiastic and let us take our time in ordering and eating.  The menu is vast and written in French on the chalkboard.  Our waitress didn't go through each and every item, but asked us what we were in the mood for and our likes and then highlighted many of the items; maybe not completely optimal, but I didn't think we missed out on anything.

Starters included the stuffed fried zucchini blossoms which were stuffed with smoked meat, sauerkraut and cheese; they were lightly battered and fried and were excellent.  Light even though the majority of ingredients were anything but.  Next up was veal tongue with tomatoes and shaved black truffles. I've had tongue before and it is normally sliced thin or chopped up; not this version.  It was served whole; yep just like a tongue looks.  Honestly I was a little taken back, but once I got past it and dug in I realized how good it was.  

At this point (about 8pm) things seemed to have quieted down and tables emptied out; that didn't last long, that was the lull in between the early and late crowd.  Within minutes all seats were once again occupied; I can't imagine you can get in without a reservation.

On to entrees we wanted the signature lobster spaghetti and another dish so our waitress suggested ordering a half portion of the spaghetti which was a great call.  The Lobster spaghetti was decadent and divine.  It was so creamy and satisfying that I wanted to keep eating it and almost wished we had a full order (which would have totally been a mistake).  We also got the chicken which was half a chicken that was roasted served along with clams and calamari; seemed like an odd combo, but it worked so well together.  The seafood was tender and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  It was a sensational dish.

For dessert we opt'd for the hazelnut layer cake which was light and not too sweet; it was a perfect ending.  Joe Beef lived up to the hype and I am so happy I was able to experience it."}
{"text":"During a short visit to Montreal and after discovering how long you have to wait to get a dinner booking at Joe Beef, I enlisted the service of a concierge company that was able to secure a reservation for 7:30 pm the next day ( however, I was called three times on the day to ensure I will be going or else Joe Beef will punish them and refuse any new bookings from their company!!) 
I had a feeling that the booking was for a bar seating (which I usually dislike in restaurants when food is involved) and checked with concierge to be told it is a table 
Walking inside the tiny restaurant I was ushered with my gang to the stools 
However, it was abolishing in disguise 
Setting on the bar gave me a) the space to move freely ( and not feeling cramped between adjacent tables that I can not go to the toilet or even move my handbag from attaching to my body)  and b) I had lovely chat with bartenders which made the night way more enjoyable 

The main aspect of any restaurant is the food 
And in terms of portions - it is so filling 
However my steak was overlooked 
My partner streak was undercook 
And my friend's main of fish was served cold ! 
In a nutshell we did not enjoy the food"}
{"text":"After anticipating the meal at Joe Beef for nearly two months, it's my fault that this mecca couldn't live up to my mammoth expectations. 

A good meal is much more than just good food. It's the feeling you get the moment you walk into a kitchen or a dining room. It's perusing the menu, catching whiffs from the kitchen, pleasant conversation, delectable alcohol, dim lighting, a comfortable background din (or good music), anticipating the courses - a moment of suspension in time. A good dining experience cocoons you in the moment, in the here and now, taking you away from the routine of everyday life. The end result in this case is that Joe Beef could very well have been a great restaurant, and a great meal, to many people, but to us on that Friday night in April, it was not.

Our reservation was for 7pm and it was still bright outside. The dining room was tiny, a few large tables and several 2-tops crammed about one inch apart --the whole table had to be physically moved out and turned sideways for the person against the wall to sit down. Being crammed into a small area when it's still bright outside is uncomfortable. Once the sun has set, this feeling might not be so grating. The chalkboard menu was also very irritating. It was so large and obtrusive in an attempt to be unpretentious that, erm, it was pretentious. So you have a menu that changes frequently, we get it. Forcing people to stand crouched over in front of an overpriced blackboard after making reservations for months in advance is pretty obnoxious. See the contradictions here?

I wanted to order the truckstop piglet, but the waitress (granted, very pretty and seemingly well-intentioned), told me not to order this because it wouldn't be enough to share. Instead she steered us towards the rabbit dish, which in retrospect I don't know how I let her do, because I much prefer pork to rabbit and I'd just had rabbit in Quebec City. But it was one of those panicked moments where I wanted to please HER and thought I'd just put my trust in her hands and let her lead me down this culinary road.

We started with raw oysters which were good, but not \"spectacular.\" The next course was the foie gras double down - two pieces of foie gras battered, deep fried and placed together with a strip of melted cheese, bacon and maple syrup drizzle in between. It was a little morsel from heaven. This was the best course for sure, but there was only enough for 1.5 bites each (got the half order). The rabbit course was fine - two rabbit legs that were not particularly tender or off-the-bone or generous in size, covered with a mushroom cream sauce that was very tasty. There were a few mushrooms in the bowl and some dandelion greens, but not much else. I felt my heart drop when I saw the truckstop piglet (a beautiful rectangle of smoked pork covered with a crunchy piece of skin) presented to the man sitting next to me. His partner got the schnitzel, and a generous portion of that, may I add.

The meal left us unsatisfied, and given the crammed quarters, inability to hear each other, awkward chalkboard menu, inadvertent misguidance of the server and the \"trying too hard to be hip and humble\" snobbery of the place, paying nearly $170 for a good but not GREAT meal was disappointing. I like loud, frenetic bistros with chalk menus and adventurous food and good wine, but this place felt...forced.

Joe Beef: a little like the emperor's new clothes. Try it and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"Joe average Beef.  Absolutely not spectacular.  Hyped over the press and the rep but Anthony Bourdain was wrong. Love Montreal and with so many restaurants this is missable. 
Way overpriced and trying too hard to be out there with options. Could not even impress with the signature steak. 
Even for Montreal the service was uninspired. 
At half the price and no wait it would get 3.5 stars.
Thankfully the company was 10 stars and it saved the night."}
{"text":"Great place, note that the menu is 100% in French."}
{"text":"Annoyingly, Joe Beef really does live up to the hype.  From cover to cover, everything is wonderful.  In particular, the service, food and ambiance.  They will let you add here, take away there, do this, do that.  Just a splendid experience.  Cant recommend highly enough.  Get the horse tartare...Mr. Ed says so!"}
{"text":"Professional service and good wine list. I was disapointed by the deep fried KFC foie gras spin off but I had the best lobster pastas. Spot on. If you can afford it, please do."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable experience! I've been wanting to come, and finally snagged a spot (albeit at 9:30pm, but I didn't mind...I'll eat good food at any time of the day/night)! 

Their menu is on a large chalkboard, but luckily, I was seated right below it so it was easy to ruminate over what I wanted to pick. You can take a picture for ease of reference too. 

Service was really good; the waitresses were very nice and genuinely interested in whether the customer liked the dish or not. Mine checked up frequently, which was a nice touch. I asked mine what her favourite dishes were, and she was very persuasive! 

I tried 3 main plates and a beer (none of the appetizers seemed that amazing to me, haha). The chalkboard only had white and red wines (by the bottle) listed, so you have to ask the waitress for cocktails. Not sure if you can get the wines by the glass? It seemed to be only by the bottle. 

- Lobster spaghetti $38: a must-have. The spaghetti was still a bit firm, so it had a lot of bite. The sauce is RICH but also light; it tasted very seafood-ey and I asked for bread to soak it up (they don't automatically give you bread). There were 3 pieces of lobster which were tender and delicious. A nice light indulgence! 

- Smoked lamb shoulder with beets $37: WOW, super tender!!! There were 2 large pieces, beets, and some greens. The smokiness really added to the flavour of the lamb. 

- Horse tournedos $40: I've never tried horse before, so this was a must order for me, as I LOVE to try unique/rare/limited dishes. The horse itself was light-tasting, but still meaty. Although it didn't look huge, the portion was hearty since it's like eating a dense steak! The thick, rich, orangey sauce was savoury and with each bite I tried to get as much of it as possible onto the meat. I would say this is a must order, and I preferred it over the lamb! 

In general, the dishes were all made really well, although the presentation could be improved. It would also help if more details of the menu could be provided, such as a listing of the ingredients in each dish; on the chalkboard, only the major components of each dish are listed. 

The table next to me ordered the seafood platter, and were praising how fresh and delicious it was. I'll probably try that next time! I was too full for dessert, so that will also be for the next time. 

The atmosphere is quite dark but cozy, although it can get quite loud; I had to speak loudly to be heard, but it's definitely a lively environment!"}
{"text":"You would be insane not to eat here. It's a perfect experience from all angles."}
{"text":"I love love love this place and I can see why it is one of Montreal's staple restaurants. This lively gastropub is tucked in the middle of St. Henri/Griffintown. The service is excellent (our table got delayed by 45 minutes but the waiters made sure we had a place to sit at the bar while waiting and gave us appetizers on the house). 

We ordered two of their signature dishes: lobster spaghetti and Rib-eye steak with black pepper sauce and both of the dishes were amazing. The lobster spaghetti was so rich that I was sure it was made entirely of cream and butter and the lobster was cooked to perfection. The steak came a perfect medium topped off with a fried egg on the top. Both portions were enormous.

Although our bill was quite hefty (we also ordered wine), we felt like for the quality and quantity of our food fully justified the price. 

Do make sure that you reserve ahead of time (I had to reserve 2 months ahead of time for a Friday night dinner). 

PROS: amazing food, great atmosphere, Montreal classic
CONS: long waiting time, need to reserve way ahead of time"}
{"text":"overpriced food was mediocre and the service was full of attitude"}
{"text":"Joe beef came highly recommended, and this place delivered! It was sat night on Grand Prix weekend the place was packed as expected. We sat in the bar area which was a great setting. They have 4 different rooms you can choose from even some people took seats in their \"garden\" area. The service was great they were fast yet not rushing. I usually enjoy eating and leaving yet for some reason this place was such that I could have had a 3 hour meal. The food was all fresh, the salad was hand picked from the garden which I was looking at (highly recommend). My wife and I shared the bone in ribeye and wow was it tasty. The juice was non stop and the steak was filled with the best flavor. I could go on and on about Joe Beef but instead I'll just say go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"We almost bailed on this place because of the NY reviewers below but realized they had posted on like every possible reviewing site, and were soooo \"angry\" that we decided they had some personal vendetta towards the restaurant to go through the process of posting the same complaint to sooo many sites.   Thinking of how many people eat there every evening and theirs being the worst review led us to roll the dice.  

We had heard about this from the Andrew Zimmern Montreal episode but when I tried making reservations over a month out it kept giving me an option beyond our travel dates.  A few days before we left, I tried calling and to my surprise they offered us a late evening reservation.   We were excited.  

On the day of, we actually ended up arriving almost 45 minutes early (figured we would walk around if they wouldn't take us but they quickly led us to our table.   The restaurant was busy but not as \"tight\" fitting as some of these reviews had led me to believe.   We were greeted by an informative waitress who quickly switched to english to deal with us.   Sadly for her, it seemed every table that came in after us in her section was American so I felt bad for her as most tables struggled to read the chalkboard menu and needed extensive help.   We were crazy enough to bring our teen daughters along but she was sweet and patient with us as we had her make recommendations.   We decided to have the girls try sea whelk which they were hesitant about but ended up loving.    Then based on a recommendation went with the rib steak (for 2) to split among the four of us as our main entree.   We are SOOOO lucky we only got that because the rib steak was so big that even with all 4 of us having some, we actually ended up leaving two slices of the meat that we couldn't finish.   The meat was very flavorful and each of us loved it.   It came with a smoked sausage that was wonderful.   The only complaint was the main dish came with a side that was a baked celery root and it was sooooo salty we could not eat it.   

Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had such a great time at Joe Beef. It was a nightmare trying to get a reservation. But persistence is key. Eventually got one. And it was worth it. Not everything was perfect though, one dish was lackluster and pacing between dishes was pretty slow. But overall it was so much fun and quite good. 

The highlight was the eggplant with lamb dish. It was excellent. The rabbit terrine was delicious as well. The salami with fennel was very good. The veal ham was unique (veal in the style of ham) and quite good. The mains were great. The sweetbreads were excellent and a massive portion. The quail was rich and very good. The lobster pasta was perfectly cooked. The only dish that was underwhelming was the raw beef. 

The servers are quite friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I ate too much.

My favorite part about this restaurant is actually the atmosphere.  What a cool little spot.  Last night I sat on the outdoor patio.  Outdoor patio in October...I love it.  The patio is pretty small, three heaters and it is covered so you don't feel cold at all.  In fact, when I went inside it seemed too hot and stuffy as the place was packed!

Service was very good.  We seemed to have two servers, they kept checking on us and were pleasant to talk to and joke with.

The food was also good.  As I said up front, I ate too much, or maybe I shouldn't have had that much rich food!  I started with the Chevel Tartare.  I like to try new things and I had never had this before.  Chevel is quail right?  Anyways, it was a unique taste and texture.  My first bite was a bit odd, but then I ate every last bit.  It was very good!  My main dish was Cerf, I think that is an austrian type of chicken.  It was also very good!  And after a couple Joe Beef Beer's I had absolutely no room for dessert!

Two small things I didn't like, (not worth docking a star though), is that they do not take Amex.  It always annoys me when restaurants don't take it.  The second was that there was a SUPER obnoxious drunk guy at a table with 6 or 7 people.  He was so loud he overpowered everyone elses conversation, swearing, dirty jokes and stuff.  I don't usually care but this guy was excessive.  I would have appreciated the staff taking some action.  It was still packed with the dinner crowd, I don't need to hear about this losers last trip to Vegas or the girls he banged in high school.

All in all a great evening though."}
{"text":"We had a great table on the patio - really is cute back there, especially the table for two in the garden. I think the cool factor is high and the crowd is hip - definitely a fun spot. I found the menu creative, maybe to a fault (do we really need duck heart tacos?). I ordered to Burratta, which was ok, but not as good as others I've tried. I also had the schnitzel, which was fabulous, and huge! The oysters were fresh and delish. They are famous for the lobster spaghetti which was good, with generous portion of lobster (but very pricey). The rest of the menu changes regularly and I got the sense that the kitchen was free styling, since what came out was not always what was described by our waiter. So why the 3? It is over priced. 30 / 40 for mains seemed unnecessary. Also there were some misses at our table - including the scallops and the Cornish hen. Also the service was slow, though the servers were very friendly once they got to us."}
{"text":"Very good food. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting dishes. Go ask them if it is your first time going or you have no idea about what to order. You need to have reservation otherwise you probably need to wait a while before having a seat."}
{"text":"Everyone keeps talking and reviewing about the lobster spaghetti.  Well... GET IT!   I eat a lot and I've eaten in a lot of places and their lobster spaghetti will always be one of the things that will be on my mind like a first (good) love. The pasta is fresh (not from a box) and has the perfect bite, the lobster bisque sauce isn't too over-powering or salty, and there is so much lobster meat. The entire dish is just amazingly delicious. I split this dish and the bacon wrapped trout with a friend and we were stuffed. The trout was cooked perfectly and deboned from the inside. Our appetizer was a half order of their foie gras double down with maple syrup (who would've thought maple syrup would pair well) and their ham cold cut (I completely forgot the name of it and probably not doing it justice by calling it a cold cut - sorry).  Both were delicious. I believe the double down and the lobster spaghetti are menu staples.

The service is phenomenal. The menu changes and there's only one menu and it's written on a chalk board. The servers go one-by-one, unrushed, through each menu item in great detail. They are also super friendly and down to earth.

I really want to go back. Just for the lobster spaghetti. And to try a few more things. I cannot comment about the wine because I do not drink, but the servers are extremely helpful in helping you find something to pair with your dinner.

The place is not too big, so reservations may be hard to come by. We walked in at 5:45 (door was open and one server was able to accommodate a reservation for 2 at 6pm), and waited at the coffee shop next door."}
{"text":"Go w an empty stomach and $$$
I absolutely looooved it
It is very casual, friendly wait staff
Great great cocktails... They will make you one- just tell them what you like and they.ll figure out concoctions 
Idiot recall the oyster name but they were from pei on the large side sounds like\"co buvais\" DELICIOUS! And this is the only light dish of the night
Food here is dense, hearty and extremely extremely savory...
Yes, I.ve had kfc's doubled own and I.ve been shunned upon by my partner
So what better way to have a double down made of deep fried battered foie gras sandwiching smoked meat topped w cheese that melts from the heat w some sort of mustard sauce circled on the plate.  (I could eat 2.5 of these and call it the night) it.s very very dense and indulgent... It.s the feel of that crunchy fried battered meets Foie g meets mustard cheese smoked meat.... Ugh. So good... We also had the cutest little bread bowl filled w tongue and deep fried sweetbreads w a mushroom sage?! Sauce.... That was quite something... You just clean that plate w The bread bowl ...yup.... we ordered the liverwurst/Foie gras w a I believe it was sparkling wine/ gin jelly served w bread :) mmmmm... There wasn't enough bread so I just spooned the leftover liverwurst...it is very good....note...by now you feel a little full... The above is for four people and we were two...... My partner ordered horse filet mignon wrapped in bacon topped w a fried egg and a side or macaroni w shaved cheese....
The meat itself was medium rare and soft...smooth...but there is a pungent flavor on the meat itself that I didn't love...maybe because it is horse?!  .... Anyway I got the BBQ ribs!!!! hEAVEN! It.s a full rack..I could only eat half by now and it came w yummy spicy mayo and extra crispy fries w melted bits of parm cheese.... I left very content...I had desert.... I know I said I was full....but I like sweets .... I had the pumpkin sundae .... It was like a pumpkin cream/ paste on top of ice cream and topped w icecream and a side of warm butterscotch to drizzle on top...I finished it"}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Beef,

I usually don't write love letters to guys, especially guys with a last name of Beef but I'll make an exception for you, Joe. 

The dining experience I had at your place was a truly memorable. Maybe because I was on vacation and usually don't dine like this when at home, however the decor and vibe of the restaurant was special.  First of all, waiting for our table to be ready, we were guided to your rear patio next to the outdoor grill area where some of the meals are prepared to enjoy bottles of wine and cocktails.

I couldn't help but notice your very own garden where I'm sure you grow the vegetables you use in your place. I'm sure if I searched closer I'd find some ganja trees, but no judgement here if there were. 

Your fine staff took care of us from the very beginning to the bittersweet end, even shared a few drinks with some of them in the middle of our dining experience and got to meet the chef you transported from NYC. We were happy with the variety of menu items we selected from your chalkboard menu, and although it was in French, that was fine since I polished up on my food items before my trip.

From the appetizers including the salami whatever dish, lamb ragu, the bread with foie gras jelly, duck fat fries, the tiny fried fish. To the main dishes which included the lobster spaghetti and the grassfed bone-in semi-overpriced meat. Then the grand finale of the 4 course dessert menu which we could have passed on but so glad we didn't because it was the fitting way to close out the night.

Mr. Beef, your name is perfect ... Don't ever change.  

Well change just a little because if you stay the same, you know you're not growing. The only constant and life is change so keep it up and I'll be sure to come back next time I'm in Montreal.

Merci beaucoup ...

Je t'aime,

Bong E."}
{"text":"Seeing all the reviews and having this place so close to where I live, I was excited to try it! My boyfriend made a reservation here for my birthday and finally, I could try the food. First of all, I am, by no mean, a big meat eater. Pretty odd to choose this restaurant knowing that. I always thought, if I have to eat meat, better make it really good and worth it. And it was! First, we shared the deer tartare which... I really have no word for it. It just melted in the mouth, the deer as well as the bread. Then, we shared the pork ribs and shoulder and the duck breast. I can't tell which was my favorite. Meat was tender, the sauces were original, like nothing I've tasted before, simply delicious. 
The service was excellent. The waiter took his time to explain to us all the dishes and answered our questions in details. He made this whole experience even better.
Would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"During your brief time on earth, there will be a handful of meals that burn into your memory as key points in your photo album of life experience.

This is Joe Beef.

I can't even oversell this place.  It is simply jaw dropping.  No pretense.  Epic, huge, rich, inspired food.

Our server, Alexandra, was perfection.  Helpful, knowledgeable, excited about the food.  And charming.  Cocktail recommendations: fantastic. Wine recommendations: affordable and perfectly appropriate.  Boom.

The food.  Oh my lord in heaven above, the food.

Just do it.  Order the cheval - yes, it's horse tenderloin. Get over yourself. Eat this.  It was:

Listen closely.

It was the single best cut of meat I have ever tasted.  Ever."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is one of the restaurants my boyfriend and I made reservations at as soon as we decided to visit Montreal on vacation. 

We made our reservation approximately 8 weeks prior to our meal which is why I was surprised and disappointed when, after being ignored for several minutes upon our arrival, watching two parties who entered the restaurant after us being greeted and sat immediately, we were finally told we could be seated at what I consider the worst table in the place. We were seated at the table directly next to the door, in front of the menu that's written on a black board. Why would I consider this the worst table? Throughout our meal two different people stood in front of us using the flash on their camera to take pictures of the menu. And as the evening went on and more people arrived to find their table was not yet available they had nowhere to stand except for directly next to our table, hovering as we ate. My boyfriend couldn't even sit back in his chair without having someone's elbow bumping his head. Both of these things are very distracting and take a little something away from a romantic dinner.  


I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant but I felt the crowd was very pretentious. 
We enjoyed our bottle of wine and I loved the Oysters that were served with horseradish, vinegar, cocktail sauce and lemon! We asked the waitress(who was so sweet and knowledgeable) to surprise us with two of her favorite appetizers. She brought us smoked salmon with cucumber which was okay and a \"crab chop\" that I enjoyed but wasn't anything special, not something I expected to get at Joe Beef. We chose the venison tart with foie gras as our main course, this is where we were truly disappointed. The tart had no flavor, we couldn't believe that something made with venison, foie, mushrooms, onions and sun-chokes could be so flavorless. I asked the waitress for salt thinking I could save the dish with some slaty flavor, but I was wrong, it was far too bland. 

We are the least pickiest eaters out there but we couldn't eat the meal we had eagerly looked forward to for months. We also had previously made reservations for Joe Beef's sister restaurant Liverpool for the following night, but we were so disappointed with our experience here that we cancelled the Liverpool reservation. 

The 3 stars are for our super nice server, overall ambiance and because I hate giving less than 4 stars :/"}
{"text":"when we got here, we realized that we had booked the wrong date. they managed to get us a table in the garden anyway! staff are very welcoming, helpful, and informed. atmosphere is great. we had oyster caesars and a raw seafood platter with urchin, crab legs, and oysters to start. it was fresh and delicious. for main course i had a hangar steak which was prepared in hebrew deli style, and my girlfriend had the lobster sausage. both were delicious, but on the salty side. for dessert we had rhubard ice cream and it was heavenly. overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered half chicken and the legendary lobsters spaghetti. The entrees we got tomato and peach salads and the squid stuffed with lobster.  As desert, I had the ice cream and my friend ordered the petite fruit something. 

So here is the thing, the first tomato entree was ok. Not much to talk about. The squid was better, the sauce was pretty good with mushroom and have pretty strong lobster flavour. I would give the entree 3.5/5

The main course, the half chicken is actually really nice, however, two waiters came to us with the joking kinda tone \"request\" us to use the sauce came with the chicken, which was slightly uncomfortable when a waiter said \"I don't feel like you use enough sauce\" maybe he was trying to be funny but it was not cuz the sauce tasted very much mustarded and for me it feels like too much sesame paste in it, I don't think they really put sesame but just so you know how it taste like, it is very thick. The lobster was a disappointment. It seems like the lobster has a very high reputation about how awesome it is. I am not a cream person, so for me the whole thing is way to creamy, too heavy. I didn't even finish it. And honestly, lobster... The kind of food, even when you just steam it at home, it tastes delicious. I didn't taste any extra effort or the top 100 restro flavour within it. So if you love cream, you will love the course I assume. If you don't, then don't order it. So the main course 3/5

The dessert, the petite fruit thing is way toooo sweat. The ice cream is good but it is enough for two. So don't order one just for yourself lol it will be toooo much.  So dessert, 4/5

As for the service, doesn't match their title as the best restaurant in Canada. In between the main course and dessert, they kept us waited for 10-15 mins meanwhile only 4 tables are occupied. And the way they pushed you to use the sauce which I think they are very proud of is very unpleasant. And somehow we both think the waiters there are a bit over themselves as they crowned themselves as the best. And one more thing, which annoys me a lot is that we didn't finish the half chicken, so we asked to take out. And surprisingly, then I open the box back home, they just dumped the whole plate into the box including the finished chicken bones. Lol that is very low standard as take out packaging. So in terms of service, based on what we paid for, 1.5/5 

So overall I gave 3/5, and final words, yes indeed, it is ranked as the best in Canada and top 100 in the world, however based on my experience plus the reservation waiting time (3 mouths), I would say, there are so many other places to try in Montreal and you will have more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"WOW, we heard about this through recommendations before coming to Montreal. What a dining experience. Getting up to read the menu is an interesting experience, but our server Sarah was the shit and took care of us from start to finish. Its expensive but this should be your fancy experience in dining while in Montreal visiting.  Try the Hare it was delicious."}
{"text":"My first trip to Montreal where I was treated to dinner at JOE Beef.  We ordered the lobster spaghetti, duck, halibut and steak dish.  I would give 5 stars to the lobster and halibut and 4 to the others.  Ambience was great and the service was superb.  Don't forget to try their home grown salad.

Reserve your table early!  We made our reservations 3 months ago."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is a fantastic dining experience and one worthy of its reputation. This place is in high demand and it can take months to get reservations here unless you know someone or get incredibly lucky from an opening and sliding in from the wait list. In my case, I booked my dining experience 3 months ahead and even the day the date I wanted, I was only given the option of the 9:15 PM seating.

The incredible thing about this menu is that it's always changing and more than half the menu is different compared to what you read or look at pictures for. This is great in some ways and in other ways not so great if you want to try something you read or seen a picture of.

We went with Oysters and a Mozzarella di Buffalo plate that came with a nutty chutney sauce for appetizers and they were great. The mignonette sauce that came with the Oysters was soooo great! The chutney sauce mixes so nicely with its nutty and warm taste vs the silky smooth fresh mozzarella. Both were big hits for us.

For the main course we went with the plate for 2 Ribeye steak with side spaghetti squash and that plate knocked our socks off! That steak is baked to perfection and that squash made me re-think my opinion about squash. What. a. Plate!

For dessert we went with their signaturelayered cake and ice cream sandwich and they were both misses for us. My Ice cream was sickly sweet.

Service was great all night long, except for a late start. If my reservations are at 9:15... sitting down at 9:40 isn't an option. Don't allow that to happen. Our waiter was very good at his job and I marveled at his ability to remember the menu as well as he did.

So the price-tag... yeah... this is a $$$$$ meal. Nothing I can't afford on special occasions but be mindful of that.."}
{"text":"Definitely a food highlight of our Montreal trip! We got the lobster spaghetti and horse steak. Ahh, lobster spaghetti was soooo good. Spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and tossed in a light creamy sauce. It came with 1.5 lb of lobster which of course is delicious. I had my doubts about the horse steak but it was soooo good! It was wrapped in bacon...oh so tender and melted like butter in your mouth. It was served with a sunny side egg on top,  a side of sausage, and fries. A small place which got packed quickly but they do take reservations. The service is great here."}
{"text":"Named in honour of  \"Joe Beef\" McKiernan,  Joe Beef  has been voted Canada's best restaurant. Its owned by  two of Canada's most influential chefs,  David McMillan & Frédéric Morin. The menu is written on a black board and the waiting staff is more than happy to explain every dish to you. The ingredients are Québécois and Canadian but the wine list is French. Had to book a table six weeks in advance and it was So worth it. The food is top notch. We started with their home brewed Joe Beef pilsner. For entrees we ordered the Oysters & the Foie gras double down. The oysters were ok. The FGDD was f'in amazing. One of the best foie gras dishes I've ever had. For main we ordered the Lobster spaghetti & Horse steak. The Lobster spaghetti was really great, Perfectly cooked in a creamy sauce. The Horse steak was amazing too. Steak served with smoked meat & pork sausage.....and greens......Oh and Fries made in beef fat. OH YEAH. The desserts were awesome too. Can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu.

Food : AMAZING
Service :Friendly
Ambiance : Casual
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"You're darn right I ate horse. I ate horse steak with a horseradish horse sausage and a double down that made me hoarse from how much I indulged in it. 

A horse is a horse of course of course. And no one can talk to a horse of course. That is, of course, unless that horse is the famous Mr. Ed. 

That's a lie. I ate Mr. Ed. 

A horse is a course of course, and I can't talk with a mouthful of horse of course, because of course, that course of horse, was the wonderful Mr. Ed. 

Ed's dead, baby. Ed's dead."}
{"text":"This is food perfection. 

My wife and I had a trip booked here in the summer.   We had by fine meals every night but nothing touched Joe Beef.  

We had the best chanterelle mushrooms I have ever tasted the steak was out of this world, we did some smoked fish.  

The service was absolutely perfect.  They customize the menu /experience around what your after.  

This was one of the more memorable meals I have had. When we are back in Montreal we will be back"}
{"text":"This is it. The experience I've been waiting months and months for, and it did not disappoint. The food hit every mark. Everything was fabulous. The service was spectacular as well, and really put this place over the edge into true brilliance. 

As others have noted, there's no menus, only a blackboard with all the offerings of the night. But our server walked right up to us, sat on the bench next to me and said 'what would you like to eat tonight?' Making it clear that they were here for us, to make our night perfect. We answered that we didn't like making decisions, that we aren't picky, and really want to experience this place as it's supposed to be experienced. She was ecstatic and brought us several courses with different beverage pairings. The whole meal was custom-made. 

A raw seafood platter, a plate of raw root vegetables with lobster and a zucchini flour croquette filled with smoked eel (the dish of the night), quail with sour cherries, porchetta, and a berry dessert concoction with a meringue (now one of my all time favorite desserts I've had). Spectacular from start to finish. All dishes I wouldn't have thought to order. That's why I don't like to choose. Trust them. 

For two people, including beverage pairings, food, tax, and tip, the meal was about $336. A frakkin' steal, if you ask me. 

A lot of people just order the lobster spaghetti. As such, it's always on the menu. You don't come to a place like this to order that. I'm sure it's good, but it's the indulgent meal you expect. Try something new."}
{"text":"If you love foie gras and if you love it fried, this IS the place to go!!! We came here JUST to eat the double down that our friend so highly recommended. Seriously, if you have any heart issues, eat with caution. It's SOOOO freaking amazing and it will definitely give you heart burn. I suggest adding fries to soak up the duck fat rendered by this phenomenon. The table does come with bread, so you can use that too.

Every single bite of 2 fried foie gras, aged cheese, a little mayo and bacon was heavenly. Not only that, they brought out home made donuts with aged cheese on top.... very interesting. The donuts were very fresh and soft. The little bit of cheese made it a little savory, interesting and also will give you a heart attack if you haven't had it yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular - from the amazing, friendly service to the killer food!  Wow!  We called at 8pm on a Friday, asking for a 9pm reservation - and, although we ate at the bar, the experience was top notch.  Just so happened that we ate there the same night as Anthony Bourdain, so we knew it would be perfect.  The bartender/waiter was both friendly and knowledgeable, and helped us choose our starter and our steak (plus great wines by the glass and an outstanding dessert).  Based on his suggestion, we started with a full, chilled seafood platter; a ton of things, all great, including lobster salad, octopus salad, smoked salmon, huge shrimp, raw oysters, mussels, and salmon a couple different ways - oh, and crab and scallops and smoked char and a langoustine.  Mama Mia, it was tasty!  He then suggested we share the sirloin with a
side of fries.  The steak was huge and cooked to absolute perfection- do yourself a favor and share a steak.  Too much food for one human.  He chose an amazing desert for us, some layered cake concoction that was outstanding.  The owner (the Mrs) came over and talked with us for about 20 minutes; super nice and friendly.  This is a great place for dinner, with a hip vibe and the best steak and seafood I've had in a long time.  Bravo, Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"Seriously! On my top 10 restaurants in the world. I still dream about the lobster pasta! I would drive four hours into Montreal brave the border patrol just to eat at this restaurant again then go home."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is one of the highly-regarded restaurants in Montreal, owned by David McMillan, Frederic Morin, and Allison Cunningham.  Just note that reservations are required, as walk-ins are pretty much impossible (yes, they are THAT jam-packed and busy!).  A vintage-themed restaurant offering classic comfort foods, ranging from steak to pasta, it's a low-key, comfortable atmosphere with a Cheers-type of a vibe.  

The hubs and I had a late dinner reservation, and although we waited close to an additional 30-40 minutes for a table (they were that backed up), both of our frustration and annoyances suddenly disappeared - not because we were finally seated, but because the moment our seats were available, the evening was just perfect.  

We were set-up at the bar, and while I was curious to see why we weren't at a table, I found out why - I highly recommend in sitting up there, as they're literally the best seats in the house - you get the full action and full attention from the staff, who are all just UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME.  The staff - Mr. Leo, Ms. Alexandra, Mr. Lawrence (Mr. Larry), and Ms. Sarah - all were just so hilarious, oh-so-fun, had a great sense of humor, and really made us feel like VIPs, so welcomed and comfortable!  Mr. Leo explained every single aspect of the menu, made his recommendations and suggestions, and all the food came out at the appropriate time.  

We started off with some Eperlans Frites - whole-fried smelt with a side of creamy tartar sauce - these were super battered and crispy, and a great way to start off the night.  For our entrees, we had the Steak Ambassador Joe Beef (considered one of the restaurant's classics; fresh, thick-cut ribeye that was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare, a lovely au jus sauce, an herbed butter on top, and a side of the most delicious sauteed spinach we've ever tasted - cooked perfectly with the nice amount of garlic, this dish was filling!); and, another of the restaurant's classic, the Lobster Spaghetti (the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente - the sauce can be described as similar to carbonara, but not as thick and not as creamy - it was creamy enough where all the pasta were dressed; the lobster in the table were easy to pick out with the lobster 'toothpick' - it was luscious, juicy, and perfectly cooked - the hubs stated it was one of the best pasta dishes he's had, and I must agree!).  Don't forget the classic Marjolaine - this multi-layered hazelnut cake is just absolutely addicting - not too sweet, but decadent enough - great way to end a meal!!!  For drinks, we had a customized blood orange fizzy drink and a ginger drink - both were super delicious.  

The whole evening, we couldn't stop laughing - jokes, bantering, poking fun - all super laid-back, the staff treated us as we've been coming here for years and that we were just catching up as old friends.  

For Joe Beef and the staff, I would pack up and move to Montreal - it was literally one of the best evenings I've had :D :D :D  Make sure you don't miss this place - the wait is worth it! :D

{"text":"Folks - this is the best MTL or any town has to offer in terms of original quality food done with style! Check out the back for the resto's very own herb and vegetable garden. I also fell in love in this place so it will always remain special. I plan to return once back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Sat night walked in without a reservation. We flew in from NYC that afternoon and wanted to try the best of the best in Montreal. It seemed the bartender was training a new guy. Immediately asked if we spoke French. We don't but I do understand French. I can't respond fluently but can comprehend the language well after studying the language a bit and touring France. So basically trainer began to guide the trainee in the ways of boosting the check average and pushing us along. 
Whatever totally normal for a restaurant to make money but pretty unprofessional. 
We ordered cocktails both of which were very sweet. Not the classic bitter balanced style I prefer. 
We ordered oysters and the halibut and cheval entree. The bartender recommended the summer salad. 
Oysters were what you would expect. The salad we could have done without. It was very boring. The cheval I thought was cooked perfectly but I would just order a steak next time. The halibut was AMAZING. I would have that twice. So good! 
We had a layered cake for dessert I can't remember the name but it was delicious. 
The wines were perfectly chilled and our glasses were never empty. 
OverallI loved the charm of the restaurant the rustic style and ambience. I would return and recommend to anyone wanting a great meal."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Great.  Fantastic. Started with some of the best oysters that I've ever had, moved on to smoked eel croquettes, then literally the best beef tartare ever!!!  Wine selection in super unique.  Service is outstanding.  Rarely restaurants live up to the hype... Joe Beef might have surpassed it."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals my husband and I have ever had.  The service was amazing and the food was stellar.  We had veal tongue, veal shank osso bucco, and lobster spaghetti.  Everything was cooked to perfection and I drool thinking about the epic meal that we had."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the quality of the food, cocktails and service. The staff members were very knowledgeable about the menu and were able to make great recommendations out of the huge variety of offerings. 

I tried the following:
- foie gras: very gratifying and balanced in flavor
- quail: loved the stuffing and texture of the quail
- chicken terrine: this was okay only. 
- cod: this was very fresh and I really liked the bread crust on top of it. It was value for money though I would have preferred a more oily part of the fish.
- sundae and hazelnut cake: sundae was a flavor of pear imported  from Europe and topped with honey crumbs. The cake contained a dense layer of rich dark chocolate. Yumz.
- Manhattan cocktail: made with great Canadian rye

Highly recommend this restaurant and do sit at the bar if you can!"}
{"text":"OVERALL:
Fantastic!  I am from Chicago IL so you know we enjoy our food, the ambiance, and the experience.

I came to Montreal for the first time and truly enjoyed a French Experience here.

Our waitress was so helpful, kind and just a delight to have.  She walked myself and my boyfriend through the menu in English since it was written in French.  Everything is on a chalkboard wall that changes daily so it was a bit confusing trying to remember the different options, but I just chose one and was happy with the results.

Food:
I had sausage stuffed with a mixture of rabbit and other meaty goodness.  Sitting in Mash Potatoes, peas, and rich brown cream sauce.  My boyfriend had halibut with caviar and veggetables in a yellow cream sauce.  He thought it was just ok for the price (39).  While I enjoyed mine thoroughly and had enough for two days (35).  We also had an appetizer of two friend pieces of tofu stuffed with some sort of fruit chutney that was warmed.  It was truly divine.  And dont even get me started on the wine.  I had a lovely Sangiovese with a nice long finish.  Suggested by our waitress.

Service:
Did I mention she was great?

Food:
Dessert was...meh... a three layer cake with chocolate ganache in the middle.  A little dry but the ganache was good and served my sweet tooth after our meal.

Location
You are squished next to other people, but I could have cared less.  I felt like I was in grandmas dining room enjoying some fantastic home cooking.  The indoor space can probably fit 20-30 people squished together.  Outdoors can probably fit another 15-20.  Id get a seat outside if possible.  Be sure to make a reservation otherwise you wont get a seat.  And that is for indoor or outdoors.

If you are visiting Montreal just go.  Dont think about it.  Go!  I will go back when I visit again."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night for a late dinner. We were a little early so they had us wait at the bar. We decided to order a few cocktails. They were very quick and before we got our cocktails our table was ready.

Food & drinks: 
There was no printed menu for either drinks or food as far as we know! Menu & drinks are displayed on a black board in French. 

-Raw Bar 
we ordered oysters, scallops, and sea urchin. All the oyster were yumtastic and well cleaned. No grits here sir. Our favorite was from PEI called Colville. So good in fact we ordered more. 

Sea urchin was just OK. We like our sea urchin naked. Also east coast sea urchin has a very mild flavor so when they added apples and vinegar, you can barely taste the sea urchin. It's also very tiny it's not like west coast size. 

Scallops were fresh. The flavor was mild in comparison to larger raw scallops we've had. 

-Quail & End of Summer Salad
I combined two appetizer to make a main dish. I would not recommend the quail. the sauce is like eating meat and vinegar. I love pickled things but this was not my cup of tea.

The salad consisted of different leafy greens, shavings of squash and Parmesan. It served it's purpose for me which was to add some green to out meat fest. Other than that no particular recommendations about it. 

-Horse Steak (medium rare)
What love ordered was delicious, very well prepared meat. The steak came wrapped in bacon with an egg on top. On the side was sausage and garlic fries. All delicious. I'm glad he kept on feeding me his meal. 

-Drinks
People were having cocktails and a lot were having Manhattans and Moscow Mules. We jumped on the band wagon. Overall ok not a bad choice. Next we ordered bourbon cinnamon sour and a Robert Roy. I preferred the bourbon. Love had a Beaujolais that went very well with his meal. I had a Burgundy Aligote Chardonnay. 

Service:
Man the service was slow at first we sat down around 9:45pm. I think we next saw our waitress at 10:30pm. We were all good with waiting because we're new yorkers we realize we're on a new york minute and try to be polite when we're traveling. We TRY! We couldn't wait any more because the waitress left us dry. Alcohol makes any wait easier so if it's going to be slow service at least give us that to do! It got much better when the waitress observed us to be annoyed and thirsty. 

She definitely made up for lost time which we appreciated. She also was very graceful about our mild tantrum which was also appreciated. 

Thanks Joe Beef we left well fed and a bit tipsy I must say. Mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"Book your RSVP well in advance, everything on the menu is seriously to-die-for!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome meal but even more EXCELLENT deserts.

Some of the BEST DESERTS I've ever had. Unique deserts.

TIP: Take someone here, and watch their face when they experience the DESERTS and then let them in on the secret that you knew they were mind blowing.

:)"}
{"text":"Of course in Montreal, you must come to Joe Beef. It's no frills, but deeply romantic and dimly lit.  It's hard to get a ressie here so plan ahead.  My hubby and I came here at 9pm on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy actually.   Our server was excellent - they don't have a menu per se, well they do but it's on a dimly chalkboard and in french so we had to lean on our server a lot for help. Not only did he run through a text book of dishes and preparation by memory, but he in fact chose our dinner for us. Considering their portions are quite large, they can modify different portion sizes to optimize your meal. We let our server run wild and we had: 

- delicious artichokes and goat cheese, spread like a tapenade atop toast 
- zucchini flowers fried with sturgeon, delicious and unique. A bit salty? Still tasted light with a good aioli. 
- braised rabbit (very tender like chicken) with delicious eggplant that was perfectly stewed and in such a flavorful tomato sauce 
- perhaps my favorite course. A half portion of the lobster spaghetti - creamy lobster bisque sauce with bacon and deliciously tender lobster claw and tail. So so so good
- the main course was the lamb neck which was prepared in so many different ways: as a chop, thick slab of bacon, and stewed tender. I don't love lamb but this was a unique preparation; my husband loved it.  It definitely has That strong lamb
Flavor though; great for lamb lovers. It was good, lamb is just not my fave. But to our server's point - it's much easier to get s good steak or beef and harder to get lamb.  He was so great, made
Such good choices for us. 

Hubby had the house beer, a non weak Pinot noir, and I some fuller bodied French wine.   We shared the classic hazelnut cake which was so nutty and delicious with a chocolate ganache.  Tender and moist. Yummy with our cappuccino. 

Best place we ate at in Montreal; worth the hype."}
{"text":"I have a vegan friend.  She's a great person, but sometimes a bit preachy.  If I ever get angry with her, I'm inviting her to Joe Beef.  I think she'd spontaneously combust after reading the menu.

The thing I love about Montreal restos is that they don't need to try hard by having a fancy dining room and vertical presentations that defy logic - they let the food speak for itself.  We went with a group of 4 on a Tuesday night: it was packed, but they seated us pretty quickly (we did have reservations 3 weeks in advance).  

The group I went with were all foodies - and we wanted to sample a bit of everything.  We started off with Caesar's and Pimm's Cups with two dozen oysters.  The Caesar was basically a meal unto itself: served with a perfectly shucked oyster and lobster tail (it was actually a shrimp but it was pretty massive).  

For appetizer I ordered their foie gras double down - I was ambitious and ordered the larger portion.  The concept of it sold me even before I took a greasy/fat-filled/artery clogging bite, and it certainly delivered.  We shared a giant arugula/herb salad which cut the grease quite well.  For entree I ordered the horse.  Alot of the horse I eat tends to be tough and game-y (lick the barn yard floor game-y), but what arrived could have just as easily been 50 day aged Kobe.  Only qualm is that the portion was so big I couldn't finish it - thankfully my table-mates helped out. 

My only issue with the whole experience is that it took a while for food to arrive, but their giant Caesar's more than made up for that.  God speed Joe Beef - I'll be back soon... after going on a diet."}
{"text":"The Lobster Spaghetti was delicious!  Fresh lobster, a lobster infused cream sauce, bacon and perfectly cooked al dente noodles made it one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.

We also had the double down (bacon and cheddar sandwiched by deep fried foie gras).  This was also very good, but very rich.  Get a half order.

This place is a definite must when visiting Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"hands down the best restaurant i've ever been to. i have dreams about this place. i wish they would open one in los angeles, but it probably wouldn't be nearly as good."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. We sat outside in the vegetable garden. Weather was perfect. We got three plates and shared all three starting with the clam and vegetable salad followed by the lamb pasta (the best pasta I've ever had) and then the Halibut with lobster and clams. The meal was a 10 out of 10. When visiting Montreal this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"***My 100th REVIEW!*** 
This is one of the best restaurants that I have EVER been to. It was more casual than I expected but it was welcomed! I love the juxtaposition of such a great menu in a casual setting and we sat at the bar! We started with the Horse Tartare... It was so tender and flavorful! We went on to oysters on the half shell that they shuck at bar! We didn't get any bread, though the people next to us did but no biggie! The bar was a community in and of itself. The awesome patron next to me  gave me bite of his foie gras #LOVE. For an entree we shared the lobster spaghetti! It's a 1.5 lb lobster atop a flavorful cream sauce. This was one of the two best meals I had in the city and we were there for almost a week! The bartenders were nice and very helpful about helping us with suggestions of things to do around town!  Do not miss Joe Beef and make sure to get your reservation in three to four weeks before heading in!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what this place is all about. Just a hype they think their special! Not"}
{"text":"Joe Beef is awesome. Prior to coming to Montreal for a weekend I had done some research and all signs pointed to JB. What sealed the deal was David Chang saying he thought it was the best restaurant in the world. We got 930 reservations at the bar and it ended up being a fantastic experience because the bar tender (also our waiter) was brilliant. He was excited about the food, funny, let us try as many wines as we wanted and overall made the experience. My wife and I don't speak French but he escorted us to the chalkboard menu and in the midst of bustling waiters and moving patrons he read the entire menu for us with out any rush or impatience - just amazing service. I had a couple of glasses of wine that might and my wife tried one of the speciality Father's Day cocktails which was gin based, crushed ice, lime, seltzer and some other light ingredients - great drink. We ordered the lettuce salad (which was fresh and crisp using vegetables plucked right out of the backyard garden). We had homemade frank and asparagus salad which was also excellent - the franks snapping and full of flavor. Then - yes - we got the half double down. I've read the David McMillan actually created it as a joke and that he thinks it's disgusting. However lovely bacon and cheddar sandwiched between two pieces of deep fried fois gras in just the right amount of maple syrup is wonderful and NOT disgusting. I suppose the idea of it is gluttonous - but whatever - te amo. For our main we ordered the glorious lobster spaghetti - which is so rich and flavorful and the lobster so perfectly cooked that we devoured every last bite. Good that we shared. For desert we took our fantastic waiters recommendation of the Yule Log which was layered with soft strawberry short cake, pistachio an then had little strawberries cut topped like trees and merengue mushrooms. Sooooo good. The music of the evening was reggae and hip-hop and it was never too loud to overtake  conversation but you could still hear enough to rap to Juicy by Biggie (well at least I could). Great, evening at a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Had dinner for a special occasion.  Everything we ordered was great!  Lobster was to die for.  The only thing that was average was the wine but that sometimes varies anyway.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Joe Beef is really freakin' good.  It's been about 2 months since I've eaten there while vacationing in Montreal and I still think fondly back on it.

The menu rotates pretty often - but for what it's worth - we grabbed the whole flounder with lobster bisque gravy (came with a side of mussels and lobster cream sauced veggies), slow-cooked lamb neck with sausage, seared scallops and foie gras parfait.

Other than the scallops (which was fresh and perfectly cooked, but definitely hard to break the mold), everything else was exceptional.  The weirdest thing was the foie gras parfait - which was raw foie gras whipped with egg yolks and paired with tart (rather than sweet) cherries and cherry jam.  It was very strange (seriously, foie for a 'dessert' appetizer) but it worked.  It came in a big bowl so whatever we didn't have on the bread was added as a topping to everything else.  I wish the lamb neck was a bit gamier, but still excellent.  Finally, the flounder was spectacular.

Service was excellent.  We were immediately seated after confirming our reservation (if you are planning a trip - do make reservations well in advance).  The service was atypical - friendly but very relaxed.  The menu board is extremely difficult for non-French speakers to read due to the dim lights.  Our waiter just told us he recommended 'everything' but was very knowledgeable, answered all our questions and gauged our appetites well as he told us to stop ordering as he was confident we had 'more than enough' food and he was right.  He really steered us to configure an optimal meal that satisfied everyone at the table considering some unique dietary restrictions.

Also, the meal was surprisingly affordable.  With everything mentioned and two beers, the bill came to $65 each for the four of us - tax and tip included.

Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Canada."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, and the food was amazing. Our waiter was great, and the place was nice and cozy. Only thing that was annoying was that the menu was on a board, and it was all in French."}
{"text":"When in Montreal you have to eat at Joe Beef..one of the best experience yet!!"}
{"text":"This place is everything it's reputed to be.  We scored seats at the bar a day or two before our trip, and it was such a treat. Great wine and beer, fantastic silvertail appetizer, lobster spaghetti, lamb special, amazing desserts. Go here. And then go to Liverpool House next door."}
{"text":"We came from Toronto, both having worked at reputable restaurants there. We were excited to try Joe Beef as we saw it featured on David Chang's Mind of a Chef and Bourdain's Parts Unknown. We made a reso three months in advance. At first we enjoyed the casual fine dining experience - servers dressed laid-back but were also attentive to details like wiping crumbs off the table after each course. The server directed us to the lobster spaghetti and the Joe Beef steak. Our server was very into up-selling ie. we asked for a $100 bottle of wine and he insisted on a $150 bottle of wine. The food came quickly for this price point - there was no pre-dinner linger to chat and enjoy drinks. We understand some people don't like this but we do. The food wasn't overwhelmingly rich rather subtle flavours and delicious. The disappointment was when we ordered the lobster spaghetti - a portion of the lobster was black which our server immediately took the the kitchen. They apologized, we began sharing the steak as they prepared what we assumed would be a new pasta. They actually used the meat from the original pasta (unshelled) and just re-tossed it all - not what we would have expected when ordering a $50 pasta. By the time it arrived we had finished the steak and were pretty full already - breaking up the flow of this 5 star dinner. We finished with coffees and dessert. The bill was $350 and they didn't so much as comp us for two coffees. Any restaurant should compensate a mistake even with something as small as free coffee and a dessert and this is speaking from our own experience in the industry. From a distance we could see the 5 star experience but the unwillingness to be accountable left us feeling underwhelmed with the whole experience. Enough so that we won't be returning again which is a shame as we visit the city a couple times a year. We're sure people go there and have a great experience, unfortunately we wouldn't go back as Joe Beef doesn't seem to be the kind of restaurant that guarantees that experience."}
{"text":"It lives up to its reputation. 

Incredible service, atmosphere, and of course food.  

This is what all chefy-casual (you know the type- dark candlelit room, chalkboard menu)  restaurants aspire to be."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night around 8:30 with no reservation and we were sat immediately at the bar in the second room. Our server was welcoming and very knowledgeable. We told him to create a menu for us, as we wanted the best of what they offered being as though this was our first trip to Montreal. The experience was nothing short of amazing. My dining partner and I agreed this was one of our best dining experiences EVER. You need to go here."}
{"text":"Joe Beef - Montreal. Wow. 
Coming with a very heavy weight - this may have been one of the best dinners of my life. Not just because it's a foodie maven hotspot. Not just because Joe Beef has won so many awards, and draw so much attention. Simply because the food offered was so far and above!  The staff gained excitement with mine, and wanted to offer me more and more.  Their suggestions were made with such enthusiasm, it was almost as if they were pre-enjoying it for me.   There was without a question a New Orleans \"lagnaippe\" (a little something extra) sense to the entire experience. Far exceeded any possible expectation, especially since the word is out.   How many times has someone told you about a place and pumped it up to the highest level, only to end up leaving the restaurant disappointed and scratching your head wondering what the hell they were talking about???  This simply was not the case.  Purely amazing. Pure expertise. Wild creativity.  Pure professionalism. 99.9999999556 out of 100. You have wow'd the un wow'able."}
{"text":"I've been to joe beef about 3 times now. The first time I went , it deserved a 5 stars , the 2nd time I went a 5 as well , the reason I gave it a 4 on the 3rd time was because the food was actually not that great. I was so so surprised being such a big fan. Joe beef is one of those places where things seemed to be seasoned to perfection but for once in my life it was extremely over seasoned . It was salty to the point where it was quite painful to eat. I will definitely still come back because I consider it one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Sara: 5/5
Suk: 4/5

Not sure what stars were aligning on our last visit to Montreal but we were able to get into both of our first picks by calling day of.

Friday = Joe Beef

Joe Beef = Everything you have heard and more 

Everything you have heard and more = gluttony without apology.  

Our last minute reso's meant we were seated at the bar.  This may be a negative to some but for us was a big bonus as bar seating tends to be our preference.  

I forget our bartenders name but he was fantasticly fantastic.    Due to our bar seating, it was difficult to read the menu (regardless of it being in French) so rather than strain our necks and our memories of high school French, we had a conversation with the bar man about what we like/don't like.  

What resulted was a meal we will never forget   Ever   

Oysters, yum.  

Pigs Head, what?   Redonculous amazing - if it is on the menu when you are there, do yourself a favour and eat it regardless of squeamishness.  I thought I would have a hard time with it and didn't.   It was one of the best things I have ever consumed.  Ever.   Like ever.  

Beef tongue, what?  For us, this was too much of a literal presentation as it was presented as it had existed.  A large tongue presented on a plate.   Visually, there was no denying we were about to eat a cow tongue.  We had told our barman we would be okay with it so we felt completed to eat it.   Essentially, it tasted like a dense beef hot dog so it wasn't terrible but it was just way too big of a portion for two people to finish.    Perhaps this was amplified by the fact that a 1/4 of the way through I realized I was using my tongue to eat and taste the the equivalent of another animal.   I am not going to lie, there was an element of gag.   Maybe a little too \"farm to table\"  for my enjoyment but that is my hypocrisy, not Joe Beefs.  

Veg time!!!!   Pastrami carrots.  Delicate thin carrot slices marinated in pastrami spices.   Yes please.   Every single day, yes please.  

Foie gras.  This is where the unapologetic gluttony becomes a CAPITAL statement.  This is also where Suk deviated from the best meal of his life to get me the f out of here.  So perfect and rich.  Our barman doubled up our portion of the foie and although it was so delicious, it was too ample and rich for us to end our meal with (says Suk)

Our experience at Joe Beef was fantastic, from the service to the atmosphere to the food.    It is rare restaurants with this type of notoriety deliver on their promise.  Joe Beef killed it   Thank you."}
{"text":"Sensational. But first, word of warning: make a reservation. As tourists coming to Montreal for the first time, we tried in vain to book a table online for the one weekend we would be in town. Unfortunately, there wasn't a table free for another few months after our visit to the city. Months! So instead, I called the restaurant on a weekday prior to our trip, requested a table, and landed a reservation for a table by the bar. Lesson learned: if you can't get a table online, call them!

Second, the food. The menu is totally in French but the servers all speak English, so ask questions! They'll be happy to answer you. We ordered a variety of items - the sturgeon croquettes, steak, the cod in a cream sauce, a side salad (which is enormous, by the way), hazelnut cake, and drinks. Everything was delicious - the steak and cod were the standouts and perfectly cooked. Comfort food at its best, and quality is top-notch. 

Overall, Joe Beef, while heavy on the wallet, is very unpretentious, casual, boisterous with a very intimate, home-style atmosphere. There's a reason for the rave reviews, and if you're in town, whether tourist or local, I'd definitely recommend this spot. 

For two people, with tax, tip, drinks, our total was around $154.00."}
{"text":"Decadent is the best way I can think of to describe the food at Joe Beef. Love the decor and chalkboard menu, and the service was great. ! I did have to save up some $$ to afford a full meal (appy, entree, dessert, and wine) but it was more than worth it..where else will you find a foie gras double down?! It's food heaven, but not for those on a diet."}
{"text":"We went there just because Tony  Bourdain went there and he loved it.  Well Tony you did us dirt!  This place is for people who like to think they are cool and like to be seen being what they think is cool.  We started with a tomato soup that was flat in flavor and tasteless with raw crunchy slices of tomatoes placed in it.  But that was not the worsted of it.  It was served luke warm  with a chunk of brie,, oh but there is more, the rind  was still on eeeuuuu, omg it was gross!  We ordered the big New York steak ... Dont bother talk about false advertising this is more like a  top round of the lowest quality.  It was not edible, you just chew and chew and chew.  If you enjoy beef gum this is the steak for you, but lay in some dental floss cause boy you will need it.  Service was something out of a fast food restaurant hurried and careless.  For us this by far has won the #1 bad meal of the last 5 years.  Up side they sat us in the garden area which was cool temp wise and very pleasant if I had known the best food in the house was in those pots growing besides me not only would I have saved a bucked to cash, but had a better meal."}
{"text":"It's just so so. Not worth the money. 
Seafood platter was fresh. Everything else was either too bland or too salty. 
Had cod as main dish, no flavour at all. So bland."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's not on the menu but ask for the Lobster Pasta. It's the best!

Also be wary, the portions of meat are huge but come with no sides. So figure out a way to share your food with your friends and you'll get more value for your money since it's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Pros 
Super awesome place the decor is relax like I'm at the country cottage .Food is superb everything melts in my mouth.
Cons 
Price is decent but ask for the off menu specials they can be good but super pricey."}
{"text":"My favorite part about the meal was the Bloody Mary. Delicious drink and was served with an oyster and shrimp. Delicious! 

Tried the double down.  It was good.  I recommends
 Getting the small version.  The flavors are there, very rich, but not craveable.

Lobster spaghetti, no thank you.  Cost a fortune and the lobster is chewy and tastes like its just tossed with some cream.  Lemon helped.

Veal tongue was pretty bleh. Chewy boring dish,  kinda mad about that one! 

The atmosphere was fun and unique, but as for \"pushing the envelope\" I was pretty bored."}
{"text":"As recommended by another Yelper... We came with very high expectations.  They exceeded our expectations!!  

Last minute reservations are hard to make, so were happy to sit at the bar... which I recommend.  We started with the escargot soup... blew our minds.  The greens were from the garden behind the restaurant. The steak was amazing.  Their Joe Beer beer was a perfect compliment.  The service was professional, cordial and answered all our questions.  (Thanks Ludovic).

Go!"}
{"text":"I LOVED our waitress! She was so friendly and down-to-earth. 

- I made my reservations 3 months in advance (that's the earliest you can make it) 
- It's a dimly-lit, tiny restaurant, very homey and intimate 
- They played some great music while we were there (biggie smalls and some frenchy music)
- The menu is written on the chalkboard (behind people sitting in the restaurant) - just take a picture with your smart phone and look at the menu from your seat instead of cranking your neck around and struggling to read it 
- The waitress encourages you to get up from your seat to look at the menu and she can answer any questions or give you recommendations 
- Duck for 2 ($90) is HUGE and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It comes with 2 pieces of foie gras and a duck leg (confit), and like a whole freakin duck. It was SO good. We couldn't finish and I was really sad. HUGE portions. 
- Corn chowder was delicious too 
- For dessert, I picked ice cream with concord grapes - it was very good. 
- I also got to pick at my neighbor's cake (we became friends after sitting so close for 2 hours) - 12 layers of buttercream 

As with any other French restaurants in Montreal, your meal will probably last 2 hours or longer."}
{"text":"Food and service was top notch. We are from New York, so our french is not good. I wish that they had a menu in English to choose from. Our waiter spoke great English but we couldn't memorize all the items they listed. They do not provide menus on purpose. Instead, all items are on a wall on a chalk board and are only in french. 

We suggest trying to get a seat outside, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Well there's nothing to say about Joe Beef except when you arrive there you'd better have reservations or else you will NOT get in. The decor is a rustic, country, down home kind of feel and the staff are wonderful. One person in particular is Sara. She's very bubbly, high energy, welcoming, warm, and honestly I felt like I've known her for a long time within minutes of speaking with her. She made the whole experience awesome for my husband and I. We had the Lobster spaghetti and the rabbit dish the Sara recommended and we were floored on how delicious the food was. Just the right amount to keep us satisfied throughout the rest of the night. All of the staff were very nice and very accommodating. I will go there again without a doubt. I can't stress this enough reservations is a must."}
{"text":"I made reservations at Joe Beef a month prior for my boyfriend's birthday. The reservation was on a Thursday night at 7:30pm. We got there on time and the hostess said that our table would not be ready for another 30 minutes so we decided to go have a drink at a bar while waiting for our table. We felt like the waitress should of offered a complimentary cocktail or dessert for making us wait that long. This is the reason why I did not rate it five stars.

We started with the pork pate and a foie gras parfait. Both of the appetizers had wonderful flavours and we were really happy with them. For our main, we got the lobster spaghetti and it was the best lobster spaghetti I've ever had! My boyfriend had the lamb steak and the portion was very generous. We also got bloody caesars which were topped with shucked oysters. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed eating at Joe Beef and would love to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at the bar at 9:30pm
the place was jammed but it probably always feels like that since it is so small. The outdoor patio is impressive but mostly their garden, it is crazy! It's huge and it makes you feel good as you know you will be eating fresh from their backyard!
The staff is very nice and the food is great.
WE had oysters from PEI, wish there were more choice but at least they were fresh!
We were served cocktails from jar, original.
We tried the chichitos which were excellent, and also the amazing beignes dipped in maple syrup with house smoked cheddar melting all over them!! Mmmmm!!! It was delicious.
We didn't eat much because I noticed that the plates were overwhelming, meaning way too much food!!! Not the typical french restaurant portion. 
Personally, I prefer to try several small plates than 1-2 large one and feel stuffy.
I will go back and thanks to Nic for the excellent service.
PS Be careful, there is a bison in the bathroom!!"}
{"text":"A quick little blurb about why we even came to Montreal. It was a weekend, I was parked on the couch not feeling hot and waiting for my wife, then girlfriend, to head on over. Bored, I flipped on the TV and what do I see but Anthony Bourdain and these two guys ice fishing in Montreal on an episode of \"Parts Unknown.\" I watch for a few more seconds and almost had to sit up when I see what David McMillan and Fred Morin are cooking. Food I had never tasted but had to, wine I had never drank but had to, and suddenly, as the episode kept going, I thought \"wait, why the hell wouldn't we visit Montreal?\" As the months passed, I was able to show the episode to another friend of ours who was like \"I'm in!\" So, doing our homework and seeing the Vice episode as well as The Layover, we felt we got a pretty good read on places to eat and immediately started booking lunches and dinners months in advance. My only other experiences in Canada were way up north on fishing trips my father arranged where you're dropped off for a week a hundred miles from civilization so this was going to be a completely different.

We made sure to book 2 dinners at Joe Beef, a night at Nora Gray, a night at PDC, and lunches at L'Express, Toque, and just walked into Dominion Tavern on an unplanned day. 

But back to Joe Beef. Lordy. This was one of those places where I was so excited to try the food that I felt as if there was no way it could live up to expectations. Like all of us wetting our pants when we saw the Phantom Menace trailer years ago and then confused as all hell for days that it was so bad. Joe Beef was NOT the Phantom Menace. Joe Beef was flat out amazing. The ambiance, the service, the food...my god, the food. 

Night One: We were a foursome and on night one, from what I can remember, we started with the ham and cheese croquettes as well as a soup and of course, great wine. Our server, Alexandra, was totally down to earth and friendly, great with suggestions and checked on us all the time. For entrees, my wife had the Lobster Spaghetti Homard and I had a huge steak. The one thing that I noticed right off the bat, not just about Joe Beef, but all throughout the restaurants we tried, was that they know how to cook meat in Montreal. I devoured the whole thing. My wife had me try the Lobster Spaghetti and I ended up finishing the final third of hers as well. I immediately knew what my entree would be for night 2. After going through our 2nd bottle of wine, I moved onto dessert which was, if I'm correct, a sour cream ice cream and sorbet mix with fruit. It was huge. I didn't know what to expect when I heard \"sour cream ice cream\" but I figured \"These guys aren't listed as one of the best on the planet cause they screw up.\" I tore through it pretty quickly.

As we were ending night one, three hours later, I had mentioned in passing to Alexandra that \"I've never tried oysters and I see your boss talking about them all the time.\" She walked away and as I was rubbing my gut, knowing I could not eat anymore, she came back, an oyster and an evil grin. \"We have to see you eat one now.\" The whole table watched me, including my wife who thought \"there is no way in hell he will handle this texture.\" I put the horseradish and lemon in it and down it went. I was converted. 

Night Two: The very next night, we were back again. This time, Patrick was our server and gave us the best seat in the house, right up front in the window, which my wife was able to get a really memorable photo of as well. 

Patrick, just like Alexandra, was amazing. So attentive, so informative, so great with the food and wine pairings. We started with the croquettes again but this time, \"Bring us a plate of oysters.\" Those were taken out within minutes. My wife just watched in awe, not believing I actually liked them. The night before, Alexandra had actually mentioned to us \"I can get a bucket of oysters and a bottle of white wine and I'm perfect.\" I would have to agree with her way of thinking. Then Patrick brought us a few things to try. One being calamari stuffed with lobster sausage. Amazing. 

Then the entrees arrived. My wife and I switched, she having the steak I had the night before and myself the lobster spaghetti homard. Again, like machines, we went through them, with another bottle of wine. I could eat a meal like this every day...but I'd be 500lbs. We ended the night again with the sour cream ice cream and sorbet and I had a  Another 3 hour Joe Beef marathon completed. 

In a very nice gesture, David McMillan, who was still on vacation, noticed our tweets that we had checked in and were raving about the place, and sent a couple nice notes on Twitter about not being able to meet. These guys are so down to earth and not only does it come through in their restaurant but their staff is exactly the same. Don't worry, sir. Besides loving Montreal, your restaurant is literally one of the best on the planet. We'll be back again for sure...and again."}
{"text":"Amazing! We traveled from Florida to Montreal to sample some of the restaurants, and Joe Beef was on our list. This place is wonderful. They offer four star cuisine in an intimate and low key atmosphere. The food is outstanding as are the cocktails. Additionally, the customer service is truly excellent and one of the main reasons why I hope to return. This place is a four star restaurant with a down to earth vibe that sets a precedent for the surrounding venues. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is insanely good. Worth the $400 hotel bill we spent just to come to Montreal for the weekend to eat here. It's everything I've ever wanted food to be - somehow every bite of every dish was perfectly salty, perfectly sweet, melt in your mouth just daaaaamn. I can't stress that enough. And I was blown away by the service, everyone was so attentive and had great personalities, playful yet professional vibes abounded.

And they had gluten free spaghetti noodles! They were hands down the best this celiac has ever had. My traditional Italian food lover boyfriend actually said he would eat gf pasta every time if we could get them. Sadly, they are made in house and not available for purchase, but one of our helpful servers provided a replacement recommendation. 

If I could save up the money I would come here every year for an anniversary of eating the best damn food I've ever had by eating more fantastic food.

We split 3 entrees between us two: a half serving of the lobster spaghetti, the blue cheese NY strip loin (with amazing fries) and the rabbit sausage. I recommend all of them, and to let the servers decide your wine pairings. You're in good hands."}
{"text":"Joe Beef provided me with the best meal I have ever had in Montreal.  The establishment is dark and intimate.  The service was very friendly and knew the menu well.  Rumor has it that this is where David Chang likes to go when in town.  (This probably is most likely the case since he wrote the introduction for the Joe Beef cookbook)  The dishes have some Momofuku-like attributes but its unfair to compare Joe Beef to Chang's restaurant group.  They are similar in the way foods are paired or as I like to say mashed up; like the musical genre

When I think back to the food Joe Beef served us it make me imagine this is the type of food a cook would serve to guest in his home.  We started with fresh oysters that spoke for themselves.  My large group doubled down on the double down foie gras;  we ordered two of the entrees that sandwiched bacon and cheese between to pieces of lightly battered and fried foie.  This was pretty ridiculous and good.  I thought the foie was a bit over done.  The eel nuggets were nice but failed to excite.  The best starter for me was the clams, riz and squid.  The squid stuffed with rice reminded me of being in Spain.  Tentacles gently placed inside the opened clams completed the great presentation.

The Cote du Boeuf for two was a bone in rib eye steak served Peter Luger style cut and served with spoons to serve each person.  Bone marrow and a potato, sort of au gratin, accompanied the dish.  The grass fed beef spoke for itself but came out closer to the medium side.  We didn't specify temperature.  Maybe it was my fault for assuming unless otherwise specified beef comes out medium rare.  Lobster and spaghetti featured perfectly cooked lobster mixed in with a bit of pasta in a very light cream sauce.  Although I appreciate the bite of al dente pasta I thought Joe Beef's could have been cooked more.  The star of the meal for me was the crab stuffed whole artic char.  This was one of the best things I have eaten this year and the reason why I will try to make it back to Joe Beef the next time I am in Montreal.

We tried each of the deserts.  A take on a backed potato that consisted of two meringues was forgettable.  The carrot cake was very good.  The sorbet was maybe the best sorbet I have ever tasted.  The worst part about the experience was the terrible, terrible espresso.  It was like if someone brewed the most bitter coffee they could find then squeezed a lemon in it.  It was so bad that the fellas and me ended up going somewhere near by for a digestive.

The meal had some ups and downs but all together it was a stellar meal.   This was a great place and meal for a group of six guys celebrating a birthday.  There was a group of older gentlemen behind us doing the same.  The only other thing I can advise is that Joe Beef only has to seatings; one at 7p and another at 9:30p."}
{"text":"We've done a foodie tour of Montreal this week for our 20th anniversary. Brasserie T!, Au Pied de Cochon, Joe Beef and Le Bremner.  Joe Beef was fine, but not great. And it certainly didn't live up to the price food or service-wise. It seems to be riding on the hype a bit. The food was good, but we didn't swoon over any dish. The service was good when we had their attention, but forgetful and missing details in between those times. Le Bremner has been the huge stand out with regard to creativity and delight with food. Boris Bistro has also been a great lunch find (we've returned several times for their Charcuterie Maison)."}
{"text":"Tip #1: Get Andy to be your server.  This girl is AWESOME. 

Joe Beef is notorious for its hype and reviews.  I was lucky enough to snag a reservation and boy, are we glad we got that reservation.  Like my tip above, we were greeted by our wonderful server, Andy, who apparently just started at Joe Beef.  Andy took us through the menu and talked about recommendations of what to eat and described each dish for us.  

We ended up ordering the smoked meat croquettes (must eat), beef tartare, a beet tart (OMG YES, get that), a mackerel dish with caviar (yes yes yes!), lobster ravioli, fries, and a rum cake.  

We. Regret. NOTHING. 

Everything was so fantastic from start to finish.  And the service we received from Andy was stellar.  She was funny, professional, and made awesome recommendations.  

Joe Beef is definitely worth the hype and starred on our list of places that one MUST eat at in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I hesitate at times to add my voice to well patronized,reviewed and popular restaurants simply because my fellow Yelpers are so eloquent and comprehensive already but.....

Joe Beef is really as good as they all say.
Service was excellent as we placed our meal and drink selections totally in our waitresses hands. Duck confit,porterhouse,endive salad,PEI oysters,soft serve ice cream and 2 paired wines later we left sated and very happy with a doggy bag even.....

Go....it's really that good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, honestly. Anthony Bourdain had recommended it on his show. The menu changes daily and the food is quite delicious. Great place for foodies. Food is exotic and exciting; not for the faint of heart. Service was great as well (Isabel was awesome). Please note, this restaurant gets booked weeks in advance. Please reserve accordingly."}
{"text":"Wow we got a reservation- Top 50 in the world.

The restaurant is classy, super friendly and knowledgeable staff and of course great food.

I loved their Oysters. - You must have this.

Rib eye steak-  good

Char Fish with Swiss chard inside. and muscles on top wow that was good. 

Ask the waiter for desert recommendations."}
{"text":"This place is seriously cool, laid back, fantastic, and filled with the best waitstaff and bartenders I have ever had the pleasure to dine with. 

What a pleasure, Leo the bartender was awesome with the beer and food selections. Even went to the kitchen to ask for an off the menu item. To my surprise Frederice Morin comes out to chat and make sure I got what I came for. Chatted with me for at least an hour and gave me s cook book. 

What a place. One of the best meals I've had in my life."}
{"text":"not the best in town anymore! first, opened late and left dozen clients out in the street for 15 minutes.  then rushed our dinner without asking how to prepare the entree and came out rare and uncooked, only to be brought back and returned in same manner.  top that off with only below shelf alcohol, so not worth the visit. for an excellent all around meal and service try garde manger where we had the best meal in montreal."}
{"text":"A.ma.zing. They got a number of things amusingly wrong, and yet they earned 5 of my stars. The negatives: We had reservations at the bar for 9:30 on a Friday night, but we weren't seated until 10:30. We ordered 10 oysters (which would mean 11 by their throw-in-one-extra way with oysters) but we got 9. My date ordered the 8 oz sirloin but was served the 16 oz. The positives: they gave us a couple glasses of interesting, delicious wine to ease the wait. All the staff were super in their demeanor and knowledge. The oysters were delicious and the homemade cocktail sauce like nothing I've had before. I ordered the duck steak au poivre and it was, comment dit-on, perfect. My date ordered the aforementioned sirloin, which he says was perhaps the best steak of his life. It was served with wilted greens and a sauce I can best describe as a cross between A1 and chutney. And they charged only for the 8 oz since the upsizing was their mistake. 

It's cozy crowded noisy happy. 

I would definitely recommend it and go back if I'm ever again in Montreal."}
{"text":"Joe Beef was an incredible dining experience and has usurped Le Bernardin as my favorite restaurant. Everything was spot on. From the moment you arrive to the moment you depart, you're treated like family. The menu can be overwhelming, but our waitress sat down and helped us craft an entire meal complete with wine. The food was great. I wouldn't say it was mind blowingly good but it was delicious nonetheless. The menu changes daily based on what's available at the local farmers market so you know you're eating fresh ingredients from a constantly changing menu. Very unique, though they do have some staple items like their famous steak and lobster pasta. 

It honestly felt like I was eating at a friend's place and enjoying a decadent meal with a few close friends (with the wine pouring of course). Our waitress was gregarious. She engaged everyone, joked with people, drank and toasted with us and genuinely made us feel like we were long lost friends. It was so much fun. The ambience, decor, music, and service was absolutely perfect. 

In the end we had 2 starters, 1 side salad, 1 main, 1 dessert and 4 glasses of wine for $200 CAD or like $150/60 USD."}
{"text":"Had the local 1/2 snow crab, 2 sea urchin, lettuce salad, heacheese and pickled fennel salad, and the schnitzel trout. The sauces included with the snowcrab were excellent and the sea urchin was some of the best I've ever had. We sat at the bar and  enjoyed interacting with the excellent staff throughout the evening. We also loved the intimate setup of the restaurant, the low lighting, and decor."}
{"text":"I've been holding on to my Joe Beef experience because humans, especially those with OCD, place an unreasonable amount of significance on round numbers. When I realized I was coming up on my 250th review, I figured I would save the honor for what I consider to be one of the top five dining experiences in my lifetime. Yeah, it was that good.

First, special thanks to my friend Mike H. for pointing us in the direction of Joe Beef. I was laser focused on eating at Au pied de cochon during our time in Montreal and prior to him enlightening me, had never heard of ole Joe. We ended up eating at both restaurants and in my (not so) humble opinion, Mr. Beef blows the other place out of the water.

I have to admit that when we walked in to JB, everything about it was uncomfortable. The lights were dim, the music was loud and the small space was so chocked full of tables that you couldn't help but feel everyone was staring at you. This feeling was amplified by the fact that our waitress asked us to study the blackboard menu on the wall while they pulled our table out for us. The two things of note here are that there are no paper menus, so the person with their back to the board needed to decide before they sat, and the tables were so close the staff have to let you in and lock you down... like some sort of culinary roller coaster.

Our food came from nearly every part of the animal kingdom. We had oysters. Great. We had foie gras. Fantastic. The wife had schnitzel. Good. I had a horse steak (yeah, horse... or is it naaay, horse?). Very Good. Everything was expertly prepared and presented in a \"Hey, we like food but we aren't all prissy about it\" sorta way. I don't like prissy. I liked this. The drinks were just as expertly prepared and equally as delicious. Putting a raw oyster on top of my Bloody Caesar? Uhhh, brilliant. (see pic)

Truth be told, the food was not the highlight of the meal. Our waitress, Vanya, may very well be the best server we've ever had. Not only was she knowledgeable, efficient, witty, professional and everything else you look for in wait staff, she was quite simply... lovely. There was something about her warm and friendly way of interacting with you that made you feel like you were the Greatest Person to Have Ever Walked the Planet. I know what you're thinking, Chris is just a sucker for blondes and his enthrallment with Vanya was probably because he'd love any blonde that feeds him. That's not an entirely invalid perception, however my wife had pretty much the same opinion of Vanya... and she's not in to chicks... or so she says. Hmm, give me a minute. Where was I? Oh yes, Vanya. We loved her.

Perhaps the most surprising thing about the restaurant, besides the buffalo in the bathroom, was just how homey it became by the end of the night. I can see how people wouldn't like the close quarters, but have a few cocktails and suddenly the tables around you are welcomed dinner companions. For what it's worth, I went from telling my wife \"I don't want to eat dinner with them\" to high-fiving one of the two guys eating next to us by the time we left. We didn't have to pop our collars. We already knew we were cool.

I firmly believe Joe Beef is going places. They don't have a ton of reviews, but with some of the press they've been getting lately, I expect that number to explode. If others' experiences are anything like ours, they will be firmly rooted at 4.5 stars well into the triple digits. They deserve it."}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. We had the 2nd serving reservation 9:30pm, and after our waitress pitched and presented so well the \"prochetta\" we decided to choose it, however after a few minutes she can back to our table saying that the kitchen had no more left. So I decided for the lamb, it was not bad. My husband had the lobster spagatti and he found it really good. Ambience was nice. Service was not the best as it was slow."}
{"text":"What an experience! This was my first time in Montreal and my friend recommended Joe Beef. We luckily were able to score a reservation on the same day! When we got there for a 9:30 seating, the place was PACKED. Like completely packed. That's how we knew were in for a treat. The staff was exceptional. Incredibly accommodating & sweet. Our waiter was insanely knowledgeable! Since the menu changes all the time, there is no printed menu. He told us of all their specialties, detailed descriptions of 4 different wines in the category we were interested in, and all with a smile & a sense of humor. By far the most delicious thing that we ate was the foie gras & duck egg appetizer. It completely blew me away! Even the homemade bread that they served on the side was delicious! We also got the horse tartare appetizer which was also very good. So different- when do you have the opportunity to try horse?! For our entrees we tried the chicken with mussles and the lobster spaghetti. Both were very good but we're not as good as that foie gras. They set the bar high with that one. Needless to say, we did not have any room for dessert. Next time! Overall fantastic experience. One of my favorite things is that you can have extraordinary food without having to get dressed up & act all bougie! It's a very low key kind of place with moody atmosphere. Love it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"this place was great as expected, crazy menu, i had a giant pork chop, a bunch of wine and cocktails....live it up."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal, I was excited to get a seat without a reservation.

I ordered the foie gras double down. Rich, decadent and something I looked forward to since it was banned in California. Something I look forward when I leave the state. 

I paired it with the Joe Beef house brewed bottle of beer.  

A must visit when in Montreal! This is Chef David Chang's favorite restaurant in the world."}
{"text":"Where to start, three of us went here for dinner in the cold, cold winter of Montreal 2015. Upon entering, I could tell this was going to be special. dark, quaint, intimate, immediate attention at the door, table not ready but escorted to a tiny bar to wait, We were immediately met by the most wonderful server, instantly brought us three bottles of wine to choose from and the way she described them, you could just feel the passion and love for wine coming from her. I have never seen anyone so excited about wanting to help us pick the right wine. We were escorted to our table at this point and immediately created by Alexander. Hands down, the best server I have ever experienced at any restaurant in the world. She was genuinely interested in us, that were were here for the first time and basically told us, \"I am going to take care of you, I have something very special lined up\". She recommended a \"sampling\" of their menu and for the next three hours we proceeded to try 4 different mini entrees, 2 full entrees, dessert, another bottle of wine, and a desert liquor. We had the crouqettes (some sort of meat/cheese), foie gras, a wonderful salmon/cod/caviar dish on icerberg lettuce (made in the their smoker out back), and a bread/cheese/ham dish that literally was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. For dinner, lobster spaghetti and a horse filet (yes, they have horse filets in Canada). Absolutely wonderful and during all of this Alexe would sit with us, describe what we were eating, share a sip of wine, come back, sit some more. Our original server who picked our first wine would also stop by, just really interested in how we were doing. Dessert was equally special, a 50 layer cake that takes 5 hours to make, some sort of ice cream dish, at this point the wine and the dessert liquor had taken their toll, details got hazy :). 

This wonderful evening ended with hugs for Alexe, a promise to return, recommendations for brunch, just all in all a wonderful experience, with wonderful food and the kindest most genuine people I have ever encountered in a restaurant (or anywhere for that matter)."}
{"text":"Our first time here in Montreal and this place was amazing ! We had made reservations in advance because my mother had seen this place on tv. They did not disappoint. Our waiter and staff were attentive, excellent, and friendly. He went over the entire menu ! We ended up with the terrine for appetizer, my mom had the lobster spaghetti, my dad had the half duck and my husband and I had the beef for 2! It was very impressive that they bring out a tray of meat and we chose which to have cooked !everything tasted delicious and cooked perfectly we are still talking about how delicious everything was ! Thank you Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"Leo and Kelly, the service staff, were fantastic! Leo knew exactly what to recommend as you can see per the pics. We are from Cali and the food reminded me of Santa Maria style steaks. The food is BBQed outside and the food is super fresh. This is a must see if you are coming to town. On a side note, two people in line had made reservations a year in advance and three months in advance..... we  snuck in NO RESERVATIONS (no Anthony Bourdain pun intended) lol"}
{"text":"So overrated, so many other good choices in the area, do not trust the hype. You should definitely check out your friendly neighborhood butcher shop and get way more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Overrated unoriginal and mediocre service. Was there for a party dinner for 6 people.

Strike 1: No menus- the waitress forces you to order from a dimly lit chalkboard-menu and since you can't read it you'll end up going with her over-priced recommendations.

Strike 2: The kitchen brought the food out with no rhyme or reason. We had our entrees before our appetizers. 

Strike 3: The service throughout the experience was horrendous with no apologies and shameless price gouged food and wine offerings.  
Avoid this place, instead, go to Au Pied De Cochon."}
{"text":"Come on dude, do I really have to?  This place is balls out good. Like if your mom pulled them out and started twiddling them in front of strangers and not giving a fuck good.

Last minute in, thanks to Le Vin Papillion, and sat at the bar. Dude behind the bar was like the nicest waiter(next to Le Vin Papillion) and was super helpful.

We had: Les Parfait de Foie Gras for the apps, I had a few Frenet and coke cocktails and the Lobster Spaghetti with a side of garden greens with anchiove paste...

Let's just say I passed the fuck out from all that food I ate it was so damn good."}
{"text":"On the second night of our Montreal trip, my wonderful boyfriend and I went to Joe Beef for dinner. Right away, we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. They seated us at our reserved time. There were no menus given to us. The entire menu was written on a big blackboard on one of the walls in the restaurant. To start, we ordered the half sour and crab dip ($13). This dish was cold and flavourless and on top of that, we were not given any bread. We ordered bread, which was $2.50 by the way, and were only given two slices, some butter that we didn't use and half a pickle that we didn't eat.

Although our appetizer wasn't too appetizing, I would have to say that our main course was outstanding. I had the Spaghetti Lobster ($49). This dish was superb. There was a lot of meat to the lobster and the pasta was perfectly al dente. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Joe Beef Monsieur ($49). He was ecstatic with how savoury his steak was. We would definitely come here again for dinner. First Class, A-1.

Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite, you're in for a culinary treat! Joe Beef is about as good as it gets in North America. Montreal, known for their class and amazing food, Joe Beef fits right in and raises the bar.

Delicious raw oysters, foie gras parfait entree, beef shank, horse meat tartar, beef bone marrow, lobster spaghetti. How about the half chicken? It's cutting edge, it's crafted to perfection, it's heavenly. DO yourself a favor and get to Montreal for a stop at Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"We dined here on a Wednesday night. Called in the afternoon around 3 pm and were able to get reservations for that same night for 9:45 pm. Super cute ambiance, although the seating arrangements leave you feeling a bit tight and cramped for space. We ordered fresh oysters, the grand aioli plate, the lobster spaghetti, and steak ambassador. Oysters, grand aioli plate and lobster spaghetti was definitely on point. The steak however was over cooked. We ordered a medium rare, and it came out as a medium. A lot of the reviews state that this was their best dining experience or the food was just so amazing.. it was good, however not amazing for us. Additionally, we felt the service was mediocre. The restaurant does not have a printed menu. Their menu is on a chalkboard by the bar which can be pretty hard to see given the dim lighting, and also dependent upon where you are seated. The host that seated us indicated that our server would go over the entire menu with us - well that did not happen. We felt as if our server was impatient and did not want to read off the menu to us. The table right next to us, however, was doing a tasting menu with paired wines and the server gave them the utmost attention. I definitely feel service needs to be 100% on point especially given their price points."}
{"text":"God damn Joe Beef, errybody wants a piece of you! Make sure to book a reservation before coming - this places get packed!

I love the dimlit intimate setting, yet it's crowded and noisy just like any bar. And the wait staff? Whoaaa, can you say great service?! They're so hip and enthusiastic - makes you want to order everything! Haha.

The food? ORDER EVERYTHING. It has one of the most unique menus I've seen. Do order the foie gras double down and horse steak. The foie gras double down blew me out of my mind. Yummy smooth foie gras on the inside and then covered with fried foie gras on the outside? HELLOOOOO WORLD! And the horse steak? Damn, I was contemplating on whether or not to eat it but I'm glad that I tried it. It was juicy and flavorful, yet so lean. It was like BAM BAM flavor explosion in my mouth!

I had been waiting to come to Joe Beef for about a year and I'm so glad I finally got to experience it this past November. Joe Beef, you didn't let me down. Thank you for your amazingness!"}
{"text":"Our Montreal trip was not complete without trying this highly talked about restaurant. We were glad that we did dined and experienced their amazing cuisine.
Service.Food.Wine.....Excellent. Worth trying if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff was really friendly and helpful, the only thing is that it's very hard to know what you want if you only speak English due to the fact the whole menu is only offered in French. When you get there and are asked what you would like to order if you don't read French the waitress will ready anything you want or looks interesting off the menu. There is no option in the matter they don't offer anything in English. I love the restaurants food but be prepared to do your research before you get there if you don't speak French."}
{"text":"One of the better all around dinner that I've ever had. Service, food, ambience - this place had it all. 

Don't speak French? No problem here. 

Came with wife and we split everything. 

- bison tartare - classic preparation with an egg on top. liked the gaminess of the bison. 
- broccoli -gigantic stock of broccoli from the garden in the back. some type of sauce and parmesan cheese on top added to it. 
- foie gras double down - ordered a half at $17 because I knew I'd have to eat basically all of it. I wasn't expecting much since I thought it was just a playful immitation. This thing was insane. Best foie dish I've had since the foie biscuit and gravy at Animal which obviously isn't on the menu anymore. 
- lobster spaghetti - i know at $55 per portion its a little steep.....but I think I'd order it again if we went. big portion, insanely rich. they don't skimp on the lobster. 
- only let down was a homemade maple donut which was served cold (on purpose but seemed weird), and drenched in a soupy sauce. Could have skipped this one. 

All of the above  + two bloody ceasars (served with two small shrimp stuffed with caviar and an oyster, holy shit) + a house made beer + two shots of fernet came to $206 after tax. I was actually expecting worse. You could get out of here for much cheaper if you wanted to. 

Such friendly and attentive service. Played great 90's hip hop all night. Great place. 

Destination restaurant."}
{"text":"For anyone who has ever watched David Chang's mind of chef, you'll know that Joe Beef represents the sin of indulgence. Previously known to bolster items such as the double down foie gras, the once notoriously overly decadent gastropub serves these days a much more refined and locally sourced seasonal menu. 

I came here expecting greasy and fried dishes that would require hours on the treadmill to compensate for, but left amazed by the freshness and quality of the produce. Don't get me wrong, this is not a healthy place, but it's definitely a gastropub refined in it's highest form. 

We actually started off the evening with a bit of a hiccup as we were forced to wait over 30 mins past our reservation time. However, the lovely waitress assigned to us more than made up for the poor seating time management. Yes, that means we got free stuff!!! Enough to make even hungry Sally aka my fat girl alter ego excuse the mishap. Free drinks, lemonade, appetizer, dessert... Sally was happy :)

As for what we actually ordered, we started off with a dish of cured wild boar topped with rhubarb and shaved parmesan. Not something I've ever seen on a menu before and I can't think why not, as it was delicious. Tasted kinda like prosciutto but less salty and a bit more gamey. We continued with a full quail breast braised in an escargot fondue sauce. The quail was oh so juicy and when mixed with the earthy velvety fondue it was a match made in heaven!

For mains, we opted for our own combination of surf and turf as we shared the steelhead trout and the sub-marine steak. Best piece of seared fish I have ever tasted in my life! The skin was perfectly crispy yet the meat inside was still a solid medium-rare. My logical guess is that they must have cooked it sous-vide before frying it. The steak, although a cheaper flank cut, was seasoned perfectly and accompanied with the classical sub-marine toppings of cheese, lettuce and tomates. You must be thinking, the heck?! But trust me, the flavours paired perfectly together. So well in fact that we made no use of their home made steak sauce that came along with it. 

Of course any solid wine and dine experience calls for some good vino. No worries, as Joe Beef also delivered on that aspect. Not only do they import their own wine but they also feed off the experience of running the Vin et Papillon wine bar next door. Needless to say, they have some excellent offerings to please any palate. 

This place really is the epitome of the 'chasse et pêche' experience in my books. Not only are they true artists in putting together a menu that highlights Quebec's produce in fish, game and meat, but the tavern like decor and relaxed ambiance really ties everything perfectly together. 

Easily one of the best meals I've had in Montreal. Good thing it's extremely hard to get a decent booking at this place as hungry Sally is just begging for more!"}
{"text":"4.5: I'd rate this just a hair under sister restaurant Liverpool House (which is much easier to get into).  As mentioned in my review of that other restaurant, we had back-to-back meals at both restaurants on a cold and snowy April (!) evening.  Our excellent meal began with a disappointment when I ran my eyes across the expansive chalkboard menu: \"where's the foie\"?  At Liverpool the night before there were several options, but I'd \"saved\" myself to really go wild at J.B., and it seemed I was going to be disappointed.  Thankfully there was an eclair appetizer ($21 - top right of my picture) that was perhaps my \"best bite of Montreal\" - just insanely rich and delicious, and something I'd never dream of not sharing (need at least one other person to share with).  

More appetizers: Our beef tartare was so good the night before that we went with that again here, and again it was fantastic, here served on toast.  The croquettes (which seem to always be available, with the protein changing nightly) were cod on this night, and very enjoyable with the bbq, mustard and tartare sauces (wish I'd tried the rabbit ones at Liverpool House).  There was also a green Pappardelle pasta with ragu ($16: middle left) that was very tasty, but more of a side dish than an app.

As we had done the night before, the focus was on the creative apps, with 2 main courses to share.  The first was the \"Pojarski de boeuf\" ($30: middle right) which was a giant meatball served with more delicious pappardelle.  We also had the \"tranche d'epaule d'agneau Boulangere\" ($35, bottom left) which was an amazing braised lamb shoulder.  We shared these with 2 veg plates: the cauliflower gratin (delicious, but so cheesy as to negate calling it a \"vegetable dish\") and another dish of bitter greens that was left pretty untouched (like Liverpool House, the veg options were hit and miss, with one being great, and one disappointing, at each restaurant).

Our group of 4 was again full, but determined to have dessert.  The multi-layer hazelnut cake and the paris brest chocolate concoction were both stupendous, but the sticky toffee from next door still edged them out.

Joe Beef was superior to Liverpool in the pacing of the meal: apps came one at a time to be fully enjoyed, not all at once (but this may have been due to our arrival at 6pm opening).  But after our first dessert, service deteriorated when there was an achingly long pause until the second dessert, and an even longer one for the bill, both of which ended the experience on an avoidable low note."}
{"text":"Too many superlatives about Joe Beef, but I can't necessarily second them. The ambiance is great, the vibe is noisy and relaxed, the packed restaurant certainly has a charm. Trying to figure out the menu on the black board and follow the detailed explanations of our hostess was a little challenging when you are trying to pick a dish, but definitely part of the fun. 

I absolutely enjoyed the BC oysters and the clams in lobster broth that came with a slice of the delicious garlic bread. The Bloody Caesar is to die for, may be one of the best in Montreal. The escargot de Bourgogne were great, but not exceptional. The salad with endives and pear was ginormous and obviously delicious, vegetarians, you are safe in this meaty heaven. 

Three of us shared hare for main, one loved it, two didn't like it very much. I personally found it over salted, fortunately it came with a side of mashed potato and foie gras that compensated for it. The rest of our party were happy with their mains: the famous spaghetti lobster and cold roast beef. 

I guess the sweet highlight for majority of our crowd was the ice cream with pear, hot chocolate poured generously over it.  The hazelnut cake is classical and masterfully prepared. My dessert was disappointment and I would not write about it. 

What I failed to enjoy was our little check drama. The service in the restaurant is great, friendly and smiling. Our hostess was knowledgeable, her dish descriptions were a little bit pretentious, but we found it charming and really part of the overall experience. Than she brought the one single check we had to kindly ask to split (something normal for Montreal) and we got lectured that we should have preventively provided information at the beginning of the dinner how to divide the bill. We got our billS as requested, but some further comments were not with the understanding that \"the customer is always right\". The result is half a star less for the restaurant and standard tip.

My final rating for Joe Beef is 3.5 stars. Would I come back, definitely yes, there is so much more to explore from the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal. I couldn't pick a standout dish, everything is good."}
{"text":"I had the most epic meal of my life here! Fabulous food, gorgeous wine list and exceptional staff!"}
{"text":"Dear Joe Beef and your take on french classics.......by far one of the best meals I have eaten. Your oyster's are world class. Blood sausage and foie gras, marvelous! Smoke meat croquettes, home run. Pork shoulder steak and ribs.........man it makes me wanna move to Montreal to stalk you down and make you cook for me every single night. Hats off to Joe Beef and your entire staff......merci beaucoup"}
{"text":"DO NOT BE DETERRED BY THE NAME. This place does not only offer Beef. See website for details. 

One of the best restaurants in Montéal. Great wine list, well made drinks and a champion oyster shucker (or so I'm told).

But really it's all about the food. Joe Beef serves up all types of dishes, but the one that you would probably think of when you hear the name is their Rambo sized steak for two, can't say that I've had it but I hear its good. The only other constant on the menu is a pasta dish thats made with a whole lobster. Haven't had that either, and I don't suggest you do. With seasonal dishes constantly updated and their proximity to Marché Atwater there really is no reason to go with the permanent menu items.

When I went there I had an artichoke heart salad that was beautifully dressed with a lemon butter vinaigrette. Actually, my artichoke heart salad came with no artichoke hearts, the wait staff kindly brought me another. My main dish was skate. It was fantastic, braised in a mushroom red wine sauce. My dinning companions had the double thick cut pork chop which was roasted with a nice slight pink interior. Desert was a cream in the vein of english clotted cream with strawberries soaked in balsamic vinegar topped off with mint and a piece of brittle.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the attention to detail - what an awesome dining experience!  One of the best meals EVER.  My wife and I split 3 apps and an entree (way too much food, but it was so good!).  Server was outstanding with recommendations.  Overall an outstanding time."}
{"text":"OMG, quel repas ! Nous sommes arrivé un peut plus tôt que notre réservation et quelle bonne idée, nous avons nous lever pour voir le menu d'un peu plus près (écris sur un tableau noir), le serveur nous à très bien conseillé, nous avons pris en entrée des croquettes d'esturgeons, puis en plat un demi canard fumée, et les spaghettis au homard, avec un à côté de frites. Le tout était extrêmement délicieux, pour accompagner le homard et l'esturgeon le serveur m'a conseillé un très bon vin blanc. Seul regret, nous n'avons pas eu assez de place pour le dessert. Leur portions sont plus que généreuse."}
{"text":"Will go back to montreal just for this!! The authenticity of the food and service can't be beat! I  joe beef!"}
{"text":"Joe Beef was fantastic.  The venison was good and the duck was outstanding.  Both proteins were tender and sauced and spiced extremely well.  The ham and aged cheddar appetizer had saltiness, a little funk and just the right amount of sweetness from the apples.  The steak was very well aged if slightly overcooked.  This is decadent dining at its finest.  

What made it a true five star experience was the friendly and knowledgeable staff.  They picked excellent wines to pair with the food, put together a great cheese plate and allowed us to close the place down as the last guests.  

A can't miss destination if you are in Montreal.  (But plan to eat light the next day.)"}
{"text":"Went to Joe Beef last night with a group of friends and it was pure simple savagery. Spaghetti worth Lobster - mind blowing- Cowboy steak was kind meting- rabbit was amazing.. veal tartar was mouth watering and our selection of wines were awesome... it was $1200 for 6 of us and that is showing zero restraint.. it's a must if you love to indulge in hardcore Québécois cuisine."}
{"text":"Talk about decadence. This place is for those who look for interesting and unexpected combinations that yield to amazing plates of food. Take grilled celeriac truffle cheese for instance. I'm pretty sure I didn't have to chew it even once. Melts in your mouth. Or take hanger steak topped with thinly sliced veal tongue along with a drizzle of \"all meat sauce\" that makes the dish salty enough to go for another bite. Portions are big but at the end of the night no food is left on the plate. It's so damn delicious. Oh and also pet the giant bison head in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Joe beef in Montreal is one of the best restaurants in Montreal.  For the type of service and food we received, we didn't pay nearly as much as I thought it would cost.  This restaurant is one of the best restaurants in Canada, we paid what we would pay at a so so steak house in the states. I was blown away. 

I'm writing this review months after I returned to the states from Canada so I can't recall a lot of things.  If you watch Anthony Bordain's layover the Montreal episode, you will not even have to read this.  

You need to reserve well in advance. I reserved a table a month before arriving in Montreal for a party of 3.  I remember it was a very good time and the food was delicious. The specials change all the time so I can't tell you what they are now."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Sat at the bar since I didn't think of JB until a week away...first seating at the bar, we literally walked in as the staff broke from their nightly menu meeting.  As other reviews have noted, everything is on the board in chalk and in French.  Therefore, you must engage with your friendly and knowledgeable server (remember the menu meeting?).

Since we had our annual ration of foie gras at Au Pied, we went for the fresh and large oysters with freshly grated horseradish - excellent!  Made a mental note to have more for dessert.

Tartlet with quail was our appetizer and it was phenomenal!  Enough to share.

Fish with clams was outstanding and cooked perfectly....the 'skin' is not really the fish skin but rather a thin bread crust that is cooked with the fish to give it the even heating and then the flavoring of the breaded skin is crispy and buttery, which went perfectly with the delicate fish.

HOWEVER!  The spaghetti lobster stole the evening for us!  Rich noodles in a creamy tomato sauce tossed with a WHOLE Lobster, yes the whole dang lobster.  I am a member of the 'clean plate club' but this dish did not get completely clean (except for the lobster meat)."}
{"text":"[Wow, just realized the original review is 6yrs old - definitely time to update]

Oh Joe Beef... how do i love thee... let me count the ways.

I will be going back to Montreal next weekend (for the 4th time in the past 12months)
All four times, the first thing I did was make sure I had a Joe Beef reservation.

To say it's my favorite restaurant in Montreal, is an understatement. It maybe my favorite restaurant, period.

The execution of incredible quality with incredible skills, and amazing service (that borders on white glove), while maintaining a casual air (quite a few patrons in t-shirt and jeans), maybe one of my favorite things about it.

Always the little things.... like finding the last bottle of that Gevrey-Chambertin I love so much... or going out of the way to get the name of that local cheese on the cheese plate that knocked my socks off.... everything.

I've had two bachelor party dinners here (one with some young 20-somethings that I thought would surely be bored). After we walked out, one of the 20-something dudes said \"can I hug you now? that maybe the best meal I ever had!\"

And then on my next trip, I brought a girl, and had a romantic table for two in the middle of the back garden... completely to ourselves. She pretty much said the same exact thing after her meal.  HAHA

So far, I've sat in the front room, at the bar, and in the back garden... I'd say I'm a bigger fan of the latter two.

As per food, if it's your first time, don't miss the Lobster Pasta... once you've had it - try everything else.

[*** New Addition 6/24/17: 
The Pasta with Sea Urchin is the best pasta I've ever had... it should be on the regular menu. Actually blows away the Lobster Pasta, which I didn't think was possible! 
***]"}
{"text":"We were able to get a last minute reservation here the day of for 9ish. We thought we had lucked out. In some ways we did, in some ways we didn't.  It was a great meal but it was crazy expensive. I was under the impression that this place was small but it has expanded to a full rowhouse so capacity was not a problem. Couples shuffled in and out and there were 1 or 2 empty tables near us the entire time. It was kind of cramped as we were crammed in there. We were seated at a 2 top between 2 couples in the back. 

Our server was lovely and gave us great choices. It was so dark in there and the writing on the board is so narrow and squiggly there is no way you can see the board so you are completely at the server's mercy when it comes to food and wine choices. The choices she gave us was excellent tho but the prices were tremendously inflated. We got a CAD $110 bottle of wine which I found out on the internet was really a USD $38 bottle of wine so I guess it was the standard markup. We had a Great froie gras appetizer and I had the blue cheese rabbit while hubby had a steak that came overcooked. The server asked him about it and he said it was ok but she took the liberty of sending it back and giving him a rare one instead. I didn't know this at the time but for the prices we were about to pay, it was par for the course. His new steak took a while to come. So 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses, 1 salad and a fruit dessert set us back  400 CAD.  It was about 14 CAD for a side salad add on and similar for a berries dessert with cream. They did give us a small complimentary tasting of another wine for the steak mishap. 

So...it was good but I'm not sure if it was $400 good. I LOVE French Canadian food and have eaten my way through Quebec City on two occasions not having paid nearly as much in a couple of days than what we did tonight. To make myself feel better, I just looked up the exchange rate so the meal was about 300 USD which sits a lot better in my stomach. Still, Joe Beef is kind of overrated but I'm glad we did it. If we were to come back, I'd definitely only have 1 bottle of wine, and skip the expensive extras like dessert and salad."}
{"text":"Joe Beef came up on all our searches while we were planning our Montreal trip so it was in our must-try list. We didn't have a reservation but walked in around 6 pm and got a seat by the bar. It was tight but we managed.

There was no printed menu, which was slightly annoying to be honest. I get the whole bohemian approach thing but with my questionable eye sight, it was hard to read what was on the chalk board. After a lot of  questions directed at our waiter, we finally got our order in.

First to come was the foie gras double down.  We got the half size to keep things relatively sane. This is one of their staples. It's basically bacon & cheese, topped with chicken skin mayonnaise, sandwiched between deep fried foie gras and drizzled with maple syrup. Maybe \"basically\" was the wrong choice of word. It was as decadent as it sounds but while it was good, it wasn't something I'd order again. In all that richness, I didn't find any umami that resonated in me.

Next up, veal tongue with artichoke and red wine reduction sauce. If you like tongue as I do, this is a good dish to try. A lot places tend to overcook tongue coz... well it's tongue, but not here. The red wine reduction sauce was as good as any I've tried and the artichoke balanced the dish out nicely.  

One of the dishes I had to try was the lobster spaghetti after I heard my friend gush about it during his visit here a few weeks before mine. The creamy, buttery sauce was cooked with the head of the lobster and tarragon. It seemed to hug the perfectly al dente spaghetti and the soft pieces of lobster. We had to use all our will power not to get bread to mop up the remaining sauce once we were done with the spaghetti. There was no shortage of umami in this dish.

Somehow we also ended up with tomato salad. How did that happen? I should thank my wife for insisting we get some veggies. The salad consisted of red and green tomatoes with shaved old goat cheese. It was a welcome change in the program.

While we sat at the bar, I was trying to decide on a shot of whiskey to whet the appetite. I saw a bottle of Wiser and told our waiter that I'd never had it. Canadian whiskey is not something many restaurants in NY carry. Even though I just wanted one shot, he poured 3 - one for himself and insisted that my wife have one too. He did charge us just for 1, so I appreciated his hospitality. 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal but wasn't easy on the wallet and the meal was very heavy - though the heaviness was a recurring theme throughout our trip. But hey, a little extra cholesterol never hurt anyone*


*Not a medically proven statement."}
{"text":"One of the single best meals I've ever had. I know it either had to be amazing or grossly overrated as we made reservations 2.5 months in advance and could only score a table at 10PM on a Thursday evening. Needless to say, I had very high expectations for Joe Beef and JB graciously blew those expectations out of the water. 

The whole menu is in French on a chalkboard on the wall. Luckily, I picked up some French in High School and College and was able to navigate our nosh options well enough. If French wasn't your thang in school then the waiters will give ya a hand with the translation. We also did our homework and mostly knew what we wanted. 

The goods: We ordered some of the house pickles along with some of their housemade sourdough with butter which were a delicious beginning to the meal. Next was the sliced ham with mushrooms. I have to say this was one of the best bites of food I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The ham was so wonderfully soft and fresh. The mushrooms were exploding with flavor and then there was a drizzle of a light cream sauce over top. This dish was absolutely divine. Next came the Lobster Spaghetti. If you think you're too old for spaghetti, get over it and order this right now! GIant chunks of lobster + claws served in a heavy cream sauce with over spaghetti. It was so heavy, but worth every artery clogging bite!

For dessert we ordered a Strawberry dish that was absolutely incredible. The Strawberries are shipped down from a farm just north of Montreal and they were so amazingly tart, tangy, and fresh. It made me feel as if I had never tasted a strawberry before and I was tasting them for the first time. Yes, sounds exaggerated but it was that good! 

Our waiter Patrick was absolutely wonderful! He was great on offering suggestions (we asked him to suggest the appetizer for us). He was hysterical, kind, and super quirky.   

Perfect meal in the heart of Little Burgundy."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite restaurant I've ever been too. Friendly owners and staff, delicious food, comfortable environment. I love how you can come as you are and enjoy the best food around."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that needs an extra star to do it justice.

I came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Both here and next door (Liverpool House) are in a special category - no matter how high your expectations, you can still be impressed with what you get. In our case, we had been planning to go to Joe Beef for two years, and finally go around to it just weeks before leaving town for good.

We started with some drinks: I had a (good) negroni, and my girlfriend had the house Caesar. She said she wasn't blown away by her drink (even though it came with a shrimp and an oyster!), but I mine was quite good (and I'm a total negroni connoisseur aka. snob). If the only negative thing you can say about a drink is \"it didn't blow me away\", then it's no that bad of a drink...

My starter was a no-brainer: foie gras double-down. I had heard of it, but needed to eat it for myself. It's over-the-top, decadent, in-your-face ridiculous, and utterly fantastic. I probably can only do one every few years, but will be back for another them moment my coronary tract has cleared.

For our mains, the birthday girl had the cheval (horse) steak, and I had the rabbit. My rabbit was very good, but the winner was definitely the horse. It was cooked perfectly - as good as any steak I've had - and was a really generous portion. There was more than enough for my girlfriend (for her main) and for me to have a big slice too - something that almost never happens when the quality is as good as it was.

I don't recall what we had for dessert - I think the double-down was crossing the blood-brain barrier by this point, but there was really nothing to fault about our experience at Joe Beef, even though it was probably the highest expectations I've had for any meal in my life."}
{"text":"We got off to a slow start, but wow what a meal. I came here on a recommendation of friend who heard from Anthony Bourdain about this place. Its hard to get a ressie, but the JoeBeef gods aligned themselves and we got a table. 

The menu is all written on a chalkboard. That's it. Don't forget your glasses at home. But if you do, the waiters are all so knowledgeable. But the portions are HUGE. no really, they are HUGE. 

Two of us, ordered a half portion of the lobster spaghetti as an app since we wanted to do the lamb for two. Just to let you know, the half portion comes with 1.5lbs of lobster. After just splitting the half portion, hubby and I were so full. But we thought okay, just some protein is coming. How big could it be, since we're thinking of NYC or LA portions. UMMMM The lamb for tow is really for like 4-6 ppl or two men, who've smoke a big ol fat doobie and want to EAT! 

The lamb comes with couscous, potatoes, and a harissa/yogurt sauce. We barely made a dent in it and felt so sad because we coudln't take it home as we were visiting. Suffice to say, two homeless folks had a great meal that night. 

The sister restaurtants, which are literally next door to each other are all quaint and offer the infamous lobster spaghetti as well. 

Everything was fabulous, but that Lobster Spaghetti is worth the hype. Like, I can't wait to go back to Montreal just for the spaghetti. (and Boustan)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was so neat! It is so unique. The walls are covered with cool artifacts and artwork. There is fun rap music playing (for instance: The Game and 50 Cent \"Hate it or Love it\"). Our waitress was great and walked us through the French menu. We had horse tar tar which was amazing although slightly weird for me as an American to eat. I had some veal and bone marrow. That was great as well. This is a must when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I had lived in Montreal for over six years, I'm a regular viewer of all things Anthony Bourdain, and I still hadn't eaten at Joe Beef. I guess I just thought that it would be too difficult to get a reservation, so I just gave up.

Then I heard about this app called DINR where you could get last minute reservations for some of the best restaurants in town. A few days later, I secured a reservation at the bar on a Wednesday night. The service was impeccable, from start to finish. 

I had oysters, scallop ceviche, a soup with bone marrow and sweetbreads. The meal was interesting, dynamic and delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Make reservations!

Try the foie gras. It taste great with with the over easy egg. Nice and salty, and you can taste lots of flavors in your mouth. And the chicken and mussels was very filling. 

A couple of glasses of wine makes this visit a great one. Sitting at the bar was fun. I got to meet a lot of random people and the bartenders were great.

I'm glad I got to experience Joe Beef. There's just so many stuff on the menu and I'll be back to try some other stuff too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very nice staff & warm welcoming for a start. The food is good and consistent; we were 3 guests had different appetizers and entrees - everything was well made - special mention to their oysters selections that is outstanding. Careful not to order too much because portions are very generous.. Especially the meat dishes that are a little fat (but real tasty). Some would say a little expensive for Montreal but  a great deal to New York standards especially with the actual rate change. Joe Beef is definitively worth the detour !!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going to Joe Beef after reading many positive reviews online. Upon arriving, I was warmly greeted and was seated at the bar as I was dining by myself. The ambience was comfortable but a bit loud with table talk.  The bartender, Jan (male), was extremely hospitable. Being a non-French speaker, he was kind enough to tell me the menu options in English as the menu was on a large chalk board in French. I ordered the asparagus salad and the marinated flank steak with crispy Gruyere cheese and sauerkraut.  

The meal started with my drink, a gin and tonic, which was perfectly mixed for me as I do not prefer my drinks to be heavy on the alcohol. After some chatting with Jan, fresh bread and butter, was brought out. Then came the asparagus salad consisting of three different kinds of asparagus, shredded endive, julienned apples, arugula, chives, pine nuts, and almonds all tossed in a light creamy vinaigrette. The complexity of flavors and textures was extremely well-balanced amongst the sweetness of the asparagus, the bitterness of the endive and the sweettartness of the apples. The nuttiness of the pine nuts and almonds rounded out the salad. The salad was large enough that two people could share comfortably.

The marinated flank steak arrived about 40 minutes later. The presentation was beautiful and the aroma immediately took hold. The steak was sitting on a bed of saute' sauerkraut . A thick slice of bacon, it seemed steamed, was atop the steak. A caramel-golden rectangle of deep-fried gruyere cheese nestled against the meat. I sampled the sauerkraut first taking in the rich in the juices from the steak. Amazing! I cut into the flank steak and due to the low level lighting, couldn't tell if the steak was cooked medium-rare as I had ordered. A couple of bites into it, it was a little dry and more medium-well. The steak was extremely salty perhaps from sitting in the marinade a little too long. A little disappointed, I cut into the fried Gruyere cheese with some difficulty to find an empty shell devoid of cheese. Apparently, the cheese was left in the fryer a little too long.

On the event that I come back to Montreal for a visit, I would be hard pressed to say that Joe Beef would be my first choice of restaurants to visit. The service was incredible and the asparagus salad was AMAZING! But for the high price, being given a meal that was over-marinated, over-cooked, and over-fried was a little bit of a turn off. There are a plethora of excellent restaurants to try outside of Joe Beef."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my bf's friend from work. We're from the states and knew that it was very hard to get a reservation. You will be called beforehand and asked to confirm it to keep it. I snagged a spot for two on a Wednesday night about two weeks prior. It's a small and intimate restaurant so you can't expect to walk in and be seated. The staff was super awesome and our waitress explained all of main menu items to us in English (she began in French but quickly realized we spoke English). Kudos to everyone who was serving us. Great wine, fabulous cocktails. But really, the food...AMAZING. I went all out and ordered Horse. You read that right, horse. I took some heat from my family and friends about this decision. But when in Canada...why not? It was amazing. So tender and flavorful! I am so glad I tried it. My bf had the lobster spaghetti for an entree. Lots of meat and really amazing. We split the oyster appetizer beforehand. OMG so many different flavors! I recommend if you're going all out. I need to also point out the bathrooms...there is a giant buffalo in it. Kudos to the decorators for including this in the restaurant! Drinks were amazing and this is a perfect night out if you don't mind spending the money on something fabulous."}
{"text":"Joe Beef had an off night during our last visit. Slightly more than three stars but not the five that we've experienced on previous visits. While the private import wine was lovely, everything save for the reliable spaghetti au homard was either dramatically bland or over-seasoned that night. From the horse tartare (bland) to the  hare (which was so salted that my friend could not finish it), this wasn't the typical Joe Beef experience. Nevertheless, wonderful service and a great atmosphere. I just hope this is an aberration rather than a trend."}
{"text":"When I got to the restaurant I asked for a menu and  the waiter just pointed out the menu on board which was pretty hard to read. And the waiter didn't really help much. So we just ordered what my friend have recommended. We got steak and lobster spaghetti which was very good. It is pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Best meal I had during my entire trip to Montreal.  Amazing food and in a completely unpretentious atmosphere that's cool, comfortable and casual.  It's a unique space with friendly people and while it's expensive it's not overpriced at all.  Well worth every cent we paid.  Suzanne was our server and she was awesome.  Everything she suggested was spot on.  Plus she was just so friendly we actually joked that it would be nice to ask her to join us for dinner.  Weird, right?  But weird in the best way possible.  Definitely check out Joe Beef!  You'll be glad you did.

PS, don't be intimidated when they tell you the strip steak is a large portion.  It is like a meat brick!  But days later I'm still having dreams about how damn good it was."}
{"text":"I cannot handle how great this place is. Sure, the wait is about an half hour long even when you have a reservation and the entire menu of what looks like 50+ different options is only written on one single chalkboard that sprawls across one wall of the restaurant, the place is still so fantastic. 

SERVICE
+ Our server was the most darling and helpful waitress I have ever encountered. She started us off by spending literally 20 minutes translating and describing every single item on the menu for us in such a passionate and compelling way that we needed another 20 minutes to decide what the hell we should order from all the mouth-watering options. Throughout the night, she wasn't hyper attentive to our table, but she made it up by being so sweet and friendly. Oh, and she also came out with two desserts even though we only ordered one, because she knew we had made a conflicted choice and really wanted us to try both. Oh, and since we were the last ones in the restaurants on a Friday night, she poured us some shots before we left. BEST SERVER EVER. 

FOOD
+ Overwhelming
+ Incredibly delicious
+ Everything we ate was delicious and somewhat heftily portioned, so my advice to you is this: Go with your gut. You won't go wrong. 
+ If you'd like a more specific recommendation: get the duck. So so so good. 

AMBIENCE
+ Love the soft lighting and the romantic feel of the strung christmas lights
+ Filled with young, hip montrealers, out-of-towners, and any people who like to eat good grub
+ The kind of place I would love to eat at every night of the week in New York. It has just the right feel of fun, casual, and hip without any of the pretension and wear-and-tear of overhyping. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go there for a long time and sharing that heartwarming moment with a special someone but ... like my prom night ... I end up going with whoever was available. I was saving myself for too long, THAT was the moment (Still talking about Joe Beef)

My coworkers made a reservation for 9.30 pm and the place was very packed. We wait about 15 minutes before our table was ready and they suggest we go grab a drink while waiting. I got a non-alcoholic lemonade, was good ... lemonade is always good.

For appetizers, we shared the Croquettes d'esturgeons fumé (16$) and the beef tartare (12$). The beef tartare was, so far, the best one i've eat in my life. I actually regret not ordering a huge bucket of it ... but I am a lady, I don't eat in buckets anymore.

For the main course, I ordered the infamous Joe Beef's Spaghetti-Lobster (55$). How good it is? ... Just to give you an idea ... MyFitness Pal app slap me in the face and quit me. They took A HUGE lobster, cream, butter, pastas, BACON, fairy dust, god's tears and created the most epic Frankenstein meal monster of all time. 

It's probably a good thing that I wasn't with a special someone because I destroy that thing in less time I am proud of. Did I took a dessert? ... no ... I had to drive myself back home and I was already drunk on food. 

Low point : The menu is hard to read but you don't need one ... just take the Spaghetti-Lobster. 

You are vegan? Don't go. 
Counting calories. Don't go.
You are dangerous with a knife. Don't go anywhere.

You want to spent your money in exquisite food ... You must go!"}
{"text":"OK, so by now everyone must know about the Double Down... If you just want to try it and not have a heart attack, take the small one and share. 
I am not someone who eats a lot of meat so i started off with 2 salads. They are gigantic, so take just one! (They are also smothered in cheese LOL!!!!  Very good!)
Everything is delicious & hearty. The fish, the veal cheeks, the steak. They have the BEST mashed potato. The fries though? Not so much... tiny bits with a bitter aftertaste. 
If you are going to get a gift certificate for someone, make sure to get them in chunks of $100 because no matter the amount, they will have to spend it all on one visit  (I don't know if this is a common practise for restaurants...) As I had a big amount, we ate A LOT. The only time I was ever thankful for $100-wines. 
The desserts are pretty good too if you took the rest of your main in a doggy bag :)"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  They pretty much made for us whatever we wanted.  We had the soup with snails - amazing!  Then a steak for 2 with fois gras on top - wonderful meal and excellent service from Ludevic"}
{"text":"Delicious food, super nice staff. A bit too small so the tables are set close to each other. If there is a group sitting next to you, you have to yell if you wanna speak with friends ."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant. It's quite a treat but you can't really go wrong with this place. Service is extremely friendly, staff is more than helpful and the food is always on point. Dish sizes are more than generous, so don't be shy to start with a few things to share !"}
{"text":"After an anxious six week wait, the night finally came for dinner at Joe Beef! 

Pros:
1. Service is impeccable. All of the staff is very knowledgeable, in-tune with the menu and attentive to allergies. They checked back at just the right frequency. No complaints at all here. 

2. Food is definitely above average. Snow crab legs were incredible -- As our server said, they are in season right now so they were very sweet and didn't even need condiments. The lamb sausage was a tad too salty in my opinion and could have used more starch or veggie on the side to balance that out. The strip steak was flavourful but a little more tough than expected. The fries were cute in a mini Creuset but pretty standard in terms of taste. 

Cons: 
1. Menu is only in French and on the blackboard. Being fully bilingual, I didn't mind at all that the menu was in French. More importantly, I just don't think it is practical to have the only version of the menu on the single blackboard that half the restaurant has their back up against. The ONLY thing that partially made up for it was the detail-oriented servers who could cater to individual questions. It just seemed like a bit of a drag for the server to repeat the menu so many times. 

2. In terms of value, sad to say that Joe Beef didn't live up to the hype this time. I'm all about paying good money for dinner but we both agreed that the meal just didn't live up to the long wait for reservations and the price.

To try next time: 
- Lobster spaghetti 
- Rib steak for 2"}
{"text":"One of the bests meals I've had this year. Thank you to Sarah for helping us put together the perfect meal and can't wait to go back. 

We had the 60 day dry aged steak. Buttery, melt in your mouth. The salad made from their garden was yummy and the cauliflower roasted in pork ah jus was out of this world. We also had the pork cheese fritters which was a special and easily could have ordered two more plates if we weren't already too full.  Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Still fantasizing about the lobster pasta. Such a perfect plate. Love this restaurant and it never disappoints. Service is always on point. Great wine list as well."}
{"text":"Pour les paresseux qui ne veulent pas lire, je vais racourcir ma note en un paragraphe, mais j'ai l'intention de commenté chaque chose, c'est rendu un méga classique de Montréal et une critique en bon éduforme est d'usage. 
Bouffe: 5/5 
Service (pour moi 5/5 mais les autres autours de ma tables ont ressenti un certains stress désagréable en ayant a avoir une bouchée et se faire demandé s'ils avaient fini en mastiquant leur bouché et voyant que c'était pas fini.) Moyen 3.7/5 (Il manquait du pain et à 6 personnes, la rotation du pain compte. 
Prix: 3/5 . C'est clairement là où le bas blesse. C'est clairement un prix qui est misé sur un certain hype trendy à fond qui fait que le rapport portion/prix était un peu faible mais passable. Disons simplement que j'avais mangé un bon repas ce midi et sans cela, j'aurais pas été rassasié malgré le fait que j'aille prit 3 services. 

Ma crainte en allant au Joe Beef c'était que le Hype l'aurait emporté sur la qualité de la nourriture et là-dessus, j'ai été complètement satisfait. Est-ce que je vais retourné au Joe Beef. Non quasi-catégorique. J'ai eut comme optique de me diriger vers un repas le plus santé possible et principalement orienté sur les fruits de mer et poissons. Nous avons tous commencé avec une Huitre chacun Cobville (de l'Ile du Prince Edward) Succulante mais pas donné. 3.50$ chaque. J'ai pris l'anguille en croquette avec 3 sauces, dont une sauce au BBQ et pruneau; Génial. Vraiment un must! Mon ami à prit salade verte et c'était plutôt simple mais honnête. Un autre ami à prit le saucisson de lapin qui était très bien à mon goût. P-e pas 100% lapin mais vraiment pas le goût qui peut être un peu caouchouteux du lapin. Le goût me faisait penser à un saucisson porc et lapin plus que d'autre choses.

J'ai ensuite prit comme repas principal le saumon et crabe servit avec chou fleur. La portion des entrées était très bien mais celle du plat principal un peu mince mais passable. La cuisson de mon saumon était 100% parfaite. Je dois admettre que j'n'ai pas ressenti le goût du crabe qui a été dominé par le saumon. C'était p-e un peu salé mais j'ai vraiment aimé.  P-e un peu trop mais j'ai la dent salée/sucrée. J'ai terminé mon assiette en 4 minutes. J'ai mangé comme un soldat en faisant tout pour me retenir mais c'étais juste trop bon et ça fondait dans la bouche. Mon ami a prit le Cerf à la Tchèque que j'ai goûté. Vraiment génialissime. J'n'ai jamais mangé du Cerf aussi bon (et j'en ait quand même mangé une bonne dizaine de fois). Tendre à souhait et à mon humble avis, le meilleur produit qualité prix sur notre table. En dessert, j'ai pris une Religieuse avec un Earl Grey. C'était succulant. Une religieuse c'est 2 choux à la crème farci un plus petit et un plus gros bien farci d'une chantilly au Kouing. Absolument délicieux. La partie supérieure de mon déssert était plus croustillant et avait des petits cristaux de chocolat blanc ou de fondant, enfin, j'ignore ce que c'était exactement mais c'était sublime. Il n'aurait pas fallu que j'en aille 3 ou 4. C'est le genre de truc que j'mangerais à l'infini. 

Notre repas était accompagné d'un bon Vin rouge corse (70$)

Ok maintenant la section «vent» plus négative:
La bière Joe Beef (fait par la brasserie Biere Brier) a 9$ pour une bière c'était un peu poussé. Je sais que c'était la même chose que la Bierbrier dans une bouteille plus vieille école.  Le fait que mes amis ont été un peu poussé pour compléter leur entrée, qu'il y avait un certain carpharnaum pour la place limitée sur la table. Je dirais que mon second hic c'était qu'on a seulement aprìs à la fin qu'il y avait une toilette de l'autre bord (le resto est fait en U je dirais).  L'autre point négatif: 1 facture pour la table! Pourquoi? Est-ce que c'est juste parce qu'un programme Maitre D c'est trop cher? Je ne comprends pas. C'est justement un traccas, tu veux que tes clients partent pour que d'autres client rentrent et prennent leur places, pas de voir un 10 minutes de gens qui sépare leur facture avec leur calculatrice de Téléphone Cellulaire. J'ai trouvé cette partie mal avenante et de savoir que j'ai p-e trop payé ou pas assez «m'angoissais» un peu. De plus, on rentre, la serveuse nous fait un coat check, j'ai pas vu ou elle est partie avec mon manteau, nous avons finalement payé et puis nous attendons...que se passe-t-il? C'est un semi-coat-check ? Ah lala! C'est vraiment un 4/5 qui a failli être un 3/5 si ce n'était pas de la très bonne table et de la déco et de la coutellerie (surtout l'assiette du déssert).  Pourquoi je bitch autant? parce que si j'avais payé 80$ avec un tip au lieu de 120$ j'aurais pas le même débat ou les mêmes attentes. Le prix augmente, les attentes aussi, c'est ça le risque."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best lobster pasta I have ever had. We also had the horse and the mushroom with cheese appetizer. None of which disappointed. We were so sad for the dinner to be over. I suggest booking early (this place books out months in advance, for right reason) and ask for a quiet table in the back room"}
{"text":"Where to begin...The oysters were the best I've ever had. They had incredible raw clams as well. Everything brought to the table was better and better. Our server Samia was not only beautiful but knew wine and food incredibly well. Everything about the night was perfect."}
{"text":"OMG the food, the service, the atmosphere, the creativity, the love that pour in to each dishes they all get 5 stars from me 

Our reservation was at 8:45 and we were seated right away. There was a line outside till like 10 pm on Thursday night. That's how good the foods are. No joke!

My friend at work told me about this place and he was like \"you HAVE TO go to Joe Beef\" so I try to make s reservation online and dang first available was like October  so I call they hotel concierge and asked for help and they make it happened!! 

Anyway, if you are in Montreal \"YOU MUST GO TO JOE BEEF\""}
{"text":"Yes, it's super popular (with good reason) and can be crowded, but if you get there early, you can get a great table or spot at the bar. Lobster spaghetti was amazing, as were the drinks!"}
{"text":"I have to say I enjoyed everything about my experience at Joe Beef! We had great service as the staff was very friendly,efficient &welcoming and they definitely knew the menu inside out. While the inside was pretty small it was cozy but without feeling like everyone was stuck together. We enjoyed everything that we ordered. We started with the sturgeon croquettes , they were nice and crispy on the outside and very tasty and flavourful on the inside and not oily at all. We then had the lobster pasta and the venison dish. The lobster pasta was nice and creamy made with lobster bisque and a ton of fresh flavourful lobster meat and the venison was cooked and seasoned to perfection with a great sear on the outside and foie gras on top. The meal was delicious and I could eat it again and again ! for dessert we ordered espresso and a slice of layered cake to share , the espresso was bold and well made and the dessert complimented it very well , the cake was fresh and not too overly sweet and really topped off the meal well. While the meals are a little bit pricey it was worth it for the quality of food and service. I would recommend this place to anyone for a nice date night and even if you're just in the mood for some great food! definitely make a reservation in advance as this place books up quick and I can see why !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried to get a reservation a week before we left NYC, but were denied, and were thrilled that we were able to call one in the day of.  (We even got upgraded from the bar to a real table!) Oh the disappointment that ensued.

The good:
-The wait staff is genuinely friendly and knowledgeable.
-The duck spam was the best breakfast sausage I ever ate.  It's accompanying asparagus tasted more like asparagus than any one (of many) I ever cooked.
-They make amazing French fries.  
-Their bread is moist and flavorful. 
-My girlfriend enjoyed her braised lamb main, and it was indeed tender, but I found the flavor was merely average.

The bad:
-The menu is in French, which forced the waiter to read us every item on it.  It created a lot of pressure to choose on the spot.
-The menu is on a chalk board only, so anyone with his or her back to it is out of luck.  Also, it isn't visible from the bar area, so bar patrons are reading it over your shoulder.  Really, you're so high on yourself that you can't print it bilingually and on paper? 
-The much-talked about app of bacon and cheese stuffed between two pieces of fried foie gras is very good, but not worth writing home about.  The bacon was pure limp fat and the foie coating was oil greasy (not foie greasy).
-The lobster sausage main was disappointment on a plate.  The accompanying clams and mussels were good enough, but the squid was rubbery and the sausage was poor.  First, it was dry.  Second, it had no lobster flavor.  Third, when I dissected it, the few pieces of lobster claw meat it contained were bone dry.

If you want good food, by all means eat here.  If you want a revelation, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff if very knowledgeable and friendly, the food is creative and delicious and reservations are very hard to come by.  With that being said this is a must visit restaurant, and go with a good appetite."}
{"text":"Possibly the best meal I've had in 10 years. Maybe ever. There is nothing to compare it to. Completely unpretentious: the service was brilliantly kind and welcoming at every level. Our waitress guided us through the French menu and helped us with wines. And the food defied imagination. It was that good. Oysters, fried zucchini flowers stuffed with smoked eel and cheese, heirloom tomatoes, lobster pasta, and halibut poached in olive oil on fresh beans. Don't hesitate. I would come to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after reading a lot about it and seeing it featured on Anthony Bourdain's \"The Layover\".  It did not disappoint!  The service was good and our waitress was friendly and knowledgable.   The menu looked really good and it was hard to choose what to eat.

We were a group of 3 and decided to split some appetizers to start.  We ordered the horse tartar and the foie gras double down both of which were quite good.  I especially liked the foie gras double down.  Split 3 ways it was fine for the portion size so I recommend splitting it if you intend to try it.

I had the rabbit as my maiin dish which came with a side of spaetzle (German  dumpling)s.  Portion size was a bit too big and I had to leave some of it behind but the taste was excellent.  The rabbit was very moist and full of flavour.

For dessert I tried the Joe Beef sundae which was okay but I don't think I'd get it again.  Honestly if I were to go back I'd probably skip dessert altogether just because  I was already so full from the rest of the meal. 

I really enjoyed my experience here and would jump at the chance to go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal in November 2008, I read a rave review of this restaurant in Fodor's Montreal & Quebec City 2008 guidebook: \"Dining at Joe Beef is a little like being invited to a dinner party by a couple of friends who just happen to be top-notch chefs.\" We were not disappointed!

We made reservations before coming (which is highly recommended since this place fills fast). When we got there, the staff greeted us warmly and explained that the menu was on the chalkboard across the room. Most dishes were in French, so we asked for a translation from our server. She was more than willing to help out, explaining dishes to us with a significant depth of knowledge.

For appetizers: we chose bone marrow (garnished with beef and thinly sliced pickles, served with toasted brioche) and sweetbreads (with a sweet sauce over a bed of rice). Both were fantastic.

For entrees: I ordered the Dover sole and my companion ordered Hot Chicken Joe Beef (a deboned and flattened chicken, cooked in its own juices, served between two pieces of bread). These dishes were unbelievable. They were so good.

We also had dessert, but devoured them so quickly that I was unable to record what they were.

I can't wait to come back. It was fantastic all around, comfortable, friendly, unique, and delicious."}
{"text":"This place has pretty amazing service.  I ventured in one day and it normally takes a long time to get reservations but they seated me after I pleaded my ignorant tourist case.  I got the chevre and double-down foie gras as well as the oysters.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"I had a beef with Joe initially. It was frustrating trying to reserve a table. Many phone calls and no one answered no matter when I called. Then the Robo phone picked up and demanded Pin numbers, passwords and secret codes to get to speak to someone. The NSA would have had a difficult time getting through, and I thought it would have been easier to get a hold of the Pope. Finally, I worked my way to Bookenda which is their online booking service. They time your \"session\" and ask more questions than my internist. I needed a drink by the time they let me reserve a table at a B-list time of 9:45 PM, and it was only 9:00 AM when I hung up. Undaunted, we showed up at 9:37 and were asked to stand in the middle of the restaurant wedged in among other dinners and swirling wait staff which we did while squinting at the menu written in tiny script in French on a blackboard high up a wall. Eventually, we were asked to slide through the passage way to the next room and enjoy a drink before we were seated. The restaurant is a hodgepodge of small carriage houses linked together in a haphazzard fashion. Steps and  narrow pass throughs. We were deposited next to the bar. There was an L with only two seats....our grand luck. We hopped onto the comfortable barstools and shortly Kris, the bar tender/server, introduced himself and immediately realized that a drink was a medical necessity. He whipped up his special Dandelion \"drink your veggies\" which was truly divine and a whiskey sour made as good as the whiskey will allow. He translated the entire menu, made suggestions, took his time, told us about the things that weren't written on the menu and guided us to a half portion of the signature Lobster Spaghetti after we had pate and an Oyster Gratin. Both the pig and shelfish died happy knowing what was to become of them. Perfection on a plate. A platter of Walleye on lentils was sublime. Catch a fish, not too hard. Cook a fish is manageable, but to cook a fish this well is magic. All the while Kris was a non-stop fountain of useful Montreal info, not limited to food and drink but a cultural tour of the city as well. We thoroughly enjoyed the Cote du Beaune he recommended.  He was patient and helpful throughout our amazing dinner after we just let Kris steer. In fact, in all fairness, the entire staff is professional, and genuiniely interested in making sure every patron takes away a perfect night out. We closed the place  and would have happily come back in 7 hours for breakfast if they were open. Kris suggested the donuts stuffed with prune puree and topped with a Quebecoise artisanal cheese and locally sourced maple syrup. A combination that sounded like something from a kid's chemistry set. Wow, was it delicious. Kris finally had to yank the plate out from under my tongue. The entire eveing was a perfect experience, and all the accolades which caused me to try to dine there in the first place were spot on and nothing about the meal disappointed. The only thing I would have done differently is to book a table there for the next four nights. Don't miss this place. I miss that place."}
{"text":"They pack the tables really close together.  While it was nice for making friends with a very nice couple beside our table, it made the restaurant so loud that we could barely talk to each other.

The food was good, but there are better options in Montreal."}
{"text":"More in the blog:

The Why:  Along with Au Pied du Cochon, David McMillan and Frédéric Morin's 75-seat bastion of heavy locally sourced gluttony was at the top of my \"to-dine\" list when making my first visit to Montreal.  Having garnered national attention after a visit from David Chang and subsequently releasing a cookbook appropriately titled \"Art of Living According to Joe Beef\" I knew it would be my kind of place - I just hoped the chalkboard menu could appease the picky palates of my mother and aunt.

The Space:  It's a bar - it is tight, it is cramped, it is full of odds n' ends, nick-nacks, trinkets, and even the bathroom is used for storage space.  Apparently only originally 35 seats and subsequently expanded to 70 the stools/chairs are hard and they seat you where they can - in our case at a \"3-top\" booth in the window.  Really, it's pretty awesome, but when it is full it is Loud with a capital L.

The Service:  Is \"hipster formal\" a service style?  It is now.  Much like the folks at Publican in Chicago or the Chang spots in New York these waiters, decked out in plaid and 5 o'clock shadow know the menu, the preparations, and the chef's vision without hesitation.  Recommendations flow freely, cautionary tales of \"ordering too much\" are given (and ignored,) and although his accent was thick our server's English was flawless - a must on the all-French Chalkboard menu.  

Cornflake Eel Nuggets with BBQ, Mustard, Tartar:  As anticipated, my aunt had a lot of difficulty with the appetizer portion of menu but wanting to make sure we experienced the best of what Joe Beef had to offer I took the liberty of ordering the first round for the table; three items with this as the centerpiece.  Served as a half-dozen, intense and creamy with that unctuous undertone that few things save for eel can offer, this should definitely be a must order for anyone making the visit.  Sweet without being sweetened, fatty without being 'greasy', and particularly excellent with the barbeque sauce - with the ladies unwilling to try I gladly ate all six.

Parfait de Foie Gras, Cherry Brioche, Truffles:  3.5 ounces of creamy duck liver whipped with black truffles served beneath a piping hot piece of buttery brioche loaded with maraschino cherries; it was every bit as good as it sounds and although I had to wait for a second piece of brioche I was glad to do so.  Like most things at Joe Beef this was probably best shared-but it wasn't.

Foie Gras Double Down:  The second half of my main course was probably Joe Beef's most famous item and clearly poking fun at KFC's abomination of a sandwich Joe Beef takes the concept to a whole different level by replacing chicken with two thick slices of duck foie gras that are butermilk brined and breaded prior to a trip to the deep-fryer and wrapping them around aged cheddar and sliced bacon.  Loosely wrapped in aluminum foil and drizzled with pure maple syrup, sriracha, plus a bit of garlic and Old Bay infused mayonnaise the sandwich was much like everything else at Joe Beef, brash and unapologetic but at the same time nuanced and subtly sophisticated.

Lobster Spaghetti:  The recipe goes a little something like this - A 1.25 lb. lobster, 0.25 lb. house made spaghetti, 2 slices diced bacon, 3 Tbsp Brandy, 0.25 cup peas, 0.25 cup 35% cream, 0.25 cup half-and-half cream, salt, pepper, chopped chives.  The pasta is al dente, the lobster is snappy and sweet, and the sauce is the very definition of decadence - at $49 it is the most expensive item on the menu, but apparently also the most ordered...and for good reason.

Pistachio Financier - Maple Ice Cream:  I was told by a friend that while APdC's desserts are 'hit and miss' I should definitely save room for those at Joe Beef. Beginning first with one of the two 'larger' desserts my photos really don't do justice to how big this cake was, but at nearly eight inches in diameter and probably a half inch thick it was great - a thick sponge with great tooth already saturated with butter and almond paste but eager to soak up the creamy maple syrup and ice cream while pistachio granola added more texture.  Always happy to overindulge in desserts this was exactly my 'style' - a standout of the trip.

The Verdict:  The place is loud, audacious, and cramped while the food is equally brazen and uncompromised but with servers that love their job and chefs who know the basics well enough to nail them yet also  know themselves well enough to take chances there is a whole lot to love about Joe Beef.  While some may say it is derivative of APdC I personally couldn't imaging visiting Montreal again without dining at both because although the cuisine shares some similarity each is an entirely unique experience - Picard's space a self-proclaimed \"bastion of excess\" while McMillan and Morin's restaurant puts less emphasis on the audacity of each dish and more on experiencing their \"Art of Living\" inclusive of food, service, and setting."}
{"text":"Loved Joe Beef! It's an unstuffy casual restaurant with delicious carefully prepared French food in abundance and warm helpful service. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."}
{"text":"This is an understated restaurant where it is literally all about appreciation of food, ingredients and gluttony. Joe Beef isn't anything fancy and the decor is nothing to write home about, there is no pretentious vibe to be found here, and the FOOD is the heart and soul of this restaurant. 

I would recommend the lobster spaghetti. The waiters know what they are talking about and made fantastic recommendations!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a group of four at 7pm which apparently was first seating.  We arrived 15 minutes early and were the first guests there.  I thought the chalkboard menu was quite charming but I can see how it could be annoying to some.  I noticed many diners standing behind a table full of guests, just to look at the menu.  I'm sure I'd find that annoying if I were sitting there.  We had no problem since we were seated perpendicular to the menu/wall.  The menu itself is written in French, but the waiter was nice enough to give us a run down of ever item on the menu.  We would've been lost without it and worse, we would've stuck with the simple stuff we could understand and missed the gems like the horse filet and veal chop.  

The food was spectacular!  The veal chop was juicy and charred just enough.  The mashed potatoes, presented in a small All-Clad pot, were some of the best I've ever had.  I tried a friend's horse filet and it was surprisingly tasty.  There were no complaints from the other two in my crew with the lobster spaghetti.  I don't eat seafood, so I wouldn't know anything about it.

All in all it was one of the greatest meals I've ever had and wished there was a Joe Beef in NYC.  

Oh yea.... there's a surprise waiting for you in the bathroom!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying a block away from Joe Beef and had heard all the hype.  We were thrilled to get a coveted reservation on a weekend night.  The server steered us toward ordering family style, encouraging us to order a steak, lobster spaghetti and fish dish.  She said if we order three appetizers as well we should be set.  Three??  We were under the belief that family style meant larger portions of the dishes to share between the four of us.  It does not.  The lobster spaghetti is everything it's hyped up to be.  Wonderful,  in a decadent sauce, however we  only got a  few bites each.  The steak was a $90 tough, flavorless, grey hockey puck.  We ordered medium and it came out well-done. It was so disappointing!!!  For a $90 steak, you'd hope it would be one of the best you've ever eaten.  I think if I microwaved a cheap steak at home it would replicate how tasteless and tough it was.  Unfortunately, we're not complainers and ate our few bites of each dish.  I told the server when she asked that the lobster spaghetti was divine, the trout good, but the steak was so disappointing.  She acted surprised and didn't offer to make things better.  Another thing that can be improved is making the menu written on the wall (that's the only menu) larger.  Its very difficult to see, esp. in a dim setting."}
{"text":"i love this place! I've been here 5 times and every time its a wonderful experience. The people who work there are extremely nice and polite and the atmosphere and decor is one of a kind. Every time I've been we always get the same mains to share, the lobster spaghetti and the joe beef steak, its more than enough food for 2 and both taste amazing! The joe beef cesar is the best one I've ever tasted, its garnished with a raw oyster and a delicious cold lobster claw. I have nothing negative to really say except the tables are very close together so you can really hear all the conversations around you and also its a bit expensive. But, you got to pay the cost to eat like a boss! Oh and i bought the Joe beef cookbook, interesting history on the restaurant and yummy recipes! it was a nice read."}
{"text":"A pure 5 star rating without a doubt in my mind. We came to Montreal to specifically go to Joe Beef and it was certainly worth it! Rated one of the most difficult places to get a reservation, we booked many moons ahead of time. Upon arrival, we noticed all the menu items were written on a chalk board. Having poor vision, combined with dimmed lighting, I opted to go with the chefs choice for 6 courses.  It relieved us of the stress of deciding what we should share while adding a layer of anticipation and surprise.  Out waiter was terrific as he attended multiple tables with his cat shirt in celebration of National Cat Day.

Favorite dishes: bone marrow, calamari stuffed with meat in a red wine mushroom sauce and apple donuts with smoked Gouda.

While everything was perfectly cooked, a bit too salty on some of the more savory items.  Just a general preference of mine, but it didn't stop me from eating everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, we shared the Ribeye for 2. It was way too hot inside for me, when you pay $50 for a steak I would like to enjoy it with some a/c, not a fan blowing. 
Amazing vegetable garden in the back patio."}
{"text":"I was stoked to be eating at one of the \"best\" restaurants Montreal has to offer. It was also at one point mentioned by Jimmy Kimmel on TV and Anthony Bourdain. I was truly excited. Make no mistake. Unfortunately...it was an utter disappointment for me. We ordered drinks and started with an appetizer that sounded the best. Mozarella appetizer with corn...on a bed of squash...insert whatever crap fancy description that got me to buy this at $20...

It was simply a cut of bread...deep fried...with corn and squash on top. I'm not underestimating this...it was downright flavorless. The Mozarella was nice but nothing mind blowing. Flavors painfully missing. Insult to injury? It was barely shareable...like 1 piece of bread I can get at my local market.

Despite this I ordered their signature dish. Lobster spaghetti! OH YOU JUST HAVE TO GET THISS GUYSSS! YOU JUST HAVE TO GETTTT THISSS! No...I'm kidding. Run the hell away from it. Getting this is what people keep advocating. Blowing it up to living hell in terms of flavor expectations. So what did I do? I trusted them and ordered this. It was literally flavorless. Nothing about the actual spaghetti tasted of lobster. Rather like shoving spaghetti and bland flavorless heavy cream in my mouth. Lobster itself had flavor of course...but not the dish as a whole. The server asked how it was and I was at a loss for words. I said I want to be honest. IT'S BLAND! And this even after I asked for salt to bring flavor to this dead seaport dish...no cross that...a dead fish would probably have more flavor than this dish. I am not exaggerating.

She claimed it was the first time she ever heard this to her surprise. I was personally just as surprised. I kept asking what it's actually SUPPOSED to taste like. And she mentioned ...spaghetti...light lobster flavor. I said uhm ok...well....it's horribly bland. Could they have messed up?? She said impossible since it's the same recipe they've been making for years. I was so confident this dish was bland and tasteless I was OK with her or even the chef giving it a taste. But she didn't do that and instead offered a replacement dish...seeing as how I was actually STRUGGLING to finish this horribly overpriced and tasteless dish..

I declined. I simply was full from the crappy pasta I had to endure. I still paid for my lobster spaghetti...but they should have taken it off the bill without me having to ask...in fact I let my server know that I really wanted to like the dish...but utter disappointment to which she said \"I did offer a replacement dish, you could have said yes.\" True...but if I decline another crappy overpriced dish...just remove it from the bill. Oh well. My charity of the week. One thing is absolutely clear to me: Joe Beef is nothing but shitty, overpriced hype. Don't let the exclusivity of the reservations make you feel like you're missing out or believe the \"best dining experience in mahhh LIFE!\" reviews. Those people clearly haven't dined at some ACTUALLY amazing places.

Avoid...AVOID...AVOID"}
{"text":"No words will do justice to the food here.

I've been meaning to come to Joe Beef for a while now, I mean I'm a native Montrealer and just never got the chance while droves of tourists, Anthony Bourdain followers and every chef on earth has been coming here for years.

So with last minutes changes, somehow  I finally came last week for a 6pm seating.
My dinner companion friend and I were not disappointed. I've seen the photos, I know the call, I knew even before I sat down what I was going to have. 
For lovers of seafood, the East Coast oysters here are a \"must\". Briny, juicy and plump and shelled right upon ordering, a quirt of lemon juice is all you need to happily slurp these beauties down.

Which then brings me to the Bloody Ceasar. Served in a Mason jar, a stalk of celery, a pickle and an olive dunked within along with a giant shrimp and a single oyster in the half-shell sitting across the mouth of the jar, with spiced chilli salt rimmed around the glass, *THIS* should be the new normal of how all Bloody Caesars should be served the world over, in my humble opinion.

I knew I wanted dessert so I knew I couldn't go overboard on everything so to pace myself, I deliberately got a light starter, in this case the watercress soup. If you like things which taste green-ey then you'll love this soup. If on the other hand, green smoothies are not your thing, don't get this. The garlic bread slices which it came with were perfect. 

I got the spaghetti lobster, a whole flippin lobster, claws, tails and legs, cooked, cracked open, sauteed in some God-knows-what-rich-fatty buttery with parsley concoction along with spaghetti. I was brought up to clean my plate off  and while I was inching closer and closer to the explosion mark, I figured to be good, at least I could polish off the lobster meat, which I did. It turns out I should not have felt so bad. They do doggie bags here, so that rich spaghetti I left on my plate, I was able to take home with me to nosh on the next day.

My friend had I think a Cornish game hen, deep breaded with panko, sitting in another ungodly rich sauce. He finished of his bird and had to take the sauce home. I tried a bite and it was also delicious. We also spied over at the table next to us. The couple had ordered probably the most amazing cuts of steak I've seen in a long while, large enough to probably feed a village in Bangladesh . They too were relieved to learn they could take it home as well.

For dessert I had the infamous Gateau Marjolaine. Good thing it was a thin slice because this was one of the richest cakes I've had in a while. Because it was my birthday, I got a sparkly candle too! Service was outstanding. Our waitress explained all the dishes to  us and the wine lists as well. After every course, our tables were wiped down, and I even saw Fred and Dave lurking in the back .

This is a bucket list restaurant. If you live in Montreal, you have to come here at some point. No excuses."}
{"text":"This is apparently a highly rated restaurant, even though it looks like a hole in a wall from the entrance. Maybe this is common in Montreal? I'm writing this review months after I went there so I don't remember much of the food I ordered. What sticks out was their horse meat dish, it was great. The meat was very tender and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Worth all the hype. There were 2 of us and had oysters, 2 apps, and 2 entrees...we could not finish! Portions are huge! 

Oysters....briny and beautiful. Delicious as is...mignonette was the best or plain.

Endive salad with blue cheese and hazelnuts...yummy, bitter, delicious.

Pasta with Ragu....blood noodles with ragu as suggested by server. AMAZING. Listen to your servers. They are wise.

Montreal steak....hanger steak with smoked meat and frites. How can you go wrong? Salty tempered with sour pickles. Yellow mustard for kick. 

Lobster sausage with clams and mussels...,sauce was incredible, sausage was so rich I could only handle a few bites. However I've been thinking about it all day.

Go. Go now. We did a same day reservation with DINR app..."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant, but not exceptional... Except for the fries: the person who invented that dish should win a Nobel prize: Potatoes fried in beef fat, tossed in butter and garlic, sprinkled with parmesan... Very addictive. 

The whole smoked trout was the highlight of the night. It was just perfect. If you ask, they will show you where they keep the live trouts and where they smoke them. The trout is served with crepes, butter and pickled veggies. 

Appetizers were just ok. The chef must like pickles because they are present in many dishes. 

Lobster pasta was not great... All you taste is the brown butter. I was very excited to try this dish and was quite disappointed. 

The ham is made by a friend of the owners. This was the only dish that I would say was truly terrible. Basically just a slice of fat with no taste at all. Very underwhelming especially for someone like me who really enjoys good quality charcuterie.

The staff is so friendly. They are all very knowledgeable of the menu and truly make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I get it. Maybe part of why people love this spot is because it isn't an easy place for non-French speaking tourists. So as a non-French speaking tourist, I was willing to look past the menu that is only in French and only written on the wall not visible from the table.  But really the food was just okay.  The lobster spaghetti and foie gras brioche was pretty decent. But, the oysters were buffet quality and the New York steak was so tough it was nearly inedible.  I don't get the yelp hoopla.  The staff was nice which pushed the rating up from 2 stars."}
{"text":"If I have a Jen K's Top 10 Restaurant List, Joe Beef would definitely be on it. 

And in fact, I might even able to say My Last Meal on Earth I want to have it here. (Yelp's profile question and they do serves uni!)

I have been to Liverpool House, Joe Beef's sister restaurant right next door but Joe Beef is the real deal.

The menu is seasonal but interesting. A mixture of seafood and meat and even vegetables. And of course foie gras!

Everything we ordered were amazing. And the wait staff is just so knowledgeable with the menu and able to make awesome recommendations.

The vibe is relaxing especially out on the back patio on a nice summer evening. 

And of these for a reasonable price! 

Just make sure you make a reservation ASAP, Joe Beef is just so popular and definitely worth all the hype!"}
{"text":"So brunch up on your Francis before you come because there's only one menu and it's ll in French.  Trust the wait staff to recommend and be warned the portions may not look huge , but the food is very flavourful and filling.  Mushrooms in toast with four gras...amazing.  the tongue was moist and delicious and perfectly seasoned.  The lobster pasta really lived up to the expectation with perfect Al sentence pasta and just the right amount of sauce to cover. Must go back again and try more if the menu"}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed with Joe Beef after hearing about it for years and making a reservation months in advance. The soft shell crab was nothing special. I enjoyed the horse tartare but did not like the assortment of carrots it was served with. The steak was overcooked and we were never asked how was like it so we figured they would cook it medium rare. It came medium maybe closer to medium well. The lobster pasta was nice but nothing I'll be thinking about in the future. Also our service was horrible and people who were seated over 45 minutes after us were finished with their main dishes before ours even arrived. They ordered similar things as we did so there should be no reason for that. The waitress told us there was a problem in the kitchen when we voiced our concerns."}
{"text":"This was HANDS DOWN our favorite meal in Montreal. I was so EXCITED to get a reservation. Plan ahead if you are visiting the city! The restaurant is comfortable and unassuming. The staff is genuinely welcoming and happy to help guide you through the ever-changing menu. Our server even recommended a fantastic wine to pair with the meal. We loved it! 

We started with 3 kinds of bird pate - duck, chicken and quail. All were very good. I had the lobster spaghetti because I love spaghetti and I love lobster. I ate every last bite and it was so good. My husband had pork shoulder with sausage and little neck clams...The pork shoulder was very pink and very delicious! And who thinks of adding sausage on top of pork shoulder....a genius!

We ended with a parfait with sour cherries from the back patio. We joked that you can't get any more local than that....like there....like right there. :)

I highly HIGHLY recommend Joe Beef. Plan ahead and get a reservation, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Tip number one: make your reservation. 

We've made the reservation, but (our mistake) we showed up two days before the date reserved. 

The hostess was the best ever and said... \"hang on, you're stains with us tonight.\" We waited and believe it totally worth the waiting. 

We had a ragu d'agneau for appetizer... I just don't understand how they don't serve it as main course. Best ragu I've had in life. Could have it for dinner and go home. But no... we had the confit de porc as well. 

This is definitely my best place for meat."}
{"text":"It is good, but seriously nothing to write home about. Greatly disappointed. Scallops appetizer n pork main dish were decent but dessert was simply substandard. Service was terrible, my ice cream bowl was taken away from me before I could even finish it.  Just don't get the hype.

Two stars for seasonal food."}
{"text":"great place don't go if your on a detox it is heavy but all that fat is worth every single drop in your blood can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"There are already so many reviews here so I'll just say: get the marrow mash! So amazing. The food is so so so so good and worth the $. I would definitely return. 

4/5 stars for Joe Beef! It lost a star for a few small reasons that added up and irked me:  the chalkboard in French was overwhelming and stressful to take in and the service was slow. I got roasted by the outdoor heater on one side (my contact lens dried up, making it even harder to read the board...), and our table was weirdly huge and everyone was sitting 2ft apart (party of 4) in enormous chairs. The table was super uncomfortable for such a $$$ resto."}
{"text":"Je suis allée pour fêter mes trente ans avec mon copain. Ce que ça veut dire, c'est qu'en fait, on est allé environ 5 jours en avance et qu'on a dû appeler un bon deux mois en avance pour avoir une réservation. Et est-ce que ça valu le trouble? Je pense que oui!

Comme entrées, on a pris le double-down, une espèce de sandwich à la PFK mais avec du foie gras, puis les saucisses au homard. C'était bon et les portions étaient très généreuses. Pour le plat principal, j'ai mange ce qui était probablement le plus gros morceau de viande de ma vie, le tournedos de cheval. Cuit à perfection, je ne pouvais pas y résister et j'en ai probablement mangé beaucoup plus que ce que j'avais l'intention de dévorer! Puis pour le dessert, c'était une espèce de brioche avec un sorbet maison et des fruits.

Tout était très, très bon, mais vraiment, ce qui a été le plus amusant de la soirée, c'était le service. On nous a bien accueillis et notre serveur était bien gentil avec d'excellentes recommandations pour ce qui est du vin. Les autres serveurs/cooks/etc. prenaient aussi le temps de jaser juste pour le fun et ça donnait une ambiance à la fois relaxe et conviviale qui est surprenante, mais bien appréciée, pour resto avec une telle réputation."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The bone in ribeye is a must!  We met the owner David McMillan.   He was really cool.  Definitely check this place out.  We managed to get in without a reservation.  Where one man we spoke to made his reservation back in March!  My suggestion if you don't have a reservation is to get there when they open and ask to be seated by the bar if your party is of 2.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Oh my God, Yumm!
My Buddy had been frothing at the mouth to come up to Montreal and try this spot. Wouldn't stop talking about it, ha ha.
So we did.
We started with the Horse Tar Tar, and tell you the truth, with enough of it, that could have been my meal, it was soooooo goooooood!
He had the steak, I had the lamb.  The lamb was good, not great.  His steak was to die for. For sure I will be back and have the steak.

Tip: the servers in Canada are quite honest about what's good and tasty on the menu, so if they suggest anything, go for it! We almost balked at the horse tar tar, and it ended up being other-wordly!"}
{"text":"En général, très bon, mais quand même été déçue du crabe à la king... je m'attendais à plus extraordinaire les deux fois je suis allée.... overated un peu. Mais très belle ambiance, excellent service et bons choix de vin!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal: hands down, no contest, I want to marry it.
 I brought 3 restaurant-savvy New Yorkers with me for this food journey and they were blown away with how much Joe Beef rocks.

It was pouring buckets outside and the restaurant was warm, cozy and totally hopping when we arrived for our 7pm reservation. After standing there and trying to pick from all of the choices on the chalkboard, I finally hung my head and begged the server for her help. She laughed and then started listing her favourites. We ordered them all, everything from the duck, to the terrine to 3 types of fish. Every bite was incredible, tasty and knee-weakening delicious. The wine my dinner partner picked was perfect with all of our dishes, so good, that we ordered a second bottle.

The ambiance of this place is just plain awesome and I adore the buffalo in the washroom, he just makes me happy! This place is food porn at its best and I don't want help for my addiction."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and let Leo fashion your meal.  He was spot on.  His wine game is strong too.  Drove 6 hours from NY to eat there and it was worth the drive.  I crushed my meal there and almost went back the next night."}
{"text":"One of the most expensive meals I've had in a long time. It was delicious and expertly prepared but I don't think I was ready for the abundance of potent flavors that would come with just a few dishes. The service felt forcibly friendly but was good overall. The menu is written on a chalkboard and in French; though a nice touch it's hard to read and for duo-language tourists knowing Spanish it was semi impossible to. Expect to be looked at shockingly if you don't order wine."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal start to finish.  I wish we weren't so full because the desserts looked amazing too.  Foie gras was delicious as was the house tar tar (yes we are horse).  We also had oysters and the lobster spaghetti which was out of this world.  Waitstaff is friendly and speak English which is helpful when ordering off the menu which is in French. Would go back for sure but need to save up first as it was a very expensive meal (but worth it)."}
{"text":"Does this place need any review?  Just go here and experience a delectable experience youll never forget.  

first of all, Isabel whoever you are, made room for us even though it was booked for days.  Only in Montreal 2 nights i called in prayed.  She answered it and was able to squeeze us in on a busy Friday night.  I do not recommend this.  MAKE A RES A MONTH IN ADVANCE.

Horse Tenderloin. DO IT.  Lobster Spaghetti. DO IT. everything on the menu.  DO IT."}
{"text":"Joe Beef, a man after my own heart.  Figuratively AND literally.  Seriously I think my heart had a few pauses during dinner.  If I owned a food joint,  I would serve the same kind of food that chefs McMillan and Morin are doing.  Food that makes you die to live.

 Double down foie gras.  The ultimate breakfast sandwich.   Ok its breaded with chips and deep fried.  Wait for it...also Bacon and cheese inside? why of course?  Lets top it off with some maple syrup since we're north of the border and its gonna get cold in a few months.  These are a few... of my fav...o...rite things.  I don't care if its fat overload and I have no idea what's going on in my mouth and stomach right now.  DO you think I'm that high class? Just stuff it!   Like I said, these guys are brothers from another mother.  

Tuna with tomatoes.  They ran out of tuna so they replaced it with soft shell crab.  I ain't complaining.  But honestly, who told them I love soft shell crab?  Sorrry gurlfriend! (she doesn't  touch it ) More for me tehe.

Lobster spaghetti. Al dente on point.  Need I say more.

My lady got the trout.  Fishing awesome!  Of course at Joe Beef, nothing healthy goes untouched.  Its an obligation to slab some butter and thick cut bacon on top.  Cooked perfectly.  Skin was nice and crisp while the rest was delectably soft and melt in your mouth texture...oh and on top of cream of corn awesome sauce.  Probably one of the best cooked trouts that I've had.  

Patrick, our server, was most Excellent.  He knew his wines and was awesome at helping us pair our entrees.

Cheers to Joe Beef!"}
{"text":"My dinner at Joe Beef was one of the best I've had. It is not a traditional fine dining experience, but it is as good as casual dining gets.

The staff was super friendly and helpful. I found myself eating at the bar chatting with the bartender, waitstaff and even busboys about Montreal, the menu and life in general. They were never obtrusive, never overstayed their welcome in chatting and were always focused on their work.

The food was outstanding. The dish I remember the most was the foie gras double down, their riff on the KFC disaster. It was delicious and fun. 

Everything about my experience at Joe Beef showed that it is owned, operated and staffed by people who love food and want to share that love with the people who eat there."}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I've been here. This is simply the best food in the world. Get the lobster spaghetti and the horse."}
{"text":"When my good friend Anthony Bourdain came to visit Montreal, I made sure he went to Joe Beef. David McMillan and Frédéric Morin are the true sons of Montreal's Little Burgundy. 

Reservations don't come easy around here, as they say in life \"it's who you know and who you blow\" that makes a difference. Not willing to give Big Jim and the Twins a bath? Well, there's certainly a 2 to 3-month reservation waitlist -- but if you're lucky (2 or fewer people) you might score a spot a the bar. 

From drinks all the way the desserts, Joe Beef is certainly Montreal's finest."}
{"text":"Pricey, but good. Everything on the menu was pretty unique. Definitely get the cheesy fries."}
{"text":"A meat lover's paradise, you'll be stuffing your face with cholesterol pumping double down foie gras, perfectly prepared horse steak with its marrow, and savory eel croquettes. 

I will say, some of my party was slightly disappointed with their steak and sweet bread as some other dishes were more colorful in flavor, but I can't imagine finding a meat establishment that is as delicious as this place. If anyone knows of anything similar in NYC, please please let me know.

If the weather is nice, I definitely recommend sitting in the outdoor patio beside their garden. Drinks are great, especially their Bloody Caesar that's topped with an oyster."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: This was a birthday dinner, and I got some major perks as I didn't have to pay and also had a bottle of champagne sent to me from a friend. Still, this is in the top, top, top tier of dining establishments. I cannot think of a more excellent and exciting place to celebrate in glutinous fashion.

We did not really choose our dishes so much as discuss any likes and dislikes with our server. In addition to the champagne we started with the following:

Oysters - east and west coast. These were expertly shucked served on ice. Perfect oysters, amped up a notch by the house green habanero hot sauce.

Smoked Eel Croquettes with caviar - I heard about smoked meat croquettes. On our visit we received smoked Eel croquettes with dil, a drop of creme fraiche and a small puddle of black caviar. Damn, find me a better bite than this, because I sure haven't. Best bite of the night. 

Scallop Crudo - this was excellent, whole raw scallops out of the shell, with macadamia nuts and some sort of crisp plantain maybe? And a smoked creme fraiche. Succulent, sweet, smoky and briney, amped up by the nuts. AMAZING. Joe Beef nails seafood. Top 3 dish of the night.

Beef Tartare - again, perfect combination of flavors and textures. Must've been some sort of sesame seed or cracker mixed in along with dots of smokey aioli atop it. No need for crackers, you'll be fighting over this with a spoon. It may look simple but it's more complex and balanced, top notch tartare.

Sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage with shredded kohlrabi - I was happy to see this come out, as I know the Joe Beef team loves utilizing offal.  This was fantastic, fairly firm yet creamy sweetbreads in a thin wrap of cabbage. The sauce is insane with this dish. A reduction of foie gras and peppers, it tasted like a decadent, meaty yet thin queso. I would drink it if I could. 

Lobster Spaghetti (1/2 portion) - look, you know you have to order this. But trust me, worth the hype. Easy to pull the lobster meat clean from the shell, the perfect amount of bacon to add some smoke and salt to the dish without taking away from the lobster. Perfectly al dente pasta in a cream and herb sauce and ya have one of the best pastas in the world.

Guinea Fowl w/ Foie Gras - this was our meat entree. I was kind of hoping for duck or lamb, maybe venison or a steak even though my dining companion is not a big fan of steaks.  But I am thrilled we have this, nearly a whole bird with crisp skin and moist meat in a funky, slightly gamey and savory gravy sauce. With it came greens, frites, and mushrooms in brown butter. All of it with the gravy was fantastic. 

I get a bit blurrier after the champagne is finished, mix in a sherry with some cheeses and a cognac to go with their signature Mille Fuille and a vanilla/blood orange sorbet, and you have an unforgettable meal. To top it off, service was incredible and made me feel cared for and special. I don't like to claim anything is \"the absolute best\", but I have yet to have a dining experience that could possibly eclipse my meal at Joe Beef.

If you can get a reservation here, you absolutely must go. I beg you."}
{"text":"The food at Joe Beef is good. In fact, it is very good. The service on the other is not so good. Our server in particular was very pushy, in an almost used car salesman fashion.

My girlfriend and I split a starter of a full order of Foie Gras double down, and we were completely floored by how amazing it was. Solid 5 stars. 

Next we ordered the Cote De Boeuf, which was absolutely delicious! It came with 3 sides, and we couldn't finish anything that was put in front of us. 

The food here really is phenomenal, but the service really needs a huge overhaul. I would rate their service at 2/5, but since the food is so out of the world, I'm going to rate this restaurant a 4/5."}
{"text":"As I watched our cheerful server patiently (and entertainingly) translate the French-language menu in its entirety, I was at first dubious, then astonished, and finally delighted.  It was a glimpse into the workings of an establishment of humble origins that has gained acclaim as one of Canada's premier restaurants.

The service here is genuinely welcoming.  I am reminded of the graciousness that defines hospitality at a Danny Meyer restaurant.  Without hovering, our servers were there when needed.  From a fine wine list dominated by bottles in the triple digits, our server swiftly ascertained our preference for a lower end choice, then narrowed down a flavor profile in just a brief, bantering exchange.  It was near worth ordering a second bottle for.

An argument can be made for two bottles.  Although renowned as a meat-centric restaurant, Joe Beef is equally at ease with seafood, so a sampling of both is reasonable.  One of their more impressive starters were two whole, small trout showered with seasonally fresh vegetables.  The tender meat is gently smoked, yielding a flavor that is surprisingly restrained: enough to accent, not enough to dominate.  Shellfish shined in an equally wonderful sausage of lobster and clams; plump, juicy, and brimming with the flavors of its ingredients.  If the starter menu isn't enough, a few quality, local raw bar options are offered.  Raw oysters are de rigueur, but more interesting was a fresh uni prepared in a light tomato sauce and served in its shell, or the sweet snow crab legs.

Of course, it would be sinful to eschew meat at Joe Beef, which offers up a few sharable beef entrees, along with foie gras, Canadian smoked meat, duck, rabbit, horse, lamb, and chicken dishes.  Foie gras parfait is flawless; creamy and luxurious, perfectly offset by a bite of crisp, sharp radish on warm, crusty brioche.  The same brioche is molded like a nest around smooth horse tartare, although robust seasoning muffled the sweetness of raw horse.  Simple, expertly cooked duck breast was a marvel of flavor and succulence.

It is easy to see how this utterly charming restaurant is as famed as it is.  It is not for a specific dish, gimmick, or personality.  With its constantly changing menu penned only on chalkboard, Joe Beef announces its allegiance to local, seasonal foods, and prepares them exceptionally well.  Add to that the warmth of the staff and a uniquely home-like atmosphere between its cozy, tavern-like space inside and a festive outdoor area reminiscent of a patio.  It makes for a highly enjoyable, low-key dining experience that seems effortless in execution yet must surely be anything but.  And it will have one thinking about a return visit as soon as possible."}
{"text":"(*NOTE - From July 2012*) For the event of my convocation last month, I was provided with the choice of any restaurant in Montreal to celebrate. I didn't need to give it much thought - Joe Beef was the only choice for me.

For the uninitiated, Joe Beef is currently considered probably the center of the Montreal food scene and has been receiving universal praise from many famous chefs worldwide. The geniuses behind this restaurant are Frederic Morin and David McMillan - two well known chefs here in the city. They opened this gem in the Little Burgundy neighborhood of the city which is now an up and coming area but wasn't at the time they first opened up. The restaurant has an amazingly cool but unpretentious vibe. We got lucky and had a reservation in the backyard surrounded by the garden where they grow their own vegetables and herbs. Nothing quite like seeing the cooks come pick items fresh to use in their dishes.

Now for the meal... Decadent doesn't begin to describe it. Do not come here except a light meal. Everything is big, rich and meaty. The entree course provided us with fresh oysters from New Brunswick which were to die for. Nothing fancy but just perfect.

The other element of the entree course was truly the star of the show. KFC has the double down sandwich so Joe Beef decided to crank it up a couple of notches and provides us with the Foie Gras Double Down. It is exactly what it sounds like and simply the greatest thing I have never eaten... 2 pieces of fried Foie Gras with house smoked bacon and aged cheddar in between. I cannot possibly convey the experience other than to say you MUST try this.. Just don't tell your doctor afterwards.

The next course brought me Lobster sausage in a clam bake. Very good but after the previous course, it just didn't wow as much as I had hoped. Then again, I'm not sure how anything could really followed that double down. The one thing I forget to photograph was the side that came with this course - house fries tossed in garlic butter and Parmesan. That's right.... Garlic butter. They were as amazing as you think they would be.

The dessert course was their version of a baked potato - made of chocolate covered hard meringue, ice cream, mint and candied fruits. Very creative and quite good as well.

All in all, this was an amazing culinary experience that I will never forget. It is a pricy meal but worth every penny. If anyone asks me what is THE experience to try when in Montreal, Joe Beef is it. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent reviewer of things.  I am, however, a frequent reader of reviews and I hope that these few paragraphs will save you from making a grave financial and culinary mistake. 

My girlfriend and I first discovered Joe Beef five years ago.   We were looking in antique shops along Notre Dame when we stumbled upon this tightly packed, hole in the wall restaurant.  The menu was on a chalkboard, the waiters were kind and casual and the food was beyond divine.  We ordered about 24 fresh, sweet, New Brunswick Oysters, My girlfriend ordered the Lobster Spaghetti, I got the 49 dollar cut of steak with a slab of Roquefort Blue cheese.  It was delicious, expensive and worth it.  

The next year, it was just as good, the following, a little less so, and the same decline the subsequent year.  We skipped last year, because the owners were busy opening their new restaurant Liverpool House.

We both wanted to bring my parents to Joe Beef this year, especially because we missed out the year before.  

What a mistake. 

From the moment we arrived, I knew that Joe Beef had radically declined in the last two years.   

Joe Beef had died, and his corpse was sitting in a barely air-conditioned room with new tables and terrible food. 

It was empty at 6:30pm, our appointed reservation time; we were lead from a cool room into a hot back room.  My mother complained about the heat, she is a fit woman whose age I will not betray in this review, but suffice to say, she's earned the right to not sit in 85-degree heat while dropping 50 bucks on entrées.

We asked to be moved to a cooler area, they kindly obliged.  That was the last positive event of the night.

Here are the lowlights:

The waiter walked away from us in the middle of explaining the menu, he returned and hurried us to order, even though we hadn't fully understood the dishes available. 

After being rushed to order, we waited a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes for appetizers, and another 1 hour and 30 minutes for entrees.

My appetizer was supposed to be play on a Mac and cheese terrine with a duck egg on it.  It looked and tasted like the Chef took spam and mixed Kraft Mac & Cheese into it, fried it and put a chicken egg on top.  I know duck egg flavor and it wasn't a duck egg.

My mom's cold soup was luke warm.  The waiter fixed this, not by making a new soup, but by trying to put ice cubes in it and re-serving it.  This is a 20 dollar appetizer!

My steak with Gorgonzola was dry, grey and rubbery.

This was all happening as the waiter kept pretending that nothing was wrong, furiously refilling our waters like we were at a hot dog eating contest, and it's now 85 degrees in the once cool main room.

Finally, everything was SALTY, SALTY SALTY.

The waiter dropped the bill, NEARLY $400.00 with no discounts for the wait or bad service, plus an extraneous alcoholic beverage that nobody ordered. He apologized at the very end, once he was paid.  

We left, united in our dismay at what had happened and knowing that we would never go again. 

My girlfriend and I knew that we just attended the wake of Joe Beef.  

We had pits in our stomachs.

Or maybe that was just their heinous Eel Nuggets eating at our stomach linings."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant vous transporte dans une autre dimension. Une fois à l'intérieur, on oublie pourquoi on est venu. Mon dernier souvenir était d'être suspendu à la voix de notre serveuse, qui nous énumérait les plats, aussi originaux et alléchants les uns que les autres, sur leur ardoise, qui change constamment. Le décor est sublime, on ne pourrait attendre mieux de la part des chefs Fred Morin et David McMillan. Comme ils se plaisent à le dire, à ce point là, est-ce que c'est de la nourriture? Ou une exposition d'uvre d'art?"}
{"text":"One of my most favourite restaurants in Montreal- reserve early as they are usually booked far in advance. Don't come for a fast meal, you definitely want to take your time!"}
{"text":"The food is good - but I think the establishment is dominated by Liverpool House next door. Same owners. Very similar menu. Substantially lower price. Less need to reserve in advance. So at this point, I don't see the need to go to Joe Beef (despite its fame) and simply go to Liverpool House (which is really good!). I may be missing something here though.

One general word of caution: Don't go to Joe Beef (or Liverpool House) if you don't like heavy food. This can be said about several other notable places in Montreal (e.g., Au Pied de Cochon)."}
{"text":"I don't believe the hype.

The interior decor and atmosphere were nice. I found it casual and relaxing, and I really prefer that to a more formal setting with white tablecloths.

Following decor I expect service, yet I was let down repeatedly. I would have liked to have had more than one beer, and I even asked for a second beer (!) although I should have never had to do so! Apparently that was not something that the staff could handle, and so I had water with my meal - except that I ran out of water and could not get a refill! That would have not been a problem except...

My entree (appetizer) was quite nice, but I felt that the sauce with my lobster spaghetti was bizarrely over salted. I left with my mouth puckered and feeling covered in salt. That is something that should never happen. And in the end, for me, Joe Beef is something that will never happen again."}
{"text":"This is a meal, a place, a person you will never forget. I've visited Montreal and Joe Beef only once, and this restaurant already feels like a home away from home--it has a warmth and magnetism that urges me to return, especially when I need it most. The food, flavors, staff are undoubtedly filled with love. Everything is special about Joe Beef, from the creative ideas, to the process of trial and error, the care that goes into guests, the decor and atmosphere, the conversation, the taste. There's something safe and calm yet exciting and electric about it all at once. I want to be seated at Joe Beef's bar during the most horrific snow storm or maybe even the end of the world with a big warm plate of lobster pasta in front of me and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Found this place the last day of my holiday. I AM SO GLAD I DID !!! Great service, great food & great atmosphere !!!
Will definitely visit this little gem again on my next Montreal visit."}
{"text":"Joe Beef is a special experience that everyone should enjoy at least once in their life or in my case every chance I get.
I have never had anything but the greatest experience every time I step foot in Joe Beef, such a great atmosphere, great service and food that will just blow your mind and taste buds. 
Unfortunately now that I live out of town I don't get to enjoy it nearly as much as I'd like but that doesn't mean I don't dream about Joe Beef regularly.
Last time we were there we sat at the bar and left our whole order up to him, everything is always so good so why not leave it to somebody that is always surrounded by all this awesome and he really didn't let us down.
We started with a fantastic fresh salad with fresh house made buffalo mozzarella with grapes, basil, cherry tomoatoes, with a perfect vinaigrette. We then shared our mains. The first being an amazing piece of roast pork that had been slow roasted right out back in their yard and it was mind blowing and our second plate was a pan fried sweetbreads. both meals were flawless and I wish I could have them weekly. We then finished the night off my sharing their \"baked potato\" dessert which was a perfect end to a perfect night.
Joe Beef does it all so well and makes the experience of dining out so enjoyable. Love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly staff. The menu was a bit hard to read on the wall, so we opted to have the chef pick out a menu for us. I highly recommend doing this! He chose 3 appetizers and a main which was plenty of food, but not too much. The waiter also chose our wine for us (after we'd had our amazing Caesars first) which went perfectly with the whole meal. We'll be back in Montreal in August and will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"This is a food lovers paradise in a great pat of town. I sat at the bar because I was alone and didn't have res. I usually prefer the bar because it's like sitting in the cock pit of a jet. This is where all the action is. At Joe Beef the bar is also where the oysters get shucked. 
Max was on duty and made my dining experience extraordinary. My first drink of the evening was an old fashioned. I figured i'd take the bar tender out for a spin just to get a sense of the place. 
Max then suggested local oysters and I was grateful for the suggestion. My next course was a corn chowder with curds and broiled mushrooms on top. This is one of their signature dishes and I recommend it highly. On my second trip back to JB (I had to go back because I was drawn by the food gods) I ordered the chowder again and the presentation was completely different but equally as good.
On my first visit I ordered the broiled halibut which was served over a vegetables medley. Excellent. 
My drink was finished at this point and when Max asked what I was drinking next my slight hesitation was a signal for him to suggest a glass of wine which he chose for me and was perfectly paired with my fish.
On my second visit I ordered the tournedos de Cheval which in French translates to horse. We don't eat horse in the US but my niece who was dining with me reminded me of my commitment to food. So away we went. Our server suggested cook temp \"as you would beef\". I would highly recommend this dish as it was extraordinary. Tender, delicious and less fattening than beef. 
On my first visit I was offered profiteroles for dessert. Theses are light little pastry puffs made with home made corn ice cream. WOW! 
Joe Beef is the true definition of what a restaurant dining experience should be. Great atmosphere, extraordinary, inventive cuisine and a staff committed to delivering the entire package in an impeccable manner."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible terrible service, overpriced.

Having had the opportunity to dine at some of the best restaurants in North America, We were disappointed by joe beef. Largely, driven by an arrogant, condescending waiter who took the notion of 'our reputation exempts us from having to be courteous to our customers' too far. Its cute and edgy to have a single chalkboard menu etc. But when you are being asked for help with choices, pairing of wines - then do just that. I am not paying you for snooty responses like 'we don't do Cabernets period' or 'I can't recommend anything'. 

In terms of the food - I have had far better steak, fish, and shellfish than at joe beef. The prep and presentation were also lacking. I do appreciate the fresh ingredients, some of which were grown in an urban backyard. 

I would recommend so many other spots before you waste your time and money waiting for an over hyped restaurant."}
{"text":"Once we knew we'd be visiting Montreal for our 25th wedding anniversary, our next step was to research restaurants.  Joe Beefs kept coming up again and again. My husband wanted to try the horse (Cheval) and was not disappointed.  He said it was excellent.  He had it before in Toranto and enjoyed it. He was thrilled to see tonight's meal was served without a heavy blueberry sauce as before  - the meat spoke for itself. Not being a red meat eater, I chose a seafood dish and was also very pleased. The veggies are fresh from their garden and presented simply - which highlights their freshness. The menu changes daily, so we handed  our palettes over to the servers recommendations.  Everything was on target...a most memorable meal. Would go again if a trip to Montreal is planned:)"}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed with this place.  I know the ambiance is cute and all but way too cramped.  Literally I was so close to the guy next door he was part of the our conversation and butted in sometime.   I also personally don't like I can't read the menu on the chalkboard and need the waitress to explain.  It was hard to figure out what to eat.  Now if the food was amazing, all this is moot.  But it wasn't.  I got the chicken and it was dry and unflavorful.  It's probably just my expectations but me personally would not go back."}
{"text":"My sister and were visting from Philadelphia and while the details of our night are now a blur-we had a wonderful time from our host at Liverpool house(his name escapes me) he was friendly and made sure we relaxed and had our drinks without rushing and informed \"next door\" we were doing so. He gave us a tour of the garden and also came back to check on us mid-meal. Again, it was a wonderful night the food and the oyster-topped bloody mary my sister had was a work of art. I think that my dark and stormy rivaled any other I've ordered. I wish I'd written this review months ago. Thank you, for such a a memorable night!"}
{"text":"totally sick and disgusting - horsemeat
how sick can a human being be, eating horse meat? has to be a new low!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were lucky to get a reservation here while on a man trip from Boston. The place was packed and different from the normal big box restaurants typical these days. The staff was welcoming and seemed to enjoy their work. Our server was fantastic . She took time to explain the only menu written in French on a large chalk board on the wall in the middle of the dining room. We wanted the veal shoulder for the table and ordered it. We were disappointed when they told us they ran out, but got over it quickly with an appetizer of free eel balls that were delicious. I ordered again and am happy they were out of the veal. My friend and I split a dozen of fresh oysters served with a great mignonette. My friend and I enjoyed the Horse filet mignon wrapped in bacon and a large slab of blue cheese on top. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. The Horse was tender and flavorful.  I thank Joe Beefs kitchen and serving staff for a great evening and great food."}
{"text":"I got fooled into trying horse here!
Joe Beef had been on my list of places to eat while I was in Montreal. I've heard, read, and seen great things about this place. Got a ton of food while I ate here, but unfortunately since the menu is on the chalkboard AND in French, my friend and I had to ask for help and a translation. 
One of the items our waitress mentioned was a \"bacon wrapped steak\", not sure if she ever included the word \"horse\" in there, but I definitely didn't hear it. She also didn't ask my how I wanted my steak cooked, which I thought was a bit odd, but I didn't really think twice about it. It sounded good, so my friend and I decided to order that as well as the lobster spaghetti.
The steak comes with a sausage and my friend goes, \"I think that sausage is filled with horse meat...\" so after eating about half of it, we both decide to focus on the steak. The steak was soft, tender, and really delicious. I remember thinking how good and tender the steak was, and how it wasn't as rough as most steak.
When the waitress came by afterward, we asked if the sausage was filled with horsemeat. She said, \"sometimes it's beef, sometimes it's horse, sometime's it's half and half, but tonight it's all beef.\" My friend and I both sighed with relief... BUT she followed up that sentence with \"...but the steak was horse! How did you guys like it?!\" 
To be honest, I was completely horrified at first. Not necessarily an angry or upset horrified, more stunned. It took a few minutes to register I just ate My Little Pony, but I came to terms with it.
Everything that night was delicious and our waitress even gave us a bit of a dessert we were contemplating getting while choosing between two and picking the other option.
All in all, a great experience and an awesome place. I would definitely come back again and I actually would probably eat a horse again. Thanks Joe Beef."}
{"text":"It's very difficult to get a reservation. You have to book months in advance. 
It's a small cozy restaurant. Feels like you are in someone's living room. 
The menu is written on a chalk board and changes all the time. 
They left a big jug of water on the table. 
We shared a horse tartar for an appetizer. It was good but a little salty. 
We shared the Ambassador steak between the 2 of us and it was great. It was enough food but also cuz the appetizer filled me up. For a side order we got the rapinni (spinach) and it was amazing!
Tara Lee offered great service. She advised  us on the menu and translated it to English for us."}
{"text":"Was able to snag a last-minute, late-night reservation during our recent Thanksgiving/Birthday vacation in November. We were sat at the bar, which is BY FAR the better/more interesting area in which to be seated. Our bartender/server was engaging and well-opinionated on our food and drink options. 

I opted to the steak cheval, knowing it can be a controversial choice, and it's preparation/presentation was mostly successful. The true winner of the evening was my partner's rabbit entree: succulent, tender, and delicious! 

When we made mention it was my partner's birthday, the drinks began to flow! Celebratory glasses of champagne AND shots, many of which came to us gratis. The manager Alexandra  was simply INCREDIBLE: warm, kind, funny, gracious, and clearly loves what she does.

Would absolutely go back again. Just make sure to reserve well in advance!"}
{"text":"Possibly my greatest dining experience in my life. The food and cocktails were u precedents in their creativity and never ceased to amaze nor disappoint as wave after wave of beautiful and tasty dishes arrived at our table. Andi, our waitress was dripping with charm, she was attentive and a total delight. To cap off the night we had a long uninterrupted conversation with the owner Fred. He was a consummate gentleman, interesting conversationalist and generous with his time and attention. Afterwards he gave my fiancée a signed cookbook as she she was mildly star struck. We had booked our reservations 3 months in advance of our trip and dreamed of going for over a year. I could not have asked for more. Class act place filled with beautiful souls and some of the best food you will ever taste. Worth every dime."}
