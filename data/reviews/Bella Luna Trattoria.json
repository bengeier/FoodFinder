{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and not as I remembered. Remodel looks good but what happened to the pizza?  Used to be Gateway Grill (same owner) pizza except cooked on a wood fired grill.......no longer. A large with 2 toppings is about 1/2 the size of a Gateway Grill pie and the same damn price. Maybe they're catering to the $ in Murrysville???  I won't be back for Pizza."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable experience my girlfriend and I had at Bella Luna. From the cleaned and prepared seating, to the unrivaled drink prices, this was clearly the heavyweight restaurant of Murrysville. Excellent menu options, great happy hour and daily specials. Courteous and hardworking staff. Can't find anything negative to bring up against this affordable and inviting restaurant/bar. Compared to a nearby eatery of similar business approaches, NPL, Bella Luna made me feel welcomed and appreciated from the first time I walked in to this taste bud sanctuary."}
{"text":"We came here after the disaster at Pasqualinos. They have a much better handle on business and the food is just as reasonable. Very good Pizza."}
{"text":"Definitely have the best grilled chicken salad in town, good quality and massive quantity. That said, if we ever stray from that we're consistently disappointed. Pizza is meh, and while the modern bar remodel looks super nice it's a stark contrast to the still dated and homely styled dining area that is 3/4 of the building. Service is generally great and the beer selection is pretty consistent with what you'd expect for the area."}
{"text":"Overall I had a great experience at this establishment and I recommend the chicken parmigan (don't think I spelled that right)"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza you must try. Quick service good staff. Prices are affordable and its a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place just went thru a complete remodel.   The bar area is amazing, the outside seating is nice and the huge flat screens everywhere make it a great place for all occasions. My wife loves the fried zucchini appetizer The $12.95 New york strip special is well worth it and one of the juiciest steaks you will find.    The pizza is always yummy and the ingredients seem top notch. Check out half price pizza and appetizers after 9 (which was a pleasant surprise to us, and they now have buzztime trivia, where we stayed a few extra hours and were competing against other people. Their beer selection is getting better, but I would prefer get even better like their sister restaurant (Gateway Grill) 1 downfall is when the doors are open, the cigarette smoke from the smokers comes into the bar & dining area and that is disgusting.  Hopefully they install a windwall to eleviate this."}
{"text":"The Bella luna restaurant has great pizza,fried zucchini and salads,and many more very delicious,great foods!!!Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great wings and consistently good food. They have very good subs as well (the meatball and Italian sub were both great). Definitely a solid choice with lots of good options."}
{"text":"First visit Good Ribs, sides, good portions and price lousy sevice. Waitress was an absolute hot mess.  On second visit the service was good, but the ribs were yucky.  I'll tell you the truth this restaurant is like going to the casino a real crappy shoot.  Roll the dice and take your 50/50 % chance."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Visited Bella Luna for a Saturday afternoon lunch. To manage expectations - this place is a DINER...with that in mind, it's better than the smiley cookie one or the 24 hour one.  Bella Luna advertises in the Clipper and has online coupons, along with a VIP club that you can join.  We arrived during a shift change and were asked to seat ourselves, so we hopped into a booth in the bar area.  There are flat screen TV's with sports and were only about 4 other tables occupied, with 1 patron at the bar.  Even though there were only a few us of in the restaurant, we all represented a wide age range so there's something for everyone. We were greeted promptly and had a pleasant experience with our total service even though the servers really wanted to focus on their personal conversations with the others clocking in.  We ordered the fried zucchini - YUM - and the fried provolone wheel.  My husband had a cheese pizza and I had a salad with tomato, onion, fresh basil, mozzarella, fresh! greens, and an awesome vinaigrette dressing.  (See picture)  The food was great.  Our only issue is that there is a corner in the diner that has a bunch of signs advertising Bella Luna's desserts and variety of ice cream.  Unfortunately, our server didn't ask if we wanted dessert or offer a suggestion."}
{"text":"Best wedding soup in Pittsburgh. Love the wood fired pizzas. Wine is decently priced and generous pours. Comfortable booth seating and they have larger tables to accommodate parties. Service can be sketchy but I overlook it because the of the good food quality."}
{"text":"Full bar & restaurant. I always like it here. Nice draft selection. Lots of tv's around the bar. Their pizza is always good. This time we had a seafood pizza which was very good but was expensive, $25 for a medium.  Seafood included shrimp & scallops. We also ordered a meatball hoagie. It was huge w/ 7 or 8 meatballs and a side of fries. Service was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bella Luna pasta is delicious. Even better heated up. Maybe a tad too much oil.  Service is good.  Love the indoor/outdoor concept during the nice weather."}
{"text":"Great food but what's up with the gnats everywhere?  The waiter said it is because they open the big door in front but I'm not sure....I'm hoping it isn't an infestation in their carpets. BIG TURNOFF"}
{"text":"My family went to celebrate my daughter leaving for college. We decided to give them a second chance, the last time we were there the pizzas were not cooked well enough and were raw in the center and the wings had no sauce. See we love Gateway Grill who also owns Bella Luna, but Gateway Grill is hard to seat all 7 of us when we get two pizzas etc. So, we ordered two pizzas the pepperoni pizza not cooked enough and the topping slid right off, the Margherita pizza was good. The wings had enough sauce. My daughter ordered ribs and they were dry as could be! We sent them back and they new ones were worse.  Our server was extremely nice and took them off the bill - but we won't be back again. Not sure how two restaurants owned by the same owners could be so completely different."}
{"text":"Decent local restaurant.  Fried zucchini was cooked well and good but not uniquely seasoned.  Pepperoni rolls with sauce satisfies your \"pizza-tooth\". Wood oven pizza is thin-to-medium thickness and good.  Reuben sandwich has very generous meat portion (a little too much for me) but otherwise very good.  Wedding soup very good.  Many beers to choose from.  Lost a few points on poor service (meal brought out while finishing appetizers, water request not brought, didn't bring check) but probably isolated to us.   Place was neat, decor a little dated but overall a pleasant experience .  No problem walking in w/o a reservation Thursday evening."}
{"text":"I love to watch Pens games here. They have a great TV setup for watching sports.  Great beer selection!  Sometimes I come here just for the soups because they are worth the trip. I haven't tried too many things on the menu, but I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Bella Luna is, in one word; perfection. I don't live in Pittsburgh, but our family travels here 1-2 times per month. We always close our trip with a visit to this spot. No complaints whatsoever. Portions are huge. Service is prompt. Food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Dark dingy restaurant. Cold hard Pancakes obviously that are precooked and sitting in a warming tray as did my French Toast I actually think it was just Toast with sprinkled powered sugar because it was hard dry.. brown serve sausage. I was able to watch the host pick up dirty dishes from neighboring table and place in dirty dish area and stick her hands and grab out bacon sitting in a holding tray. While the waiter impatiently waiting for Toast to come out of Toast the walk around with 4 slices in his bare hands.  This was are breakfast after we ate. I personally wouldn't have payed for this but I got up to use restroom"}
{"text":"Unless you like a lot of garlic., I would advise you to avoid the pizza.  Very disappointed.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was even better than we remembered! But the service could use some help.  We hadn't been in a long while and decided to try Bella Luna again. Much to our surprise the interior has been updated and is much more comfortable. This time the service wasn't quite as good in the beginning, but was fine once we were waited on. After we seated ourselves (there is a sign telling you to do so. You can sit where ever you want.) it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to bring over menus and take our drink orders. Other tables that sat down after us were even waited on before we were.  We started off with the Provolone Wheel appetizer and it was quite good. I ordered the Luna Burger with Provolone, bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. The burger patty is grilled over a wood fire and served on a Italian roll. It was EPIC! One of the top five best burgers I have ever had! It comes with delicious fries.   My wife had the Grilled Reuben. It comes with corned beef and turkey, Swiss cheese, homemade thousand island dressing and sauerkraut on grilled marble rye bread and those same amazing fries. She said it was the best Reuben she has ever had! Our daughter got the Philly Cheesesteak. She loved it as well.   My wife and daughter wanted to go cups as they both hadn't finished their Pepsi so our waitress was nice enough to make us all to go cups of Pepsi to take with us as they finished their glasses they already had.   We regretted not getting a wood fired pizza as just about every other table had ordered one of some kind so we got a \"Giannetto\" (pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms) to go for lunch the next day. It was outstanding as well. I am finishing mine off as I type this.  If you like Gateway Grill, Rivertowne Inn or D's SixPax then you will love Bella Luna as well."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  The only thing bad I had was a Bloody Mary (sounded like a good idea at the time) - it tasted like Chex Mix.    I recommend their pizzas - excellent.  I wish they still had Sunday brunch... boo."}
{"text":"Update:  Amazing Cesar salad...homemade croutons and plenty of cheese to make a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Bella Luna has some of the best food around! Highly recommend. Chicken parm is excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent wedding soup!!! Love it and the salads are great. Huge and will have leftovers! Wish they still did the $5 pitchers throughout the week though!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at Bella Luna for a few years. They have great food and wonderful service. As another reviewer commented, they have a wide selection of beers on tap and an even bigger selection in bottles. I've been to bars with a bigger selection, but not many. I've asked the bartenders to surprise me several times and I've only had one drink (beer, wine, or mixed drink) that I didn't like and that didn't go with my food. I'm usually not willing to experiment, but it worked out nicely for me here.   Their menu has a decent selection of mainly Italian food and their appetizers and pizza are half priced in the bar after 9 PM on weeknights. I've never had a meal here that I didn't like.  They make the majority of their food to order when you place your order, so it takes a little bit longer to get your food and it is worth the wait!  They recently put a couple of tables outside on the sidewalk.  They're unusual because the restaurant is in a strip mall so the tables are on the sidewalk that runs in front of the restaurant, but since they put the tables out I haven't eaten inside.  Even when it's raining it's nice sitting outside in the fresh air enjoying your food."}
{"text":"I suppose you can call me a regular of Bella Luna. ;) Ok, i admit I enjoy this place and the staff. First let me start with some advice. There is a very nice large bar, tables and a equal size or larger for the dining only guests. Nice TV's everywhere. Some patrons at the bar can be loud....ME!...might say things i wouldn't want my daughters to hear. Sit in the dining room if you don't want to hear. Please!   Another good tip, especially for ladies. I find some portoins pretty large...lunch dishes are big. The rueben is definitely a split for two ladies. The fried zucchini appetizer is a monster but good. The stuffed banana peppers, the peperroni roll....you can sneak and eat these with a beer or two and you are ready to rock.  Anyway I went with the French Dip. Again this is a good size for a big guy. The meals are about $10-12 for lunch, about $15-20 for dinner. Decent draft list and service is generally very good. I think you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bella Luna for YEARS!  I mean for 5 years I used to work in the same plaza with family like coworkers and we would probably go here once ever two weeks maybe even more.    Now since the years of not being so close I still make my way to Luna's but mostly for Happy Hour.  They do offer discounts on domestic bottles from 5-7, and $2.50 Miller Lite drafts during Pens games.  Other than that I don't think they offer too many specials.    The food at Luna is somewhat inconsistent.  I admit I don't eat there much anymore, and if I do it is usually just an appetizer, but in the past I ate there much more frequently.  When I say inconsistent I mean one day their Grouper sandwich was out of this world and the next it was overcooked dry and flavorless.  I had some of the same issues with some of their other food. Their pizza I find to be way too oily though I love wood fired pizza. Their stuffed peppers were once made with basically no sausage stuffing but some kind of light or white colored filler, like bread crumbs.  We did complain and was told that the cook must not have mixed the filler with the meat prior to filling it.  Another time I was there I ordered there New York Strip steak meal.  It is a pretty good deal, you get the steak and two sides, and it used to be about 12.95.  Well I ordered it rare, what I got was a well done cooked steak.  The waitress asked and I told her and she quickly apologized (it was obviously not rare) and took it away.  The unfortunate part was that when she returned she informed me that they were now out of steak.  Well my friend was already finished with his meal and I had to look over the menu to reorder.  So I did and she comped my meal but it just set up for another of the reasons I don't usually eat here anymore.  But the place is really nice.  They did a remodel and it looks sharp with all the TVs and the bartenders all know your name what you drink and are friendly and attentive.  Also the back of my head is on their website and in their adds in the Clipper Mags!  (I didn't get paid any royalties) :)So this would definitely make my list for favorite local happy hour spots, or a spot to hang and watch the game,  but not so much for frequently eating here."}
{"text":"Decided to try their breakfast menu for the first time. What a disappointment! The dining area is dark and dingy, badly needs an update and better lighting . The server was more bland than the food. Despite having nearly no one in the dining room, service was very slow and not the least bit pleasant. Drinks remained empty and she even came to the table chewing her own food at one point  The food was mediocre at best. The omlettes were small and the mixed grill had little taste and was dry. Nothing about this place would entice us to return."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Try the Rubin...it rocks!   I have been going to Bella's for about a year now because a friend started working there. The atmosphere is nice no matter if you're there with a group of friends or taking your mom out to dinner...and yes, I have done both!   They have a backroom dining area, a private room for parties and at the bar seating.  Even around the bar area you have off to the side seating.  For those coming to the bar on game nights the have TV's viewable from pretty much every angle.    The menu ranges from appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, pasta entries and juciey steaks.  I have always been a Rubin fan, especially when the corned beef is thinly sliced.  The Bella Luna Rubin not only has thinly sliced corned beef but they add the fun of a Rachel by adding turkey to their Rubin...not for everyone's taste, but I luv them!  They also have daily specials.  I know Monday is their wing special, not real sure about the rest of the week. I'm sure they have it listed on the website   http://bellalunatrattoria.com/bars/bspro.cfm?id=2524  I like that they always have rotating specialty beers on tap to try out. Typically you will find the current Sam Adams, IPA's and a few dark brews.  I have yet to be disappointed by a hangout night at Bella Luna!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food and service here. Our server was a very sweet gentleman, but the refills were slow and we had to ask for a couple things twice. The kitchen was also extremely slow, considering we only ordered salads and sandwiches! We were there for lunch and there I think there were only two tables, so my like it was packed. After all the waiting, the food was definitely not up to par. I ordered the chicken Caesar panini (special)... the chicken was very overdone and dry. Also, it needed some kind of melty cheese to bring the sandwich together... there was only Parmesan mixed in with the dressing. Didn't seem like a panini to me. The Italian hoagie was very greasy and didn't stay together. One of the people said the caprese salad was pretty good. Overall, a miss. I'd give it a 1.5, but I'll round up to be nice.   We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken parm, very average. The pizza looked good, the tvs were great and service superb"}
{"text":"This place seems to have a cult following of people who really like to eat their food.  It's usually pretty crowded and usually has a sub-par wait staff (just calling it honest) that is pissed about something.  Not sure what that is all about, but it's been 100% for the couple times I've dined there.   The menu is varied - which is good for varying tastebuds looking for some Italian food, but I think the pizza is the best thing on the menu.  Portions ain't shabby, either...and there are plenty of beer selections.   This is a good place to go eat when no one can decide on a place to grub up and you know you don't want dinner to be at home."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here.  They have the best wedding soup hands down . We sat up at the front bar area today , in one of the comfy half moon booths. Made me feel like wanting to come here for a game or two on the TV. They have some nice big screens . 12 in the bar area alone. Might be my next destination so I can sit in comfort and cheer on the steelers while downing bowls of wedding soup...and maybe an adult beverage or two"}
{"text":"We were dining here for the first time! The Pens wee playing in the playoffs, but we were still seated rather quickly! The service was good and the wood fire roasted pizza was AMAZING! Though a bit pricey! We will probably go back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for wedding soup. Absolutely amazing. My other go to is eggplant parm. Everything though is really amazing. Ive never been disapointed."}
{"text":"Bella Luna has a great happy hour! Every weekday for happy hour they have 35 cent wings and different drink specials. Tuesday the drink special is a pitcher of long island iced tea for $5 and a pitcher of margaritas on Thursdays for $5! They are not watered down, and quite tasty!   The wings were good as well. There were 9 different flavors to choose from. The sweet and hot were very good! I will definitely get them again. It is pretty laid back in there, but you could make your own fun!!!"}
{"text":"Bella Luna is the place to be in Murrysville. Tip: if you're going during lunch or dinner make a reservation ! They get PACKED, so be safe and call ahead.  They have a good selection of beers, and a very large food menu. I've only had pizza, pasta here, but the experience was good. They have tables and booths around the bar and then separate section for dinning. In the summer it's really nice to sit in the bar area because they open the front glass windows completely up and you can sit outside, really cool."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars, but my past two experiences have been very disappointing. I have dined at Bella Luna probably 10 times in total primarily for dinner and occasionally for breakfast. I used to love coming here because the food was pretty good and reasonably priced with good service. However, the past two times I have been here the food and service have  been way below average.   One morning I was with a party of six for brunch; the server seemed to avoid us as much as possible. We all had ordered coffee and had finished our first cups before she came back to get our orders... this is not because we are fast drinkers its because she refused to come get our order. Then she never refilled our mugs until we begged a half hour later when our food had finally arrived. The food was only a 3/5 which was very disappointing because I have had good brunch there before. Depending on the dish it was either soggy, dry, or overcooked.   Then my most recent dinner experience the service was slightly better but on the opposite spectrum of our previous server. This server wouldn't leave us alone, I don't know why she felt the desire to ask us every five minutes if we wanted anything else but it was driving us nuts. The food this time was just okay. The spaghetti sauce was spicy which was very bizarre and the vegetables in my pasta dish were undercooked/raw.   I used to rave about their pizza and bella luna pasta dish but I just can't recommend this place anymore. I will probably come back and give them one more chance to get back to the great restaurant they used to be."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants so we have been frequenting here for years! The weekends can get pretty busy, but other than that we are seated pretty quickly. They have a very spacious restaurant area as well as a large newly updated bar and outdoor seating.   The wedding soup is delicious and one of my favorite items. My favorite dish isn't on the menu but they are so great about making it.. Grilled cheese with bacon and tomato!   The service is always great!"}
{"text":"Great food! Pricey tho...  It's got nice atmosphere and we were seated rather quickly. Got chicken and broccoli pasta which was great as was the chicken Alfredo. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average, service is sub par the few times I've been there. Our whole sales department just had lunch there and 1 person out of 7 enjoyed their meal and it was a salad (tough to mess up). Hoagies are served on a roll that takes away from any flavor the sandwich may have had. Pizza is wood fired, pretty good. Wedding soup was very good as well. Nice bar area to watch sports."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Bella Luna Trattoria several times. Pizza and hoagies mostly. I can't comment on the dinners, we are usually here for lunch on a Sunday before any sporting event, less crowded. We have eaten in the front at the bar area and also back behind, in the dining room. I like the pizza, it's wood oven made. It's not like Anthony's Coal Fire Pizza to me, but it is good. Try the Italian hoagie. We usually share a hoagie and a medium pizza. It's a desent restaurant, but not in our restaurant rotation list. I am not a beer drinker. It is not a good place for wine. Bella Luna has done a great job at marketing. They have their own app for rewards, they market in the local papers and there are coupons to find if you want to take advantage of them. I have no huge complaints nor do I have anything glowing to say. I would suggest a visit for yourselves. The food and service are good."}
{"text":"Pretty good service and good food. Prices are reasonable as the portions are big, except on the appetizers.  Wood fired pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food all around anything you order. Awesome service in a good area. Good to go to with family during day and also accompanies late night bar goers as well."}
{"text":"Bella Luna can be a pretty happening place. The restaurant was recently remodeled, there is a full bar in the front and the restaurant is in back.  We came for the wood-fired pizza. Service was good, and we got our food rather quickly. Although the pizza was tasty, its not worth the price (about $20/large 14\") for what amounts to a typical New York-style pie (thin chewy crust with lots of mozzarella)  I'd come back for more, but only with a groupon (like last time)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken special. I usually am well pleased with the meals I've had there. This one was dry. The entire table was served and mine was brought out about 10 minutes later. I think it was sitting back under the heat lamp. $7.25 for a craft beer. Didn't care for anything and it will be awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"Food was good Price was average. Service was good and the drinks were good would go back again . It was a little loud but not a deterrent if your are going on a weekend call ahead for reservation."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.   Had zucchini  no taste to it and very heavily breaded.  Had fish sand came with fries $12.50.  It was small for the price.    We Had a small pizza.  Wood fired but no sauce. Didn't like the taste of the dough.  The light hanging just above my table was filthy.   The one nice thing was our waitress who was pleasant and did a good job.   I will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Freshest pasta in Pennsylvania.  They have a very nice menu here with great outdoor seating. Don't let the strip mall location fool you."}
{"text":"Party of 9 December 23 evening.  Hostess drops off a stack of menus and walks away. The balcony had a cold draft so we moved down toward the back of the dining area to the right. Again, the hostess drops the stack of worn, old menus in the middle of the table and walks away. One of the speciality menus had a hair INSIDE the plastic cover. Normally, all of this would have me running, but my family wanted to come here, so I was trapped by obligation.  Had some IPA ale that was brown in color and if I had to imagine what dog piss tastes like , this would be it. My wife had a bourbon and coke, with barely any bourbon in it. Should have just had a coke with the lack of alcohol in the drink. Total ripoff. The fried zucchini was a tasteless joke, the Pizza was cardboard with a bad taste, and Marsala (microwaved) chicken which was literally rubbery to the point that we couldn't even cut through it.  No joke - couldn't cut through it. Unfortunately, this same meal was served to 3 people at the table. However, the wedding soup was ok and I had a wonderful rare slice of Prime Rib. The waiter forgot a salad for my brother, and he also forgot my vegetables. He explained that he was off from school and out of practice? Really? REALLY? Not to mention that the first meal at the table was served, and it was a full ten minutes before the next meal hit the table. Here's a tip Mr. \"Out of Practice\" -  serve all the meals at the same time. Makes life sooooo much easier and nicer for everyone. To the educated reader of this post - save yourself. Just don't go here."}
{"text":"Frozen chicken patty passed off as \"hand breaded and pounded thin\" on the menu.  Chicken parmesan shouldn't be hard to pull off for an Italian restaurant.   If you're going to be a bar that serves pizza, at least have an honest menu.  Tips were right about the wedding soup, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Happened to gather here on Sunday around 4pm, I was surprised that when I ordered a drink from there drink menu, that one if the bartenders didn't know what was in the drink, didn't know if they had the ingredients so you guessed it, she had someone else make it. If your going to sell drinks for $7 your staff should know what your doing. It comes down to training, not just winging it. Our waitress in the back room was great for a big crowd. Waitress gets two thumbs up, one of the bartenders, not so much."}
{"text":"horrible. just horrible.  where to begin?? it was obvious that there was a lack of management and training.. the front staff is clueless.   AVOID"}
{"text":"A bit of a limited review... since, in the past few years, we have only ordered pizza, BUT it is very good pizza. Beers are good. Generally you are seated immediately. Many TVs for those who like them. Us? We like the pizza and we have not found better anywhere else. Beer choices on tap are very good and varied.  One caution: there are different pizza makers on various nights. There can be some fluxuation on how the pizza is made. One day, great. Next day, so-so. Most of the time it is excellent.  We never... repeat, never order from pizza chains. If you really like pizza, go to Bella Luna. Eat in the restaurant. It is always better than if you take it home and reheat. You can enjoy a few beers while you wait and while you enjoy the great, fresh, hot taste.  (In the past we have enjoyed dinners at Bella Luna too.)"}
{"text":"They have a nice brunch - good omelets and french toast and the like. Dinner is ok. I look at Bella Luna as a great place to grab a bite if you're more interested in the game than in the food. Good service in the bar area. Good selection of beers. But in the restaurant area, their entrees are nothing to write home about. They're fine. Certainly not bad. If you're looking for a local joint to grab a perfectly fine dinner with a bunch of friends and watch the game, Bella Luna is a good option. Nothing wrong with that,"}
{"text":"I was here for a bridal shower - so they served up a Pittsburgh salad bar - chicken, steak, lettuce, etc...and FRIES.  This review is simply for the fries.  They have really really really good fries.  If you go, get the fries."}
{"text":"Pizza=A+. All other food =C. Wait staff=terrible. Hair and decor= 1985. Get Robert Irvine up in this place now!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am usually here to dine, not for the bar, so this review is based upon dining here. Their wood fired pizza is delicious, as are most of their menu items. The chicken is always cooked perfectly. The portions are large and generous. The dessert menu isn't huge, but their desserts are good. Nice drink selection. The atmosphere is nice too and there is always a good view of a TV. The staff is super friendly, and the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"You like pizza you say?  Well, if you LOVE pizza and want one of the best wood fired pizzas available in the metropolitan Pittsburgh area then get in your car and head East my friends!  Bella Luna knows how to do pizza right and has a beautiful wood fired oven to bake it.  Located a few miles off the Parkway East on Rt. 22 at the entrance to Murrysville (see a sign that says \"Gateway to Westmoreland County\" and you're in the wrong lane to get to Bella Luna) this restaurant is a gem for an area dominated by fast food and chains (although there are some new places coming up).    As someone who was born and raised in the area I've watched Bella Luna blossom from just an ok restaurant for locals to a destination pizza spot.  Several years ago they remodeled and doubled in size.  There is a large bar with a garage door window to open sidewalk seating in nice weather.  Many flat screen TVs playing local sporting games.  Lots of beer on tap and even a nice selection for six packs to go.  They also have private rooms for banquets and showers.  In addition to their many wonderful pizzas they have a nice selection of appetizers (try the artichokes!) and sandwiches.  Recently I had the grouper sandwich Cajun style.  BOMB.  Which reminds me, during Lent they have fantastic fish sandwiches.    I'm partial to this place since I grew up in the area but I'm also here to say that a discerning non-Murrysville resident would not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Once you have experienced Anthony's Pizza close by or a Sunset pizza in Greensburg you will not want to waste your time at this place. I have learned I became spoiled eating at both Anthony's Coal Fired Oven in Monroeville and Sunset Pizza in Greensburg. My bf and I went here for the first time word of mouth from someone who raved about Bella Luna. We sat at the bar, layout was decent and a nice vibe. The bartenders were okay, first drink handed to me was over flowing which then spilled everywhere. We ordered food and had to nearly flag them down for basic things like clean plates, red pepper flakes, and additional sauces for wings. The place we sat at the bar, an air conditioner vent was located, which dripped on my bf the entire time we had drinks and food. I thought this made for an unpleasant dining experience, who wants to have drinks and food with an air conditioning vent leaking on them... I would say not most people. Overall the food was mediocre, nothing great or \"WOW\" factor. Go to Anthony's for an excellent dining experience and great pizza and GREAT food overall, don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Food is ok... not worth the price... and wait staff is uncaring. We really wanted to like this place and tried a couple of times but we just don't care for it. We shouldn't have to get our own menus and find someone to wait on us.... and then pay $30 for a pizza and salad. There are too many good restaurants in Murrysville to settle for subpar."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Exceptional bruchetta, delicious pizza and dinners have good portion sizes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a beer after work or a mid day lunch. The staff always seems just ok. I got a burger it was par. Cooked properly just barely seasoned."}
{"text":"We love bella luna. Always great beers on tap.  They have one of the best pizzas in the area as well! ( if you prefer thin crust) you also can't go wrong with the salads. They are huge! The bowl almost looks like it is a serving bowl.  We continue to come back to bella luna because of the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Used to be a lot better. I like the remodel, but can we get a bartender that actually wants to wait on someone that isn't their friend? We like to sit in the bar area and watch the tvs, but they're you feel uncomfortable as it is like you are bothering them. One time we were told we couldn't sit at a table because it was being saved. When someone showed up they were obviously the persons boyfriend. I didn't appreciate that."}
{"text":"I have been to Bella Luna numerous times in the past three years and it never fails to satisfy! They just went through a re-model and the place looks great! Much more modern and welcoming. I have had many things on the menu, from pastas to sandwhiches to pizzas and without a doubt my favorite item is the fried zucchini appetizer. It is without a doubt the best fried zucchini I have ever had. The breading is light and crispy and the zucchini still tastes fresh and not the least bit mushy. I have ordered a small zucchini appetizer and a bowl of wedding soup and made it a meal and it was absolutely perfect. Great restaurant for a date or for taking the whole family."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when traveling from Ohio to Maryland. So glad we stopped here, the pizza and salads were awesome! Never heard of French fries on salad but it worked..  We also had great service from Melissa. We would definitely stop here again if we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed some good appetizers and wedding soup.  Husband enjoys the selection of the beers on tap.  Wish they had honey for hot tea,  since I was feeling a bit under the weather.  But the artichoke Romano App was nice and lemony,  and I couldn't help myself but broke into my happy food dance over the potato skins. I like the open air patio option.  Not really into sports but they have a lot of TV s."}
{"text":"A great wood fired pizza place in murrysville. Had the caprese salad which was fantastic, they make their own cheese. Our waitress was perfect, attentive, but not annoying. My only criticism is that is is quite pricey for a pizza place and the ambiance isn't great."}
{"text":"Very confusing seating situation, host staff come across as very unorganized. They will not talk to you until you approach them. Entrance and exit use same hallway, causing congestion for those who are waiting to be seated. Food is good. Atmosphere is acceptable."}
{"text":"I judge many places by their wings and Bella Luna's wings were dry, small and not very good. Went here for a company celebration and thank goodness, because I would not have wanted to pay for the dry, skinny pieces of pizza and grumpy service. They had a skimpy, tasteless salad and a small variety of lunch items. I would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Bella Luna is generally crowded on the weekends.  My wife and I came here on a Friday night.  We got there about 6 and were able to get a table very quickly.  It was a pretty long wait when we left at 7.  The service was fast and friendly.  My wife and I had fish sandwiches in our heads.  I like the fact that they have three choices of fish sandwiches.  I had the crunchy grouper which was good.  My wife had beer battered haddock.  The third choice is a traditional cod.  Im a big fan of their beer-battered fries.  Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"Hello,  I have to tell everyone about this awesome experience we had when we went to Bella Luna for lunch!!!  we went in and were seated by Luke. Greeted promptly and he took our drink order and appetizer order. The bruschetta is delicious!!! Yum!!  I also had a salad with their homemade ranch dressing ( which is to die for!) and I ordered a fish sandwich my friend ordered the panini which he loved!!!  Luke was very attentive and was GREAT with my daughter!! ( thank you!!) Most servers are annoyed with children. Everything was delicious and the service was awesome!!!  Thank you so much for a wonderful lunch!!!                                           April"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and I like the atmosphere. They have outdoor seating too which is great on a nice day. Their brunch is my absolute favorite! Huge portions. The pizza is a little on the expensive side but it's definitely done right."}
{"text":"The positives of Bella Luna, which I think just started serving breakfast, was that the coffee was very good and the staff were very attentive and friendly. But there were some negatives.   First of all, they don't poach or baste eggs, which is somewhat odd. I understand that some places don't poach, but basting eggs is a technique that doesn't necessarily require \"special equipment.\" It MAY take a couple extra minutes to get water or something, but they weren't busy at all, and I don't think that would have been much of an issue for the kitchen to handle.  Secondly, they have limited bread options; they don't offer English muffins or any type of Italian bread, which is even more odd than the egg situation, being that it's an Italian restaurant. They did offer my wife cinnamon raisin toast as an option, even though it was really just for the french toast meal. So that was a plus.  We both got the spinach frittata, which was OK, but nothing special. The best part of the meal was probably the side of fruit, which was a nice size and pretty fresh.  We have been here for lunch, and we would visit again for lunch or dinner. But I don't think we would ever stop here again for breakfast."}
{"text":"We just  had 2 Friday night specials, crab and shrimp in a red pepper ravioli with vodka sauce, and shrimp and scallops in a garlic butter sauce over pasta. Homemade pasta. Reasonably priced. Delicious!"}
{"text":"In the pizza limited city of Pittsburgh, this is one of your better bets, especially if you do not care to venture and fight the traffic in Squirrel Hill. They have a wood fire pizza oven that they proudly show off, and use pretty good ingredients. The cheese on our pizza was very tasty, and the pizza came out nice and hot. The decor is simple, and really more of a family restaurant type of atmosphere. It was quite busy inside. If you are out in the Monroeville area, it is one of your better bets. The wings were also good - nicely fried, good sauce, and good sized wings."}
