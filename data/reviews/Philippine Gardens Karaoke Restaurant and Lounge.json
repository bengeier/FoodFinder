{"text":"Based on previous that labeled it as 5 stars. Our experience tonight was based over the reviews that were posted. Upon arrival, not only was the establishment small there were no customers and the menu was limited to everything and nine dollars and above. In a party of eight, We ordered shrimp fried rice, lumpias, sing sing, and other Filipino delicacies, and it did not serve to par. The mixed drinks or eight dollars for a very watered down alcohol, and The chicken was raw and undercooked. The establishment was labeled as a five-star local bar and karaoke, however it had a very big gay club atmosphere.  the karaoke menu was very limited and just not living up to the 5 star that was reviewed on Yelp. Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. Ordered chicken wings and it came out raw. Drinks was pricey for late nite. Food was pricey for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Authentic Filipino food with great atmosphere and great servers/waiters who connect with you. The Late night hours make it a First thought after a long night of clubbing. The karaoke machine makes it 10X funner. Great service, Karaoke, and dope people make a great time!"}
{"text":"It was a triple birthday celebration in December- some years ago. The catering menu was pretty good. Negotiating was easy enough. The pricing was reasonable. We had the night booked. It was nicely decorated for the holidays- festive with lights. The service was really good. It was a good time. Singing, dancing, eating, drinking- the party went off without a hitch. Until one of the birthday celebrants had forgotten his gifts at the bar- a huge bottle of alcohol and a sweater. I just thought that it was shady that no one said \"We found it- we were waiting to hear from you.\" I have to be completely honest, it was disappointing."}
