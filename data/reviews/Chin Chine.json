{"text":"We were 3 on a Thu nite. Poor service from hostess. One menu missing and cold recepion. They have a soup, salad and desert bar with every main dish. The all you can eat menu guarantees freshness. Though the portions are small, over order the plates (2 portions rather than one) for the al a carte selection. If you order the full plates, they are a good size. The won ton soup at the buffet is tasteless. The hot n sour is ok. The salad bar is limited and so is the desert. Lunch time the prices are reasonable. Supper is a little more pricey. Large bright dining area. Popular on weekends. Make reservations. Meals are tasty and served hot. Good pad thai and chow mein . This a better choice than the buffet down the road. I would have given them  3.5 stars but the food is quite good. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Busy Asian restaurant on the 132 and I honestly can't tell you why. It must be so busy that they can't bother cleaning the tables. Ours had dry stuck on food all over it.  Menu has a good variety of Asian dishes ranging from General Tao to Pad Thai. I opted for the salt and pepper shrimp cause it had the spicy symbol beside it. It comes accompanied with vegetables and your choice of white or fried rice. Fried rice is basically everyone's leftover rice soaked in more soy sauce and reheated. Disgusting. The deep fried battered \" salt and pepper \" shrimp tasted like blocks of battered salt. You can only taste the oil they are fried in with salt. No pepper, no spicy; pure vegetable oil and salt. I couldn't eat more than 1. The vegetables seemed fresh so I ate those. My partner took the general Tao and had the same consensus: overpowering taste of oil. They were crispy but a lot more batter than chicken. My aunt had the pad Thai and said it was passable but lacking spice. It was far from the best she's ever had.  On the positive side the soups at the complimentary salad bar were good. The waitress actually inquired why we didn't eat our meal and did offer to replace it with another one which was nice. Most restaurants have a too bad so sad attitude.  You can be sure I'll never be coming here again. Only reason I came this time was because it was part of a large family outing.  Do yourself a favour and drive 15 minutes to Brossard and you'll find better Asian food."}
{"text":"We were stuck between the U.S. Canadian border for 3 hours so by the time we got to the area, everything was closed other than McDonald's and this place. We knew we got ourselves a Panda Express when we saw the menu, but we were keeping our hopes up seeing the full Chinese staff. We probably shouldn't expect much when the lady at the front had to be like order this if you are Chinese.  I haven't had Panda Express since high school so I only remembered that it was horrible, but forgot how it tasted. This place definitely was not better if not worse. Do not expect actual Chinese food from here. We ordered a combo and everything wasn't great. Chicken fried rice had nothing, but old rice soaked in soy sauce. There was not a single piece of chicken in it.  Two stars for friendly service and opening late, but I would avoid if you are used to actual Chinese food."}
