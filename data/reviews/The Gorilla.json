{"text":"Simply OK.

Pondering about something I eat I saw this place delivered - and never tried it before so figured I'd give it a shot.

Got a side of Mac and cheese and the Jimbo sandwich (brisket, horseradish, etc)

Delivery time was really quick, which is why I was surprised the Mac and cheese was so damn cold when I got it.

I suspect they make a batch, keep it refrigerated and microwave as needed - or they have some other premade product they keep refrigerated I'm not sure. Either way it wasn't microwaved enough because it was room temperature or below when I got it. 

After heating it up myself it was still \"meh\" slight tobasco like spice but otherwise rather flavorless. It also wasn't really macaroni and cheese - more like penne/rigatoni and cheese (big noodles)

The Jimbo sandwich was good, everything was good on that and pretty tasty.

I know this is a quick grab-n-go ice cream/sandwich type of place - \"average\" just don't get the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Reaaallllyyyy good sliders. I got the Prime King. It's messy for sure, so have napkins on deck! But it was delicious. Great for afternoon lunch. In the summer this place will be the hang out spot for sure. They have specialty hot dogs, shakes, and ice cream too. Definitely a place to take the kiddos for a treat. Only have 4 stars because my hot dog was kinda undercooked so I didn't finish it. Customer service was awesome, and it's cheap!! Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I've only had their food from the grill outside. Ribs were amazing. Chicken was good as well. I would recommend them. 
My friend enjoys their slushies and soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"This may be the most disappointing bbq I've ever had. While it was relatively cheap compared to other local bbq joints, you get what you pay for. The brisket was way too fatty, the sauce was flavorless. My wife got pulled pork, which she had to pull apart herself. All of the sides were bland. I had high hopes, and this was such a letdown."}
{"text":"Updating this review because in early August, The Gorilla changed BBQ suppliers.  The original guy (BoBo's Smokin' BBQ) is not providing the meat any more, so they have a new supplier and a new BBQ sandwich menu. Although the pork BBQ has improved a little bit (not as dry), the new brisket is nowhere near as good as the previous tender and juicy brisket. The new brisket has the taste and stringy consistency of meat steamed in a double boiler.  For a five dollar sandwich it is OK, just OK.  I won't be traveling out of my way to get their brisket any more like I was doing when BoBos was providing it, and I will be getting the pork from here on out. The baked beans on the new menu are decent.  

I was also less than impressed when I ordered an Italian sausage here a couple weeks back (when they were temporarily without BBQ) and discovered they had served me a bratwurst instead...with too much mustard (why can't we put the condiments on ourselves?) Since I've had two bad experiences with their hotdog menu now, I won't be getting any more from here."}
{"text":"You gotta love hot dog stands! Wish there were more of them. Had a great chili dog here today along with a grape soda. Sit on the mister cooled patio and enjoy the scenery!"}
{"text":"Well, at least I tried it.

The mac and cheese was cold, plasticy, and frankly inedible.
Tried the pulled pork- bland, over sauced with sugar and bacon bits.
Tried the ribs - wasn't the worst but not the best.  
Tried the beef brisket - meh.
Beans...too much of nothing good.

It was all cold.

Service was a bunch of teens in a hut on their phones."}
{"text":"I could arguably give this 5 stars, but 4 seems appropriate. I haven't had the hot dogs yet, but I've had Bobo's sliders on two occasions (yesterday and the day they opened in April).  The Original Bobo's (beef brisket) is sublime. Perhaps a bit messy, but I wouldn't change a thing with it. Some might argue that these are a tad pricey at $5, but they are biggish for sliders, and the quality of the smoked meats and attention to detail justify the price point. Really well-executed.  The Hawaiian is unique and very tasty, too.  Bottom line:  delicious, and one-of-a-kind in the CLE.  Oh, and the soft-serve is good; it tastes like soft-serve."}
{"text":"I went to The Gorilla for lunch with my husband where we had the worst BBQ food we have ever experienced. When I think of BBQ, I think of having a very flavorful and juicy experience. We were met with dry, bland meat. The meat had no flavor whatsoever. The coleslaw had no flavor whatsoever. The mac-n-cheese had no flavor whatsoever. To make matters worse, our sandwich portions were nothing like the pictures shown. We expected a sandwich with meat piled high. Instead, I had a brisket sandwich with one slice of brisket. After spending $20 on food, it was a huge disappointment. We will never be going back, and I would never recommend this establishment to my friends or family. The ONLY good thing about this place was the outside eating area."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. Service was awkward and not too friendly. They forgot something in the order. Ice cream was just okay. I think I'll try again, but not right away."}
{"text":"Took a bunch of co-workers here on a recent weekday to experience some 'Que in an outdoor setting (before the Cleveland weather changes for the worst!).

I was originally going to go with one of their sandwich creations (Jimbo was going to be my call), but saw the Taster Sampler on their advertisement board and changed my mind at the last second.  Several sides to choose from (mac-n-cheese, beans, cole slaw)...I went with mac-n-cheese.

The meal was severed in a styro to-go container and weighed a ton!  Meal came with one rib, pulled pork, pulled brisket, an undetermined biscuit and my side of mac-n-cheese.  The rib was served spare rib style and has sauce already applied; it was tender and the sauce was only slightly sweet (not bad).  The pulled pork was a generous serving also with sauce applied and was tasty.  i was disappointed in the brisket being that is was pulled/chopped...I would have much more preferred to have it sliced (more traditional).  The biscuit had a weird shape to it and was hard as a rock.  The mac-n-cheese noodles were like rigatoni style (an odd choice for this side) but the flavor was decent.  I finished my meal with a treat, the hot fudge sundae which was also filling and the hot fudge was very warm and tasty.

All in all I'd put this meal in the \"Meh\" side of things, but I'm thinking i will return as those folks who ordered sandwiches thought they were pretty good, and the Jimbo is still on my radar."}
{"text":"BBQ, hot dogs, and ice cream. I didn't try the hot dogs, as I don't like hot dogs. But the beef brisket is very tender, and their bourbon sauce is very delicious. They could find a more flavorful bun, though. The sandwiches are very good, but a bit pricey ($9). Haven't had any ice cream yet. It's outdoor seating, so great for summer eating."}
{"text":"I was really looking fwd to trying this place yesterday especially being Memorial Day weekend  When I got there I was told \"sorry, we don't have any BBQ tell Tuesday\". Whaaaaaaat?!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for a small quick dinner with my family when they were visiting.  I had read good things about them from the Scene, and they were OK.  The hot dogs are definitely nothing special.  I think this could be easily fixed if they would just offer an all beef or quality dog with everything and get rid of the cheaper ones altogether. I also tried the mac and cheese which wasn't bad, good homemade quality but the portion size was definitley not worth $2.  The rest of my family tried the BBQ brisket or pork sliders which they all said were fantastic.  

My only big gripe is that when we arrived around 4 pm on a Saturday they were out of many of the BBQ items.  There was no turkey, no chicken, and we got the last of the brisket that was available.  

If they work on their stock portions and improve the hot dog portion of the menu this place has the potential to be a great little find in Lakewood.

We will likely visit again for the BBQ and maybe for an ice cream treat for the little one but I am in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Our new go to place for ice cream both my kids love the soft serve. The new patio is great looking and as always the gorilla."}
{"text":"Decided to give this spot a shot after reading the review on Scene and I'm glad I did! I decided to try a little bit of everything-- 1/4 slab of ribs, original bobo slider, hot dog and Mac & cheese. The Bobo slider is FANTASTIC. The meat is cooked perfectly and the sweetness from the pickle/coleslaw is a great complement. Be warned though- the sandwich is messy and if you decide to take it home it can become soggy if traveling long distances. The \"slider\" is huge though! The Mac and cheese is obviously homemade and tastes delicious. For $2 I wish the portion size was just a bit bigger. The hot dog was cooked to perfection but the bun was a bit flaky (still good). The ribs are St. Louis Style which I'm not a huge fan of, but the spicy mustard they put on it was on point!

Service was a bit weird. Not all of my menu items were included at first so I had to go back to the window after I inspected the bag. Cashiers were ok but not overly nice/upbeat. The to-go containers are also a bit weird. My ribs were given to me in an open-faced container (no lid) and put in my to-go bag with other products so the sauce literally got everywhere.

Overall this place is a great addition to Lakewood. The few complaints I had all feel like they can/will be corrected once the restaurant gets a little experience under their belts. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool atmosphere, nice to take some pics with the giant gorilla.

Small selection of food, and ice cream, but its a nice place to stop.

We went with hot dogs and cheesy fries. The fries were under cooked a bit, but with being covered with cheese I could deal with it. 

I really enjoyed that it was dog friendly. They had water bowls set out, and even offered an ice cream treat for them."}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog! I heard this place was opening so my son and I stopped up for a Saturday afternoon bite .  This is a cool little spot with a giant gorilla for photo ops in the back corner of the lot.  You can get BBQ fare, hotdogs,  slushies,  and finish it off with some ice cream if you like.  The hotdogs were hot, and the available combinations were excellent. I ordered the Bigmouth which is  a Chicago style with sport peppers on it.  The gentleman serving us was very courteous and efficient.  I'm stopping back to try some of the barbecue offerings soon. The gorilla is a carry out stand and does have some outdoor seating available. (As long as a 10 ft,  3000 lb. gorilla doesn't scare you away )

On the most recent trip I opted for the BoBo slider with a side of spicy beans... Somebody stop me I'm smokin! The brisket was tender, flavoricious and plentiful to the point I couldn't consider it a true slider. Given the quality of the creation, I think the price is just right. The beans were zippy but not too spicy. The owner waited on me and his passion for barbecue was evident as he described the beans to me. (They have brisket in them) 
I really like this place and will be treating guests to their culinary delights for some time to come."}
{"text":"Had the Pork Hero and I was delicious. Only issue I had was the bottom bun was complete mush. An easy suggestion that would fix that somewhat and add to the sandwich would be to toast the buns! Toast them buns, please!! A buttery toasted bun with those sandwiches and you got a five star sandwich."}
{"text":"A decent, unusual, somewhat retro outdoor bbq and hot dog joint.  We only had the hotdogs, which were ok.  Way too much bun to meat ratio on the \"upgraded\" dogs. Might go back to try the bbq.  The food is ok, but the outdoor atmosphere is really why one would go here."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday around 8pm and they were all out of meat so I tried again on a Saturday around 12:30pm and success! The manager let me know that I can always call ahead and place an order so that it will be there since lately they have been selling out well before closing time. The building is a little ice cream shack that you walk up to and there are 3 parking spots in front, but there is a lot of parking along the street. The staff does seem to be younger and they didn't come across as very personable (no welcome greeting), but they were nice and helpful when I asked about the menu. You can get your food to-go or you can sit at one of the several picnic tables and enjoy your meal outside. 

I went with...
-The Original Bobo: brisket, coleslaw, pickles, bbq sauce. 
-Lickity Pig: pulled pork glazed with mustard and apple butter, coleslaw, bbq sauce.  
-The Hawaiian Hillbilly: boneless chicken thigh with skin on, pineapple ring, cheddar cheese, bbq sauce.
-Side of Baked Beans.
-Side of Macaroni Salad.  (They switched over from Mac & Cheese but hopefully they bring it back). 

For the food, everything is homemade which I am always a fan of. A word of caution though, you'll definitely need to wash your hands and face after you eat one of these sliders because they are loaded with sauce and are pretty messy. The size of the sliders is actually about the size of a regular sandwich with plenty of meat on them and I think one slider with a side is plenty for a meal to fill you up, but if your stomach can handle two sliders without bursting then the more the merrier! The Hillbilly seemed to actually be made with skinless chicken breast meat, but it was moist and flavorful. The brisket had a big chunk of fat and along with the pulled pork both were on the drier side so slightly chewy, but still flavorful and I liked the touch of black pepper. The Lickity does have this unique cinnamon apple taste to it which I am guessing is from the apple butter?

The sliders are $5 each (max price you can charge for this in my opinion), but I did find a coupon in the mail for buy one get one half off. The sides are $2 each and come in 5 1/2oz containers which does seem a little small, but at $7 for a slider and a side I think it's a decent price for what you're getting; I would not pay more. As for the taste, the baked beans were not bad with a mild chili flavor, pieces of brisket, green peppers, onions and I think I saw three different beans in it. The macaroni salad was pretty standard with green peppers, onions, carrots and a mayo based sauce. Nothing to write home about. 

Overall I would definitely hit this place up again! Maybe next time I'll even try the milkshakes."}
{"text":"A decent little stand that was recommended to me. I got the SAMPLER. Very good. A little taste of everything. The baked potato salad as a side was terrific but the cole slaw was commercial and had way too much mayonnaise in it. He should get some dry cole slaw and make it himself. That is what held it back from a 3 to a 4 star joint"}
{"text":"Absolutely WILL NOT consider ordering from here ever again!

Not only did the blatantly disregard my request for no Dijon mayo, I would guess they doubled up the typical portion completely ruining my entire sandwich. There is not a single piece of meat not covered in it! 

This is also the WORST mac 'n cheese I have had in my entire life. 

On top of all of that, they don't even answer the phone when you call with an issue. 

Worst food and customer service I have experienced in the entire greater Cleveland area!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, but not terrible. It's a small place to cook, so it seems like most things are kept in warming trays or racks. Okay for a small lunch portion, but I wouldn't consider it for dinner."}
{"text":"This was me and my fiancée's first time here. It was good but not extraordinary. We got the brisket sandwich and the taster platter.

Definitely a three star!"}
{"text":"The red umbrellas caught my attention turning  off of 117th. St. Delioucious brisket BBQ sandwich hit the spot.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Briskett was pretty good. Sort of like roast beef though. Ice cream was standard. Sides were very small."}
{"text":"i'm pretty stuffed right now.  the guy that took my order recommended the Porky Pig.  It was delicious.  next time I might ask for a little more bbg sauce on the side, but when I get pulled pork, I do really like when it is not saturated with sauce to begin with.  I got the baked beans as a side - I loved that there were like 3 or 4 types of beans!  overall, I loved the gorilla.  I'm thrilled that it is in Lakewood and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Gorilla has the charm of a roadside ice cream shop combined with the chops of a solid bbq joint. Two window operation (one for ordering, one for pick-up) with a few tables outside to enjoy the weather. Menu is a bunch of comfort foods with ice cream shakes, hot dogs and meaty sandwiches. 

I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich, which comes with two sides for just $9. I got sides of maple cornbread and bacon potato salad. The maple cornbread was real tasty and made me wanna go 'ooo ooo aww aww' like a real Gorilla. It had a good balance of sweet and savory flavor, tasting like a well buttered pancake soaked in just the right amount of maple syrup so as to impart the flavor but not ruin the texture. The potato salad with bacon bits drizzled on top, while predictable in flavor, was a tasty and solid side.

The brisket sandwich has an appropriate amount of meat, leaving you satisfied but not over-full. Usually when I eat bbq, I feel gross afterwards, have a bout of the itis and must nap before I can be productive. The bbq brisket here is manageable serving size, flavorful and holds well upon multiple bites. The french roll proves to be a durable vessel for the brisket and soaks in many of the brisket juices. 

Will be back again to The Gorilla this summer."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice this week and was treated horribly by the girl with the short blond hair both times!!  Extremely rude!!!! I will never go back! First time I got the brisket and complimented how good it was...she looked at me then looked away. Sent time I got an ice cream cone and it was lop sided and falling off the cone. Instead of automaticity making another she said....can I give you a bowl? I kindly asked can you try another one...she was horrible and rolled her eyes. Horrible customer service. Oh when I got the brisket the first time I asked for Carolina on the side and she gave me honey mustard. They were not busy at all and I believe she did it on purpose. I will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I understand Proper Pig has more publicity than this place, but The Gorilla was in Lakewood/West Cleveland first and I would prefer eating here than there. I had there Carolina sandwich and tried a bit of my husband's sample platter (ribs, pulled pork, brisket, baked beans) and everything was sweet, juicy, and downright delicious. They make their own BBQ sauce and it's tasty. Plus, the prices are super reasonable (both of our meals were $7 each). I liked that chef uses different beans in his baked beans but they were little bit too liquidy. They tasted great, I just wanted them to be more condensed. Finally, they also have a cute tropical area for patio seating and of course you have to take a photo with the giant gorilla. This is a great place to have a chill, no fuss meal by yourself, as a casual date and even as a group and family."}
{"text":"Great BBQ for the price.  Excellent pulled pork, ribs, and brisket. Good smoke flavor and the house BBQ sauce complimented it well.  Can't go wrong with soft-serve treats.  I will be back many times this Summer!  Great job Chef Jim!!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ.  I got brisket on a toasted roll and it was very filling, pretty much to the point where I ditched the roll and just ate the meat.  I would like to see some more things on the menu like mac and cheese, I fee like that holds well for a business that does BBQ.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What a fun little place! It feels like a little ice cream stand in the south, with lots of trees and plants, and of course, a giant gorilla statue. 

It does, in fact, have ice cream and milkshakes. And then you can build your own hot dog or get one of the recommended combos. I got the one with teriyaki, mango salsa, and green onions. Sweet and good! 

I've heard the bbq is out of this world, but it was closed because we went on a holiday, so we will be back to try it out. 

There's a few picnic tables outside, but no indoor seating, so keep that in mind if the weather isn't great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed today when we drove a considerable distance to try this place and found it all closed up for the winter. After driving home I visited the Facebook page to learn it will open again in April. Yelp, you failed us on this one. The Gorilla is most certainly NOT open today! (although I read that catering, etc. can still be had.)
My 3 star rating is given solely on the yummy pictures on the menu . . . wish we could have tried the food!"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of hype for this place.  I do not see where it comes from...  I have been waiting for a good bbq place in Lakewood and much like the failed somethins smokin, Gorilla leaves me disappointed.  The service was awful, no one knew what was going on and I was constantly asked if I would like to order after I ordered.  I had to go back three times for missing food.  Then the food, the hotdogs are worse than gas station hotdogs and priced twice as much.  The bbq sliders are priced as if they were fancy and good, yet there is little bbq to this other than the sauce, which is very little, that was applied to a sorry excuse for meat.  Also parting words of wisdom, choosing to make what little soace they have into parking spots is a bad decision.  Kids running around while idiots zoom in and out is a recipee for disaster.  I dont see this place making it to next year.  I will wait once again for something other than famous daves to put out something better than average bbq."}
{"text":"Got some BBQ here once a couple years ago and it was good, but nothing remarkable. Though with my most recent experience, I doubt I'll be back. We saw they just went on Uber Eats, so we ordered some dinner. I was just getting a snack: medium waffle fries ($5) with cheese sauce ($1.50) and a small King Gorilla ice cream with cookie dough ($4.65). Fries arrived with no cheese sauce (which was the only reason I got them). Even that isn't a big deal, as I can get that refunded. But I don't know where they get off charging $5 for generic frozen waffle fries. The order was about 10 fries. Absolutely nothing remarkable. I could have gotten an entire bag of probably the same fries at the store for less money. Then the King Gorilla contained almost no cookie dough and the ice cream tasted like plastic. Couldn't even eat it. Giving it two stars because of one decent meal 2 years ago. Very unimpressed and totally ruined our dinner for the evening..."}
{"text":"This is a quintessential Lakewood business. Only in Lakewood, Ohio could a place with such a weird name and bizarre Gorilla sculpture exist and make complete sense. The Gorilla occupies the former Ice Cream stand called Sugar Bear's. When I was a kid a man was murdered in cold blood across the street while using a pay phone outside of what is now The Flying Rib. That man was Vincent Drost. RIP to Vincent Drost. A gorilla statue now stands guard as the ambassador of Bird Town. The standout of this small stand is the BBQ. My father and I shared the brisket, pulled pork and turkey. All were outstanding with the tell tale red smoke rings signifying to the eater that the chef has mastered their craft. The sandwiches are outstanding and a great value for $5. The smoked meat is also available by the pound in bulk. Great to see more businesses opening up in Bird Town."}
