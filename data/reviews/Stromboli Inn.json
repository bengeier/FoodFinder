{"text":"Totally stumbled on this quaint little place and loved it. The pizzas are deep dish but not heavy. Service is friendly. And you can taste the love in the food. My son said his pizza was a party in his mouth. Will need to come again when next we visit Calgary."}
{"text":"Was our first time and what a Nice all round experience.  Service was really and and our pizza was amazing. Will defiantly be returning in the near future .."}
{"text":"Great to have this back with the same bread crust pizza as the old Kensington location."}
{"text":"Stromboli is one of my favourites. Peter's recipe has been honed and perfected over generations. You won't find many places anywhere with such amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I don't know how they get the crust so high and yet so thin. My new favorite pizza place in town.  The service was excellent.  I didn't even mind they don't have their liquor license yet. With pizza this good it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise after finding good reviews on Yelp. Amazingly delicious, light for my first deep dish pizza and the crust texture and flavors were divine. Lots of care and love in the ingredients and preparation. The kind of place you DO go out of your way to visit again! Nothing else like it, SO good, friendly service and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm writing this review feeling fat and satisfied on incredible pizza and red wine. It's a really good feeling, and if you want to feel it too, I'd highly recommend you give Stromboli Inn a try sooner rather than later.  It's located in a charmingly small century(ish) bungalow in Bridgeland, so right off the bat it's winning some serious notches on the adorable scale. The interior is the same size as the dining and living rooms would be in a small bungalow, seating about four tables, or 16(ish) people. While the inside has a nice and intimate, yet family style feel with all the photos on the walls, I'd highly recommend grabbing a spot on the exceptionally cute covered patio. It's off the Main Street in Bridgeland, so it's a nice quiet place in the jars of the city to eat some tasty Italian 'za' as the sun goes down."}
{"text":"When I heard that the old Stromboli Inn is resurrected in my neighbourhood of Bridgeland, I kinda got excited.  Afterall, a good pizzaria is an integral part of any good neighbourhood.  Stromboli Inn is located next to Villa Firenze in a small house on the same property.  There's a family connection between the two businesses.  The place is very small with only four tables and a few extra chairs by the door where you can wait if you choose to take out.  We ordered the 'Giuseppe', their house special at $23 for the 12 inch or you can have an 8 inch for $19.  The pizza took a long time to make, nearly 40 minutes.  If you're waiting for a take-out, you can always head across the street to Luke's Drugstore and grab a coffee and check out their vinyl selection.  It'll beat sitting by the door as the place filled up while we were waiting and it got quite hot and stuffy fast.  Carrying it home, the pizza felt quite hefty.  In fact, at first glance, it reminded me of the old Karouso's pizza with that thick outer crust.  The Giuseppe had pepperoni, salami, bacon, mushrooms, baby shrimp, anchovies, and green peppers.  Though not a fan of baby shrimp or green peppers, the shrimp in this case was nicely seasoned and the peppers had a nice texture which, in the end, give the pizza an added dimension.  The crust, which is thicker than the neapolitan style that's in vogue now, is surprisingly light and airy, even the outer crust.  Personally, I would've prefered a little more sauce and cheese.  But all-in-all, not a bad pie and definitely a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"For the love of pizza!! My friend kept telling me how good the pizza was here and that I had to try it. So the other week I was sick and it was a bad day at work.... played up a sympathy card big time and I told him that he had to bring me pizza.  Feeling love not only by my buddy's generosity but feeling the love for delicious pizza that was taking away all my worries of the world, one bite at a time.  I hate to admit that He was right, the pizza from here is actually really good! It's kind of got the perfect crust to cheese and stuffing ratio.  Hopefully next time I'm a little bit more perky and I get to dine in, maybe enjoy the environment and a glass of red wine."}
{"text":"We decided to check out the re-opened Stromboli Inn and we are very glad we did. It is much smaller (five tables) and the menu is short,  but the pizza is just as we remembered it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Driving by this place I thought it looked kinda neat and my husband recognized the name as being a good pizza place. Being the pizza fanatic that I am, I just had to try it and I had to try it right away.  My search for the next best pizza is never-ending. I was not disappointed in the least. The restaurant itself has nice cozy, relaxed little setup. There are about 5 tables inside and another 4 tables on the patio. We decided to sit on the patio and it was a very nice and relaxing atmosphere. I'm not entirely sure I would want to sit inside as its pretty cramped and no music or anything so I would feel like everyone would be listening to my conversation. But the patio was very lovely. The service was quick and pleasant without being over bearing. 5 stars for service. The menu was somewhat limited and just consisted of pizza. But if you do pizza as well as they do you don't really need to serve anything else. The only thing I would have like to seen is a little more extensive beer and wine menu. The beer selection was very limited and there was nothing on tap, only bottles.   And then the pizza came. If this review was based solely on the pizza it would be a 5 star without question. Absolutely phenomenal pizza. We chose the 12 inch Forcella pizza to split between the 2 of us and it was more than enough. The stromboli spicy italian sausage on this pizza was to die for, really added something to the pizza. But it was the crust that really took this pizza to another level. Very light and almost crispy, but yet thick at the same time without being heavy or dense. SOOOO good. You just have to try it for yourself.  I will definitely be back for this pizza. I'm not sure if I would eat in here very often but without a doubt will be ordering this pizza again as takeout."}
{"text":"Stromboli has been an institution in Calgary for decades.  Their pizza remains a personal all time favourite. The quality of the dough and freshness of ingredients remain.  Such a beautiful dining experience.  The premises allow for an intimate dining meal.  The staff are exceptional in their attention to customer service.   A pleasurable experience only made better with exceptional food.  Make this an experience you will not forget."}
