{"text":"I LOVE this hibachi place! The food is awesome every time.  I always get the hibachi chicken with broccoli. The woman who takes your order always remembers my order. She is also very sweet! Very inexpensive and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and does not taste like hibachi, but instead, chicken and broccoli that Chinese restaurants have with light sauce. Also, they FILL your plate with rice and only offer a little protein. Not my favorite hibachi spot but It isn't terrible either."}
{"text":"Food overall was good. Price was really good. I was disappointed with the \"sweet\" carrots that really just tasted like canned carrots. The server was nice and offered us extra plates for the kids."}
{"text":"Eh, just ok.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order boring food served by equally disinterested employees.   Next."}
{"text":"If you feel like reading my review of Benihana or any of my reviews for that matter, you'll find out that 1. Hibachi has not been my friend lately 2.  I'm not afraid to be honest - for better or worse 3. I have yet to give any business 5 stars.  Well, Hibachi Express - it's your lucky day.    It was a Hibachi-kinda night.  Rainy, dark, cold - nothing a little \"sizzle\" couldn't help.  My bestie picked up dinner and brought it over for an exciting even of \"Modern Family.\"  The total for my plate of wonderfulness was $8.50.  Eat that, Benihana.  I was expecting...well, not much.  But I was PLEASANTLY surprised.  The side of \"sweet\" carrots, as described on the menu, could not have been any sweeter and were nestled in their cute individual section of the totally reusable (who needs Rubbermaid?) container.  The veggie portion that I opted for in lieu of rice was plentiful, fresh and very, very delicious.  And the shrimp?  Not exactly \"jumbo,\" but high quality and grilled to perfection.  Seriously.  I could eat here every day.  China Lin, I shall miss you, but will always think of you fondly.  Wei Wei, it was a short, but nice run - though I probably won't see you again.  Unless Hibachi Express closes its doors, I will be barreling through them at least once a week in an excited haze of Hibachi happiness.  Join me?"}
{"text":"It's okay. Nothing special. I order the chicken Hibatchi large. It's a big portion probably would have wanted the regular size but wasn't given the option when I places the pick up order. The food was at first good but after awhile it was extremely salty even the vegetables. I wouldn't crave this place, still on the hunt for good Hibatchi."}
{"text":"My favorite quick hibachi place in Charlotte! Food is delicious & addicting. Also the best prices for a big portion- $6.25 for hibachi chicken, fried rice, broccoli, mushrooms, sweet carrots and a large sized white/shrimp sauce. At first I was hesitant-- completely empty, no ac or TVs/Music (so definitely take out instead of dining in, although they do have a patio outside). But now I won't go anywhere else. I hope this restaurant sticks around."}
{"text":"My bf and I LOVE this place! It has now become my go-to place for healthy, quick and affordable meals in my neighborhood!  No more Subway! :)   I have eaten in and gotten take out, and on all occasions the staff is so nice and accommodating! Especially if you eat in, the one lady behind the counter kept coming to our table to check on our food.   I love this place and can't wait to order from there again very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I give two stars and see the description \"Meh. I've experienced better,\" I think - Meh, I've experienced better.    I was starving when I got here so I felt like anything would just be lovely.  I can't go so far as to say lovely but it was adequate.  I ordered crab rangoons, and teryaki chicken.  The crab rangoons were good, not great and the side sauce was too thick, almost gelatinous.  The chicken teryaki was served with broccoli, brown rice, sweet carrot slices and shrimp sauce.  The teryaki sauce did not taste like teryaki.  It was almost a mix between brown sauce, and teryaki - not a good mix.  The chicken was not tender, but not chewy (just MEH!).  Overall, not impressed.  However, I did really enjoy their self serve Pepsi fountain.  I'm a Diet Pepsi addict so this was just a wonderful feature.    On the plus side, the girl behind the counter was very sweet.  Instead of just calling our order out, she made sure to deliver it to our table, and thanked us for coming in on the way out!"}
{"text":"To be quite honest, I was a little sketched out by this place. No one was really in there, & my boyfriend & I were going to stop in for some dinner because hello? Japanese food is awesome. But it can be a complete nightmare if it's not prepared right.  These people that are behind the hibachi are absolutely amazing. I don't know what they did to my teriyaki chicken & broccoli, but oh my GOODNESS. It was so good. I wasn't all that hungry & I absolutely killed my food. I loved how tasty it was. Don't let the looks deceive you because dang it's good.   I'm really glad that I didn't let the looks of this place turn me off, & not go. My only gripe would be is that the floors are a little dirty, but to be honest, my feet are just touching it. Not my food.   Very inexpensive. They give you a lot of food for what you pay for. I got the medium chicken teriyaki broccoli with fried rice & sweet carrots & it was only 6.95! Very happy with this place. Will definitely return in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to town.  This place did not disappoint.  Super fast, delicious, and fresh!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food at 945 told it would be ready by 1016. As I was driving the lady called me twice but I didn't answer cause I was driving. I missed the turn because they had turned all their lights off so I was pulling up closer to 1025, mind you they close at 1030. I pick up my phone to let them know I was pulling up and sorry I was a few minutes behind she starts yelling that they are closed and they have no fried rice for me. As I tried to explain I'm right outside she just continued to yell on the phone. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the prices are really great!! They have a variety of things and the hibachi is great!!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Bloomfield area. Roomy, clean interior. Service was prompt. Food was pretty good and tasted fresh, and the prices were reasonable. The sweet carrots side is surprisingly tasty. I really wish they had sushi though! Also the restroom strangely does not have a lock on the door..."}
{"text":"I kept walking past it, didn't think it would be good. Never saw people in there. I WAS MISTAKEN!!! Very good food cook fresh! The lady is very nice remember my order every time"}
{"text":"Don't let the fast-food style facade fool you. The food definitely comes out quickly, but it's made-to-order and they have some damn tasty udon noodles! I don't usually do hibachi at the big restaurants (Nakama, Benihana, etc) because they always seem big on flair and small on taste (and value for that matter). I'm actually looking forward to trying the hibachi offerings here though.  Definitely agree with Morgan, this place is a great addition to Bloomfield. Give them your money if you're in the mood for something fast, fresh, delicious and different!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. It's closer to me than other Japanese restaurants and cheaper. All I have to say is - drive the extra mile and pay the extra few bucks!   I'm no Japanese food connoisseur, but I've probably been to about 10 Hibachi restaurants and 5 express Hibachi restaurants and I don't even think I would call this Japanese food. They had a mix of Chinese, Japanese, and the mall-type \"bourbon chicken\" they are always offering you free samples of.  Maybe they should stick to one type of food and try to perfect it before venturing out.  I had the teriyaki shrimp with fried rice and mixed veggies, and a side of shrimp sauce and ginger sauce. The fried rice was just plain white rice with a little soy sauce and eggs mixed in - very bland. But the real disappointment was the sauces. The white sauce was literally Pepto Bismol pink (usually it's a little orangey/salmon color) and tasted NOTHING like any other white sauce I've ever had. Same with the ginger and teriyaki sauces. I don't know what they made them with, but it sure didn't taste like any ginger or teriyaki sauce I've ever had. I tried to just brush all the sauce off and eat the shrimp and veggies plain, but that didn't really work too well since it was cooked in the sauce.  One good point, the people seemed nice and gave me free egg drop soup which was pretty good. I feel bad for them, but it just wasn't good. Apparently I'm not the only one because the place was empty. I recommend Yoshi's Hibachi Grill which is in the shopping center on the corner of WT Harris and Tryon instead."}
