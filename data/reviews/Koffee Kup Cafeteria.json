{"text":"I love, love, love this place! The price is right and the food is always fresh and absolutely delicious! Every time I dine there, the staff is very friendly. It's hard to find restaurants with staff that always offers service with a smile these days. That alone is worth coming back for. I highly recommend Koffee Kup Cafeteria and I will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Awesome & great tasting food, extremely long lines at times but it's worth the wait, I love their deserts, especially the homemade banana pudding"}
{"text":"I came here for a bridal shower. We were in a separate place from the actually restaurant. But the restaurant layout is pretty cool. And I was pleasantly surprised by size of the space. 

We were served chicken wings, green beans, mac and cheese, pasta salad and some of the BEST lemonade I've ever had! All the food was delicious and very well seasoned! And the staff were all so nice! I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try! 

Oh....They have a Sunday brunch!  I can't wait to come back for that."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!!! Collard greens and potato salad are phenomenal!! Don't get me wrong everything I've had is delicious!! Everyone has a smile on there face!! Ms Brenda and the owner are the best with their southern sweet charm!!  Definitely will become a regular!!"}
{"text":"Working for a couple of days next door I visited Koffee Kup for lunch twice, the first time I had the meatloaf which I thought was pretty run of the mill the second time the wing plate and that was by far the winner. Huge wings paired with great mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and a sweet tea and now we have a meal. Its true cafeteria style soul food cooking and its very affordable. Not everything on the menu is great but one thing that is divine is the peach cobbler, save yourself some room for it if you can."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and hit them up right before they closed on a Saturday. I must say the meal was delicious, I got the 3 wing dinner with 2 sides and peach cobbler to go. I liked the selection of sides that they had and the prices. I will be back."}
{"text":"We visited on Easter Sunday, although they did not have the Easter ham, everything else was fresh, well seasoned and generous portions
Inviting and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Close to my hose and they are always so friendly!! Love you guys keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was delicious. Half and half lemonade/tea was a great combination. Not over powering of sweet. Just the right amount. Walking in and getting in line made me remember the days of being a kid. Elementary take was a nice touch. Truly nostalgic."}
{"text":"Southern Cooking, yum. This place was so big inside, and the staff was so friendly. Next time we return to Charlotte, we'll come back."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing place!  Excellent staff that was able to accommodate my party of 15 after my wife's college graduation the day of. Food was perfect!  I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"While browsing through Yelp I was on the prowl for some comfort food!! CamE across this little gem. The southern hospitality they offer here is beautiful!! Now let's get to the good stuff! I was so indecisive I couldn't just leave with one thing. I ordered the wing dinner with Mac and cheese, collards, and yams. Everything was good. The chicken breading was a little soggy which I didn't like its like the grease was old or they didn't cook them long enough, the Mac and cheese was good just needed a little salt and pepper, the yams were on point and the collards were good, cornbread was bland. The banana pudding was homemade and really good. I ate it all before I got to get to a picture. Sorry guys! Overall everything was good service gets 5 stars and food gets 3 1/2 I'd love to come back and try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, but it won't be the last. I am really picky about my mac and cheese, but theirs looked good so I decided to try it. They didn't disappoint, it was so good. The food is seasoned well and the staff was friendly. I would recommend this to anyone that's in the mood for some good home cooking."}
{"text":"Where do I start.... great food selection, great flavor, and great staff. This place has the best mac and cheese around! The fried chicken is juicy and flavorful.  I usually get the smothered pork chop or beef ribs (back). They offer great desserts like grandma's banana pudding (the real stuff and not that crap made from Jello pudding). I will return again and again. Best place this close to uptown - Merts just has a great location."}
