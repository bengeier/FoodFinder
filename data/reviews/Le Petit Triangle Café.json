{"text":"Nice brunch choice in Cleveland.  Tried the meatball appetizer, sautéed mushroom crepe, chocolate lover crepe, omelette and the smoke salmon platter, really good!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day and was thoroughly impressed.  It is definitely a place that will require a couple more visits just to get through the must-have list of dishes.  The smoked trout appetizer was great and the ham on challah with egg was straight up naughty.  The one hitch was that it was cold outside and when the door opened, our table 5 feet from it, was blasted with a Cleveland gust of winter."}
{"text":"Le Petit Triangle's got that casual french vibe down. I love the fresh and authentic ingredients they use to make delicious crepes and sandwiches.   Brunch time on the weekends can be a bit crowded, so prepare to wait if you're craving a crepe.  In the summer they have a few bistro-style tables on the front patio for your people-watching pleasure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Cleveland- it really does feel like a whole in the whole Parisian bistro. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and all are marvelous. The Niçoise salad is incredible and their crepes are some of the best I've ever had. Call ahead to snag a table if you can, it's a tiny restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Le Petit Triangle the night before Valentine's Day in what otherwise was a great night out.  While I would hope our experience would not be replicated across the many typical nights it is open, it is worth documenting in case others have had similar experiences.  We were seated just inside the front door so that two small tables in the window were behind us.  The two couples at these tables (we soon learned) were actually together and well known by the wait staff.  The foursome was loud, crude (uncountable f-bombs and other profanity laced most of their conversation), etc.  They shouted comments and orders to the wait staff, who shouted back or came over and became involved table side in the loud conversation.  A restaurant can't control the poor behavior of its patrons, but the staff can temper it instead of perpetuating it.    Our meal started off well enough food wise.  The pâté was excellent and the onion soup hit the spot on a snowy night although the onions could have been carmelized better.  We ordered out entrees, another glass of wine, and then the wait began.  Some time passed as we slowly nursed our wine we intended to drink with our entrees.  After a long while when our glasses were near empty the waiter dropped the check....but we hadn't had our dinner.  He was embarrassed we didn't receive our food and somehow thought someone else should have brought it to us.  It was pretty clear they were cleaning up for the night so out wait for resubmitted order was long.  The guy behind the triangle counter tossed metal objects into the sink by the window (boom!) and finally the food came.  The Beef Bourguignon was pretty darn good.  The strip steak was warm and medium well instead of medium (probably sat as the other dish was being completed).  These were comped but that isn't the point.  Our waiter barely spoke to us as he dropped the check again and took our card.  I still don't know why my wife left a decent tip (on the undiscounted total).    And the loud table made fun of my classic fur hat as I left.    Very classy indeed."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Cleveland and found this gem. It seems like a reservation would be a good idea on the weekends, but they were about to squeeze us in and I'm so glad! All the food was really delicious. Very cute and a welcome comfort on the road."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe! Very quaint and cozy. The food was delicious!!! Want to go back to try other things on the menu. I ordered a chèvre strawberry crepe with a side of roasted potatoes and vegetables and it was all to die for. The crepe was soft and creamy and the roasted potatoes were perfectly flaky. Will be going back very soon for more -- can't wait to try their croissant and espresso"}
{"text":"Visited LPT on Saturday evening with some friends -- I've been meaning to get here for awhile since I was a fan back when this place was in \"Le Oui Oui Cafe\" and love that now it has a name that I can still say with a trace of a (bad) French accent, but without the embarassment from feeling like you were saying Wee-Wee...I digress...  Anyway, this place has been lightened up in its reinvention -- still very small and charming but now even cozier. Along with a more robust menu, featuring breakfast all day (winner!), there is a great cocktail menu (anything that features St. Germain AND champagne wins my heart) as well as a very decent wine and beer selection.   I went with the classic Croque Monsieur after the table shared a cheese plate -- fromage was delish -- it didn't disappoint. All the food in general was delish, filled with the buttery goodness and awesome bread that should be the standard for French bistro plate. I think that my friend's dish of the french equivalent of gnocci was a bit underwhelming (can't recall the name), but other than that, rave reviews all around.   Finally -- and I can't believe I've buried the lead here -- the dessert crepes were heavenly. Had a dark chocolate, salted caramel, almond creation that was divine. A bite of my friend's nutella & strawberry crepe was also amazing. Definitely save room for dessert. And, after passing fresh out-of-the-oven quiches upon our exit, I will be back soon to try those...if you're in this neighborhood, definitely give this charming place a try!"}
{"text":"Crepes were divine. Croque Monsieur even better - we all shared to spread the tasty noms around!"}
{"text":"The people here, and the atmosphere, are wonderful. The food is simple and good. And very reasonably priced. Excellent cocktails. My favorite place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The service is reprehensible and obscenely delayed. There is no concept of the commonly accepted idea among restaurants that the customer is always right. And after the delay, they have the nerve to rush your order and service. In one phrase: One BIG MISTAKE"}
{"text":"Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find Sunday brunch in Cleveland? I'm sure everyone who lives here has a go-to spot, but if you're in town for a night and staying downtown, you may be having coffee and a scone at the one place you find open. Unless you are willing to walk - and I am. And it's a good thing too, because this brunch was wonderful. I had roasted vegetable crepes with bechamel, a couscous salad, and a bloody mary, and the fella had one of the many variations of the croque-monsior. Now, this place is tiny. Very tiny. There's one server and one cook. Tiny. But we had great service, great food, and a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was fabulous and inexpensive.  We had the quiche and the chicken cheddar crepe with peach chutney.  Good variety on the menu and nice selection of drinks.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a decent Cleveland interpretation of a French cafe. The menu is populated with a number of traditional French dishes that you would expect (escargot, cassoulet, croque madame/monsieur, pate, french cheeses, etc) along with some interesting crepes. The prices are low and the service is adequate. The building is sort of a hole in the wall in Ohio City, nothing to write home about. the food didn't blow me out of the water but I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for brunch several times and always enjoyed it, but a recent dinner there with my family was very disappointing. The service was slow and our waiter was unfriendly. I ordered the lentils and smoked trout salad and crouque provencal. When our food finally came he brought only the crouque. When I reminded him I'd ordered a salad he didn't apologize for the error, and by the time the salad arrived (brought by another staff member) I'd nearly finished the crouque. Meanwhile, my wife had ordered a glass of wine with her boeuf bourguignon, but had to request it three times before it finally arrived, brought by the hostess. She did at least apologize, and didn't charge us for it. The food was good, but not enough to make up for the poor quality of the service. I won't be in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for any meal of the day - I get something different every time and have never been disappointed. Bring an appetite and friends from out of town - Keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazingly great and not expensive.  Although quite small it has that romantic feeling. Wanted the Pork shoulder but they sold out so got the steak Boursin ... Great"}
{"text":"Cute little French Cafe. Great Service, Friendly Staff, Delicious Crepes, Coffee and Egg Dishes!"}
{"text":"We've now been coming here for years and it only continues to get better. This is hands down one if the best restaurants in all of cleveland. The food is always spectacular; favorites include the duck, pate, cheese plates and escargot. You cannot get a better crepe in this city either. The setting is reminiscent of a small french cafe and they capture this beautifully. For those complaining about the service, this is not one if those places you dine quickly at. You are meant to eat slowly, drink wine and enjoy yourself and appreciate the food and company. The part of the charm of this place is that of a french cafe, not a quick dining experience by any means.  This is one of Cleveland's absolute gems and I'll keep coming back as long as long as I can. Don't change a thing, this is the most unique and lovely experience in the entire city!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Tremont when I was struck with a desperate craving for anything chocolate, and decided to stop by Le Petit Triange Cafe, which I had heard about for a while but never tried. Once I saw the dessert crepe menu, I was sold. At first, I couldn't decide between the chocolate crepe with the option of nutella or French dark chocolate and a variety of fillings (nuts, bananas, etc.) or the peanut butter crepe with banana and the option of French dark chocolate. They sounded the same, and they basically are, so I went with the peanut butter crepe + French dark chocolate (duh). It was really, really good, and I ended up coming back two days later to get it again.  My friend got an entree crepe (mushroom and cheese, I believe) and tried the apple dessert crepe. She loved her entree but was disappointed in her dessert (she said it was bland) and didn't end up finishing it. She tasted my peanut butter crepe and agreed that it was delicious, and ordered it the next time we were there.  I expected Le Petit Triangle Cafe to be charming--the atmosphere and casually sophisticated waiters don't disappoint--but I didn't expect them to have a nice happy hour menu, which they do. Beer, wine, and a selection of appetizers (the cheese plate stands out in my mind) are all discounted, which makes the already reasonably priced menu even better for those who want to sample a little bit of everything. I'll definitely be back, if only to sit on their sidewalk and pretend to be French all through the summer."}
{"text":"The best place for savory and sweet crepes in Cleveland. This corner restaurant feels like it could almost fit right in on a Parisian street. This place is high on our list of great brunch places."}
{"text":"Best brunch, ordered the croquet Madame! Menu was hard to choose from because if all the great choices!"}
{"text":"I love it! It has a great intimate French bistro feeling, and wonderful food as well. The service was a little slow, but the food and drinks made up for it. I'd definitely recommend it for a good brunch spot."}
{"text":"This is my first review. Just had to do it after going to le petit triangle. Food was incredible; all the ingredients tasted fresh; service was great. Ham and cheese omelette was to die for, and the chocolate crepe was a tasty dessert. I absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love French cafes - this place was perfect.  Cute and quaint with great bellinis.  Food was delicious too!"}
{"text":"A nice little spot to have a great meal. I would agree with others that the french onion soup lacked flavor but everything else was very good. I tried two different crepes (flour not buckwheat) and they were both good. Street parking was fine and the neighborhood was interesting."}
{"text":"I walked into Le Petit Triangle on a cold rainy day just hoping to dry off off and warm up a bit while killing a little time. I was immediately greeted (almost overwhelmingly) by a few employees who were eager to attend to my requests. I just came in for a black coffee, and was given a great cup and copious refills (before I even thought to ask for another!). I spent over an hour in there keeping to myself but the short time I spent in the café brightened not just my dreary afternoon, not just my drab day, but my entire week thusfar. The music (bossa nova, a personal favorite that I hear sadly too little in classy lounge settings) made my heart flutter in joy and the charming aesthetic of Le Petit took me on a pleasant journey down nostalgia lane. I lament that I am in Ohio City so little; I quite nearly feel guilty that I cannot patronize this establishment more often because within minutes of entering it became one of my favorite locations in the world, period. Quaint, quiet, elegant setting is perfect for cracking open a book and meditating over a delightfully steaming cup of joe. I didn't get any food, but I have no reservations that it too would be superb."}
{"text":"The blue cheese and mushroom crepe and French press coffee are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful breakfast at this intimate French cafe.  Stuffed French toast and smoked salmon omelette are my current favorites.  Be sure to make a reservation for Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service was just right, selection outstanding, food very very good.  Traditional French cuisine without being stuffy or overpriced.  Gluten free friendly for sure.  You can even get the crepes gluten free and they are delicious (buckwheat flour).  The deserts are very good, a decent wine selection and full bar. Only complaint in that the seating in the front by the window on a 90° day was a bit warm but I was warned so it was entirely my fault.  Staff could not have been more friendly or knowledgeable about their food.  Go here.  Go here for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I was immediately charmed by Le Petite - it's a very cozy (read: small) cafe with an open kitchen and lovely patio.  The service is warm and friendly. The atmosphere feels very authentic and the menu is divine.  My friends and I had a hard time choosing what to order.  The best parts were the drinks - fernet and espresso (from local roasters Rising Star) and bellinis.  Le Petite boasts an impressive drink list - my friend is a national beverage director and he was very happy with the offerings.  We tried: cheese plate, French onion soup, and 2 savory crepes.  The food was pretty good overall.  Next time, I'm going to splurge on a croissant sandwich with eggs, jambon, and brie cheese with a side of potatoes."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Excellent atmosphere. Daily quiche and roasted potatoes were excellent. Bloody Mary was a little bland. French press coffee and service were good. Several vegetarian options also available. Overall, this is a decent breakfast/ brunch choice. It won't blow you away, but it's very solid."}
{"text":"Bells two hearted IPA + cheese plate+ salmon crepe =   Best. Food. Ever.   It's not often Cleveland gets a truly fantastic restaurant that gives 5 star quality for 3 star prices.    That's why the place is always busy.    Cheese plate is has excellent portions, and is very high quality.    For dinner I always have the salmon crepe. I have ventured off a little but always find myself going back.  My wife loves the quiche.    Dessert crepes are epic. Try them all.   It would probably be a good idea to make a reservation if you plan on going on the weekends, or if you are a party of 3 or more. Tables are limited in the petit (small) triangle cafe.   During the week there is usually no wait or a very short one."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Cleveland in 20 years. Small (but they're expanding and they have outdoor tables this summer), very reasonably priced exquisite French bistro cooking. Much better than the French restaurant in Vermilion, OH, imho. Wish I lived in their neighborhood so I could eat there more often. A bracing gaspacho and chocolate-almond crepe with salted caramel sauce to die for!"}
{"text":"I ordered veggie omelet and a café olé . The portion was huge and it was just simplify delicious. If you can sit outside on a sunny morning, it the best way to enjoy food and the pretty view of Ohio city."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's tiny, cute and very French.  The food is great, the service--not too bad.  I've been to France many times and this place fits the bill.  I have only one complaint--the bathrooms.  They are GROSS, it keeps me from going back.  Please fix them before the health department closes you down!  Oh wait, does Ohio even have a health department?  hmmmmmm I really have to buck up, put on my brave face and armed with Purell--I will go...yes, I will...I need my crepes!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place. I was visiting family here and was not familiar with the area. I happened to be walking past here and decided to stop in and was pleasantly surprised! Tasty french cuisine at a reasonable price.  The reason for 4 stars is it is a very tight fit. As others have mentioned, any time you move you feel like you have to say excuse me because of such close quarters"}
{"text":"All I can say is, Delicious! My husband and I have been here on several occasions and have yet to be disappointed!! I've tried, the crepes, the pate, the escargot, seared duck, cheese plate...etc. It's all good :-) the service is always thoughtful and top notch!! This place is a hidden cozy gem!"}
{"text":"Really excellent French food. Really good. The bacaloa was amazing. The pear salad was great. One of us had pork shank which was wonderful. My order got confused. (Ordered duck. Got beef bourignon). But the beef was exceptional. Very flavorful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Literally spent the morning in Paris. Food and atmosphere was great. I would recommend making reservations. We put our name in and came back. I ate the challah French toast, hubby had eggs and sausage! The food was incredible and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this with a group for my high school. The food tasted as authentic as a girl going to a sperm bank to experience sex. It just isn't accurate."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch place. Cosy, friendly staff, and yummy food! We loved the salmon buckwheat pancake! Wished we could still handle a sweet pancake, but portions are very big!"}
{"text":"Great crepes at affordable prices, nestled in a nice part of Ohio City."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very long wait to put in order. Will definitely be back, the food is worth them being understaffed, just will plan accordingly next time."}
{"text":"I went there and sat on their patio which is rather small but reminded me of a cafe in Paris or something. Another reason for sitting outside was that they are dog friendly, so Gino (my pup) was included in our visit! The server immediately took our wine order and asked if my dog needed water, bonus!! We ordered only wine and a cheese plate, which consisted of your choice of three cheeses accompanied by two different crackers, a baguette, strawberries,apples and dried fruits. Delish!!! The server won points by bringing Gino a ramekin filled with shredded chicken! Too cute, bring fido!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I love the quinoa salads and that iced  tea."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Wine by the glass of good size. Nice Bordeaux. Menu contains classic french dishes. One of our favorites in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Went here for a very lovely Saturday brunch and was very pleased....  The menu was extensive; it was hard to choose....  Among the highlights were the french press coffee (hard to find in CLE), the french toast stuffed with chevre, the general abundance of chevre on the menu (yum), a strictly veg french onion soup that was fabulously tasty, and the multitude of crepes.  Eventually I settled on a mushroom crepe, which was very good, but with a bit to much crepe and not enough filling (hence the 4 stars).  My mom's french onion soup was super fabulous as was the cassoulet.  I will definitely go again and will be considering upgrading those stars.  PS - Did I mention that they have a GIANT JAR OF NUTELLA?  Any place with a giant jar of nutella, has to be good.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Love the tea!!!!!  Good crepes, great for brunch.  We went there for dinner once. If was good but not anything I would rave about. Add more French pastry and skip doing dinner and you will be 100%!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to have a crush on a restaurant? If so, I have a restaurant crush on Le Petit Triangle.   I have never had a bad meal or bad service here. Quite the opposite, in fact. Everything I have every had -- including sweet and savory crepes, salads, quiches, entrees, brunch options, coffee, juice, wine, dessert -- has been fresh, flavorful and satisfying. Plus, I just love how the whole space is designed. Though it's a teeny, tiny little space, with an itty, bitty open kitchen and an adorable patio, it feels welcoming and comfortable from the second you approach it.   Whether it's breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert or any other meal, \"Petit Triangle\" is always a good answer to the question, \"where should we go?\""}
{"text":"On time for our 10:30 am Sunday reservation, we got our cold breakfast 1 hour and 10 min later.  At that point it doesn't matter what the food tastes like.  Also had to flag the waitress down for coffee, fork and check.  Obviously won't go back"}
{"text":"I go to Cleveland at least 3 times a year and I ALWAYS make sure I stop here. They have incredible food, coffee and ambiance. The cafe is a little cramped, but that's because it's in a beautiful old building and I think it just adds to the charm."}
{"text":"This tiny nook houses approximately seven tables--a combo of inviting two- and four-tops attended to by a perky orchestration of fast-paced, friendly servers who gladly decorate each table with a can't-go-wrong menu.  Le Petite serves the most délicieux crepes in Cleveland. My favorite feasting is a lick-the-plate combination of Nutella, whipped cream and strawberries. Other decadent goodness is this pleasing pairing: the grilled fromage washed down with a café au lait. It's every bit(e) worth the calories. Dijon, caramelized onions, swiss cheese and my always-requested roasted chicken decorate this substantial sandwich, which I delightfully savor as much as the au lait, a whole-milk concoction combined with Crooked River Coffee's Serious French Roast. If you ever need a slap-in-the-face jolt, just grab a cup of Crooked River's SFR. Its strong profile immediately awakens your taste buds with a stream of slightly bittersweet and mildly acidic flavors."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times now. First time we tried some of the savory crepes and weren't too impressed, they would've been good with some hot sauce. Next time we both tried sandwiches. I had the steak sirloin sandwich I think, it was delicious!! I would highly recommend it. The sweet crepes were great to share and finish off with!"}
{"text":"Lovely place as far as server and atmosphere. Loved the jazz. Menu is widely varied. However, I ordered one of the savory crepes (tomato, spinach and chevre) and it was so dry and tasteless. I brought most of it home to try and \"fix\" it.  Most French crepes have some kind of sauce and they are generally known for their rich flavor. However, the people I was with loved their gnocchi and soup. I could see the wonderful sauce on the gnocchi.  I was disappointed with my food."}
{"text":"The food quality is subpar by New York standards, and by European standards it's insanely low. Please learn how to cook and use salt and spices in your dishes. Maybe switch vendors, if you care about good reviews. Although, in this neighborhood anything looking like it's \"hipsterish\" will sell to an uneducated public. Coffee is good though, so there is that."}
{"text":"Ate here with family. I felt that their food was a bit bland. Their crepes were great however. Go here for the crepes. Maybe even just for dessert. Oh and their creme brulee was really good too."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on a cold spring afternoon. The soup was good but the rest was not good at all. I had a roast chicken croissant sandwich and the croissant was stale, the roast chicken dry and cut in thick hunks. The sandwich was dry and tasteless even with mango chutney. My daughter had the chicken, cheddar and chutney crepe with the same dry chicken as on my sandwich. She had way too much chutney and little if any cheddar. Finally my husband had the steak sandwich with a tough cut of beef with lots of fat to be removed. None of us finished our meal and we won't be going back. Shame really because the concept is good but the execution is poor."}
{"text":"What a cute little cafe!  The salads we had were fresh and bright.  They were wonderful about accommodating dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland! Every time I've been it's been delightful. So many aspects of this place are really swell, every time.   The interior is charming, with the smaller open kitchen in the original little triangle shaped cafe. It's cramped in a really charming way that doesn't feel claustrophobic. There's always music playing throughout the whole restaurant that seems just right for the atmosphere - laid back, fun, intimate. It's not immaculate - the steps down to the clean bathrooms could use repainting, the wood edges of walls and tables are clearly well loved.  It seems like servers stick around at Le Petit, I've seen several of the same faces there for a couple of years - they've been friendly and helpful every time.  When I look at the menu I usually get worried that I'm going to come away hungry, but I never do - even when there aren't any  accompaniments listed, there usually are. I don't know how to say things on the menu, but I most recently had an egg dipped veggie sandwich with small potatoes on the side, all of which was flavorful and well cooked.  Cheap is what I like. While Le Petit is not bargain basement price, their prices are very fair given the quality of food. I could imagine them charging double what they do and getting away with it - thank goodness they don't!  Cheers Le Petit Triangle!"}
{"text":"Great food. The pork and steak were very tender and tasty. Seasoned just enough to pull out the flavor of the meat. The sides were excellent too - wish I had more though... The crepes were very good- we got the chocolate and it was the perfect topper for the meal"}
{"text":"This is such an adorable little restaurant. Even more importantly - the food is good!! The croque Monsieur is delicious, as is the French toast. If you go for something savory, definitely save room for a sweet crepe to split! I've been here several times, and have loved everything I've had. I can't wait for it to warm up so I can sit outside on their sidewalk patio!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Wonderful for a romantic dinner. Try their crêpes! Very authentic and fresh French food."}
{"text":"Appalling comments from the owner! There are plenty of other restaurants to choose that treat their customers with respect. Not even going to try the place."}
{"text":"I have been to Le Petit Triangle many many times (I live around the corner so it's easy to visit).    Very cute little French Bistro in Ohio City.  It's also very small, so if you're going during busy time (brunch and weekends) be prepared to wait.  I am always amazed at big their menu is and how small their kitchen (picture a tiny NYC apartment kitchen), yet they are still able produce pure deliciousness!   I always seem to order the same thing every time I go back...the Smoked Salmon Crepe. I love it that much. And I always order with the buckwheat flower (trying to be healthy while eating this yumminess).  Anyways, this crepe is filled with boursin (french soft cheese- kind of like a cream cheese) and salmon, served with red onions and capers.  All of these flavors go together so well. You won't be disappointed.  My boyfriend has ordered a few other things on the menu and has yet to be disappointed, but his go to is the Chicken Cheddar Chutney Crepe (chicken and cheddar with mango chutney on the side)...his favorite on a regular crepe. Personally I am not a fan of chutneys and jams and jellies, but have tasted his dish on several occasions and again, the flavors all just go together so well.    All the crepes are served with a side salad of couscous and lentils.  Normally I would not think of this type of salad as being amazing, but somehow they manage to have made it one of my favorite salads.  It's very refreshing and and you just feel healthier eating it, especially on warmer days.  I recently had the fortune of visiting Paris a few months ago and while there I found a hole in the wall crepe place that served the most delicious crepes I had ever had.  I can honestly say that Le Petite's crepes are very comparable to those I had in France.  Their food is delicious, the atmosphere is quaint and the service is friendly.  If you haven't been here, you should definitely check it out.  I will continue to go back here time and time again.  Although one of these days I promise to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Le Petit Triangle! It immediately transports you out of Ohio City and onto a little street somewhere in France or even Amsterdam. The food and wine are delectable,  the staff appropriately sweet and grumpy."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  The place has a very cool vibe and not what you would expect in Cleveland.  If you are in the Ohio City area be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"*years* of walking or driving by this place, whether it be the wee-wee or the smaller in nature triangular cafe- never ventured in.  sure, it looked neat.  but with odd hours i just couldn't find the moment where i was hungry *and* they were open at the same time.  i'd say that's the only drawback to this place. the hours.  one step in this little euro-flavored haven and i was so glad i finally had an appetite in working business hours.   on a windy, rainy cool autumn afternoon, this was the perfect spot to be.  the wind and rain may have been gusting outside, but the cozy warmth and GREAT coffee flowing was perfect while watching the leaves fall at the park across the street.  we opted for some crepes along the lines of le petit dejeuner.   craving eggs, i went with eggs, brie, and artichoke.  i've said it in another review, but i'm gonna recycle.  i mean, i have to.  i can't help it.  holy crepe.  *DELICIOUS*  my friend ordered the ham and brie, but since she had already been to the cafe, she knew what we were getting ourselves into.    a big, heaping pile of flavor.  that's what.  well, man.  that doesn't paint a pretty picture, now does it?  even if it's a compliment.  a big, heaping pile of *anything* just sounds wrong.  but whatever.  doesn't matter.  it's a lot of goodness right there.  we opted for splurging in a dessert crepe as well.  i can't resist the nutella (resistance is futile against the nutella), so as we sat and discussed men, love, and delicious food we licked the plate clean of strawberries, crepe, and chocolate.  i mean, it doesn't get more chic flick than a brunch with your girlfriends discussing our inabilities to find a situation as delicious as our nutella crepe, right?    but it really was a great way to appreciate a cooler, rainy autumn day- eating warm, delicious crepes while chatting with girlfriends, sipping coffee, and watching the leaves fall.  the service was wonderful.  attentive, helpful, and relaxed.    i will most definitely come back to the cafe.  it might even be a great place in the winter, too- hiding from that clevo wintery gust of snow sipping a tea and trying another culinary explosion of flavor.  ...that's what she said."}
{"text":"If you are craving crepes you should come get some here. They are really good. However, the breakfast items are overpriced and they lack flavor or a reason for me to choose it as a breakfast spot. Their sandwich items are just not worth the try, maybe an omelet would have been a better option but we all ordered different types of sandwiches and they were all lacking in flavor. One had a really runny egg that was pretty much raw (you could see through the egg white) so my friend had a hard time eating it. The service on a Saturday morning was really slow but it was full so I understand, however we were all just a little disappointed that we waited that long for a just ok breakfast."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and it is always great!  Food and service!  The specials are really tasty but if they don't sound good they're regular menu items - from salads to simple French entrées are great too. During busy times, call ahead for a table."}
{"text":"Mmmm. You know, I love going to a cute little place that's sort of a hole-in-the-wall. Usually I like when cafes / coffeehouses have that feel, and not restaurants so much. But I did enjoy this very much about Le Petit Triangle.  I had a Limota (very tart lemon sparkling water), a simple salad with pistachios, currants and chevre, and the quiche of the day which had mushrooms, Swiss, and roasted red peppers. All of it was quite delicious! The quiche also came with a piece of raisin-grain toast that was sweet and crunchy. Excellent! I should also mention that the quiche of the day comes with the salad, and it was only $8. There was plenty of food, but not an excessive amount, and for once in my life I really appreciated that. I finished everything but didn't feel too full.   My friend enjoyed her cassoulet a lot too, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Then again, I don't think I would ever order that in any restaurant, so it doesn't matter!  I only have two minor complaints. One, the air conditioning was not functioning too well. But we did get the table closet to the vent, so it wasn't bad. Two, the waitress brought our check right after we finished dinner, without offering dessert. I know they have crepes, so I might have indulged, but we didn't feel like pressing it because we might not have ordered it in the end. Even still, it would have been nice if we were offered dessert menus and/or given a little bit of time to relax. (it wasn't busy inside.)  Overall, I was very satisfied. Being that the quiche was so good, and based on the other reviews, I will surely make it here for brunch sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I really want to like but have never had a superb experience. I have visited twice now and both times the service was terrible. There always seems to be enough wait staff so it is hard to figure out why they seem to be disorderly with service. It took about 10 minutes just to get a glass of water. Once you get your food, no one checks on you again until you are finished. This time around the friends I was with were served cold potatoes. It was probably due to the fact that we saw our food sit on the counter for awhile while we waited for our server to finally see it and serve it to us. We almost wanted to get up and get the food ourselves. The food itself is okay but nothing that I will miss."}
{"text":"The food is very good but not amazing (had the smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese and capers). Friends had beautiful french toast and crepes. Waitstaff are slow to seat you and the space is a bit cramped. I think it's probably more European that way, haha. Come if you want a European experience in Ohio City. If you want purely amazing brunch food and less of a quirky experience, go to BonBon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cute, but the food was mediocre. Would not recommend ordering any of their omelettes because they were sub-par and not worth the price I paid."}
{"text":"Had the true feeling of a French Bistro, and dishes that live up that style.  They operate out of a small kitchen but are producing some high-quality fare and many traditional French dishes."}
{"text":"Came in town from Chicago to see our boys WIN THE WORLD SERIES! (sorry, shameless plug)  At any rate, we stayed in Olde City and this place was a block from our AirBnB. For a café, it doesn't get much better. The food was great and the place is so small and quaint. Only negative, which didn't bother us was that it might get a little loud since they pack you in pretty well.    All in all, definitely a nice place to hit for some breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I went to Le Petite Triangle last night with a friend. I chose the restaurant because I've been there for lunch a few times and really enjoyed it. The crepe was always my lunch choice. Get the crepes...yummy.   Our dinner experience wasn't as successful. The food was good, not great. I ordered the trout special and my friend ordered the duck special. Just nothing special about either dish. Both were just fine.   The weird part of the evening was the draft in the restaurant. The back door won't shut. In fact, it stays open about 2 inches. It was 20 degrees last night which made for a very uncomfortable night. The server would not allow us to move to the other room or a different table. Regarding the cold draft, he said \"it's just part of the triangle experience.\". Bizarre.   So, my recommendation is to go in the summer and order a crepe. Or just go for dessert. The experience will be much better than ours last night."}
{"text":"I wish this place was not six hours away from where I live, because I would eat here all the damn time."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Crepes in Cleveland, staff is friendly and food is amazing. Portions are large enough to satisfy hunger and prices won't overwhelm you. It's best to make reservations on the weekend in the morning as it gets crowded early."}
{"text":"Food was great. The service was OK but I see everybody was running around working hard so maybe they were short staffed. All friendly. The food was yummy. They have things for ( really yummy things) grandmother to little kids.  A lot of selection and it was so hard to only pick one dish.  I hope to go back and try the others I cannot eat."}
{"text":"After a long night out in Cleveland, I was ready for a filling, yet delicious breakfast. After some Yelping, I found this gem and was very glad I did.  The place is quite charming, and reminds me of a small French cafe. They asked if we had reservations, which we clearly did not, and the wait for inside was about 45min on a Sunday at noon. Luckily, the outdoor seating was first come first serve, and with it being such a nice day we lucked out and grabbed a spot.  My boyfriend and I ordered cappuccinos, but we were a bit overwhelmed with them since they actually came in a soup bowl - with two handles and all. It seemed to taste more like a latte since it was predominantly milk. I think I should have just gotten a coffee with a side of cream at that point.   We split a fresh pain au chocolat and that was delicious; fresh out of the oven and the chocolate was still warm inside. For my entree, I ordered the croque norvegian which was basically a croque monsieur except it came with smoked salmon on it instead of ham. This was very delicious and rather large. It came with a side of potatoes but I subbed it with fruit, and was really impressed with the mixed fruit array. My boyfriend got the meatball sandwich and it wasn't bad. The meatballs themselves were a little dry, but overall it was good.  I was pretty happy we found this gem in Cleveland, and it is located next to a quiet park. I liked that it wasn't exactly in a busy area, which gave it all the more charm."}
{"text":"Meh. A lot of hype, not a lot of flavor. We went here after hearing stellar reviews from several friends and the Internet. We had high expectations as we had been told how fantastic it was. Went on a Friday night, there was an hour wait. Totally expected and no big deal, walked down the street to Johnny Mangos for a drink and came back.  Our server is the sole reason for the 2 stars, and a decent appetizer. Our server was super sweet and very knowledgable of their menu and even suggested a drink for me to try. Really really nice. For an appetizer we ordered the Bruschetta. It was good, nothing special. I ordered the gnocchi, and was very excited about it. When it arrived it looked promising. However, it was BLAND. No taste whatsoever. The bf liked his meal, but didn't rave about it.  Meh should have stayed at Johhny Mangos down the street."}
{"text":"Flawless recreation of a French bistro. Unbelievably good food and drinks. The service is top notch."}
{"text":"The Petite Triangle is pretty self-explanatory. It's petite. It's a triangle. Maybe eight tables encompass an open kitchen - almost Hibachi style, but instead of flying eggs and flames, you'll see ribbons of crepe-batter poured onto hot plates. It's an obtuse dining experience (Yes, I totally just rocked a 7th grade geometry class reference) with a triple threat of savory entrees, high-end cocktails (with petite prices!), and mind-blowing desserts. Does that make it a sextuple threat?   Speaking of sex, lets talk Nutella. The biggest things inside the Petite Triangle are the gi-a-normous jars of Nutella. They're like kegs of chocolaty-hazelnut goodness hanging out at the bar, sweet enough to get giddy on. I fantasize about that stuff. It will catapult your date into bed faster than Mathew McConaughey in a Versace speedo. Wrap that up in a paper thin pancake with some fresh cut bananas, a dollup of airy whipped cream, powered sugar and a finely sliced strawberry - voila, you're a Cleveland Casanova.  Ok, so I jumped to dessert first - let's backtrack. I had always thought of The Petite Triangle as a Creperie - I. Stand. Corrected. There are soups, salads, steaks, pastas... and I haven't even touched on the extensive wine list. That tiny kitchen is like a culinary clown car - more and more and more and MORE food keeps popping out from behind it.  I had the Steak & Boursin. Boursin is a cream cheese so creamy I actually thought it was butter. Now imagine fresh baguettes slathered in the stuff with two big fat steaks lying on top. Ohhhh yeah. Let's not forget the caramelized onions and homemade Lyonnaise potatoes, all painted with a hint of oil and spice. Each dish makes its entrance with a tantalizing aroma and a happy \"ding\" from the ready bell. Then it is swept tableside by a wait staff so naturally personable, you'd think you must have known them from a previous life.  And then there's the cocktails. For examples: A brown sugar cube doused in orange bitters, fizzing at the bottom of a sweet champagne cocktail. A fresh leafy Mojito infused with a simple syrup pressed from fresh lavender petals ... and here's the best part: $5-$6."}
{"text":"I've had this cafe on my list of places to go eat at over a year, and I have to say, I came away dissapointed with my experience.   As always, let's talk service, and then food.   We went to La Petit for Brunch on a Sunday Afternoon. We reached the cafe at 12:45 pm and were promptly seated outdoors, as the indoor section \"was full and reserved\", even though we plainly saw three empty booths and not a single person walk in to occupy those over the next two hours.  15 minutes of waiting later, someone showed up with menus for us and allowed us to order coffees. The coffees took about 30 minutes to show up, and the person who delivered them was not the same person \"who could take an order\". Cue another 15 minutes - it is now 1:45 pm - our orders were taken. We ordered three relatively simple dishes - a sandwich, a bowl of soup, an omelet and a crepe. The soup was bought out after 15 minutes (2:00 pm) and then we had to wait another 40 minutes for the food.  Being seated at 12:45 pm, we were finally served food at 2:45 pm. 2 hours for brunch service. Brilliant (that was sarcasm just in case you were unsure).   All this would have been ok if we were blown away by the food, but sadly, we were not.  The onion soup ($5) lacked substance, flavor and salt.  The smoked salmon omelet was served fairly cool, with an oily (almost fried) skin and a hard dense egg interior - whatever happened to fluffy french omelets?! The crepe was thick and tasted OK at best - you can get better for cheaper in the westside market. The sandwich, I suppose, was actually good.  All in all a disappointing service with disappointing food. Not a place I will be going back to anytime soon of my own accord."}
{"text":"Great experience this time around.  I started off with a latte.  I asked for almond milk but unfortunately they didn't have any that day.  Sad :(  Very good latte.  The boy got a mocha and of course he was happy.  Sweet seeker!  I ordered a ham and brie omelet with a side of Lyonnaise potatoes.  Yum diggity.  The boy had the Croque Monsieur with salmon and an egg and potatoes.  He dug it.  Service is a little slow on a Sunday morning.  Get there before 11am or it will be packed."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to stop by for a weekend brunch! They offer a solid selection of sweet dishes and savory dishes - they've got everything from eggs to steak to crepes to waffles. And it's all absolutely delicious!   The building has a charming quality to it, though I will say the room you first come into is quite narrow - there's little room between tables and the walkways are so narrow it's impossible to walk through when a server is attending the taable. The second room is much roomier (and beautiful due to huge windows that let in gorgeous natural lighting). The service has also been great when I've gone - quick and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, definitely recommend making reservations because its small. We went for Sunday brunch- 2 of us shared an omelet (can't remember name but it was vegetarian and had tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and pesto in it- $10)-- came with breakfast potatoes. The omelette was ok-- bland but good. They also let us sub the croissant instead of toast without an extra charge. The croissant looked amazing, but was disappointing. It was hard and dry, was not very tasty either. The nutella crepe with strawberries ($7) was amazing, perfect amount of nutella and was delicious. Definitely better than the omelette. We also had mimosas, bellinis ($7 each) and a bloody mary. The drinks were good, bloody mary could have been spicier, overall it was a good experience. Good, fresh food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere. The lemon crepe is my absolute favorite item in the menu"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Ohio city. Friendly servers and great food. Make a reservation or you will have to wait over an hour. This place is extremely popular with the luxury foodie crowd."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for years and finally went for lunch. The service was ok, fairly attentive and it wasn't too busy. Unfortunately the food lacked taste. I had the onion soup and mushroom & chicken crepe, and both were very bland. I'm not opposed to another visit to try a sweet crepe but this is not the place for savory French food."}
{"text":"Absolutely charming place. The homemade lemon curd was delicious. Crepe it was on was maybe a bit  \"eggy\" for my tastes- but not enough to dock a star. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"AMAZING CROISSANTS, best in the city. It's small so expect a wait but very good brunch spot. The smoked salmon omelette is incredible!"}
{"text":"So... My review is based solely on service...  In fact... everything that I've ever eaten at this establishment has been excellent, but I couldn't turn my back on the incredibly poor behavior of one of the staffers.  The first time I went there... everything went well...  Had a bit of a wait, but was seated within the time estimate that they had given us.  The 2nd time I went, my friend arrived first and she was told an hour wait...  I went in as well when I had seen some tables clear and asked if there was a chance to be seated sooner... 2 tables were opened and the people ahead of us had been seated... but I was still told an hour after the hostess saw who I was with... So, I asked if we could do take out... We knew immediately what we wanted and was told it would still be a 20 minute wait for takeout...  So, in order to not have to wait in the crowded space for all of that time... We changed our order... We each ordered a hot beverage and she a croissant.  We were seated in the other waiting area with two other men who came in after us... Within in 10 mins they were seated... My friend and I waited 30 mins to get a warm beverage, a cold croissant, and the bill...   Now, I understand that maybe a table opened up right after, but seeing as how we had wanted to eat in the establishment and had tried several ways to get food from there... once that table had opened up, we should have been offered the space first... Perhaps a, I know you just ordered for takeout, but the seat opened, would you like it?  But no, the two men were seated... and we were still waiting for a bill on a croissant and coco...   Now the only reason I could place that we weren't seated is because my friend was not white and the two men after us were... In fact... we placed a bet that they wouldn't have to wait at all and that they would be seated very quickly... I mentioned the situation to one of the other waitresses and she immediately understood what I was trying to say to her and she tried to rectify the situation...   I didn't cause a scene in the establishment because my friend didn't want it, and it's not my place to fight for someone if they request that you not fight for them... but I refuse to stand idly by.  Marge was the hostess.  She chose not to offer us a table because she didn't want my friend there... And then, to prove a point, had us wait around for an extra 15 mins for a bill and a cold croissant... UNACCEPTABLE.  Even if race isn't involved, it was unacceptable service... NO REASON FOR US TO WAIT 15 additional minutes for a piece of paper that she could have easily produce and for that cold ass croissant.  The food there is solid... but I would never go back because of how awful they were as people.      There's no need to support that sort of negativity in this world..."}
{"text":"Loved it.....had been seeing reviews on the place and since I work failry close I decided to stop in for a bit to eat before shopping at the West Side Market. Staff was super nice and we were seated immediatley. Very trendy restaurant and one a good day you can sit outside just like if you were in France  I got the French Toast and it was done to perfection. Huge pieces of challah bread and the best French Toast Ive had in a while Topped with strawberries and whip cream as well. Now if that wants enough I got the Bananas Foster as also. Ive had Bananas Foster in the past but not the style and flair I got here. This seemed vintage french right here...bananas were fried perfectly the crepe ever so delicious.    Only reason its not a 5 star is because it was smaller than liked but maybe that adds to it it more than it takes away.   Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here! It took a little longer for the food to come out (about 30 minutes) but it was well worth the wait. The croissant was so fresh and fluffy and the potatoes were perfectly seasoned. I also got the green tea which was delicious as they infused it with orange rind."}
{"text":"Your fellow Brunch-er checking in here. I've always been a fan of La Petit even though I've only been here a few times. It's a classic for its oddly shaped restaurant and having the kitchen right next to the entrance. I enjoy how open it is (you know nothing sketchy is going in your food, na what I'm sayin?) the atmosphere is obvi french style, hence the name of the restaurant. A lot of the names of foods are in French which can be a bit confusing but the explanation underneath helps, as well as the servers that are more than knowledgeable about the menu deets. Busy but still fairly quiet which is great for having a conversation without talking over each other. Presentation of food is just as amazing as it tastes (which isn't always the case). The fresh flowers everyday on the table just helps you love this place for its ever so detailed decor. Bright colored walls with mirrors and French pictures on the them- it's just overall adorable. Certainly one of my favorite brunch spots in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of brunch places in cleveland and this is as good as it gets!  I came with 4 other people and everyone ordered something different on the menu and it was delicious.  Now you don't get a whole lot of food, but thats okay with me.  I rather eat something thats within a good portion thats tasty than a plate of huge portion thats greasy without flavor.  It's very cute, reminds me of a Cafe you would see in New York or Chicago.  I think its a cute place for brunch or a date, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Our kids took us to Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago. The atmosphere was ruined by the not so background music which was as far from French as it can be!  The food was so-so, I even forgot what I had (just looked it up on their menu and it was BACCALAHAU \"BENEDICT\" which was OK but a strange combination of potato pancakes with roasted potatoes!) but my wife had the quiche which she did not like at all.  We ordered crepes for desert and they were so-so also except for the Lemon Curd Crepe which was excellent; my wife makes much better crepes! As a side note, one of my grandsons wanted chicken wings and they did not have them! Ha! Ha! The service was very good and friendly even though it was extremely busy."}
{"text":"It's been a minute since I've been here, but I will always remember this pumpkin latte they had in the fall. It actually had REAL pumpkin in it! I had a soup as well and that was tasty. Small place, cozy and delightful."}
{"text":"I visit Petit regularly. Having lived in Paris for a couple of years, I am always nostalgic for comfort foods such as theirs. Everything from the crêpe to the niçoise to the rickety chairs and  occasional cold breeze from the front door are perfectly reminiscent of my time in Paris, being dragged by my partner into little random bistros. The service is polite, very traditional in that it is not smothering. The kitchen staff always thank me for coming in, which I appreciate. The place is small, they are busy, but they remember you and add a nice personal touch whether you eat there daily or simply once a month. Don't be afraid to try something you wouldn't usually choose. Everything is well-executed and lovely!"}
{"text":"Best mussels we've had, excellent main courses, nice ambiance, service was great, if you love France you will love eating here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland.  I usually get the quiche of the day and side salad.  The food is always so fresh and delicious!  I also highly recommend their mimosas and lemon curd crepes.  While they are sometimes busy and yes, service is sometimes a tad slow, the servers are always friendly.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere at Le Petit, but each time I have gone back the food has gotten more and more average. Its not bad, but there are plenty of better restaurants that have similar atmospheres. What really threw me off was when I saw the cook (Since the kitchen in in the main dining room) heat up my meal in the microwave. Sorry but I dont think Ill be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had read all the reviews on this place and really wanted to try it - so talked a friend into going today.  I ordered a savory crepe with egg, brie and mushrooms (the crepe was buckwheat - which was a nice touch).  Problem is there was sooooo very much crepe and sooooo very little filling it that all you tasted was buckwheat.   The crepe came with a side dish of white beans and I think it was lentils as well.  But that's just what they tasted like - cooked lentils and beans - not dressed at all - not seasoned - just sorta there and unappealing.  My friend ordered the french toast on raisin bread - it came with some chevre (not much), sliced strawberries (not man) and real maple syrup.  I must say, though, that even though I would have liked to see the french toast more lavishly presented with fruit and chevre, the flavor was great, unlike my crepe.  All in all this was a disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the feel and food of this quiet, local spot. The staff is friendly and prompt. The food is French and just lovely. Perfect for a romantic date, day or evening. Close your eyes and you're in Paris  Absolutely get the chocolate croissant (it comes warmed out of the oven) and the white bordeaux!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, thirst quenching beverages, and relaxed service is what we experienced at Le Petit Triangle Café! Their crepes were great as was the French toast (on challah bread ummhmm), onion soup, and ham and cheese omelette. Seating on the patio was pleasant and cozy. Their bread was fresh, made with a baker's touch and I imagine locally made.  Street parking wasn't too bad but it was a Monday around lunchtime.  Looks like a great place for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Probably in my top 3 favorite restaurants in northeast Ohio. Every experience I've had at Le Petit has been pretty great... minus a few forgetful servers (but not a huge deal). My go to is the Croque Monsieur, but their crepes are also amazing. Love sitting outside when weather permits.   Always a solid choice, whether you want lunch, dinner, or just drinks."}
{"text":"There is a waitress here who will play The French Game with you, if you want.  The French Game is where you walk in with your head full of high school French, and try to order and carry on a conversation in French, and she too will make halting small talk with you as you both pretend you're in a foreign country.    You don't have to play The French Game.  But I find it rather endearing that they're willing to go along with you.    I I hope this is what it's like in France; not some overblown pretentious place where the waiters will spit on you if you don't show up in a tux with a beautiful girl at your elbow, but a little, worn cafe in a nice section of town.  The tiles have that sort of can't-be-mopped grit that comes from thousands of feet, and the tables are a little close, but it feels strangely convivial.  You can sit outside and watch the Cleveland locals pass by, which never gets old.    The food has a lot of simple French dishes, each cheap and superbly done; they have crepes and chasseurs and kij and boeuf bourguiginon at a  price of about $12 each, and it's routinely delicious.    The savory crepes are topped with a little bechamel sauce, folded as flat as a napkin, each inch stuffed with a thin bit of chicken or mushroom or salmon - perfectly done, and good to the last bite.  Their steak au roquefort is juicy, served with French bread with a little white cheese spread over it, and it is delicious.    The dessert crepes are also perfection - gooey enough to satisfy my prodigious sweet tooth, yet not oozing so much that it explodes when you try to cut a piece off.  Crepes are a bit of a pretentious thing now, like cupcakes, but there's not an ounce of pretention in these - just quiet craftsmanship, the mark of a restaurant that's served thousands of these and knows what they're doing.    The service is good - it gets a tad slow when there's a lot of people in here, which there usually are, but the waitresses are quick to keep your drinks topped off, and the atmosphere is intimate that you should bring either a beautiful woman to talk to, or a wondrous book to read and ponder.  Time moves slowly at La Petit Triangle, but with the gracious slowness of a well-spent afternoon, the kind of sleepy, just-got-out-of-bed slowness that you don't want to end.  One of Ohio's treasures, really.  Oh, and you can get a full meal, with two drinks each and dessert, for $60 sans tip.  That's a bargain price that really makes it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Good drinks, decent service, bland dinner.  My meal consisted of dry chicken in a crepe with a garnish of dry bland roasted potatoes.  My friend's meals were similar.  I definitely expected more based on the other reviews, but in their defense, they were all brunch reviews.  I would not go back for dinner but the smoked trout app was good."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here, got there and they were busy and waited 10 minutes for a table which was fine. Ordered coffee which was great and our breakfast, it took over an hour to get our food. I don't mind waiting but over an hour for breakfast food is not good. The food when we got it was very good and I would have given 5 stars but that's just too long to wait for an order."}
{"text":"What an adorable place! I absolutely love brunch. This place has a few unique options, as well as the standard brunch fare.  I ordered the spinach, tomato and chevre omelet with egg whites. It was good, a standard omelet.  I actually had a little accident during the meal, in which the entire pepper grinder exploded on my plate. It was quite embarrassing. Luckily, the majority landed on an empty part of the plate. When the waitress saw it, she was more than happy to bring me a new dish, but I had already finished most of the meal.  My friend got the stuffed french toast. It was delicious! Not overpoweringly sweet, and the tang of the chevre with the sweetness of the raisin walnut bread and maple syrup was amazing. Dessert was a chocolate lover's crepe with nutella, strawberries, bananas and pecans. Delicious!  My one thing with the place is that it's pretty small. We were seated in a corner of the restaurant, which really should have only had one table instead of the three or four that it held. I accidentally nudged the table next to me walking out as well. I would like to think it was because the place was cramped, rather than my hips. I shall go with the former.  Anyway, good brunch with some unique options. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I recently called Le Petit to place a \"to go\" order.   1) The employee very rudely answered the phone as if my call was bothersome.  When I said I was calling to place an order for pickup I was told to hold, then heard the employee moan she didn't have time to deal with me.  After holding for 10 minutes I was hung up on (actually the phone was slammed down).  2) I called back and the phone was again rudely answered by the rude woman.  I explained that I had just called and was disconnected but would still like to place my order.  Rather than apologizing for hanging up on me she simply told me she was far too busy to take any to go orders and unless I was willing to wait 1.5 - 2 hours for my food she would not be able to take my order and then hung up yet again.   I have never been treated so rudely in my whole life!  I will never, ever spend money at this establishment again!   Terrible service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First of all, its a teeny dining area, so I would not come with a large group and expect to sit all together. But its perfect for dates, or one-on-one time with a good friend. The decor definitely has the low light, candle-lit feeling to it, but the bar and music give it some sass. I could definitely see coming there for brunch, or maybe in the afternoon for a relaxing drink (and crepe) or late night for drinks and dessert.  Le Petit Triangle serves wine, beer and cocktails, and some delicious crepes and desserts. There are also entrees and sandwiches. I went with a friend for dinner, and we shared the happy hour special bruchetta ($4 = 6 large bruchetta) and some drinks (I had 2 champagne cocktails that were delicious).  As an entree, I got a savory chicken crepe and my friend got the ratatouille. Finally, for dessert, we shared the spiced plum crepe and the flourless chocolate souffle.   I feel like I can sometimes be hard to please with these kinds of hole in the wall places, but Le Petit Triangle is definitely a gem - if you like cocktails, cozy restaurants, crepes, and deliciousness."}
{"text":"Really adorable place. You walk in and are instantly transported to a quaint little cafe in France. I like that the kitchen is completely open. Brunch was good, but not mind blowing. I did not get a crepe, which I regret after reading so many wonderful reviews about them. This is something they do very well. Next time I go, I will definitely get one. I had a nice salmon salad which was very tasty and my partner ordered the brunch filet, which came out over the temperature we requested. No matter, he still enjoyed it. Our server was extremely busy and we waited a while for menus, but I didn't mind. The atmosphere is very stimulating and great for people watching. When she did make it over, she was very sweet and we got our food quickly. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars across the board from me for life normally, but damn. Very disappointed and surprised to find out that my favorite Cleveland restaurant now stops serving dinner a half hour earlier than 10pm which is when I thought they close on Wednesday nights. I didn't know any of the staff but when I lived just around the corner I never had an issue eating dinner at 9:30. Maybe they just don't care anymore and would rather go home early than do their jobs. I also can't stress enough how much I love this place and know that the ownership cares very much about what they put out. Guess I'll have to settle for fried rice across the street."}
{"text":"YUM!!!  The name says it all.  \"Small triangle\" restaurant.  If you're going for brunch you better get there as soon as they open or call ahead for reservations.  We got there 10 minutes before they opened and within 15 minutes there was a 45 minute wait.  Our food was incredible and the staff was efficient and polite.  We'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Irez-vous avec moi Au Petit Café de Triangle ?  Mais, oui!  Ooh la la, Le Petit Triangel Cafe, Je t'aime.    Picture this: A warm spring evening with occasional rain, my date and I enter a warm, tiny French Cafe and suddenly I am no longer in Cleveland, but Paris.  Kate, our server was darling.  She made excellent suggestions and was attentive, but not overbearing.  We started with a \"Happy Hour\" special of Sangria.  Summer = Sangria.  Délicieux.  Then for Hors-d'oeuvre we enjoyed a wonderful cheese plate, which is a great bang for your buck, and escargot which were perfectly prepared.  Avec le dîner we enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine.  Both of our main course selections were bon.  The quantity of food for the price is excellent.  Dessert was a Nutella Crepe and espresso.  My date and I were not overwhelmed by the crepe.  This is my one complaint.  It was a bit thick for what I consider a crepe.  Not terrible, just not extraordinaire.  The espresso was nice and oui, it came with la torsion de citron!  There is a quaint patio which I imagine I will frequent for an evening bottle of wine and cheese plate, or a croissant and cafe au lait on Sunday mornings.  Le Petit Triangle is a beautiful venue for a date.  Take your bien-aimé here."}
{"text":"The Perfect place for a good meal on a date. I have been to France, and french food is hard to service here. People just don't understand it usually. This place makes it fit and comfortable and VERY Good to eat.  it was perfect for dessert, which is what my husband and i were in search of.  We walked in and they were just preparing for a large party. The entire restaurant only holds about 25 people, so make reservations, But we snuck in before the large group got there.  Its quiet and they have it set up so you have no idea how small the space is.    The Food is top notch and the service is wonderful. They can keep an eye on you from anywhere, without hoovering over you. everything tasted fresh and was made beautifully. I really really enjoyed eating there, and i am going back for a full meal again soon.  It was very inexpensive (around 7 dollars for almost anything). Its definitely a great place to get a type of food that usually is hard to find. I really think its perfect for Dates. Enjoy!  We have been back for the Brunch with my parents.  The food is delicately cooked and served.  The food is amazing.  I am glad they don't overweight the dishes like true french cooking with too much dairy, but over all, the food makes you feel full and happy.  The brunch is definitely recommended.    Side Note: In the fall they have a Pumpkin Steamer.  It tastes like Liquid Pumpkin Pie. OH goodness it is good. OH goodness. Definitely think its worth the trip just for that."}
{"text":"Very good experience today at Le Petit Triangle Cafe, which I have been wanting to try for about 3 years now. My friend and I split a crepe containing chicken and spices, which came with quinoa or couscous (one of those two anyway). It also included a generous dollop of mango puree. It was good.   My one issue was the large glass of water that was given to each of us sans our asking for it. I think this is a wasteful practice, frankly, especially in our day and age of  necessary conservation. I do not always drink water with my meal, and it seems like a wasteful practice to dole out this resource to everyone regardless of request."}
{"text":"Other than the always amazing food and croissants I like this place because it's open all day long so no matter what time of day even the odd hours of 2-4PM when all good food places are closed this place is still serving amazing food. I also like this place because the prices for the plates are the same for lunch and dinner. They don't put a little more food on your plate and charge you more just because it's dark outside. With roughly 10 tables this pace is very charming is romantic."}
{"text":"Located at my favorite intersection in Ohio City (a stones throw away from both Momocho and Johnny Mango's), this gem serves up hot and delicious French delights that sated my appetite for \"something different\". Our server was very helpful with helping me narrow down my choice to the Provencal sandwich, buttery crusty toasted sandwich of spinach, gruyere, tomato, and dijon mustard, topped with a sunny egg. With a glass of prosecco, delish. Can't wait to go back to try more things!"}
{"text":"I've been to Le Petit Triangle twice now. The first visit was great. I went on Wednesday around 2 o'clock. I got the Roasted Chicken Croissant and my boyfriend got the Steak and Eggs. Both were delicious. The mango chutney went well with the cheese and chicken. I will say the chicken was a little dry, but I would order it again. Our server was very nice and pretty attentive.   The second visit there did not go so well. I went with two friends on a Sundey around 1:30. Upon arrival, we were put on the wait list, which went by quickly. After seating and getting water and coffee, our server did not come back for what seemed like 15-20 minutes to take our order. I ordered the Croquet Norvegien with the egg (one of my friends did too) and the other friend got the Croquet Monsieur. Around 40 minutes of small talk and waiting for food, we started to become very hungry. One person, who was not our server, stopped by once to refill our drinks. We overheard a server say to her table that their kitchen was backed up and apologized for the wait. Our server never came back. We kept looking for her, but could not find her. After, an hour, she finally brings our food and apologizes for the delay. The food was all great and tasty, but the potatoes were cold. We were never offered some bread or an appetizer while we waited an hour for our food.   Long story short, Le Petit Triangle has great food, but bad service. I would recommend going on off hours. It seems like the restaurant cannot handle a brunch rush. Or perhaps, this is their aesthetic since they are a french restaurant."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place to grab a bite to eat. The crepes are delicious, and I cannot recommend the ratatouille crepe enough.  This is a great place to sit back and enjoy a moment with somebody. Coffee is excellent. Service is very prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I liked this little French creperie in Ohio City. My friends and I went on a relaxed, August evening to this little corner cafe. My favorite was the chicken chutney crepe with a regular crepe (not impressed with the buckwheat.) It came with delicious lentils and a good amount of mango chutney. Their mojitos are really refreshing as well!  Mmmmm."}
{"text":". Great food but the service is horrible. They're so rude. We had  to ask who our server was after15 mins of waiting. He came with an attitude and very rudely put the glasses on the table. When coming here make sure to prepare to wait for half an hour before you get your food."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5 not a 4. The wait and lack of attentiveness was the only complaint. The french coffee was delish. The corner salad was light and tasty. The water was overly chlorinated but thats not really their fault. Got the croque provençal. But added ham and an egg. Tasty as anything. The cod cakes are really good too. Well done."}
{"text":"Wow!!! We loved this restaurant- excellent, friendly service, nice ambiance, great food and the BEST crepes I have ever had! Thank you, Yelp, for helping us find this gem of a cafe!   Most important things first- I had the chocolate lovers crepe made with French dark chocolate, and added strawberries. Wow. This is how crepes should be made. I couldn't believe how delicious it was- so much chocolate but not too much, if that's possible. :) My husband had the peanut butter crepe with bananas and French dark chocolate and loved it too. We each ate every bite even though we had dinner too.  I had a Limota, which is San Pellegrino, and I know it's not unique to this restaurant but I really liked it- sparkling lemonade. My husband had a Black Jack Porter beer from Left Hand Brewing Company and thought it was good.   We were a little disappointed that they didn't offer bread as you waited for your meal, but in the end we were glad because then we had room for dessert! I had the garlic braised pork shoulder which is served over buttermilk mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked green beans. It was really good but pretty plain. My husband had the steak and boursin and enjoyed it.   This is a small (petite) restaurant that seems very popular- we were glad we made reservations. I enjoyed getting to see the open kitchen and watch everything happen.  If we lived in Ohio we would definitely make this a regular spot. I'm going to try to convince my husband to come back again in the next day and a half before we return to Illinois from vacation! :)"}
{"text":"I came here with yelper Yuanjia Z. for brunch, and I have to say this is now one my favorite brunch places! We came here early on a Saturday morning, so we were seated imediately. After browsing through the menu, which has a variety of brunch items ranging from quiches, sandwiches, crepes, omelettes, we decided to share a lemon crepe and a croque monsieur.   I'm usually not a huge fan of lemon-y desserts, but this may have just changed my view on life entirely! It was perfectly tart without being too sour! The berries and whipped cream added a nice flavor to it as well :) The croque monsieur is like your normal breakfast sandwhich but 1000x better! The bread is dipped in egg and then fried...what? We ordered a fried egg on top of the sandwich (extra $1), which is just mind blowing. The garlic potatoes that came with the sandwich were so good, they were gone in a blink of an eye!   I definitely recommend this place for brunch! Service is freindly and fast, with fair prices! Great for dates or just chilling with homies :)"}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and wanted to have a nice Sunday brunch before heading back home. After reading the reviews, we decided to go to Le Petit Triangle Cafe. When we entered, the place was cute and packed, making me believe we'd made the right choice. They placed us in the room next door, which was fine. I was mesmerized by the crepe making technique. I'm half Belgian, so I definitely wanted a crepe. We had the french press for two, which was fine. My husband ordered the scrambled egg crepe with artichokes and pesto. I ordered the smoked salmon crepe. We chose the buckwheat option and maybe that was our mistake. But when the crepes arrived, we were so disappointed. They were as bland as cardboard. The smoked salmon was really salty and overpowering for the combined ingredients and my husbands was tasteless and dry. When we left, the taxi driver told us he had the same experience when he went there a few years back. I do not recommend the buckwheat crepes."}
{"text":"This place has good food. Not unbelievable though. And to be totally honest and kinda harsh - nothing compared to Lucky's. The stuffed french toast was good and not too sweet. Coffee was average. Service was good. The Croque Monsieur w the egg on top was good (there is a pic of it from someone else). It's worth going but I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"had the spinach crepe with tomatoes and mozzarella. matched with locally roasted coffee and great company, it was amazing"}
{"text":"I'm totally in love with the vibe: Cozy, unpretentious, classic French bistro.  The food is always simple, but well-made.  It has a tendency to be super busy during brunch, so if you think of it, try to make a reservation beforehand. If you have to wait for a table, you might be stuck in an awkwardly cramped entry-way. I actually prefer coming here for a weeknight dinner, as it's less crowded but still romantic.  Try the salmon salad if you're looking for a light bite. The duck is also fantastic. Finish it off with a dark chocolate strawberry crepe to get more of a balanced meal. ;)"}
{"text":"As others have commented don't come if you are in a rush - and I highly suggest a reservation. While the wait for brunch was about forty minutes- it was delicious. My sister ordered the croque Monsieur and I he tomato chèvre crepe. We also split a bananas foster crepe for a sweet treat. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place the first time I walked in. I went back last night around 8pm with a great friend and we had an amazing dinner.   This petit french cafe is one-of-a-kind here in Cleveland. A great date-spot with amazing food and the most authentically french menu I've seen since moving back from New York. The ambiance is cozy, francais, cafe with seating for about 20 in the main dining room. There is also a banquet area in the back. The kitchen is open and right in front of you as you walk through the door! The chef and hostess are incredibly friendly, giving the cafe a neighborly feel to it. Soft cafe jazz plays in the background, with some french folk tunes accompanying.   Food-wise, absolutely delicious. I had braised lamb shank, she had escargos' and frommage bleu salad. We ended with creme brulee and bananas foster. I accompanied my meal with a delicious treat, leftover Christmas Ale that was hiding in the cooler. She had a delicious Hot Rum Apple Cider. If you can't decide what to eat, go with a crepe, any crepe will do. They are all incredibly delicious.  We were the only two in the restaurant for a while. Single patrons came in for a quick dinner and drink sporadically throughout the night.   I HIGHLY recommend Le Petit for any kind of cozy time with amazing food and equally amazing service."}
{"text":"Closest thing to eating in France!!! Best crapes sweet and savory I have ever had. Cheap breakfast options. Just amazing. Plethora of drink options and champagne. Wonderful French vibe and call for reservation on the weekends very busy. Wonderful for breakfast and lunch. And now they have dinner options too. I recommend them highly. I will back very soon :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and the monsier croquette with a fried egg is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Almost 3 years since my initial review and I still frequent Le Petit on a regular basis. A craving tends to pop up for me that I just can't ignore! I've taken so many friends and family over the years that it's become everyone's favorite place.  A few updates since last time:   - There are now two dining rooms; the small triangular room you enter into, and the larger room to the side. Both are decorated simply, yet pretty and inviting. There are also now 3 restrooms (a unisex one upstairs in the second room and one for each men and women down in the little basement). - Just recently, they changed their daily quiche from a piece cut from a larger pie to an individual, puff-pastry portion. Still comes with raisin bread and a salad. I thought it was amazing, and great value for the money. - A year or two ago, one of the servers who I've gotten to know gave me a sample of a drink titled the \"Corpse Reviver.\" I laughed at him when he said the name, but I now get it every time I want something a little stronger. Just as it sounds, it's the perfect \"hair of the dog\" if you imbibed a wee bit too much the night before. And even if not, it tastes so fresh and citrusy. - I finally went here for dinner and I can vouch that it's just as delicious, intimate and amazing. A great date spot, whether for a special meal or even the every day.  Long story short, the quality of Le Petit consistently keeps me coming back. Sometimes it gets crowded and the meal may take awhile, but that adds to the charm. We go to different places for different experiences, and this is one of a leisurely pace. I love you Le Petit!"}
{"text":"We ordered  Mozzarella sandwich French toast Chocolate souffle Cappuccino All of them were so tasty!! So we cannot wait to try another menu.  Service is also wonderful as well.  This cafe became our favorite one."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for brunch.  Had a wonderful meal, coffee was strong and good and service was great!  Can't wait to go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good food. Healthier options if you'e for that. Service is not the fastest but nice atmosphere. Good for breakfast/brunch"}
{"text":"Went to brunch here last weekend. I was looking for a place that had a great Saturday brunch, most places have a smaller/simpler menu for Saturdays and that is so disappointing. But not at Le Petit! I'd heard great things and they were all so true!!! The coffee was excellent. And they had a full brunch menu. Very french inspired. We had the house sausage and lemon crepes to share. The crepes were AMAZING. The challah french toast, croque norvegien, croque provencal were all very good too. I'm more of a savoury person but the crepes are what I will come back for! Can't wait to fall in love with more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! The food is absolutely delicious. Everything is homemade. Their menu items are unlike anything you can find elsewhere. I had such a difficult time picking what to order and I am already ready to go back and work my way down the menu! The service was great, everyone was super friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"As a Francophile, this is my favorite French cafe/bistro in the greater Cleveland area. The food is great, service is friendly, and the space is so charming in its urban setting. Many may think of this place as a lunch or brunch spot, but it really shines for dinner. The triangular space is cozy so it can feel crowded on a busy night."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty. I especially love the escargot and the crepes. Be warned, it's quite chilly in the winter, The cafe being small, you get blasted with cold air every time someone opens the door, which can be pretty often some days. I recommend wearing long sleeves and a scarf (and maybe a hoodie) to be on the safe side. The service varies from mediocre to great, depending on the day but the food is consistently good. Make sure to take note of the giant-sized Nutella jar."}
{"text":"AMAZING this is still hands down my favorite place to eat in Ohio City. The savory mushroom crepe is always my goto, as well as the blue cheese house salad."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, this will most likely become one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Managed to stave off my hunger this morning until 10 AM when they finally opened and boy am I glad I waited!  A small, well-appointed cafe with the kitchen in full view of all patrons. I love this aspect because you can watch your food being prepared from fresh ingredients right in front of you, mad kudos to the chefs here for that...  I was seated right away by a very friendly waitress who I look forward to seeing again. However, be warned, come early or make reservations, as I was enjoying breakfast the place filled up fast!  Since it was breakfast, I only skimmed the drink menu but it look like they have a nice variety and will be sure to come back for dinner.  Now, this hooked me....\"pumpkin steamer\", anyone who know me at all will be able to tell you that all things pumpkin-related are pretty much my favorite things to eat so I had to ask the waitress about it. They make their own pumpkin purée with spices and then steam it with milk, what the?? This is insane! It was heavenly, it was the closest thing I could think of to drinking pumpkin pie....I don't even want to know how many calories was in this because I will be coming back for more pumpkin-y goodness. But really, in a French restaurant, who really pays attention to calories?  Since I was in the mood for French toast this morning that's what I got, the stuffed version....so yes, quelle horreur, I skipped on the crepes, but I will be back for them, and my mission will be to try every savory and sweet crepe on that menu!  The French toast was phenomenal and exactly what I was looking for this morning, spot on.  And did I mention they have a giant jar of Nutella as big as my head on the counter?? Bonus!"}
{"text":"A cozy irregularly shaped storefront restaurant in a more residential section, eating at Le Petit Triangle does feel like being transported to a nostalgic remembrance of a quotidian weekend day in France somewhere. The menu is replete with French cafe/bistro classics with some other Continental influences such as salt-cod potato patties. I had the croque norvegien, which was good but not great - the bread was squished under the weight of an almost gloppy bechamel. Service was very nice. The kitchen was slow. But it was lovely to while away a rainy morning listening to French standards and sitting in a charming dining room with friends."}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot. I could hardly choose from all the delicious crepe options but ended up going with the goat cheese + strawberry combo. So perfect, I can't wait to try the others when I go back again this Sunday. My fiancee had the Croque Monsier and wow!! A little but on the more heavy side than my crepe choice, but he let me have a bite and it was out of this world. Our food came out in no time, as well. To drink, I had  the pumpkin steamer and it was the right amount of pumpkin yumminess without being too sweet.We plan on becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"I went here again with my friend and husband last Friday night. I just can't get enough of this place! And I also still can't get over how much it reminds me of a little brasserie in Paris: the decor, the irregular shape of the restaurant, the way the waitstaff and cooks all turn and look at you when you walk inside. (This last thing can be a good or bad thing depending on your own level of self-esteem, but believe me when I say, the employees at Le Petit Triangle do not exhibit any level of snobbery or disgust when they do this; I just mention it because again it reminds me of the behavior of the waitstaff and cooks at any brasserie in France). I hope someone here 'knows' what I'm talking about.   Anyway, being the adventurous one that I always am, I had the same thing I had during my previous visit: the steak and boursin. Still delicious. The reason for my updated review is because this time, my steak was actually medium-rare, juicy and pink inside and dripping with juices. Yea! Perfection at last.  I love you Le Petit Triangle."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Restaurant is really petite :) but it's cute. Highly recommend the lemon curd crepes."}
{"text":"I have been dying to eat here... reservations suggested so we did and got in!  Quaint. Cozy. Adorable. Cool location across from the historic library in the heart of Ohio City.   Our crepes were so very overrated and the place was not even busy! They should either reduce the size of the crepe,  so the filling is accommodated or increase the filling to accommodate the crepe. Regardless,  1/2 of our crepe was left on the plate because it was empty.  Neither crepe had sauce...dry...  The French toast on the other hand, was rich, sweet and oh so dang good!  Lesson learned... try the sandwiches or omelets next time. yasss. .I must give them another chance!  OH! They have Happy Hour 5-7pm weekdays."}
{"text":"I don't know... I really want to like this place more. I love the atmosphere. It's super cute and cozy. But they're just a little off with their flavoring. I've been here a couple times for breakfast and have had their crepes. The way I see it is, vegetarian is harder to make and if you get that right then you probably know what you're doing. The vegetables seemed fresh but overall the meal was a bit bland. Maybe it just needed some salt. Maybe some msg would have helped lol. Or maybe it just needed more flavor! I had the French onion soup too and it was pretty much the same issue.  Oh well. I'd come back but I'll have to ask for extra cheese or something to make up the flavor."}
{"text":"I personally had a really great experience here. On a weekday around 11am, it wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away.  My lox omelette was loaded with fresh salmon, cream cheese, capers and beautifully presented. I subbed a croissant for the toast for an extra buck and it was flakey and delicious.  My friend's crepe with dark chocolate and fresh fruit was also super tasty.  It was the perfect brunch on a rainy day. Overall too the meal was inexpensive and service was friendly and prompt.  The space is tiny though so I could see how it might be a bust on the weekend.  I definitely want to come back here on another weekday morning for a girls brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place Delicious food, great atmosphere ....Nutella crepe!!!!!   Perfect noise level for great conversation.  Steak bousin was fantastic"}
{"text":"Update: Le petit triangle dissappoints.  Now I'm not one to pass quick judgement. . ok well I am but not on a place I have loved for so long as Le petit triangle, but I think at this juncture I have no choice.  Recently while there I found my only thoughts to be Julia Child would be rolling in her grave were she to know about this disasterous french cuisine.   First of all our service. .  if you could call it service was insanely slow. It took 15 minutes for the waiter to get our drink order. . .and they were NOT that busy. 30 minutes after that they came for the food order. Then the food took nearly 45 MINUTES. I ordered a croque monsieur and the boy ordered the steak roquefert. Both plates were drenched in the beige creme sauce (aka gravy) and it was LUMPY EWW EWW EWW! There was way way way too much ham on my sandwich I had to remove more than half of it. Then the potatoes oh they made me sad. They were undercooked. . . and lacking any butter. and in french cooking you can never have too much butter, Right, Julia? The boy's steak which he ordered medium rare was gray. GRAY. yup that's right GRAY. It was medium well at best. And the Roquefert. Now the second cannon of french cuisine is bring on the stinky cheese not um whats that little lump on my steak? There was maybe 1gram of Roquefert.   I don't know if this is now the exception or the norm but it will definitely make me think twice before dining at le petit triangle again :(.   Who ever said you can't teach and old dog new tricks? Le Oui Oui Cafe is revamped  Le Oui Oui Cafe recently changed ownership. The chef from Le Oui Oui bought it rom the previous owners and voila Le petit triangle cafe is born. This is one of the most impresive changes I have ever seen in a single restaurant. It's still the small cozy little eatery it always was. There are still the same 7-8 tables most of which only seat 2. It is still quiet, romantic and full of atmosphere but now I think the largest change was the feeling. Le Oui Cafe was a small french restaurant trying to be something it was not. Now Le Petit Triangle Cafe gives you the feeling you are in a small street cafe in Lyon. The service is definitely in the french tradition. They are very attentive and more knowledgable than average.  The only thing that seems to be missing is the mural on the wall. The menu revamp upon the renaming was amazing. It is no longer a creperie that happens to serve fondue. This is now a true cafe. The flavors are better paired (no more rum raisin crepe with banana), clean, fresh, and crisp.  A vast improvement over the old.    What I recommend Ham and Brie Croissant Artichoke Mushroom Crepe ANY of the dessert crepes Coffee  Wine   Hit or Miss Larger groups  Avoid Like the Plague hmm rum raisin crepes. they were gross.   On a side note they do monthly wine tasting or beer tasting dinner . Always  a good time."}
{"text":"Slow dining but who cares this place is totally worth it. Escargot was amazing! Quaint atmosphere and homely touch"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. This restaurant is a hidden gem in the Ohio City part of Cleveland. It is right across from the library and when we went, there was ample free on street parking. This restaurant has some really authentic french dishes but it also has some more Americanized options for people that are not as adventurous.   We started our meal with 2 shots of espresso. I know this is backwards, but it was getting late in the day and I didn't want to stay up all night. The espresso was pretty smooth, but I wish it was served with a mini Biscoff cookie like in France. We had escargot in butter and garlic with massive pieces of bread as an appetizer. I personally love escargot this way. It is so buttery and delicious. Snails are very similar to mussels but slightly larger and chewier. For lunch I had a salad with balsamic lentils and smoked trout and my man had the croque monsieur. My meal was very tasty, fresh, and light. I normally wouldn't order this but I wanted something lighter and healthier. I did have a taste of the croque monsieur and by golly that was delicious and creamy. We finished our meal with a plain butter sugar crepe which was scrape the plate good.  I highly suggest going here. It is located in a slightly bizarre place, but the food is great and they have some pretty awesome options that you can't get everywhere."}
{"text":"The meals we had here were fantastic. I highly recommend trying the french onion soup. It is made with vegetable stock and is delicious. We had a cheese plate that was quite flavorful. The bread & crackers were fine but it could have used a little more fruit. The ragout was spiced well and had just the right amount of firmness in the vegetables and beans. We started out with great service on a night that was not too busy. Unfortunately our waiter seemed to forget we existed after he got a larger table. He was quite helpful and knowledgeable in the beginning but he left an additional $20 to the check on the table when we waited much to long for him to check on us for dessert. I would still recommend this as restaurant worth trying. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is intimate, has a homey feel, and the staff is super friendly. I had the goat cheese french toast and it was nothing short of a pleasant experience! The smoked salmon sandwich was really over the top it's was epic! I just didn't enjoy the onion soup to much I hope they introduce a better alternative to for there vegetarian soup because there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is a small hole-in-the-wall place that can! French cuisine at an affordable price. The crepes are great, but I am partial to the sweet ones.  During the summer months, the patio is a great option. One may also opt for the second room which is actually available if you prefer cooler temperatures away from the kitchen or if you hate sunshine.  This is a small business that's a refreshing addition to the Cleveland culinary scene. Highly recommended and worth supporting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite café in all of Ohio City! The service is wonderful & friendly and the food is delicious & authentically French. If you like crepes, it's recommended because it's kind of their specialty. Also recommended is the croque monsieur/madame; it's like the ideal ham sandwich.  They change their menu seasonally, so there's always something new to try which keeps you coming back. This is the perfect place in the summer for a nice outdoor brunch under the shady awnings."}
{"text":"Very impressed. I had the meatballs and glass of Bordeaux for quick snack. Sauce was delicate and complex. Meatballs very tasty."}
{"text":"The small triangle cafe is a small tucked away romantic eatery, best suited for a date night out.  The interior is not much to brag about, however they have created an ambiance of small French eatery serving up mouth watering light and heavy affair.  They have retained their specialty of crepes (this place used to be called Le Oui Oui Cafe under different management) as well as have added French influenced dinner items.  During my last visit, I was pleasantly surprised by 4 specials for dinner - something I did not expect from seemingly small early like Triangle Cafe. The crepes are as always delicious, the staff are attentive, the price ranges from $9 to $18 on average around dinner.  Most of the items I so far have tasted are excellent and the portions are just right.   Their seating area is not kid friendly due to close proximity of tables and limited seating space."}
{"text":"I really can't recommend this cute place.  Like others have mentioned, service is slow.  The Wednesday lunch rush was slammed and there was only one server.  I felt bad for her as she was doing her best to keep up.  The food was over salted and under flavored.  I'm a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Just left this usually great restaurant but won't go back or recommend ever again. Ordered two croque monsieurs that showed up in a couple minutes. That should have been a sign. They were challah bread ham and cheese sandwiches with barely poached eggs on top. Served with room temp potatoes. Disgusting. We paid for our drinks and they comped the rest, which was the right thing to do. Lazy chefs that no one is watching at the end of the day. Sad. This place is usually spot on. Not going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder what is wrong with me. I go to Columbus every few months and spend about four days. There I continually explore new places and make sure I go back to the ones that I favor. One of my favorites is La Chatelaine Restaurant. I sit in the rustic dining room where I sip French roast coffee while I savor a freshly baked croissant or I sit outdoors drinking compari and soda waiting for beef bourguignon. In Cleveland I am often on Bridge Avenue where I drive by Le Petit Triangle.   Tonight friends asked me to meet them at Triangle. I read the yelp reviews and seeing how no reviewer began by saying how drunk he was or what a hangover he had I continued to read. There was overwhelmingly high praise for Triangle. While I think fifty million Frenchmen can be wrong. Take the example of French music . Not much is worse. That many yelpers cannot be wrong.   I can only repeat the compliments to service or food. The only disagreement I have is that I do not feel I am in Paris or anyplace else. I know I am in Ohio City with streets that crisscross, Victorian workers' cottages that never looked this good before, tall old trees and easy to find parking. Rather than say if its nice it can't be Cleveland, sit back and appreciate your hometown. Triangle is just one more place to do it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is casual French with a touch of shabby elegance. Comfortable and calming environment. Service was very good as the staff is so friendly. The food was delicious and the quantity was generous. It's the perfect mother daughter dinning experience. Most defiantly coming back with my mother! She loved it here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome: food=excellent, decor=authentic, and waitresses=genuinely nice. I highly recommend spending lots of time in Ohio city and this place in particular.    I'm still amazed that you can get crepes in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The menu looked awesome, but the food was disappointingly bland.  The breakfast options that included brie had very little brie on them and the crepe dishes were very dry. Again, I'm hoping that we caught it just on an off day, because I liked what I saw on the menu.  But I probably wouldn't go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in with fiancé and future in laws on a freezing cold Tuesday in February. One other group was in here. Great service and amazing crepes!!!   Escargot was rich, buttery and garlicky and the bread was a perfect companion to dip in the snail tray. Decent wine selection."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. The crepes are kinda dry though. I would suggest the croissants."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. They removed the savory crepes from the dinner menu for whatever reason so I stick to lunch. Sometimes the wait is more than 45 minutes even though there are only two other tables. I've seen the owner respond really sassily to other reviews and that kind of turns me off to the whole place."}
{"text":"Apparently they do not take walk ins even though they have open tables. It looked like the staff just didn't know how to handle it. Get a reservation or stay home."}
{"text":"I drove 100 miles to go to this place because of my love of French food .   I came here mainly because of the reviews on Yelp Which were mostly favorable.    Come on Yelpers seriously ?   This place was such a huge disappointment .on every level .   We didn't even Finish our meal nor did they bother ask how things were .   Usually if they come to pick up the plates and most of the food is still there They ask how was everything. Nada!   I didn't seem to me that they really cared.  I could go in to great detail but  Why bother , they didn't ,    A sub par experience on every level."}
{"text":"This was a Mother's day brunch, and it was quite yummy! I ordered a steak 'sandwich', it was a slab of steak over 2 thick slices of french bread slathered in cream cheese! Unexpected and delicious!  We shared a lemon curd crepes.  It was fresh, lemony and delicious!  The service was a bit slow, but we still had a good time and really enjoyed the food.  A do-over for sure!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable gem in the heart of Ohio City.  Great food. Small, intimate atmosphere. Close your eyes and you really think you are somewhere on the back streets of Paris.  Crepes are the best in the city. Update in 2012 Fall..... still great atmosphere. Dinners have been very good in the past, but the brunch can be spotty due to crowds on the weekend, so be warned.  Friendly service, but seem overwhelmed at time.  Eggs were good, not great, but get the beans on the side....amazing."}
{"text":"Oh, I see how it is Le Petit. You're trying to get me addicted to you at all hours of the day, even lunch now? What's next, dinner?!   Oui, Le Petit is fabulous for lunch too. Who knew? Well, I do now.   And those midday mimosas made with fresh orange juice were the icing on my cake, baby. No judging.   We sat on the quaint little patio and nibbled on their summer heirlom tomato salad. It was refreshing, well prepared and just all around damn delicious. I loved the edible squash blooms and the super lemon-basil all on a bed of spinach.   Then came out the perfect version of a french sub, the Pan Bagna: Ham, Swiss, artichoke, spinach, olive tapinade and fresh tomato, all piled on a chewy french baguette. Nom 3,000. My sister got the Croque Monsieur, which is comprised of ham, Gruyere and bechmel sauce served warm on grilled challah. Really? That should be illegal because it's too tasty.  Seriously, with the ambiance, great service and divine food... It just doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"It makes me said to give this place 2 stars.  I went here for lunch and was disappointed. My French Onion Soup was lacking salt.  My sandwich was ok. The bread was a little too thick so I had to eat it one side at a time.  Service was fine and the atmosphere is cute. I should've stuck with my gut and just gotten a sweet crepe!  I would be willing to try this place again, but I was disappointed by this experience."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in town, and to bring guests.  The service is always top quality, the cocktails and wine selection are superb, and the food is exceptional, especially for brunch.  This place is a treasure!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful dishes and presentation, though I felt the service could have been a little better. I came here with my fiancé on a pretty crowded Sunday morning. Understandably so the wait was pretty long but that's to be understood because A.) It's busy B.) I didn't have a reservation. No problem.  I probably got there at 11:30 and was seated about 30 minutes later, later than they said but still ok with it. When I get to the table it takes another solid 10 minutes before I see the waitress. Still, all is well though that's sort of a long time before being greeted and getting my beverage order. We both get coffees, I down mine because the cup is very small. I again don't see the waitress for what had to be another 15 minutes. This is starting to become a pretty long morning/early afternoon. Finally get my order in and the food takes sort of a while to arrive.   All in all I just felt like we weren't getting a lot of attention, sure it was busy but there aren't many tables in the joint so it shouldn't have really been like that(?)  Coffee itself is very tasty but small cup and had to wait a while for a refill (sensing a theme here). Food comes by and it's REALLY GOOD which makes this a ying-yang of a review in a way. I got the artichoke crepe with spinach and cheese (cheddar? gruyere?) I can't recall but it was great, had it with the buckwheat crepe. It came with a side of lentils, pretty light and mixed well with the savory-ness of the crepe.   Fiance had the French Toast, also very good and as uniquely tasting as can be for French Toast.  Like I said service was so-so. I don't mean any offense to the staff reading this and I'll definitely just mark it as a one off, though other reviews have been similar in this sense. I was also a server for some time so I get it, things happen like that some afternoons when you're busy so I give the benefit of the doubt. Food was delicious, this is an interesting menu for sure."}
{"text":"Love it. A perfect date spot - it's like stepping out of Ohio City and into a cozy little Parisian cafe.  I have to agree with J.V. on the cuisine being secondary to the ambiance, but still very tasty and good for the price. Plenty of great selections for your petit dejeuner, and now extended hours on Sunday (with a pretty good 2-person dinner special to boot).  Definitely worth your time, check it out.  Seating limited, definitely not a big-group place..."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, and off the beaten path which is nice for a quiet morning brunch.   Avoid the buckwheat crepe - it sounded interesting, but the flavors were so overpowering that I couldn't taste anything else in my meal!   2nd time around, I opted for the original crepe - MUCH better choice!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this little cafe.  The service was wonderful.  We didn't have reservations, and had a baby with us and they made a little table in the back to accomodate us on a Sunday morning.  I had a croque madame and the it was prepared perfectly.  It's a very sweet and casual environment and they are incredibly accomodating.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is just lovely!  I stopped by one snowy Saturday afternoon to enjoy lunch with a friend and I left wondering why I don't come here more often! It is a tight space, but that just makes it more intimate and reminds me of my travels to Europe where a lot of restaurants are cozier than here in the states. No issues with staff and the food was very tasty.   I highly recommend you get the freshly baked chocolate croissant! I also really enjoyed my croque madame and the increase of bechamel sauce that they use on it. My friend got a salad that I had a bite of and it was good as well. I look forward to trying more things on the menu!   Just a note, parking is on the street. The lot behind the building is for the people who live in the apartments upstairs so don't park there."}
{"text":"Le Petit Triangle Cafe is such a cute place. It is small, not overly simple, and sort of quaint. The chef whistles to the French music playing in the small open kitchen, the menu and its prices are proportional to the size of the cafe, and on a good-weathered day you can sit outside. Good service and really great atmosphere.  The food itself is not bad at all, although I think it falls short of being special. It's still good enough that I would go back. Prices are quite reasonable as well, generally ranging from $8-12. (I was there for brunch, I don't think we saw their dinner menu). Within my party, we ordered a salmon omelette (tastiest, but actually quite salty), croissant ham, egg & brie sandwich (not bad), \"fit\" omelette and a crepe of which kind i cannot remember. portions are just enough, not too scant or bountiful.  The overall consensus on the food was \"okay,\" but it was still a really lovely brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and an amazing value.  The coffee, crepes, and above all croque monsieur were delicious and extremely high quality.  Will definitely be coming back here.  It really is a great value and high in quality.  The food takes a while to come, but they make it so carefully that it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Had the spinach, tomato, and cheve omelet. It came with potatoes and two slices of bread.  It was a leisurely lunch which I enjoyed. Not rushed at all. Atmosphere is fun.  It was a good escape from the depression of this ridiculous election."}
{"text":"This is the most adorable little cafe. It feels like an escape from Cleveland right into a little side street in Paris. My friend refuses to eat breakfast anywhere else when she visits. She swears by the lemon curd crepes. I am more of a savory gal and go for the tomato, spinach and chèvre omelet."}
{"text":"I came way back in April with my parents and our Cleveland host.  Per Yelp reviews, I made a Saturday brunch reservation in advance, and was happy I did.  The restaurant is cute, small, personal, active, but not too loud at all that I struggled to hear my family.    Service was attentive, non-intrusive, and the food was really good!    I would normally give this 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 instead, because for Cleveland, this place deserves a 5.  If this was NYC, I'd give it a 4.  Still, not bad at all."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it's been on my list for years to try. Got here early for lunch (around 11ish) and had free pick of table which was nice. My toddler was in tow, but the waiter who seated us didn't point out they had high chairs until we were sitting down which I thought was odd. Normally that's the first issue to address when you see a kid, right? This wasn't a big deal at all. Turns out they have high chairs, woohoo! Pumpkin steamer to start, two thumbs up!   Next up, escargot, I thought it was missing something, I think it was garlic. Still was great! Next the cheese plate, very tasty, but they could have thrown a few more crackers/fruit on. Still things are going good. Then I get REALLY hot. Which draws my attention to the halogen light above the table. I completely felt like it was cooking me (maybe I was extra hot from the steamer). Then I noticed there were bugs in it, and just kinda felt grossed out. So note, pick a table without hot lamp hanging 2 inches above your head. Moving on, the place got busy fast. There aren't many places around like it, so I can see why. I felt like I was in NYC for a second, or Chicago, anywhere else but Cleveland. I liked that. The food seemed to take it's time arriving, but I'm patient. I got the salmon crepe and I have to say I hated the little side lentil salad that came with it. It just didn't mesh well with my tastebuds and my sister ordered the same thing and repeated my sentiments also. We left those basically untouched. Now, the salmon crepe started off really good, but I noticed the salmon was extremely salty. I thought maybe it was cured that way, but my sister said hers was not that salty, so I thought maybe it was just me. It was large enough to fill up on and have some to bring home, so my husband tried at and he immediately pointed out how salty it was. Maybe it was just my cut. With being so hot in this restaurant, I was prob more stressed out and so was my toddler. For example there were so many empty plates in front of us that weren't being cleared that it was just adding to my uncomfortable feelings. It seemed there was only one dedicated waiter and I can understand he was busy, but he wasn't very attentive. So, all in all, while I loved the idea, I prob won't be rushing back. Maybe I'll try again, but I have a lot on my to try list and with a toddler I don't get out much!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. I stumbled in for the first time on a very snowy Sunday morning, and this was like a tiny little cozy French haven. Everything you would expect from a great French cafe/bistro: great coffee, salads, CREPES, and other fun, well-executed dishes. I appreciate that the food is pretty authentic, and everything I've ever tried has been just right.   For dessert, the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas is a must."}
{"text":"One of my friends was visiting this weekend and I wanted to find somewhere different to go for brunch. I had heard great reviews about this place and am glad we tried it. We got there at the same time a lot of other people did so it was pretty chaotic but we got seated right away. We sat outside which is perfect in the summer. The service certainly wasn't great. We had to wait almost 10 minutes for menus because the hostess forgot and our server took a while, but it was a busy Saturday morning. Usually this would knock a start off my review, but the food made up for it!!  So I was extremely torn on what food to get. I ended up ordering the Bayonne Ham, which was a fancy open face sandwich. My friend got the Croque Monsieur and I tried a bite and absolutely loved it. We also ordered drinks (Blood Mary's and Mimosas).   This is a very small and quaint restaurant with a unique vibe for Cleveland. I will definently be back here again. Note: They do take reservations if you have a larger group. I'd recommend it especially in the winter when outdoor seating isn't available."}
{"text":"Went with four girlfriends for a goodbye brunch for a friend who was moving (to San Diego, lucky duck). Called ahead the day of to get a reservation for early afternoon (about 2-3pm on a Sunday), our table was ready when we arrived. Service was good - one friend misunderstood the menu and mistakenly ordered something she didn't like (eyeroll). They brought her a new dish free of charge. We had a french press coffee pot for the table that was promptly refilled. Everyone was very pleased with their meals -soup, salad, and croque monsieurs were ordered. I had the croque madame (a croque monsieur with an egg on top). I spent a summer in France and had these several times a week, my favorite! I was very pleased with the quality and authentic taste. Delicious and perfectly filling. Served with a side of potatoes. I also had to get a crepe! I chose the lemon curd and it was amazing. The curd was perfectly tart and not too sweet. Great brunch experience here, my new favorite breakfast spot in the city!"}
{"text":"WHOA! HOW COME I NEVER HEARD OR BEEN HERE EARLIER?  I decided to come here a random day when I was around the neighborhood and happen to see the restaurant. I remember hearing a lot of friends recommending it so even though i was grabbing dinner in a couple hours, I figure i had to come in and check out this cute little place.  Located on the corner in a triangular spot, Le Petit Triangle Cafe is so cute and welcoming. I love the chill atmosphere! Anyhow I ordered hot choloate and crepe with avacado, swiss cheese and egg. The hot chocolate i loved-- not too sweet and not too bland. The crepe i loveddd!!! The only thing was, I wish they would recommend us a cheese. I asked what type of cheese the waitress thinks is best and her answer was \"i dont know. up to you.\" so we got swiss... and the swiss cheese was just wayy too much for the crepe. It was a bit overpowering.  Either way, i'm coming back here! I love the atmosphere and i love the options!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Le Petit Triangle once, on a business trip to Cleveland in mid-winter.  Getting there on icy roads and sidewalk was interesting, but it was well worth the effort.  Service was friendly but non-obtrusive and the food was excellent.  Crepe with apricot sauce was a diet-buster but worth it.  I will return next trip."}
{"text":"Setting is by far the best part. Food was good. After ordering, expect to wait a while for your food. The staff are nice but all over the place. I really wish the atmosphere was less stressful to match the wonderful aesthetics."}
{"text":"The banana foster crepe is excellent.  It is warm with a delicious caramelized sauce and is topped with ice cream. Next time I'd like to try a chocolate crepe.  At dinner you can only get dessert crepes and the savory crepes are available at lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite before a flight. What a gem of a place! It's small and we got there early in the evening but the place filled up very quickly. My boyfriend got the steak and boursin and I tried the croque monsieur. My croque was to-die-for, especially if you get the fried egg on top. The steak was delicious too but the Croque was clearly the winner and my boyfriend was clearly jealous and I couldn't get myself to let him have more than a couple bites. Will definitely be going back to try their other entrees!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad thing here.   The service is outstanding and the food absolutely delicious!   Had the lemon curd crepe with berries!  Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I think I'm in love with this place.  Everything about it is absolutely adorable.  The cozy interior, the open kitchen, the cute little patio, the friendly servers...I don't know why I haven't been here before now, but I regret that so much time passed.  I had the Ratatouille Crepe with buckwheat flower and a side of roasted potatoes, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The flavors in the crepe were perfectly balanced and nothing overwhelmed or overpowered anything else.  There was sauce on top but it wasn't soupy or overwhelming.  I don't remember the French name, but my friend got the ham and cheese sandwich and was also very happy with his choice.    There's also a fantastic cocktail menu with ample choices.  I started with the St. Germain and Champagne cocktail which was delicious (and I don't even care for champagne all that much, but I wanted to try something different) and also got a glass of the Sangria, which was phenomenal as well.    Without the drinks, the crepe and the side of potatoes were only $12, so not bad considering the decent portion size.  Don't expect leftovers, but I didn't feel like I gorged either.  It was just the right size.      I'll be honest and say that I'm not at all familiar with French food so I can't speak to it's authenticity.  But regardless, if you like tasty food in general this place is definitely worth checking out.  The only warning is that it's on the small side, so I'd make reservations if you're going to go on a weekend.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave Le Petit Triangle Cafe 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the reasonable prices and great service. The restaurant itself is also very cute.  The food, however, was not good. At all. We ordered the french onion soup to start. It was completely tasteless! There was barely any broth and had clearly been overcooked. It was basically just mush topped with a small amount of mediocre bread and cheese. The soup also gave the impression that it had been microwaved instead of broiled to melt the cheese, which is totally unacceptable.  My dinner companion and I then ordered versions of the vegetarian buckwheat crepes. They were TERRIBLE. There was barely any filling at all, and what was there was tasteless. The buckwheat crepe was gigantic and tasteless as well. A crepe, to me, should be petite and contain simple but tasteful fillings. These were so dry that they were barely edible. The lentil and couscous salad that they were served with was mediocre as well.  This menu had a lot of potential. And the space is adorable. I hope we were there on an off night, cause the food was so bad that my dinner companion and I barely ate any of our meals. And we certainly didn't order dessert. We definitely won't be heading back here."}
{"text":"Cold and dreary out...but warm and comforting in La Petit.   After working up an appetite at a 5K in the rain, my pal and I were in the mood for a cozy breakfast.   La Petit did not disappoint.     I had the Croque Monsieur and my friend had a dish with the chicken sausage and eggs with a mustard sauce.  Each was served with a side of potatoes with fresh herbs.   Cleveland needs more of these chef driven dining venues and I hope this one thrives."}
{"text":"Super overrated. I really wanted to like it.   Not bad but definitely not great, at least in my experience. I had the jambon and Brie crepe and my mom had the  cassoulet, duck with white beans.  Hers was lacking flavor and my crepe was nothing mind blowing like these other reviews suggest.  And if they're going for service that reflects how the French treat/regard Americans then they nailed that 'charm.'"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Le Petit over a dozen times and used to enjoy it immensely. My last experience was not so good. The ham and cheese croissant, which used to have a delightfully melty slab of Brie, now had only a Brie tease, smaller than a sad saltine cracker. My other problem was the croque Monsieur was covered in ice cold bechamel.  When we asked the staff to fix it, they just microwaved the whole plate. I was so sad to take family to a restaurant I've always loved for its high quality go the way of so many other restaurants that get lazy. I will give Le Petit one more try because I have had so many good experiences, but I was unhappy with my last experience there."}
{"text":"All in all, we had a pretty good experience. I was craving good french food and the triangle did help with that craving. The only downside to the evening was our service. Our server wasn't very friendly, I'm unsure if he was having a bad night or what but, he just didn't seem like he wanted to be there. The food, drinks and atmosphere was great! We will definitely be back. I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I got breakfast here while I was in town for the day. It's a small little cafe with a nice area to eat outside. I had the Croque Monsieur with an egg with coffee and it was great. I was afraid it was going to be too rich but it was just right.   My only complaint is that the service was a little slow, but honestly I didn't mind at a place like this. I don't think you should come here if you're in a hurry, but rather it's a relaxed cafe to stay for a while."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch and weekday lunch spot. Loved the crepes and other French favorites: niçoise, cassoulet, etc."}
{"text":"Ah, what a quaint little place to have a meal. The hostess or server we first encountered was a little snooty and not so friendly..I will not specifiy which. Thank goodness we had a different server who was super nice and attentive.   They do seasonal wine specials and from this I have found my new favorite bottle. :) Lovely french wines, I need to drink you more often.   Started off with a smoked trout plate, which had lettuce, red onion, capers...all of which were absolutely delectable. DELECTABLE. Need I say this one more time?   I had a classic cassoulet (and this was my first ever). I really enjoyed it. The bf got the chicken breast with spaetzle, mushrooms, spinach, all surrounded in a lovely flavorful broth. Such a simple meal. Yes, I had a taste and it was quite delicious!   Oh, and you better believe we tried a dessert crepe. The turtle crepe = TO DIE FOR. Heavenly, luscious dark chocolate with pecans and creamy delicious caramel.Oh, and not sure if this is too weird but I requested bananas in it, and oh yes it was good. I will be thinking about this crepe for a long time."}
{"text":"Le Petit Triangle is one of my very favorite restaurants in Cleveland! I used to live in France and they get the flavors, ambiance, and experience just right for a French café, with the added bonus of no uppity Parisians :)    I've had many different things on the menu and have never been disappointed. I always try to have room for savory and sweet crepes, since both are consistently great. I've also been for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and have never seen a dip in food quality or experience.   A little bonus is the location, with windows onto imo one of the cutest little corners of Cleveland. Would strongly recommend, whether you're visiting from out of town and can only go to a few places, or if you live here and want to explore!"}
{"text":"After driving all around the Cleveland area looking for a place to eat.  Sunday has about 4 places open and they are all 2 hour waits.  We rolled by the little triangle and saw an open table and jumped in.  This place was great.  If I could, I would have ordered the entire menu.  I am trying to keep my mass under a metric ton so I ordered the cassoulet, known also as French pork and beans.  Served super hot this was a great entree that was super comforting.  My wife had what I would call shit on a shingle if Jaques Pepin cooked it.  It was a bechamel on a ham and gruyere challah sandwich called \"croque monsiuer\" or Mister Crunch to us who use the Queen's tongue.  It was all awesome.  The boy has a PB&J crepe and for dessert we has a crepe with whipped cream and Nutella.  This place was a cute little bistro and it didn't have a long wait.  I would tell anyone to stop here for a bite."}
{"text":"Well it fits the name...rather petite and triangle. ..cozy and a friendly staff and wonderful food.i don't recall the item name, but had french toast raisin bread with goat cheese and it was very good! My wife enjoyed the crepes with lemon curd and compote.all the portions were nicely sized and presented, and didn't leave you feeling stuffed and bloated.the coffee was very good."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday and the food was mostly very good. The quiche was insanely overcooked and dry. The other items we ordered were amazing. The system for seating could use some work. Multiple groups (including myself) just stood waiting for someone to talk to me. Then once we were sat we did not get waters the entire meal and our coffee was left empty almost the entire meal. My theory is, don't make a waiter so busy that  they can't attend properly to their tables"}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past few months and each time it seems to get better and better!   Recently while back in Cleveland, a friend and I decided to grab an early dinner here before going out to see a movie. Now let me tell ya, I doubt you could find a better date place for these prices and this quality. The place itself bares an almost verbatim resemblance to its namesake. It is 'a small triangle' and has an undeniably Parisienne air to it. With its checkerboard floors and cozy quarters I almost felt like I was in France. A tip for the wise, park right across the street by the Carnegie West Library, it's free and quite close!  We started off with an order of Bruschetta. Now, this is no ordinary Bruschetta my friend, oh no. This is my FAVORITE bruschetta in all of Cleveland. Every time I come here I have to restrain myself from just ordering four servings of it and calling it a day. I ended up ordering the Provencal Croque Monsieur. It had spinach, tomato, Gruyere & Dijon and was the perfect fix for a cold (no- scratch that, freezing) Cleveland night. My friend ordered the Smoked trout salad which had wood smoked trout over warm lentils with this great lemon dressing. Confession - I ate almost half of his entree, oops! To finish up we shared the warm plum croissant which comes with a vanilla bean ice cream. Perhaps 'shared' is too broad a word... it was more like, 'I ate a good 3/4's of it and he had a few bites', once again, oops!   The only gripe I have with this place is the amount of time before you actually get your food. The server was lovely (there is only one, like I said it is tiny) and very informative on what to get but it was almost 40 min before our food came out and there was hardly anyone else there!   To sum it up, perfect place for a relaxing and CHEAP bite with a date or a friend. If anything stop by for the atmosphere and a cup of french press, I guarantee, vous l'aimerez!"}
{"text":"My wife and I brought my parents to Le Petit Triangle for lunch, and our experience was very memorable.  The next day, they expressed to us that they would definitely enjoy going back again soon, and I would say that I share that sentiment.  Le Petit Triange is not without flaw, and while some of those flaws are charming, a couple of them weren't.  All in all, though, a positively delightful experience that, despite me putting away about four cups of coffee, led to a glorious afternoon nap.  We lucked out in being seated within five minutes of our arrival.  Two tables happened to open up as we walked in.  During our two-hour dining experience, a number of people were told that it would be 20-30 minutes for a table.  Fortunately, it was an unseasonably perfect day, nearly 70 degrees and sunny, so over the course of our time, the staff set up 4-5 tables out on the sidewalk, lending even more charm to the experience.  On to the food, I started with the onion soup and my stepdad with the pate.  The pate was very low country... earthy, heavy on the pepper, and fairly coarse.  We all enjoyed it.  The onion soup was one of the best I've ever had.  It was definitely the best I can remember.  Exquisitely rich and earthy on the palate, it transforms into a sweet onion candy after a few seconds.  I've never had onion soup with such complexity.  We all ordered sandwiches, a couple of variations of the Croque Monsieur, and the croissant breakfast sandwich.  Unfortunately, this is where some minor flaws creep into the experience.  When one guy is churning food out of a kitchen that is barely bigger than my own small kitchen, it's difficult to time everything perfectly, and this was obvious in the food.  It was all quite tasty, but my potatoes were a long way from being fresh from the skillet, and my sandwich had a luke warmish quality about it.  Still, though, everyone at our table cleaned his or her plate.  Despite our fullness, we decided that we needed to try dessert, so three of us ordered crepes.  I decided to make the sophisticated choice of the tart aux pommes, compared to my wife's choice of the Nutella crepe.  My mom ordered the aprioct and almond crepe.  Well, my wife made the smart choice.  I don't care if it's the easy choice.  I rarely moan about food, but for a minute, things got a little uncomfortable at our table.  The apricot and almond crepe was also to die for, really.  Sadly, the tart aux pommes was merely decent.  I expected fresh apples to be sauteed in butter and sugar and placed into a fresh crepe, but instead, the crepe was filled with apples that had been cooked some time ago.  Still good, just not what I'd expected.  Finally, a quick note on service.  While food took some time due to the aforementioned single chef and tiny kitchen, our service was perfect.  There was one server for the entire place, and she was busting her butt, non-stop, despite being quite pregnant. She had the help of another young woman who was bussing and getting peopel seated, and she was also busting her butt.  Everyone was working hard, and it showed.  I have no complaints about waiting on food.  You come to a place like this to relax.  If you want fast food, get fast food.  While we waited on our food, our beverages were kept full, and good conversation kept us busy.  Overall, just a fantastic experience, one I hope to have again very soon.  While I reserve 5 star ratings for truly flawless experiences and can't give that rating to Le Petit Triangle, I would rate this among a short list of my very favorite Cleveland experiences."}
{"text":"This place was a lot more spacious than I expected. The kitchen (from what I can see) is pretty tiny. They're cooking in a bar space.   We ordered the peanut butter crepe with dark chocolate, creme brûlée, and the escargot.   The desserts were a thumbs down for us. The crepe's filling could've been more evenly spread out. Too much peanut butter in one area.   The creme brulee was runny, they must've not baked it long enough. Though the vanilla taste was very dominant!  I really enjoyed the escargot though. The herb butter was super tasty. And they were cleaned well.   I wish I was able to try more things from here but we already ate before hand.   Service was good. Our waitress was very friendly. I also love the outdoor seating. Cute place"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Cleveland for the Sara bareilles concert just for the night and the next morning. Before we headed back to Pittsburgh we wanted to grab brunch! We sat outside in the adorable front courtyard. The food was EXCELLENT! And the atmosphere was great! The server was extremely slow. But we didn't mind because the food and atmosphere were great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice little cafe in a good little spot. The staff was very friendly and accommodating even having been surprised by a very large group that arrived right before us. They worked through it and even bought us Mimosas for our wait. I had an amazing crepe and my fiancé and a great croissant sandwich with potatoes. I will for sure be returning  and suggest it to anyone looking for a good brunch in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous! Pumpkin steamer with double shot of espresso is 10x better than Starbucks. Lemon Curd crepe is amazing for something sweet."}
{"text":"Ok, I finally tried Le Petit Triangle which was on my to-do list for almost one year. Being someone who travelled in France a bazillion times I can assure you they aced it at bringing a perfect Parisian ambience to Cleveland. I love the decor, I love the music, at the right volume, with the right choices. Waiter service is top-notch, they are all so kind, nice and constantly making sure everything is fine with you.  Oh, yeah, it's true, it's a café and restaurant so I should not forget food. Like I could... Everything was tasty and done with care. I went for Sunday brunch and had a wonderful ham & brie croissant and mushroom and blue cheese crepe. Absolutely delicious.  If I could have any complaint, which is not really a complaint... is that I feel it's very small for such a busy place. I would love to just sit there reading for hours while sipping my drinks, but I think I would feel bad because it seems so so busy. I'll try once though, seems the perfect spot for that.  You absolutely must go there!"}
{"text":"Took my bf here for his half bday. French onion soup was amazing. My drink on the menu said it came with ginger beer (the reason I ordered it) but when I told the server it didn't taste like it, he informed me (which I already knew) that a French 75 doesn't have ginger beer but he could get me some GB anyways. It was because The menu had a typo... uh...try fixing it! Our sandwiches were microwaved, which my bf noticed and was pretty disappointed about. Also, a bit over priced for microwaved sandwiches"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  We made our reservations before we left the house and showed up on time. They put us next to the kitchen. My wife asked for a different table that was available and they refused. Then we heard the guy telling the waitress that we made our reservations an hour ago and he was saving the other table for some people that made their reservation a week early.  We weren't very happy and we smelled like cooking when we left."}
{"text":"A Lovely place in Ohio city neighborhood. If I ever have cravings for a crepe, I'm coming to this place!  The place reminds me a cozy and tiny French bistro/restaurant. The place is casual but has its charm.  Try any crepe- you won't be disappointed. Also, I have tried breakfast food such as egg Benedict's and steak and eggs.  I love coming here with my girlfriends to catch up on things.  Besides, it's a nice place for hidden dates!:)  Try it!"}
{"text":"I can appreciate a member of an establishment reaching out to a yelper and comment about the reviews, means they care. What I dont appreciate is passive aggressive managers.   I would like to point out that I commented on what I saw and how my experience was. I commented on the service, the food, the place and I didn't exaggerate it at all. I never thought constructive cristicism hurt anybody. Clearly it hurt some egos.   I have worked in the food industry so therefore I know a bit on how restaurants run. Back when I was younger I worked at the Diner on Clifton, among other places, which had an open kitchen concept, nobody ever smelled bad there. Then again the owner cared to remodel it with new equiments.  As far as the wait goes, the area to the right where my friend and I sat was full when we came but emptied shortly after, and only 2 tables remained. Means they finished their food before I ordered mine but i still waited 40 plus minutes for my plates. And also I have worked the day after Christmas day, so I am very familiar with the amount of business a place gets.   I had no complains about the food. I thought it was great and so was the service. I paid my bill and my server got her 20% plus tip.  I think the right thing to do is to message a customer, apologize for the long wait then explain how everything goes but a sassy attitude never helped anyone.   I planned on returning to this place but I would rather take my appetite to a place that does not attack their customers through yelp. It's sad."}
{"text":"Le Petit Triangle. It's French! ;)   Modeled after a Parisian cafe, Le Petite is as cute and charming as you'd imagine a true French bistro to be. Indigenous options adorn the menu such as quiche, cassoulet, croissants, ratatouille omelets, croque monsieur, croque madame and more.   Open daily and while I've only been here for breakfast, Le Petit is also open for lunch and dinner. A recent trip brought me in for a Sunday breakfast. After much debate, I settled on the savory crepe of spinach, tomato and chevre with a French press coffee. For dessert, the Tart Aux Pomme Crepe filled with sliced apples sauteed in sugar, butter and whipped cream. All items masterfully perfected by a chef who cooked out of a kitchen that was exposed to the dining room. I felt like I was dining in his home. Very comforting. I will definitely be back to tackle the rest of the menu. Le Petit is my new favorite breakfast stop on the West Side."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there was an extremely long wait for the food.  It was busy, but seemingly understaffed."}
{"text":"Service was tooo long. Got here at 6:30 and it's now 9:08 and finally leaving.  Service extremely slow. Not friendly to us. Felt like we weren't wanted. Ordered the steak medium, an hr later finally came to the table came out rare. Had to send back. No flavor in it. No seasoning. Ordered the beef stew and same thing , flavorless as an app ordered escargot and mussels both which were good (that's why I gave two stars). My hopes were high and was let down big time  and felt unwanted.  Spent $100 bucks too on date nite"}
{"text":"Our crepes were AMAZING! I got the bananas foster and my friend got the lemon curd. So good!"}
{"text":"Slow service. But good food. Lovely crepes. Not pricy at all. It is a very casual place. I wish they had more vegetarian ,fish and chicken options too."}
{"text":"Great little place! Super cute and the staff is so friendly. We were there for Mother's Day and inside was full so we sat on the patio- kinda chilly but we didn't mind. Croque Madame (Croque Monsieur with egg) and roasted potatoes were fabulous! Daughter had the smoked salmon crepe and loved it. Definitely will go back for dinner this summer!"}
{"text":"What else is there to say about this place? The food is amazing. The menu is great. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or Sunday morning brunch with girlfriends. I came here for brunch with my parents, husband and baby and the food and atmosphere was perfect. They were very accommodating and put us at a table with enough room for our baby carrier. My mom and I split two entrees: the croque madame and the lemon curd French toast. Both were amazing and I would have definitely order them again. The crepes are also also delicious, either sweet or savory. I can't wait to come back for another brunch!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely time at my recent trip to Le Petit.  To begin, I don't like pumpkin stuff, like, usually ever. But the gal sold me on their pumpkin steamer, which was made with their homemade pumpkin base. It was delicioussss. Not super sugary, and came served in this huge cup and saucer. It made me so happy. I would come back for that alone.  I also had the chicken croissant and hopped on their wi-fi to do a little work. Le Petit is as close to an authentic Parisian cafe as Cleveland will ever get. The menu is creative and inspired and the interior reminds me of a street French bistro. The service is a bit slow, but I think its because its more of a neighborhood gathering spot. The service is interlaced with a lot of talking and hanging out, with a lot of folks who seem like regulars. I can see how that could effect the review of non-regulars.  I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area. They also have a delicious list of sweet and savory crepes, which my friend kept constantly raving about (she had the peaches & blueberry). Don't miss out on this cute little gem!"}
{"text":"Such a great place for a cozy and quiet date night. They have a great selection and friendly staff. The ambiance is quaint and Parisian. I highly recommend this place! I had the Escargot, cheese plate, boef bourginion and a crepe. I have no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and love the small intimate atmosphere. Would recommend this place to anyone coming up to the city. We stop every time we can!"}
{"text":"Crépes are delish here. French press for 2 is a deal. Steak & eggs = great taste, great deal"}
{"text":"First a few Don'ts:  1) Don't come without a reservation.  2) Don't bring young kids  3) Don't be in a rush  If you do any (or all) of the above, you will likely have a 4 star experience as well. We waited about 45 min in pretty uncomfortable chairs shoved behind a counter top. The waitstaff looked disdainfully at our kids. And the service was slow.   But, if you are looking for a leisurely brunch in a charming and quaint restaurant where you can linger over delicious food, you've come to the right place.   Everything was exceptional. My 7 yr old daughter didn't leave me even one escargot. My beer mimosa was huge- I barely could finish. The crepe was just like they serve in Paris. The croque Monsieur was huge and one of the best I've ever eaten.   I would love to go back, if ever I was in Cleveland again without the little."}
{"text":"This was a great place for dinner. We came across the restaurant while walking in the area. Originally thinking it was a coffee shop. The menu has a wide range of selections, many we couldn't pronounce, at reasonable prices.   The staff was helpful and provided great input on the various options we were looking at. My duck was made perfectly. My husband was impressed with his salmon salad. The flavors were matched and each mouthful was a delicious experience.  I don't rave much about restaurants as I expect them to be good. This place went beyond good."}
{"text":"This adorable little place is a lovely French Cafe!  We went for crepes and tea and it was lovely.  The menu was filled with choices.  The kitchen was open and we were able to watch our food being created.  The Nutella strawberry crepe was lovely.  I saw others come in for afternoon snacks of wine and cheese-- another possibility next time.  Great location also!  #chifoodie #cleveland #foodtourism"}
{"text":"Our family loves going here for brunch.  There is something for everyone.  During the warm weather we love sitting on the outside patio.  This way we can bring our well behaved pup all along.   The crepes are delicious. I love the savory one while my daughter loves the sweet one.    Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"My little sister used to wash dishes here. She invited me for a lunch one day and it was fantastic! I remember she said you have to make a reservation, so keep that in mind. It's a tiny place! But the food is amazing! I had the Croque Monsieur and it was divine. Great for a date night or maybe a brunch for two. Don't miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"YUM. I've loved everything I've had here from the French onion soup to the crepes to anything in bechamel sauce. The service is friendly, it gets pretty busy on weekend brunches and dinners so would recommend a reservation. Highly recommend the lemon curd crepe, it's all homemade and truly to die for."}
{"text":"I don't understand what people see in this place.  We came here just as the place opened on a Saturday morning for brunch.  My girlfriend ordered the smoked salmon crepe and I ordered the quiche of the day.  The crepe was completely overwhelmed by the boursin (which tastes like cream cheese), while the little bits of salmon did not give it much flavor.  The quiche tasted like it was microwaved, and the side salad was underwhelming.  I also ordered the nature crepe for dessert, which ended up tasting sort of bland.  We were the only people in the restaurant so the waiter was very nice to us... however, the food took half an hour to arrive.  Not sure why?  We'll probably stick to Lucky's and the crepe place in the West Side Market."}
{"text":"For those who don't want to read a long review:  food, service, ambiance is amazing, and the prices are low (nothing over $12).  recommendations: croque madame/monsieur, boeuf bourguignon, roasted chicken croissant, breakfast sandwiches, banana's foster crepe, spiced plum crepe, cheese plate, french mojito, pomegranate sparkler, cassoulet, tuscan bean soup  *note* this place is pretty small, so if you're going on a weekend or with a big party, i recommend calling ahead.   for those wanting more detail:  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. We had always been meaning to try it, but ended up stumbling in here one Friday night when the restaurant we had intended to go to had too long of a wait. It was fate. This place is amazing! First I'll start with the ambiance: you walk into this restaurant and feel as though you have been transported to a quaint bistro on the streets of Paris. They have it set up exactly like a parisian bistro, with the 2 chefs in the front whipping up delicious meals and fabulous crepes. Next, the service: out of this world. You get service to the level of a really fancy, expensive restaurant, yet nothing on the menu is over $12. We've been here numerous times, but one of the occasions was for New Years Eve with a party of 13. While the restaurant is literally a \"Petit Triangle\", they had a room to the side where they can have events and larger parties, which is where they seated us. The waitress was knowledgeable about all of the food and drinks (especially wine and beer) which was super impressive, and handled our giant party flawlessly (they accommodated separate checks). And now, the FOOD. You really can't go wrong with this place, order what even you want. However, what we have had has been incredible. We LOVE the croque madame, its done perfectly, with the runny egg on top and delectable bechamel sauce. The boeuf borguignon (which was a special) was FANTASTIC. The cassoulet was scrumptious. You MUST finish off your meal with a crepe!!! The two best ones we've had are the banana's foster and spiced plum. They are sooooo delicious!!! And for a real treat, be sure to get the French Mojito. It's a scrumptious mojito made with lavender. I've never had anything like it. Long story short, this place is the best.   note: this"}
{"text":"Je t'aime, Le Petit. Je t'aime.  Walking in to this tiny restaurant is like strolling into a cafe in Montmatre in the fall. High ceilings, narrow space, open kitchen and big bright windows. It's a dream.   The food is, of course, splendide! The cassoulet is warm and lovely, and the canard is very good. The ratatouille is a great vegetarian option, very fresh. The steak is fine, and the poulet du chasseur is very good. And I definitely suggest getting the marinated olives or pate for a starter. Just lovely!  The service is a little lacking, I will admit. If the restaurant is busy, expect some unusually long waits. Everything else makes up for it, though, and proves this place is just perfect.  Merci bien, Le Petit!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for breakfast and thought it would be nice to stop by one day just for coffee and crepes.  The atmosphere is unique and pleasant, food is good (I had quiche), even though the service is slow. I also had a cup of cappuccino.  Not as good as what I had in other bigger city or overseas (I miss coffee in Australia...), but at least it wasn't Starbucks:)"}
{"text":"Really fantastic spot for Brunch - Croque Monsieur and any of the crepes are fantastic.  Quote Note: It's a bit annoying, but they keep changing the required party size for reservations. It's a small place, so I understand - but some consistency when I call in would be nice!"}
{"text":"Torn between a 3 and 4 rating. The food was definitely a four.   Croque Provençal with fried egg, pictures shown, and smoked salmon omelette were so very well presented and thought out.  Delicious! Ditto for the pumpkin steamer. Wait staff are SO nice... Really the sweetest girls... But the wait for coffee, or a refill on coffee, will drive you nuts.  Same with the bill.  Tough to get out of this place.  If you have all day and just want to linger, this would be a four star for sure.  If you have someplace to be, this is not your stop today."}
{"text":"Very nice but disappointed.  Still, planning on returning because I think this restaurant has some potential.  Our waiter Tom, was such a delight, friendly and knowledgeable. However, the chef did not live up to professional standards.   The Cassoulet I would rate a solid D.  Not just because it was served cold and way over salted. Rather because, it lacked the LOVE this dish is supposed to bring with tender hunks of meat, sausages, duck, and a creamy texture of confee layered beans with a toasted bread crumb topping. Instead the dish served, was a disaster. It was so bad, the Cassoulet police should force them to improve or cite them and threaten and never to allow them to serve this classic again unless they are on a penal colony island. To describe our Cassoulet, think Risotto only with decayed beans, mixed with tiny, incey-mincey silvers of meat served, in a plain white bowl lacking everything from taste and presentation to something akin to what you would find in the back of a refrigerator of an office lunch room. 2nd. Entrée: Saumon au Pernod: Rated C=  Pernod, (an anis-flavored liquer) is a layer of flavor to be expected in this dish. Who knows maybe the chef who over salted our Cassoulet forgot to add this note to the dish? The Salmon was broiled, a little over cooked,  and served on a small bed of lentils with baby asparagus crying for a Pernod sauce the chef decided to abandon.  The menu looks impressive and for this reason, I will give this restaurant two more chances. Planning to try the Brunch and a Dinner this summer. Hopefully, the Chef will be on with an A=Game."}
{"text":"Great experience! I got the garlic braised pork shoulder. It was good but I was so jealous of my husband's duck, chard and sweet potato which was incredible. The wait for our food was a bit long but the vibe of this place was so charming and they had west African afropop jazz to pass the time.   One less than charming feature was the tatted up, bearded, hipster chef who sampled what he was preparing frequently.  I thought that was weird/bustable offense by health department."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Super small location so a little difficult with everyone talking and bustling around! Also, we were by the door so we often were in the conversation with those coming in for a table! HOWEVER, we will definitely go back for brunch again soon! MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable spot to get breakfast, brunch, or lunch with your family or gal pals! I love the ambience (feels very authentic), the giant jars of nutella, and tons of options. If you love crepes, this is your Cleveland go-to. Cute decor, too."}
{"text":"The food is EXTREMELY salty, at least what I got, which was the salmon crepe. I'm no chef, but I honestly felt like I could have made a better crepe.   The service was decent, though, and my coffee mug never went empty."}
{"text":"Happy with my experience, but I've had more mind blowing French experiences! This place was cute, but cramped. Definitely not ADA friendly. I only saw them seating people in one area but from the outside it looks twice as big... So I don't know what I was missing. Honestly they are busy as soon as they open, so I'm pretty sure you should make a reservation if you really don't want to wait a little.   I don't know, there isn't much for me to say about this. Nothing to really rave about or nothing to complain about. Quiche was not special at all, but the shasuka I would order again! I went for brunch, maybe a dinner visit is in order to really figure out how I feel about this place"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Tuesday morning. The quaint French decor- chic but effortless paralleled the food! We ordered the smoked salmon omelette and lemon curd challah French toast were near perfection. Absolutely coming back !"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  Food was ok; service was iffy.  Not a place I'm running back to.  FULL STORY:  Came here for lunch with a friend recently.  The place is small -- maybe 12 or so tables.  I guess the atmosphere fits with the neighborhood cafe idea... it's definitely an old building with tight seating, so I would come in expecting that.  It didn't seem busy the day we went -- there were 4 other occupied tables.  Our orders were simple -- a salad and a crepe...  but it took over 20 minutes for drinks and almost 45 minutes for any food, without an update.  That was surprising given the staff-to-customer ratio that afternoon.    I thought the food was alright... nothing bad, but nothing outstanding.  I was at least expecting some great bread, but it seemed pretty average.  The coffee was good (Rising Star apparently)!  What detracted most from the experience was the negative attitude from staff members... it came off kind of passive-aggressive for no clear reason, which hasn't been typical of my experience at other local restaurants around Cleveland.  That was a bummer.  If you're ever around DC and love French food, check out Bistrot du Coin!  That place is amazing and very authentic!    Note: street parking"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today for my birthday   I got the peach pom daiquiri. It was so so delicious. Just enough bite and tart.   For the app I ended up going with he ham and lentil soup which was so so scrumptious. To be honest I could have eaten a whole bowl.   For my entree I went with the steak and Boursin open faced sandwich. It was so good. I also added an egg. the steak was cooked to perfection. The potatoes it came with were super good. They fell apart on the plate.  For dessert I opted to go with the nature crepe with strawberries. For me, a crepe is a sensitive subject. I had one in France and that was the best damn thing I put in my mouth. But I must say the crepe here gave it some mean competition. It was the perfect consistency.   Really good experience."}
{"text":"Is your appetite petite? What about your patience for good food? Le Petit Triangle Café aims to address that smallness in your stomach and your quest for quality bistro food. On face value, the Triangle is a quaint, truly-bistro-esque place on the awkward corner of Fulton and Bridge Ave.  However, beauty is only skin deep. You'll find that there is actually not much more than meets the eye in the Triangle. You'll find that the \"le petit\" is no understatement, it is absolutely embracing the smallness that makes it a bistro. The indoor seating looked cramped and tables line the walls. In fact, if you're waiting on a table, be prepared to wait outside the threshold of the outdoor dining area. This area is tightly packed too, as small metal bistro chairs and tables hug the exterior of the restaurant. You really do feel like you're having a petit déjeuner in Paris, until some big truck pulls up at the light on Fulton while its exhaust croques your monsieur.  The menu is easy and will probably have something for you to enjoy. A small tip I can give here is that you should check out their online menu to see the selection. At the restaurant, the menu touts the dish titles mostly in french, so you don't want to be lost in translation. We went with the Caprese Sandwich and a Spinach and Chevre Omelette. The Caprese Sandwich was good, very fresh tasting and light... I really enjoyed the fresh mozzarella. The lentil-cous cous salad was also a nice addition to it, well seasoned and great texture. The omelette was a hit with the goat cheese but seemed like it was lacking with a little salt. Otherwise, the food was merely an afterthought. Not what I expected.  The service was warm and accommodating but we found ourselves waiting longer than what seemed necessary. You would think that an addition of one more waitstaff person would ensure a quick moving along of service, but I guess because this is a bistro, things are more laid back. I understand that.  Three stars, because that certain \"je ne sais quoi\" you're looking for at Le Petit Triangle's is more likely to be found in the conversation you share with someone there than in the food."}
{"text":"Took about 15 minutes for someone to even come to our table and get drinks. It was the bus boy who did because he noticed the server hadn't even been to our table yet. He was the only reason we didn't walk out. The server was completely unapologetic. Spent so much time focusing on the larger party next to us and never noticed when our drinks were empty. Food took over 40 minutes (I only know because I had a phone call while waiting, I didn't time anything nor am I exaggerating), and the food was just ok. Certainly not worth waiting that long for. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This was a little early in my foodie education and thank you to the great friends who took us. It was a great intro to French cuisine."}
{"text":"Came for lunch last week and got french onion soup and crock provencal with fried egg.  Both delicious.  Cute outdoor seating area but small.  Took a star away because this drunk guy wouldn't put his cigarette down the entire meal.  Would come back."}
{"text":"I was in the back room with several others for a casual business/networking meeting. Although Le Pêtit Triangle is intimate and would be a great date place, the back room, with plenty of plenty of lighting, was not too intimate for us, yet it was not stuffy like a typical conference room in a suburban office park.     It's a great little café, sort of a French equivalent of the America mom and pop dinners. It can be cramped [the place seats only 16 in the front room although there's more room in the back, and the kitchen is open, immediately visible upon entering.   The $5 mussels (happy hour pricing) [a dozen of them] were solid. The butter sauce had red and green peppers and onions. My spiced plum crepe, ($8, this is the normal price) was trés bien [is my French isn't pretentious]. There's also an extensive beer menu of 15 or so microbrews from all of the USA.    Is this is the only type of café like this in town ? If so, c'est dommage."}
{"text":"An Ohio City treat.  Sit outside, enjoy a chocolate crepe, relax and take in what makes a tiny independant oooze charm, atmosphere and character.  Enjoy the street scene of locals out and about - walking and biking, as opposed to driving from the garage to the store and back.  You dont find this in Crocker Park.  It is the real thing, not some cookie-cutter corporate \"creperie\" where the waiters wear berets and recite \"french-ish\" specials.  A welcome addition to the Cleve's food scene."}
{"text":"Not sure what I can say about this adorable little cafe that hasn't already been said. So, I'll keep it short to five points.  1) It's cozy. You'll want to take off your coat carefully so you don't inadvertently smack another diner in the face.  2) The Pomegranate Iced Tea is all sorts of awesome. Get it.   3) The menu is nice and diverse from sweet crepes to plenty of savory options. There's something to satisfy anyone.   4) The Chicken & Chutney crepe was a fantastic consistency and filled hunks of bird and topped with a flavorful but almost too sweet chutney. There's a large pool of the sweet stuff on the side - go easy.   5) Service was efficient but not overly friendly. This didn't rub me the wrong way per se, but if you're seeking that super welcoming neighborhood spot, I didn't get that vibe from Le Petit Triangle.   In terms of crepes, Le Petit serves 'em up right."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance. Perfect date spot in Ohio City. To boot the food was amazing.  Beer list was impressive, but the wine list left a little something to be desired.  Be forewarned, seating is limited to 16 approx.   And, if the weather is in the single digits, the place will reflect it. (I.e. be smarter than my date and I, dont sit by the windows)."}
{"text":"Despite the cozy atmosphere, interesting menu and good food, I am giving this place 1 star due to a rude guy named Billy-  the most hostile host we have ever encountered. I called ahead and was told that our name and 4 people would be on a wait list in an hour. We were having brunch to celebrate our daughter's 25th birthday. When we arrived they had no idea that I had called and we were told there would be a 45 minute wait. Despite this, we decided to wait for a table. But when we went inside to check on the status, Billy went off on me and actually told me it wasn't his fault and to \"go someplace else\"!!!! He was so nasty and rude. And he never wrote our name down on the wait list!!! I wish we had gone \"someplace else\", but I was trying to stay calm and honor my daughter's request to eat there for her birthday.  Once we finally got seated the meal and service were fine. But I was so offended by Billy's attitude that I would never go back. And during our meal we overheard him talking dericivally to the other servers about another customer."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Le Petit around 3:00 for a quick mid-day bite. Being the only table in the restaurant, we were hoping for some nice TLC to go into our dishes; however, we were extremely disappointed.   My boyfriend ordered the croque Madame- which had really dry ham and seriously overcooked egg. He cut into it and not one ounce of yolk oozed or even jiggled... Extremely disappointing when you order a sandwich with a fried egg!  My omelet with smoked salmon and Boursin was not any better- Extremely thin, flat egg that looked and tasted exactly like rubber, at most one half ounce of smoked salmon, and way too much cheese. I had two bites before throwing in the towel. The wheat toast I ordered was good, though -a nice toast and crisp outside, yet still had a little softness.   I really wanted to like this place.  I could forgive it if one of us had a really good dish, or if even one of our eggs weren't overcooked, but unfortunately we won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"We found this place on accident. On a trip to Ohio city for some brunch, our original destination was jam packed with a line out the door. So we drove around and happened upon this wonderful little cafe. This is the cutest breakfast place I have ever been to. It's very small and runs to a point in the back, hence the name \"triangle\" cafe. There is only about 15 places to sit and a couple more outside. I'm assuming the earlier you get here the better.  The kitchen is right in the middle of everything which I thought was pretty cool. They sat us in the back and there was some very nice French music playing in the background. Perfect ambiance for a brunch. I then ordered and ate almost all of what I will describe as the best crepe I have ever had. Hands down, period, goodnight. It was stuffed with Nutella, strawberries, and bananas then topped with whipped cream. Just delightful.  My boyfriend had the quiche special and raved! Especially about the cinnamon raisin toast it was served with.  The service was wonderful. It was just the perfect start to our jam packed day and I'm so glad we found this little place. I will be recommending it to anyone who will listen to me!"}
{"text":"I love me some brunch. Based on the yelp reviews, this place seemed perfect for brunch with mom, and it was. The place was quaint and cozy, with character. I enjoyed a rich and overwhelmingly delicious breve alongside Chicken Cheese Chutney. You get what you pay for, and even the view out the front window is eclectic and lovely. Next time, I am all over top of the Orange Trio Crepe."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Their ham and Brie croissant was amazing! I know where I'll be eating next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast here on a Sunday morning.  The food and service were both fantastic given how busy the place was.  The salmon crepe I had was packed with salmon...a steal for the price.  The hubby had the veggie, egg, artichoke crepe and was a huge fan as well.  We took the dark chocolate crepe to go as a special treat and loved it too.  What a wonderful place in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with this cafe. Intimacy and flavour sum it up.... My favourite dish would be the savoury tomato spinach chèvre crepes ... fresh roasted coffee .. The best service I have encountered in Cleveland ..."}
{"text":"Extraordinary food and service. A wonderful culinary experience. Will definitely be recommending and visiting again."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Croissant amazing, great mimosas, great food, great service. They're very accommodating to variations of items on menu. Four stars is because the egg white omelet was a bit under-salted and the bread was not toasted enough. Otherwise, everything was perfect. The chocolate croissant came out warm and perfect, the vegetables in the omelette were obviously sautéed prior to being put in the omelette and the service was great. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walk through the doors of Le Petit Triangle, and you are automatically transported to an authentic Parisian Cafe.  And as a francophone who has been to ol' Paris more than once, I can vouch for the authenticity of the vibe.    This place has been on my list of \"must visit\" locations since returning to Cleveland, and I was glad to find myself down in the Ohio City area near lunch one day last week so I could spontaneously pop in and peruse the menu.    Incidentally, I had also been craving escargot recently (don't judge, if you've had a good iteration of this dish, you will, too).  My eyes made a beeline on the menu towards this particular appetizer and I put my order in right away.    I was not disappointed when - about 15 minutes later - my sizzling hot, fresh escargot was delivered to my table with a side of crusty baguette slices.  I could smell the melted butter, garlic, and herbs wafting out of the piping hot dish, and started salivating in anticipation of my first bite.  Mmmmmmmm, heavenly!  The inner dragon that had been roaring for me to satisfy my escargot craving finally quieted as I knew I had a failsafe place to come the next time I got an itch for some baked snails.    Food aside, everything about this place reminds me of Europe: the intimate tables, the large bar in the front, the tall windows facing the street, and decor that is warm and inviting without trying to be perfect.  The service was \"just enough\", with my server unobtrusively refilling my water and bringing me my food, while also allowing me to peruse the novel I had brought to keep myself company.    Treat yourself to a mini vacation across the pond with a visit to Le Petit Triangle!"}
{"text":"A most delicious treat! the crepes are hot, perfect, and stuffed with whatever your mind can imagine, the spaezle were soft and delicious, and the creme brule was crispy/hot on top and creamy/cold on the bottom.  The service was a little slow but I would go back there any time. Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here when they were stopping through town since they love french food! Parking was a bit tough, but we found side street parking a couple blocks away, which was fine since it was during the summer. We sat on the small side of the restaurant across from the kitchen, and it was a small table, but comfortable enough. My parents enjoyed a soup and salad, while I had the roasted chicken croissant. It was a flaky and delicious croissant, and had mango chutney on it, which was totally different but yummy. After our meal, I had a latte with soy milk while we chatted. I've been to Paris before and can say that this place definitely reminded me of the cafes there!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible but took an extremely long time to be brought out to us. Ordered the French toast and a salmon omelette, so nothing that should have taken more than 20 minutes. Waited maybe at least a half hour for it. Was also told they needed our table at a certain time which was sort of uncomfortable. But,the atmosphere is very nice and the food did taste very good so 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, especially the Lemon curd crepe. Service was not good at all. We waited a solid 25 minutes for our food with no update, while others seated 10 minutes after us were served. My friends omelette arrived with a huge hair all across it, which the remade, but that took another 20 minutes. They did take it off the bill, but never apologized or even came back to see if our meal was OK."}
{"text":"Their brunch offerings are pretty traditional, although I did like their Nutella french toast -- definitely a nice spin on a classic. Their dinner service was a fancy French dining experience at down to earth prices. I'd definitely recommend the beef stew was absolutely delightful!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. The food was just awesome! The portion was large enough but I also ordered a cup of soup. The soup was creamy and buttery and the entree was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. The only draw back is how tiny the seating area is. Love it and we'll go back."}
{"text":"My all time favorite brunch spot in cleveland. The food is amazing. I def recommend making reservations on a Sunday because they are always slammed. My friends and I go and stay for hours drinking coffee and mimosa just chatting. Great atmosphere and the waiters and waitresses are so friendly. The crepes are a must. I recommend the chocolate lovers or the turtle crepe."}
{"text":"If only I could give more stars!  This is now one of my favorite cafes in the world! I enjoyed absolutely everything in there: food, music, ambience, service, and every little detail. The place has that European charm that I miss so much in America. That evening on April 23 when my wife and I celebrated our anniversary there, was exactly like those we had in Berlin. There were lots of people chatting, drinking, and laughing, lots of sounds and smells (we could see and hear how food was prepared), and music was just perfect (I wonder what it was). I love it when it's loud and crowdy in cafes. That's how it should be.  I especially want to thank the staff for not coming and asking \"Is everything ok?\" when I am in the middle of chewing. I really hate it when waiters do it here, in the US. Also, I can't thank enough the person who made Bolinhos de Bacalhau for us. They were like crunchy salty heaven! It was the best appetizer we've ever tried!"}
{"text":"I accidentally went to this place after learned that I had to wait for 2 hours to get a seat at Momocho @ 8 PM.  This place is a really cozy and cool place.  It gives me a feeling of home-style, yet classy reataurant.  Food quality is very good. We went for dinner but supposed to be much better for breakfast and brunch. Anyhow, every dish is nicely decorated.  Taste is very good, even tho not superb.  Price is great!  Most of dishes are lower than 10 with my 6 oz steak is only 12!   Desserts are very very good, too. Nice selection of wine that I rarely see in other steak houses.   Overall very satisfied and will definitely come back. Now, I have found my place!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my mom or my friend Kirsten!  We have the best time when we go.  We feel like we are on vacation when we go.  It is just so different.  The food is awesome.  The croissants are amazing along with the Beouff Bourgonion (incredible).  The service is sometimes slow because they don't have many servers on.  But other than that I go probably once or twice a month....I love it here ( i already said that).  :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"How do you give zero stars?   The most unprofessional restaurant staff I've ever experienced.  From the moment we walked in at 3:15 pm (they serve brunch until 4) the staff was rude.  A cook (fat white guy with large beard) looked at us through the window and said \"Fuck,\" in frustration that new customers would dare to come in 45 minutes before they shift from brunch to dinner, forcing him to do his job.  Our server (flamboyant white guy with poorly maintained facial hair) not only had a horrible and rude attitude, but then bragged about displaying that attitude within earshot of our table.  He told another staff member that one of his customers asked about the status of part of her order, and he \"growled\" at her, like a heavy metal band.  When we complained to the manager, she made excuses for her staff by explaining the \"very long brunch shift,\" they'd had.  She did absolutely nothing to fix the situation or convey how inappropriately her staff had behaved.  All this for mediocre food and a bad Bloody Mary.  The sausage was actually a meatball but it was ok."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe. The omelet, potatoes and starwberry nutella crepe was amazing!!! Perfect portion sizes. Great service as well. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"What a cute find. Such a charming, local-feel restaurant with the food being cooked right in the open kitchen by one chef (at least when I was there). Go for their famous egg-dipped breakfast sandwich. Other things are ooookay, but next time I will definitely just go for their specialty sandwich."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for brunch in the summer. The outdoor seating is great in the heart of Ohio City. It is also dog friendly, so my friend enjoyed bringing her pooch along. Everyone ooo'ed and ahh'ed over her, brought her water, etc.  The inside is small and everything is a bit tight, but you don't come for the space.  The food is great. I've tried a few of the crepes both savory and sweet and never been disappointed. I also really enjoyed their potatoes. I always add them as a side dish if they are not a part of my meal."}
{"text":"It was alright. Kind of a fancy ish place. Food was good. It's really dark inside the restaurant. The service was slow. They couldn't split the check for 6 or more people. There was an automatic gratuity also that was 30%.  I got the Pâté which was alright. Probably wouldn't go there again except for the crepes. And definitely not with a big group."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots in the city. When we're having a hard time making a decision where we should go, we always end up deciding on Le Petit Triangle. Lemon curd french toast is a favorite - sweet and slightly tart, roasted potatoes are a must-add to any dish."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is fantastic. The menu is small, but big on flavor, and they offer just about everything you could ask for in a French restaurant, for very, very affordable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this place after a long night out downtown. She was lucky because it couldn't be a more perfect place.  Its exactly what you want to see in this city. Very quaint, friendly, original, cozy and, oh yes, the food was excellent.  The crepes were out of this world. I wanted to try everything on the menu. It was difficult to decide. I have this appreciation for finding places like this and being overjoyed with how different they are without going over-the-top. Needless to say it gives me yet one more reason to venture into the city more often."}
{"text":"Sunday Morning we call the restaurant we speak to a very nice lady that tells us to come in just two in our party she said should be no problem. We arrive the tall guy says to us sorry we are full you can come back at 11:45, when indeed it was clear to see their were 10 tables open and  no wait line. A bad call indeed a great way for customers never to return! Shame on you! I gave one star for the nice lady on the phone, however, they should hang a sign that reads \"reservations only for breakfast, any empty table means it's reserved!\"Your loss!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a restaurant near St. Patrick's church, because I had an interview over there, and although I wasn't able to get something filling to eat because of time restraints, they were able to keep up with my rushed pace while working at a similar pace of their restaurant, of which I really appreciated. On top of that, they were able to help me check out at the same at I was eating and I was able to leave early enough for that interview, And they saved my table for me, so that I could find a better parking spot. Although the prices aren't cheap, their service definitely make up for it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys local eats and/or wants a place to grab a bite close by the St. Patrick's Catholic Church."}
{"text":"Our party of six ended up here after a nearby restaurant was closed at the last minute.  It was a quiet night, so we got a nice table and had a great meal.  We all had a little something different.  Everything tasty, staff helpful and friendly.  Desserts were delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch. Had a variety of food:  Steak & Eggs: Potatoes were good, eggs were good (small?), but steak felt like a rough cut and was really chew for a medium rare. Meh.  Strawberry crepes: Delicious, light, not overly sweet, and fluffy. Really great.  French toast: thick cut, crispy and fluffy, not overly sweet, delicious.  Croque Monseuir: Nice ham, crispy bread.   Salt cod small plate: Really delicious, not overly salty or fishy, not overly oily and great aioli.  Overall, solid place."}
{"text":"This place is still just as good as I remember. It is a little gem of Cleveland and every time I go back I wonder to myself why has it been so long since I was here. I just love the food and atmosphere here. If you have neverr been you need to go. Good for a date night dinner. Never have had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Woohoo! BRUNCH CREPES!  I love crepe places. Cafe Zola in Ann Arbor is pretty distinct...but Le Petit Triangle Cafe is pretty cute in its own way, tucked away in Ohio City, off of 32nd st.  After browsing some reviews on yelp, my friend and I ventured over the bridge to Ohio City, to go EAT. Le Petit Triangle Cafe is definitely one of those hole-in-the-wall places, with a quaint/hippie-ish feel as you walk into the small cafe.  We were seated immediately. To start off, my friend ordered a mimosa while I ordered just their normal coffee.  The mimosa was actually pretty good, although I think they could have put in a tad more OJ. The coffee was GREAT. I don't remember the blend that they have, but I was surprised at how good it was.   After looking over the menu of brunch sandwiches, omelettes, etc etc, we decided to split two crepes- the smoked salmon and the chicken cheddar chutney. They were both super tasty. The crepes themselves, were different than most crepes I've tasted- I think it's because of the buckwheat flour or something of that sort? The smoked salmon did have a tad too much boursin to my liking, but nonetheless, still good. The chicken cheddar chutney was great as well- the mango chutney on top of the crepe was key. The crepes also came with a side of risotto and capers.. which were, well, your normal.  For dessert (yes, we had desert! haha), we got a sweet crepe- Tart Aux Pomme Crepe. It was cute- they even peeled the skin of the granny smith apples and placed it on top of the crepe. I found it to be a tad too tart for my liking- maybe if they had used a mcintosh or something more sweeter, I think I would have liked it better. Nonetheless, a great crepe.  There's also a gigantic nutella container on their counter that's the size of a basketball. I wonder where they get it....... haha.  Nonetheless, this a such a cute hole in the wall crepe place! I totally recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"They have good food but there are a lot of changes in the recent past. 1. They stopped serving savory crepes for dinner (hence why I will never eat dinner there again). 2. I saw a cook drink on the job. 3. My friend had a raw shrimp in his meal (even I know how to cook shrimp-not that hard) Overall, something fishy is going on with the place and that's a shame because it was one of my go-to spots."}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations and a recommendation from my friends. The first thing I noticed was that the server was friendly but due to the busy environment of the restaurant, the service was rather slow. The food came out after an hour of ordering.  I ordered the steak and eggs brunch item.  The potatoes were way too burnt and over cooked.  The steak was similar to a USDA Select cut. It wasn't that bad. However beware when you plan to go here with a group of more than 6 people. They will not take separate checks like other restaurants.  The waiter was rather reluctant and unwilling to give her best service to us. This place was honestly not worth the hassle and 3 hour wait time for the mediocre food and choice of service.  I would recommend this place for someone willing to try an upscale mom and pop diner."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Ohio city has a wealth of brunch places but the majority of them are a bit overpriced for what you get. This place however is as good or not better than the other options and also modestly priced. It's a little on the small side as far as room but we had no problem getting a spot and it fits the French cafe style pretty well."}
{"text":"This little creperie in Ohio City is definitely worth a visit! It's this tiny little place, but the owner is really nice, and there about 40 crepes you can choose from, including savory and sweet. They're really rich, though, so don't go if you're in the mood for healthy food. The crepes are fluffy, and there is a good variety of interesting choices, including cheddar, chicken and chutney, as well as the traditional complet, ham and gruyere, and of course, nutella and strawberries for dessert! It seems like it's better for breakfast and lunch than dinner. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the 1st time after shopping at the West Side Market.  I sat outside and ordered the apple and blue cheese salad with balsamic dressing, which was one of the best salads I've ever had.  Lots of blue cheese, which I love.  I'd never had a bellini before so I figured, what the heck...and discovered that I love those too!  The only negative was that the service was on the slow side.  However, that won't stop me from coming back; I'll just bring something to read."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Kent as soon as I found out about this place and it was completely worth it! I ended up sharing an appetizer with my date, we each had a half salad, each had our own entree, and then split dessert for only $50! Although the interior of this place is rather hole in the wall, the food is phenomenal! I can't recommend this place enough for anyone that enjoys French cuisine!"}
{"text":"Only been there once for brunch, but I will be making this a regular haunt.  Petit is right.  It's a tiny little place, very european in feel and execution.  Everything that hit the table (French Toast, Chicken Cheddar Chutney Crepe, Peanut butter and Chocolate Crepe) was outstanding.  Talking with the chef about some of the upcoming dinner specials had us dying to come back for dinner as well.  I suspect this place would make a great first date or anniversary dinner, it wasn't terribly romantic at 11am, but once the sun goes down, look out."}
{"text":"First time eating French food. The food was good but the wait to take our order and the food took a while. That is why I gave it a 4 star"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. The staff is incredible. They will guide you through a wine to pair with dinner and be happy to help. I had the duck and it was very good. Especially loved the sweet potato gnocchi. Finished with a housemade lemon curd crepe. Delish!"}
{"text":"Le Petit Triangle Cafe serves excellent crepes. Their crepes are large, well folded, and stuffed full of goodness.   First, I had the Mushroom Roquefort Crepe. The creminis paired very well with the Roquefort cheese, and best of all, the crepe was stuffed full of creminis and cheese. Next, I had a sweet crepe, which was filled with lemon tart. Once again, I got a hefty amount of filling, which paired very well with the bland crepe.   Service, however, was a bit slow. Despite the restaurant being only a quarter full, it took a bit of waiting for my friend and I to get our crepes. Other than that, this place is a solid choice for French food!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere and a place I definitely would like to do well. Nice staff too. The steak sandwich or whatever was great! It was a piece of steak served open face on bread covered in boursin, ate with a knife. I didn't know what half of the things on the menu were but all that I tried were good!"}
{"text":"Crepes crepes crepes! Did I mention this place has amazing crepes?! I am a brunch enthusiast and this is one of my go to places for brunch. It's quaint on the inside but the coffee and food is great. They have an open concept kitchen, and my only complaint with that is that you do leave smelling like food....bad but on the plus side you can see what/how they are cooking."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The first time I came here was when it was still \"Le Oui Oui Cafe\". It really is just a wedge inside a building. Very small dining room, only a handful of tables. The service is great and the food is even better. I am a huge fan of crepes, and their Lemon Curd is fantastic. I will continue to come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"There are three things I love about French cuisine: the breads, the sweets, and the cheese. Le Petit Triangle Cafe embodies these core French culinary delights that I treasure. My date and I came on a Saturday afternoon and were promptly seated in the front area with a clear view of the kitchen staff working their magic. It's a bit loud, but still hold the charm of a small cafe with the smell of coffee in the air and fresh flowers on all the tables.   Afternoon is the best time to come here because you can get sweet, savory, or a combination of both. You can order a cheese plate, croque monsieur, and get a nutella crepe for dessert. Unfortunately, I was't overly hungry when we arrived, so I stuck to one thing: the croque monsieur. There is something about the combo of ham, cheese, and super thick bread that makes me drool every time. Sure the ham and gooey cheese is to die for, but the bread here was even more fabulous. It has to be more than an inch thick with a slight sweetness that just meshes with the ham's saltiness so well.   I'm dying to come back here to try more brunch items. The crepes looked heavenly, but since I couldn't help but eat my entire sandwich, I did not have room to order one for myself. I may be wary about coming around dinner time on a weekend, as I'm sure the place gets quite loud. But for a cute lunch date with coffee and towering sandwiches, it's a win-win!"}
{"text":"An ok place, small with friendly staff. Not somewhere I would recommend to go if you're not in the area"}
{"text":"I had a great second visit at Le Petit Triangle. All the staff I interacted with were super cheerful and nice.   This time I tried a few more starters. I tried the salt cod and potato cakes. This resembled a crab cake or a potato pancake. It was held very loosely together and had a good serving of cod in it. There were two in an order.   The braised pork and red cabbage meatballs were also a good starter. The order came with three. These were also loosely held together; no or at least not a lot of filler. The flavor was good, mild but flavorful.   The charcuterie plate was a large serving of meats and pate mostly. There was a small selection of onions and pickles. There were a few large pieces of prosciutto and chorizo as well. The plate is served with two types of crackers of which you can ask for more.   For my main this time I got the Croque Monsieur. It was massive! The challah bread slice was huge. There was a perfectly fried egg (+$1) on top and thick layers of ham in between the bread. I would definitely order this again, but come hungry!   The patio here is really lovely. It was all shaded by awnings over the restaurant. It actually proved a bit cooler with the breeze than the restaurant interior which was getting a bit stuffy."}
{"text":"A beautiful, cute, small french restaurant in Ohio City. Le Petit always has high quality food and friendly customer service. It's a great date night restaurant, while also having affordable options. While they're crepes are yummy, I really enjoy their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Amazing croissants and crepes.  Cute little place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first experience here wasn't a good one. I got the Pork shoulder and duck cassoulet and the cassoulet was inedible and after 2 bites we couldn't force ourselves to eat it. The pork shoulder was tender but the sauce was very bitter. I decided to give it another shot and the the second time I ordered the duck breast and chicken cream crepe. The duck breast was delicious and cooked perfectly, and crepe was good as well. I got the lemon curd crepe for dessert and it was one of the best I've had. I'd definitely recommend the crepes on the menu. The atmosphere is cute and just like the name the cafe is a small triangle shape. The place has fresh flowers on every table and it really does feel like you've escaped to France for an hour!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a nice Saturday night. This place is nothing short of great. Menu items are very reasonably priced, and include a surprising amount of vegetarian options, a rarity at french restaurants. The onion soup is vegetarian and very good. Not many vegan options, but it is possible, again, very rare at a french restaurant. We were told that \"95% of the staff is vegetarian, so it's really easy for us to cater to you.\"  Our service was great, not too much or two little attention to our table.  Great atmosphere, great menu, Le Petit Triangle was perfect for a nice relaxed dinner. I wouldn't recommend it for groups larger than two or maybe four. The cafe, inside and out, is small, and I don't imagine it would cater well it a large group. This is the type of restaurant that is best enjoyed with a good friend or significant other."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today and really liked it. Small, comfortable and good ambience- the music was great, the set up was very cozy and the staff was very friendly and attentive. It did take about 25 minutes for our food to come out but once it did we were not disappointed. I had the spaetzle side dish (their version of mac and cheese), the quiche special (spinach, mushroom and tomato with a tasty side salad and an awesome raisin walnut toast). The spaetzle were great and flavorful, but the quiche was a little bland. However, the side salad was crisp and tasty (mixed greens, pistachios, cranberries and goat cheese with a vinaigrette). We finished up with a banana and Nutella crepe- delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing French cuisine. Crepes were amazing and the deli sandwich I had was delicious. My friends food was very good as well. Small, nothing too special but the food is all worth the while..."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite date night spot for my husband and I! We love everything on this menu. We appreciate that we can come here and not feel rushed. The happy hour is a must. This place has a special place in our hearts. A true gem in the CLE!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I are always bringing new people here because it is so good! Our favorite brunch spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Lemon crepes and strawberry crepes were amazing. Cute and quaint. Seating was a little awkward, hence the name petite triangle :-)"}
{"text":"I've only ever thought of Petit Triangle as a brunch/lunch place but after a wonderful dinner with friends there, I'm seeing it in a whole new light!   Famished as we were, our group ordered a veritable sampler buffet of offerings from the dinner menu:   - Salted Cod Cakes: These were incredible - an easy favorite for me. Light, crispy, and bursting with story herb flavor to balance the saltiness. - House Salads - Gazpacho - Cassoulet - Airline Chicken entree - Beef Bourguignon: Delicious and RICH!  - Croque Monsieur: Absolutely decadent. - Natural Crepe - Ginger Cheesecake: Tasty, with an unexpectedly strong ginger flavor.  If you guessed that our party of four rolled out of the Cafe stuffed to the gills and brimming with delight, you'd be correct! We lingered over our multiple courses while enjoying attentive service from our waitress and the cozy atmosphere. It was a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"I admit, it had been a while since I'd been to Le Petit Triangle.  It's sometimes a hard sell, especially from me because the only descriptive words I could remember were \"French, Small and Crepes\".    Honestly, it was so much more than that though!  We had to scour through the French dotted menu to identify what we wanted to order.  The hardest part was in the decision.  First our Bloody Mary's came, and they were honestly delicious.  They tasted like a special recipe, with just a little bit of bite and a more hearty taste than is typical.    For our Sunday brunch entree, we got a \"make your own\" omelette and one of the croque/sandwiches.  All the ingredients were fresh and the bechemel was amazing.  It made the entire meal feel rich and decedent.  The portions were also \"just right\".  They weren't huge Applebees plate fulls, but considering the quality and the richness, we walked away perfectly happy and full.    Our service was prompt (even with us being outside) and helpful.  I also loved seating on their tiny little patio.  It felt like a mini vacation."}
{"text":"Visited Sun 9/15/13, 2:30pm.  Stellar menu.  Pancake balls and pulled pork+egg sandwich for brunch.  Somewhat crowded, but service was prompt and friendly.  Sat on the patio, food delivered, tasty and hot.  Liked that they offered a water bowl for dogs."}
{"text":"This is one of our Favorite spots in Cleveland! It is in Ohio City in a fabulous old building. The decor is happy and very French. The service is always wonderful and the menu is wonderful. We all start with a savoury dish. Last night it was the fish, salmon crepe, trout salad and a cassoulet. Desert is a mix of sublime crepes. The bananas foster, chocolate crepes and the apple tart was perfect!  I highly recommend Le Petit Triangle!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute. Menu was full of yummy options. Would have liked to be away from the door. Be mindful to get there early and hope for a seat deeper inside, it's a small place. Or go when it's nice out as the outdoor seating looks great."}
{"text":"This is the perfect date spot. Great service, interesting menu, and I've always had excellent food (and they give you plenty of it).  Most reviews on here mention brunch but my experience has been two dinners.   I won't give many 5-star reviews but each time I've been here I've really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came here on our way to Toledo to visit family on the memorial weekend. Found this place on Yelp we've been to France and we are both fluent in French  thus we are greeted by the host who also spoke French a plus! he was nice but they were super busy.  The restaurant has a parisien feel very cool to in Ohio City hip. Ok to the review in short the food was awesome I mean very good I ordered the savory salmon crepe with a side of sausage. Very tasty and the carrot salad matched it perfectly.  Wifey ordered a salmon omelette with tomato they forgot the tomato but they remade it she also had a herbal tea I think blood orange it was great too and the homemade croissant were flaky soft warm everything you would want in  a croissant. The only reason I didn't give five stars and I really wanted to was because of the service my waitress was nice but they were slow and they just really  didn't have there stuff together it is recommended to have reservations or at least  for today I will definitely come back à bientôt!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of French cuisine but came here for a girls brunch. Luckily we had a big group and got a nice sized table in the large parlor. I kept hearing about how petite Le petite was and that ain't no joke. Walk thru the front door and it's a bit narrow without a lot of elbow room. Big parlor room was a little stuffy but they ended up opening the back door which helped some. Recommend the quiche and the salmon ceasar salad. Everyone at the table loved what they got. Also has a nice patio out in front. For good food prices were reasonable. I would come back"}
{"text":"The service really is as bad as everyone says it is. It's not that the servers are inherently rude or don't care, it seems this restaurant just has really.bad.organization. Upon coming in, you can see this place desperately needs a host stand, and an actual kitchen space, and probably just more tables in general. To give you some context, we made a reservation and still waited about 10 minutes for a table. After we were seated, it took another 15 minutes for the server to come over and get our drink order. On the upside, the server was very nice and apologetic and everything, she just seemed a little overwhelmed. The atmosphere is quaint, but also really hectic, which makes it hard to enjoy. I think the kitchen actually does a pretty good job of getting somewhat complicated dishes out in a reasonable time (I can say this because the kitchen is literally right in front of you as you're sitting in the restaurant) but the servers always seems to be overwhelmed, which is weird because it's easy to see that the ratio of servers to tables is actually pretty high. I think I would return here, but only if I knew for sure I wasn't in any hurry to be somewhere.   All that being said, the food here actually is better than I expected. My group tried the plain crepe along with the croque monsier, baucchalau benedict and ham and cheese omelette. Everything was prepared really well, the crepe was perfectly folded with just the right amount of butter and sugar (not too sweet) while the sandwiches were layered well and weren't drowned in sauce. The coffee was pretty good, although it could be better for a place that touts itself as a French cafe. Price-wise, I think it's more than fair for the portions you get as well as considering the atmosphere. Honestly, I think this place has a lot going for it, they just need a wholly better system for seating and serving."}
{"text":"I've been here many times of the 5 years living in Cleveland. Its a great stand bye for good inexpensive food in a very relaxed atmosphere.   Drinks: Nice, if not limited, selection of wine. Good specials. Coffee is good, but I've also had really great herbal tea here.   Appetizers: Nice variety and very good.   Entrees: Very good options and diversity. Heavy and comforting cassolette, sandwiches and of course savory crepes.   Dessert: Also many good options, but I would just about die for the chocolate lover's crepe with strawberries.  Overall, I am always happy when I go, the staff is very friendly and family oriented."}
{"text":"Long story short....Food was great...service was terrible.  Showed up on a random Tuesday afternoon for lunch, sat on the patio (no one is in the restaurant or on the patio at this point in time).  I'm working from the patio with my laptop....random couple enters and sits in the patio area as well.  Waitress comes out and addresses them first, sparks up a lovely conversation and apologizes for the wait.  She then walks over to me and asks if I wanted to see a menu with a bit of hesitation (I had been waiting there for about 10 min).  No real kick-off convo to make me feel comfortable with what's new on the menu or any daily specials.  After living in DC and Chicago for a while, I'm accustomed to better service with a smile.  Food was fantastic, just not sure if I would be willing to take a group of people here....even on a Tuesday."}
