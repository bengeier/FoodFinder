{"text":"The food and atmosphere are very good.
The lunch prices are very reasonable and the dinner scene is worth the additional price.

The carryout is an excellent option as well."}
{"text":"Switching up the sushi menu a liitle good new stuff. Deep fried key lime mousse good for a warm afternoon. Never can go wrong with Dragon & Phoenix"}
{"text":"My experience is contrary to the recent 1-star review here.  I am part of a business group that meets at Sabi every two weeks.  We usually have about twenty people.  Getting a group that size fed while we are conducting business in a reasonable time is a challenging task.  They always handle it well.  The quality of the food and service is always very good."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to try they're sushi rolls. The rolls were yummy and the fish light and fresh. There's 10 shushi bars we've gone to in the Davidson, Cornelius, Huntersville area and this one scored in the top 5. Clean, friendly and nice atmosphere.   Edit: The Address listed here is wrong... Its at 698 Griffith st. I tried to edit the business address and hopefully it gets corrected. Also added they're web ilovesabi.com which shows the correct address and has the menu."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday a couple of months ago. I was hesitate at first because I'm very picky on my food selection. To my surprise I had the BEST General Tso Chicken ever at this place! The customer service was excellent, the environment was nice and the food was super! I think everyone in our group was happy about their food and the portion are huge for the price that you pay. 

I will definitely go there again when I'm in the area.

*** 2/16/14- I just wanted to add to my review that my friends and I went back here in December for our Christmas gathering. As always the food was great, however we found out a month later that our waiter had stolen my cousins AMEX credit card number and made transactions at local bars back to back within the same evening and week! He must have used some sort of magnetic strip because she still had her card. After AMEX investigated on the transactions the places that he's gone to had specifically remembered the person who came in using that card and it was our waiter! Although the food is great, this bad experience will probably make us never go there again! (We've gone there three times in the past year to celebrate events) 

And if you go there make sure to just use your bank card or let alone cash because there is a theif that works there!"}
{"text":"Really nice Asian cusine. Nice ambience too. It's dinner menu all day on weekends. So, lunch might be a bit expensive on the weekends. However, the week day lunch is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I have only had their SUSHI and it's the best. If you are a SUSHI LOVER like me, this is the place. Make your next night, a SABI night."}
{"text":"The sushi lunch combo is what I got and is what I would recommend if you have never been here before and are trying this place out for sushi. It's a great introduction plate...also, it's not too much food and the chef chooses the 4 pieces of nigri for you, so you don't have to think about it.

I've ate here once before and I don't remember much from that experience other than the sushi was ok and it was expensive...but we did come during dinner. I hear lunch prices are more reasonable.

This second time, I just had the sushi combo and it was yummy. I was craving sushi and I absolutely loved it. If I wanted my stomach to hurt, I would have ordered a second plate, but since I was going back to my husband's work, I couldn't do that. If I was going home, I would have ordered 2 and just spent the rest of the afternoon on the couch with a full belly ache.

I will defintely come back to try the other things they serve."}
{"text":"Boring menu.   Lacking chef talent as their sushi is heavy on the rice, very light on the key ingredients, and high priced for what it is.  

Attractive dining room. Decent service.

My husband has been a sushi chef for 17+ years.  If you're craving sushi around Lake Norman, check out \"eeZ Fusion\" in Birkdale.  It's very expensive, and the rolls are very large, but it tastes so much better.  They are also very good with young children."}
{"text":"The real deal!! Been here many times and it just keeps getting better! Try the walnut shrimp dinner, it's da bomb!! Fresh sushi every time. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Sabi has a broad asian menu, but I have stuck exclusively to their sushi and have found it to be one of the better sushi options in the Charlotte area. The fish is reasonably fresh, and while not a huge sushi menu, there are a few highlights that make it worth the monthly visit. Look for the tuna and jalapeno roll (name escapes me), as well as the \"Lo-Carb Roll\" which replaces the rice with cucumber. Very comfortable dining environment, especially at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch recently and got the General Tso's chicken with Fried Rice.  It was not very good.  The chicken was just the fried breading in a thick, gooey sauce.  I like my General Tso's chicken to be actual chicken."}
{"text":"Staff that doesn't care, waitress that looks completely unhappy, bathroom are gross and the food is very plain. Sushi there sucks! Harris Teether has better sushi by light years away. 
Food took very long despite it was empty on a Saturday for lunch. 
I only give it 2 stars because the place is nice and the chicken Teriaky that my father in law got was not too bad. Everything else is a mess. Don't go there."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite! But after finding a black curly hair in our sushi today- the manager, Ken told us that \"all of his workers are Asian and don't have curly hair\"- none of us have black curly hair either! and they were not going to take the food off of our bill, until we basically argued with him! Absolutely terrible customer service- and a hair in your sushi?? DISGUSTING, and totally unacceptable!- we live and work in this town and will not recommend this place to anyone! The manager basically accused us of planting the hair in the food- even though none of us have black curly hair- and why would you be that rude to a customer? His attitude is what propagated this review, and the hair in our food was absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"If I had to sum this experience up in one word it would have to be incredible! Greeted upon entry. They were a little slow coming in and picking up leaving out. First time here...waitress Tarra was super helpful. Soup was only two bucks...I'll take two, hot & sour and miso...both outstanding...wife got egg drop which wasn't bad (coming from someone who doesn't like egg drop). She got pot stickers pan fried...really good. I got dragon and Phoenix...holy (can you curse here?). Best I've ever had ANYWHERE! Red curry shrimp, spicy and sticky general tsos chicken, veggies and fried rice. It was so good I didn't want to insult the integrity by taking leftovers home...so I finished it there. Wife got a dessert, key lime mousse cloud I think. Served with vanilla ice cream. Superb, I didn't know you could fry mousse...wow. I can't wait for my wife to get that kick for Asian good again so we can rush here."}
{"text":"Better have a few stiff drinks before eating here.  Bad takeout meal tonight.  First, ordering over the phone, the order taker couldn't understand that I wanted less meat and more vegetables in my LoMein.  The dish:  noodles overcooked and thick with almost no sauce.  5-6 little pieces of broccolli, Smaller pieces of pork that tasted like they'd been sitting in the fridge for a week.  The whole dish tasted like microwaved leftovers.  They forgot to include the sauce in my spring roll order, and the cold piece of teriaki shrimp tasted of rank old seafood.  I'm a regular, but after several experiences like this, I'm done.  Maybe the fact that they never seem to have the same staff has something to do with it.  This is a common problem with suburban Charlotte restaurants.  Just there to sell you overpriced alcohol, thinking that's all people want when they dine out.  Maybe they're right!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Davidson! Always great food,  pleasant staff! Great take out!"}
{"text":"Last night around 6:00 we came in with 6 friends. Several of whom had never been to Sabi. We bragged about the great food. When we initially arrived the weather was nice and we asked to sit outside. Before our food arrived we had to request clean water glasses, utensils and soy bowls as everything was dirty. After our food arrived it started to rain so we asked if could go inside. We had to take all our food and drinks in ourself with no help. Which was totally fine and no big deal. We were told where we could sit. At that point we never saw our waitress again. We had no waters, no refills on our wine. Nothing. I was embarrassed we had brought our friends to your restaurant and spoke so highly of it. A completely disappointing experience. -"}
{"text":"Food was ok but not \"wow\".  The sushi I had was average.  The spring roll wasn't so great.  I've certainly had better of both in other spots around the CLT region."}
{"text":"I was alone and ate at the bar. The service was fast and good. I had a rainbow roll that was tasty and sea bass for my entree. The sea bass was a very large portion that was cooked perfectly, moist with a very tasty sauce, it came with an assorted net of veggies that were cooked perfectly. I am a beer drinker and they have an outstanding selection. ThIs was my first visit here, I eat at Asian resturants all over the country and would highly recommend, the sea bass was fantastic!,"}
{"text":"In a town with very little choice of cuisine, the opening of Sabi is a virtual miracle. Sabi is right off the interstate and very easy to find. The restaurant has a cool vibe and nice seating inside and out. They offer a full bar and an extensive wine and beer selection. They offer a wide variety of Asian cuisine, including sushi. The noodle dishes are fabulous and taste as if they are prepared to order rather than in the beginning of the day and reheated. During my last venture to Sabi, I tried the Spicy Seafood Trio complete with the freshest fish at a very reasonable price. I cannot vouch for the authenticity of Sabi but its perfect for a date, a night out with the girls, or some takeout Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Wish they did more specials, as it adds up. Never had bad service or food in the 5 years! We come here for the great food and always get it"}
{"text":"Today is the fourth time in four months that Sabi has messed up my to-go order.  The first time, they gave me the wrong order.  The second time, they lost my order.  The third time, they gave me the wrong order again.  This time, they forgot to give me part of my order.  It is always a disappointment when I get home after picking up my order to see that it is wrong.  I am fed up with Sabi's to-go ordering and I will never pick up from there again.  Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Hadn't been there for a couple of years and it was not as I remembered. To start, the place was near empty and a non-verbal hostess leads us to the worse table in the place....in the bar area, directly across from the kitchen. Upon my refusal she takes us into the dining room and tries to seat us at a booth where the cushion was totally ripped up, finally on 3rd try we got a decent booth ... In a nearly empty restaurant at 7 pm.... First clue; leave restaurants that are near empty at 7 pm!  Table service was so so and food was blah... Nothing to write home about.  Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Ramen, pork belly and sushi. 
I thought this place was very good. Ramen was great, sushi was great; prices not so great. 

One pet peeve of mine, if you put it on a lunch special, or special in general, it should be a different price, specifically a lower price. 

Dinner Pork belly Ramen for $13, cool.  Lunch special Pork belly Ramen for $13? Shouldn't it be cheaper??

Place was clean, bathroom was clean. Hostess seemed unperson-able, like snobbish, our waitress seemed \"upset\", but cracked a few jokes at the end of lunch. I think that's just her personality, one of those I'm an a-hole unless you get to know me kind of people."}
{"text":"We went for a lunch. This is a pretty busy lunch place. The food was nice, nothing too awesome but was good.
The chicken was good. 
Server was not very happy with us, we were still eating and she put down the checks. I am giving 4 stars as the food was good. You can have good casual lunch but only if you are asian food fan."}
{"text":"Was there for the first time today and loved it!  Service was fantastic and so was the food.  I got miso soup and 2 sushi rolls.  The soup was great with lots of seaweed and tofu.  The rolls were excellent as well and tasted very fresh.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and good selection with lots of different kinds of Asian cuisine, but it can be a bit of a splurge for a college student on a budget. Usually easy to get a table, and they are very accommodating of large parties. Clean, modern decor."}
{"text":"Most of the food I have eaten here is pretty good, and it certainly is the best sushi in the area. I have eaten here many times over several years though and the service is consistently, and annoyingly, poor and slow. It is not that the servers themselves are bad, but they seem to have too many tables and not enough support on the floor. Every time I have come here with my kids it has been frustrating."}
{"text":"Sabi & I are friends, but not close ones.
I generally only get sushi here - volcano roll, deluxe Califonia roll, Alaska roll, & Philadelphia roll - but I've also had the shrimp pad thai.  Nothing really stands out to me as far as the food goes. It's always good, but not enough that makes me want to go there on a regular basis. 
They have an extensive menu, so surely there's something for everyone.
The wait staff are attentive & friendly & the restaurant itself is clean.  There's not much seating however."}
{"text":"Very nice place with a welcoming atmosphere. The waitress was very kinda and a pleasure to be around. The only down fall is the seafood ramen. The clam meat is so fishy it made the soup taste fishy. The portions are also quite big which is nice so expect a second meal or split it between two people. Overall quite a good restaurant I just wonder about some of the seafood they offer."}
{"text":"1. My third visit.  Kind of a long wait to be sitted.  Bunch of empty tables but hostess is no where to be found.  Finally, she showed up.  

2. Our waiter got two of four orders wrong.  I asked for a mild and he brought me extra spicy.  When I send back the order, he came back with the same food said there is not much difference between mild and extra spicy. Really? Who are you trying to fool here? 

Waiter did not check us but once.  Terrible service.  Bad.... I am not impressed with their food either."}
{"text":"Had the rainbow roll and combination low mein. It was great! Plate of low mein was enough for two people!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.I take my Mother here often,as it's close to Huntersville.Ken,the owner is great.I have tried several dishes here,never disappointed.You will not be either."}
{"text":"Food is just okay and the service is nothing to write home about. I guess that it is marginally better than mings or bonsai but that's not saying very much"}
{"text":"As part of a business group, we decided to try Sabi as a potential spot for our monthly meetings.  After our meeting, we were informed that we didn't generate enough money for them to consider us \"worth it.\"  Actually, \"worth it\" apparently means $500.  This didn't come from the server, but the owner.  He then informed us that we could perhaps try and find a spot at the bar next time, but a reserved table was out of the question.  Uh, no thanks.

As a former GM of a very successful restaurant, I am shocked that they would even consider telling guests that they were not good enough customers.  Now, as a business person, I can't imagine treating a customer with such disdain and disrespect. Not only will we not be back as a group, I will never be back as a customer...period.  I put up with their overpriced sushi and drinks before this incident, but when a business owner tells me he doesn't want my business, I will oblige him.  With pleasure."}
{"text":"Decent, but nothing special. Waiters need to clean up their stained aprons and appearances. Remember it being cleaner, more polished and more impressive food-wise when it first opened."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Davidson. Outstanding Asian fusion, great variety of Chinese/Thai dishes. The Royal Dish was spot on, the shrimp stir fry was also very good. Someone in our party had the filet, said it was one of best he's had. Prices are quite reasonable for this level of quality."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, not great. Service was slow (was there for dinner, maybe lunch is quicker). So again, nothing special. I wouldn't say no to going back but would not especially suggest or look forward to it."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a fan!  I must admit, I was really skeptical when my Aunt suggested to come here for dinner.  I have that NY snob attitude (quite proud of it too) \"Ahh Asian food in NC?  Can't be good.\".  And wow, was I wrong!  I ordered their special which was the Korean ribs and while it's not THE BEST I've ever had...they were pretty damn good.  If they offer this special while you're there, GET IT!  My Aunt ordered their shrimp lo mein and i'm thinking \"how good can a shrimp lo mein be...i mean come on!\".  I am ashamed to admit that it was the best shrimp lo mein I've ever had.  The staff was great and the place is clean.  The lighting is dim so I'd say it's semi romantic.  Next time I'm in NC again, I will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 7 times now, and I'm always pleased. Service is great, decor is nice, and food is great. My only complaint is that my chicken was overcooked last time. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"For the price point, the sushi is mediocre and the fusion dishes have very little flavor.  It is unfortunate as there are very few nearby restaurants that offer similar fare.  I'd recommend EEZ Fusion hands down."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Sabi in Davidson. Julie was awesome, taking great care of us. The meal was as good as last time, it's always nice to feel confident that whatever we order will be good."}
{"text":"We're in from Arizona and I have to say this is one of the best places we've eaten in a long time for amazing Asian food! 
The dish I had was the spicy Mongolian and I would highly recommend it. We also got the spicy edame and shared many rolls. Make sure you add this to you list of places to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Ask for the Mongolian Spicy Beef or Chicken, you will not regret it. Actually anything you ask for from the menu will be great. Came here to visit the University and am glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"Wanted to order the Crab Sushi Roll. However it was imitation crab meat. Sorry not paying 14 bucks for fake crab meat. Than I order the lamb chops for 22 bucks with spinach and white rice. I said may I get more spinach instead of rice. Up charge for that so I said never mind. Than it came with soup yet I was charged 2 bucks for soup. No thanks. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Above average food, friendly staff, reasonable lunch time pricing. Overall, not a bad place to stop and have lunch in Davidson"}
{"text":"Ok....was on the area on business , staying at hotel accross the street , needed food , bartender said place was good  , pretty decent reviews.... 

Sorry should have found BBQ instead... An L.A. native , with sushi everyplace thats top notch , what was I thinking.... 

Maybe im used to top shelf , but this was not worth it.......     Passable....


Ordered Thai tea , think it came out if a can , not tasty.. vegetable tempura with pineapple !!??  Octopus was rubbery , eel was cold .... just not it ...."}
{"text":"It's delicious food, at a great price. I can always find comfort food when I need it, or something new to try. It never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"I  was very upset tonight when the waitress told us they wouldn't allow them to accept tips on a credit card.  Cash only.  I found out later she was only a hostess and, thus, not categorized for receiving tips.  I understand how this industry works.  For wait staff tips make up the difference between their guaranteed wage ($2.13) and minimum wage ($7.25).  This individual was most likely making a guarantee of minimum wage or more, and it was not within the constraints of management to allow more for her.  If they are short on wait staff, I feel they should allow their hostesses to receive the gratuity regardless."}
{"text":"I joined yelp just to write a review for this restaurant. Stellar service! And incredible food! We had a fussy baby because she's teething, and our waiter brought us bread for her to gnaw on and gave us chopped up bananas! So considerate. Then when they ran out of ice cream at the end of the night (we were there at 10:30) they ran across the street and got us some ice cream! Plus, the food was great! Don't you always hate it when restaurants short you on meat or shrimp? Well there was a plethora of shrimp in my kung pao dish. It was definitely the best Chinese food I've had, and I'm from San Francisco, Asian food central. 

Love this place! It's a must! And for those of you people dissing their sushi menu, you have no idea what you're talking about. This place tops sushi ran, an exclusive asian restaurant in Marin country, CA."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find decent Asian food deep in the middle of North Carolina, but is was ok. They have basically taken some of the most popular dishes from different cultures and put them together on the menu. From sushi to orange chicken to pad thai. They have a nice martin in list too."}
{"text":"After trying this place a few times, I have to come at least once every two weeks!! The service is good, but the sushi is amazing. Especially the salmon- roll or sashimi. You can get a side of fried rice for $1.50 with two rolls and get a great dinner for $12. The sushi is the best in the lake Norman area and not outrageously priced."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, ambience, EVERYTHING!
On our first visit we had the wonton dip. Sooo good! Pretty addicting. 
Our entrees were the Dragon & Phoenix and the Mongolian beef. Both were the perfect amount of spice and the portions were huge. You will definitely have some leftovers for lunch the next day. 
Our service was beyond excellent! We were pleased with our server. She really was amazing and so helpful. She gave us excellent recommendations. Our food was fabulous. 

On our second visit (second time in a week!)  we had the wonton dip again, still very yummy. Our entrees were were the royal and the Korean BBQ ribs, which was a special. Sooooooo good!!!! Our service was good the second time but not as great as the first. 

  I honestly LOVE this place! We will be back for lunch later this week."}
{"text":"Server was great, interior really nice, and prices reasonable. Food was average. The red curry had fresh veggies but they were a little undercooked. The dish was bland, but a little salt and spices and I was good to go."}
{"text":"Singapore Rice noodles are a 4/5, inside out crab Rangoon dip was tasty. Dragon & Phoenix is a 2/5 and not worth of a $15 price tag ( chicken over breaded and sauce pretty bland). Beer and wine menu is creative and diverse for a small collection. The Wildcat roll (Sushi) is just average 3/5 and uneventful in flavor. Maybe this was an off night as my lunch a few days earlier was a 4/5."}
{"text":"Went to Sabi's for the first time with a co-worker for lunch.  The restaurant has a very warm feel to it which was great because it was a chilly rainy day when we came.  

Everything on their menu looks really good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. I finally decided on the Spicy Thai Red Curry with Chicken, it was really good and had great flavor but really didn't have that much spice to it but I like my food spicy so someone who doesn't like spice would probably say the dish is spicy.  Sabi dishes are big enough that both me and my co-worker had leftover for lunch the next day.  I will definitely come back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Pacific fried and that's how I roll were good and so was the service. I only gave 3 stars because the sushi bar could have been cleaner (there was dried soy sauce on the counter and wall) and the bathrooms were dirty and they only had been open for 45 minutes! Just seems like they have slipped a bit in the last couple of years."}
{"text":"This place is family owned. All pride and quality. I've lived in Chicago, NYC, Denver, Atlanta, Iowa City, Omaha, and Columbus Mississippi. This restaurant is better than anything I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Another Groupon brought us to this restaurant. California roll was very good - Husband not a fan of sushi, but said the Fried Rice was the best he's had! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Meh as others have said the food is alright and the service is not great, the waitress was so unhappy it almost made you feel bad for her. When we walked in they sat us at the worst booth with ripped seats a large dead mosquito on the table. When we asked for spinach, Bok Choy and mushrooms on top of rice (for the vegetarian at our table) we were told that they wouldn't accommodate us because it was against health code to make something that wasn't on the menu...The lettuce wraps tasted very odd, I really don't recommend them. The sushi was grocery store qualify. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, reasonable prices. Great dinners to split with others for a great variety. Good for picky kids too!"}
{"text":"We visited Sabi on a recommendation from a friend.   We came here a number of years ago and what a change.    I was really impressed with the food a we will definitely be back.  

We started with the calamari as an appetizer.   It was pretty good.  For our main dishes we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and the Sabi Stir Fry (chicken and shrimp).  Both dishes were done very well and had good portion size.   For the Kung Pao the chicken was not fried which is always a good thing.   It was tender with good flavor.   The vegetables that were in the dish were plentiful and done very well.  

Overall the experience was very good and will make it a point to come back often."}
{"text":"Cute little Asian bistro. I ate here for a work lunch. Service was fast and efficient. They do a great sushi lunch combo; 2 rolls and a soup or salad for $9.95. It was perfect for me. Thank you, Sabi!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Sabi after hearing about it from my co-workers.  It's also a plus that it's right down to road from our campus.  First thing I noticed when I walked in for lunch was the place was dead...  For a Saturday lunch, I thought the place would more active, I think it was me and a family at the next table.  This was a concern to after walking in....did I make the right choice?  

Exploring the menu, it's very similar to your American/Asian fusion.  They also have sushi here.  After driving for 9 hours, I wanted something more filling and I went with the Lo Mein.  I can say the food here was really good.  It doesn't have that MSG-overload feeling you get from your typical Chinese take-out.  I would even go out of my way to say this place beats PF Changs and has better food quality!

Reason for the 3 stars was, the host was very friendly walking in.  My waitress just seemed like she did not want to be there.  Food is undeniably gets 4 star, the service took that away. 

If you're in the Davidson area, I would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch. Sushi was fresh and delicious. Had a roll with tuna, salmon and shrimp. Very good. Miso was really tasty not too salty. I will go back."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either. The patio outside is nice, service ia great and quick. Menu options are great as well. Wine options are goos but nothing that you can't get at a local Walmart. However the wines they picked are great aside from the fact they are widely available. The food is okay. Portions are big enough but as far as for the Chinese style food I got you can get better at PF Changs."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and if you are taking a kid I recommend going a little early and sitting on the patio. The staff was great - encouraged our little one to explore and stretch his legs before the food came. The food had nice flavors - the broccoli beef was actually very tender. My husband had fish and loved it. Everyone I've taken here raves about the sushi and I enjoy the hibachi stir-fry and crab cakes. The sesame chicken comes in a delicious sauce. The service is good, the atmosphere is great for a date. Only negative thus far are the martinis; of the three we ordered, only one tasted good."}
{"text":"The Thai chicken was good, plenty of meat and veggies coated in a spicy Thai sauce. The shrimp fried rice was good with plenty of shrimp. The spring rolls were tasty. The pot stickers were pan fried just right. The vegetable li neon was tasty and the vegetables were crispy and fresh. 
BTW, this was take out."}
{"text":"I like Sabi because it's a great place right in the heart of downtown Davidson and the quality is always good. They have a great sushi selection as well as many other eclectic options. One of my favorite dishes is the Combination Lo Mein.  Their bang bang shrimp and crab Rangoon are delicious as well. Go try this place."}
{"text":"This is our usual lunch place and so far it has never disappointed us. Nice and happy service with good food! Mongolian beef is the group fav along with basil chicken n tofu. It gets a little crowded though after 12. We've had few office dinner parties too and they have always had good stuff for all!"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion done correctly. 

When you walk in, this place doesn't seem like anything special but I after my experience, I would come back in a heartbeat. 

I was staying at a nearby hotel with a few friends and we decided to grab some food nearby. The place was almost empty when we got there around lunch time, which made us skeptical. When we looked at the menu and saw that it was Asian fusion, I became even more skeptical. It's not that easy to find a place that serves pad thai, sushi, and orange chicken. It's much, much more difficult to find a place that serves a variety of Asian and does it well. But after trying the food, I was happy. We had multiple types of sushi, edamame, pad thai, and orange chicken. Everything was well prepared. Nothing was standout. Sabi still get's 4 stars though because they do this many types of Asian well."}
{"text":"This was perfect for what I wanted. The staff was super nice, and helpful. It was cozy, elegant but casual and really delicious! I will definitely go there again and hope they have the 'Kick A**\" rolls next time too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited there a few months ago and stopped for a late Sunday lunch, and a pleasant surprise. The interior was pleasant and clean. The server was friendly and helpful by locating some gluten free soy. We all enjoyed our rolls, that were fresh with outstanding sauces and colorful to the eye. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I ate here for the 1st time last night even though I've lived in Davidson for 5 years, now.  I ordered that General Tso's chicken.  Let me tell you..... that was the BEST General Tso's I've ever eaten and I've lived in 3 different states.  The fried rice was NOT greasy like most other Chinese places.  I left happy and satisfied!  No complaints!  The only regret is that I forget to take a photo of my meal."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  They have a great selection of sushi, appetizers and Asian fusion dishes.  We really like the Kick A** & TJ roll, among others.  The ginger sea bass was great, love the pad thai & traditional dishes.  You really can't go wrong, it all just depends on what you feel like for the evening.  It'll all be great.  

They have a large patio for outdoor seating & a private room, if you need it for a meeting or party."}
{"text":"Sabi is a pretty good Asian Fusion place in the Davidson Area.  It's filled a niche that has existed since Bonsai went away (yes, the last time I was in Davidson Bonsai was still there), but doesn't really do anything more to be outstanding.  I had dinner here with family recently, and it was on a popular Friday night, so there was a bit of a wait to get a table.  The staff was cordial but obviously busy and not as attentive and direct as could have been.

Their food is typical American Asian food, with a combination of Japanese, Chinese, Thai available.  We got the Bang Bang shrimp for an appetizer, and while the sauce was flavorful, it was in not in any way spicy (as my brother who eats hot hot food remarked).  My wife hit the Sushi, and was pretty pleased with it overall, the nori wasn't overly damp and slimy and the proteins in the rolls she got were fresh.  

Continuing the spicy trend, I had the Spicy Mango Chicken, which was pleasantly hot and while the Mangos were slightly underripe, I actually preferred them that was as they provided a cooling presence for the meal.  My brother had the General Tso's, a classic, and felt that it was a bit bland, but knowing his spicy tastes, that's not saying much.

The plates were filling, however my one complaint here is that certain dishes seem over-priced for what you're getting.  Perhaps it's just the Lake Norman inflation effect, but the value here is not overwhelming.  Certainly not bad if you're in Davidson and looking for a close (even walkable from the downtown and much of the college) Asian themed place to eat, but keep your expectations at that."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. They have the best ginger salad I've ever had. Their scallion lamb is delicious. Although it costs $14, it is big enough for two or even three people. They also have a lot on their lunch menu that is really cheap and affordable like the Sa Cha chicken and Kung Pao chicken. For three of us, the bill was $24 + tip for lunch and one of us even ordered sushi and drinks.
A must-try place for all Asian cravings."}
{"text":"It's OK. I can't go beyond 3 stars.

The sushi was fine, I had an assortment of nigiri and my buddy had sashimi.
Between the two of us, we've sampled a good range of their sushi and even had a roll thrown in there. The verdict is -- sushi is so-so.  Not bad but nothing that will take your breath away. 

I was hoping they have a decent collection of sake but nothing like that."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some decent sushi! If you're in the mood for some yummy sushi but not looking to spend $$$$, Sabi is a good option. They have a large variety of items on their menu for the non-sushi fans. Their inside out crap dip and pan seared dumplings appetizers are great!"}
{"text":"Be warned that the sushi is the worst! We took a bit and threw it away. We had the ShaCha Chicken and Pad Thai. ShaCha was good, Pad Thai not so good."}
{"text":"The Wildcat roll is my favorite, but everything I've had has been delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely retarded autistic horrible service. Waiters are nice but it is absolutely unacceptably slow to warrant being a restaurant that exists. Food is good though from what I can tell, but I haven't gotten mine yet. I'm just writing this review out of hungry frustration."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! The food and service is great! A healthy version of a Japanese steakhouse. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. My entire family loves this place! Never a disappointment. Sushi is among the best at the lake for quality."}
{"text":"Big sad face. Totally disappointing. So it's my birthday & since we have a baby & never go anywhere anymore, I decided I just wanted husband to pick up sushi & bring home as my special birthday dinner. Totally regret choosing this place. 

1. The Brunt Roll failed miserably. The crab on top was mostly bland fried breading and warmed up the California rolls underneath enough that they just weren't very appetizing once I got to them :-X
2. Bang Bang shrimp appetizer, the only saving grace, 3.75 out of 5 stars... good taste just a little soggy
3. Inside Out Wonton Dip HUGE disappointment I blame a recent Yelp review for. I'm sure different cooks make it differently but mine tonight was just NOT good & usually you get sweet N sour sauce I thought, maybe that would have made it a little more edible.
4. Husband got the sweet & sour chicken and it was OK he said, nothing worth ordering again though.

It's sad that one of the few sushi places around was so disappointing :/"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, trendy restaurant with good service. The sushi is average and over priced. Basically, if you order a roll with certain ingredients, that's all you will get; nothing more to add flavor.  The \"Asian\" food is decent, but you can get it at an actual Asian restaurant and enjoy something more authentic.

Very convenient location, but would not go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Yumm. That's all I need to say. Like I've seen in the other reviews, I've never had a bad meal here. The sesame chicken is my favorite. There's something about the sauce/glaze they make it with that you just can't get anywhere else. And again, rice. That's so basic, but Sabi's is just so much better. Plenty of parking at night and on the weekend because it is in a business park area. I wish they had another location in Charlotte, because the 77 construction makes it a long ride up but it really is worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and the customer service is
horrendous. Lack of knowledge and customer service skills. The staffs are young and dumb. This place just doesn't seem sanitary at all. Simply disgusting! They are lucky to have any business due to the lack of any other good Asian choices around."}
{"text":"Ok, first they have 3 front door hostess and yes they are all very pretty but not very good at welcoming the guests. We arrived on Saturday night and did not know we needed reservations. We tried with open table but they do not use it. We were told it was a wait and we should sit at the sushi bar, we said not thank you we will wait at the bar and we were told on no, just sit at the sushi bar, the bar is crowded. Portions are good but the staff way to casual and the food. ok, not the best I have had. The place in Mooresville is twice as good for half the price. The atmosphere is nice but the whole mix of Asian fusion is just covering the gamete abut not really delivering on any one type. Since the place was recommended to us, I was really disappointed. I will take quality over quantity any day. I am really surprised it was so crowded. hummmm"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. Around 2:00pm. Not busy at all. Seated right away and the waitress and hostess were very nice. 

The food was delicious! Got a couple sushi rolls that were very fresh and flavorful. I imagine this place getting very busy during the peak hours with food that good! 

I didn't give it 5 stars because the girls bathroom was in disarray. Definitely need to sink some money into fixing toilet seats and toilet paper dispenser."}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time this evening. Our food was not very good, very disappointing, especially for the price. Won't be eating here again. Pad Thai was nothing like it should have been, it was dry and flavorless. Beef  Lo-Mein was the same, dry and no flavor."}
{"text":"two words: sushi and pad-thai (Its my review, so Im letting 'pad-thai' go down as one word ;)). They have GREAT sushi: the Ace and TJ and the Subway are AMAZING. Their pad thai is pretty good too.
They have to work on their desserts tho. Have tried some and didnt like them."}
{"text":"Pros: This restaurant was very lively and filled with good energy. We were seated and served very quickly.  The waitstaffs were attentive and did a good job keeping up with our drinks.  

Cons: I had Singaporian Noodle which was milder than those that I had at other restaurant so like it but don't love it.   We also ordered Sashimi and Sushi which I thought were ok - not the best Sushi I ever had.  

Overall: I would stick to the Asian Fusion dishes here and save the Sushi ordering for places like Nikko and Musashi.  This is more of a place to go with a group for  above average meals not a place to go for authentic Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Sabi is my all-time favorite restaurant... and i go there whenever I can. If you guys can't find much on the sushi menu I have to recommend one of four items: The Pacific Fried Roll, The Southern Baked Roll, The Ace & TJ Roll (very expensive though), or the Wildcat Roll. All are positively yummy and I have a horrible time deciding what to get because I love them all.

On the regular menu, I have to recommend the Walnut Shrimp right off the bat. Their Hibachi Shrimp is also very good, but I don't normally get regular food here so I can't recommend more.

The service is meh, IF you get the one waiter who doesn't make an effort. I havent seen him a while, so maybe he actually got fired... however the best waiters there are Parker and Renee. Both are attentive, always friendly, and just good waiters. 

This is not one of those tiny sushi places where they are focused on you and maybe a couple more tables. This is a big restaurant, but it maintains good service with a comfy vibe (if at times a bit loud in the back or near the bar) and a competent wait staff. 

I've got to recommend Sabi as a lunch or dinner option if you're nearby. Dinner is of course pricier than lunch, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been looking for good Asian food and hadn't found it yet in Charlotte. Thank goodness for my trip to Davidson to try Sabi! It was a great space (lots of tables) and there was an actual parking lot (so you don't have to parallel park). It isn't in downtown Davidson, but it's close to 77, which is convenient for me.

I had the chicken Pad Thai and it was delicious. The dish was so large it made 3 meals for me, which was another plus. I'll definitely come back...maybe try something else on the menu...maybe not."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight after purchasing a deal through Living Social recently. It was ok, but in the end I wasn't a fan. The place was missing a lot. Maybe it's because I came for sushi and it's not a place fully devoted to sushi, or maybe I'm just picky.

We had a reservation for 6:30 and were sat within under a minute. The restaurant itself was not what I expected. It was a bit too big and bright for my taste. I prefer a quieter establishment when I eat sushi, and this place was so loud that there was a lot of \"huh?\" and what?\" between the miss' and I. Our server was attentive but pretty impersonal and we felt pretty rushed. I'm sure a good part of it was that it was a busy night and maybe he was just swamped. 

Another issue I had was with the sushi menu. It was LAME. When I go to a sushi place, I want to see the chef's super duper fancy rolls. Sabi's menu was very lacking in this regard and the menu was made up of pretty \"meh\" rolls. We ended up ordering a Dragon roll, California roll, and Phili roll. Oh, and one other thing I have to say is that the draft beers are a varied selection and come at a cheap price.

We started with an appetizer of fried calamari (one of my weaknesses). Sabi's calamari is fried in a tempura batter and served with plenty of pepper and a spicy sauce. I've never had fried calamari tempura-style, and I never will again. It's a heavy coating and proved to be too heavy for the calamari as I tasted more fried goodness than seafood. I have nothing against fried food, but I'm extra judgemental of calamari and the lack of taste was sad. In it's defense I have to say that the sauce was pretty good and complimented the tempura well.

The rolls were average, if not a little below. They were very \"ricey\" so they were heavier than what I'm used to in sushi rolls. The California roll was pretty bland, even with the extra fish they layer on top. The Dragon roll was my favorite of the three but it was still nothing that blew my mind. As for the Phili roll...we haven't had that in quite a number of years. I guess we felt that we \"graduated\" beyond such \"beginner rolls\". Yet with such a blah menu where nothing really jumped out at us, we decided to have a blast from the past with the Phili. It was ok, but nothing special.

I think my biggest problem with Sabi is that it just doesn't stand up to other restaurants I've been to. A place I consider \"average\" goes about one or two steps above Sabi. I won't be coming back to Sabi, and next time we go out for sushi we'll either explore someplace new or stick with what we know at eeZ Fusion."}
