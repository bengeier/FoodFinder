{"text":"Enjoying a steaming bowl of Beef Sate!  Absolutely perfectly seasoned and generous serving of beef.  So good.  With the wedge of lime provided and bean sprouts you put on top yourself - just kicks it up to another level.  Divine and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place finally opened around the start of the new year, having seemingly been in construction limbo for the past year in the location of the old Choices restaurant.  The place looks a lot nicer, but like a lot of ex-Choices customers, I came for the take-out.  Danger sign: a Vietnamese place without takeout that didn't mention the word \"Pho\" anywhere. I had to (correctly) assume that the Saté was indeed referring to the Pho (okay, it did say noodle soup as well somewhere...).  After factoring in the cost of the soup ($13.50), an order of 2 spring rolls ($3.50) and a 15% tip (because that pops up right away on the debit machine, and I thought I'd be encouraging a good experience with a tip) I was looking at $19 and change. Pretty expensive for a lunch!  So, the pho was... meh. The serving size seemed a bit smaller than other places (although that might have been my imagination). There was a cellophane baggie with bean sprouts and a tiny lime wedge. No basil, which is practically required to enjoy pho! And the broth was... meh. Spicy, but more like spicy chicken soup than Pho, lacking complexities and subtle flavours found in better pho. The spring rolls were good, though.  So overall, more expensive than the competition, possibly smaller serving sizes, and mediocre broth. Not a pho experience I feel like repeating, and a disappointment as I was hoping for something better than the former Choices delivered."}
{"text":"Was craving some pho soup so decided to come here for a hearty bowl of pho! I was extremely disappointed - the broth had 0 flavour. Not sure why they refer to themselves as a Vietnamese cuisine because their food tastes nothing like it. Portions are tiny - they literally give you 10 bean sprouts (you can count them..that's how little they give you!). Lastly, their prices are outrageous. $13 for a bowl of soup, which isn't even a bowl of pho soup. I DO NOT recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The house-made vegetarian spring rolls are out of this world. The dish comes with two crispy rolls that are perfectly loaded with chopped up celery and carrots. The vermicelli dishes are my favourite as they are loaded with protein and vegetables (I highly recommend #20 or #21 on the menu).  The servers are very attentive and efficient and never hesitate to refill the waters - which by the way, have a perfect hint of sweet cucumber notes. Very refreshing!"}
{"text":"This place is the most overpriced Vietnamese restaurant I've been to for what you get and rests on its laurels of being located downtown in a busy indoor environment with little to no competition in the way of Vietnamese cuisine besides having to walk to China Town. The buns are overpriced and lacklustre - little in the way of vegetables besides bean sprouts (so not even colourful visual appeal with cucumber, carrot and cilantro like most places).  The sate soup is average at best and so are the stir fry dishes on rice. A big disappointment for such a highly anticipated opening which took months longer than planned.  Take out customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"Disappointing... to start the menu is pretty limited. A few soups, a few vermicelli bowls, a few stir fries.  No traditional pho and like 2 noodle soup options.   I got the shrimp salad rolls and the peanut sauce tasted kind of funny. Got a pork vermicelli bowl and there were big leaves of lettuce, not shredded lettuce. And the meat was cold. The hoisin at the table, again, didn't taste like hoisin.    The tables are so close together and it was very loud. Not really enjoyable.   Service was good - fast and friendly. But being so close to Chinatown I won't be back."}
{"text":"I like the fact that its close to work. Inside the plus 15, so you don't really have to go outside on cold days. Came here and got the shredded pork, with BBQ and spring roll vermicelli bowl. It was ok. Decent. Nothing like spectacular. Prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly. Best part is that they serve cucumber water.   My colleague left her phone and the staff safe kept it for her until my colleague returned for her phone. Very honest people and very thankful.   I do like this place for its convenience.   It can get quite busy during lunch time. So you have to come before noon. Also, the food comes out pretty quick.  Décor is nice. Trendy and clean."}
{"text":"Great new Asian lunch place for the downtown core. Appropriate price point and portions. Great service and selection of import beers at a reasonable price!"}
